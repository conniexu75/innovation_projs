https://openalex.org/W2035397082,"Organic-inorganic hybrid materials promise both the superior carrier mobility of inorganic semiconductors and the processability of organic materials. A thin-film field-effect transistor having an organic-inorganic hybrid material as the semiconducting channel was demonstrated. Hybrids based on the perovskite structure crystallize from solution to form oriented molecular-scale composites of alternating organic and inorganic sheets. Spin-coated thin films of the semiconducting perovskite (C(6)H(5)C(2)H(4)NH(3))(2)SnI(4) form the conducting channel, with field-effect mobilities of 0.6 square centimeters per volt-second and current modulation greater than 10(4). Molecular engineering of the organic and inorganic components of the hybrids is expected to further improve device performance for low-cost thin-film transistors."

A combination of two phenotype-based screens, one based on a specific posttranslational modification, the other visualizing microtubules and chromatin, was used to identify compounds that affect mitosis. One compound, here named monastrol, arrested mammalian cells in mitosis with monopolar spindles. In vitro, monastrol specifically inhibited the motility of the mitotic kinesin Eg5, a motor protein required for spindle bipolarity. All previously known small molecules that specifically affect the mitotic machinery target tubulin. Monastrol will therefore be a particularly useful tool for studying mitotic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2158627784,"Double-stranded (ds) RNA can induce sequence-specific inhibition of gene function in several organisms. However, both the mechanism and the physiological role of the interference process remain mysterious. In order to study the interference process, we have selected C. elegans mutants resistant to dsRNA-mediated interference (RNAi). Two loci, rde-1 and rde-4, are defined by mutants strongly resistant to RNAi but with no obvious defects in growth or development. We show that rde-1 is a member of the piwi/sting/argonaute/zwille/eIF2C gene family conserved from plants to vertebrates. Interestingly, several, but not all, RNAi-deficient strains exhibit mobilization of the endogenous transposons. We discuss implications for the mechanism of RNAi and the possibility that one natural function of RNAi is transposon silencing."
https://openalex.org/W2109183032,"Human sex chromosomes evolved from autosomes. Nineteen ancestral autosomal genes persist as differentiated homologs on the X and Y chromosomes. The ages of individual X-Y gene pairs (measured by nucleotide divergence) and the locations of their X members on the X chromosome were found to be highly correlated. Age decreased in stepwise fashion from the distal long arm to the distal short arm in at least four ""evolutionary strata."" Human sex chromosome evolution was probably punctuated by at least four events, each suppressing X-Y recombination in one stratum, without disturbing gene order on the X chromosome. The first event, which marked the beginnings of X-Y differentiation, occurred about 240 to 320 million years ago, shortly after divergence of the mammalian and avian lineages."

https://openalex.org/W2105381977,"Generation and maintenance of an effective repertoire of T cell antigen receptors are essential to the immune system, yet the number of distinct T cell receptors (TCRs) expressed by the estimated 10(12) T cells in the human body is not known. In this study, TCR gene amplification and sequencing showed that there are about 10(6) different beta chains in the blood, each pairing, on the average, with at least 25 different alpha chains. In the memory subset, the diversity decreased to 1 x 10(5) to 2 x 10(5) different beta chains, each pairing with only a single alpha chain. Thus, the naïve repertoire is highly diverse, whereas the memory compartment, here one-third of the T cell population, contributes less than 1 percent of the total diversity."

Since the precise molecular target of soluble RAGE in those settings was not elucidated, we tested the hypothesis that predominant specific AGEs within the tissues in disorders such as diabetes and renal failure,N ε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) adducts, are ligands of RAGE. We demonstrate here that physiologically relevant CML modifications of proteins engage cellular RAGE, thereby activating key cell signaling pathways such as NF-κB and modulating gene expression.

AGEs are a heterogeneous class of compounds, whose accumulation in disorders such as diabetes, renal failure, Alzheimer's disease, and, indeed, natural aging, albeit to a lesser degree, has suggested their potential contribution to the pathogenesis of complications that typify these conditions (3Brownlee M.

Our recent studies suggested that interruption of the interaction of AGEs with RAGE in vivo, by administration of soluble RAGE (sRAGE), the extracellular ligand-binding domain of RAGE, reversed vascular hyperpermeability and suppressed accelerated atherosclerotic lesion development and complexity in diabetic rodents (19Wautier J.-L.

In the latter studies, analysis of plasma demonstrated evidence of an sRAGE·AGE complex; immunoprecipitation of plasma obtained from diabetic sRAGE-treated mice with anti-RAGE IgG yielded species immunoreactive with both anti-RAGE IgG or affinity purified anti-AGE IgG, suggesting that sRAGE might bind up AGEs and limit their interaction with and activation of cell surface RAGE. The beneficial effects of sRAGE were independent of alterations in other risk factors, such as hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, implicating a role for AGE-RAGE interaction in the development of vascular dysfunction in diabetes (20Park L. Raman K.G. Lee K.J. Yan L. Ferran L.J. Chow W.S. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). These past studies, however, did not elucidate the precise AGE(s) that trigger signal transduction mechanisms upon engagement of RAGE. We thus sought to test specific AGE structures for their ability to bind RAGE on the surface of cells such as ECs, MPs, and VSMCs in order to determine their role in cellular activation. In this context, recent biochemical and immunohistochemical studies suggested that N ε- (carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) modifications of proteins are predominant AGEs that accumulate in vivo (21Dunn J.A.

Importantly, enhanced accumulation of CML was shown in vascular tissue, atherosclerotic lesions, and glomerular tissue retrieved from diabetic rodents and human subjects (25Berg T.J. Clausen J.T.

These observations are consistent with the concept that beyond processes mediating glycoxidation of proteins (31Ahmed M.U. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4889-4894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lipid oxidation itself triggers generation of CML (32Fu M.X. Requena J.R. Jenkins A.J. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. J.

Niskanen L.K. Siitonen O. Voutilainen E. Pyorala K. Circulation. 1990; 82: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent findings suggested that CML modifications may form directly as a consequence of activation of the myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-chloride system, thereby providing a mechanism for conversion of hydroxy amino acids into glycoaldehyde, a precursor in the steps leading to formation of CML (34Anderson M.M. Requena J.R. Crowley J.R. Thorpe S.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These findings may have direct implications for inflammatory processes that characterize certain complications of diabetes and renal failure, for example, such as atherosclerosis, impaired wound healing, aggressive and inflammatory periodontal disease, and dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) (6Miyata T. Oda O. Inagi R. Iida Y. Araki N. Yamada N. Horiuchi S. Taniguchi N. Maeda K. Kinoshita T. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar,35Inoue N. Nishikata S.

Consistent with these concepts, previous studies placed RAGE in the vascular and inflammatory milieu characteristic of disorders in which AGEs, such as CML, accumulate; indeed, expression of RAGE is enhanced in these settings, beyond that observed in normal adult tissues (37Brett J. Schmidt A.M. Zou Y.S. Yan S.D. Weidman E. Pinsky D.J. Neeper M. Przysiecki M. Shaw A. Migheli A. Stern D.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1699-1712PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ritthaler U. Roth H.

Taken together, therefore, these considerations suggested that examination of CML adducts of proteins as potential specific AGE ligands for RAGE was a logical step. Here we report that CML-modified proteins engage cellular RAGE in vitro and in vivo to activate key cell signaling pathways such as the transcription factor NF-κB, with subsequent modulation of gene expression. Together, these findings link CML-RAGE interaction to the development of accelerated vascular and inflammatory complications that typify disorders in which inflammation is an established component. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), bovine serum albumin (BSA), or ovalbumin (OVA) (Sigma) (176 mg in each case), and sodium cyanoborohydride (28.3 mg; 0.45 m) were dissolved in sodium phosphate buffer (0.2 m; pH 7.8); to this was added glyoxylic acid (14.3 mg; 0.155 m) in a total volume of 1 ml per reaction. The mixture was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Control proteins were prepared under the same conditions, except that glyoxylic acid was omitted (23Ikeda K. Higashi T. Sano H. Jinnouchi Y. Yoshida M. Araki T. Ueda S. Horiuchi S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8075-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). These published methods were modified in order to prepare proteins with a range of CML modifications as follows: protein was incubated in buffer exactly as above, except that varying amounts of glyoxylic acid were added as follows: 10 mg (0.108m), 7 mg (0.076 m), 4 mg (0.043 m), 2 mg (0.0217 m), and 1 mg (0.0108 m); concomitantly varying amounts of sodium cyanoborohydride were added as follows: 19.8 mg (0.3152 m), 14.1 mg (0.225 m), 7.1 mg (0.1125 m), 3.5 mg (0.0556 m), and 2 mg (0.0318 m), respectively, as described previously. Preparations of CML-modified proteins were extensively dialyzedversus phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and characterized by percent modification as determined both by employment of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid to determine the difference in lysine residues of modified versus unmodified preparations (42Habeeb A.F. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 14: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar) and by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (43Woo K. Chang D. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 638: 97-107Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To test CML-modified adducts, 0.8 mmol of CML/mol of Lys, CML-OVA, 33 mmol of CML/mol of Lys, were diluted 1:40 with native OVA in PBS. All CML-modified native proteins, antibodies/F(ab′)2 fragments, and control proteins were devoid of endotoxin prior to experiments by chromatography onto Detox-igel columns (Pierce). The level of endotoxin in all protein preparations (concentration range, 2–6 mg/ml) was less than 3 pg/ml (Sigma). Anti-human RAGE IgG and affinity purified anti-CML IgG were prepared and characterized as described previously (44Hori O. Brett J. Slattery T. Cao R. Zhang J. Chen J.X. Nagashima M. Lundh E.R.

In the latter case, CML-BSA and CML-KLH prepared as above were employed to immunize New Zealand White rabbits (24Schleicher E.D. Wagner E. Nerlich A.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). After 6–12 weeks, serum was obtained and IgG prepared (Pierce). Affinity purification of the IgG fractions was performed as follows: IgG fractions were chromatographed onto Affi-Gel 15 resin (Bio-Rad), which had previously adsorbed KLH. Material that did not adhere to the resin was collected and subsequently chromatographed onto Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) which had previously been adsorbed CML-BSA. After extensive washing in Tris-buffered saline (Tris, 0.02 m; pH 7.4, and NaCl, 0.1m) containing Tween 20 (0.05%), fractions were eluted in buffer containing glycine, 0.02 m; pH 2.5.A 280 nm of each fraction was determined; positive fractions were immediately neutralized and dialyzedversus Tris-buffered saline. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed to characterize the affinity purified antibodies. To wells of plastic dishes (Maxisorp, Nunc, Naperville, IL) was added 5 μg of the following proteins in bicarbonate/carbonate buffer, pH 9.6: BSA, KLH, CML-BSA, or CML-KLH. After incubation for 16 h at 4 °C, wells were washed in PBS and then unoccupied sites on the wells blocked in the presence of PBS containing BSA (1%) and goat serum (5%; Sigma) for 1 h at 25 °C. Wells were washed in PBS containing Tween 20 (0.05%) and primary antibody, and affinity purified anti-CML IgG was added at a concentration of 3 μg/ml in blocking buffer as above for 3 h at 25 °C. Wells were washed five times in PBS, and then sites of primary antibody binding were identified upon incubation with blocking buffer containing peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma) for 1 h at 25 °C. Wells were washed five times and developed in citrate buffer containingo-phenylenediamine/H2O2 as instructed (Sigma). In these assays, only CML modifications of proteins were highly reactive; no reactivity was identified versusnative, unmodified proteins. Furthermore, upon incubation of affinity purified anti-CML IgG with excess CML-BSA, immunoreactivity of CML-modified adducts was abolished. Plasma samples were obtained from human donors with diabetes, renal failure, or age-matched healthy controls in accordance with the procedures of the Institutional Review Board of Columbia University. Samples (2 ml) were dialyzed for 16 h at 4 °C in phosphate buffer, 0.02m; pH 7.1 (total volume, 4,000 ml). After dialysis, samples were subjected to filtration, 0.8 μm, and then chromatographed onto columns containing Affi-Gel blue resin (Bio-Rad) previously equilibrated in phosphate buffer, 0.02 m; pH 7.1; 5 ml of resin were employed per ml of plasma. The resin was washed in 2.5 column volumes of phosphate buffer as above, and human serum albumin was eluted by application of phosphate buffer containing NaCl (1.4m). The A 280 nm for each fraction was determined (Ultraspec Plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and positive fractions were determined by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with silver (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was performed employing the above material; to each lane of SDS-PAGE gels (8%), 30 μg of protein was added. Simultaneously, marker proteins were added as a means to assess ≈kDa (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After electrophoretic separation, contents of the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Unoccupied sites on the membranes were blocked in the presence of nonfat dry milk in TBS (13.5%) for 4 h at room temperature. Immunoblotting was performed using affinity purified anti-CML IgG as above (14.2 μg/ml) in milk buffer (5%) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Membranes were washed extensively in TBS containing Tween 20 (0.1%) and membranes incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. Membranes were washed extensively in the above buffer, and visualization of antibody binding was performed employing the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitative evaluation of band intensity was performed using Molecular Dynamics/ImageQuant (Foster City, CA). Human IgG (Sigma), 5 mg/ml in PBS, was subjected to nonenzymatic glycation by incubation in PBS containing d-ribose, 0.025 m (Sigma). The solution was sterile-filtered (0.2 μm) and then incubated at 37 °C for 6 weeks under aerobic conditions. At the end of that time, the mixture was extensively dialyzed versus PBS at 4 °C to remove unreacted ribose. This material was then chromatographed onto resin containing Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) to which had previously been adsorbed recombinant human soluble RAGE. After incubation, the resin was washed extensively with 10-column volumes of Tris-buffered saline (Tris, 0.02 m, pH 7.4; NaCl, 0.1 m) and elution of bound components performed employing glycine, 0.02 m; pH 2.5. The A 280 nm of each fraction was determined; positive fractions were immediately neutralized and dialyzed versus TBS. ELISA was performed essentially as described above employing varying concentrations of CML-BSA as standard reference. Wells of plastic dishes were coated with AGE-IgG, material eluted from the above column, and volume control (buffer retrieved after elution of RAGE-binding components subsequent to washing with 10-column volumes of glycine buffer). Primary antibody, affinity purified anti-CML IgG was employed (3 μg/ml) to identify CML-immunoreactivity in the various fractions. Finally, goat anti-rabbit IgG was added to detect sites of binding of primary antibody, and plates were developed as above.A 490 nm was detected. Human soluble recombinant RAGE was radiolabeled with 125I by incubation with IODO-BEADS (Pierce) to a specific activity of ≈4,000 to 5,000 cpm/ng protein. In all cases, after radioiodination, precipitation of the radiolabeled material in trichloroacetic acid exceeded 90%. CML modifications of proteins as indicated or native, unmodified proteins were loaded onto the wells of plastic dishes (Maxisorp, Nunc) (5 ng/well) in bicarbonate/carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. Material in the wells was aspirated, and unoccupied sites were blocked by incubation with PBS containing BSA (1%) for 2 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed twice with PBS containing octyl β-glucoside (0.005%) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A radioligand binding assay was performed in PBS containing BSA (0.2%) with the indicated concentration of 125I-human sRAGE alone or in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled human sRAGE or the indicated competitor for 2 h at 37 °C. At the end of that time, wells were washed rapidly five times with washing buffer as above; elution of bound material was performed in a solution containing heparin, 1 mg/ml. Solution was aspirated from the wells and counted in a gamma counter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equilibrium binding data were analyzed according to the equation of Klotz and Hunston (45Klotz I. Hunston D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10060-10062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar):B = nKA/1 + KA, whereB indicates specifically bound ligand (total binding, wells incubated with tracer alone, minus nonspecific binding, wells incubated with tracer in the presence of excess unlabeled material), nindicates sites/cell, K indicates the dissociation constant, and A indicates free ligand concentration) using nonlinear least squares analysis (Prism; San Diego, CA). Specific binding of CML-BSA to radiolabeled RAGE was further determined by subtraction of nonspecific binding (counts obtained upon binding of radiolabeled sRAGE to immobilized BSA) from that obtained upon binding of radiolabeled sRAGE to immobilized CML-BSA. In the case binding to immobilized BSA, counts were negligible and less than 10% that observed in the presence of CML-BSA. Where indicated, pretreatment with either antibodies, soluble RAGE, or the indicated potential competitor was performed for 2 h prior to binding assay. In certain experiments, material eluted from the RAGE-Affi-Gel 10 columns (after passage of AGE-IgG) was tested as unlabeled competitor in the binding assay; controls were performed with equal volumes of glycine buffer. In other experiments, isolated RAGE domains were employed as unlabeled competitors. Human RAGE cDNA encoding the V, C1, or C2 domain was inserted into theEcoRI site of pGEX4T vector containing GST. Fusion proteins, V-GST, C1-GST, and C2-GST, were expressed in Escehrichia coli, purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column, and cleaved with thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RAGE domains were then purified to homogeneity using glutathione-Sepharose and characterized by SDS-PAGE and amino-terminal sequencing (1Schmidt A.M. Vianna M. Gerlach M. Brett J. Ryan J. Kao J.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated and characterized as described (46Jaffe E. Nachman R. Becker C. Minick R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5968) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 96-well tissue culture-treated wells (Corning, Corning, NY) in endothelial cell growth medium (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) until achieving confluence; medium was then changed to F-12 without serum (Life Sciences) immediately prior to stimulation with the indicated concentrations of CML-ovalbumin or native ovalbumin. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with rabbit anti-human RAGE IgG, nonimmune rabbit IgG for 2 h; in certain cases, CML-OVA was pretreated with the indicated concentration of sRAGE for 1 h prior to cell stimulation. After 6 h, cells were fixed in medium containing paraformaldehyde (2%) for 10 min followed by incubation in fresh paraformaldehyde (2%) for 16 h at 4 °C. Wells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with H2O2 (0.3%) for 10 min at room temperature. Wells were again washed twice with PBS and incubated in PBS containing BSA (2%) and non-fat dry milk (4%) to block nonspecific binding sites on the cell surface for 30 min at room temperature. After washing once in PBS, cell surface ELISA employing anti-VCAM-1 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) (2 μg/ml) was performed for 2 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed four times and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed five times and sites of antibody binding detected with OPD as above; measurements ofA 490 nm per well were obtained. Assessment of functional VCAM-1 activity was determined using51Cr-labeled Molt-4 cells (ATCC) as described (14Schmidt A.M. Hori O. Chen J. Li J.F. Crandall J. Zhang J. Cao R. Yan S.D. Brett J.

Molt-4 cells, which bear cell surface RAGE, were grown in suspension in medium containing RPMI 1640, fetal bovine serum (10%), and antibiotics (Life Sciences). The lower chamber contained the chemotactic stimulus as indicated. N-Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (Sigma) was employed as positive control. Molt-4 cells were added to the upper chamber (5 × 104 cells/well). After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, nonmigrating cells on the upper surface of the membrane were gently scraped and removed; the membrane was then fixed in methanol (100%), and cells that had migrated through the membrane were stained with Giemsa (Sigma). Cells in nine high-powered fields were counted and mean ± S.E. reported. Where indicated, cells were incubated with the indicated F(ab′)2for 2 h at 37 °C prior to assay; in certain cases, CML-modified proteins were incubated with the indicated molar excesses of human soluble RAGE for 1 h at 37 °C prior to assay.

A polyphosphoinositide phosphatase, synaptojanin 1, was identified as a major presynaptic protein associated with endocytic coated intermediates. We report here that synaptojanin 1-deficient mice exhibit neurological defects and die shortly after birth. In neurons of mutant animals, PI(4,5)P2 levels are increased, and clathrin-coated vesicles accumulate in the cytomatrix-rich area that surrounds the synaptic vesicle cluster in nerve endings. In cell-free assays, reduced phosphoinositide phosphatase activity correlated with increased association of clathrin coats with liposomes. Intracellular recording in hippocampal slices revealed enhanced synaptic depression during prolonged high-frequency stimulation followed by delayed recovery. These results provide genetic evidence for a crucial role of phosphoinositide metabolism in synaptic vesicle recycling."

https://openalex.org/W2100209874,"While all known natural isolates of C. elegans contain multiple copies of the Tc1 transposon, which are active in the soma, Tc1 transposition is fully silenced in the germline of many strains. We mutagenized one such silenced strain and isolated mutants in which Tc1 had been activated in the germline (""mutators""). Interestingly, many other transposons of unrelated sequence had also become active. Most of these mutants are resistant to RNA interference (RNAi). We found one of the mutated genes, mut-7, to encode a protein with homology to RNaseD. This provides support for the notion that RNAi works by dsRNA-directed, enzymatic RNA degradation. We propose a model in which MUT-7, guided by transposon-derived dsRNA, represses transposition by degrading transposon-specific messengers, thus preventing transposase production and transposition."

We have mapped the genetic defect in several EEC syndrome families to a region of chromosome 3q27 previously implicated in the EEC-like disorder, limb mammary syndrome (LMS). Analysis of the p63 gene, a homolog of p53 located in the critical LMS/EEC interval, revealed heterozygous mutations in nine unrelated EEC families. Eight mutations result in amino acid substitutions that are predicted to abolish the DNA binding capacity of p63. The ninth is a frameshift mutation that affects the p63alpha, but not p63beta and p63gamma isotypes. Transactivation studies with these mutant p63 isotypes provide a molecular explanation for the dominant character of p63 mutations in EEC syndrome."

Understanding the mechanism of this termination requires that the precise relative timing of abrupt climate warming in the tropics versus the North Atlantic be known. Nitrogen and argon isotopes in trapped air in Greenland ice show that the Greenland Summit warmed 9 +/- 3 degrees C over a period of several decades, beginning 14,672 years ago. Atmospheric methane concentrations rose abruptly over a approximately 50-year period and began their increase 20 to 30 years after the onset of the abrupt Greenland warming. These data suggest that tropical climate became warmer or wetter (or both) approximately 20 to 80 years after the onset of Greenland warming, supporting a North Atlantic rather than a tropical trigger for the climate event."

We have identified a novel form of the AP-1 clathrin adaptor complex that contains as one of its subunits μ1B, an epithelial cell-specific homolog of the ubiquitously expressed μ1A. LLC-PK1 kidney epithelial cells do not express μ1B and missort many basolateral proteins to the apical surface. Stable expression of μ1B selectively restored basolateral targeting, improved the overall organization of LLC-PK1 monolayers, and had no effect on apical targeting. We conclude that basolateral sorting is mediated by an epithelial cell-specific version of the AP-1 complex containing μ1B."
https://openalex.org/W1987030209,"In a culture system where a bifurcated Aplysia sensory neuron makes synapses with two motor neurons, repeated application of serotonin (5-HT) to one synapse produces a CREB-mediated, synapse-specific, long-term facilitation, which can be captured at the opposite synapse by a single pulse of 5-HT. Repeated pulses of 5-HT applied to the cell body of the sensory neuron produce a CREB-dependent, cell-wide facilitation, which, unlike synapse-specific facilitation, is not associated with growth and does not persist beyond 48 hr. Persistent facilitation and synapse-specific growth can be induced by a single pulse of 5-HT applied to a peripheral synapse. Thus, the short-term process initiated by a single pulse of 5-HT serves not only to produce transient facilitation, but also to mark and stabilize any synapse of the neuron for long-term facilitation by means of a covalent mark and rapamycin-sensitive local protein synthesis."

Within minutes of peptide-specific T cells interacting with APCs, pMHCs on APCs formed clusters at the site of T cell contact. Thereafter, these clusters were acquired by T cells and internalized through T cell receptor–mediated endocytosis. During this process, T cells became sensitive to peptide-specific lysis by neighboring T cells (fratricide). This form of immunoregulation could explain the “exhaustion” of T cell responses that is induced by high viral loads and may serve to down-regulate immune responses."

Mutations in CRABS CLAW, the founding family member, display ectopic formation of adaxial carpel tissues only when the functions of other genes, such as GYMNOS or KANADI, are also compromised. Mutations in these genes alone do not result in loss of polar differentiation, and therefore, they act redundantly with CRABS CLAW to establish polarity. As GYMNOS encodes a uniformly expressed homolog of the chromatin-remodeling protein, Mi2, we argue that the unique genetic interactions do not reflect a molecular redundancy. Rather, CRABS CLAW regulates transcription spatially, whereas GYMNOS regulates downstream targets temporally to ensure proper differentiation of the carpels."
https://openalex.org/W2000709611,"Replication of DNA lesions leads to the formation of mutations. In Escherichia coli this process is regulated by the SOS stress response, and requires the mutagenesis proteins UmuC and UmuD′. Analysis of translesion replication using a recently reconstituted in vitro system (Reuven, N. B., Tomer, G., and Livneh, Z. (1998) Mol. Cell 2, 191–199) revealed that lesion bypass occurred with a UmuC fusion protein, UmuD′, RecA, and SSB in the absence of added DNA polymerase. Further analysis revealed that UmuC was a DNA polymerase (E. coli DNA polymerase V), with a weak polymerizing activity. Upon addition of UmuD′, RecA, and SSB, the UmuC DNA polymerase was greatly activated, and replicated a synthetic abasic site with great efficiency (45% bypass in 6 min), 10–100-fold higher than E. coli DNA polymerases I, II, or III holoenzyme. Analysis of bypass products revealed insertion of primarily dAMP (69%), and to a lesser degree dGMP (31%) opposite the abasic site.

These results indicate that UmuC is a UmuD′-, RecA-, and SSB-activated DNA polymerase, which is specialized for lesion bypass.

Two of these, DNA polymerase III (pol-III)1 and RecA, participate also in replication and recombination, respectively. The other two, UmuD and UmuC, are specifically required for the mutagenic reaction. It was found that UmuD is processed into a shorter form, UmuD′, which is the form active in SOS mutagenesis (reviewed in Ref.2Walker G.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 416-420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Based on in vivo and in vitro data, UmuD′ and UmuC were thought to be accessory proteins, which assist DNA polymerase III in replicating DNA lesions which usually block replication (2Walker G.C.

According to this mechanism, the mutations occur by misinsertion opposite the DNA lesion by the DNA polymerase, a result of the miscoding nature of most DNA lesions. Recently SOS mutagenesis was reconstituted with purified components in two laboratories (6Tang M. Bruck I. Eritja R. Turner J. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Moreover, it was shown that there is a qualitative difference in the specificity of bypass when translesion replication was compared in the absence or presence of SOS proteins. DNA polymerase III holoenzyme bypassed an abasic site via a misalignment mechanism, resulting in skipping over the lesion, and the formation of −1 frameshifts (7Reuven N.B. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Mol.

In contrast, in the presence of UmuC, UmuD′, RecA, SSB, and pol-III holoenzyme, the abasic site was replicated, with an A usually inserted opposite it (7Reuven N.B. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Here we report that in vitro SOS translesion replication occurs in the absence of added DNA polymerase, and that UmuC is a DNA polymerase, which is activated by UmuD′, RecA, and SSB, and performs very effective lesion bypass. UmuD′, UmuD, and the MBP-UmuC fusion protein were overexpressed and purified as described previously (7Reuven N.B. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The UmuC was further purified by heparin-Sepharose CL-6B chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A gradient of 80–1000 mm NaCl was used, and UmuC was eluted at 600 mm NaCl. TheumuC104 allele was constructed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis, introducing the 720GAT→AAT mutation (9Koch W.H. Ennis D.G. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Using plasmid pMAC as a template, the 5′-terminal portion ofumuC was amplified using the primers 5′-ATG GGG TAA ACC GGT GGT TGT-3′ (primer 338) and 5′-CTC ATT AAT ACT GTA AAT CTC-3′ (primer 342), and the 3′-terminal portion of umuC was amplified using the primers 5′-CCG GAA TTC TTT ATT TGA CCC TCA GTA AAT C-3′ (primer 131) and 5′-GTA TTA ATG AGG CAT TCT GCG-3′ (primer 341). The resulting fragments (241 and 983 bp, respectively) contained a sequence overlap of 11 nucleotides spanning the umuC104 mutation. The DNA fragments were gel-purified, mixed, and used in a final PCR step with primers 338 and 131 to construct the entire umuC104gene. The PCR product (1214 bp) was cut with AgeI andEcoRI and subcloned into pMAC, which was previously cleaved with the same nucleases. The resulting plasmid was termed pMAC104. The sequence of the umuC104 gene was verified by DNA sequence analysis. The MBP-UmuC104 protein was purified as described for MBP-UmuC. SSB and RecA were purified as described (Refs. 10Lohman T.M.

Throughout this study we used gapped plasmid GP21, which contained a site-specific synthetic (tetrahydrofuran) abasic site, and a ssDNA region of approximately 350 nucleotides (Fig. 1). The undamaged gapped plasmid (a plasmid with no base lesion) was prepared by nicking plasmid pOC2 (13Cohen-Fix O. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The site-specific nicks were converted into gaps using exonuclease III, in a reaction mixture (300 μl) containing 30 μg of FII pOC2 and 300 units of exonuclease III, for 25 min at 37 °C. The size of the gap was deduced to be approximately 350 nucleotides, based on the electrophoretic migration of the DNA after digestion of the ssDNA region with S1 nuclease. The primed and the gapped oligonucleotides were prepared as described previously (15Paz-Elizur T. Takeshita M. Goodman M. O'Donnell M. Livneh Z. J. Biol.

The gapped duplex oligonucleotide was prepared in a similar way, except that an additional oligonucleotide, 16 nucleotides long (5′-AACGCCAGGGTTTTCC-3′) was annealed to the template, such that a duplex with a 5-nucleotides ssDNA gap was formed (Fig. 3).Figure 3DNA polymerase activity of UmuC in the absence of RecA and SSB.

Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for the indicated periods of time. Analysis of the bypass products was modified as follows: prior to cleavage the reaction mixture was treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (0.2 units, 1 h, 37 °C), to hydrolyze remaining dNTPs. This step was introduced because some restriction nuclease preparations were contaminated with DNA polymerase. The DNA was then digested withAsp700 (5 units) and MspA1I (5 units) to produce radiolabeled DNA bands which were four nucleotides longer than with the original XmnI/BstXI cleavage (Fig. 1). The DNA samples were fractionated by 15% PAGE-urea, followed by phosphoimager analysis (Fuji BAS 2500). The extent of bypass was calculated by dividing the amount of bypass products by the amount of the extended primers. The specificity of bypass was determined by DNA sequence analysis of bypass products, as described previously (7Reuven N.B. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Gap-filling DNA synthesis was performed with unlabeled gapped plasmid pOC2, which contained no nucleotide lesions. The reaction mixture (25 μl) was performed under conditions similar to those of the translesion replication reaction, except that it contained 5 nm gapped plasmid pOC2, 0.1 mm each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 10 μm[α-32P]dTTP, 0.6 μm SSB, 4.2 μm RecA, 4.8 μm UmuD′, 500 nmfusion UmuC protein, and 8 units/μl of T4 DNA ligase. Reactions were incubated for 5–20 min at 37 °C, after which the reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by phosphoimaging. Primer extension assays by UmuC were performed with32P end-labeled primed oligonucleotide or gapped duplex oligonucleotide. The reaction mixture (25 μl) was similar to that of the translesion replication assay except that oligonucleotide substrates were at 55 nm. The SOS translesion replication reaction that was reconstituted in our laboratory with purified components included a gapped plasmid carrying a site-specific lesion in the ssDNA region, pol-III holoenzyme, a UmuC fusion protein, UmuD′, RecA, and SSB (7Reuven N.B. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The substrate used, termed GP21, was a gapped plasmid containing a ssDNA region of ∼350 nucleotides, a synthetic abasic site in the ssDNA region, and an internal radiolabeled phosphate in the primer terminus strand (7Reuven N.B. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8Tomer G. Reuven N.B. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14106-14111Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A portion of GP21, including the vicinity of the lesion, is shown in Fig. 1 (upper panel). Addition of a DNA polymerase led to extension of the primer up to the lesion, and when lesion bypass occurred, synthesis continued past the lesion. The analysis of replication products was done by cutting the products with restriction nucleasesMspA1I, which cuts four nucleotides upstream to the radiolabel, and Asp700, which cuts downstream to the lesion, followed by urea-PAGE (Fig. 1, upper panel). The products were then visualized by phosphoimaging. In an attempt to define the minimal requirement of this lesion bypass reaction, we examined whether all 10 subunits of pol-III holoenzyme were required for Umu-dependent translesion replication. Surprisingly, we found that translesion replication occurred in the absence of any added pol-III holoenzyme subassembly. This suggested that one of the components other than pol-III contained DNA polymerase activity. The prime candidate was UmuC because, in contrast to UmuD′ (12 kDa), it is large enough to be a DNA polymerase (48 kDa). Fig. 1shows translesion replication by the UmuC fusion protein, in the presence of UmuD′, RecA, and SSB, without added DNA polymerase. Notice that lesion bypass occurred with a UmuC concentration as low as 10 nm, arguing against the presence of a contaminating DNA polymerase in the UmuC preparation. Interestingly, initiation of replication by the UmuC polymerase was not very effective, as indicated by the amount of unextended primer (Fig. 1, lower panel). However, once polymerization started, it progressed without much inhibition at the lesion. For comparison, Fig. 1 contains reactions with DNA pol-I. As can be seen (Fig. 1, lanes 12 and13), pol-I was strongly inhibited at the abasic site, and bypass was 50-fold lower than with UmuC/UmuD′/RecA/SSB although a higher concentration of pol-I was used. These results indicate that one of the proteins, most likely UmuC, is a DNA polymerase specialized for translesion replication. The ability of the UmuC/UmuD′/RecA/SSB proteins to carry out DNA synthesis on undamaged DNA was assayed by the incorporation of radiolabeled dTTP into unlabeled gapped plasmid with no lesions. The replication products were fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by phosphoimaging. Fig. 2(lanes 13–15) shows that the UmuC/UmuD′/RecA/SSB proteins catalyze DNA synthesis on undamaged DNA. To establish the identity of the DNA polymerase, each of the components was omitted, one at a time, and DNA synthesis was examined in the same way. As can be seen in Fig.2, omission of each of RecA, SSB, or UmuD′ caused a strong reduction but not complete elimination of DNA synthesis. In contrast, omission of the UmuC fusion protein completely abolished DNA synthesis (Fig. 2, lanes 7–9). This indicates that UmuC is a DNA polymerase and that UmuD′, RecA, and SSB cause a strong stimulation of its activity. In an attempt to directly demonstrate the DNA polymerase activity of UmuC, a synthetic oligonucleotide template, 40-nucleotides long, primed with a 32P end-labeled 19-mer oligonucleotide was used as a substrate. In addition, a gapped duplex oligonucleotide was prepared, by annealing an additional 16-mer oligonucleotide to the same primer template, such that a 5-nucleotides single-stranded gap was formed (Fig. 3). As can be seen in Fig. 3, MBP-UmuC alone had a very weak DNA polymerase activity (lane 4), but it was slightly stronger on the gapped duplex (lane 9). We subjected the MBP-UmuC protein to an additional purification step on a heparin-Sepharose affinity column. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the DNA polymerase activity of this preparation was higher (lane 2), as compared with the previous preparation (lane 4). Again, activity on the gapped duplex was higher than on the primed template (Fig. 3, compare lane 7 tolane 2). Adding UmuD′ did not change the activity of UmuC (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 3, 6, and8). The ability of UmuC to bypass an abasic site was tested with the same set of oligonucleotides, which contained a synthetic abasic site in the template strand at position 20 (15Paz-Elizur T. Takeshita M. Goodman M. O'Donnell M. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24662-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It was found that UmuC alone, or together with UmuD′, were unable to bypass the lesion (data not shown). The same result was obtained with the gapped plasmid GP21 (data not shown). Therefore, although UmuC is a DNA polymerase, its remarkable lesion bypass ability depends on UmuD′, RecA, and SSB. To provide further evidence that UmuC is a DNA polymerase, the UmuC104 mutant protein was overexpressed and analyzed. This protein contains a Asp101 → Asn amino acid substitution, which renders it non-mutable by UV light in vivo (9Koch W.H. Ennis D.G. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Steinborn G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 165: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This mutation is in the SIDE motif, which is conserved among all homologues of UmuC (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar,18McDonald J.P. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1557-1568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A side-by-side comparison of translesion replication activity revealed that the mutant protein was completely defective in lesion bypass, consistent with its in vivo phenotype (Fig.4, compare lanes 2 and3 to lanes 4 and 5; and lanes 9 and 10 to lanes 11 and 12). UmuC104 also lost its ability to extend the primer (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 7 and lanes 13 and 14), indicating that Asp101 is essential for both polymerase and lesion bypass activities. The specificity of bypass by UmuC/UmuD′/RecA/SSB was examined by determining the DNA sequence of the newly synthesized bypass products. Analysis of 16 isolates revealed that A was most frequently inserted opposite the synthetic abasic site (69%, 11/16), whereas G was inserted less frequently (31%, 5/16). This specificity is in agreement with the in vivo mutagenic specificity of abasic sites (19Kunkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 20Lawrence C.W. Borden A. Banerjee S.K. LeClerc J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2153-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 21Takeshita M. Eisenberg W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1897-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition to the results presented above, it was found that: (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar) the DNA polymerase activity of the UmuC fusion protein was retained when it was purified from an E. coli strain lacking pol-II, therefore eliminating the possibility of a contamination of pol-II. (2Walker G.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 416-420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) Adding pol-I or pol-III core to translesion replication reactions did not increase lesion bypass; in fact it caused some inhibition, probably because of competition for the primer-template terminus (data not shown). Taken together these results indicate that UmuC is a lesion bypass DNA polymerase whose activity requires UmuD′, RecA, and SSB. The most striking property of the UmuC polymerase, is its remarkable ability to replicate the synthetic abasic site with high efficiency. When compared with other E. coli DNA polymerases acting on the same substrate ( Ref. 12Tomer G. Livneh Z. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5948-5958Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, and Fig. 1), UmuC/UmuD′/RecA/SSB are 50–100-fold more efficient than pol-I or pol-II in lesion bypass. Pol-III holoenzyme was only 5–10-fold less effective than UmuC/UmuD′/RecA/SSB in bypassing the synthetic abasic site, but this bypass produced exclusively frameshifts, a lethal type of mutation (7Reuven N.B. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar,8Tomer G. Reuven N.B. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14106-14111Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, UmuC/UmuD′/RecA/SSB replicated the lesion, forming primarily base substitution, a milder type of mutation. The initiation of polymerization by the UmuC DNA polymerase in the presence of UmuD′, RecA, and SSB is slow under our reaction conditions, as indicated by the amount of unextended primer termini. This might indicate that loading of the UmuC DNA polymerase on DNA may require a special factor, although at this stage we cannot exclude the possibility that the fused MBP moiety interferes with initiation. Tanget al. have reported that SOS lesion bypass required the β subunit sliding DNA clamp, and the γ complex clamp loader, which together make up for six of the accessory subunits of pol-III holoenzyme (6Tang M. Bruck I. Eritja R. Turner J. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9755-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We have previously indicated that pol-III holoenzyme was required for lesion bypass, without establishing which of the ten subunits of pol-III holoenzyme were needed (7Reuven N.B. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It is clear from the results presented here that the actual replication of the abasic site did not require any of the subunits of pol-III holoenzyme. However, pol-III holoenzyme, or at least some of its subunits, may act along with UmuC to increase the overall efficiency of translesion replication. This can occur, for example, by stimulating the initiation stage of translesion replication or by facilitating the extension of products bypassed by UmuC/UmuD′/RecA/SSB. Such possibilities might explain the in vivo requirement for pol-III in SOS mutagenesis (22Bridges B.A. Motershead R.P. Sedgwick S.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 144: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Brotcorne-Lannoye A. Maenhaut-Michel G. Radman M. Mol. Gen.

During preparation of this manuscript, Tang et al. (25Tang M. Shen X. Frank E.G. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8919-8924Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) reported that the UmuD′2C complex is a DNA polymerase and termed it DNA polymerase V. Our results generally agree with those of Tang et al. (25Tang M. Shen X. Frank E.G. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8919-8924Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) and show directly that UmuC itself is the DNA polymerase. A major difference between the two laboratories is in the protein requirements for translesion replication. In our system, lesion bypass required the UmuC fusion protein, UmuD′, RecA, and SSB, whereas Tang et al. (25Tang M. Shen X. Frank E.G. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8919-8924Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) reported that, in addition, six accessory subunits of pol-III holoenzyme, the 5-subunit γ complex (the clamp loader) and the β subunit processivity clamp, were required. This difference may stem from the differences between the two experimental systems utilized: (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar) This study used a gapped circular DNA with a site-specific lesion in the ssDNA region, whereas Tanget al. (25Tang M. Shen X. Frank E.G. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8919-8924Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) used a linear ssDNA with the lesion located 50 nucleotides from the DNA end. (2Walker G.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 416-420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) We used an MBP-UmuC fusion protein and UmuD′, whereas Tang et al. (25Tang M. Shen X. Frank E.G. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8919-8924Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) used a complex of UmuD′2C. Further experiments are needed to resolve the discrepancy in the requirement for pol-III accessory proteins in lesion bypass. The UmuC DNA polymerase is part of a novel family of DNA polymerases which function in lesion bypass. This includes the products of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae RAD30, and the humanXP-V genes, which encode DNA polymerase η (26Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L.

Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). In addition, the E. coli dinB gene was recently shown to encode a DNA polymerase (E. coli DNA polymerase IV) (28Wagner J. Gruz P. Kim S.R. Yamada M. Matsui K. Fuchs R.P.P. Nohmi T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 281-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). This gene is a umuC homologue, which functions in phage λ untargeted mutagenesis (29Brotcorne-Lannoye A. Maenhaut-Michel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

There are DNA polymerases specialized for chromosome replication, for excision repair, and now also for translesion replication."

ApoA-I contains a globular N-terminal domain (residues 1–43) and a lipid-binding C-terminal domain (residues 44–243). Here we propose a detailed model for the smallest discoidal HDL, consisting of two apoA-I molecules wrapped beltwise around a small patch of bilayer containing 160 lipid molecules. The C-terminal domain of each monomer is ringlike, a curved, planar amphipathic α helix with an average of 3.67 residues per turn, and with the hydrophobic surface curved toward the lipids.

https://openalex.org/W2053509579,"The overexpression of Bax kills cells by a mechanism that depends on induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) (Pastorino, J. G., Chen, S.-T., Tafani, M., Snyder, J. W., and Farber, J. L. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 7770–7775). In the present study, purified, recombinant Bax opened the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). Depending on its concentration, Bax had two distinct effects. At a concentration of 125 nm, Bax caused the release of the intermembranous proteins cytochrome c and adenylate kinase and the release from the matrix of sequestered calcein, effects prevented by the inhibitor of the PTP cyclosporin A (CSA). At this concentration of Bax, there was no detectable mitochondrial swelling or depolarization. These effects of low Bax concentrations are interpreted as the consequence of transient, non-synchronous activation of the PTP followed by a prompt recovery of mitochondrial integrity. By contrast, Bax concentrations between 250 nm and 1 μmcaused a sustained opening of the PTP with consequent persistent mitochondrial swelling and deenergization (the MPT). CSA prevented the MPT induced by Bax. Increasing concentrations of calcium caused a greater proportion of the mitochondria to undergo the MPT in the presence of Bax. Importantly, two known mediators of apoptosis, ceramide and GD3 ganglioside, potentiated the induction by Bax of the MPT. The data imply that Bax mediates the opening of the mitochondrial PTP with the resultant release of cytochrome c from the intermembranous space. The overexpression of Bax kills cells by a mechanism that depends on induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) (Pastorino, J. G., Chen, S.-T., Tafani, M., Snyder, J.

Nature. 1997; 385: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). By utilizing inducible expression systems, the production of Bax was shown to induce the characteristic features of apoptosis, including cell death, DNA fragmentation, and caspase activation (1Pastorino J.G.

Moreover, the overexpression of Bax resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction with the loss of the membrane potential and the release of cytochromec to the cytosol (1Pastorino J.G. Chen S.-T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), events that occur in many models of apoptosis. Our studies show that the cell death resulting from the induced overexpression of Bax was prevented by inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition with cyclosporin A (1Pastorino J.G. Chen S.-T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The MPT1 was accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, caspase-3 activation in the cytosol, cleavage of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, and DNA fragmentation, all of which were inhibited by CSA. The caspase-3 inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl–Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone had no effect on the loss of viability. These results indicated that in this model, at least, cell death and caspase activation are independent downstream consequences of the Bax-induced MPT. However, the mechanism coupling the expression of Bax and the induction of the MPT remained to be defined. Here we show that purified Bax induces the MPT in isolated mitochondria, an event that is prevented by CSA and accompanied by mitochondrial depolarization, organelle swelling, and the release of cytochrome c. At lower concentrations of Bax, mitochondrial swelling and depolarization are not detected, but cytochromec and matrix-entrapped calcein are still released, changes that are also prevented by CSA. Transient opening and closing of the PTP is the mechanism postulated to account for the effect of lower Bax concentrations. Finally, ceramide and GD3 ganglioside, two lipid messengers implicated in apoptotic signaling pathways, are shown to potentiate the ability of Bax to induce the MPT. Full-length Bax is insoluble. Thus, polymerase chain reaction was used to generate a fragment of the full-length mouse Bax cDNA that lacked the coding region for the carboxyl-terminal 19 amino acids. The resulting cDNA was inserted into the EcoRI and SmaI sites of pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The plasmid (pGEXBaxΔ19) was used to transform the protease-deficient strain of Escherichia coli, BL21. An overnight culture of bacteria was used to inoculate (1:10) 2 liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C. When the A 600 was between 0.7 and 1.0, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the bacteria were incubated for an additional 3 h. The cells were recovered by centrifugation (1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and lysed with 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The lysate was then sonicated briefly on ice and centrifuged at 28,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 8 h. The resin was washed with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The resin containing the bound GST-BaxΔ19 was incubated with 10 units of thrombin in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C with agitation. The released Bax was then purified on a MonoQ column using a linear gradient of 0.5 m NaCl, pH 5.0. The resulting eluate was concentrated in a Micron concentrator (Millipore). GST lacking the fused BaxΔ19 was subjected to the same purification as GST-BaxΔ19. The resulting protein had no effect on the mitochondrial parameters measured below, a result indicating that the action of Bax was not due to GST itself or a contaminant of the purification process. Mitochondria from rat liver were isolated in a sucrose-based medium containing 0.1 mm EGTA, 3 mm KH2PO4, 300 mmsucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2, as described previously (5Pastorino J.G. Snyder J.W. Serroni A. Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13791-13798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments examining the effect of calcium on the MPT in the presence of Bax, low calcium containing mitochondria were isolated by flushing the liver with 0.25 m sucrose and 1 mm EGTA as described (5Pastorino J.G. Snyder J.W. Serroni A. Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13791-13798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated in a KCl-based medium (150 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm KH2PO4, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4). Glutamate and malate (1 mm, Sigma) were added as respiratory substrates. Swelling was monitored at 540 nm in a Perkin-Elmer split beam spectrophotometer with all components except Bax in the reference cuvette. The percentage of swollen mitochondria was determined as described previously (6Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the MPT was induced in mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) with 150 μmCa2+ and 1 mm Pi. When swelling was complete, 1 μm CSA and 0.1 μm ruthenium red were added. An equal volume of fresh mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) was then added. The CSA and ruthenium red prevent the MPT from developing in the freshly added mitochondria. The final absorbance reading corresponds to 50% swollen mitochondria and 50% nonswollen mitochondria. By varying the percentage of swollen and nonswollen mitochondria, a calibration curve is constructed that reflects the change in absorbance as a function of the percentage of swollen mitochondria (6Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CSA was dissolved in ethanol and added to the mitochondria for a final concentration of 5 μm. In all cases mitochondria were pretreated with CSA for at least 2 min prior to the addition of other agents. C2- and C16-ceramides and GD3 ganglioside were dissolved in Me2SO and added to the mitochondria for a final concentration of 1 μm and 500 nm, respectively. Dihydroceramide and GM3 ganglioside were also dissolved in Me2SO and added to the mitochondria for a final concentration of 10 and 1 μm, respectively. Atractyloside was dissolved in Me2SO and added to the mitochondria at a final concentration of 5 μm. In all cases, the final concentration of Me2SO was 0.2%, and Me2SO alone had no effect on the parameters measured. Mitochondrial energization was measured with a TPP+-selective electrode as described (7Hoek J.B. Nicholls D.G. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1458-1464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcein was introduced into the matrix space of the mitochondria by incubating them with a 5 μm concentration of the membrane-permeant ester form, calcein-AM. The mitochondria were then washed twice with respiratory buffer. Calcein-loaded mitochondria were exposed to various conditions as outlined under “Results.” Following such treatments, the mitochondria were washed and the fluorescence measured on a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 488 nm excitation and 520 nm emission. The mitochondria were first pelleted at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and filtered through a 0.2-μm and then through a 0.1-μm Ultrafree MC filter (Millipore). Mitochondrial and supernatant fractions were normalized for protein content and separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Cytochrome c was detected by a monoclonal antibody to cytochrome c (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) as described previously (1Pastorino J.G. Chen S.-T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). As with cytochromec release the mitochondria were pelleted at 12,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and filtered through a 0.2-μm and then through a 0.1- μm Ultrafree MC filter (Millipore). Adenylate kinase activity was assayed in the supernatant spectrophotometrically at 25 °C (8Criss W.E. Litwack G. Morris H.P. Weinhouse S. Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 370-375PubMed Google Scholar, 9Criss W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6352-6356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ADP formation is coupled with phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase; and NADH oxidation was measured at 340 nm. The assay system contained 100 mm triethanolamine HCl buffer, pH 7.5; 130 mm KCl, 3.2 mm MgSO4, 3 mm ATP, 0.38 mm NADH, 0.68 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 30 units of pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase in a total volume of 3 ml. Total adenylate kinase activity in mitochondria was determined by disruption of the mitochondria with 0.5% Triton X-100. The MPT is readily detected in isolated mitochondria by the large amplitude swelling of these organelles. Swelling is assessed as the decrease in absorbance at 540 nm of the mitochondrial suspension. Fig.1, left panel, shows that the addition of recombinant Bax to respiring mitochondria induced the MPT in a concentration-dependent manner. Whereas 1 μm Bax induced the rapid and complete swelling of the mitochondrial population, 500 and 250 nm Bax induced swelling in about 70 and 40% of the organelles, respectively. The concentration dependence and time course of the effect of Bax on organelle swelling was paralleled by changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Fig. 1, right panel, shows that 1 μm Bax induced a rapid and complete loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential as measured by a release of sequestered TPP+. Similar to the effect on swelling, 500 and 250 nm Bax had intermediate effects. In parallel with the absence of swelling, 125 nm Bax had no detectable effect on mitochondrial energization as demonstrated by the inability to observe an increase in external TPP+. Fig. 1, right panel, would seemingly indicate that a rebound in the membrane potential occurred in mitochondria exposed to 500 and 250 nm Bax. Membrane potential was measured with a TPP+-sensitive electrode, and the rebound noted most likely represents a reaccumulation of the TPP+ released from depolarized mitochondria by mitochondria that are still energized. Supporting this interpretation was the fact that the addition of 10 μm of the uncoupler carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone caused a rapid depolarization of the mitochondria and a re-release of the TPP+ (Fig. 1,right panel). CSA is a potent inhibitor of induction of the MPT in isolated mitochondria (10Broekemeier K.M. Dempsey M.E. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7826-7830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 5 μm CSA completely inhibited the mitochondrial swelling and depolarization produced by 1 μm Bax (Fig. 1, left and right panels). To define further the involvement of the MPT in the Bax-induced mitochondrial alterations, use was made of atractyloside. Atr binds to the adenine nucleotide transporter, thereby stabilizing the enzyme in the configuration where the nucleotide-binding site faces the cytosol (the so-called c conformation) (11Woldegiorgis G. Yousufzai S.Y.K. Shrago E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14783-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of the MPT is facilitated by this configuration of the ANT (11Woldegiorgis G. Yousufzai S.Y.K. Shrago E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14783-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows that 5 μm Atr alone did not induce the MPT, as measured by either sustained mitochondrial swelling or loss of the membrane potential. Similarly, 125 nm Bax did not induce detectable mitochondrial swelling or depolarization (Figs. 2 and 3). However, in the presence of both 125 nm Bax and 5 μmAtr, mitochondrial swelling was as rapid and complete (Fig. 2) as with 1 μm Bax (Fig. 1, right panel). Importantly, the mitochondrial alterations produced by the combination of Atr and Bax were completely prevented by CSA (Fig. 2).Figure 3Bax induces MPT-dependent and -independent cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. Mitochondria (Mito., 0.5 mg/ml) in respiratory buffer containing 1 mm glutamate/malate at 37 °C were either left untreated or pretreated for 5 min with 5 μm CSA. Bax at the indicated concentrations was then added. After 15 min the mitochondria were pelleted. The resulting supernatant (Super.) was filtered through a 0.2-μm and then through a 0.1-μm Ultrafree Millipore membrane filter. Samples were normalized for protein content using Coomassie Blue. 25 μg of protein per lane was run in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. Cytochrome c was detected using an anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody and secondary rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase. The blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. The results are typical of 3 independent experiments utilizing 3 independent mitochondrial and Bax preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Bax produced a concentration-dependent release of cytochrome cfrom the intermitochondrial membrane space to the supernatant (Fig. 3). An almost complete release of cytochrome c was achieved with 1 μm Bax, an effect that was completely inhibited by CSA (Fig. 3). Interestingly, 125 nm Bax did induce the release of a proportion of the total cytochrome c, an effect that was still inhibited by CSA (Fig. 3), even though the same concentration did not promote detectable swelling (Fig. 1 , left panel). The release of cytochrome c was not a specific effect of Bax on the mitochondria. Adenylate kinase, another mitochondrial protein located in the intermembranous space (8Criss W.E. Litwack G. Morris H.P. Weinhouse S. Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 370-375PubMed Google Scholar, 9Criss W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6352-6356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also released by Bax. As with cytochrome c, increasing concentrations of Bax resulted in the release of greater amounts of adenylate kinase (Fig.4). 125 nm Bax released 26% of the total adenylate kinase activity. As with the release of cytochrome c, CSA inhibited the release of adenylate kinase. The release by Bax of cytochrome c (Fig. 3) and adenylate cyclase (Fig. 4) in the absence of mitochondrial swelling (Fig. 1, left panel) likely represents the transient opening and closing of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). This is indicated by the data in Fig. 5. Upon induction of the MPT, calcein preloaded into the mitochondria is lost from the matrix space (12Nieminen A.L. Saylor A.K. Tesfai S.A. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were preloaded with calcein-AM. Nonspecific esterases remove the acetoxymethyl ester group, thereby trapping the calcein (620 Da) in the mitochondrial matrix. Upon exposure to 1 μm Bax, calcein fluorescence was promptly lost from the preloaded mitochondria (Fig. 5), an effect that was again totally prevented by CSA (Fig. 5). Although it produced no detectable effects on mitochondrial swelling or membrane potential (Fig. 1), 125 nm Bax did cause a slow but steady release of calcein (Fig.5). After a 20-min exposure to 125 nm Bax, the mitochondria had lost 40% of their initial calcein fluorescence. Importantly, this effect was inhibited by CSA (Fig. 5). These data suggest that lower concentrations of Bax cause transient and non-synchronous opening and prompt closing of the PTP. At any given moment, this effect in a limited proportion of the total pool of mitochondria was not reflected in any depolarization or swelling upon observation of the entire population of these organelles. Nevertheless, transient opening and closing of the PTP was reflected in the observed accumulation of cytochrome c and calcein in the medium, as the release of these matrix constituents is irreversible. Ceramide and GD3 ganglioside have been demonstrated to mediate apoptosis (13Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 14De Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Ceramide has direct effects on the function of isolated mitochondria (15Arora A.S. Jones B.J. Patel T.C. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and GD3 ganglioside promotes mitochondrial depolarization in intact cells (14De Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6 (left panel), 1 μm C2-ceramide alone did not induce the MPT, as measured by mitochondrial swelling. However, 125 nm Bax and 1 μm C2-ceramide together rapidly induced mitochondrial swelling (Fig. 6, left panel). Both these effects were inhibited by CSA (Fig. 6, left panel). By contrast, C2-dihydroceramide, which differs from C2-ceramide in lacking only the trans double bond and does not promote apoptosis (13Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), did not potentiate induction by Bax of the MPT (Fig. 6, left panel). C16-ceramide is a longer chain, endogenous species of ceramide that also induces apoptosis (16Mathias S. Dressler K.A. Kolesnick R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10009-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 17Bourteele S. Hausser A. Doppler H. Horn-Muller J. Ropke C Schwarzmann G. Pfizenmaier K. Muller G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31245-31251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). C16-ceramide also potentiated induction of the MPT by Bax (Fig. 6, right panel), an effect that was inhibited by CSA. Diacylglycerol possesses a glycerol backbone rather than the sphingosine of ceramide and had no effect on the MPT in the presence of Bax. Finally, 500 nm GD3 ganglioside alone did not cause mitochondrial swelling. However, when added together with 125 nm Bax, prompt swelling occurred, an effect that was again inhibited by CSA (Fig. 7). Importantly, the biosynthetic precursor of GD3 ganglioside, GM3 ganglioside, had no effect on the ability of Bax to promote the MPT. The presence of Ca2+ in the mitochondrial matrix is required to enable any one of a wide variety of agents to induce the MPT in isolated mitochondria and in the intact cell (18Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Pastorino J.G. Snyder J.W. Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C676-C685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction of Ca2+ with a poorly defined binding site on the matrix side of the inner membrane is necessary for pore opening. In turn, the probability of pore opening can be manipulated by changes in the concentration of matrix Ca2+(20Nicolli A. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Igbavboa U. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Hoek J.B. Walajtys-Rode E. Wang X. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 174: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We show here that induction of the MPT by Bax is similarly regulated by Ca2+. The addition of increasing amounts of Ca2+ to low calcium mitochondria induced the MPT in an increasing fraction of the organelles (Fig. 8 A). In control mitochondria, 120 μm Ca2+ induced the MPT in 50% of the mitochondria and 160 μm in the entire population. By contrast, in the presence of 125 nm Bax, a much greater percentage of the mitochondria underwent the MPT at lower concentrations of Ca2+ (Fig. 8 B). 40 μm Ca2+ induced the MPT in less than 30% of the mitochondria in the absence of Bax and in 60% of the mitochondria in its presence. With 80 μm Ca2+ alone, the MPT occurred in 30% of the mitochondria. In the presence of Bax, the same concentration of Ca2+ induced the MPT in virtually all of the mitochondria. Ceramide alone (Fig. 8 C) had no effect on the response of the mitochondria to successively increasing concentrations of Ca2+. However, the combination of ceramide and Bax sensitized the mitochondria to Ca2+ to an even greater extent than did Bax alone. In the presence of 40 μm Ca2+, virtually all of the mitochondria underwent the MPT (Fig. 8 D). The data presented above document that Bax has a number of effects on isolated mitochondria, all of which can be ascribed to a single mechanism, namely, activation of the mitochondrial PTP. Importantly, similar consequences of the action of Bax on mitochondria can be recognized from the reports of the effects of this apoptotic protein in intact cells (1Pastorino J.G. Chen S.-T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 4Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Thus, the data of the present study relate to the mechanism of action of Bax in an intact cell, as well as under thein vitro conditions reported here. At the higher concentrations (250 nm to 1 μm), Bax caused mitochondrial swelling and deenergization with the release of pre-loaded calcein from the matrix and cytochromec and adenylate kinase from intermembranous space. Calcium ions potentiated and CSA prevented these observed effects of Bax, which are all clearly attributable to activation of the PTP with induction of the MPT. In turn, these direct effects of Bax on mitochondria in vitro are parallel to those reported previously upon the induction of Bax expression in stably transfected Jurkat T cells (1Pastorino J.G. Chen S.-T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Bax overexpression resulted in induction of the MPT with release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol, effects that were prevented by CSA. The release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol is increasingly perceived as a critical event in many models of apoptosis (23Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar, 24Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6156) Google Scholar). As a consequence of its ability to activate caspases, cytochrome c is positioned as a key factor following a mitochondrial injury in initiating the execution phase of apoptosis. A current focus of debate has been the role of the MPT in the release of cytochrome c. Induction of the MPT in isolated mitochondria upon the uptake of Ca2+ collapses the membrane potential and swells the mitochondria with the consequent release of cytochrome c(25Yang J.C. Cortopassi G.A. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1998; 24: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). At a lower concentration (125 nm), Bax caused the release of cytochrome c and adenylate kinase from the intermembranous space and calcein from the matrix, effects prevented by CSA. This release, however, was not accompanied by detectable mitochondrial swelling or deenergization. The CSA-sensitive release of adenylate kinase from the intermembranous space indicates that the effect on cytochrome c is not a specific one. The CSA-sensitive release of calcein from the mitochondrial matrix indicates that the action of the lower concentrations of Bax is not limited to an alteration of the permeability properties of the outer mitochondrial membrane but rather reflects a simultaneous change in the inner membrane as well. We would argue that there need be no mechanistic difference between cytochrome c release at low or high Bax concentrations. The apparent difference is a consequence of the detection methods. Transient and non-synchronous activation and then deactivation of the mitochondrial PTP most readily explains these effects of lower Bax concentrations. PTP opening of short duration in a limited proportion of the total pool of mitochondria causes depolarization, swelling, and release of a fraction of the total cytochrome c. Prompt closure of the PTP allows reenergization with reaccumulation of TPP+ and prevents the sustained, large amplitude swelling that denotes the more stable induction of the MPT. Reenergization is not precluded, because the release of small amounts of cytochromec does not inhibit respiration and maintenance of the membrane potential under the non-phosphorylating conditions of the present study. Indeed, depolarization followed by repolarization of individual mitochondria brought about by transient opening of the PTP has been reported in both isolated mitochondria and intact cells (26Hüser J. Rechenmacher C.E. Blatter L.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2129-2137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar,27Petronilli V. Miotto G. Canton M. Brini M. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Previous reports of the induction by Bax in vitro of cytochrome c release in the absence of mitochondrial swelling or the loss of Δψm have been interpreted as defining a mechanism of action that is independent of the PTP (28Jürgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). However, the present study suggests that the scenario whereby Bax induces transient activation of the PTP with release of cytochromec despite the maintenance of mitochondrial energization and the absence of organelle swelling can readily account for the same previous observations. Arguments against the participation of the MPT in apoptosis have emphasized that cytochrome c release in intact cells or from isolated mitochondria occurs before the onset of mitochondrial depolarization or in the absence of organelle swelling (28Jürgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 29Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4241) Google Scholar, 30Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar, 31Finucane D.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Waterhous N.J. Cotter T.G. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Our conclusion that the Bax-induced released of cytochrome cfrom isolated mitochondria can occur as a result of transient activation and deactivation of the PTP can readily explain these previous attempts to account for cytochrome c release in the absence of a demonstrable MPT. In other words, it is not necessary to invoke any mechanism other than the PTP to explain the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria in apoptosis. The present study has also found that ceramide potentiated induction of the MPT by Bax. Although it deserves emphasizing that the relevance of this observation to conditions occurring in the intact cell remains unclear, ceramide has been implicated as a mediator of the apoptosis that follows activation of death-inducing receptors (13Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). However, there is some dispute as to the time course and mechanism of ceramide production. Some studies suggest that ceramide is elevated very early after ligand binding, as a consequence of the activation of an acidic sphingomyelinase (32Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Bernardo K. Kreder D. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5916-5922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). By contrast, other studies suggest that ceramide is elevated only later during the apoptotic process, by a mechanism that is not dependent on acidic sphingomyelinase and that may involvede novo ceramide synthesis (33Xu J. Yeh C.H. Chen S. He L. Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M.T. Choi D.W. Hsu C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16521-16526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In light of the ability of ceramide to potentiate induction of the MPT by Bax (Fig. 8), it is conceivable that the late ceramide increase may help amplify any damage that the mitochondria incur early on by Bax. Indeed the precursor of ceramide, dihydroceramide, is in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (13Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). The concentrations of ceramide reported associated with mitochondria (2 nmol/mg mitochondrial protein) are in the same range as the concentration of ceramide employed here (2.5 nmol/mg mitochondrial protein). Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor treatment elevates ceramide levels in mitochondria isolated from hepatocytes (34Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Colell A. Marı́ M. Morales A. Fernández-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Indeed, upon treatment with tumor necrosis factor, the ceramide levels of hepatocyte mitochondria went up to 6 nmol/mg protein (34Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Colell A. Marı́ M. Morales A. Fernández-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). In addition, the concentration of Bax in tumor cell lines has been reported to be around 100 nm with a 10-fold increase upon exposure to stimuli that induce apoptosis (28Jürgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). Ceramide may mediate some of its effects through GD3 ganglioside. Prevention of GD3 synthesis from ceramide by inhibition of GD3 synthetase prevented Fas-induced apoptosis (14De Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In line with the ability of GD3 to potentiate Bax induction of the MPT, addition of GD3 to hematopoietic cells resulted in a disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential in a caspase-independent manner (14De Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar).

Sprouting of the major tracheal branches is stereotyped and controlled by hard-wired developmental cues. Here we show that ramification of the fine terminal branches is variable and regulated by oxygen, and that this process is controlled by a local signal or signals produced by oxygen-starved cells. We provide evidence that the critical signal is Branchless (Bnl) FGF, the same growth factor that patterns the major branches during embryogenesis. During larval life, oxygen deprivation stimulates expression of Bnl, and the secreted growth factor functions as a chemoattractant that guides new terminal branches to the expressing cells. Thus, a single growth factor is reiteratively used to pattern each level of airway branching, and the change in branch patterning results from a switch from developmental to physiological control of its expression."

Preparations of both lipid-containing and delipidated enzyme have been analyzed. The complex is organized in two major domains, a V1 and V0, with overall dimensions of 28 × 14 × 14 nm. The V1 is a more or less spherical molecule with a central cavity. The V0 has the shape of a flattened sphere or doughnut with a radius of about 100 Å. The V1 and V0 are joined by a 60-Å long and 40-Å wide central stalk, consisting of several individual protein densities. Two kinds of smaller densities are visible at the top periphery of the V1, and one of these seems to extend all the way down to the stalk domain in some averages. Images of both the lipid-containing and the delipidated complex show a 30–50-kDa protein density on the lumenal side of the complex, opposite the central stalk, centered in the ring of c subunits. A large trans-membrane mass, probably the C-terminal domain of the 100-kDa subunita, is seen at the periphery of the c subunit ring in some projections.

Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 2Finbow M.E. Harrison M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis-driven acidification of these organelles plays an important role in processes like receptor-mediated endocytosis, neurotransmitter release, protein trafficking, pH maintenance, and storage of metabolites. Early electron microscopic images (3Bowman B.J. Dschida W.J. Harris T. Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15606-15612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Taiz S.L. Taiz L. Bot.

Chem. 1992; 267: 18783-18789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show the V-ATPase complex organized in two parts, a membrane extrinsic V1 and a membrane-embedded V0, named after the related F1F0-type ATP synthase. As in F1F0, ATP hydrolysis on the membrane extrinsic domain is coupled to proton translocation across the membrane bilayer, but unlike F1F0, the vacuolar enzyme cannot utilize the potential energy of a proton gradient to synthesize ATP. The V1V0-ATPase is composed of at least 12 different subunits. The V1 contains subunits A–H with molecular weights of 73,000, 58,000, 40,000, 34,000, 33,000, 14,000, 10,000, and 50,000–57,000, and the V0 contains subunitsa, c′, c“, and d having molecular weights of 100,000, 17,000, 19,000 and 38,000, respectively. The subunit stoichiometry of the complex is A3B3CDEFxGyHz ac (1)6 c”d, giving a calculated molecular weight of approximately 840,000 (assuming one copy of subunits F, G, and H each), in good agreement with the value of 750,000 obtained from sedimentation experiments (6Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vacuolar ATPase is similar in its structure to the well characterized F1F0-ATP synthase, and it is believed that both proteins evolved from a common ancestor (7Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Dittrich P. Taiz L. Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. Manolson M.F. Poole R.J. Date T. Oshima T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6661-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 8Nelson N. Taiz L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Significant sequence similarities for the two ATPases exist for the nucleotide binding domains of the large subunits and for the proteolipids. Based on this structural similarity, it is assumed that both proteins also have a similar mechanism; however, little is known about the details of this process in the vacuolar enzyme. Biochemical studies conducted with the yeast and coated vesicle enzyme seem to confirm this idea; however, it is unclear at this point as to how far this similarity goes, considering the lack of significant sequence homology for any of the single copy “accessory” subunits of the two proteins. Whereas a high resolution structural model exists for the largest part of the F-type ATPase, there is essentially no detailed structural information available at all for the vacuolar ATPase at this point. In the present study, we have used electron microscopy and single molecule image analysis to initiate a structural analysis of the V-ATPase from clathrin-coated vesicles. Based on the images and the known subunit stoichiometry of the enzyme, a refined model of the subunit arrangement of the vacuolar ATPase complex and its functional implications are discussed. The vacuolar ATPase from clathrin-coated vesicles has been isolated in the presence or absence of added phospholipid as described (9Arai H. Berne M. Terres G. Terres H. Puopolo K. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6632-6638Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Both lipid-containing and delipidated preparations are fully active in ATP hydrolysis assays, and proton pumping activity can be restored by reconstituting the enzyme into phospholipid vesicles. The subunit composition of the preparations used for electron microscopy was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. Protein was prepared on freshly glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids and stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Images of the negatively stained V-ATPase complex were recorded on a Philips CM300 transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV under “low dose” conditions with an electron optical magnification of × 47,000. Images were recorded on Kodak SO163 plates or a Gatan 1024 × 1024 CCD camera at a defocus value of −0.576 μm. Electron micrographs were scanned on an Optronics Color Getter Plus drum scanner with a sampling rate of 18.75 μm corresponding to a step size of 4 Å on the specimen level. All subsequent image analysis steps were performed within the IMAGIC 5 software package (10van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Single molecules were selected interactively and extracted as 100 × 100 pixel images. Initial data sets were collected from 1024 × 1024 pixel CCD frames (lipid containing and delipidated enzyme). Two large data sets (from two delipidated V-ATPase preparations, 5400 and 5800 molecules, respectively) were collected from digitized electron micrographs. Only “side views” with the long axis of the molecule parallel to the carbon foil were selected. After band-pass filtering to remove high (>1 nm−1) and suppress low (<0.083 nm−1) spatial frequencies, the images were normalized and mass-centered. The centered data set was then treated by the “Alignment by Classification” procedure (11Dube P. Tavares P. Lurz R. van Heel M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), leading to a “data set” of 200 signal improved class averages. The 200 class sums were then further classified by the double self-correlation function procedure, resulting in one average, which was symmetrized along the long axis of the molecule and then used as a reference in a first direct alignment step of the whole data set. The direct alignment was iterated three times after which the data set was treated by MSA/classification to extract the most characteristic views of the complex. A subset of these initial class sums was then used as references in a multi-reference alignment (MRA) step to further improve the quality of the averages. Analysis of the second large data set was started by three rounds of direct alignment with the symmetrized sum of the first data set as a reference image, followed by MSA/classification and multi-reference alignment. Fig.1 shows typical electron micrographs of the negatively stained coated vesicle V-ATPase, purified in the presence (Fig. 1 A) and absence (Fig. 1 B) of added phospholipids. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the protein is highly monodisperse in both preparations, a prerequisite for single particle image analysis. Most of the molecules are oriented on the carbon film in the “side view” position, which is a projection perpendicular to the long axis of the complex. In an initial step, small data sets of molecules in the side view orientation for each of the lipid-containing and lipid-free enzyme have been analyzed. Fig.2 shows total averages calculated from the aligned data sets. The main difference between the two images is the appearance of the lower portion of the complex. This lower portion is ill defined in the image showing the molecule prepared in presence of phospholipids compared with the average of the delipidated enzyme (see black arrows in Fig. 2, A and B). This difference therefore identifies the lower part of the molecule as being the membrane-bound V0.Figure 2Total averages calculated from 890 lipid-containing molecules (A) and 980 of the lipid-free complexes (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The whole complex can be divided into three major domains as follows: the V1 (12 × 14 nm, top portion), the stalk domain (6 × 4 nm, middle portion), and the V0 (6.4 × 13 nm, bottom portion). The overall dimensions of the complex are 28 × 14 × 14 nm, including the 3.6 × 3.6 nm lumenal density centered in the V0, opposite the central stalk (see Fig. 2). The V1 can be described as a more or less spherical mass that seems divided into two halves by a vertical cleft or cavity running from the top of the molecule to the point where the central stalk is attached. Several smaller protein densities can be seen attached at the top of the V1 (see below). The V0 has the shape of a flattened sphere or “doughnut,” with its hole plugged by the central stalk on the cytosolic side and by the lumenal density on the extracytosolic side. Both averages from the lipid-containing and delipidated complex are very similar for the V1 and stalk domains, indicating that delipidation does not cause any major structural rearrangements in these parts of the molecule. The more defined size and shape of the lipid-free V0 leads to an overall better alignment of the entire complex as evident from the appearance of the lumenal protein density, which is much better defined in the lipid-free molecule (seewhite arrows in Fig. 2). The averages shown in Fig. 2 have been calculated from the entire data sets, which means they contain molecules with different orientations along the long axis of the complex. To analyze the delipidated complex in more detail, two data sets from two independent enzyme preparations (5,400 and 5,800 molecules, respectively) have been collected and subjected to objective alignment procedures followed by multivariate statistical analysis and classification to extract all the different projections of the V-ATPase. The 5,400 molecule data set was first mass centered and treated by alignment by classification, leading to a set of signal improved averages calculated from molecules having the same orientation “by chance.” The set of signal improved images was then treated by the double self-correlation function procedure resulting in one final average that was symmetrized along the long axis of the molecule and used as a reference in a first direct alignment step. By following this procedure, no raw image of a single enzyme molecule has to be used as initial reference for an alignment step, thus avoiding any form of bias toward potentially insignificant features of a noisy image. The direct alignment was iterated three times, and the aligned data set was treated by MSA/classification and sorted into classes of similar images. The quality of the averaged classes of images (class sums) was further improved by using such class sums as references in a “multi-reference alignment” step. Analysis of the second data set was initiated by a direct alignment with the symmetrized sum of the first data set as a reference image, followed by MSA/classification and multi-reference alignment. The analysis of the two data sets resulted in virtually identical final averages (not shown). Class sums of the first, smaller data set had a slightly better resolution, but at the same time, about 1500 molecules of the data set did not align to produce signal improved averages and were therefore removed before the final MRA. The second, slightly larger data set was of better quality in terms of particle homogeneity, and no molecules had to be discarded from this data set. Fig. 3 shows the most characteristic views of the V-ATPase obtained after the final MRA of the larger data set. All the averages show similar overall features as the total averages in Fig. 2, including the central cleft in the V1, the doughnut-shaped V0, and the 30–50-kDa lumenal density. In addition to these more or less invariant features, there are three areas of the molecule that look different in the projections depending on the orientation of the molecule along its long axis. These regions are the top periphery of the V1, the stalk domain, and the periphery of the V0. A 10–20-kDa elongated density can be seen attached at the top periphery of the V1. Depending on the orientation of the complex on the carbon film used for electron microscopy, this elongated density can be seen either on the left (Fig. 3, images 1, 2, 4, 5, and7, see black arrow in image 1) or on the right side (Fig. 3, images 3, 8, and 9, seeblack arrow in image 3). The appearance of the top part of the V1 with respect to the rest of the molecule can be most straightforwardly explained on the basis that there are not one but three of the elongated densities and that in most averages two of these overlap in projection (see white arrow inimage 4). If this were indeed the case, it would be reasonable to assume that the three copies of the 10–20-kDa density bind to either one of the large subunits, so the three copies would be attached alternatingly in the hexagonal arrangement of the A and B subunits. A 60° rotation around the long axis of the molecule would then make one of the three densities disappear on one side of the V1 and a second one appear on the other. Images 5, 6, and 9 represent such a 60° rotation. Inimage 5, the elongated density is on the left, the same side as the strong peripheral stalk protein. An intermediate projection can be seen in image 6, in which the elongated density on the left is already hidden behind the V1. At the same time, the strong peripheral stalk protein on the left is getting weaker in image 6 (see white arrow), whereas the two densities on the right, which are barely visible in image 5, are getting stronger (see black arrows). This trend is continued in image 9, in which the elongated density is now on the right and the two densities on the right of the central stalk are now clearly visible. In addition to the 10–20-kDa elongated density, a second, “knob”-like density can be seen at the periphery of the V1, always on the opposite side of the 10–20-kDa protein (see white arrowheads in images 1 and3). The fact that this smaller density is always bound opposite the 10–20-kDa density indicates that there are three copies of this density as well. The possibility that there are not three but only one copy of the elongated and knob-like proteins and that images 1 and 3 or 7 and 8are simply related by a 180° rotation around the long axis can be ruled out based on the accompanying variation of the projected densities in the stalk region described above. The preferred orientation of the complex results in the so-called “bilobed” view, in which each three of the large subunits overlap in projection leading to the central cleft or cavity seen in the total averages shown in Fig. 2. By classifying the large data set (5800 molecules) using only the image area corresponding to the V1 and sorting the data set into 36 classes, an average can be obtained which represents the so called “trilobed” view, in which each 2 large subunits are overlapping in projection (see Fig. 5, image 1). In this trilobed view, there are two of the elongated densities visible at the top of the V1 (seewhite arrowheads), consistent with above consideration. By looking at the left of the elongated densities in this image, it becomes obvious that the knob-like density described above and the elongated density belong together and that their different appearance in all the averages shown in Fig. 3 is a consequence of the predominantly bilobed orientation of the complex. The trilobed projection of the bovine brain V-ATPase shown in Fig. 5, image 1, is very similar to averages obtained for the membrane-bound V-ATPase from Clostridium fervidus (12Boekema E.J. Ubbink-Kok T. Lolkema J.S. Brisson A. Konings W.N. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 57: 267-273Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Boekema E.J. Ubbink-Kok T. Lolkema J.S. Brisson A. Konings W.N. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14291-14293Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In these membrane-bound samples, the orientation of the complex is apparently less influenced by the interaction with the carbon film, leading to a higher abundance of this projection. A possible interpretation as to what the elongated and knob-like densities are can be obtained by comparison with the related F1F0-ATP synthase. There are about 90 amino acids near the N terminus of the V-ATPase A subunit for which there is no equivalent sequence in the bacterial F-ATPase β subunit (14Zimniak L. Dittrich P. Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9102-9112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The insertion of this so-called “non-homologous region” into the mitochondrial F-ATPase β subunit occurs between conserved residues Pro-121 and Leu-133. According to the crystal structure of the mitochondrial F1-ATPase (15Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar, 16Bianchet M. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), these residues form a loop at the outer periphery of the β subunit at the interface to an α subunit on a level just above the nucleotide-binding sites. Based on the sequence homology for the nucleotide-binding subunits of the V- and F-ATPase, it is believed that the V-ATPase A and B subunits have a similar three-dimensional fold as the β and α subunits and that they form a similar hexagonal arrangement as the α3β3complex. 2A preliminary analysis of electron microscopic images of the soluble V1 domain embedded in amorphous ice show a hexagonal arrangement of six large densities around a central cavity, in support of above assumption (S. Wilkens and M. Forgac, unpublished data). The position and size of the knob-like and elongated proteins at the periphery of the V1 would therefore suggest that these densities are at least in part formed by the non-homologous inserts near the A subunit N terminus. Also part of the elongated protein could be the F or G subunits of the V1 (both 10–15 kDa based on SDS-gel electrophoresis and sequence data); however, recent stoichiometry measurements conducted with the coated vesicle enzyme indicate the presence of only a single copy of subunit F and two copies of G. 3T. Xu and Forgac, M., manuscript in preparation. A weak homology between the F-ATPase b subunit and chromaffin granule V-ATPase G subunit has been described (17Supekova L. Sbia M. Supek F. Ma Y. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to the proposal that subunit G might be part of the second stalk or stator in the V-ATPase (see below). The subunit composition of the coated vesicle V0 isac (1)6 c“d. In most images shown in Fig. 3, the V0 seems to be a rather symmetric flattened sphere with a radius of approximately 100 Å. It is generally believed that the six c subunits of the V0 form a ring-like structure in which the six 4-helix bundles of the proteolipids are arranged hexagonally around a central cavity. Such an arrangement of the proteolipids had been proposed based on electron microscopy and molecular modeling studies conducted with gap junction-like sheets from Nephros norvegicus, which are formed entirely by the V-ATPase c subunit (18Páli T. Finbow M.E. Holzenburg A. Findlay J.B. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9211-9218Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The diameter of the c subunit hexamer according to the above study was 88 Å. The slightly larger size of the V0 described here might be due to bound detergent and residual lipid and the other membrane-bound subunits, a, c”, and d. A large protein can be seen attached at the periphery of the V0 in some averages (Fig. 3, images 2, 7, 8, and9), most prominently in image 7 (see black arrow). This density has both a small lumenal and a small cytosolic domain. The cytosolic portion of this V0 subunit is connected to the central stalk via an elongated polypeptide (for a description of the stalk domain, see below). This large, peripheral V0 protein can only be the 100-kDa a subunit, since there is no other trans-membrane V0 subunit with that size. The vacuolar ATPase a subunit is a two-domain protein with a hydrophilic N-terminal half and a mostly hydrophobic C-terminal part. The C-terminal half contains 6–9 predicted trans-membrane helices, and it has been suggested that this portion of thea subunit is the homologue to the a subunit in F1F0 (19Leng X.-H. Manolson M.F. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The topology of the V0 a subunit has recently been determined for the yeast enzyme (20Leng X.-H. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The data suggest that there are nine trans-membrane α-helices in the C-terminal half of the asubunit and that the hydrophilic N-terminal portion is exposed to the cytosolic side of the membrane. Furthermore, approximately 10–15 kDa including the very C terminus are exposed to the lumenal side of the membrane, consistent with the small density seen in image 7(see small white arrowhead). A very similar arrangement of the a subunit of the related F1F0-ATP synthase had been proposed based on electron microscopic images of the F0 (21Birkenhäger R. Hoppert M. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Mayer F. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and F1F0 (22Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Not all the averages shown in Fig. 3reveal the large V0 density as clearly as image 7, but the asymmetry of the V0 (see white arrowheads in images 2, 8, and 9) indicates its presence. In the averages that do not show any asymmetry of the V0 (see e.g. image 1 in Fig. 3), the large V0 subunit might be hidden in front or behind the projection of the c subunit ring. A second possibility is that in this class of molecules, the large trans-membrane mass is dissociated from the complex as a result of the negative stain treatment. Only the analysis of ice-embedded enzyme molecules by cryoelectron microscopy, studies ongoing in our laboratory, will be able to avoid such potential break-down artifacts caused by the negative staining technique. All averages in Fig. 3 show a 30–50-kDa protein density on the lumenal side of the complex, centered in the ring of c subunits (seewhite arrow in image 2). A possible candidate for this density is the accessory polypeptide Ac45, originally described for the enzyme from chromaffin granules (23Supek F. Supekova L. Mandiyan S. Pan Y.-C. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24102-24106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary sequence of Ac45 predicts a C-terminal trans-membrane α-helix and potentialN-glycosylation sites, suggesting a lumenal orientation of the polypeptide. Although Ac45 has been found in the coated vesicle enzyme, it seems to be present in only about 50% of the enzyme molecules. It is therefore possible that part of this density is formed by the lumenal portion of the V0 a subunit C terminus (see above). According to the above-mentioned model for the arrangement of the proteolipids, the central cavity is lined with polar residues from the first α-helix of the 4-helix bundle (24Jones P.C. Harrison M.A. Kim Y.I. Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Such a polar channel most certainly could not offer any insulation against the proton gradient, so it is obvious that the central cavity of the proteolipid hexamer has to be occluded in vivo. It is possible that the above described lumenal density might have such a “sealing” function for the aqueous pore, but there must be other sealing mechanisms in the vacuolar enzyme since no homologue of Ac45 is present in the yeast vacuolar ATPase or the related F1F0-ATP synthase. Less obvious is the assignment of the stalk and collar proteins. At least 12 different subunits (not counting subunit isoforms) have been identified as being part of the coated vesicle enzyme. Eight of these (A–H) are associated with the V1 and four (a, c′, c“, and d) constitute the V0, with an overall stoichiometry of A3B3CDEFxGyHz ac (1)6 c”dfor the entire complex. Fig. 4 shows polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the coated vesicle V-ATPase. As can be seen in Fig. 4, all these subunits are present in the enzyme preparations analyzed by electron microscopy. The stalk domain is formed by the central stalk and at least three peripheral stalk proteins. Depending on the orientation of the complex, a strong density can be seen on one side of the peripheral stalk, opposite to two weaker, less well defined densities (seearrows in image 6, Fig. 3). By sorting the data set into smaller classes than the ones shown in Fig. 3, averages can be obtained in which up to 4 individual protein densities can be resolved in the central stalk domain (see Fig. 5, images 2 ,and 3). Together with the 3 peripheral densities, this makes 7 resolvable subunits or subunit domains in the V1-V0 interface. Subunits A and B form the largest portion of the V1, which leaves subunits C–H for the interface between the V1 and V0. Also part of the stalk domain is the cytosolic portion of subunit a(see above) and possibly subunit d of the V0. Although subunit d is not a trans-membrane protein, it remains attached to the V0 domain when the V1portion is dissociated from the membrane (25Zhang J. Myers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9773-9778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two isoforms of subunit H with molecular masses of 50 and 57 kDa have been identified in the coated vesicle enzyme (26Zhou Z. Peng S.-B. Crider B.P. Slaughter C. Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5878-5884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The presence of both isoforms is required for full ATP hydrolysis activity, and recent stoichiometry data (see above) indicate the presence of each one copy of the isoforms in the V-ATPase complex. Subunit G might be involved in the formation of the second stalk (see below), and subunit F (13.6 kDa) might be too small to be detectable as an individual density at this level of resolution. This leaves 7 subunits or subunit domains for the interface between V1 and V0 which are potentially resolvable as individual proteins based on their molecular masses (30–50 kDa), consistent with the number of observed densities (see above). However, only few biochemical data exist that would define the arrangement of these subunits in the V-ATPase complex and that might therefore help to interpret the two-dimensional projections of the stalk in the coated vesicle enzyme. Subunits C and E are able to form a complex in vitro (27Puopolo K. Sczekan M. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5171-5176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and for the yeast system, an interaction between subunit pairs DF and EG has been described (28Tomashek J.J. Graham L.A.

Of the accessory proteins of the V1, only subunit H is dispensable for assembly of the complex (29Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of this subunit from the assembled complex leads to an inactivation without disrupting the V1-V0 interface (30Xie X.S. Crider B.P. Ma Y.M. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating a somewhat peripheral location for the subunit. In some averages, a large, ill-defined density can be seen on the side of the large trans-membrane mass, interacting with the bottom of the V1 (seeblack arrowhead in image 9 of Fig. 3 andwhite arrowhead in image 4 of Fig. 5). The size and peripheral location would match the size of the 100-kDa subunit H heterodimer, but also the 50-kDa N-terminal portion of the V0 subunit a might be part of this density. Except for subunit H, all the other accessory polypeptides are required for a structural and functional assembly of the catalytic sector with the membrane domain. Consequently, in current models, all of these subunits are therefore placed into the stalk domain in the interface between the V1 and V0. However, at the current level of resolution in the two-dimensional projections, the few biochemical data do not help to unambiguously assign any of the stalk proteins. We are currently in the process of imaging V-ATPase complexes tagged with monoclonal antibodies against individual subunits in order to define the arrangement of these subunits in the coated vesicle enzyme. Overall, the central stalk region of the V-ATPase is much more complex than the same region in the ATP synthase due to the larger variety of single copy accessory subunits in the vacuolar enzyme. ATP hydrolysis driven proton pumping in the vacuolar ATPase is regulated by a reversible dissociation and association of catalytic sector and proton channel in vivo (31Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process has to be obviously controlled via the stalk proteins, which might be one reason for the more complicated structure of the V1-V0interface. It is generally believed that ATP hydrolysis-driven proton pumping in the related F1F0-ATP synthase involves a rotation of a domain formed by γε (Escherichia coli nomenclature) and possibly the c subunit ring relative to the static remainder of the complex formed by α3β3δab2 (32Capaldi R.A.

In this model, the two b subunits bound to the asubunit in the F0, and the δ subunit in the F1 form a second stalk or stator keeping the two active domains of the complex in the correct spatial arrangement for energy coupling to occur. This second stalk or stator has only recently been observed by electron microscopy of negatively stained samples for both the V- and F-ATPase (12Boekema E.J. Ubbink-Kok T. Lolkema J.S. Brisson A. Konings W.N. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 57: 267-273Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Boekema E.J. Ubbink-Kok T. Lolkema J.S. Brisson A. Konings W.N. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S.

Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Weak densities can be seen connecting the elongated proteins at the top of the V1 to the stalk region in some images (see small black arrows inimages 2 and 5 of Fig. 3). In some averages (e.g. image 5 in Fig. 3), the second stalk seems to emerge from the strong density at the left periphery of the central stalk, whereas in image 2 of Fig. 3, it seems to be connected to the central stalk via a weak density all the way. This difference in the appearance of the stator could be caused by a slight rotation along the long axis of the molecule, a variation in the stain distribution in the stalk area or a negative stain-induced dissociation of the peripheral subunit, but it could also mean that there are two (or even three) “second” stalks in the V-ATPase. As mentioned above, in the F-ATPase, the second stalk is formed by the δ and b subunits. In this model, the δ subunit binds at the top of the F1 molecule and interacts with the C-terminal portion of the two b subunits (38Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 39Rodgers A.J.W. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29406-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It is a possibility that in the V-ATPase, the above-mentioned non-homologous regions in the A subunit N termini could play the part of the δ subunit in the F-ATPase and that the two G subunits, possibly as a dimer, connect the A subunit inserts to the membrane domain. Although in the F1F0-ATP synthase, the second stalk clearly emerges from the membrane at the interface of the aand c subunits, the situation is different in the V-ATPase. In all the images showing a second stalk, there seems to be no clear connection of the stalk forming proteins into the membrane portion of the V0. A very similar looking picture, in which a weak density is running down on the side of the V1 to end in a subunit bound to the central stalk, not in the membrane, has been obtained for the Na+-transporting V-type ATPase fromC. fervidus (12Boekema E.J. Ubbink-Kok T. Lolkema J.S. Brisson A. Konings W.N. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 57: 267-273Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Boekema E.J. Ubbink-Kok T. Lolkema J.S. Brisson A. Konings W.N. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14291-14293Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Whether this clear difference in the appearance of the second stalk in the images of the V-versus F-type ATPase is due to staining artifacts, or a genuine structural and possibly functional difference between the two related enzymes, requires further study. Fig. 6 shows our current working model of the vacuolar ATPase based on the available biochemical data and the images presented here. In order to unambiguously define the subunit architecture in the V-ATPase, the two-dimensional projections of the protein will have to be combined to reconstruct a three-dimensional model of the complex. These studies are ongoing in our laboratory. Roderick Nakayama is gratefully acknowledged for excellent technical assistance. After submission of this manuscript, a paper was published by Boekema et al. (Nature 401, 37–38) describing electron microscopic evidence of two “second stalks” in the V-ATPase from C. fervidus. In another paper, Radermacher et al. (FEBS Lett. 453, 383–386) provide evidence for a hexagonal arrangement of the A and B subunits inthe V1 domain."

Both enzymes contain one FAD and a catalytically essential redox-active disulfide bridge per subunit (8de la Motte R.S. Wagner F.W.

Neither enzyme reacts with reduced or oxidized pyridine nucleotides and both enzymes oxidize a range of small molecular weight thiol forms (8de la Motte R.S. Wagner F.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30510-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). There are, however, significant differences in substrate specificity. Reduced glutathione appears to be the best substrate of the fungal enzyme with reduced proteins, such as RNase, being either oxidized poorly (8de la Motte R.S. Wagner F.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7363-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or not at all (13Janolino V.G. Swaisgood H.E. Milchwissenschaft. 1992; 47: 143-146Google Scholar). In contrast, a range of reduced proteins and peptides are excellent substrates of the egg white oxidase, withkcat/Km values up to 100-fold higher than glutathione (11Hoober K.L. Sheasley S.S. Gilbert H.F. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22147-22150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the egg white flavoprotein belongs to a newly recognized family of proteins (14Coppock D.L. Cina-Poppe D. Gilleran S. Genomics. 1998; 54: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) formed from the fusion of thioredoxin and ERV/ALR motifs (see later). Quiescin Q6 is the best understood member of this family and is highly induced as human fibroblasts enter reversible quiescence (14Coppock D.L. Cina-Poppe D. Gilleran S. Genomics. 1998; 54: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Coppock D.L. Kopman C. Scandalis S. Gillerman S. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 483-493PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, sequence comparisons show that the fungal sulfhydryl oxidase is a member of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductases (16Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar), appearing closely related to thioredoxin reductase and alkylhydroperoxide reductase. Our work suggests a role for sulfhydryl oxidase-like proteins in aspects of the cell cycle in fibroblasts and in the formation of the extracellular matrix. Materials and general methods were as described previously (9Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol.

Unless otherwise stated, all buffers contained 0.3 mm EDTA. The egg white sulfhydryl oxidase was obtained as described by Hoober et al. (9Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol.

Bovine sulfhydryl oxidase was partially purified from 500 ml of centrifuged semen (3,000 × g for 10 min) based on the procedure for the rat seminal vesicle enzyme (17Ostrowski M.C. Kistler W.S. Williams-Ashman H.G. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Comm. 1979; 87: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In brief, the 30–40% ammonium sulfate fraction was redissolved and dialyzed against 50 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6. The enzyme bound to a CM-52 column equilibrated with this buffer and eluted approximately midway in a linear gradient to 300 mm NaCl in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer. The yellow oxidase fraction used for Western blots was approximately 20% pure by 280/454 nm absorbance ratio and was assayed with dithiothreitol (9Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J.

The legend to Fig. 1 lists the digestion steps used for each peptide sequenced. The redox-active cysteine residues of the egg white oxidase were alkylated with a 9-fold excess of monobromobimane (18Kosower E.M. Kosower N.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) essentially as described for iodoacetamide (9Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol.

The alkylated enzyme was freed from excess bimane by ultrafiltration, and the nonredox-active disulfide bridge (9Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol.

A 2-fold molar excess of N-ethylmaleimide over total thiols was then added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h. The protein was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.7, containing 1 mm EDTA before digestion for 16 h at 37 °C with 2% w/w aliquots of LysC added at 0 and 5 h. The bimane-labeled active site peptide was detected using an HPLC diode-array detector at 390 nm. PTH-bimane-Cys elutes on gas-phase sequencing between PTH-Tyr and PTH-Pro (19Hu L. Borleske B.L.

Cell Res. 1998; 242: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The antibody was prepared in rabbits against a peptide EDPQFPKVQWPPRE (residues 494–507, underlined in Fig. 1) using a commercial vendor (Zymed Laboratories Inc.Inc., San Carlos, CA). Specificity was demonstrated by preincubating the purified antibody (2.5 μg/ml) with the peptide (4 μg/ml) for 1 h on ice in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) with 1% milk (w/v). Blots were incubated with antibody overnight at 4 °C, washed 3 times for 5 min in TBST, incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; diluted 1/1,000), and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Molecular weights were determined using Rainbow high molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pure egg white oxidase (9Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3211-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was digested by trypsin, LysC, and cyanogen bromide methods, applied singly or in combination (see legend to Fig. 1 and “Experimental Procedures”). A total of 13 random peptides and an active site peptide (see later) were purified by HPLC and evaluated by MALDI-TOF and gas-phase sequencing. The sequence of each peptide was used to search the protein data bases and all but one (see legend to Fig. 1) show high levels of identity (from 45 to 100%) with Quiescin Q6 (Ref.14Coppock D.L. Cina-Poppe D. Gilleran S. Genomics. 1998; 54: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar and see later). The 13 of 14 peptides are numbered in Fig. 1. Fortuitously, 3 peptides (11Hoober K.L.

Milchwissenschaft. 1992; 47: 143-146Google Scholar) are found to comprise a contiguous 51-residue segment toward the C terminus of Q6. Peptide 10 contains the redox-active disulfide bridge in this flavoprotein. It was obtained by first converting the oxidase to the 4-electron reduced state by dithionite titration (9Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30510-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The dithiol was then alkylated under anaerobic conditions with monobromobimane (18Kosower E.M. Kosower N.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Under these conditions, both active site cysteine residues are labeled, as observed with iodoacetamide (9Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30510-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), yielding a strongly fluorescent peptide modified at Cys-450 and Cys-453 (Q6 numbering). The egg white oxidase contains a total of about 595 amino acids (9Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30510-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), similar to the 582 residues of Q6 (14Coppock D.L. Cina-Poppe D. Gilleran S. Genomics. 1998; 54: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In aggregate, the oxidase peptides shown in Fig. 1 represent 32% of the total sequence with an average identity of 64% (81% similarity). The probability that this degree of sequence identity would arise by chance is negligible. Thus, a sulfhydryl oxidase secreted into the egg white of the laying hen has clear homology to a protein involved in growth regulation in human fibroblast cells (14Coppock D.L. Cina-Poppe D. Gilleran S. Genomics. 1998; 54: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Coppock D.L. Kopman C. Scandalis S. Gillerman S. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 483-493PubMed Google Scholar). This conclusion is strengthened by the demonstration that the egg white oxidase strongly cross-reacts (Fig. 2) with a peptide antibody raised against a peptide comprising residues 494–507 of Q6 (underlined in Fig. 1). This reaction is completely blocked by the addition of competing peptide (Fig. 2). We have also partially purified sulfhydryl oxidase from bovine semen (see “Experimental Procedures”), based on the early work of Ostrowskiet al. (17Ostrowski M.C. Kistler W.S. Williams-Ashman H.G. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Comm. 1979; 87: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) on the rat seminal vesicle enzyme. This oxidase also contains FAD (6Ostrowski M.C. Kistler W.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30510-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows a strong specific response to the bovine enzyme. Thus, both vertebrate sulfhydryl oxidases appear related to Quiescin Q6. The differing apparent molecular weights in Fig. 2 may reflect varying carbohydrate contents (9Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30510-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The sequence of a third sulfhydryl oxidase, that from A. niger (8de la Motte R.S. Wagner F.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7363-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), is available from the patent literature (12Maat J. Muster W. Stam H. Schaap P.J. Vonderwoort P.J.v.d. Visser J. Verbakel J.M. U. S. Patent 5529926. Unilever Patent Holdings BV, The Netherlands, United StatesJune 25, 1996: 22147-22150Google Scholar). Despite markedly similar properties to the egg white protein mentioned earlier, there is undetectable sequence homology between them (not shown). However, data base searches with the A. niger sequence show 30% identity (46% similarity) with alkyl hydroperoxide reductase fromBacillus halodurans, 23% identity (40% similarity) with thioredoxin reductase (TRX B) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and convincing homology with several other members of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family (16Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). This similarity was previously predicted (16Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar): divergent evolution of a sulfhydryl oxidase from this enzyme family could easily be envisaged with the loss of a pyridine-nucleotide binding site and substitution of molecular oxygen as electron acceptor. The sequence of the egg white oxidase reflects a distinctly different lineage. Using the Q6 sequence, no members of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family appear in any search protocols (not shown). However, these searches reveal that the egg white oxidase, like Q6 (14Coppock D.L. Cina-Poppe D. Gilleran S. Genomics. 1998; 54: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), was probably formed via fusion of at least two domains. First, a single thioredoxin motif is evident from residues ∼35–125 in Q6. Thioredoxins are small proteins of approximately 95–110 amino acids with a range of redox and nonredox roles (21Ferrari D.M. Soling H.-D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 22Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A conspicuous member of the thioredoxin superfamily is mammalian protein-disulfide isomerase (21Ferrari D.M. Soling H.-D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 23Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29399-29402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 24Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The role of PDI in shuffling disulfide bonds during the maturation of proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum has been extensively documented (21Ferrari D.M. Soling H.-D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 23Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29399-29402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 24Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). PDI contains two functional thioredoxin domains with the active site sequence WCGHC (21Ferrari D.M. Soling H.-D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 24Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Our peptide sequencing of sulfhydryl oxidase has yet to encounter this sequence, although it is observed between residues 69 and 73 in Q6 (Fig. 1) (14Coppock D.L. Cina-Poppe D. Gilleran S. Genomics. 1998; 54: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the redox-active disulfide in the oxidase (9Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30510-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar) lies toward the C terminus within the second recognizable feature: the ERV/ALR motif (residues 406–503 of Q6; Fig. 1). ERV1 was the first identified member of an emerging gene family involved in the yeast cell cycle and in the biogenesis of mitochondria (25Lisowsky T. Stein G. Yeast. 1998; 14: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The homologous mammalian counterpart, ALR1 is a 125 amino acid protein that has been implicated in a range of cell development processes from spermatogenesis to the regeneration of liver tissue (25Lisowsky T. Stein G. Yeast. 1998; 14: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Hagiya M. Francavilla A. Polimeno L. Ihara I. Sakai H. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Porter K.A. Starzl T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8142-8146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although its precise physiological role is not known, ALR appears to be secreted from hepatocytes in an active form in response to liver damage (27Gandhi C.R. Kuddus R. Subbotin V.M. Prelich J. Murase N. Rao A.S. Nalesnik M.A. Watkins S.C. DeLeo A. Trucco M. Starzl T.E. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1435-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Quiescin Q6 homologs containing both thioredoxin and ERV motifs are not found in any prokaryote genome sequence or in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They are, however, widely distributed in metazoans (e.g. Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, guinea pig). In humans, sequences similar to Q6 have been named bone-derived growth factor (GenBankTML42379) and cell growth inhibitory factor (GenBankTME12644). All these homologs and the ERV proteins contain a region homologous to the active site disulfide bridge of the egg white sulfhydryl oxidase. Fig.3 illustrates this homology with representative examples. These studies suggest that Quiescin Q6 is a flavoprotein sulfhydryl oxidase. Indeed, immunoprecipitates of fibroblast cell extracts show detectable sulfhydryl oxidase activity. 2K. L. Hoober, C. Thorpe, and D. L. Coppock, unpublished observations. Quiescin Q6 does not apparently contain the ADP-binding motif (28Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) found in a number of FAD-linked flavoproteins including the A. niger sulfhydryl oxidase (not shown). However, searching the Q6 sequence using the program eMOTIF (29Nevill-Manning C.G. Wu T.D. Brutlag D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5865-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) identifies the region 442–451 (Fig. 1) as a pattern found in the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) superfamily of flavoproteins (30Correll C.C. Ludwig M.L. Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2112-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) with a stringency of at least one in 107. Cytochrome P450 reductase and nitric-oxide synthase contain an FNR domain. It is of interest that this 442–451 region is contiguous with the active site disulfide loop (residues 450–453; Q6 numbering; see earlier). Obviously, the ultimate significance of these observations must await a crystal structure of the egg white enzyme. Although the precise functions of Q6 and its homologs must await further work, there are a number of observations suggesting a connection with the extracellular matrix (14Coppock D.L. Cina-Poppe D. Gilleran S. Genomics. 1998; 54: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Coppock D.L. Kopman C. Scandalis S. Gillerman S. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 483-493PubMed Google Scholar). Q6 lacks the endoplasmic reticulum retention signal and is secreted into the fibroblast culture medium. 3D. L. Coppock, unpublished observations.In addition, a number of the genes expressed at the onset of reversible quiescence, including 4 collagens and decorin, are well known components of the extracellular matrix. These secreted proteins typically contain multiple disulfide bridges essential for structural integrity. Taking one example, disulfide bond formation in many collagens is required to direct the assembly of trimeric pro-proteins and, in some cases, is involved in the generation of extracellular collagen networks (31McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 32Gunwar S. Ballester F. Noelken M.E. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). If the specificity of Quiescin Q6 were as broad as the egg white protein (11Hoober K.L. Sheasley S.S. Gilbert H.F. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22147-22150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), Q6 might contribute to disulfide bond formation in a variety of secreted proteins. In summary, the egg white oxidase has multiple homologs in multicellular organisms. Apart from the rat seminal vesicle enzyme, none of these proteins have been assigned an enzymatic function. It now appears likely that some will be involved in extracellular matrix formation as outlined above. Finally, the A. nigersulfhydryl oxidase and this new sulfhydryl oxidase-like protein family appear to have evolved convergently. Our current work is aimed at the cloning, overexpression, and characterization of Quiescin Q6, and a comparison of its properties with those of sulfhydryl oxidases from egg white and seminal vesicle. We are also exploring the role of the thioredoxin motif in these flavin-dependent oxidases. We thank Hal White for insightful comments, Robert Alphin for maintaining the strain of chickens used for this study, Yu-Chu Huang for peptide sequencing, and Carissa Rogers for Western blotting."

In this study, we investigated which purinoceptors are present in native pancreatic ducts and how they regulate ion transport. We applied whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, intracellular Ca2+ and pH measurements, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The data show two types of purinoceptors and cellular responses. UTP and ATP produced large Ca2+ transients, a decrease in intracellular pH, 8–10-mV depolarization of the membrane voltage, and a decrease in the whole-cell conductance. The membrane effects were due to closure of K+ channels, as confirmed by dependence on extracellular K+. UTP/ATP effects could be associated with P2Y2 purinoceptors, and RT-PCR revealed mRNAs for P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptors.

These effects were dependent on extracellular Na+, not Cl−, indicating opening of cation channels associated with P2X7purinoceptors. RT-PCR showed mRNAs for P2X7 and P2X4 receptors. In microperfused ducts, luminal (but not basolateral) ATP caused large depolarizations of membrane voltages recorded with microelectrodes, consistent with luminal localization of P2X7 receptors. Thus, P2Y2 (and possibly P2Y4) purinoceptors inhibit K+ channels and may not support secretion in native ducts.

Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). They act through specific P2 receptors, which, according to their molecular structure and signal transduction, have been divided into two distinct receptor families: G protein-coupled receptors (P2Y receptors) and ligand-gated ion channels (P2X receptors) (1Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). In epithelia cultured from upper respiratory airways, intestine, and exocrine glands, including pancreas, UTP and ATP stimulate Cl− transport through P2Y receptors, which were described pharmacologically as P2U receptors and, in many cases, may correspond to the cloned P2Y2 receptors (2Chan H.C.

However, similar action of pyrimidines on Cl− transport could also be exerted through P2Y4 or P2Y6 (12Inoue C.N. Woo J.S. Schwiebert E.M. Morita T. Hanaoka K. Guggino S.E. Guggino W.B. Am. J.

Due to their effects on Cl− transport, nucleotides were proposed as therapeutic agents for treatment of cystic fibrosis, as they could bypass the defective function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator Cl− conductance and restore secretion by activation of a Ca2+-dependent Cl− conductance (8Parr C.E. Sullivan D.M. Paradiso A.M. Lazarowski E.R. Burch L.H. Olsen J.C. Erb L. Weisman G. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies on exocrine glands indicate that the P2Y receptors and associated signal transduction pathways are not static, but dynamic. For example, the P2Y2 receptor expression increases dramatically in tissue culture of salivary gland cells (14Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Camden J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1100-C1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the P2Y1 receptor activity changes during the gland development (15Park M.K. Garrad R.C. Weisman G.A. Turner J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1388-C1393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to consider which P2 receptors are present in freshly prepared cells from exocrine glands. Although there is evidence for some P2Y-type receptors (4Lee M.G. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32951-32955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Zeng W.

Occupation of these purinoceptors leads to stimulation of Cl− transport, volume changes, and secretion of enzymes and peptides (19McMillian M.K. Soltoff S.P. Lechleiter J.D. Cantley L.C. Talamo B.R.

Shoemaker D.D. Ryan M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1472-C1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jørgensen T.D. Gromada J. Tritsaris K. Nauntofte B. Dissing S. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These receptors have been described pharmacologically as P2Z receptors, but it is unclear if these correspond to the pore-forming P2X7 receptors originally found in immunoreactive cells (1Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in situhybridization analysis shows P2X4 receptors on salivary gland acini, but not on ducts (27Buell G. Lewis C. Collo G. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Thus, from pharmacological studies, it seems that exocrine glands can express receptors belonging to P2X and P2Y families, but their identity, localization, and function are unclear. Pancreatic ducts modify enzyme- and Cl−-rich secretion originating from acini by adding a bicarbonate-rich fluid. Bicarbonate secretion is achieved by coupling of ion transport through the luminal cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator Cl−channels and the luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (28Gray M.A. Greenwell J.R.

The driving force for the Cl− exit is kept by the K+ exit via the basolateral K+ channels (29Novak I. Greger R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Greger R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1991; 419: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The main regulators of pancreatic bicarbonate secretion are secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline (30Novak I. Pahl C. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 425: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 34Novak I. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 1-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Pahl C. Novak I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 424: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In earlier studies, we showed that isolated ducts also respond to ATP by releasing stored Ca2+ and initiating Ca2+ influx through channels different from those used by acetylcholine (36Christoffersen B.C. Hug M.J. Novak I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Hug M. Pahl C. Novak I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that ATP inhibits secretin-evoked changes in the membrane voltage (37Hug M. Pahl C. Novak I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 426: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We used Ca2+ signals and pharmacological profiles to describe two types of receptors: one responding to UTP and ATP and belonging to the P2Y superfamily (P2Y2-like receptor) and another responding to BzATP1 and ATP and belonging to the P2X superfamily (P2X7-like receptor) (36Christoffersen B.C. Hug M.J. Novak I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although epithelial P2 receptors are associated with Ca2+ signaling in ducts, it is not clear how this is further translated into ion transport and thus secretion in native pancreatic ducts. Therefore, the aim of this study was to use the patch-clamp methods and intracellular Ca2+ measurements to elucidate how purinergic receptors regulate ion transport in pancreatic ducts. Furthermore, we aimed at identifying these purinoceptors using molecular biological methods, which were applied to this epithelium for the first time. For this purpose, we used pancreatic duct fragments prepared from collagenase digests of whole rat pancreas. The advantage of this preparation is that we can obtain pure duct cells free of the surrounding connective tissue, blood vessels, and nerves, all likely purinoceptor contaminants. These ducts retain receptors, Ca2+ signals, and electrophysiological responses comparable to the microdissected ducts (29Novak I. Greger R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

The disadvantage of the preparation is that ducts are too fragile for microperfusion; and thus, the polarity of the responses cannot be studied. In this study, we show that UTP/ATP inhibit K+ channels and thus most likely cannot support secretion. On the other hand, BzATP stimulates cation conductance and may therefore regulate secretory processes stimulated by other secretagogues. RT-PCR analysis revealed that ducts contain mRNAs for P2Y2 and P2X7receptors, likely candidates for the observed effects, as well as mRNAs for P2Y4 and P2X4 receptors. All standard chemicals including collagenase V, trypsin inhibitor, UTP, ATP, and BzATP were obtained from Sigma (Copenhagen, Denmark). Fura-2/AM and BCECF/AM were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Leiden, The Netherlands). Tissue culture media and primers for PCR were provided by Life Technologies, Inc. Female Wistar rats (100–200 g), kept on a standard laboratory diet, were killed by cervical dislocation. The pancreas was excised and subjected to collagenase digestion as described previously (39Novak I. Hug M.J. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 5: 344-352Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pancreas was cut into small pieces and incubated with collagenase V (1.3 mg/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium 1000/Ham's F-12 mixture containing trypsin inhibitor (0.17 mg/ml). Pancreatic ducts compose <5% of the total pancreatic tissue, and single intercalated and small intralobular duct fragments (outer diameter of 10–40 μm and length of 100–200 μm) were identified with the aid of a dissection microscope. Any remaining loose connective tissue and small blood vessels were stripped with sharpened forceps. Subsequently, ducts were transferred into a chamber placed on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100TV (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) or DM IRBE (Leica Inc.)) and inspected with 40× or 63× objectives for “cleanliness.” Fig. 1 shows an example of small intralobular ducts obtained using these methods. These “clean” ducts were used for patch-clamp experiments, for molecular biology, and for most fluorescence measurements. For physiological experiments, suction pipettes held ducts on a side such that both the luminal and basolateral sides of the epithelium were accessible to the bathing solutions. For one series of experiments, small intralobular and extralobular ducts (outer diameter of 20–50 μm) were microdissected from fresh rat pancreas. These microdissected ducts were held between concentric pipettes at each end, and the lumen was perfused according to methods described earlier (32Novak I. Greger R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1988; 411: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Such ducts were used for microelectrode recordings. During all physiological experiments, the chamber was continuously perfused at a rate of 10–15 ml/min to avoid mechanical disturbances, which can cause release of ATP. 2C. E. Neumann and I. Novak, unpublished observations. Control solutions contained 145 mm Na+, 3.6 mmK+, 1.5 mm Ca2+, 1 mmMg2+, 125 mm Cl−, 25 mm HCO3−, 2 mmphosphate, and 5 mm glucose. The pH was equilibrated to 7.4 with 5% CO2 in O2. The temperature was kept constant at 37 °C during all experiments. In some experiments, K+, Na+, or Cl− concentrations were modified as follows: K+ was increased from 3.6 to 20, 25, or 50 mm by equimolar substitution for Na+; Na+ was decreased from 145 to 5 mm and substituted with N-methyl-d-glucamine; and Cl− was decreased from 125 to 5 mm and substituted with gluconate. The pancreatic ducts were stimulated with ATP, UTP, and BzATP in concentrations of 0.1 mm. In a few experiments, concentrations of agonists were varied from 10−8 to 10−3m, except for BzATP, which was not used at concentrations higher than 0.1 mm due to the cost. The cell responses to nucleotides were monitored in whole-cell nystatin patch-clamp recordings adopted for pancreatic ducts (39Novak I. Hug M.J. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 5: 344-352Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes had resistances of 3–5 megaohms, and the initial seal was at least 1 gigaohm. The success rate of obtaining seals was <10%, and stable cell membrane voltage recordings were obtained only in a fraction of these. The cell membrane under the pipette was permeabilized to make direct electrical access to duct cells. Nystatin (0.02–0.1 mm) was dissolved in a pipette solution adjusted to pH 7.2 that had the following composition: 11 mm Na+, 125 mm K+, 32 mm Cl−, 96 mm gluconate, 1 mm Mg2+, 6 mm phosphate, and 5 mm glucose; and Ca2+ was adjusted to 0.1 μm with EGTA. A flowing 1 m KCl electrode was used as a reference. The membrane voltage (Vm) was continuously monitored during experiments in a current-clamp mode (zero current clamp). Periodically, the whole-cell current (I) was measured in a voltage-clamp mode, where the voltage was first clamped to the spontaneous cell voltage and then in increasing and decreasing 10-mV steps of 500-ms duration. In some experiments, Vm was clamped at the spontaneous cell voltage, and continuous whole-cell currents were measured. Where possible, the total conductance (Gt) was corrected for the series resistance to obtain the cell membrane conductance. The series resistance was estimated by the compensation circuit of the patch-clamp amplifier (EPC 9, Heka, Lambrecht, Germany), and in some cases where this was not possible, series resistance and cell membrane conductance estimations were made subsequently by fitting an exponential function to the initial part of the current trace (40Ogden D.C. Stanfield P.R. Ogden D. Microelectrode Techniques. Company of Biologists Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom1994: 63-81Google Scholar). Since duct cells can be variably coupled to each other, Gt changes with the agonists are relative rather than absolute. In several experiments, ducts were microdissected and microperfused according to methods described earlier (32Novak I. Greger R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1988; 411: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Single duct cells were impaled with 100–200-megaohm Ling-Gerard microelectrodes, and Vm was recorded with a WPI electrometer. The fura-2 method was used to estimate [Ca2+]i in pancreatic ducts. Briefly, as we have described earlier (37Hug M. Pahl C. Novak I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 426: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), ducts were loaded with 0.5–1.0 μm fura-2/AM, and the fluorescence intensity of 10–20 cells was measured with a photomultipler at 510 nm after excitation at 340, 360, and 380 nm. The fluorescence ratio (340/380 nm) was an estimate of [Ca2+]i. Signals were calibratedin situ with ionomycin (1.0–5.0 μm). For pHi measurements, ducts were loaded with BCECF/AM as described earlier (41Novak I. Hug M. Greger R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Comp. Physiol. 1997; 118: 409-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Emission intensity of duct cells was measured at 510 nm after excitation at 490 and 440 nm. The fluorescence ratio (490/440 nm) was an estimate of pHi. Signals were calibrated in situ with the protonophore carbonyl cyanidep-chlorophenylhydrazone or nigericin (1 or 10 μm). Physiological data are presented as original recordings, summaries, and means ± S.E. In most experiments, control and test measurements were made within one duct cell or one duct, and n refers to measurements on different ducts. The paired Student's t test was applied, and p< 0.05 was accepted as significant. The F-test was used to test for the difference between two regression coefficients obtained for the current-voltage relations. Total RNA was isolated from small pancreatic ducts (prepared from collagenase digests of rat pancreas) (Fig. 1) using total RNA isolation reagent (Advanced Biotechnologies Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized utilizing an anchored oligo(dT) primer using Reverse-iT (Advanced Biotechnologies Ltd.). PCR conditions were identical for all primers (Table I). 2 μl of reverse-transcribed RNA was added to a solution of 10 μmeach forward and reverse primers, 1.5 mm MgCl2, PCR buffer (7.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 20 mm(NH4)2SO4, and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20), 0.5 mm dNTPs, 1.25 units of Red Hot DNA polymerase (all from Advanced Biotechnologies Ltd.), and distilled H2O in a total volume of 50 μl. Temperature cycling proceeded as follows: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 5 min and 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 90 s, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were then subjected to gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Possible contamination of blood vessels and acinar cells was ruled out by RT-PCR amplification of thrombin and amylase using two specific primers (Table I). Thrombin is present in endothelial cells, but not duct cells; and similarly, amylase is present in acinar cells, but not duct cells. As a positive control for duct cells, carbonic anhydrase II primers were used. As tissue controls, we used blood vessels obtained from collagenase digests of pancreas as well as the whole pancreas and testis.Table IPrimers used for RT-PCR on total RNA from pancreatic ducts The following primers were used in RT-PCR on total RNA from pancreatic duct cells.Expected sizebpabp, base pairs; Fwd, forward; Rev, reversed.Control primersRat carbonic anhydrase II Fwd5′ GGGATACAGCAAGAGCAACG-3′541 Rev5′ CAGGAAGAAGGGAGCAAGG-3′Rat thrombin Fwd5′ GCCTATTTTGCTTACCTCC-3′278 Rev5′ CACTTTCCAACCTTTTCTTC-3′Rat amylase Fwd5′ ATATTGCCAAGGAATGTGAGCGGTA-3′971 Rev5′ CTGGAAATTTCTTGTCCTTCGGTAA-3′P2X receptor primersRat P2X1 Fwd5′ ATGTCTTCCCAGCACACG-3′584 Rev5′ GTTCTTCTCCCCATACAGTCC-3′Rat P2X2 Fwd5′ GTTCACAGCTCTACCTGC-3′405 Rev5′ GATGACTCCAATGACACC-3′Rat P2X3 Fwd5′ TTCTTCACCTACGAGACTACC-3′650 Rev5′ TTAACCACATCCCCTACC-3′Rat P2X4 Fwd5′ AGGGCTACCAGGAAACGGAC-3′550 Rev5′ GATTGTGCCAAGACGGAATA-3′Rat P2X5 Fwd5′ ATCTCTACTGTCCCATCTTCC-3′595 Rev5′ TTGCTATTCTGCTTCCTCC-3′Rat P2X6 Fwd6′ TAACCAACTTCCTTGTGACACC-3′552 Rev5′ TGAAATTGTACCCCCTCTCC-3′Rat P2X7 Fwd5′ ACGAAGTTAGTACACGGCAT-3′360 Rev5′ GGCCCGGGAAGTCGATATTG-3′P2Y receptor primersHuman P2Y1 Fwd5′ CATCACCTGTTACGACACC-3′406 Rev5′ TCTCCTTCTGAAAGTATCTCC-3′Rat P2Y2 Fwd5′ TGCCGCTATGCCCGCCGAG-3′632 Rev5′ GAGTCATCACTGCTGATCGA-3′Rat P2Y4 Fwd5′ ATGGACTCATGGCCCGGCGA-3′401 Rev5′ CTTGGTGGGTGTCCGCCCAC-3′Human P2Y6 Fwd5′ TGACCCGCACGGCCGTGTAC-3′214 Rev5′ CCGGCGGCCCCCACGTTTGT-3′ Rev5′ CTTGGTGGGTGTCCGCCCAC-3′a bp, base pairs; Fwd, forward; Rev, reversed. Open table in a new tab Fig.2 A shows the effect of extracellular ATP and BzATP (0.1 mm) on [Ca2+]i in pancreatic ducts. ATP stimulation, similar to that of acetylcholine, evokes a characteristic biphasic Ca2+ response consisting of a Ca2+ peak and a Ca2+ plateau. The peak response is largely due to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, whereas the plateau reflects largely influx of Ca2+ from extracellular medium (36Christoffersen B.C. Hug M.J. Novak I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 38Hug M. Pahl C. Novak I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). UTP evoked a similar response, but a more pronounced Ca2+ influx component. On the other hand, stimulation with BzATP led to a monophasic Ca2+ response, which was almost fully dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and thus due to Ca2+ influx. On the basis of these and other observations, we postulated that there are at least two types of receptors belonging to both P2Y and P2X families (36Christoffersen B.C. Hug M.J. Novak I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B summarizes the maximal Ca2+ responses for the three purinergic analogues used in this study. The EC50 values for UTP, ATP, and BzATP were estimated at 5, 4, and ∼20 μm, respectively. ATP, UTP, and BzATP were the best agonists regarding the intracellular Ca2+ signals compared with ITP, 2-methylthio-ATP, β,γ-methylene-ATP, and adenosine, as shown earlier (36Christoffersen B.C. Hug M.J. Novak I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since native pancreatic ducts are not suitable for extensive electrophysiological experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”), we focused on using ATP, UTP, and BzATP as pharmacological markers for further patch-clamp experiments aimed at elucidating how purinoceptors couple to ion transport. In contrast to the Ca2+ responses evoked by UTP and ATP, the Vm responses measured in whole-cell patch-clamp experiments were relatively small, although there was some variability between cells. On average, UTP and ATP evoked ∼10-mV changes in Vm, and in several cells, the effects were very small, as shown in an original recording in Fig.3 A. In contrast, BzATP depolarized Vm reversibly by ∼20 mV in the same cell. Fig.3 B shows a whole-cell current measurement in another duct cell, where again the ATP and UTP responses were small, whereas BzATP stimulated a sustained inward current of ∼100 pA at a holding potential of −60 mV. In this experiment, carried out in a current-clamp mode, ATP depolarized Vm by 9 mV, and UTP by 4 mV (not shown). Similar paired experiments were performed on 14 ducts, and Fig. 4 A shows the summary of the Vm data for the three agonists. The summary shows that UTP and ATP caused small but significant Vm depolarizations of 8 ± 2 and 10 ± 2 mV, respectively. BzATP depolarized Vm by 22 ± 3 mV in the same experiments, and this effect was significantly larger compared with the UTP and ATP responses (p < 0.005).Figure 4Nucleotides depolarize membrane voltage but have different effects on the total conductance. The effects of nucleotides on Vm and Gt are summarized for 13–14 experiments. Protocols are the same as described in the legend of Fig. 3; and in most cases, all three nucleotides were tested on each duct. A, individual experiments are depicted in theupper panel showing control values for Vm just prior to and after the application of nucleotides and the Vm values with UTP, ATP, and BzATP (0.1 mm). The mean Vmchanges ± S.E. for each nucleotide are summarized in thelower panel. B, shown is a summary of the meanGt changes ± S.E. obtained from theI/V relations in these experiments.

To illustrate how Vm changes correlate with the cell conductance changes, Fig.5 A shows an experiment in which the Vm responses to UTP and ATP were some of the largest obtained. The corresponding current-voltage relations in Fig.5 B show that during the UTP and ATP stimulation, Vmshifted away from the resting voltage; but notably, Gt decreased. A"
https://openalex.org/W2072276665,"Stimulation of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, Met, induces the inherent morphogenic program of epithelial cells. The multisubstrate binding protein Gab1 (Grb2-associated binder-1) is the major phosphorylated protein in epithelial cells following activation of Met. Gab1 contains a pleckstrin homology domain and multiple tyrosine residues that act to couple Met with multiple signaling proteins. Met receptor mutants that are impaired in their association with Gab1 fail to induce a morphogenic program in epithelial cells, which is rescued by overexpression of Gab1. The Gab1 pleckstrin homology domain binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and contains conserved residues, shown from studies of other pleckstrin homology domains to be crucial for phospholipid binding. Mutation of conserved phospholipid binding residues tryptophan 26 and arginine 29, generates Gab1 proteins with decreased phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate binding, decreased localization at sites of cell-cell contact, and reduced ability to rescue Met-dependent morphogenesis. We conclude that the ability of the Gab1 pleckstrin homology domain to bind phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate is critical for subcellular localization of Gab1 and for efficient morphogenesis downstream from the Met receptor.

To characterize signaling pathways downstream from the Met receptor involved in epithelial morphogenesis, we and others have used receptor chimeras to demonstrate that the Met receptor cytoplasmic domain is sufficient for the biological responses attributed to HGF and that the Met tyrosine kinase activity is required for these responses (4Komada M.

The greatest homology observed with the other IRS-1 family members lies within the N terminus of Gab1, which contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, suggesting a conserved role for the PH domain within these proteins (25Holgado-Madruga M.

However, unlike IRS-1, Gab1 lacks a PTB domain and instead has been shown in vivo to be recruited to the Met receptor both indirectly, through the Grb2 adapter protein, and directly, involving the multisubstrate binding site tyrosines, Tyr1349 and Tyr1356, in the Met C terminus (20Fixman E.D.

Gab1 contains multiple tyrosine residues, and following HGF stimulation of epithelial cells, it couples the Met receptor with the p85 subunit of PI3K and associated PI3K activity, SHP2, and PLCγ1 (24Maroun C.R.

MDCK cells expressing Met receptor mutants with decreased ability to recruit Gab1 fail to form branching tubules upon Met activation (21Fournier T.M. Kamikura D. Teng K. Park M. J. Biol.

To investigate the mechanism through which Gab1 mediates this function, we have undertaken a structure/function analysis of Gab1 and demonstrated that the Gab1 PH domain is essential for the ability of Gab1 to promote branching morphogenesis (24Maroun C.R.

In addition, we have established that the Gab1 PH domain is required to target Gab1 to the proximity of the cellular membrane, at sites of cell-cell contact in epithelial cells, and that this localization is also dependent on the activity of PI3K (24Maroun C.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence supports a role for PH domains in the regulated targeting of proteins to cell membranes through their interactions with inositol phospholipids (reviewed in Refs. 38Shaw G.

Amino acid residues implicated in phospholipid binding are highly conserved among PH domains, including that of Gab1, suggesting that the Gab1 PH domain also interacts with membrane phospholipids (41Isakoff S.

This possibility is further supported by the recent findings that the Gab1 PH domain can bind to PIP3 in vitro 2M. Holgado-Madruga, D. K. Moscatello, and A. J. Wong, submitted for publication.2M.

To establish whether phospholipid binding by the Gab1 PH domain is a prerequisite for its function, we have mutated conserved amino acids in its β2 strand (Trp26 and Arg29) implicated in phospholipid binding from studies of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and other PH domain-containing proteins (41Isakoff S.

We show here that a similar mutation at residues Trp26/Arg29 in the PH domain of Gab1 generates Gab1 proteins with reduced binding to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in vitro, reduced cellular localization to sites of cell-cell contact, and decreased ability to rescue Met-dependent morphogenesis. MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The generation of MDCK cell lines expressing CSF-Met receptor and its mutant N1358H, by retroviral infection, has been previously described (6Zhu H. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 359-366PubMed Google Scholar, 21Fournier T.M. Kamikura D. Teng K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22211-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For the generation of stable cell lines expressing wild type and mutant HA-tagged Gab1, the Gab1 cDNA cloned into the pCDNA1.1 vector was cotransfected with a PLXSH vector, which confers resistance to hygromycin, by the calcium phosphate method as described elsewhere (24Maroun C.R.

Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Cell lines were selected in hygromycin (300 μg/ml). For transient transfection assays, 293T cells were seeded at 1 × 106/100-mm Petri dish and transfected 24 h later with 2 μg of plasmid DNA encoding for wild type Gab1 or Gab1 mutants with or without CSF-Met or CSF-Met N1358H mutant cDNA following the calcium phosphate precipitation method (46Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Sixteen hours later, cells were washed twice in DMEM lacking FBS and then cultured for another 48 h in media containing 10% FBS, following which the cells were harvested. Antibodies raised in rabbit against a C-terminal peptide of human Met were used (47Rodrigues G.A. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2962-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-HA (HA.11) was purchased from Babco (Richmond, CA). Anti-SHP2 was kindly provided by Dr. G-S. Feng. Site-directed mutagenesis within the Gab1 PH domain was performed using the ChameleonTMdouble-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Trp26/Arg29 residues were converted to either Cys or Ala residues. The mutagenesis primers were the following: for the C/C mutant, 5′-TCGCCCCCGGAGAAGAAGCTTAAGCGTTATGCGTGTAAGAGATGTTGGTTTGTGTTGCGCAGTGGC-3′; for the A/A mutant, 5′-TCGCCCCCGGAGAAGAAGCTTAAGCGTTATGCGGCGAAGAGAGCGTGGTTTGTGTTGCGCAGTGGC-3′. The underlined sequences are mutated. GST fusion proteins were generated by cloning wild type Gab1 and A/A and C/C Gab1 mutants as aBamHI–EcoRI fragment into pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and expression in Escherichia coli BL21 strain. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST fusion proteins (10 pmol) were bound to 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 30 mm HEPES, pH 7, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.025% Nonidet P-40 (HNE). Labeled phospholipids were sonicated in the same buffer containing 20 μg/ml Ser(P). Unlabeled competitor lipids (dipalmitoyl phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; Matreya, Inc.) were sonicated at 100 μm with Ser(P) and 25 μm phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and diluted with Ser(P)/HNE, and constant amounts of labeled32P-PIP3 (800,000 cpm) were added. Beads with bound fusion proteins were incubated with 40 μl of labeled phospholipid with or without competitor for 1 h at 22 °C, and the beads were quickly washed twice with 1 ml of HNE, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Beads were subjected to extraction with 60 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1) and added directly to scintillation fluid for quantitation. Data presented were corrected for nonspecific binding by subtracting the counts bound to GST. MDCK cells overexpressing wild type Gab1 or the Gab1 mutants were plated on glass coverslips (Bellco Glass Inc.) in a 24-well dish (Nunc) for the indicated times in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, washed twice in PBS, and incubated for 10 min in PBS containing 50 mm ammonium chloride. Following one additional wash in PBS, cells were treated with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% FBS (buffer A) for 10 min at room temperature. Anti-HA was diluted (1:300) in buffer A, and after three washes in the same buffer, CY3-conjugated anti-mouse (1:2000) was added for 10 min, followed by three washes in buffer A. The glass coverslips were mounted onto slides in Immunofluore medium (ICN) and visualized using a Nikon Labophot-2 epifluorescence microscope. Photographs were taken using Eastman Kodak Co. TMZ3200 film. Cells were seeded at 1 × 106/100-mm dish. Twenty-four hours later, cells were washed once with DMEM and then starved overnight in 10 ml of DMEM containing 0.02% FBS. HGF (kindly provided by Dr. G. F. Vande Woude) was added at 100 units/ml in 2 ml for the indicated times. Cells were immediately lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4). MDCK cell lysates (2 mg of total protein), or 293T cell lysates (50 μg) were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Twenty microliters of a 50% slurry of either protein A- or protein G-Sepharose was added for an additional 1 h to collect immune complexes. Following three washes in lysis buffer, proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and then with primary antibody (1:1000) for an additional hour. Following five washes in TBST, proteins were revealed with secondary anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) or protein A (Life Technologies, Inc.) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The proteins were visualized with an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The ability of MDCK cells to form branching tubules was assayed as described previously (17Zhu H. Naujokas M.A. Fixman E.D. Torossian K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29943-29948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 103 cells were resuspended in 500 μl of collagen solution (Vitrogen 100 from Celtrix) prepared following the manufacturer's instructions and layered over 350 μl of the collagen solution in a 24-well plate. Cells were maintained in Liebowitz medium containing 5% FBS and allowed to form cysts for 5–7 days. For stimulations, HGF (5 units/ml) or recombinant human CSF-1 (50 ng/ml; kindly provided by Genetics Institute, Boston, MA) was added to the Liebowitz medium containing 5% FBS. Tubules were apparent by light microscopy 5–10 days after the addition of stimuli. The medium was changed every 4 days, and photographs were taken at day 14 on Kodak TMY400 films at a magnification of 10×. For the quantitation of the morphogenic response, 60 colonies in each of three independent cultures (wells) were scored for their ability to form branching tubules. The results were plotted as the average percentages derived from the number of cysts able to undergo tubulogenesis in cells expressing the Gab1 PH domain mutant proteins compared with cells expressing wild type Gab1. We have previously demonstrated that Gab1 functions as a multisubstrate docking protein that mediates branching morphogenesis downstream from the Met receptor (23Nguyen L. Holgado-Madruga M.

While PH domains are found in proteins with a broad range of activities, the three-dimensional structure of this motif is common to all; seven β-strands form two anti-parallel β-sheets that end with an α-helix (reviewed in Refs. 38Shaw G.

Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that the accumulation of apoptotic cells was preceded by a progressive decrease of the cell population in the G1 phase concomitant with a slight increase of the cell population in the G2/M phase in response to TGF-β1. TGF-β1 induced a transient increase in the expression of Cdc2, cyclin A, cyclin B, and cyclin D1 at an early phase of apoptosis. During TGF-β1-induced apoptosis, the transient increase in cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activities coincides with a dramatic increase in the hyperphosphorylated forms of RB. Treatment with roscovitine or olomoucine, inhibitors of Cdc2 and Cdk2, blocked TGF-β1-induced apoptosis by inhibiting RB phosphorylation. Overexpression of Bcl-2 or adenovirus E1B 19K suppressed TGF-β1-induced apoptosis by blocking the induction of Cdc2 mRNA and the subsequent activation of Cdc2 kinase, whereas activation of Cdk2 was not affected, suggesting that Cdc2 plays a more critical role in TGF-β1-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, we present the evidence that Cdc2 and Cdk2 kinase activity transiently induced by TGF-β1 phosphorylates RB as a physiological target in FaO cells and that RB hyperphosphorylation may trigger abrupt cell cycle progression, leading to irreversible cell death.

In eukaryotes, the cell cycle is coordinated by several protein kinases composed of a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) subunit(s) and its corresponding regulatory cyclin subunit(s), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (13Grana X. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lees E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The cell cycle machinery controlling TGF-β1-mediated growth arrest is relatively well understood. G1 cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are the mediators of the TGF-β1 effect on the G1/S transition (reviewed in Ref. 3Alexandrow M.G. Moses H.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1452-1457PubMed Google Scholar). The G1 cell cycle events that have been shown to be mediated by TGF-β1 in epithelial cells include an inhibition of Cdc2 synthesis, phosphorylation levels, and kinase activity (15Eblen S.T.

Additionally, TGF-β1 has been reported to induce the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27kip1, p21cip1, and p15ink4 and to enhance the association of these cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors with the relevant Cdk complexes (21Datto M.B.

Down-regulation of either Cdk2 activity or cyclin A expression by TGF-β1 has been used as a general indicator of the TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibitory effect (24Feng X.-H. Filvaroff E.H. Derynck R.

These effects on RB are postulated to be derived from negative effects of TGF-β1 on Cdk activity toward RB (17Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Whitehouse L.L. Livingston D.M.

Recently, apoptosis has been hypothesized to be the result of abnormal cell cycle control (30Meikrantz W. Schlegel R. J. Biol.

However, the physiological target(s) of these kinases during apoptosis have not been elucidated. The oncogene product Bcl-2 effectively protects cells from apoptotic cell death (41Newton K. Strasser A. Curr. Opin. Genetics Develop. 1998; 8: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Recently the inhibition of cell death by Bcl-2 has been linked to the slowdown of cell cycle progression (30Meikrantz W. Schlegel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10205-10209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 42Borner C. J. Biol.

Med. 1996; 183: 2219-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, the detailed action mechanism of Bcl-2 for death-sparing activity still remains to be clarified. We demonstrate here that TGF-β1 induces apoptosis in FaO rat hepatoma cells through the distinctive controlling mechanism of cell cycle components in FaO cells, which is contradictory to the mechanism for TGF-β1-induced G1 cell cycle arrest that was previously reported. In addition, we present the evidence for the first time that RB is a functional substrate of Cdc2 and Cdk2 kinase transiently activated by the signal of TGF-β1 to trigger apoptosis. Moreover, we show that overexpression of Bcl-2 protein protects the cells from TGF-β1-induced cell death by blocking the induction of Cdc2 mRNA and the subsequent activation of Cdc2 kinase to phosphorylate RB. Antibodies against Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk6, cyclin B, and cyclin D1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody against p27 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Antibodies against p21, Cdc2, and cyclin A were from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). Antibody against phosphospecific RB was provided by New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Histone H1 was purchased from Sigma. Recombinant RB-N terminus fusion protein containing RB residue 181–400 and RB-C terminus fusion protein containing 701–928 were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Roscovitine, olomoucine, and Pansorbin were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (San Diego, CA). [γ-32P]ATP and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and the protein assay reagents were from Bio-Rad. All other reagents and compounds were analytical grades. FaO rat hepatoma cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were split 1 day before TGF-β1 treatment. TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) was added to 70–80% confluent cells. FaO cells were split onto coverslips and incubated for 1 day prior to TGF-β1 treatment. Cells were treated with TGF-β1 for the indicated times and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times, and then incubated for 10 min in 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in PBS. The change of nuclear morphologies was examined by fluorescence microscopy. Total DNA was extracted from the cells at 0, 12, and 24 h after TGF-β1 treatment. Apoptosis was characterized by DNA fragmentation using TACSTM apoptotic DNA laddering kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). FaO cells were split onto the coverslips and incubated for 1 day prior to TGF-β1 treatment. Cells were treated with TGF-β1 for the indicated times and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) for 10 min. TUNEL assay of fragmented DNA was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). DNA content was assessed by staining ethanol-fixed cells with propidium iodide and monitoring by FACScan. Cell distribution was determined with a ModFit LT program (Verity Software House, Inc). Cells were washed in PBS and then lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) on ice for 15 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. Equal amounts of cell extracts (40 μg) were electrophoresed through 12% acrylamide SDS-denaturing gels, transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and probed with antibodies as recommended by the manufacturer. Detection was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total cellular RNA was prepared from FaO cells treated with TGF-β1 for different incubation times using RNAzolTM B (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendwood, TX), according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. mRNA was prepared from total RNA by use of oligo(dT)-cellulose resin (Life Technologies, Inc.). mRNA (10 μg) was loaded onto 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel. DNA probes for hybridization were labeled using a random priming kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [α-32P]dCTP. FaO cells were treated with TGF-β1 for different incubation times, and 1 × 107 cells were lysed in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer A (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml PMSF) at 4 °C for 15 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined, and 2 mg of protein was used for each co-immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating lysates with 10 μg of the anti-RB, anti-Cdc2, or anti-Cdk2 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by incubating with 60 μl of Pansorbin for 1 h and washed three times with ice-cold buffer A. The pellet was resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% glycerol, 14.4 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using standard electroblotting procedures. The presence of co-immunoprecipitated protein was confirmed by Western blotting using specific antibodies. Cells were collected at different incubation times with TGF-β1 and washed in PBS. Cells were lysed in buffer A for 15 min on ice. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. Protein concentrations were quantitated by Bio-Rad assay. A total of 500 μg of protein was used for each immunoprecipitation. Cdc2, Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6 in cell extracts were incubated with a specific antibody (1 μg/reaction) for 3 h at 4 °C. 15 μl of protein A/G-garose (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) was added into the mixture, which was then further incubated for 1 h. Immune complexes were centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 5 min and the precipitates were washed three times with buffer A and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). Cdk kinase assays on histone H1 were performed by mixing the respective immune complexes with 5 μg of histone H1 and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 30 μl of kinase buffer. Cdk kinase assays on RB were carried out in the same way using 5 μg of recombinant RB-N terminus fusion protein or RB-C terminus fusion protein. The kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min and then terminated with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue staining solution and dried. The extent of phosphorylation was measured by liquid scintillation counting of the gel slices of each substrate. FaO cells were transfected with a mammalian expression vector containing full-length bcl-2 cDNA and with a vector containing full-length E1B 19K cDNA (Ref. 44Memon S.A. Moreno M.B. Petrak D. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4644-4652PubMed Google Scholar; kindly provided by Dr. Zarchuck, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and selected with changes of fresh media containing G418 (500 μg/ml) for 3 weeks. FaO sublines stably transfected with an empty vector were used as a control. The expression of the transfected gene products in the selected cell lines was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. TGF-β1 is a potent apoptotic inducer in hepatocytes (4Oberhammer F. Bursch W. Parzefall W. Breit P. Erber E. Stadler M. Schulte-Hermann R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2478-2485PubMed Google Scholar, 5Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lin J.K. Chou C.K. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 385-388PubMed Google Scholar). FaO is a well differentiated hepatoma cell line that is very sensitive to the apoptotic effect of TGF-β1, even in complete media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, as we previously reported (12Choi K.S. Lim I.K. Brady J.N. Kim S-J. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 45Lim I.K. Joo H.J. Choi K.S. Sueoka E. Lee M.S. Fujuki H. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 induces cell death in FaO cells with morphological changes such as cell shrinkage and cytoplasmic blebbing, which are characteristic of progression of apoptosis (Fig.1 A). In addition, chromatin has a characteristic condensed and fragmented appearance following Hoechst 33258 staining of cells treated with TGF-β1 for 12 h. Moreover, TGF-β induced a clear 180–200-base pair internucleosomal DNA cleavage after TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 1 B). Next, we explored the possible differences between the TGF-β1-mediated apoptotic pathway and the TGF-β1-induced G1 cell cycle arrest pathway. First, we examined whether TGF-β1-induced G1 cell cycle arrest is a prerequisite for apoptosis. Interestingly, cell cycle analysis demonstrated that the induction of apoptosis by TGF-β1 was not preceded by G1 cell cycle arrest. Rather, a progressive decrease of the G1 phase population and an increase in the cells in G2/M phase were observed prior to TGF-β1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2). These results suggest that loss of G1 cell cycle arrest may be implicated in the TGF-β1-induced apoptotic mechanism. We then attempted to study whether these changes of the cell cycle profile during TGF-β1-induced apoptosis can be explained in terms of the changes in expression of the cell cycle regulatory components. We were interested in whether some cell cycle regulatory components are shared between the TGF-β1-induced apoptotic pathway and the TGF-β1 growth inhibitory pathway, or if the regulatory mechanisms controlling cell cycle progression are completely separate for the two pathways. We explored the expression of cyclins, Cdks, and Cdk inhibitors, which have previously been implicated in TGF-β1-mediated cell cycle arrest during TGF-β1-induced apoptosis (Fig.3 A). The protein levels of Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk6, cyclin E, and p27 were not significantly altered. The levels of proteins such as cyclin A, cyclin B, and cyclin D1, which are involved in the progression of the cell cycle, showed a gradual rise with a sustained peak at around 8 h after TGF-β1 treatment, and then a subsequent decline. Upon TGF-β1 treatment, the Cdc2 protein was induced at 4 h, reached its peak at 8 h, and then decreased to its previous level by 24 h. Several recent papers suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdc2 (46McGowan C.H. Russell P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2166-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 47Parker L.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1992; 257: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) is associated with the inactivation of Cdc2 kinase activity. However, no significant change in the tyrosine phosphorylation level of Cdc2 was observed during TGF-β1-induced apoptosis (data not shown). To investigate whether the changes in protein levels of some cell cycle components are caused by the changes in mRNA levels, Northern blot analysis was performed after TGF -β1 treatment (Fig. 3 B). Levels of Cdc2, cyclin A, and cyclin B mRNAs were dramatically induced at 2 h after TGF-β1 treatment and then showed a gradual decline. The level of cyclin D1 mRNA was induced at 2 h after TGF-β1 treatment and was sustained for at least 12 h. The mRNA level of p21 was quite abundant, but was slightly induced at 2 h after TGF-β1 treatment, and then gradually decreased. In contrast, Cdk2, cyclin E, and p27 did not demonstrate any significant changes in mRNA levels during the progression of TGF-β1-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that the expressions of cyclins, Cdks, or Cdk inhibitors involved in TGF-β1-induced growth inhibition are regulated differently during TGF-β1-induced apoptosis, except for a slight induction in p21. Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are regulated by their association with cyclins; cyclin A (Cdc2, Cdk2), B (Cdc2), D (Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6), and E (Cdk2) (13Grana X. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lees E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Since the expression of Cdc2 and cyclins including cyclin A, B, and D1 was changed during TGF-β1-induced apoptosis, we investigated whether the activities of cyclin-dependent kinases are affected by the changes in the expression of Cdc2 itself or the associated cyclins. The kinase activities associated with Cdc2 and Cdk2 were measured by immunoprecipitation with respective antibodies, followed by a kinase assay on histone H1 as an exogenous conventional substrate (Fig.4 A). Cdc2 kinase activity showed an approximately 4.4-fold rise after 8 h of treatment with TGF-β1, and a gradual decline after a peak in parallel with the change in the Cdc2 protein level as shown in Fig. 3 A. Interestingly, Cdk2-associated histone H1 kinase activity was also markedly increased, despite the fact that the Cdk2 protein level was not changed. Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated Cdk2 revealed the enhanced association of cyclin D1 with Cdk2 at the peak time of Cdk2 kinase activity (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that increased cyclin D1 expression contributes to the increase of Cdk2 kinase activity. Recent studies have reported that histone H1 is a poor substrate for Cdk4 and Cdk6 (48Sweeney K.J. Sarcevic B. Sutherland R.L. Musgrove E.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In consistent with their results, not only Cdk4 but also Cdk6 kinase activity on histone H1 was barely detected before or after TGF-β1 treatment in our study (data not shown). Therefore, the changes in Cdk4 and Cdk6 kinase activity were analyzed again using the RB-C terminus fusion protein containing residues 701–928, which is a commonly used substrate for Cdk4 or Cdk6 kinase assay. However, activation of Cdk4 and Cdk6 kinase on RB-C-terminal fusion protein was not significant compared with Cdc2 and Cdk2 (Fig. 4 A). The most studied G1 cyclin/Cdk substrate is the product of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB). Since the kinase activities of Cdks were transiently activated in this study, we investigated the phosphorylation status of endogenous RB in response to TGF-β1. Western blot analysis using anti-phosphospecific RB antibody demonstrated a dramatic increase in RB phosphorylation, which showed a peak at 8 h following TGF-β1 treatment (Fig.5 A), coinciding with the activation of Cdks observed in Fig. 4. The kinases responsible for RB phosphorylation in vivo have been reported to be members of the Cdk family, including Cdk2 in association with cyclin E and A, as well as Cdk4 and Cdk6 in association with D-type cyclins (reviewed in Ref. 49Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar). Massive RB hyperphosphorylation in response to TGF-β1 as shown in Fig. 5 A may not be explained by the slight increase in Cdk4 and Cdk6 kinase activity on RB. At least seven of potential Cdk phosphorylation sites (Ser-249, -807, and -811, and Thr-252, -373, -821, and -826) have been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo(50Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 51Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data suggest that N terminus of RB is also involved in RB hyperphosphorylation, although C-terminal fragment (amino acids 791–928) of RB has been conventionally used as an exogenous substrate for RB kinase such as Cdk2 and Cdk4. To examine which Cdk(s) play a major role for RB hyperphosphorylation, immune complex kinase assay of Cdk was performed using two types of RB substrate, including a recombinant RB-N terminus fusion protein containing RB residues 181–400 and an RB-C terminus fusion protein containing RB residues 701–928 (Fig. 5 B). Surprisingly, not only Cdk2 but also Cdc2 demonstrated a significant increase in RB kinase activity on both the N and C termini of RB protein, peaking at 8 h after TGF-β1 treatment. Interestingly, N-terminal RB protein phosphorylated by activated Cdc2 revealed two discrete bands with an equal intensity, whereas the RB protein phosphorylated by activated Cdk2 demonstrated a higher intensity in the upper shifted band. This result suggests that Cdc2 and Cdk2 kinase have a differential substrate specificity or preference for specific sites at RB-N terminus. In contrast, Cdk4 revealed a very trifling increase in kinase activity on RB-N terminus fusion protein. Cdk6 showed a slight activation on both RB-N terminus and RB-C terminus. These results indicate that activated Cdc2 as well as Cdk2 are responsible for a massive RB hyperphosphorylation following TGF-β1 treatment. We further examined whether the Cdk2 or Cdc2 complex binds stably to RB to facilitate RB phosphorylation in vivo. We immunoprecipitated Cdk2- and Cdc2-containing complexes, respectively, and tested for coprecipitation of RB. As shown in Fig. 5 C, Cdk2- or Cdc2-specific antibody precipitated Cdk2 or Cdc2, respectively, and coprecipitated more RB at the cell extracts prepared from cells treated with TGF-β1 for 8 h. Therefore, these results suggest that the association of RB with Cdc2 or Cdk2 complex increases at the time of activation of these kinases. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest the existence of Cdc2-RB and Cdk2-RB complexes in vivo, and RB is a physiological target of inappropriately activated Cdc2 and Cdk2 by TGF-β1. Recently, activation of cyclin-dependent kinases, either Cdc2 or Cdk2, has been shown to correlate with the onset of apoptosis (34Donaldson K.L. Goolsby G. Kiener P.A. Wahl A.F.

Although the spatial resolution was limited, slow upward propagation was resolved during the 9-day-long intrusion. In contrast, the earthquakes migrated rapidly upward during the first 12 hours of the swarm, and nearly all of the seismic energy was released in the first 2 days. Comparison of inversion results with accurate hypocenter locations will lead to improved understanding of magma transport through the brittle crust and of the causes of volcanic seismicity."
https://openalex.org/W2051601815,Development of an x-ray-transparent capsule that is suitable for water-saturated experiments has allowed the high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis of 10 angstrom phase from talc + H(2)O to be observed in situ in a multianvil apparatus with synchrotron radiation. The reaction talc + H(2)O = 10 angstrom phase was observed within 20 minutes at 6 gigapascals and 500 degrees C. The higher pressure vapor-absent reaction talc = 10 angstrom phase + enstatite + coesite was also observed. The 10 angstrom phase is therefore a good candidate for transporting water into Earth's mantle at subduction zones. The in situ technique may allow the hydration of other high-pressure mantle phases to be observed under dynamic conditions.

Aggregation of co-receptors such as CD19 with the antigen receptor has been suggested to modulate the signals necessary for the development and functioning of the humoral immune system. In this study, we demonstrate that engagement of the antigen receptor on peripheral blood B cells, but not naı̈ve splenic B lymphocytes, leads to rapid phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) on Tyr-701 and Ser-727. Interestingly, phosphorylation on tyrosine diminished with increased stimulation, whereas serine phosphorylation correlated directly with the level of BCR cross-linking. In contrast, phosphorylation of STAT3 occurs exclusively on serine and is sensitive to inhibitors of the PI3-kinase and the ERK1/2 pathways. Finally, we show that co-ligation of CD19 with the BCR results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 relative to BCR cross-linking alone, establishing CD19 as a positive modulator of BCR-mediated STAT activation.

A distinct characteristic of all STAT family members is the primary regulation of their activity through rapid tyrosine phosphorylation (10Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6593-6599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of STAT1 and STAT3, phosphorylation on Ser-727 in addition to phosphorylation on Tyr-701 or Tyr-705, respectively, is essential to maximize their transactivation capabilities (16Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 appears to require MAP kinase activity, and expression of dominant-negative ERK2 suppresses STAT-mediated gene expression via the IFNα receptor (17David M. Petricoin III, E.F. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Although STAT activation through a large variety of cytokine and growth factor receptors has been extensively investigated, relatively limited information is available on the role of these signaling moieties in antigen receptor-mediated signal transduction. As cytokine and antigen receptors combine to regulate lymphocyte growth and differentiation, STAT activation may contribute to this regulation in the context of eliciting an antigen-specific immune response. The quality and strength of the signal initiated by the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) can undergo positive or negative modulation through the co-engagement of cell surface molecules such as CD19, CD22, and the Fc receptors. In particular, CD19 signaling has been shown to augment BCR-mediated Ca2+ mobilization and activation of the MAP kinase and PI3-kinase pathways (18Fearon D.T. Carter R.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 127-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 19Tedder T.F. Inaoki M. Sato S. Immunity. 1997; 6: 107-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Hence, we were interested in investigating whether CD19 modulates the degree or nature of STAT activation by the BCR. Previous studies by Rothstein and colleagues (20Karras J. Huo L. Wang Z. Frank D. Zimmet J. Rothstein T. J. Immunology. 1996; 157: 2299-2309PubMed Google Scholar) showed that stimulation of the antigen receptor on murine splenic B lymphocytes results in the delayed and protein synthesis-dependent activation of STAT1 and STAT3. Here we report that, in contrast to these previous findings, STAT1 undergoes rapid tyrosine and serine phosphorylation after BCR stimulation of human Burkitt lymphoma cells, or human and murine peripheral blood B cells. In addition, STAT3 becomes phosphorylated exclusively on Ser-727 in an ERK1/2 and PI3-kinase-dependent manner. STAT1 tyrosine, but not serine phosphorylation, was attenuated upon increasing levels of receptor cross-linking. Simultaneous co-ligation of CD19 to the BCR was found to augment the degree of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. RAMOS cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Wortmannin and PD98059 were obtained from Calbiochem. IFNα was a generous gift from Hoffman LaRoche. Biotin-conjugated anti-human IgM F(ab′)2fragments (Southern Biotechnology) or anti-murine IgM F(ab′)2 (Jackson Immunoresearch) were used for BCR cross-linking at the concentration and time points outlined in the figure legends. For experiments depicted in Fig. 4, 1 × 106 cells were suspended in media containing preformed complexes of biotin-conjugated anti-IgM F(ab′)2, biotin-conjugated anti-CD19 (Dako Corp.) and egg white avidin for the indicated times. Following treatment, cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium-vanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were centrifuged and protein concentration was determined by Bradford (Bio-Rad). Proteins were detected with phospho-specific STAT1-Y701, STAT3-Y705, and p44/42 MAP kinase from New England Biolabs or with phospho-specific STAT1-S727 and STAT3-S727 antisera purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibodies to STAT1, STAT3, and ERK2 from Transduction Laboratories were used for reprobing. All blots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence. Spleens were excised from BALB/c mice, and cells were dispersed by grinding between glass slides. Red blood cells were lysed with hypotonic lysis buffer, and T lymphocytes were depleted by complement-mediated lysis using Thy 1.1-specific monoclonal antibodies (H013.4 and FD75). Total lymphocytes were isolated from Leuko-Pacs (human) or whole blood (murine) using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human lymphocytes were further purified by incubation on ice for 30 min with monoclonal anti-human CD19, biotin-conjugated antibody (clone SJ25-C1, Caltag Laboratories) at 4 °C, followed by incubation with Streptavidin MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were loaded onto MACS High Gradient Magnetic Separation Columns (Miltenyi Biotec), and CD19+ B lymphocytes were eluted into 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Signaling through the B cell receptor in splenic B cells has previously been shown to cause the delayed activation of STAT1 and STAT3 (20Karras J. Huo L. Wang Z. Frank D. Zimmet J. Rothstein T. J. Immunology. 1996; 157: 2299-2309PubMed Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether co-engagement of the CD19 co-receptor would be able to alter this response. We therefore stimulated RAMOS B cells by cross-linking the B cell receptor with 1 μg/ml anti-IgM-specific antibody for the indicated time points and analyzed STAT1 phosphorylation on Tyr-701. Surprisingly, we found STAT1 to undergo very rapid tyrosine phosphorylation, which was already detectable after 2 min of stimulation, peaked at 10 min, and decreased to basal levels within 4 h (Fig. 1 A). This was unexpected because Karras et al. (20Karras J. Huo L. Wang Z. Frank D. Zimmet J. Rothstein T. J. Immunology. 1996; 157: 2299-2309PubMed Google Scholar) reported that STAT1 activation via the B cell receptor occurs with a 2–3-h delay, and in addition requires protein synthesis. We therefore decided to test whether the observed differences might be because of the intensity of the stimulation. Surprisingly, using increasing amounts of cross-linking antibody, we found that STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, although initially correlating directly with the levels of stimulation (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2–4 and 8–10), diminished with further increases in BCR cross-linking (lanes 5–7 and 11–13). This bell-shaped activation curve (Fig. 1 B, lower panel) was observed 2 min (lanes 2–7) as well as 30 min (lanes 8–13) after stimulation, thus excluding the possibility that our observation was merely because of a shift in activation kinetics. In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 on Ser-727 is essential to maximize their transactivation potential (16Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 correlated directly with the level of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation after BCR cross-linking by probing several of the lysates shown in Fig. 1 B for the presence of Ser-727 phosphorylation. Interestingly, the phosphorylation on Ser-727 followed a strict dose-dependent response, even at the concentrations where phosphorylation of Tyr-701 started to decrease (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2 and 3). This result suggests that the diminished tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 observed after cross-linking with high concentrations of anti-Ig antibody is not because of receptor desensitization or internalization because a parallel decrease in tyrosine and serine phosphorylation would be expected under such circumstances. As such, the concentration of anti-Ig antibody (15 μg/ml) used for stimulation by Karras et al. (20Karras J. Huo L. Wang Z. Frank D. Zimmet J. Rothstein T. J. Immunology. 1996; 157: 2299-2309PubMed Google Scholar) was also ineffective in inducing STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation in our hands (Fig.1 B, lanes 7 and 13) and provided a possible explanation for the contradicting results. To explore whether the differences between our observations and those of Karras et al. (20Karras J. Huo L. Wang Z. Frank D. Zimmet J. Rothstein T. J. Immunology. 1996; 157: 2299-2309PubMed Google Scholar) were because of differences in established cell linesversus primary B cells, or were indeed based upon different extents of stimulation, we isolated primary murine splenocytes and subjected them to stimulation with anti-IgM antibodies for 2 min (Fig.1 D) or 30 min (data not shown), ranging in concentration from 3–300 μg/ml. Unexpectedly, we were unable to detect any tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 at any level of stimulation with anti-IgM antibodies (lanes 3–7), whereas pronounced STAT1-Y701 phosphorylation was observed after exposure of the cells to murine IFNα (lane 2). The effectiveness of BCR stimulation was verified by analyzing the extent of induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation by the antigen receptor (Fig. 1 D, lower panel). Thus, the observed discrepancies do not appear to be because of variances in the extent of BCR stimulation. Another possible explanation for these apparently contradicting results is the fact that our experiments used human cell lines, whereas the lab of Rothstein and co-workers (20Karras J. Huo L. Wang Z. Frank D. Zimmet J. Rothstein T. J. Immunology. 1996; 157: 2299-2309PubMed Google Scholar) performed their studies exclusively in murine B cells. We therefore decided to test for STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation as a consequence of anti-IgM stimulation in primary human peripheral blood B lymphocytes. Human PBLs were isolated from Leuko-Pacs, and CD19 positive B cells were isolated by magnetic cell separation. Subsequent stimulation of the purified B cells for 5 min with 0.2–25 μg/ml anti-IgM antibodies caused a dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (Fig. 1 E, lanes 1–5). This finding meant that STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation via the BCR is either restricted to cells of human origin or is only found in PBLs but not naı̈ve splenic B cells. To address this last possibility, we subjected murine PBLs to anti-IgM cross-linking. Like their human counterparts, murine PBLs also displayed STAT1-Y701 phosphorylation after BCR cross-linking (lanes 6 and 7). Thus, it appears that only PBLs, but not naı̈ve splenic B cells are capable of inducing STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation via the BCR. We next investigated whether STAT3 can be similarly activated via the antigen receptor. Interestingly, anti-Ig antibody treatment did not lead to phosphorylation of STAT3 on Tyr-705 in RAMOS at any of the time points analyzed (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3–9), although tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 could be readily observed following engagement of the IFNα/β receptor (lane 2). To exclude the possibility that the lack of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation via the BCR was a peculiarity of the RAMOS cell line, we repeated the stimulation in PBLs with identical results (data not shown). As STAT3 requires similar serine phosphorylation as STAT1 for maximal transcriptional activation capabilities (16Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar), we continued by analyzing STAT3 serine phosphorylation. BCR cross-linking resulted in the rapid serine phosphorylation of STAT3 within 5–10 min (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2–4), which declined to basal levels after approximately 4 h (lanes 5–8). Previous studies suggested that STAT serine phosphorylation is because of the activity of the MAP kinase family members ERK1/2 (17David M. Petricoin III, E.F. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the extent of ERK1/2 activation in the above lysates using antibodies specific for activated ERK1/2. As shown in Fig. 2 C, cross-linking the BCR activates ERK1/2 with a kinetic that slightly precedes that of STAT3-S727 phosphorylation (lanes 2–8). Based on our observations regarding STAT1-Y701 phosphorylation, we wanted to ensure that our inability to observe STAT3-Y705 phosphorylation is not because of stimulation with inappropriate concentrations of anti-Ig antibodies. Consequently, cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of anti-Ig antibody over a range of 2 orders of magnitude; however, no phosphorylation of STAT3 on Tyr-705 was detectable under any circumstances. (Fig. 2 D, lanes 3–8). In contrast, STAT3-S727 phosphorylation correlated directly with the amount of BCR stimulation (Fig.2 E, lanes 2–7), thus paralleling the phosphorylation profile observed for STAT1-S727. The significance of serine phosphorylation of STAT3 in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation is unclear, as STAT3 phosphorylated only on serine residues is unable to translocate to the nucleus or bind DNA. It is possible that serine-phosphorylated STAT3 functions as an adapter protein (21Pfeffer L.M. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer S.R. Murti A. Shi W. Yang C.H. Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), coupling or recruiting other signaling molecules such as PI3-kinase to the BCR. To investigate the role of ERK1/2 in the Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3, we tested the effect of PD98059, a specific MEK inhibitor, for its ability to alter STAT3-S727 phosphorylation in response to BCR stimulation. Cells were pretreated for 30 min with PD98059 prior to BCR cross-linking. Indeed, preincubation with the inhibitor resulted in a drastic and concentration-dependent reduction of ERK1/2 activation after BCR stimulation (Fig.3 A, lanes 4 and5), and this was paralleled by a concomitant decrease of STAT3-S727 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4 and5). We further explored the possibility that PI3-kinase mediates ERK1/2 activation and STAT3-S727 phosphorylation because the p85 regulatory subunit of this enzyme has been found to associate with the BCR (22Gold M.R. Chan V.W. Turck C.W. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2012-2022PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, lane 3, preincubation of the cells with the specific PI3-kinase inhibitor Wortmannin abrogates ERK1/2 activation in response to BCR cross-linking. As expected, STAT3-S727 phosphorylation was also completely abolished in the absence of PI3-kinase activity (Fig.3 B, lane 2). Thus, our results show that ERK1/2 activation through the BCR requires the activity of PI3-kinase and strongly suggest that ERK1/2 is responsible for mediating STAT3-S727 phosphorylation. STAT3 serine phosphorylation normally occurs after its tyrosine phosphorylation (23Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6915-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In fact, initial serine phosphorylation negatively modulates subsequent phosphorylation on tyrosine (24Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to investigate whether the lack of STAT3-Y705 phosphorylation in response to BCR cross-linking is a result of the rapidly occurring phosphorylation on Ser-727. As outlined above, both PD98059 and Wortmannin are able to prevent STAT3-S727 phosphorylation; however, neither inhibitor is able to restore STAT3-Y705 phosphorylation in response to BCR stimulation (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3–5). This was not because of concomitant adverse effects of the inhibitors on STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation because IFNα-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was not prevented under these conditions (Fig. 3 C, lanes 6–9). Simultaneous engagement of the co-receptor CD19 and the antigen receptor has been demonstrated to synergistically affect B cell activation in vivo and in vitro (25Carter R.H. Fearon D.T. Science. 1992; 256: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 26Rickert R.C. Rajewsky K. Roes J. Nature. 1995; 376: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 27Engel P. Zhou L.J. Ord D.C. Sato S. Koller B. Tedder T.F. Immunity. 1995; 3: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). This has been attributed, in part, to enhanced ERK1/2 activation observed after co-ligation of CD19 and the BCR (28Tooze R.M. Doody G.M. Fearon D.T. Immunity. 1997; 7: 59-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We were interested in determining whether the modulatory role of CD19 would extend to the BCR-mediated activation of STAT proteins by tyrosine phosphorylation. Cells were subjected to stimulation with a subthreshold concentration of anti-Ig in the presence of increasing amounts of anti-CD19 antibodies. As previously reported (28Tooze R.M. Doody G.M. Fearon D.T. Immunity. 1997; 7: 59-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), co-ligation of CD19 to the antigen receptor dramatically enhanced ERK1/2 activation when compared with stimulation by anti-Ig alone (Fig.4 A, lane 5 versus lanes 6 and 7). Similarly, the co-ligation of CD19 resulted in significantly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 relative to BCR cross-linking alone (Fig.4 B, lane 2 versus lanes 3, 4, and 5 versus 6 and7), whereas CD19 cross-linking alone was unable to trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (data not shown). Co-ligation of CD19 with the BCR does not appear to merely expedite the kinetics of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation because the synergistic effects can be observed at different time points (lanes 2–4 and5–7). However, even the co-ligation of CD19 with the BCR was unable to trigger the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (data not shown). Hence, these results establish CD19 as a positive modulator of BCR-mediated STAT activation. In summary, our results show that STAT1 and STAT3 participate in the rapid and protein synthesis-independent signaling through the BCR. With respect to STAT 1, the observed discrepancy with previous reports is most likely because of different subpopulations of the B cells used in the experiments. The absence of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation at any level of BCR engagement is not likely based on inefficient STAT3-BCR interaction because stimulation of the BCR results in robust serine phosphorylation of STAT3. In B and T cells, signals originating from the antigen receptor and coreceptor(s) play a crucial role in directing cell fate decisions such as proliferation, anergy, or apoptosis. Insofar as B cell receptor cross-linking in vitro can be translated into affinity-driven antigen binding in vivo, it is tempting to speculate that the divergence of STAT phosphorylation is contributing to the execution of these fate decisions.

C6des-748–913 exhibited approximately 60–70% of the hemolytic activity of full-length C6 when assayed for Alternative Pathway activity, but when measured for the Classical Pathway, C6des-748–914 was only 4–6% as effective as C6. The activity difference between C6 and C6des-748–913 for the two complement pathways can be explained by a greater stability of newly formed metastable C5b* when produced by the Alternative Pathway compared with that made by the Classical Pathway.

The protein also has regional homology with complement C9 and a more restricted homology with the T-lymphocyte granular protein, perforin (1DiScipio R.G. Hugli T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16197-16206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Haefliger J.-A. Tschopp J. Vial N. Jenne D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18041-18051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of C6 is to link with C5b in order to form the C5b-6 complex (3Podack E.R. Esser A.F. Biesecker G. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 151: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4DiScipio R.G. Smith C.A. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Hugli T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10629-10636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This coupling entails an interaction of C6 with a metastable intermediate of the activated fifth component of complement, designated here as C5b*. After C5 is cleaved by C5 convertase the larger fragment, C5b*, is endowed with a transient ability to form an irreversible complex with C6. If C5b* fails to bind C6 within a short period, C5b* activity decays permanently (4DiScipio R.G. Smith C.A. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Hugli T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10629-10636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cooper N.R. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1970; 132: 775-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A further manifestation of this irreversibility is that if C5b-6 were dissociated by chaotrophs, the complex cannot reform (4DiScipio R.G. Smith C.A. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Hugli T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10629-10636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of C5b-6 is the first step in the construction of the membrane attack complex (MAC),1 which is responsible for generating transmembrane channels through target cells. The MAC has the structure of a phospholipid membrane-embedded tubule having a leaflet projecting from within the interior wall. The MAC in its complete state creates a stable circular transmembrane channel of ∼100 Å (for reviews on the MAC see Refs. 6DiScipio R.G. Rother K. Till G.O. Hansch G.M. The Complement System. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 50-68Google Scholar, 7Podack E.R. Tschopp J. Mol. Immunol. 1984; 21: 589-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Muller-Eberhard H.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1986; 4: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). How the modules and regions of C6 participate in the formation of the MAC is an ongoing topic of research. The demonstration that C6 can link with C7, C84, and C9 in forming the denaturant-resistant part of the MAC (9Podack E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8641-8647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the domain of C6 homologous to that of C9 is likely to be responsible for C6 integration into the cylindrical part of the MAC. The carboxyl-terminal domain has been reported to be responsible for C5b interaction (2Haefliger J.-A. Tschopp J. Vial N. Jenne D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18041-18051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding studies using a carboxyl-terminal fragment of the C6, containing both FIMs, demonstrated that this polypeptide has a reversible affinity for C5 (10DiScipio R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17087-17094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, investigators studying a human subtotal deficiency of C6 discovered that the molecular basis for this genetic disorder is an aberrant donor splice junction toward the 3′-end of the gene (at intron 15). This results in the translation of a protein with a truncated carboxyl terminus thereby lacking the FIMs. Because this dysmorphic C6 still possessed bactericidal activity, the role of the FIMs as linkage units for C5 was called into question (11Wurzner R. Hobart M.J. Fernie B.A. Mewar D. Potter P.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1877-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Wurzner R. Orren A. Potter P. Morgan B.P. Ponard D. Spath P. Brai M. Schulze M. Happe L. Gotze O. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1991; 83: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis is that C6 evolved its elaborate mosaic structure for functional purposes; therefore, the FIMs must impart some useful quality to the molecule. Accordingly, we designed experiments guided by this hypothesis. By using both the baculovirus and the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) expression systems, C6 and C6-derived proteins lacking the FIMs and lacking both CCP modules and FIMs were produced by insect cells and CHO cells. These expressed proteins were isolated and studied. The new results presented here demonstrate that the association of C5 with C6 is more complex than was hitherto believed, and it involves at least two binding interactions. Although not absolutely required for C6 activity, the FIMs have been found to be C5-interactive modules that enable the optimal formation of C5b-6. Sheep erythrocytes were from Colorado Serum Co. (Denver, CO). Dibutyl phthalate and dioctyl phthalate were purchased from Aldrich. EX-Cell 400R was from JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS), and fetal bovine serum was from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Ingredients for CHO growth medium, which was comprised of Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum with or without geneticin (G418 sulfate), were all from Life Technologies, Inc. Nitrocellulose membranes were from Sartorius (Surrey, UK), and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-murine IgG was from Bio-Rad. Complement components C5–9 as well as factors B and D were isolated from a single batch of frozen recovered human plasma (13DiScipio R.G. Pinz Sweeney S. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14DiScipio R.G. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Cobra venom factor (CVF) was prepared by gel filtration followed by anion exchange chromatography (15Eggertsen G. Lind P. Sjoquist J. Mol. Immunol. 1981; 18: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The plasmids, pBacPAK 9 andBsu36I-digested BacPAK 6 were purchased fromCLONTECH Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). Guanidine HCl was from Life Technologies, Inc.. Pwo DNA polymerase was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. HEPES, sodium thiocyanate, and hemolysin were from Sigma. Sodium [125I]iodide was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The insect cell lines Sf9 and TN5 along with Grace's insect cell culture medium were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), and CHO-K1 cells were purchased from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Porton Down, Salisbury, UK). DNA coding for human C6 was available from the original cloning from a cDNA liver library (1DiScipio R.G. Hugli T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16197-16206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to subclone C6 DNA, full-length constructs were made by ligation. Then the polymerase chain reaction (Perkin-Elmer) was employed using primers that were engineered to position a KpnI restriction site on the 5′-end along with NotI or XhoI restriction sites on the 3′-end. Oligonucleotide primers used to make C6 and truncated C6 proteins are as follows: C6, forward primer, 5′-GGGTACCATGGCCAGACGCTCTGTCTTGTAC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-CGCGGCCGCCTAGGCCAAACACTTTCCAGGAT-3′. C6des-748–913: the forward primer was the same as that for C6 and reverse primer, 5′-CGCGGCCGCCTATTTTGTTAGAGTATCTTTTTCTCA-3′. C6des-611–913: the forward primer was the same as that for C6 and reverse primer, 5′-CGCCTCGAGTCATTTCATTTCTTCATCATCATTGA-3′. By using the engineered restriction sites DNA segments encoding full-length C6, C6des-748–913, and C6des-611–913 were subcloned into the expression vectors pBacPAK 9 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, DeSchelp, Netherlands) for the insect and mammalian systems, respectively. The inserts were sequenced by automated DNA sequencing using an ABI Prism model 377 sequencer. For the baculovirus system the engineered plasmids were used to generate recombinant viruses, which were propagated using Sf9 cells. However, for protein expression TN5 cells were employed because these cells gave better yields. For the mammalian system, CHO cells were maintained and transfected with recombinant plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (16Rushmere N.K. Tomlinson S. Morgan B.P. Immunology. 1997; 90: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The expressed proteins were purified first by passage through a column (1 × 10 cm) of DEAE-Sephacel equilibrated with 20 mmimidazole HCl, pH 7, 0.15 m NaCl. None of the recombinant C6 proteins bound to DEAE-Sephacel using these conditions, but many contaminant proteins were removed. The unadsorbed fraction containing recombinant C6 proteins were immediately applied to an affinity column (1 × 10 cm) of rabbit anti-C6-IgG-Sepharose. After washing the column with 2 m KCl, recombinant proteins were eluted with 4 m guanidine Hcl. After dialysis the proteins were concentrated in an Amicon stirred filtration unit using a PM 30 membrane (Stonehouse, UK). Western blots were performed similarly to that described (17Gershoni J.M. Palade G.M. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1988; 33: 1-58PubMed Google Scholar) with the major modification being that the reactive protein bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence light detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expressed forms of C6 were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an rabbit antibody reactive to the low density lipoprotein module within human C6 (18Kemeny D.M. Johnston A.P. Turner M.W. Immunochemistry: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 147-175Google Scholar). Complement hemolytic assays and data analyses were done similarly to published methods (19Whaley K. North J. Dodds A.W. Sim R.B. Complement: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 19-47Google Scholar, 20DiScipio R.G. Gagnon J. Mol. Immunol. 1982; 19: 1425-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Nelson R.A. Jensen J.

Academic Press, New York1977: 137-241Google Scholar). Briefly, for Classical Pathway assays, sensitized sheep erythrocytes bearing guinea pig C1 (EAC1) were used. The assay buffer was DGVB2+, which contained dextrose (0.14 m), gelatin (0.1%), veronal (2.4 mm) buffer, pH 7.6, 70 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.4 mm CaCl2. Assays were performed by incubating at 37 °C for 30 min samples of expressed C6 proteins with EAC1 along with a human plasma depleted of C6. For the Alternative Pathway rabbit erythrocytes were reacted with a human plasma depleted of C6 in DGVB containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mmEGTA. Results of hemolytic assays were expressed as CH50 units/mg. Assays for C5b-6 were carried out using sheep erythrocytes that had been preincubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 37 °C because this chemical treatment renders erythrocytes sensitive to reactive lysis (23Shin M.L. Hansch G. Hu V.W. Nicholson-Weller A. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 1777-1782PubMed Google Scholar). For each assay variable amounts of C5b-6 (0–0.14 μg) in DGVB were preincubated with dithiothreitol-treated erythrocytes (107 cells) for 1 min followed by the addition of C7 (0.15 μg), C8 (0.2 μg), and C9 (0.4 μg). After 30 min at 37 °C, 1 ml of DGVB was added, and the samples centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm. Subsequently, the optical density at 413 nm was recorded. By using purified C5b-6, a standard curve relating the concentration of C5b-6 to the level of hemolysis was determined with the result that C5b-6 was calculated to contain approximately 105CH50 units/mg. The effect of factors H and I on the Classical Pathway hemolytic activities of C6 and C6des-FIMs was performed by incubating sensitized sheep erythrocytes with isolated Classical Pathway components as follows: C2 (2 μg/ml), C3 (50 μg/ml), C4 (20 μg/ml), C5 (4 μg/ml), C7 (3 μg/ml), C8 (4 μg/ml), and C9 (3 μg/ml) with various amounts of C6 or C6des-FIMs (0–0.75 μg/ml) in presence of factors H (0–100 μg/ml) and I (0–6 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were centrifuged, and the absorbance at 413 nm of the supernatants was recorded. C5b-6 was made in a fluid phase by activating C5 (0.4 mg/ml) using a preformed fluid phase C5 convertase, CVF,Bb (0.02 mg/ml) in the presence of C6 (0.2 mg/ml) for 15 h at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris- HCl, pH 7.8, 75 mmNaCl. The complex enzyme, CVF,Bb, was prepared by combining CVF (0.13 mg/ml) with factor B (0.26 mg/ml) and factor D (0.01 mg/ml) in 20 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7, 0.075 m NaCl, 50 μm NiCl2 for 30 min at 37 °C (4DiScipio R.G. Smith C.A. Muller-Eberhard H.J. Hugli T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10629-10636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, C5b-6 was purified by adsorption onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (1.5 × 20 cm) followed by elution with a linear salt gradient consisting of 150 ml each of 0.075 m NaCl to 0.3m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. C5b-6 elutes after uncoupled C5b and C6. To test the incorporation of recombinantly expressed C6 proteins to join with fluid phase C5b, C5 (0 -0.1 mg/ml) in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.15 m NaCl was mixed with C6, C6des-FIMs, or C6des-CCP/FIMs (0–0.05 mg/ml), along with a 1 to 20 molar ratio of CVF,Bb to C5; and the mixtures were incubated for 15 h at 37 °C. To determine the percent of C6 or C6des-FIMs incorporation into complex with C5b results of hemolytic assays were used. Levels of C5b,6 or C5b,6des-FIMs that formed were estimated by interpolation from a standard curve, described previously, relating C5b-6 hemolytic activity to the amount of C5b-6. Measurements of the half-lives of the activity of metastable C5b* were determined for both major complement pathways. For the Classical Pathway, EAC1 in DGVB2+ were combined with 1/5th volume of a human plasma depleted of C6 for 3 min at 37 °C followed by rapid washing in ice-cold DGVB/EDTA. The cells were suspended in DGVB/EDTA and incubated at 37 °C. At various times aliquots (50 μl) were withdrawn and mixed with DGVB/EDTA containing C6 (0.1 μg), C7 (0.1 μg), C8 (0.2 μg), and C9 (0.4 μg) in 50 μl. Hemolysis was measured at 413 nm after 30 min at 37 °C. For the Alternative Pathway, a similar procedure was followed except rabbit erythrocytes were used, and the preincubation time was 7 min. Measurements on the dissociation of 125I-C5b deposited on erythrocytes as a result of the action of C5 convertases of both pathways were determined using procedures to activate the two complement pathways similar to those stated previously. Erythrocytes were preincubated for 2–7 min with a human plasma depleted of C6 along with 125I-C5, which was radiolabeled using immobilized lactoperoxidase (24David G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). After washing and resuspending in DGVB/EDTA, the cells were incubated at 37 °C. At various times aliquots (55 μl) were removed, layered over 110 μl of dibutyl phthalate:dioctyl phthalate (8:3, v/v), and the tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 1 min. The bottoms of the tubes, containing the cell pellets, were cut off and counted in an LKB Wallac 1282 CompuGamma counter. The data were subtracted from counts of radioactivity of125I-C5 bound to cells, which contained decayed C5 convertase. The amount of C3b deposited on rabbit erythrocytes and sensitized sheep erythrocytes was determined by incubating these cells with 125I-labeled C3 (produced by using a solid phase lactoperoxidase method (24David G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar)) in DGVB, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA or DGVB2+ containing plasma depleted of C6 for 30 min at 37 °C. As controls similar mixtures were used, but the buffer was DGVB, 1 mm EDTA. Subsequently the cells were washed once in cold DGVB and resuspended. Aliquots were layered over 100 μl of oil (dibutyl phthalate:dioctyl phthalate, 0.8:0.3), and the cells were centrifuged through the oil layer at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. The bottoms of the tubes were cut off, and radioactivity was measured in an LKB Wallac 1282 CompuGamma counter. Binding studies were performed as follows: C6, truncated C6 proteins, and control proteins were adsorbed onto NUNC polystyrene wells (USA Scientific Plastics, Ocala, FL) at 4 °C for 15 h. After washing and blocking in 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 125I-C5 (∼150,000 cpm) was added in buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) containing various concentrations of sodium chloride (0.037–0.15 m) and 10 mg/ml ovalbumin. After 1 h at 4 °C the wells were drained and washed once, and the radioactivity was quantified using an LKB Wallac 1282 CompuGamma counter. To measure the affinity of C5 for C6, C6 was immobilized onto microtiter wells, and these were blocked and washed as described. Increasing concentrations (0–1.6 m) unlabeled C5 in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 0.15 m NaCl, or 75 mm NaCl, 10 mg/ml ovalbumin was then allowed to compete with125I-labeled C5 for binding to C6 over 48 h at 4 °C. After draining and one brief washing bound C5 was measured in an LKB Wallac 1282 CompuGamma counter. Scatchard analysis of the data was used to estimate the affinity constants of C5 for C6 (25Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17798) Google Scholar). The stability of C5b-6 or C5b-C6des-FIMs was determined by incubating these complexes with various concentrations of sodium chloride or sodium thiocyanate for 1 h at 37 °C followed by dialysis and measurement of hemolytic activities. An outline scheme showing a comparison of the basic features of complement C6 and the truncated expressed forms of C6 with C9 is presented in Fig. 1. As described previously C6 contains an amino-terminal domain homologous to C9, which includes a segment of ∼330 amino acids related to perforin, followed by a domain consisting of two CCP modules and two FIMs. In order to elucidate the function of the carboxyl-terminal domain of this protein, C6, C6des-748–913 (C6des-FIMs), and C6des-611–913 (C6des-CCP/FIMs) were expressed using baculovirus and mammalian expression systems. For the baculovirus system, recombinant viruses were made and propagated in Sf9 cells, but because these cells produced little heterologous protein, TN5 cells were used to synthesize all C6 types. Synthesis of the C6 proteins by the mammalian system employed CHO cells (Fig. 2). Although the yields from both systems were very low (<0.2 μg/ml), the amounts recovered were adequate to perform the necessary experiments. Expressed forms of C6 were purified by affinity adsorption, quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and assayed for complement hemolytic activities initiated by both Alternative and Classical Pathways. C6des-FIMs had between 60 and 70% of the specific activity of full-length C6 for the Alternative Pathway but only 4–6% for the Classical Pathway. C6des-CCP/FIMs had little detectable activity from either of these assays (Fig. 3). The recombinant forms of C6 gave a similar spectrum of activities independent of the mode of expression (i.e. whether synthesized by insect or CHO cells). However, since the baculovirus expression system gave better yields than the mammalian system, C6 proteins synthesized by the former method were employed for all subsequent studies. The ability of the various forms of C6 to combine with C5b in the fluid phase to generate the C5b-6 complex was determined next. This was done by reacting a fluid phase C5 convertase, CVF,Bb with C5 and either C6, C6des-FIMs, or C6des-CCP/FIMs. The outcome of this experiment was that C6des-FIMs had only ∼7% of the capacity to link with fluid phase C5b as did full-length C6, but C6des-CCP/FIMs had no activity (Fig.4). An explanation was required as to why C6des-FIMs had such strong Alternative Pathway activity. We noticed during assays for the Alternative Pathway that tubes containing full-length C6 exhibited lysis prior to those containing equivalents of C6des-FIMs. Therefore, we measured hemolysis as a function of time using functional equivalents of C6 and C6des-FIMs for both complement pathways. Hyperbolic relationships were observed for C6 and C6des-FIMs for the Classical Pathway, and only a small time lag for hemolysis mediated by C6des-FIMs relative to C6 was observed. In contrast for the Alternative Pathway, both C6 and C6 C6des-FIMs showed sigmoidal kinetics, and an appreciable time lag was observed for hemolysis mediated by C6des-FIMs relative to C6 (Fig. 5). Since this result suggested that the half-life of metastable C5b* may be longer when generated by the Alternative Pathway than when made by the Classical Pathway, the half-lives of nascent C5b* after formation by both complement pathways were determined. This was accomplished by producing nascent C5b* on either rabbit erythrocytes for the Alternative Pathway or sheep EAC1 for the Classical Pathway, followed by measuring decay of hemolytic potential after incubation at 37 °C. The results shown in Fig. 6 indicate that the Classical Pathway C5b* is very labile, decaying with a half-live of 2.4 min at 37 °C, whereas that of the Alternative Pathway is considerably more stable and decays with a half-life of 30.3 min at 37 °C. Consistently, the rate of dissociation from erythrocytes of125I-C5b deposited by the Alternative Pathway (t12=23.8 min) was considerably slower than that deposited by the Classical Pathway (t12=4.9 min) (Fig. 7). Furthermore, although similar amounts of cells, C5-, and C6-deficient plasma were used to activate both pathways, at 0 time over 10-fold more 125I-C5b was found on erythrocytes which were used to activate the Alternative Pathway than those used to activate the Classical Pathway (Fig. 7).Figure 7The rate of dissociation of125I-C5b generated by the Alternative or Classical Pathways. Rabbit erythrocytes (Alternative Pathway) or sheep EAC1 (Classical Pathway) were preincubated briefly at 37 °C with a plasma depleted of C6 containing 125I-C5. Afterward the cells were centrifuged, washed once, and subsequently incubated at 37 °C in DGVB/EDTA. At various times aliquots were removed, and the cells were centrifuged through oil. The bottoms of the tubes were cut, and the cell pellets were counted for radioactivity. Corrections were made for background binding of 125I-C5 to these cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since at the onset of this experiment a much higher level of125I-C5b was found on rabbit erythrocytes than sensitized sheep erythrocytes, we hypothesized that cells, which were used to activate the Alternative Pathway, bound more C3b than those used to activate the Classical Pathway. To examine this, we measured the amount of C3b molecules bound to each cell type after incubation with plasma depleted of C6 containing 125I-labeled C3 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The outcome was that rabbit cells bound 1.77 ± 0.05 × 106 C3b/cell but sheep erythrocytes bound only 2.95 ± 0.17 × 105C3b/cell. These results along with the relative decay rates of C5b and C5b hemolytic potential suggested that bound C3b could stabilize metastable C5b*. To test this notion further, we designed hemolytic assays using isolated Classical Pathway proteins (C2–9), and we examined the influence of the complement control proteins H and I on the hemolytic activities of both C6 and C6des-FIMs. The results, shown in Fig.8, indicated that the specific hemolytic activities of C6 and C6des-FIMs are diminished by factors H and I but that of C6des-FIMs is more severely impacted. In the absence of the complement control proteins, the percent activity of C6des-FIMs to C6 is about 15%, but with increasing concentration of these regulatory proteins, this value declines to 1%. The combined results suggest that optimal hemolytic activity of C6des-FIMs requires more cell bound C3b than does C6, which is consistent with the notion that C3b could stabilize metastable C5b*. The binding capability of the various forms of C6 for interaction with C5 was measured next. The results show that interaction of C5 with C6 is ionic strength-dependent, and that removal of the FIMs from this protein drastically reduces the capacity of C5 to interact with C6 (Fig. 9). Relative to human serum albumin, C6des-FIMs did have a weak capacity to bind C5, but full-length C6 was clearly stronger. In order to obtain quantitative data for the interaction of C5 with C6, binding studies were performed using unlabeled C5 in competition with trace-labeled125I-labeled C5. Scatchard analyses indicated that the affinities of C5 for C6 were 2.3 and 0.93 × 106m−1 in 0.075 m NaCl and 0.15m NaCl, respectively (Fig.10).Figure 10The affinity of C5 for C6. Top, increasing concentrations of C5 were allowed to compete with 125I-labeled C5 for binding immobilized C6 in buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl (white circles) or 0.075m NaCl (black circles). Each point represents the mean value from three different determinations. Binding is expressed as percent of the maximum observed.

Both C5b-6 and C5b-6des-FIMs were produced in the fluid phase, and functional equivalents of these were assayed for activity after exposure to various concentrations of sodium chloride or sodium thiocyanate. The results were that C5b-6 and C5b-6des-FIMS exhibited nearly identical profiles of stability to concentrated solutions of sodium chloride and instability to small concentrations of sodium thiocyanate (Fig. 11). The data presented here suggest that the coupling of C5"
https://openalex.org/W1976609981,"Mono-ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification in which the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD is transferred to an acceptor protein, is catalyzed by a family of amino acid-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases. ADP-ribosyltransferase 5 (ART5), a murine transferase originally isolated from Yac-1 lymphoma cells, differed in properties from previously identified eukaryotic transferases in that it exhibited significant NAD glycohydrolase (NADase) activity. To investigate the mechanism of regulation of transferase and NADase activities, ART5 was synthesized as a FLAG fusion protein inEscherichia coli. Agmatine was used as the ADP-ribose acceptor to quantify transferase activity. ART5 was found to be primarily an NADase at 10 μm NAD, whereas at higher NAD concentrations (1 mm), after some delay, transferase activity increased, whereas NADase activity fell. This change in catalytic activity was correlated with auto-ADP-ribosylation and occurred in a time- and NAD concentration-dependent manner. Based on the change in mobility of auto-ADP-ribosylated ART5 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the modification appeared to be stoichiometric and resulted in the addition of at least two ADP-ribose moieties. Auto-ADP-ribosylated ART5 isolated after incubation with NAD was primarily a transferase. These findings suggest that auto-ADP-ribosylation of ART5 was stoichiometric, resulted in at least two modifications and converted ART5 from an NADase to a transferase, and could be one mechanism for regulating enzyme activity. Mono-ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification in which the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD is transferred to an acceptor protein, is catalyzed by a family of amino acid-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases. ADP-ribosyltransferase 5 (ART5), a murine transferase originally isolated from Yac-1 lymphoma cells, differed in properties from previously identified eukaryotic transferases in that it exhibited significant NAD glycohydrolase (NADase) activity. To investigate the mechanism of regulation of transferase and NADase activities, ART5 was synthesized as a FLAG fusion protein inEscherichia coli. Agmatine was used as the ADP-ribose acceptor to quantify transferase activity. ART5 was found to be primarily an NADase at 10 μm NAD, whereas at higher NAD concentrations (1 mm), after some delay, transferase activity increased, whereas NADase activity fell. This change in catalytic activity was correlated with auto-ADP-ribosylation and occurred in a time- and NAD concentration-dependent manner. Based on the change in mobility of auto-ADP-ribosylated ART5 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the modification appeared to be stoichiometric and resulted in the addition of at least two ADP-ribose moieties. Auto-ADP-ribosylated ART5 isolated after incubation with NAD was primarily a transferase. These findings suggest that auto-ADP-ribosylation of ART5 was stoichiometric, resulted in at least two modifications and converted ART5 from an NADase to a transferase, and could be one mechanism for regulating enzyme activity. glycosylphosphatidylinositol NAD glycohydrolase ADP-ribosyltransferase 5 cytotoxic T cells glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Tris-buffered saline Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Mono-ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification of proteins catalyzed by enzymes that transfer the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD to specific amino acids in protein acceptors (1Ueda K. Hayaishi O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 73-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 2Williamson K.C. Moss J. Moss J. Vaughan M. ADP-ribosylating Toxins and G Proteins: Insights into Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1990: 493-510Google Scholar). The best characterized mono-ADP-ribosylation reactions are those catalyzed by bacterial toxin ADP-ribosyltransferases such as cholera (3Moss J. Vaughan M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 303-379PubMed Google Scholar), diphtheria (4Collier R.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. ADP-ribosylating Toxins and G Proteins: Insights into Signal Transduction.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1990: 45-77Google Scholar) toxins, which alter critical metabolic and regulatory pathways. For example, cholera toxin ADP-ribosylates an arginine in the α-subunit of the stimulatory heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein), resulting in the activation of adenylyl cyclase and an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP (3Moss J. Vaughan M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 303-379PubMed Google Scholar). Mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity specific for arginine has been detected in numerous animal tissues (2Williamson K.C. Moss J. Moss J. Vaughan M.

DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Based on immunological, biochemical, and sequence analysis, it appears that the transferase, termed ART1, is glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)1-anchored to the cell surface (8Okazaki I.J. Zolkiewska A. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12828-12836Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Okazaki I.J. Kim H.-J. McElvaney G. Lesma E. Moss J. Blood. 1996; 88: 915-921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with its extracellular location, a GPI-linked muscle transferase in C2C12 mouse myotubes ADP-ribosylates integrin α7 (17Zolkiewska A. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25273-25276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitor studies suggest that the muscle transferase may participate in the regulation of myogenesis (18Kharadia S.V. Huiatt T.W. Huang H.-Y. Peterson J.E. Graves D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). GPI-anchored transferases were found also in mouse cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and some murine T cell lymphoma and hybridoma cells. Treatment of CTL with NAD inhibited target conjugate formation and cytolytic function (19Wang J. Nemoto E. Kots A.Y. Kaslow H.R. Dennert G. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4048-4058PubMed Google Scholar). These suppressive effects of NAD on CTL were prevented by treatment of the cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, which releases GPI-linked proteins from the cell surface, consistent with the conclusion that a GPI-anchored ADP-ribosyltransferase was responsible for modulating CTL function. Further study (20Wang J. Nemoto E. Dennert G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2819-2827PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that ecto-NAD served as the substrate for ADP-ribosylation of a 40-kDa CTL membrane protein (p40) that modulates tyrosine kinase activity of p56lck, thereby suppressing CD8-mediated transmembrane signaling. Release of the membrane-bound transferase with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C prevented the NAD-induced inhibition of kinase activity. Rat RT6 and mouse Rt6 are another family of GPI-anchored ADP-ribosyltransferase expressed on T lymphocytes (21Prochazka M. Gaskins H.R. Leiter E.H. Koch-Nolte F. Haag F. Thiele H.-G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9420-9423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and auto-ADP-ribosyltransferase activities (24Rigby M.R. Bortell R. Stevens L.A. Moss J. Kanaitsuka T. Shigeta H. Mordes J.P. Greiner D.L. Rossini A.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4259-4265PubMed Google Scholar) but does not ADP-ribosylate free arginine. Unlike the rat RT6 proteins, mouse Rt6–1 is primarily a transferase, with a relatively low level of NADase activity (25Moss J. Stevens L.A. Cavanaugh E. Okazaki I.J. Bortell R. Kanaitsuka T.

The differences between RT6 and Rt6 appear to result from the presence of glutamine or glutamate, respectively, at the active site (26Hara N. Tsuchiya M. Shimoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29552-29555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Maehama T. Hoshino S. Takada T.

Blood. 1996; 88: 915-921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Yac-2 (13Okazaki I.J. Kim H.-J. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22052-22057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), were cloned from mouse lymphoma (Yac-1) cells. Yac-1, a GPI-linked exoenzyme, is the murine equivalent of ART1 and exhibits 75 and 77% similarity of amino acid sequence to the rabbit and human muscle enzymes, respectively. In contrast to ART1 transferase, ART5, although membrane-associated, is apparently not GPI-anchored. The hydrophobicity profile includes a hydrophobic signal sequence at the N terminus but not at the C terminus, as would be expected in a GPI-linked protein. To that extent, it is similar to a secreted protein and resembles a chicken transferase found in heterophil granules (9Tsuchiya M. Hara N. Yamada K. Osago H. Shimoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27451-27457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ART5 is also of interest because it exhibits significant basal NADase activity. Here we report that ART5 transferase activity is modified by auto-ADP-ribosylation.

The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with XhoI and BglII and then subcloned into a pFLAG-MAC expression vector that was used to transformEscherichia coli DH5α competent cells. Transformed E. coli DH5α cells were grown to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.4 in 500 ml of LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin before isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added (final concentration, 0.3 mm), and incubation was continued for another 2 h at 30 °C. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation (15 min, 5,000 × g, 4 °C) and frozen at −80 °C. After thawing on ice, cells were suspended in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl containing protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin, each 1 μg/ml), incubated for 30 min on ice and sonicated (20 s × 3). The lysate was centrifuged (12,500 × g, 40 min); the supernatant was filtered (0.45-μm filter, Millipore) and concentrated ∼4-fold. The concentrated sample (∼5 ml) was incubated with 1% Triton X-100 overnight then applied to an Ultrogel AcA 44 column (2.5 × 108 cm), equilibrated, and eluted with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 1 mmEDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. Fractions containing maximal enzyme activity were pooled and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel for 16 h at 4 °C. The gel was washed four times with 12 ml of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), before elution of ART5 fusion protein with TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide. The protein was stored at −80 °C. Nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis were incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk in 20 mmTris (pH 7.6), containing 137 mm NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T), before incubation with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody diluted to 100 μg/ml with the same solution containing 3% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were washed with TBS-T once for 15 min and twice for 5 min, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugate anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:1000 in TBS-T containing 3% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. After one 15-min wash and four 5-min washes with TBS-T, immunoreactive proteins were detected by chemiluminescence. ADP-ribosyltransferase assays were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in a total volume of 300 μl containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 20 mm agmatine, and 0.1 mm[adenine-U-14C]NAD (0.05 μCi). Samples (100 μl) were applied to columns (0.5 × 4 cm) of Dowex AG1-X2, and [14C]ADP-ribosylagmatine was eluted with 5 ml of water for liquid scintillation counting. The NADase and transferase reactions were carried out in 300 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mm [carbonyl-14C]NAD (0.05 μCi) with (i.e. transferase and NADase) or without (i.e.NADase) 20 mm agmatine. After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, samples (100 μl) were applied to columns (0.5 × 4 cm) of Dowex AG1-X2. [14C]Nicotinamide was eluted with 5 ml of water for liquid scintillation counting. Purified ART5 (30 ng) was incubated in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) with 1 mm [adenylate-32P]NAD (6 μCi/assay) in a total volume of 100 μl at 30 °C. In a parallel experiment, purified ART5 (160 ng) was incubated in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) with 1 mm[adenine-U-14C]NAD (0.8 μCi/assay) or [carbonyl-14C]NAD (0.8 μCi/assay) in a total volume of 1.6 ml at 30 °C. At 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 7 h, and 8 h, 50 μl (duplicate) of enzyme reaction solutions were used to measure transferase and NADase activities; 25 μl of ice-cold 100% trichloroacetic acid were added to 100 μl of ADP-ribosylation reaction mixture. Samples were placed on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation (10,000 × g) at 4 °C for 30 min, protein was separated by SDS-PAGE in 12% gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were exposed to film. Purified ART5 (30 ng) was incubated in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) with 1, 5, 20, 100, 300, 1000, 3000, or 10,000 μm[adenylate-32P]NAD (6 μCi/assay) in a total volume of 100 μl at 30 °C for 1 h. Reactions were stopped by adding 25 μl of ice-cold 100% trichloroacetic acid to 100 μl of the reaction mixture and kept on ice for 1 h before centrifugation (10,000 × g) at 4 °C, for 30 min. Proteins were dissolved in 1 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE in 12% gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were then exposed to film. In a parallel experiment, purified ART5 (10 ng) was incubated in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) with 1, 5, 20, 100, 300, 1000, 3000, or 10000 μm [adenine-U-14C]NAD (0.025 μCi/assay) or [carbonyl-14C]NAD (0.025 μCi/assay) in a total volume of 150 μl at 30 °C for 1 h. At the time point, 50 μl (duplicate) of enzyme reaction solutions were used to measure transferase and NADase activities. Purified ART5 fusion protein (about 400 ng) was incubated in 50 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.5) with 0, 10, 100, or 1000 μm32P-NAD (24 μCi/assay) in a final volume of 600 μl at 30 °C for 1 h and 8 h. At the time point, free NAD was removed from the protein solution by chromatography × 2 on PD-10 columns, equilibrated, and eluted with TBS; NADase activity and radioactivity were measured in fractions. The second pooled peak protein fractions contained about 68% of the applied protein and <0.02% of the free NAD. Transferase and NADase activities of the ADP-ribosylated protein were measured in the presence of 100 μm NAD with or without 20 mm agmatine. To quantify ADP-ribosylated protein, immunoblotting was performed. To determine whether the proteins were ADP-ribosylated, they were resolved by SDS-PAGE in 12% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for autoradiography and immunoblotting. Purified ART5 (∼1.8 μg) was incubated in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) with and without 1000 μm NAD (final volume, 2.5 ml) at 30 °C for 1 h. At the time point, free NAD was separated from protein by chromatography × 2 on PD-10 columns, equilibrated and eluted with TBS. Transferase and NADase activities were measured for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence of 100, 200, 300, 600, 1000, and 3000 μm NAD with or without 20 mm agmatine. 3 μg of partially purified ART1, and 30 ng of purified ART5 were incubated in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) with 0.1 mmof either [carbonyl-14C]NAD (35 mCi/mmol), [adenine-U-14C]NAD (supplied as 252 mCi/mmol and diluted with unlabeled NAD to 35 mCi/mmol), or [adenylate-32P]NAD (6 μCi/assay). 30 μg of GAPDH was incubated with the radiolabeled NAD, with or without 1 mm sodium nitroprusside. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. Protein was precipitated with the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 20%) and, following incubation at 4 °C overnight, was collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min). The pellet was suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated in boiling water for 5 min. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE (4–20% gel). Gels with labeled ART1 and GAPDH were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried. Gels with labeled ART5 were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. X-Omat films were exposed to gels or membranes with32P-labeled protein at −80 °C for 48 h. X-Omat films were exposed to gels or membranes with 14C-labeled protein at −80 °C for 120 days. Purified ART5 (about 5 μg), eluted with TBS containing FLAG peptide (200 μl/ml), was concentrated and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with or without 1 mm NAD (final volume, 0.5 ml). Electrospray mass spectroscopy was performed with a Hewlett-Packard model G1946A instrument interfaced to a model 1100 high pressure liquid chromatography system equipped with a Vydac 218TP narrow bore C18 column (218TP5205, Vydac, Hesperia, CA). The initial solvent was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, and gradient elution was effected with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/acetronitrile at 2%/min and a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The effluent from the column was mixed in a tee with neat acetic acid delivered by another 1100 series pump (100 μl/min), and the mixture was introduced into the mass spectrometer (28Apffel A. Fischer S. Goldberg G. Goodley P.C. Kuhlmann F.E. J. Chromator. A. 1995; 712: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Purified ART5 fusion protein (180 ng) was incubated in 50 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.5) with 1 mm[adenylate-32P]NAD (36 μCi/assay) in a total volume of 600 μl at 30 °C. After ADP-ribosylation for 1 h or 8 h, protein was precipitated with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 20%) and dissolved in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Chemical stability of ADP-ribose-protein linkage was determined by incubation of protein for 2 h at 37 °C with H2O, 1 m NaCl, 0.1 m HCl, 0.1 m NaOH, 10 mm HgCl2, or 1 m NH2OH (in 0.1 m Tris, adjusted to pH 7.0 with NH4OH). Protein was precipitated with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, subjected to SDS-PAGE in 12% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for autoradiography and immunoblotting. Protein was determined using either BCA protein assay reagent or silver staining with bovine serum albumin as standard. ART5 FLAG fusion protein was purified ∼4500-fold from E. colicell lysate supernatant with a recovery of approximately 17% in a two-step procedure. Data from a typical purification are summarized in Table I. Enzyme purity was confirmed by silver staining. SDS-PAGE in 4–20% gels under reducing conditions revealed a single band of about 34 kDa in the lane containing 10 ng of purified ART5 (Fig. 1). Transferase and NADase activities of the purified protein are shown in Table II. In the presence of 100 μm NAD, NADase activity was approximately eight times that of transferase.Table ISummary of purification of ART5 FLAG-fusion proteinStepProteinTotal activitySpecific activityRecoveryPurificationμgpmol · min−1pmol · min−1· μg−1%foldSupernatant40,0005,2000.131001Ultrogel AcA 441,9502,8001.55511Anti-FLAG gel1.5870580174,500Purification is described under “Experimental Procedures.” Activity is pmol ADP-ribosylagmatine formed per min per μg of ART5 fusion protein.

Transferase activity of ART5 was assayed in 300 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mm [adenine-U-14C]NAD (∼87,000 cpm) with or without 20 mm agmatine for 1 h at 30 °C.

During incubation with NAD, the transferase and NADase activities of ART5 changed dramatically. These effects were investigated systematically by varying the NAD concentration and time. As shown in Fig. 2, during incubation at 30 °C with 1 mm NAD as substrate, NADase activity was initially much greater than transferase, but by 1 h, almost ceased. Transferase activity, first detected after 30 min, was constant thereafter for 3 h and then declined somewhat. After 1 h of incubation with 1 mm NAD, ART5 had in effect changed from an NADase to a transferase. To determine whether NAD itself was the cause, purified ART5 fusion protein was incubated with 1 mmnicotinamide, ADP-ribose, or NAD, for 1 h at 30 °C before assay. Incubation of ART5 with nicotinamide or ADP-ribose prior to assay did not change the relative transferase and NADase activities (data not shown). Only incubation with NAD enhanced transferase and decreased NADase activities. In assays for 1 h at 30 °C, transferase activity was essentially undetectable with 1–20 μm NAD (Fig. 3). The ratio of NADase to transferase activity was about 8 with 100 μmNAD, 1.8 with 1000 μm NAD, and 1 with 10 mmNAD. Because ART5 is auto-ADP-ribosylated, we postulated that the decrease in NADase and increase in transferase activities in a manner dependent on time and NAD concentration resulted from the auto-modification.Figure 3Effect of NAD concentration on ADP-ribosyltransferase and NADase activities of ART5 FLAG fusion protein. Purified ART5 (10 ng) was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) with the indicated concentration of [adenine-U-14C]NAD or [carbonyl-14C]NAD (0.025 μCi/assay) in a total volume of 150 μl. Transferase activity (stippled bars), NADase activity (open bars), and nicotinamide release in the presence of 20 mm agmatine (black bars) are expressed as nmol/min/μg of ART5. Data are the means ± S.E. of values from two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To define better the properties of the ADP-ribosylated protein, ART5 was incubated with 10, 100, or 1000 μm NAD for 1 h or 8 h followed by removal of NAD from the ADP-ribosylated protein and assay of transferase and NADase activities. Activities were not significantly changed after incubation without NAD for 1 h but were lower after 8 h. Following incubation with NAD, transferase activity increased, whereas NADase activity decreased. Incubation with 100 μm or 1 mm NAD for 1 or 8 h decreased ART5 NADase activity and increased transferase activity significantly, whereas 10 μm NAD was ineffective. NADase activity was decreased about 95%, and transferase activity was doubled after incubation with 1 mm NAD for 8 h (Fig. 4). When assayed with 10 μm NAD, the transferase activity of ART5 that had been incubated with 1 mm NAD was 3.8-fold that of control, whereas the NADase activity was 2% of control (Fig.5). The increased loss of NADase activity associated with increasing concentrations of NAD present during the 8-h incubation was also observed when assays were carried out with 100 μm or 1 mm NAD, but the concomitant increase in transferase activity was much less evident (Fig. 5). In sum, however, the data are consistent with the conclusion that ART5 NADase activity is decreased by auto-ADP-ribosylation.Figure 5ADP-ribosyltransferase and NADase activities of ADP-ribosylated ART5 FLAG fusion protein assayed at different NAD concentrations. Purified ART5 was incubated with indicated NAD concentrations for 8 h. After separation of NAD from the protein as in Fig. 4, samples of ART5 (∼10 ng) were assayed for transferase activity (stippled bars), NADase activity (open bars), and nicotinamide release in the presence of 20 mm agmatine (black bars) reported as nmol/min/μg of ART5. Assays were carried out with 10 μm(A), 100 μm (B), and 1000 μm (C) NAD.

A 1-h incubation period was chosen because ART5 was stable at 30 °C during that time. Assay of transferase and NADase activities of ADP-ribosylated and non-ADP-ribosylated ART5 FLAG fusion protein was performed for 1 h at 30 °C. Kinetic constants of ADP-ribosyltransferase and NADase activities, determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots by linear regression analysis, are presented in Table III.

The extracellular domain binds unique small polypeptides with high specificity, which include the endogenous peptide hormones, guanylin and uroguanylin, as well as an exogenous enterotoxigenic peptide, heat-stable enterotoxin, secreted by pathogenic Escherichia coli. Information on this specific binding is propagated into the intracellular domain, followed by the synthesis of cGMP, a second messenger that regulates a variety of intracellular physiological processes. This study reports the design of a photoaffinity labeled analog of heat-stable enterotoxin (biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17)), which incorporates a Pap residue (p-azidophenylalanine) at position 11 and a biotin moiety at the N terminus, and the use of this analog to determine the ligand-binding region of the extracellular domain of guanylyl cyclase C. The endoproteinase Lys-C digestion of the extracellular domain, which was covalently labeled by this ligand, and mass spectrometric analyses of the digest revealed that the ligand specifically binds to the region (residue 387 to residue 393) of guanylyl cyclase C. This region is localized close to the transmembrane portion of guanylyl cyclase C on the external cellular surface. This result was further confirmed by characterization of site-directed mutants of guanylyl cyclase C in which each amino acid residue was substituted by an Ala residue instead of residues normally located in the region. This experiment provides the first direct demonstration of the ligand-binding site of guanylyl cyclase C and will contribute toward an understanding of the receptor recognition of a ligand and the modeling of the interaction of the receptor and its ligand at the molecular level.

It is generally thought that this process is involved in the regulation of intestinal and kidney fluids and electrolytes, via the endogenous peptide hormone, guanylin or uroguanylin (4Currie M.G. Fok K.F. Kato J. Moore R.J. Hamra F.K. Duffin K.L. Smith C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 947-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 5Hamra F.K. Forte L.R. Eber S.L.

It is also noteworthy that GC-C greatly increases cGMP levels in intestinal epithelial cells, on interaction with an exogenous peptide, heat-stable enterotoxin (STa), which is produced by enteric bacteria such as enterotoxigenicEscherichia coli. This results in an efflux of watery electrolytes into the intestinal lumen, which leads to, in turn, acute diarrhea in human and domestic animals (6Dupont H.L. Ericsson C.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1821-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). GC-C is a single subunit protein molecule (1050 residues) with a unique structure consisting of an N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD, ∼407 residues), which is responsible for ligand binding, and a C-terminal intracellular domain (∼619 residues), for the catalysis of cGMP synthesis, which are connected through a single transmembrane polypeptide (∼24 residues) (1Schulz S. Green C.K. Yuen P.S.T. Garbers D.L. Cell. 1990; 63: 941-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 7Singh S. Singh G. Heim J.-M. Gerzer R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Immunol. 1994; 38: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The C-terminal intracellular domain is comprised of two functional regions, a kinase homology region and a guanylyl cyclase catalytic region. The N-terminal domain is structurally specific for a ligand such as guanylin and uroguanylin, and the resulting information is then transferred to the cytoplasmic intracellular domain via the transmembrane polypeptide, resulting in the stimulation of the guanylyl cyclase catalytic region in the intracellular domain. The molecular mechanism for recognizing the structure of a ligand and leading to signal transduction by GC-C currently is unknown, but one plausible scenario is that GC-C induces a change in conformation or topology between each subunit when ligand binding occurs, resulting in the removal of a negative regulatory effect of the kinase homology region on the activation of the guanylyl cyclase catalytic region and, thus, creating a favorable environment for the synthesis of cGMP (9Rudner X.L. Mandel K.K. De Sauvage F.J. Kindman L.A. Almenoff J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5169-5173Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GC-C exists as an oligomer in cultured cells irrespective of the presence or absence of a ligand (9Rudner X.L. Mandel K.K. De Sauvage F.J. Kindman L.A. Almenoff J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5169-5173Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Vaandrager A.B. van der Wiel E. Hom M. Luthjens L.H. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16409-16415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, the ECD molecule forms an oligomer in a ligand-dependent manner (11Hasegawa M. Kawano Y. Matsumoto Y. Hidaka Y. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Wada A. Hirayama T. Shimonishi Y. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the relationship of the oligomeric state of GC-C to the binding to a ligand remains unclear. Studies of the site-directed mutagenesis of porcine GC-C revealed two regions in the ECD that are sensitive to point mutations (12Wada A. Hirayama T. Kitaura H. Fujisawa J. Hasegawa M. Hidaka Y. Shimonishi Y. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5144-5150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); one is a highly conserved region from residue 91 to residue 155 (numbers denote the positions of amino acid residues relative to the N terminus of porcine GC-C) in the amino acid sequences of GC-Cs determined thus far, and the other is in the sequence from residue 274 to residue 409 which is close to the transmembrane portion. A mutation in the region from residue 347 to residue 401 in the latter, which is positioned near the transmembrane portion, causes a significant reduction in both ligand binding activity and guanylyl cyclase catalytic activity. These results suggest that the region on the ECD for interacting with a ligand is focused on or located within these regions, the mutation of which strongly affects the biological properties of GC-C. We describe herein the identification of the specific region on the ECD of porcine GC-C bound to a ligand. For defining the region on the ECD that confronts a ligand, we designed and synthesized a photoaffinity labeling analog of STa (biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17)) (Fig. 1) with a Pap residue (p-azido-l-phenylalanine) at position 11 and a biotin moiety at the N terminus. This analog of STa would be expected to undergo UV-induced binding to the ECD, and a peptide fragment bound to this analog could then be salvaged from the enzymatic digest of the photoaffinity labeled ECD by using an avidin-immobilized matrix. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to map a peptide on ECD for biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17), which has been specifically limited to the amino acid sequence from residue 387 to residue 393, close to the transmembrane portion. This finding was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis because substitution by an Ala residue for Thr-389, Phe-390, or Trp-392 in the sequence, respectively, greatly affects binding ability to the ligand, as well as cyclase catalytic activity of GC-C. These results provide novel insights into the elucidation of the recognition and activation mechanism of GC-C by a ligand. The reagents used for peptide synthesis were purchased from the Peptide Institute Inc. (Minoh, Japan) and Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan).

Other reagents and solvents were purchased from Sigma and Katayama Chemicals Inc. (Osaka, Japan), all of which were reagent grade. Peptides were synthesized using standard solid-phase procedures usingtert-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry (13Aimoto S. Watanabe H. Ikemura H. Shimonishi Y. Takeda T. Takeda Y. Miwatani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 112: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). STp(4–17) and ANB-STp(4–17) were synthesized as described previously (14Kubota H. Hidaka Y. Ozaki H. Ito H. Hirayama T. Takeda Y. Shimonishi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Details of the procedures for synthesis of [Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17) in which the amino acid residues at positions 4 and 11 of STp(4–17) were replaced by Gly and Pap, respectively, that is synthesis of intermediates, protection of the functional side chains of amino acid residues, removal of peptides from the resin, conversion from linear forms of peptides to their oxidized forms, conversion ofp-amino-l-phenylalanine to Pap, and purification of peptides on reversed-phase HPLC were as described previously (15Hasegawa M. Kawano Y. Matsumoto K. Hidaka Y. Sato T. Shimonishi Y. Lett. Peptide Sci. 1997; 4: 1-11Google Scholar). In the final step of the synthesis, the biotin group was attached to the N terminus of [Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17) by the following procedure: [Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17) (100 nmol) was mixed with biotinyl-(AC5)2-OSu (Dojin Chemical Inc., Kumamoto, Japan) and triethylamine (50 eq each of the amount of the peptide) in N,N-dimethylformamide (200 μl). After standing for 2 h at room temperature, the reaction product (biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17)) was isolated by reversed-phase HPLC. The binding activity of biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17) to GC-C was determined by a competitive inhibition assay involving the binding of [125I-Tyr4]STp(4–17), as described in a previous paper (11Hasegawa M. Kawano Y. Matsumoto Y. Hidaka Y. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Wada A. Hirayama T. Shimonishi Y. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of ECD6H (ECD with a hexahistidine sequence attached to the C terminus) from Sf21 insect cells were carried out according to methods described in an earlier report (11Hasegawa M. Kawano Y. Matsumoto Y. Hidaka Y. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Wada A. Hirayama T. Shimonishi Y. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). That is the recombinant baculovirus carrying the cDNA of ECD6H was infected into Sf21 insect cells (5 × 107, 80% confluent state) in a 175-cm2 flask for 1 h. The infected cells were cultured for an additional 2 days in spinner flasks (5 × 105 cells/ml). The culture supernatant (1200 ml) was treated batchwise with 10-ml bed volumes of concanavalin A-immobilized agarose. The concanavalin A-agarose was filtered and washed with buffer A (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2) (50 ml). The adsorbed protein was eluted with buffer A (50 ml) containing 500 mmα-methyl-d-mannoside. The non-adsorbed fraction was treated repeatedly by the same procedure, and the eluted fractions were pooled. The eluate was concentrated to 20 ml using an Ultrafiltration Cell (Amicon Inc., MA). The solution contained about 800 pmol of the purified ECD6H. The resulting purified ECD6H was mixed with biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17) (100 nmol) and stored at 37 °C in the dark for 1 h. The solution was then exposed to UV irradiation (302 nm, model UVM-57, UVP Inc., CA) for 30 min on ice. After the photoaffinity labeling, the labeled protein was separated from excess ligand and extraneous materials by using Ni2+-chelating affinity chromatography according to the procedure described in Ref. 11Hasegawa M. Kawano Y. Matsumoto Y. Hidaka Y. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Wada A. Hirayama T. Shimonishi Y. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar. Tris was added into the reaction mixture as a scavenger to inhibit nonspecific cross-linking reaction as well as serve as a buffer for the reaction solution (16Bayley H. Knowles J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 46: 69-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 17Eberle A.N. de Graan P.N.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 129-156Crossref Google Scholar). These purification procedures yielded about 260 pmol of the labeled ECD6H, based on the starting crude ECD6H (800 pmol), as judged from the ligand-binding capacity of the ECD6H treated without photoaffinity labeling (control experiments). The solution that contained the photoaffinity labeled ECD6H, described above, was directly diluted with 1 ml of buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 9.0) and 8 m urea) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The solution was then diluted with 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 9.0) (5 ml) containing 0.01% SDS and concentrated to 0.5 ml on a Centricon-10 (Amicon Inc.). Peptide N-glycosidase F (0.4 units) was added to the solution for removal of carbohydrate chains at the N-linked glycosylation sites and allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 2 h. The resulting solution was then incubated with endoproteinase Lys-C (3 μg) at 37 °C for 16 h. The above digested ECD6H solution was mixed with avidin-immobilized agarose (50-μl bed volume) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The avidin-immobilized agarose was collected on an Ultrafree-MC 0.1 μm filter unit (Millipore Inc.). The agarose was washed twice with 100 mm Tris (pH 9.0) (300 μl) containing 100 mmNaCl and then with sufficient 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid to remove salts. The peptides were removed from the agarose by heating in a mixture of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile at 100 °C for 15 min. The supernatant, which contained the peptides, was concentrated in vacuo and subjected to mass measurements with an Voyager Elite-XL MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Japan PerSpective Biosystems, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. The preparation of the constructs of the recombinant GC-C and its mutant proteins was carried out according to procedures reported previously (12Wada A. Hirayama T. Kitaura H. Fujisawa J. Hasegawa M. Hidaka Y. Shimonishi Y. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5144-5150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. These recombinant proteins were transiently expressed in 293T human embryonic kidney cells, which were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, using the Superfect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's specifications (Qiagen). Briefly, the 1.0-kilobase pair cDNA fragment between the KpnI andHindIII sites was isolated from pCG-STaR. The cDNA fragment was subcloned into pBluescript and used as a template for the PCR reaction as follows. The first PCR fragment was prepared by using a universal primer (M13–20) and sense primers for the mutation (CCGGTGGATAAGG*C*CCCCACATTCATC for S387A; GTGGATAAGAGCG*CCACATTCATCTGG for P388A; GATAAGAGCCCCG*CC*TTCATCTGGAAG for T389A; AAGAGCCCCACAG*C*CATCTGGAAGAAC for F390A; AGCCCCACATTCG*C*CTGGAAGAACCAC for I391A; CCCACATTCGCCG*C*GAAGAACCACAAA for W392A: asterisks indicate position of the mutated nucleotides), and the second PCR fragment was prepared by another universal primer (M13 reverse) and the antisense primers. The third PCR fragment was constructed with the universal primers (M13–20 and M13 reverse) using the first and second PCR fragments as templates. The third PCR fragment was digested withKpnI and HindIII in order to subclone to theXbaI/HindIII sites of pBluescript SK(−) together with the cDNA fragment between the XbaI andKpnI sites. These fragments were individually inserted into the pCG vector. The vectors were ligated with a 1.7-kilobase pair cDNA fragment that encodes for the C-terminal portion of porcine GC-C with HindIII sites at both ends. The DNA sequences of the vectors constructed in this study were confirmed by an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA Sequencing System using an ABI PRISM Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer). cGMP production of the mutant proteins of GC-C, expressed on 293T cells, was assayed as described previously (8Wada A. Hirayama T. Kitao S. Fujisawa J. Hidaka Y. Shimonishi Y. Microbiol. Immunol. 1994; 38: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Specifically, the 293 cell membranes, which expressed the mutant proteins, were mixed with STp(4–17) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the cells were then rapidly frozen at −80 °C and thawed at room temperature. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm (18,500 × g) for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was extracted three times with water-saturated ether. The cGMP concentration was determined by a radioimmunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's specifications (YAMASA, Chiba, Japan). Other related assays have been described in an earlier paper (18Hasegawa M. Hidaka Y. Wada A. Hirayama T. Shimonishi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 236: 338-345Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A novel STa analog (biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17), Fig. 1) was synthesized as a probe for mining a peptide fragment that encompasses the ligand-binding site on the ECD of GC-C. The synthetic ligand contained two functional residues as follows: one was a photosensitive amino acid (Pap) with azido group, which is easily converted to nitrene by radiation with UV light (300 nm) and covalently anchored to electron-rich groups such as N-H, O-H, etc. on the receptor molecule (17Eberle A.N. de Graan P.N.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 129-156Crossref Google Scholar); and the other was a biotinyl moiety, which noncovalently binds to avidin with an extremely high affinity (K d , 10−15m) and is widely used as a carrier in purification of proteins using avidin-based affinity chromatography. This synthetic compound was confirmed not only to have the same conformation as that of STp(4–17) by comparison of their CD spectra but also to be activated by UV radiation, showing it to be useful as a ligand for ECD. In addition, this ligand was confirmed to be efficiently adsorbed on avidin-immobilized agarose and easily removed from the avidin-agarose by heating at 100 °C for 10 min (data not shown). To confirm whether biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17) can sufficiently bind to ECD6H, we examined the binding activity of biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17) to ECD6H using a competitive ligand binding assay in the presence of a constant amount of [125I-Tyr4]STp(4–17). Fig. 2 shows the competitive binding curves in the binding equilibrium between ECD6H and biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17) or STp(4–17) with IC50 values of 8 × 10−7 and 2 × 10−8m, respectively, indicating that the binding potency of biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17) to ECD6H is 40-fold lower than that of STp(4–17). Previous experiments demonstrated that [Pap11]STp(4–17), in which a Pap residue was introduced at position 11 in STp(4–17), retained a high efficiency of photoaffinity labeling to GC-C, although it diminished the binding potency to GC-C to a level about 30-fold lower than that of STp(4–17) (15Hasegawa M. Kawano Y. Matsumoto K. Hidaka Y. Sato T. Shimonishi Y. Lett. Peptide Sci. 1997; 4: 1-11Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded that biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17) has the same level of the binding potency as [Pap11]STp(4–17) and is a good probe for the efficient photoaffinity labeling of ECD6H. On the basis of the finding shown in Fig. 2, we determined that the optimum concentration of the ligand for a photoaffinity labeling experiment is 5 × 10−6m. UV radiation of the purified ECD6H in the dark, in the presence of biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17), resulted in extensive and irreversible binding of the ligand to ECD6H. Approximately 50% of the ECD6H was occupied with the ligand, and the remaining 50% was free, in comparison with the ECD6H treated under the same conditions except for the absence of biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17) (data not shown). This suggested that half of the ECD6H was involved in cross-linking with biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17). The photoaffinity labeled ECD6H was treated with peptideN-glycosidase F for removal of carbohydrate moieties and then digested with endoproteinase Lys-C. The digest was passed through a column of the avidin-immobilized matrix to adsorb the photoaffinity labeled peptide fragments, which were then removed from the avidin-immobilized matrix by heating. The eluate from the avidin matrix was analyzed by direct MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Fig.3 shows a typical mass spectrum of the eluate from the avidin-immobilized matrix. The mass values of two major signals, observed at m/z = 878.6 and 2716.4, were in complete agreement with the calculated mass values for the peptide fragment (residue 387 to residue 393) of ECD (calculated mass value for SPTFIWK, 878.5) and the same peptide fragment bound to biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4, Pap11]STp(4–17) (calculated mass value for SPTFIWK + biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17), 2716.1), respectively. Moreover, the mass values of the other two signals observed at m/z = 2316.1 and 2430.4 were quite close to the values of PTFI (residue 388 to residue 391) and FIWK (residue 390 to residue 393), bound to biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17) (calculated mass values, 2314.9 and 2430.9, respectively). These fragments could arise via the unexpected cleavage of the labeled peptide, detected at m/z = 2716.4. The mass values of the signals observed in Fig. 3 conform only to peptides that encompass residues 387–393, bound to biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17) but did not fit those of any other sequences (Fig.4). These results are also supported by the observation that the signals (Fig. 3) were not detected in the digest of ECD6H that was treated in the absence of biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17) by the same procedure as that described above (control experiment) (not shown).Figure 4Schematic representation of the ECD of porcine GC-C, displaying the subdomains based on its secondary structure predicted according to the method of Chou and Fasman (26). Vertical bars indicate the location of Cys residues, and the region bound to biotinyl-(AC5)2-[Gly4,Pap11]STp(4–17) is shown by the amino acid sequence, which is compared with those of other species.

The expression of the mutant proteins was confirmed by Western blotting and staining with an anti-GC-C antibody raised against a synthetic peptide covering the C-terminal region (residue 1036 to residue 1050) of porcine GC-C (20Vaandrager A.B. Schulz S. de Jonge H.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2174-2179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 5 A. The recombinant GC-C gave two protein bands on SDS-PAGE (lane 1 in Fig.5 A), in which the heterogeneity of molecular weight of GC-C was likely caused by differences in the extent of N-linked glycosylation, as has been reported previously (20Vaandrager A.B. Schulz S. de Jonge H.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2174-2179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant proteins exhibited two protein bands on SDS-PAGE, which were stained by an antibody detection reagent, similar to the wild type of GC-C (lanes 2–7), suggesting that all the mutant proteins were expressed in the same quantity as that of the wild type GC-C. The mutant proteins were photoaffinity labeled with ANB-[125I-Tyr4]STp(4–17), as shown in Fig.5 B. Among the six mutant proteins, one (S387A) showed a binding potency identical to that of the wild type GC-C. On the contrary, two mutant proteins (P388A and I391A) showed a reduced binding ability, and the remaining three mutant proteins (T389A, F390A, and W392A) were nearly completely devoid of binding ability to ANB-"

TheEscherichia coli form of the enzyme consists of a biotin carboxylase activity, a biotin carboxyl carrier protein, and a carboxyltransferase activity. The C-terminal 87 amino acids of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP87) form a domain that can be independently expressed, biotinylated, and purified (Chapman-Smith, A., Turner, D.

The ability of the biotinylated form of this 87-residue protein (holoBCCP87) to act as a substrate for biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase was assessed and compared with the results with free biotin. In the case of biotin carboxylase holoBCCP87 was an excellent substrate with a Km of 0.16 ± 0.05 mm and Vmax of 1000.8 ± 182.0 min−1.

Stopps J.K. Joshi V.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 537-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase involves two separate reactions shown in Scheme 1. HCO3-+Mg-ATP+Enzyme-Biotin⇌Mg2+Enzyme-Biotin-CO2-+Mg-ADP+PiEnzyme-Biotin-CO2-+Acetyl-CoA⇌Enzyme-Biotin+Malonyl-CoASCHEME 1 Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is composed of three different components which allows it to carry out these two distinct reactions. The biotin carboxylase component catalyzes the first half-reaction which involves the phosphorylation of bicarbonate by ATP to form a carboxyphosphate intermediate, followed by transfer of the carboxyl group to biotin to form carboxybiotin. In vivo, biotin is attached to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (designated as Enzyme-Biotin in Scheme 1) via an amide bond between the valeric acid side chain of biotin and the ε-amino group of a specific lysine residue. In the second reaction, catalyzed by carboxyltransferase, the carboxyl group is transferred from biotin to acetyl-CoA to form malonyl CoA. Animals contain all three of these components on one polypeptide chain (2Tanabe T. Wada K. Okazaki T. Numa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, these three different proteins are on separate polypeptides in the Escherichia coli form of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (3Lane M.D. Moss J. Polakis S.E. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1974; 8: 139-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Each protein of bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase can be isolated, and biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase have been shown to retain activity (4Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Dimroth P. Stoll E. Moss J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6633-6645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, both biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase are able to utilize free biotin as a substrate instead of biotin linked to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein, thereby simplifying kinetic analysis of these two enzymes (4Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Dimroth P. Stoll E. Moss J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6633-6645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As such, the biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase components of E. coliacetyl-CoA carboxylase have long served as model systems for mechanistic studies of biotin-dependent carboxylases. In vivo, however, the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP),1 rather than free biotin, is the natural substrate for biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase. Initial purification procedures of the BCCP revealed two forms. One form was intact BCCP (156 residues), and the other was a 9.1-kDa fragment of BCCP which corresponded to the last 82 residues of BCCP and contained the biotin moiety (5Nervi A.M. Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown that treatment of BCCP with subtilisin Carlsberg produced the 9.1-kDa fragment which was stable, suggesting it was a domain of intact BCCP (6Fall R.R. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2078-2088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the advent of recombinant DNA technology, Chapman-Smithet al. (7Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) developed a system for overexpression of the gene coding for the last 87 residues of the BCCP (BCCP87). Biotinylated (holo) BCCP87 was produced by co-overexpression of the gene for biotin ligase, the enzyme that catalyzes the attachment of biotin to Lys-122 of BCCP and BCCP87. As reported previously, expression of biotin ligase from the co-resident plasmid pCY216, carrying the birA gene under the control of the arabinose promoter, allowed complete biotinylation of overexpressed BCCP87 in vitro in crude cell lysates (7Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). More recently, Nenortas and Beckett showed that apoBCCP87 reacts as well as the apo form of intact BCCP as a substrate for biotin ligase (8Nenortas E. Beckett D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7559-7567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the 9.1-kDa fragment of BCCP has been determined by x-ray crystallography which revealed that the lysine residue to which biotin is attached is located in a turn connecting two β-strands (9Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The biotin moiety hydrogen bonds to a “thumb-like” protrusion of the protein that causes the biotin molecule to be conformationally restricted. The three-dimensional structure of apoBCCP87 determined by NMR spectroscopy shows small conformational differences in the turn containing the biotinylated lysine, with this region having a significantly higher degree of flexibility in the apo protein (10Roberts E. Ningcheng S. Howard M.J. Broadhurst R.W. Chapman-Smith A. Wallace J.C. Morris T. Cronan J.E. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5045-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Yao X. Wei D.

Sci. 1997; 8: 307-317Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Chemical modification and proteolysis studies revealed a subtle overall conformational difference between the apo and holo forms of BCCP87 (13Chapman-Smith A. Forbes B.E. Wallace J.C. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26017-26022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and this has been confirmed recently by NMR experiments which indicate that differences in side chain packing produce a less stable protein prior to biotinylation (10Roberts E. Ningcheng S. Howard M.J. Broadhurst R.W. Chapman-Smith A. Wallace J.C. Morris T. Cronan J.E. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5045-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Despite the considerable amount of work done on the biotin domain of BCCP, it is surprising that it has never been characterized as a substrate for the biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase components of E. coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase. In this note we assess the ability of holoBCCP87 to act as a substrate for biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase. We show that, compared with free biotin, holoBCCP87 increases the catalytic efficiency of biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase 8000- and 2000-fold, respectively. Biotin carboxylase was isolated from a strain of E. coli that overexpresses the gene coding for the enzyme (14Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Purification was accomplished using a histidine-tag attached to the N terminus of the enzyme and nickel affinity chromatography as described previously (14Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Carboxyltransferase was isolated from a strain of E. coli that overexpresses the genes coding for the α and β subunits of carboxyltransferase (15Blanchard C.Z. Waldrop G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19140-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A histidine tag attached to the N terminus of the α subunit allowed for purification using nickel affinity chromatography (14Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The histidine tags on both biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase were found not to affect the activity of the enzymes. Expression and purification of the BCCP87 protein was according to Chapman-Smithet al. (7Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The lyophilized BCCP87 was dissolved in a solution of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 100 mmKCl. The concentration of biotin carboxylase, carboxyltransferase, and the BCCP87 protein was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin (II) as a standard (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar). His-binding resin was from Novagen. Pyruvate kinase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other reagents were from Sigma or Aldrich. The activity of biotin carboxylase was measured by following the production of ADP using the coupling enzymes pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase as described previously (14Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The rate of phosphoryl transfer from carbamyl phosphate to ADP catalyzed by biotin carboxylase was determined spectrophotometrically with the coupling enzymes hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase as described by Blanchard et al. (14Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Values for V and V/K were calculated per active site using a value of 50,000 for the molecular weight of the monomer of biotin carboxylase which exists as a homodimer. The initial velocity of carboxyltransferase was measured in the reverse direction in which the production of acetyl-CoA was coupled to citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase according to Blanchard and Waldrop (15Blanchard C.Z. Waldrop G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19140-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although the number of active sites is not known for carboxyltransferase, we assumed it contained two active sites since the protein is an α2β2 tetramer. Values forV and V/K for carboxyltransferase were calculated per active site using a molecular weight of 68,000 for each αβ dimer. The parameters Km andVmax were determined by fitting the initial velocity versus holoBCCP87 concentration curves to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the nonlinear regression program Enzfitter. The kinetic parameters for the reaction of holoBCCP87 with biotin carboxylase are shown in Table I. The maximal velocity (Vmax) of biotin carboxylase with holoBCCP87 as substrate was 16-fold greater than with biotin as substrate. More significantly, the Michaelis constant (Km) for holoBCCP87 is 530-fold lower than theKm for free biotin. To account for the lowKm for holoBCCP87 in terms of the rate of catalysis the V/K parameter or catalytic efficiency of using biotin versus holoBCCP87 as a substrate is compared. HoloBCCP87 is 8000-fold more efficient as a substrate for biotin carboxylase than is biotin. It is highly significant that theKm for holoBCCP87 was much less than free biotin, because the in vivo concentration of apoBCCP (and by inference holoBCCP) has been estimated to be less than 1 μm (17Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10332-10336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the Km for holoBCCP87 was in the millimolar region, as it is for free biotin, the reaction catalyzed by biotin carboxylase would not occur with a rate fast enough to support cell growth. Moreover, the increasedVmax with holoBCCP87 provides strong support for the phenomenon of substrate-induced synergism exhibited by biotin carboxylase (14Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the absence of biotin, biotin carboxylase will catalyze a bicarbonate-dependent hydrolysis of ATP (18Climent I. Rubio V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The Vmax of this bicarbonate-dependent ATPase reaction is 0.073 min−1 (14Blanchard C.Z. Lee Y.M. Frantom P.A. Waldrop G.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Biotin increased the rate of ATP hydrolysis 860-fold, whereas holoBCCP87 increased ATP hydrolysis almost 14,000-fold. This is very important physiologically because it allows biotin carboxylase to hydrolyze ATP at a significant rate only when the biotin carboxyl carrier protein is present, thereby avoiding a waste of ATP.Table IKinetic parameters for biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferaseSubstrateVmaxKmVmax/Kmmin−1mmmin−1 mm−1Biotin carboxylase Biotin63.0 ± 2.884.8 ± 7.50.74 ± 0.10 BCCP-871000.8 ± 182.00.16 ± 0.056255 ± 3091Carboxyltransferase Biotin14.4 ± 0.36.8 ± 0.42.1 ± 0.2 BCCP-872031.8 ± 231.00.45 ± 0.074515.0 ± 1216.8The Km and Vmax parameters were determined by measuring the initial velocity at increasing amounts of the indicated substrate and then fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation.

The error on V/K was calculated by standard propagation of the errors fromVmax and Km. Biotin carboxylase is known to catalyze the transfer of a phosphoryl group from carbamyl phosphate to ADP to form ATP and carbamic acid, with carbamyl phosphate believed to act as an analog of the carboxyphosphate intermediate in the reaction normally catalyzed by biotin carboxylase (19Polakis S.E. Guchhait R.B. Zwergel E.E. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6657-6667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of phosphoryl transfer is stimulated by biotin, which does not participate in the chemistry of the reaction but presumably induces a conformational change that promotes the reaction (19Polakis S.E. Guchhait R.B. Zwergel E.E. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6657-6667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that holoBCCP87 significantly increased theVmax of biotin carboxylase compared with free biotin, it was of interest to determine whether holoBCCP87 stimulated the phosphoryl transfer reaction of biotin carboxylase. The initial velocity of the phosphoryl transfer reaction was measured in the presence of either biotin or holoBCCP87 and compared with the rate in the absence of these components. The data are shown in Fig.1. The velocity in the presence of 0.05 mm biotin was 3.8-fold greater than in its absence. In contrast, 0.05 mm holoBCCP87 increased the rate 19-fold compared with the control. This was consistent with the observation that the affinity of holoBCCP87 for biotin carboxylase was greater than for free biotin. The other enzymatic activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase is carboxyltransferase, which catalyzes the transfer of the carboxyl group from carboxylated biotin to acetyl-CoA to make malonyl-CoA (Scheme 1, Reaction 2). The interaction of holoBCCP87 with carboxyltransferase was assessed in the nonphysiological direction because holoBCCP87 is a product of the reaction and there is a facile spectrophotometric assay for the reverse reaction (15Blanchard C.Z. Waldrop G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19140-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Km andVmax values for holoBCCP87 and biotin as substrates for carboxyltransferase in the reverse direction are shown in Table I. The maximal velocity for holoBCCP87 was 140-fold higher than the maximal velocity for biotin, whereas the Kmfor holoBCCP87 was 15-fold less than the Km for biotin. Thus, the catalytic efficiency of carboxyltransferase with holoBCCP87 as substrate was 2000-fold greater than with biotin as a substrate. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the magnitude of the changes in the Vmax andKm values for holoBCCP87 compared with biotin was opposite to that seen for the biotin carboxylase reaction. For biotin carboxylase, the Km for holoBCCP87 was 530-fold lower than it was for biotin, whereas the Vmaxwas only 16-fold higher than with biotin. In contrast, for the carboxyltransferase reaction, the Km for holoBCCP87 reaction was only about 15-fold less than biotin, whereas there was a 141-fold increase in the maximal velocity. The difference inKm values suggests that the protein moiety of holoBCCP87 is less significant in binding to carboxyltransferase than it is in binding to biotin carboxylase. The detailed molecular mechanism that allowed holoBCCP87 to react faster with biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase than does free biotin is not known. A pentapeptide derived from the biotin carboxyl carrier protein and containing the biotinylated lysyl residue was found to be a substrate for biotin carboxylase and theV/K value was the same as for free biotin (20Kondo H. Uno S. Moriuchi F. Sunamoto J. Ogushi S. Tsuru D. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1983; 56: 1176-1180Crossref Google Scholar). This suggests that for biotin carboxylase, residues in the biotin carboxyl carrier protein far from the biotinylated lysyl residue are required for the dramatic increase in catalytic efficiency. The lowerKm for holoBCCP87 compared with biotin for biotin carboxylase obviously contributed to the higherV/K value for holoBCCP87. However, the tighter binding of BCCP87 did not inhibit the reaction by creating a large energy barrier for reaching the transition state because the maximal velocity for holoBCCP87 as substrate was greater than free biotin. There could be any number of mechanisms by which holoBCCP87 generates an increase in the maximal velocity of biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the results here for biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase were somewhat similar to those found for CoA transferase (21Jencks W.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Whitty A. Fierke C.A. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11678-11689Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CoA transferase catalyzes the conversion of succinyl-CoA and acetoacetate into succinate and acetoacetyl-CoA. Shorter chain thiols did not accelerate the reaction rate to the same extent as CoA. It was concluded that while the ADP and pantoic acid moieties of CoA were nonreacting portions of the molecule, they were needed for tight binding to the enzyme. The tight binding of CoA to the enzyme then precisely orients the thiol moiety for catalysis. By analogy, most of the protein moiety of holoBCCP87 is far from the site of carboxylation, yet the binding interactions may help to position biotin in the active sites of biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase to allow carboxylation to occur more efficiently. The decrease in conformational flexibility of the biotin-binding region of the holoBCCP87 compared with apoBCCP87 is consistent with this hypothesis (13Chapman-Smith A. Forbes B.E. Wallace J.C.

Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 116: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and bound 32P (19Yamaguchi M. Tonomura Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1979; 86: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have been described previously except that the enzyme (2∼4 mg of protein/ml) was incubated with 50 μl of a pH 7.4 solution containing 25 mm imidazole HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA-Tris, 25 mm sucrose, 2 m NaCl, or changing the concentrations of NaCl to maintain the ionic strength at 2m with choline chloride or 16 mm sodium and 0.43 mm MgCl2 and various concentrations of [γ- or α-32P]ATP and 50 mm[3H]glucose to estimate water space. Approximately 25 μl of the mixture was applied to double membranes, an upper Bio-Rad nitrocellulose membrane with a pore size of 0.45 μm with the lower type AA Millipore filter with a pore size of 0.80 μm under vacuum. After 5∼10 s, the Millipore filters were incubated with 1 ml of a solution containing cold 5 mm ATP-Tris and 50 mm glucose. An aliquot of both the sample and the reaction mixture before filtration was taken and mixed with scintillation mixture and counted. To obtain maximum rubidium occlusion, pig enzyme preparations giving ∼2 nmol of phosphoenzyme/mg of protein were incubated (0.5 mg of protein/ml) with 100 μl of a buffer solution at pH 7.4 containing 25 mm imidazole HCl, 0.1 mmEDTA-Tris, 25 mm sucrose with 320 μm86RbCl without or with 10 mm RbCl at 25 °C. After 60 min, the samples were diluted with 20 ml of ice-cold buffer as described above except 320 μm86Rb was replaced with 30 mm KCl with or without 10 mmRbCl. The rubidium-occluded enzymes were isolated on a Millipore membrane (20Rossi R.C. Norby J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12579-12590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and measured as described previously (19Yamaguchi M. Tonomura Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1979; 86: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To estimate rubidium occlusion via E2P, pig kidney enzymes were also incubated with 320 μm86RbCl in the presence of variable concentrations of ATP in the presence of 16 mmNaCl + 1 mm CaCl2 or 160 mm NaCl + 0.43 (or 4) mm MgCl2 for 10 s at 0 °C. Fig. 1 shows that the amount of bound 32P in the presence of 0.43 mm magnesium + 2 m sodium with increasing concentrations of [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ATP increased to give saturation at ∼1 and ∼0.5 mol/mol of α-chain (K0.5 = 30∼20), respectively.

( Tokyo ). 1986; 100: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), estimated as trichloroacetic acid-stableE 32P formed from [γ-32P]ATP under steady state conditions, was 0.5 mol/mol of α-chain (K0.5 = 7 μm) as has been shown previously (10Tsuda T. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24334-24338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These data show that 1 mol of 32P bound in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP was due to 0.5 mol each of NaE1P and trichloroacetic acid-labile enzyme-bound ATP or Pi. Thus, 0.5 mol of 32P bound in the presence of [α-32P]ATP was due to the trichloroacetic acid-labile enzyme-bound ATP or ADP. A similar stoichiometry of32P binding and phosphorylation was also observed (not shown) in the dog kidney enzyme, giving ∼3.5 nmol of phosphoenzyme/mg of protein as in the case of the pig kidney enzyme. These data can be explained by the presence of a diprotomer, designated as NaE1P: E·ATP or NaE1P: E·ADP/Pi. The binding of 32P is enzymatic, as evidenced by the fact that the amount of 32P bound to pig enzymes at ∼10 s after the addition of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ATP, respectively, decreased to 3 and ∼20%, after a 15-min incubation at 0 °C. To investigate the presence of bound 32P in E2P, the concentrations of sodium were reduced from 2 m to 16 mm to increase the fraction of E2P (14Taniguchi K. Suzuki K. Iida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10659-10667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Taniguchi K. Suzuki K. Kai D. Matsuoka I. Tomita K. Iida S. J. Biol.

( Tokyo ). 1986; 100: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, inset, shows that the effect of changing sodium concentrations at a constant ionic strength of 2 mmaintained with choline chloride had a negligible effect on the stoichiometry of bound 32P, which reached nearly 1 mol/mol of α-chain in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The phosphoenzyme in the presence of 16 mm sodium + 1984 mm choline chloride and 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP with magnesium was shown to be a mixture of ∼0.25 mol of NaE1P and E2P each, and the amount of 32P bound in the presence of [α-32P]ATP was ∼0.5 mol/mol of α-chain. These data suggest the accumulation of 0.25 mol of either NaE1P:E·ATP or NaE1P:E·ADP/Pi and 0.25 mol of either E2P:E·ATP orE2P:E·ADP/Pi. In other words the nonphosphorylated α-chain of E2P also bound ATP or ADP/Pi as in the case of NaE1P. To investigate whether bound 32P is present in a rubidium-occluded enzyme (RbE2), rubidium occlusion was measured under various conditions as described under “Materials and Methods.” A rubidium-occluded enzyme (Fig.2, closed squares), which is formed directly by incubating the enzyme with 0.32 mmrubidium, lost occluded rubidium nearly completely upon the addition of 160 mm sodium with 0.43 or 4 mm magnesium or 16 mm sodium with 1 mm calcium. With increasing concentrations of ATP from 0 to 5 mm, the amount of rubidium occlusion increased to nearly 1 mol and then appeared to decrease to a constant level of ∼0.5 mol of rubidium/mol of α-chain, especially in the presence of 16 mm sodium + 1 mm calcium. For both 32P binding in the presence of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ATP, the amount of phosphoenzyme, and that of rubidium occlusion, were measured in the presence of 1 mmcalcium, 16 mm sodium, and 0.32 mm rubidium. Both 32P bindings were shown to be ∼0.5 mol/mol of α-chain with 0.02 mol of E 32P and ∼1 mol for the occluded Rb/α-chain. These data mean the stoichiometry of rubidium occlusion/EP dephosphorylation, ∼2, as shown in the case of another potassium congener, 2 thallium-occluded/EP-dephosphorylated (20Rossi R.C. Norby J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12579-12590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They are consistent with the view that 2 mol of rubidium occlusions occur in 1 mol of the α-chain, which was phosphorylated to form E2P just prior the binding of rubidium. These data suggest the presence of stoichiometric amounts of both RbE2 and trichloroacetic acid-labile bound 32P, such for RbE2: E·ATP or RbE2: E·ADP/Pi in the presence of ∼100 μm ATP with sodium and calcium or magnesium. To measure trichloroacetic acid-labile Pi more directly, a time course for the phosphorylation and liberation of Piwas followed by quenching the reaction with trichloroacetic acid. The addition of ATP in the presence of 2 m sodium with magnesium (Fig. 3 A) induced the accumulation of NaE1P (14Taniguchi K. Suzuki K. Iida S. J. Biol.

Iida S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1986; 100: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These data indicate the presence of the trichloroacetic acid-labile binding of ATP, but not of Pi, to the nonphosphorylated α-chains of NaE1P such as NaE1P: E·ATP. Fig. 3 B shows the addition of ATP in the presence of 16 mm sodium with magnesium-induced accumulation ofE2P (14Taniguchi K. Suzuki K. Iida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10659-10667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Taniguchi K. Suzuki K. Kai D. Matsuoka I. Tomita K. Iida S. J. Biol.

The maximum amount of Pi burst, estimated from the burst sizes observed via the additions of 25, 50, 100, and 200 μmATP, appeared to give 0.24 mol/mol of α-chain with an apparentKm of 43 μm. A similar Piburst has also been shown by the addition of 32 μm ATP at 25 °C (21Taniguchi K. Suzuki K. Sasaki T. Shimokobe H. Iida S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1986; 100: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These considerations suggest the presence of both 0.25 mol of trichloroacetic acid-labile ATP and ADP/Pi binding to nonphosphorylated α-chains of E2P, such asE2P: E·ATP: E2P: E·ADP/Pi. To investigate the effect of bound ATP and/or ADP/Pi on sodium-dependent ATP hydrolysis, the rate constant ofEP breakdown and the turnover number, v/EP, was compared. Fig. 3 B and theinset show that the rate constant andv/EP are, respectively, around 0.07/s and 0.18 ± 0.01/s. A value of v/EP, 0.15 ± 0.01/s, was also obtained in a similar experiment. The rate constant is approximately half the value of v/EP. These data clearly indicate that ATP hydrolysis occurs via bothE2P and enzyme-bound ATP and/or ADP/Pi. Fig. 3 C shows that the addition of ATP to the enzyme in the presence of 16 mm sodium, 0.43 mm magnesium, and 0.32 mm rubidium induced a rapid burst of Pi, followed by a slow steady increase of Piproduction without detectable phosphoenzyme. The magnitude of the burst, 0.42 mol/mol of α-chain, was close to the value of the maximum amount of EP in the absence of rubidium, 0.5 mol/mol of α-chain. These data show that the trichloroacetic acid-labile binding of ADP/Pi occurs to the non-rubidium-occluded α-chain of the enzyme in the form of RbE2:E·ADP/Pi. The data suggest that ATP hydrolysis occurs via KE2:E·ADP/Pi, which is considered to be a KE2·Pi complex, following the breakdown of E2P (Scheme FSI), as shown from the initial burst of Pi production (22Froehlich J.P. Albers R.W. Koval G.J. Goebel R. Berman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 251: 2186-2188Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The data described above and other data (10Tsuda T. Kaya S. Yokoyama T.

To obtain direct evidence for this, both solubilized and membrane-bound Na/K-ATPases were rotary-shadowed and observed by electron microscopy. Purified membrane-bound dog kidney Na/K-ATPase was solubilized (18Hayashi Y. Mimura K. Matsui H. Takagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 983: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether (C12E8) in the presence of 100 mm potassium acetate and subjected to gel filtration at 0 °C. The ATP binding capacity 2Y. Hayashi, unpublished data. appeared as three different peaks with molecular weights of 7.5 × 105-1.5 × 106, 3.0 × 105, and 1.5 × 105. When the first peak fraction was examined, tetrameric, dimeric, and monomeric structures, which may correspond to tetraprotomer, diprotomer, and protomer (αβ), respectively, were observed (Fig.4, A–D). The protomer showed a pear-like shape ∼21 nm in length and ∼11 nm in the width at the widest portion and appeared to be a unitary structure of the diprotomer and tetraprotomer. The percentages of these structures were 32, 39, and 27%, respectively, and higher oligomeric structures constituted only 2% (n = 151). The tetrameric, dimeric, and monomeric molecules were 29, 49, and 21%, respectively, for the second fraction (n = 200) and 18, 38, and 43%, respectively, for the third fraction (n = 208). When the structure of the molecules contained in the first peak fraction were fixed by cross-linking with a zero-length cross-linker, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC), the morphology of these structures was unchanged (Fig. 4, B and E), but their relative amounts were different; the higher oligomeric and tetrameric structures increased to 18 and 39%, respectively, and the monomeric structure decreased to 5% (n = 153). Therefore, it is possible that native enzyme could exist in a tetrameric form, which tends to dissociate into dimeric and monomeric forms when solubilized. Electron microscopy of the membrane-bound pig enzyme, which had been treated with EDC prior to solubilization with C12E8, also showed tetrameric, dimeric, and monomeric structures, which were morphologically similar to those observed for the dog enzyme (Fig. 4, A–E andF–H). To confirm that the molecules observed were, in fact, Na/K-ATPase molecules, the enzyme (10Tsuda T. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24334-24338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) containing ∼0.9 mol/mol of α-chain of Lys-501 labeled with fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate (FITC) was complexed with anti-FITC antibodies (Fig. 4, I andJ). The antibodies showed the presence of tetramer with 1–4 molecules of the antibodies attached to the wider end of the pear-like structure, which also indicated that the wider end reflected the cytosolic side (Fig. 4 J). No antibody binding was observed for the unlabeled enzyme. The tetraprotomeric nature of Na/K-ATPase was proposed nearly 20 years ago (12Askari A. Huang W.-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The experiments described in this paper not only show direct biochemical evidence for the presence of a tetraprotomer structure of Na/K-ATPase during ATP hydrolysis but also indicate quite new aspects of the enzyme forms. All reaction intermediates detectable in the Post-Albers scheme (Scheme FSI) bind ATP and/or ADP/Pi. Further experiments are required to clarify the role of tetrameric structure in Na/K-ATP hydrolysis, although changes in the subunit interaction by physiological ligands were already suggested (4Askari A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 359-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5Glynn I.M. Martonossi A. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes.

ATP binding is followed by four parallel paths, which occur at each of the two half-sites for phosphorylation-dephosphorylation and for ATP hydrolysis without acid-stable phosphoenzyme via (NaE1P: E·ATP)2, (E2P: E·ATP: E2P: E·ADP/Pi), and (KE2: E·ADP/Pi)2, respectively. The sequential formation of E2P from NaE1P and KE2 from E2P (Scheme FSI) is accompanied by, respectively, hydrolysis of half of the trichloroacetic acid-labile bound ATP to ADP/Pi and of another half of the bound ATP to ADP/Pi (Fig. 5). The finding related to the stoichiometric amount of trichloroacetic acid-labile ATP and ADP/Pi binding and the Pi burst via nonphosphorylated protomer(s) explain the long standing discrepancies between the turnover number of the enzyme, v/EP, and the rate constant for the breakdown of EP (5Glynn I.M.

Askari A FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). If the simultaneous presence of the sodium- and rubidium-bound form of the enzyme becomes clear as an intermediate of ATP hydrolysis such as the RbE2:NaE1·ADP/Picomplex, the determination of one of the two transport mechanisms, i.e. simultaneous or consecutive would be crucial. Further experiments, such as the binding stoichiometry of magnesium, sodium, and potassium to these subunits as shown as E·ATP andE·ADP/Pi (Fig. 5) and the ATP-induced subunit interactions will be required for better understanding the molecular mechanism of ATP hydrolysis."
