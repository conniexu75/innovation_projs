https://openalex.org/W1500418591,The enzymatic reduction of β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonic acid has been measured in cell-free systems prepared from the livers of rats maintained under various dietary conditions. It has been shown that the reductase reaction is markedly depressed when cholesterol is fed. This diminished activity has been observed in both the microsomes and in the subsequently solubilized preparation when an acetone powder technique is used. The effect of fasting upon β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reduction has been examined and the results also show a dramatic decrease in the reductase activity in both the microsomes and the solubilized enzyme.

The product(1,2-cyclohexanedione-arginine) was shown by independent synthesis to be N5-(4-oxo-1,3-diazaspiro[4.4]non - 2 - ylidene) - l - ornithine. At hydroxide concentrations of 0.2 n or higher, this was the principal product, and the reaction with free arginine and with the arginyl residues of model proteins was completed in 3 hours. At lower base concentration or with salmine at high base concentrations, a heterogeneous mixture of ninhydrin-positive products was observed. The reaction appears to be specific for the guanido group. Peptide maps of tryptic digests of 1,2-cyclohexanedione-treated chains of hemoglobin showed blocking of hydrolysis at arginyl bonds with no change in positions of tryptic peptides not adjacent to arginyl residues."

https://openalex.org/W1524617371,"Abstract Two nuclear ribonucleic acid fractions from normal and regenerating liver have been isolated and characterized by zone centrifugation and nucleotide analysis after 32P labeling. Comparison between the fractions from normal liver and those obtained from regenerating liver showed that regenerating liver synthesizes a markedly larger amount of ribosomal RNA than does normal liver. The administration of cortisol led to a 2- to 3-fold increase in the labeling of nuclear RNA, which affected both ribosomal and messenger RNA to the same extent. By comparing the hybridization properties of nuclear RNA fractions from normal and regenerating liver before and after cortisol treatment, it could be shown that cortisol causes the appearance of new species of messenger RNA both in normal and regenerating liver. No such differences could be found between messenger RNA populations of normal and regenerating liver from untreated animals."
https://openalex.org/W1521325148,"Abstract In order to trace the pathway of substrate-derived hydrogen in the mechanism of the glucose oxidase reaction, the kinetics of oxidation of d-glucose-1-2H was studied by conventional and stopped flow spectrophotometric methods. The results were compared with those for d-glucose-1-1H. A deuterium kinetic isotope effect was shown in the over-all reaction kinetics. The magnitude of this effect was highly dependent on the concentrations of sugar and oxygen. Stopped flow kinetic studies of the glucose half-reaction under anaerobic conditions located the kinetic isotope effect (between 10 and 15 at 3°) at the flavin reduction step. These studies also provided evidence for a complex between oxidized enzyme and d-glucose. Stopped flow measurements of the enzyme in turnover with d-glucose-1-2H showed that both the turnover rate of the enzyme at infinite oxygen concentration and the turnover rate of the oxidized fraction of the enzyme were almost identical with the independently measured rate of the d-glucose-1-2H half-reaction. These results indicated that, on the substitution of deuterium for hydrogen, no first order rate-limiting steps could be shown, under the conditions of the experiments, other than that associated with flavin reduction by d-glucose-1-2H. Our kinetic results are accomodated by the following general scheme. [see PDF for equation] where P1 and P2 are d-glucono-δ-lactone and H2O2, respectively, and G is β-d-glucose. The change in the rate constant for flavin reduction brought about by substrate deuteration requires the results to be expressed by two special cases of the general steady state rate equation. For d-glucose-1-1H, as was shown previously, [see PDF for equation] whereas for d-glucose-1-2H [see PDF for equation] These rate equations express both the substrate concentration dependence of the kinetic isotope effect on the over-all reaction kinetics and the fact that the isotope effect on the flavin reduction step is much larger than that observed in the overall reaction. All rate constants in the scheme were evaluated, although there was an uncertainty of about ±25% in the value of k2 for d-glucose-1-1H. The validity of both the scheme and the numerical values of the rate constants was checked satisfactrorily by analogue computer simulation of the results of the stopped flow experiments performed on the glucose half-reaction and the enzyme in turnover. Because of the dominance of k2 in the kinetics of oxidation of d-glucose-1-2H, it was not possible to determine whether hydrogen transfer was important in the oxygen half-reaction. There was no solvent deuterium effect on any step in the mechanism with either substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1608652897,"Abstract Two separate alginic acid eliminases have been purified from abalone hepatopancreas. Alginase I appeared to be specific for β-1,4 bonds involving d-mannuronic acid units and apperently acts at random on internal bonds. Alginase II appeared to cleave 1,4 bonds involving l-guluronic acid and to work at or near chain ends. A combination of both enzymes could not degrade alginic acid completely, indicating the presence of other types of bonds. An ionic concentration of about 50 to 75 mm was required for maximum activity. It appears that the high ionic strength was necessary to remove bound water from the substrate, alginic acid, and to neutralize the negative charges on the polyanion in order to render the molecular configuration more suitable for enzyme action."

https://openalex.org/W1525457484,"Abstract 1. Submitochondrial particles supplemented with bromthymol blue, found in independent experiments to be bound to the particles, exhibit characteristic decreases of absorbance upon activation of electron transport by addition of substrate or oxygen to the anaerobic material or by addition of adenosine 5'-triphosphate to the sulfide-inhibited material. The responses are reversible upon exhaustion of substrate or oxygen or upon utilization of adenosine 5'-triphosphate. 2. Inhibitors of electron transport (sulfide or antimycin A) reverse the bromthymol blue responses activated by substrate and oxygen. 3. Uncoupling agents, for example, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, rapidly reverse the bromthymol blue responses upon addition of substrate, oxygen, or adenosine 5'-triphosphate. 4. Glass electrode measurements external to the submitochondrial particles confirm an alkalinization outside the particles on activation of electron transport. On the basis of these observations, the decolorization of bromthymol blue upon activation of electron transport is attributed to an intravesicular acidification. 5. The total amount of hydroxyl ion production exterior to the vesicles is 50 to 60 mµmoles of hydroxyl ions per mg of protein, a value roughly 10 times in excess of the maximal content of respiratory carriers of the particles, and several fold greater than the measured calcium content, but considerably less than the magnesium content. 6. In view of the observed cation content of the submitochondrial particles employed and the similarities in the bromthymol blue responses caused by activation of electron transport to those caused by the addition of acetate or ethylene glycol 2-(2-aminoethyl)-tetraacetate, the intravesicular acidification is attributed to the energy-linked movement of bound cations from the inside of the vesicle to the outside medium. 7. The response of bromthymol blue affords a highly sensitive measure of energy conservation; a response to the oxidation of 1 nmole of reduced β-diphosphopyridine nucleotide is readily measurable. 8. The kinetics of activation of the bromthymol blue response and of its inactivation by inhibitors of electron transport and by uncouplers as well suggests that the cation movement is a reversible phenomenon and that a circulation of cations through the vesicular membrane occurs. 9. Much experimental evidence is consistent with a chemical mechanism for cation movements below 0.2 mg of protein per ml, suggesting that the bromthymol blue response is due to a dissociable component of the vesicular membranes, presumably a cation such as calcium. Also, ethylene glycol 2-(2-aminoethyl)-tetraacetic acid and acetate give bromthymol blue responses similar to those induced by activation of electron transport or adenosine 5'-triphosphate. The slow initial rate of hydrogen ion formation is consistent with the chemical mechanism. 10. The data of this paper do not afford support for compulsory movements of electrons in the respiratory chain and of hydrogen ions through the vesicular membrane. The initial rate of hydrogen ion formation is over 1000-fold slower than the initial rate of oxidation of reduced quinone and flavoprotein. The magnitude of the hydrogen ion change is too small by a factor of about 10 to represent a jump due to the oxidation of reduced quinones and flavin. The collapse of the pH gradient across the vesicular membrane occurs nearly as rapidly upon inhibition of electron transport by antimycin A as it does upon addition of an uncoupling agent. 11. A structural model for the movement of cations in a circulating pathway through the vesicular membrane operating according to the chemical mechanism has been proposed and is consistent with the available experimental data. 12. It is concluded that the chemical mechanism for oxidative phosphorylation is worthy of detailed experimental investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1605572231,"Abstract The pH dependence of the steady state kinetic parameters Km (app) and kcat of the δ-, acetylated δ-, and α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the specific amide substrate N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide, has been investigated in the neutral and alkaline pH regions. A completely automatic technique for measuring the hydrolysis of amides was used. New results and important aspects of the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of a specific amide substrate which have emerged from this investigation are the following. The pH dependence of the catalytic reaction at alkaline pH is adequately accounted for by the pH dependence of Km(app). In earlier experiments we have shown that in amide hydrolysis the steady state kinetic parameter Km(app) is a measure of an over-all enzyme-substrate dissociation constant (K's). (a) Km(app) was observed to be pH-dependent in the hydrolysis of N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide as catalyzed by all three forms of the enzyme. Analysis of this pH dependence shows that an ionizing group with pK(app) ∼ 8.5 is involved; an ionizing group of the enzyme with this pK(app) has been implicated in all chymotrypsin-catalyzed reactions that have been studied. (b) The catalytic rate constant kcat was found to be pH-independent in the pH region 8 to 10 for the δ-chymotrypsin-catalyzed reaction and in the pH region 8 to 9.2 for the α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed reaction. (c) The pH dependence of the steady state kinetic parameters kcat and Km(app) in the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis ofN-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide is consistent with the findings of our earlier studies of the individual steps in the reaction between chymotrypsin and diisopropyl fluorophosphate and in the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of N-acetyl-l-phenylalaninamide: studies which indicated that the pH dependence of chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis above pH 8 is due to the effect of pH on the formation of chymotrypsin complexes and not on the bond-breaking step. (d) The experiments reported here are not in agreement with earlier studies of Bender and his co-workers, which indicated that the pH dependence of chymotrypsin-catalyzed reactions above pH 8 is due to the effect of pH on the bond-breaking step, the formation of chymotrypsin-substrate complexes being pH-independent. The δ form of chymotrypsin is a more efficient catalyst than the α form in the hydrolysis of N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide, as indicated by both the observed maximum rate of reaction and the binding of substrate to enzyme. Both the values and the pH dependencies of the steady state kinetic parameters are different for these two forms of the enzyme, but are the same for δ- and acetylated δ-chymotrypsin. Only limited and qualified information regarding differences in the catalytic properties of α- and δ-chymotrypsin has been previously available. These and previous experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that the pH dependence of chymotrypsin-catalyzed reactions at alkaline pH is due to a pH-dependent equilibrium between two major conformations of the enzyme, with the same ionizing group of pK (app) ∼ 8.5 controlling both the equilibrium between enzyme conformations and the decrease in catalytic properties of the enzyme. This hypothesis leads to several predictions, discussed in this paper, which can be tested experimentally."
https://openalex.org/W1497353847,"Abstract 1. Liver mitochondria are able to bind large amounts of Ca++ through a process which is independent of metabolism. The amount of Ca++ bound is increased by increasing the pH of the medium and is decreased by the addition of univalent cations. The binding of Ca++ to the mitochondria is a function of the concentration of Ca++ in the medium and is affected by the Ca++ to protein ratio. 2. A large part of the metabolism-independent binding of Ca++ occurs in a space which is rendered accessible to univalent cations by valinomycin or gramicidin. In fact when the mitochondria are pretreated with valinomycin or gramicidin, the binding of Ca++ is increased in a sucrose medium and decreased in a KCl or NaCl medium. The competition between Ca++ and univalent cations has been studied. 3. The metabolism-independent binding of Ca++ is coupled to a release of H+ or of K+. The conditions affecting the exchange between divalent and univalent cations are studied and data are reported on the stoichiometry of H+:Ca++ and K+:Ca++ in normal and valinomycin-treated mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W1515347633,"Abstract On the assumption that only two of the acid per heme are affected by oxygenation, the in electrical charge, ΔX, between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb and Hb) at the same pH (as determined from the in their titration curves) is given by the equation. [see PDF for equation] where h = hydrogen ion concentration and Ko, K'o, Kr, and K'r are the ionization constants of these Bohr groups in O2Hb and Hb, respectively. The above equation has been found to fit (within the limits of experimental error) the data on the difference titration curves for bovine, human, and horse O2Hb and Hb over the pH range 5.0 to 9.3 at 25–37°; best (i.e. least mean square) values of the ionization constants have been estimated statistically by means of an automatic computer program, written in Fortran language. Thus, for human hemoglobin at 25°, pKr = 7.84 (±0.006), pKo = 6.84 (±0.009), pK'r = 5.13 (±0.04), and pK'o = 5.60 (±0.03). These figures differ by up to 0.7 pK unit from those obtained by other recent workers, who did not, however, analyze their data statistically. Values for the corresponding heats of ionization, Qo, Q'o, Qr and Q'r, have been calculated from the effect of temperature on the respective ionization constants. The most accurate results have been obtained in the case of human hemoglobin, wherein it is found that (Qr - Qo) is 5,000 (±800) cal. The actual value of Qr is of the order of 11,000 cal and thus lies outside the usual range for the heat of ionization of imidazole and its derivatives. These conclusions are based upon the experimental data not only of the present paper but also of the recent paper (11) of Antonini, Wyman, Brunori, Fronticelli, Bucci, and Rossi-Fanelli, the concordance between these two independent sets of results, when statistically analyzed, being very satisfactory. (Q'o - Q'r) has also been found to be of the order of 5000 cal, but this figure is subject to a wide margin of uncertainty, owing to the difficulty in obtaining accurate estimates of pK'o and pK'r from data in the acid pH range, wherein hemoglobin is unstable. Preliminary experiments have shown that at pH below 6.2 rapid titration figures (i.e. within 10 msec) differ significantly from the results obtained by the customary slow titration procedure, which takes several minutes. The results of this paper are discussed in light of current views on the chemical and x-ray structure of O2Hb and Hb."

Only long chain fatty acyl carnitine derivatives were effective in stimulating lipogenesis. The increase induced by 50 µm (+)-palmitylcarnitine was approximately 5-fold in liver supernatant fractions prepared from fed rats and 10-fold in preparations from fasted animals. (-)-Carnitine and (-)-palmitylcarnitine also increased fatty acid synthesis from acetate, but to a considerably lesser extent. Deoxycarnitine decreased acetate incorporation into fatty acids. Rates of acetate incorporation into fatty acids by fasted liver preparations supplemented with (+)-palmitylcarnitine were higher than those obtained in nonsupplemented livers from fed rats, but were still less than values achieved in (+)-palmitylcarnitine-treated livers from fed animals. Stimulation of fatty acid synthesis by (+)-palmitylcarnitine was shown to be at the level of malonyl-CoA formation. Partially purified preparations of acetyl-CoA carboxylase were activated equally well by either (+)- or (-)-palmitylcarnitine at all citrate concentrations tested, provided that enzyme preparations were free of carnitine palmityltransferase activity. Palmityl-CoA inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase was partially relieved by (+)-palmitylcarnitine in the presence or absence of citrate or malonate. It was concluded that inhibition of hepatic fatty acid synthesis observed in fasted rats could not be accounted for by a decrease in enzyme capacity. Enzymes required for lipogenesis were present but masked in livers from fasted animals. It appeared that acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the complex system was inhibited by a factor (factors) such as palmityl-CoA which could be reversed by (+)-palmitylcarnitine addition, but not by citrate or malonate. (+)-Palmitylcarnitine stimulation of fatty acid synthesis could not be accounted for by invoking inhibition of carnitine palmityltransferase. The possible role of (-)-palmitylcarnitine formation from palmityl-CoA and relationships between effects of the two fatty acyl derivatives on the control of fatty acid synthesis are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1603664898,"Abstract Two vitamin B12-binding glycoproteins, isolated from hog pyloric mucosa as their vitamin B12 complexes and in noncomplexed form, differ greatly in intrinsic factor activity but are similar in chemical and physical properties. However, intrinsic factor, either as its vitamin B12 complex or in noncomplexed form, contains more galactose and less galactosamine and glucosamine than its inactive counterpart. About one-third of the weight of these preparations is carbohydrate, resulting in a low partial specific volume of 0.68 ml per g. The weight average molecular weight of the noncomplexed preparations was about 50,000, and the sedimentation coefficient was 3.7 S. The vitamin B12 complexes had weight average molecular weights of about 100,000 and sedimentation coefficients of 4.6 S. Viscosity measurements with a noncomplexed preparation gave an intrinsic viscosity of 0.06 dl per g, indicating a nearly spherical molecule. Incubation of a noncomplexed preparation with vitamin B12 at 37° slowly produced the 100,000 molecular weight form. Conversely, treatment of the 100,000 molecular weight form with 5 m guanidinium chloride slowly gave rise to the 50,000 molecular weight form. Prolonged treatment with guanidinium chloride did not reduce the molecular weight below 50,000. These data are interpreted as showing that following vitamin B12 binding, intrinsic factor undergoes a slow dimerization which is reversible by guanidinium treatment. Based on vitamin B12-binding capacity and molecular weight, a model of the dimerization process is proposed in which the dimer may contain either 1 or 2 molecules of vitamin B12."

All of the incorporated tritium was found in the streptidine portion of the molecule. Evidence is presented that S. griseus synthesizes myo-inositol from d-glucose and that the organism interconverts myo-inositol and scyllo-inositol. The implications of these findings are discussed. The biosynthesis of the N-methyl-l-glucosamine moiety of streptomycin from d-glucose, l-glucose, and d-glucosamine by S. griseus has been studied. d-Glucoses, labeled with 14C in positions 1,2, 3–4, or 6, were given to cultures of S. griseus. The distributions of label found in the N-methyl-l-glucosamine moiety of the streptomycin synthesized further support a mechanism involving multiple inversion of the asymmetrical carbon atoms of d-glucose to from the l-sugar. l-Glucose-1-14C was administered to S. griseus. No incorporation of isotope into streptomycin was detected. Evidence was also obtained that d-glucosamine plays a role in the synthesis of N-methyl-l-glucosamine.

The maximum iodine incorporation approaches 12 g atoms of iodine per mole of insulin: 8 g atoms in the 4 tyrosyl residues and 4 g atoms in the 2 histidyl residues. The presence of zinc in insulin leads to (a) a reduction in the initial rate of iodine incorporation which can be ascribed to an effect on the reactivity of the tyrosyl residues, and (b) a diminution in the total iodine incorporation because 1 of the histidyl residues is unavailable in zinc insulin. The S-carboxymethylated B chain of insulin is much less sensitive to zinc, and both histidyl residues can be iodinated. Carboxymethylhistidine insulin can be iodinated only in its 4 tyrosyl residues. No iodohistidine is formed. It is postulated that both direct chemical and conformational factors are involved in the effect of zinc on the iodination of insulin."

This re sponse was obtained between two wick electrodes placed at different positions on top of the leaf, with the entire leaf uniformly illuminated by the flash. During the first millisecond or so, the electrode nearer the apex of the leaf always became negative with respect to an electrode at the base, which indi cates that the voltage-generating source is fixed longitudinally in the leaf."

Presumably, differences in the biological activities of these compounds can be correlated with differences in their electron distribution. The relative effects on axons parallel those on junctions of the electroplax, suggesting the presence of similar receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1602472970,"Abstract The total heats of ionization, Qo and Qr, of bovine, human, and horse oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb and Hb) have been directly measured by the rapid calorimetric method over the pH range from 5.7 to 9.0, at 12–28°. The most extensive determinations have been those on bovine hemoglobin: above about pH 6.6 the thermal titration curve for Hb lies systematically above that for O2Hb by about 600 cal, this difference presisting practically unchanged up to the most alkaline pH (8.7) studied. The two thermal titration curves cross at approximately pH 6.3, below which the O2Hb curve lies above the Hb curve by an increasing amount (up to 1,000 cal). The fact that Qr remains greater than Qo at pH 8.7, at which the absolute value of Qr is about 11,000 cal, implies that the heme-linked group, which ionizes in this pH range in the case of Hb, must have a heat of ionization, Qr, of around 11,000 cal. This figure, which was confirmed by an approximate method of calculation, lies outside the range usually attributed to the heat of ionization of imidazole or its derivatives. There is some indication, from a comparison of the difference between the two thermal titration curves for human Hb and O2Hb at approximately pH 7.3, that (Qr - Qo) is of the order of 4,000 cal, Qo being the heat of ionization of the corresponding heme-linked group in O2Hb. The results thus support the conclusions reached in the adjoining paper by Rossi-Bernardi and Roughton on the effect of temperature on the oxygen-linked ionizations of hemoglobin. The relation of the present studies to the cognate effects of pH on the heat of oxygenation of hemoglobin is briefly indicated."

https://openalex.org/W1575108370,"Abstract The association and ionization constants for the formation of 1:1 complexes between cupric ions and several unsaturated dipeptides have been evaluated. Rates of copper-activated hydrolyses of the dehydropeptides were measured spectrophotometrically. From the data obtained it was concluded that copper-activated hydrolysis of unsaturated dipeptides occurs after the dissociation of a proton from the hydration sphere of the 1:1 copper-dehydropeptide complex. Furthermore, the hydrolytic cleavage of the labile complex required a phenyl group to provide a conjugated system for transport of electrons away from the carbonyl group of the peptide bond. If the phenyl group was present, the rate of copper-activated hydrolysis increased as the strength of the copper-peptide association increased. Purified renal dipeptidase was also employed to catalyze the hydrolysis of the unsaturated dipeptides. The enzymic reaction differed from copper-activated hydrolysis in that the phenyl group was not required for hydrolysis to occur; in fact, the enzyme cleaved glycyldehydroalanine 3 times faster than glycyldehydrophenylalanine. Also, alcohols at concentrations 100 times that of the substrate did not inhibit the peptidase, while considerable inhibition at these alcohol-substrate ratios occured in the copper-activated system. Finally, l-leucine acted as a stereospecific, competitive inhibitor of renal dipeptidase, and it stopped copper-activated hydrolysis completely by removing cupric ions from the copper-dehydropeptide complex."

https://openalex.org/W2078849061,"The bioelectrical characteristics of a crab nerve fiber subjected to solutions containing the impermeant anions ferrocyanide, glutamate, or ethanolsulfate substituted for chloride include prolonged slow depolarizations that elicit prolonged trains of impulses superimposed on the plateau portion. Propionate and nitrate depress repetitive firing while thiocyanate has only a slight effect. Nerves treated with ferrocyanide lose potassium and gain sodium, which fact may account for their depolarization. On the other hand, studies with interference microscopy reveal shift by ferrocyanide in the interference fringe pattern of the sheath material; this suggests a reorientation of fixed charges in the protein layers by direct action of the anion on these layers. This may also account for the electrical manifestations observed."
