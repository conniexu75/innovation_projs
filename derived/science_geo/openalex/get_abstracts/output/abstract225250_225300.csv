https://openalex.org/W1991371327,"PHENOLIC spraying reagents for the detection of sugars on paper chromatograms as introduced by Forsyth1, while greatly improving the selectivity of the method, had the disadvantages that the mineral acid attacked the paper, making it brittle when dried, and giving rise to dark background colours, and that the solvent caused diffusion of the sugar, with consequent poor definition of the spot boundary. Partridge2 found reduced attack on the paper by the use of trichloracetic acid as acidifying agent, and reported improved spot definition with aniline hydrogen phthalate dissolved in butanol3. Other agents proposed have included aniline hydrogen oxalate4, aniline – trichloracetic acid5, benzidine – acetic acid6, and ethanolic solutions of phenols and amines acidified with small amounts of hydrochloric acid7."
https://openalex.org/W2013604580,"IN a recent review, Vallee and Altschule1 have suggested that though many workers have estimated zinc in living tissues, the methods used have often been inaccurate. We have estimated the zinc content of certain tissues of the Collip hooded rat by the dithizone method of Vallee and Gibson2. Mature animals were used which were fed on a diet of fox chow containing about 75 µgm. zinc per gm., supplemented with carrot and cabbage. Most tissues contained about 15–30 µgm. zinc per gm.; but certain male genital organs showed wide deviations from this range. The literature contains few references to the zinc content of the genital system, though Bertrand and Vladesco3 reported high results in herring's and horse's testis, pig's seminal vesicle, rat's epididymis and in the prostate of the bull and of man. Kadota4 mentioned briefly that zinc could be detected by a relatively insensitive histochemical method in the rabbit prostate. The figures given by Leiner and Leiner5 for rat's testis and by Eggleton6 for human testis were within the usual range for soft mammalian tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2003252074,"IT has been known to entomologists for many years that if a bright light is used for attracting insects at night, the catches are considerably higher near the period of new moon than near full moon. One of us (C. B. W.) showed1,2 that in three successive years, between May and October, the catches in a light trap, both of Lepidoptera alone and of all insects together (chiefly Diptera), reached a peak at, or shortly after, new moon, when the geometric mean catches were three to four times as great as those at full moon."

The method of estimation was open to large errors."

https://openalex.org/W2031977357,"Rigorous chemical separations performed on radioactivities found in snows around Ann Arbor, Michigan, after the Las Vegas atomic test explosions on January 27 to February 6, 1951, have definitely established the presence of radioactive rare-earth isotopes and Ba and/or Sr isotopes and have shown the possible presence of I isotopes. The tests conducted on the samples are described. Because of the chemical distribution of the activities found in the Ann Arbor snows, these activities undoubtedly originated in the Las Vegas atomic test explosions."

https://openalex.org/W1987005159,"IN a recent communication1, I described a new colour reaction for the antithyroid drugs, 2-thiouracil and 4-methyl-2-thiouracil. This is based upon the yellow colour which is given when small concentrations of the drugs are treated with 2 : 6-dichloro-quinone-chloroimide at pH 8.0. Although some free amino-acids, purines and other urinary solutes give coloured products in the reaction, these latter are insoluble in chloroform, whereas within certain concentration limits the coloured products of the reaction with the drugs are readily extractable from the aqueous phase by this solvent. By this means the colour reaction has been made specific, and has been applied to the colorimetric determination of methyl-thiouracil in urine."

https://openalex.org/W2005994000,"AN experiment was carried out on the College farm at Giza to study the heat tolerance of buffaloes and Egyptian, shorthorn and Jersey cows. A total of 107 females of different ages was used for a period of ten months, from November 1949 until August 1950. Body-temperature, respiration-rate and pulse-rate were recorded twice weekly. On each occasion six readings were taken at three-hour intervals starting at 6 a.m. The animals were grouped according to their age and then subdivided according to their breed. The average monthly air temperature ranged from 10.9° C. in January to 27.8° C. in July, and that of relative humidity from 49 per cent in May to 83 per cent in November."
