https://openalex.org/W2161810908,"Mapping of homozygous deletions on human chromosome 10q23 has led to the isolation of a candidate tumor suppressor gene, PTEN , that appears to be mutated at considerable frequency in human cancers. In preliminary screens, mutations of PTEN were detected in 31% (13/42) of glioblastoma cell lines and xenografts, 100% (4/4) of prostate cancer cell lines, 6% (4/65) of breast cancer cell lines and xenografts, and 17% (3/18) of primary glioblastomas. The predicted PTEN product has a protein tyrosine phosphatase domain and extensive homology to tensin, a protein that interacts with actin filaments at focal adhesions. These homologies suggest that PTEN may suppress tumor cell growth by antagonizing protein tyrosine kinases and may regulate tumor cell invasion and metastasis through interactions at focal adhesions."

https://openalex.org/W2129974955,"The electrical properties of individual bundles, or “ropes,” of single-walled carbon nanotubes have been measured. Below about 10 kelvin, the low-bias conductance was suppressed for voltages less than a few millivolts. In addition, dramatic peaks were observed in the conductance as a function of a gate voltage that modulated the number of electrons in the rope. These results are interpreted in terms of single-electron charging and resonant tunneling through the quantized energy levels of the nanotubes composing the rope."

https://openalex.org/W1981048891,Natural populations of guppies were subjected to an episode of directional selection that mimicked natural processes. The resulting rate of evolution of age and size at maturity was similar to rates typically obtained for traits subjected to artificial selection in laboratory settings and up to seven orders of magnitude greater than rates inferred from the paleontological record. Male traits evolved more rapidly than female traits largely because males had more genetic variation upon which natural selection could act. These results are considered in light of the ongoing debate about the importance of natural selection versus other processes in the paleontological record of evolution.

https://openalex.org/W2056868844,"The cerebellum traditionally has been viewed as a neural device dedicated to motor control. Although recent evidence shows that it is involved in nonmotor operations as well, an important question is whether this involvement is independent of motor control and motor guidance. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to demonstrate that attention and motor performance independently activate distinct cerebellar regions. These findings support a broader concept of cerebellar function, in which the cerebellum is involved in diverse cognitive and noncognitive neurobehavioral systems, including the attention and motor systems, in order to anticipate imminent information acquisition, analysis, or action."
https://openalex.org/W2039842713,"The transcription factor NF-AT responds to Ca 2+ -calcineurin signals by translocating to the nucleus, where it participates in the activation of early immune response genes. Calcineurin dephosphorylates conserved serine residues in the amino terminus of NF-AT, resulting in nuclear import. Purification of the NF-AT kinase revealed that it is composed of a priming kinase activity and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). GSK-3 phosphorylates conserved serines necessary for nuclear export, promotes nuclear exit, and thereby opposes Ca 2+ -calcineurin signaling. Because GSK-3 responds to signals initiated by Wnt and other ligands, NF-AT family members could be effectors of these pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2092841668,"Comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1) was observed at wavelengths from 2.4 to 195 micrometers with the Infrared Space Observatory when the comet was about 2.9 astronomical units (AU) from the sun. The main observed volatiles that sublimated from the nucleus ices were water, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide in a ratio (by number) of 10:6:2. These species are also the main observed constituents of ices in dense interstellar molecular clouds; this observation strengthens the links between cometary and interstellar material. Several broad emission features observed in the 7- to 45-micrometer region suggest the presence of silicates, particularly magnesium-rich crystalline olivine. These features are similar to those observed in the dust envelopes of Vega-type stars."
https://openalex.org/W2054379164,"Signal transmission by many cell surface receptors results in the activation of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinases that phosphorylate the 3' position of polyphosphoinositides. From a screen for mouse proteins that bind phosphoinositides, the protein GRP1was identified. GRP1 binds phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4, 5)P3] through a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and displays a region of high sequence similarity to the yeast Sec7 protein. The PH domain of the closely related protein cytohesin-1, which, through its Sec7 homology domain, regulates integrin beta2 and catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange of the small guanine nucleotide-binding protein ARF1, was also found to specifically bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. GRP1 and cytohesin-1 appear to connect receptor-activated PI 3-kinase signaling pathways with proteins that mediate biological responses such as cell adhesion and membrane trafficking."

https://openalex.org/W2004709114,"Legumain is a cysteine endopeptidase that shows strict specificity for hydrolysis of asparaginyl bonds. The enzyme belongs to peptidase family C13, and is thus unrelated to the better known cysteine peptidases of the papain family, C1 (Rawlings, N. D., and Barrett, A. J. (1994) Methods Enzymol. 244, 461-486). To date, legumain has been described only from plants and a blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni We now show that legumain is present in mammals. We have cloned and sequenced human legumain and part of pig legumain. We have also purified legumain to homogeneity (2200-fold, 8% yield) from pig kidney. The mammalian sequences are clearly homologous with legumains from non-mammalian species. Pig legumain is a glycoprotein of about 34 kDa, decreasing to 31 kDa on deglycosylation. It is an asparaginyl endopeptidase, hydrolyzing Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-7-(4-methyl)coumarylamide and benzoyl-Asn-p-nitroanilide. Maximal activity is seen at pH 5.8 under normal assay conditions, and the enzyme is irreversibly denatured at pH 7 and above. Mammalian legumain is a cysteine endopeptidase, inhibited by iodoacetamide and maleimides, but unaffected by compound E64 (trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane). It is inhibited by ovocystatin (cystatin from chicken egg white) and human cystatin C with Ki values < 5 nM. We discuss the significance of the discovery of a cysteine endopeptidase of a new family and distinctive specificity in man and other mammals.

We discuss the significance of the discovery of a cysteine endopeptidase of a new family and distinctive specificity in man and other mammals. Cysteine peptidases form one of the major groups of proteolytic enzymes, and can be divided into about 30 separate families on the basis of their molecular structures (reviewed in 1Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 461-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar and 2Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Perspect. Drug Discov. Design. 1996; 6: 1-11Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Three families of cysteine endopeptidases have been known to be represented in mammals. The most numerous are those of the papain family (C1), which include cathepsins B, H, L, S, and others. These are predominantly lysosomal enzymes, responsible for proteolysis in the lysosomal/endosomal system and also are secreted to act extracellularly. In the cytosolic fraction of the cell, there are members of the other two families of cysteine endopeptidases: the families of calpain (family C2) and caspase (previously interleukin 1β-converting enzyme; C14). These peptidases mediate limited proteolysis of cytosolic substrates. We now report that the legumain family (C13) can be added to the list of mammalian cysteine endopeptidases. Legumain is the name that was given by Kembhavi et al. (3Kembhavi A.A. Buttle D.J. Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) to an endopeptidase that is present in many leguminous and other seeds, after they had isolated and characterized the enzyme from Vigna aconitifolia (moth bean). Legumain is specific for the hydrolysis of asparaginyl bonds. The amino acid sequence of legumain from Ricinus communis (castor bean) showed it to be homologous with an enzyme from the fluke Schistosoma mansoni (4Hara-Nishimura I. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1651-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). At that time, the fluke enzyme was of unknown specificity, but it has now been shown also to be an asparaginyl endopeptidase (5Dalton J.P. Hola-Jamriska L. Brindley P.J. Parasitology. 1995; 111: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), active on the test substrate that had been introduced by Kembhavi et al.

It was soon evident that legumain is present in human and other mammalian cells.

Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-NHMec prepared as described (3Kembhavi A.A. Buttle D.J. Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) was standardized by complete hydrolysis with legumain. Bz-Asn-NHPhNO2 was supplied by Bachem. Sodium citrate buffer solutions were prepared by mixing equimolar solutions of citric acid and trisodium citrate, to the desired pH value. Sodium citrate/phosphate buffers in the range pH 3.0-7.5 were as described by McIlvaine (see 6Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. Clarendon Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1987: 427Google Scholar). Ovocystatin (cystatin from chicken egg white) was prepared as described (7Anastasi A. Brown M.A. Kembhavi A.A. Nicklin M.J.H. Sayers C.A. Sunter D.C. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and recombinant human cystatin C was the kind gift of Dr. Magnus Abrahamson (Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Lund, Sweden). Both cystatins were titrated with a solution of papain (Sigma, 2 × crystallized) that had been standardized with E64 (8Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 771-778Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 9Barrett A.J. Kembhavi A.A. Brown M.A. Kirschke H. Knight C.G. Tamai M. Hanada K. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar), and the concentrations quoted in the text relate to active inhibitor. Azocasein was prepared as described by Barrett and Kirschke (10Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). For the preparation of the His-tagged, recombinant C-fragment of tetanus toxoid, the construct of Makoff et al (44Makoff A.J. Ballantine S.P. Smallwood A. Fairweather N.F. Biotechnology. 1989; 7: 1043-1046Google Scholar) was modified to include a histidine tag. 2E. Hewitt, C. Watts, and A. J. Makoff, unpublished results. A normal, full-term human placenta was kindly made available by the Rosie Maternity Hospital, Cambridge, and kidneys from freshly killed pigs were purchased from a local abattoir. Rats were Porton Wistar and rabbits New Zealand Whites. One forward PCR primer (Hsl1f, 5ʹ-CTCCAGGAATTCTGATCAACAGGC-3ʹ) and three reverse primers (Hsl2r, 5ʹ-GTCCGAAGCTTCCATCCAGTTGACG-3ʹ; Hsl3r, 5ʹ-GCCAGTTGAAGCTTTGGGTCCGGAAG-3ʹ; Hsl4r, 5ʹ-GTCTCTGATCAGCACACAGTCGG-3ʹ) were synthesized with Perceptive Biosystems Expedite 8909 equipment. The sequences of the primers were based on those of human ESTs identified as homologous to legumains of plants or Schistosoma Accession numbers of representative ESTs are F01300 for Hsl1f, R17110 for Hsl2r, R36331 for Hsl3r, and R25616 for Hsl4r. The locations of the primers in the sequence of legumain are shown in Fig. 1; the sequence of Hsl4r is located in the 3ʹ-untranslated region of human legumain. An EcoRI restriction site was built into the primer Hsl1f, and HindIII sites into Hsl2r and Hsl3r for use in cloning; these are underlined in the primer sequences. PCR reactions were in 50 μl for 30 cycles (94°C, 1 min; 48°C, 1 min; and 72°C, 2 min). The 3ʹ proofreading polymerase Pfu (11Lundberg K.S. Shoemaker S.D. Adams M.W.W. Short J.M. Sorge J.A. Mathur E.J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), was used for all amplification reactions. Combinations of the Hsl1f forward primer (500 nM) with each of the three reverse primers (500 nM) were used with human placenta 5ʹ-Stretch Plus cDNA library in λgt11 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as the template. The PCR products were separated in 1% agarose gels and purified with a Geneclean kit (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA fragments were then digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and cloned into pSP65 (Promega, Madison, WI). The nucleotide sequences of the various clones were determined for both strands either by the dideoxy chain-termination method (12Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar), or by Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing reactions in conjunction with an Applied Biosystems model 373 DNA Sequencer. To obtain the clone containing the N terminus of legumain, a human placenta Marathon-Ready™ cDNA (Clontech) was used as the template for 5ʹ-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (13Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar). The forward adaptor primer (AP1) and the reverse, nested gene-specific primer (Hsl5r, 5ʹ-CACGTGATCCTGGGGGCCACTC-3ʹ, based on EST R17110) were used for amplification reactions as recommended by the manufacturer. A single product of approximately 500 bp was obtained. The cDNA fragment representing the 5ʹ end of the legumain sequence was cloned unidirectionally into pSP65 at AvaI and BamHI sites. Use of the nested AP2 primer in conjunction with the reverse Hsl4r primer gave a full-length legumain cDNA, which was sequenced. Partial cloning and sequencing of pig legumain cDNA was achieved by a similar PCR strategy. Two pig kidney cDNA libraries (gifts of Dr. Jerzy Adamski, Max-Plank-Institut für Experimentelle Endokrinologie, Hannover, Germany, and Dr. Claudia T. Evans, University of Texas Medical Center, Dallas, TX) were used as templates for the amplification reactions. A 936-bp cDNA fragment was obtained when primers Hsl1f and Hsl3r were used. Except when stated, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was in gels of 10% T, 2.6% C containing the Ammediol buffer system (14Bury A.F. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 213: 491-500Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Staining for protein was with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R, and glycoproteins were detected with the DIG glycan detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Transferrin and thimet oligopeptidase served as positive and negative controls, respectively. In some experiments, samples were run in a Tris/Tricine-buffered, 10-20% polyacrylamide gradient Ready gel (Bio-Rad). Continuous fluorometric assays with Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-NHMec were as described (3Kembhavi A.A. Buttle D.J. Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. The substrate (10 μM) was incubated at 30°C in 2.50 ml of 39.5 mM citric acid, 121 mM Na2HPO4, pH 5.8, containing 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% CHAPS (assay buffer). The rate of formation of product was followed in a Perkin-Elmer fluorometer under the control of an IBM-compatible computer running the FLUSYS software (15Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1990; 6: 118-119PubMed Google Scholar). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 360 and 460 nm, respectively, and 1 unit of activity was defined as that releasing 1 μmol of product/min under the standard conditions. For the assay of activity in a tissue sample, the tissue was homogenized in four volumes (w/v) of 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 1 mM EDTA and 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Five complete strokes were used in a Braun-Potter homogenizer running at 1000 rpm. The homogenate was centrifuged (11,600 × g), and the supernatant was used in the enzyme assay as described above. Once a steady reaction rate had been determined (about 5 min), E64 was added to 10 μM. Two min later, ovocystatin was added to 50 nM, and the reaction was followed for an additional 5 min. Values for specific enzymic activity were calculated by use of protein concentrations determined in the Bradford assay (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as standard. Rate constants for irreversible inactivation were found by nonlinear regression analysis of the pseudo-first-order curves of inactivation by use of the FLUSYS software, giving kobs. The second order rate constant, k2 was calculated as kobs/[I], at [S] ≪ Km. Since the assay substrate was used at [S] ≪ Km, no correction for competition with the inhibitors was required. A temperature of 0-4°C was maintained throughout the procedure. All buffers contained 1 mM EDTA and 2 mM mercaptoethanol, and centrifugation was at 15,000 × g for 20 min, unless otherwise stated. Cortical tissue (250 g) was dissected from pig kidney and homogenized with an equal weight of water for 15 s in a Waring blender. The crude homogenate was stored at -20°C, or used immediately. The crude homogenate was mixed with an equal volume of 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 6.0, containing 0.4 M ammonium sulfate. The homogenate was centrifuged, and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was adjusted from 0.2 to 1.2 M ammonium sulfate by addition of the solid, stirred for 30 min, and centrifuged. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant made 3.2 M ammonium sulfate. After 30 min, the pellet containing the enzyme was collected by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in water, adjusted to pH 5.0 with 0.2 M citric acid, and dialyzed overnight against several changes of 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0. During the dialysis, a heavy, brown precipitate formed, which contained the legumain. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dispersed in 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0, by use of an Ultra Turrax homogenizer (Janke & Kunkel KG, Ika Werk, Staufen I. Breisgau, Germany), and collected by centrifugation. The pellet was washed again, but this time in 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 5.0, containing 10% (v/v) ethanediol. Legumain was then eluted from the pellet by resuspending it in 0.2 M sodium citrate, pH 6.0, containing 10% (v/v) ethanediol. Centrifugation (100,000 × g) gave a supernatant containing activity, which was dialyzed into 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0, and centrifuged once more at 100,000 × g The supernatant was adjusted to pH 5.5 with 0.1 M trisodium citrate, and applied to a column (20-ml bed volume) of SP-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia) that had been pre-equilibrated with 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5. The column was washed with two bed volumes of the equilibrating buffer before the enzyme was eluted with 0.4 M NaCl in the same buffer. Effluent fractions containing activity were combined and dialyzed into 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0. The solution was passed through 0.45- and 0.22-μm nitrocellulose filters in preparation for running on the Pharmacia Mono S FPLC column (type HR 10/10). A column (8-ml bed volume) of Thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B (Pharmacia) was activated with 2-pyridyl disulfide as described by the manufacturers. All buffers for use on the Mono S and Thiopropyl-Sepharose columns were mercaptoethanol-free, and were deoxygenated by sparging with nitrogen gas. The Mono S column was equilibrated with 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5. The two columns were connected in tandem. The sample was first run on to the Mono S column, which was then washed with three bed volumes of 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 1 mM EDTA at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. When the A280 of the effluent had fallen nearly to zero, activity was eluted with a step of 0.4 M NaCl in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5. As soon as protein was detected in the effluent, flow was redirected to the Thiopropyl-Sepharose column, and the flow rate was decreased to 0.25 ml/min. Once the entire peak of protein from the Mono S column had run through the Thiopropyl-Sepharose column, the column was washed with five bed volumes of 50 mM sodium citrate, 0.2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 5.5, before being filled with the same buffer containing 10 mM cysteine, 0.1% CHAPS, pH 5.5. The column was allowed to stand overnight at 4°C, and elution with the cysteine-containing buffer was resumed. Fractions containing activity were combined as the final product, which was stored at 4°C or -20°C in the eluting buffer. Legumain (15 μg in 0.25 ml) was dialyzed into 0.1 M citric acid, 0.2 M Na2HPO4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.025% CHAPS, pH 7.2, and heated at 100°C for 5 min. N-Glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) was then introduced (0.125 milliunit), and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The protein was precipitated from 10% trichloroacetic acid and taken up for SDS-PAGE. Legumain (90 μg) was digested with 50 μg of CNBr in 0.2 ml of 70% formic acid for 24 h at 25°C. The mixture was diluted 10-fold with water and freeze-dried. The sample was then resuspended and run in Tris/Tricine-buffered SDS-PAGE, and the separated peptides were transblotted on to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for N-terminal microsequence analysis. Legumain was titrated with ovocystatin, under tight-binding conditions. A set of assay tubes was prepared, each containing assay buffer (0.85 ml), legumain (1.0 milliunit/ml, 50 μl), and ovocystatin solution (0-50 μl, step 5 μl, of 3.0 μM, in 50 μl total). The tubes were equilibrated to 30°C for 5 min, and assays were started by adding 25 μl of 20 mM Bz-Asn-NHPhNO2 solution in Me2SO. After 5 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 1.0 ml of 0.1 M sodium chloroacetate in 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Activity was expressed as increase in A410 relative to a blank without enzyme. A linear plot of activity against ovocystatin concentration allowed the calculation of the molarity of the legumain solution, on the assumption of stoichiometric inhibition. Human legumain cDNA clones, containing either the 5ʹ or 3ʹ ends with overlapping regions and the full-length cDNA, were obtained by PCR amplification from human placenta cDNA libraries, and sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The nucleotide sequence of the full-length cDNA (Fig. 1) comprises 1393 bp with an in-frame ATG codon at nucleotides 71-73 conforming to the Kozak (17Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) consensus for a translational initiation site. An open reading frame of 1302 bp, with the termination codon at nucleotides 1370-1372, encodes a protein of 433 amino acid residues and 49,406 Daltons. A clone containing part of pig legumain cDNA was also obtained, by similar PCR-based cloning methods, when pig kidney cDNA libraries were used as templates. The pig legumain clone consists of 884 nucleotides encoding 294 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of the pig legumain cDNA corresponds to the region Asn91-Leu384 in human legumain (Fig. 2). Comparison by use of BESTFIT (18Genetics Computer Group Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8. University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI1994Google Scholar) reveals 83% identity at the nucleotide level and 84% at the amino acid level. Analysis of the N terminus of the deduced amino acid sequence of human legumain with the SIGCLEAVE program of EGCG (19Rice P. Program Manual for the EGCG Package. The Sanger Centre, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom1995Google Scholar) indicates the presence of a signal peptide, predicted to be cleaved at Ala17-Val18 (Fig. 1). There are four potential glycosylation sites in the deduced amino acid sequences of human and pig legumains, at Asn91, Asn167, Asn263 and Asn272 (in the numbering of Fig. 2). An Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif appears in the sequences of the mammalian legumains, and KGD in those of the flukes (Fig. 2, residues 118-120). RGD sequences in cell-adhesive proteins such as fibronectin (20Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Cell. 1986; 44: 517-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 21D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 246-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) and the disintegrins (22Gould R.J. Polokoff M.A. Friedman P.A. Huang T.-F. Holt J.C. Cook J.J. Niewiarowski S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Legumain is unusual among mammalian proteolytic enzymes in being unaffected by E64 but inhibited by cystatin, and these characteristics were used to confirm the specificity of the assays. E64 is a potent inhibitor of the cysteine peptidases of family C1 such as cathepsins B, H, and L (9Barrett A.J. Kembhavi A.A. Brown M.A. Kirschke H. Knight C.G. Tamai M. Hanada K. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar), but 10 μM E64 had no significant effect on the rates of hydrolysis of Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-NHMec by tissue extracts. In all cases, the activity was totally inhibited by 50 nM ovocystatin, however. It was noted that with these crude samples, the full activity of legumain was expressed even in the absence of exogenous thiol activator. The results of assays with a variety of mammalian tissues are shown in Table I. Activity was greatest in kidney, among the rat, pig, and rabbit tissues examined. A low level of activity (0.29 milliunit/mg) was unambiguously detected in human placenta (Fig. 3), but none was detected in blood leukocytes.Table ILegumain activity in mammalian tissuesTissueActivityRatPigRabbitmilliunits/mg proteinKidney2.645.72.89Spleen1.230.520.09Liver0.091.70.06Lung0.13——Large intestine0.12——Small intestine0.07——Muscle0.07——BrainNot detected—0.05TestisNot detected—0.13HeartNot detected—Not detected Open table in a new tab Pig kidney was selected as source for purification of legumain, and the results of a typical preparation are summarized in Table II. We found it necessary to devise an unconventional procedure for the purification of the enzyme, because legumain is stable only in the range pH 3-6 (see below), and at low salt concentrations it tends to be adsorbed to any solid material present. When the 1.2-3.2 M ammonium sulfate fraction (stage B) was dialyzed at pH 5.0, a heavy precipitate formed, to which the legumain was adsorbed. The enzyme eluted by raising the salt concentration at pH 6.0 showed a large increase in specific activity (stage C). The enzyme was also bound exceptionally tightly to SP-Sepharose at pH 5.5, requiring 0.4 M NaCl for elution. A large purification factor was achieved in this step (stage D). The enzyme was then run on Mono S in FPLC to separate it from low Mr thiols, and bound to Thiopropyl-Sepharose activated with 2-pyridyl disulfide. After overnight exposure to 10 mM cysteine, it was eluted in satisfactory yield. The over all purification factor was about 2200-fold, with a recovery of 8% (stage E).Table IIPurification of legumain from pig kidneyStageProteinActivitySpecific activityPurificationYieldmgunitsunits/mg-fold%A.

The enzyme was stable to storage at pH 5.8, showing little loss of activity over several months. This material was used for all further characterization of the enzyme. N-terminal and internal amino acid sequence data were obtained for the purified pig kidney legumain. An N-terminal sequence of 25 residues was obtained, together with an internal sequence of 19 residues (Fig. 2). Legumain was run in SDS-PAGE, with and without treatment with N-glycosidase F. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the original band at about 34 kDa was converted to a band at 31 kDa, consistent with deglycosylation. Proteins from a parallel gel were transblotted on to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained for glycan. Legumain gave a clear positive reaction, which was lost following exposure to N-glycosidase F, and the positive and negative controls gave the expected results (data not shown). Legumain solutions in sodium phosphate/citrate, pH 3.0-7.2, were incubated at 30°C, and samples were removed for assay at 2 and 4 h. It was found (Fig. 5A) that there was no appreciable loss of activity in the range pH 4.2-5.5, and even during 24 h there was little loss of activity in this range (data not shown). Below pH 4.2, stability fell off gradually, but above pH 6.0, it fell off precipitously, and no activity survived 2 h at pH 6.6. The rate of loss of activity above pH 6.0 was strongly dependent on temperature, so that at 25°C linear rates could be obtained in brief, continuous assays up to pH 7.0. The pH dependence of activity was determined in the same buffer system, at 25°C, with the result shown in Fig. 5B It can be seen that maximal activity occurred at pH 6.4. However, routine assays were more conveniently made at 30°C for longer periods, and pH 5.8 was selected as the most suitable value for these. Active site titration of a 1 unit/ml solution of legumain with 3.0 μM ovocystatin showed 2.0 μM reactive sites. For a 34-kDa protein, this would imply a specific activity of 14.7 units/mg. The actual specific activity of combined fractions of our final enzyme preparations in the standard assay, with Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-NHMec at pH 5.8 and 30°C, was only 7.7 (Table I), but values of 10 or more were seen with individual fractions on several occasions. The enzyme hydrolyzed Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-NHMec and Bz-Asn-NHPhNO2, but showed no action on Asn-NHMec or Asp-NHMec. Kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-NHMec by pig kidney legumain were: kcat 46 s-1, Km 50 μM, and kcat/Km 920,000 s-1M-1. These values are of similar magnitude to those for cathepsins B and L acting on their preferred aminomethylcoumarin substrates (10Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). Legumain was tested for hydrolysis of a range of oligopeptide substrates (from Sigma). Each peptide (50 μM in 100 μl) was incubated with 0.3 milliunit of legumain/ml in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, for 2 h at 30°C. Neurotensin, human VIP fragment 1-12, and chicken VIP fragment 16-28 were cleaved. The products were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography, and identified by amino acid analysis, revealing cleavage positions as shown in Fig. 6. It is evident that in each case, cleavage was at an asparaginyl bond. Other peptides that were cleaved, but for which the products were not identified, were neurotensin fragment 1-11, pig VIP fragment 1-28, bombesin, somatostatin, and allatotropin. All of these peptides contain asparaginyl bonds. Not all asparagine-containing peptides were cleaved, however; under the conditions of assay, there was no detectable hydrolysis of [Asn1,Val5]angiotensin II, Ala-Ser-Thr-Thr-Asn-Tyr-Thr, or Gly-Ser-Asn-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ile-Ile-Gly-Leu-Met. Other peptides that were not cleaved were bradykinin, substance P, dynorphin A fragment 1-13, and angiotensin I, none of which contains an asparaginyl bond. Azocasein (1.5%, w/v) in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 1 mM EDTA and 5 mM DTT, was incubated with legumain (5 milliunits/ml) for 1 h at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by making the mixture 3% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and soluble peptides were separated by filtration for quantification by A366. The enzyme caused an increase in A366 of 0.128 under these conditions. Under the same conditions, cleavage of both bovine serum albumin and human transferrin was evident in SDS-PAGE. There was no obvious enhancement of the rate of hydrolysis of these proteins by prior denaturation at 100°C for 5 min. The recombinant C-fragment of tetanus toxoid (50 μg i"

We mapped inhibition of p53-mediated transactivation to the p300/CBP-binding region of E1A. An E1A mutant incapable of physically interacting with Rb retained the capacity to inhibit transactivation by p53, whereas E1A mutants of the p300/CBP-interacting domain failed to inhibit p53. The inhibitory effect of the p300/CBP-binding region of E1A on p53 was demonstrated with p53-activated reporters and endogenous p53 targets such as p21(WAF1/CIP1) or MDM2. E1A lacking the capacity to interact with Rb, but capable of p300/CBP interaction, was competent in suppression of a DNA-damage activated p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint. Exogenous CBP and p300 were able to individually relieve E1A's inhibitory effect on p53-mediated transcription. Mutants of E1A that are not capable of interacting with p300 or CBP were found to efficiently stabilize endogenous p53 but were not competent in repression of p21 expression thus dissociating these two effects of E1A. Our results suggest that the p300/CBP-binding domain of E1A inhibits a p53-dependent cellular response which normally inhibits DNA replication following Adenovirus infection."

Rabbit osteoclasts were cultured on dentine slices for 24 h in the presence or absence of antisense S-ODN in a medium containing 100 nM Tfx™-50, polycationic liposome, as a carrier of the S-ODN. Uptake of the S-ODN by osteoclasts was confirmed microscopically using fluorescein-labeled S-ODN. The treatment with antisense significantly decreased the amount of cathepsin K protein in osteoclasts. The antisense inhibited the osteoclastic pit formation in a concentration-dependent fashion.

M., Potter, A. C., Phelps, S. R., Fisher, R., Trickett, J. I., and Davies, K. E. (1996) Nature 384, 349–353). However, there is currently a clear lack of information concerning the regulatory mechanisms presiding over utrophin expression during normal myogenesis and synaptogenesis. Using in situ hybridization, we show that utrophin mRNAs selectively accumulate within the postsynaptic sarcoplasm of adult muscle fibers. In addition, we demonstrate that a 1.3-kilobase fragment of the human utrophin promoter is sufficient to confer synapse-specific expression to a reporter gene. Deletion of 800 base pairs from this promoter fragment reduces the overall expression of the reporter gene and abolishes its synapse-specific expression. Finally, we also show that utrophin is present at the postsynaptic membrane of ectopic synapses induced to form at sites distant from the original neuromuscular junctions. Taken together, these results indicate that nerve-derived factors regulate locally the transcriptional activation of the utrophin gene in skeletal muscle fibers and that myonuclei located in extrasynaptic regions are capable of expressing utrophin upon receiving appropriate neuronal cues. Recently, the use of a transgenic mouse model system for Duchenne muscular dystrophy has demonstrated the ability of utrophin to functionally replace dystrophin and alleviate the muscle pathology (see Tinsley, J.

However, there is currently a clear lack of information concerning the regulatory mechanisms presiding over utrophin expression during normal myogenesis and synaptogenesis. Using in situ hybridization, we show that utrophin mRNAs selectively accumulate within the postsynaptic sarcoplasm of adult muscle fibers. In addition, we demonstrate that a 1.3-kilobase fragment of the human utrophin promoter is sufficient to confer synapse-specific expression to a reporter gene. Deletion of 800 base pairs from this promoter fragment reduces the overall expression of the reporter gene and abolishes its synapse-specific expression. Finally, we also show that utrophin is present at the postsynaptic membrane of ectopic synapses induced to form at sites distant from the original neuromuscular junctions. Taken together, these results indicate that nerve-derived factors regulate locally the transcriptional activation of the utrophin gene in skeletal muscle fibers and that myonuclei located in extrasynaptic regions are capable of expressing utrophin upon receiving appropriate neuronal cues."

https://openalex.org/W1967530735,"Narrowband photometric observations of comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1) between 25 July 1995 and 15 February 1997 indicated gas and dust production rates of 20 and 100 times greater, respectively, than observed at the same heliocentric distances for comet P/Halley in 1985. Hale-Bopp produced dust at a rate greater than has been observed for any other comet at any distance since at least 1977. On the basis of the observed production rate of the hydroxyl molecule, the calculated minimum effective diameter of Hale-Bopp's nucleus is 17 kilometers, but the actual diameter of the nucleus is likely to be at least two to three times larger. The chemical composition of Hale-Bopp is consistent with that of other long-period comets originating from the Oort Cloud."
https://openalex.org/W2326476347,"In most cases, Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) is associated with t(15;17) translocation which juxtaposes sequences from PML and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) genes. The generated PML-RAR alpha fusion interferes with wild type RAR alpha-mediated transcription and disrupts subnuclear compartments, known as PML bodies. Both defects are corrected by all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy which induces differentiation of leukemic cells and clinical remission. In a rare APL syndrome associated with t(11;17), fusion of the RAR alpha gene with the PLZF gene, encoding a Zinc-finger protein produces two reciprocal RAR alpha chimeras. Although PLZF-RAR alpha and PML-RAR alpha are similar in their apparent dominant negative effects, t(11;17)-associated APL is refractory to ATRA therapy. In a yeast two-hybrid genetic screening, we isolated clones encoding the GAL4 transactivation domain fused to various parts of PLZF. Using these autonomously transactivating hybrids, similar in structure to the RAR alpha-PLZF fusion, we mapped the DNA-binding domain of PLZF to the last five Zinc-fingers, a region retained in RAR alpha-PLZF chimera and characterized a specific PLZF target sequence. Our data support the hypothesis that RAR alpha-PLZF chimera is not an inert product of reciprocal translocation and may thus contribute to ATRA unresponsiveness of t(11;17)-associated APL."
https://openalex.org/W2104290057,"The activity of comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1) was monitored monthly by optical imaging and long-slit spectroscopy of its dust and gas distribution over heliocentric distances of 4.6 to 2.9 astronomical units. The observed band intensities of the NH 2 radical and the H 2 O + ion cannot be explained by existing models of fluorescence excitation, warranting a reexamination of the corresponding production rates, at least at large heliocentric distances. Comparing the production rate of the CN radical to its proposed parent, HCN, shows no evidence for the need of a major additional source for CN in Hale-Bopp at large heliocentric distances. The dust and CN production rates are consistent with a significant amount of sublimation occurring from icy dust grains surrounding Hale-Bopp."
https://openalex.org/W2171227014,"We have previously shown that mouse phosphorylated histone H1b (pH1b) was localized near nuclear sites that contained splicing factors. This observation suggested to us that pH1b was associated with transcribing chromatin. Here we investigated the relationship between phosphorylation of H1b and transcription. We demonstrate that treatment of normal or ras-transformed mouse fibroblasts with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D for 70 min results in a dramatic decrease in the level of pH1b. Similar results were observed when transcription was inhibited by 5,6-dichloro-1-μ-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB). When DRB was removed, the level of pH1b was restored after 2 h. Treatment of the cells with aphidicolin, a potent inhibitor of replication, resulted in a marked decrease in the level of pH1b after 30 min. This is the first report showing a dependence of histone modification upon ongoing transcription and replication. Inhibition of transcription or replication may hinder accessibility of H1b to the H1 kinase, supporting the idea that pH1b is associated with transcribing chromatin. Phosphorylation of H1b may be required to maintain a more decondensed chromatin structure to facilitate transcription and replication processes.

Phosphorylation of H1b may be required to maintain a more decondensed chromatin structure to facilitate transcription and replication processes. Due to their role in chromatin compaction, H1 histones are considered as general repressors of transcription (1Weintraub H. Cell. 1984; 38: 17-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, H1 is associated with transcriptionally active chromatin (2Belikov S.V. Belgovsky A.I. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Karpov V.L. Mirzabekov A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1031-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that we need to revise our thinking about H1 histones as general repressors to coparticipants with transcription factors in regulating transcription. H1 shares structural features found in transcription factors and can function as a positive or negative gene-specific regulator of transcription (3Shen X. Yu L. Weir J.W. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Mouse H1 consists of the subtypes H1a, H1b, H1c, H1d, H1e, and H10 that differ in amino acid sequence (4Parseghian M.H. Henschen A.H. Krieglstein K.G. Hamkalo B.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). There are changes in the pattern of synthesis of different H1 subtypes and a differential loss of subtypes during the formation of nondividing cells. In addition the subtypes differ in the degree and type of phosphorylation during the cell cycle (5Lennox R.W. Oshima R.G. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5183-5189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that each H1 subtype has unique properties led to the proposal that they differ from each other functionally (5Lennox R.W. Oshima R.G. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5183-5189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H1 has a tripartite structure consisting of a central globular core and lysine-rich N- and C-terminal domains. These domains interact with linker DNA to stabilize the compaction of chromatin, and they contain the sites of phosphorylation, many of which have cdc2/cdk2 consensus sequence sites. Phosphorylation of H1 may alter its interaction with linker DNA and, in turn, modulate chromatin structure (6Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 93-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). H1 phosphorylation is highest in the M phase of the cell cycle when chromatin is highly condensed; however, chromatin condensation has been shown to occur in the absence of H1 phosphorylation (7Guo X.W. Th'ng J.P.H. Swank R.A. Anderson H.J. Tudan C. Bradbury E.M. Roberge M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). There are a number of examples suggesting that H1 phosphorylation is more likely involved in chromatin decondensation rather than condensation (6Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 93-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). It was proposed that H1 phosphorylation could act as a first step mechanism for inducing chromatin decondensation, which would allow access of factors for gene activation or replication as well as for chromosome condensation (6Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 93-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Mouse fibroblast 10T1/2 cells transformed by ras, fes, mos, myc, raf, or combinations of ras, myc, and mutant p53 have an increased level of pH1b in comparison with the parental cells (8Chadee D.N. Taylor W.R. Hurta R.A. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20098-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Taylor W.R. Chadee D.N. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 51-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have suggested that the increase in pH1b levels is a result of the persistent activation of the MAP 1The abbreviations used are: APmitogen-activated proteinDRB5,6-dichloro-1-μ-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazolepH1bphosphorylated histone H1b. kinase signal transduction pathway leading to an increase in CDK2/cyclin E-associated H1 kinase activity. In agreement with our results it has recently been demonstrated that fibroblasts lacking the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product also exhibit an increased level of phosphorylated H1 and relaxed chromatin structure and that deregulation of CDK2 may be directly involved (10Herrara R.E. Chen F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11510-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). mitogen-activated protein 5,6-dichloro-1-μ-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole phosphorylated histone H1b. Indirect immunofluorescence studies using an anti-pH1b antibody revealed a punctate pattern of nuclear staining in parental and oncogene-transformed mouse fibroblasts (8Chadee D.N. Taylor W.R.

This pattern colocalized with the pattern observed when cells were stained with B1C8, an antibody raised against a human nuclear matrix protein that colocalizes with SC-35 domains and co-immunoprecipitates exon-containing RNA from in vitro splicing reactions (11Wan K.M. Nickerson J.A. Krockmalnic G. Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Blencowe W.J. Nickerson J.A. Issner R. Penman S. Sharp P.A. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 127: 593-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that there is a high degree of spatial association of specific actively transcribed genes with SC-35 domains, whereas the nontranscribed genes do not show preferential association (13Clemson C.M. Lawrence J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have therefore suggested that pH1b is complexed to transcriptionally active chromatin, which is localized near sites of RNA splicing (8Chadee D.N. Taylor W.R. Hurta R.A. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20098-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To investigate the relationship of H1 phosphorylation and transcriptionally active chromatin, we treated parental and ras-transformed 10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts with the transcription inhibitors actinomycin D and DRB. We monitored the level of pH1b by Western blotting with anti-pH1b, and we found that the inhibition of transcription in parental or ras-transformed mouse fibroblasts resulted in a decrease in the level of pH1b. To our surprise, we found that treatment of parental and ras-transformed cells with the replication inhibitor aphidicolin resulted in a marked decline in pH1b levels. The CIRAS-2 cell line was derived by transfection of 10T1/2 cells with the T-24 Ha-ras oncogene (14Egan S.E. McClarity G.A. Jarolim L. Wright J.A. Spiro I. Hager G. Greenberg A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). 10T1/2 and CIRAS-2 cell lines were maintained at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 7% CO2 in medium supplemented with penicillin G (100 units/ml) and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml). Cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY). Cells were plated in 15 ml of the above medium at 5 × 105 cells/150-mm diameter plastic tissue culture dish. Three days later the medium was replaced, and the cells were subjected to the various treatments described below. After treatment, the medium was removed, and the monolayer was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, and trypsinized. The cells were pelleted, and the pellet was stored at −80 °C. Mouse fibroblast 10T1/2 cells were subjected to the following treatments: (a) 10 μg/ml actinomycin D for 30 and 70 min, (b) 150 μM DRB for 30 min, 70 min, and 2 h, (c) 10 μM aphidicolin for 30 min, or (d) 150 μM DRB for 70 min. Then the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium without DRB, and the cells were allowed to recover for 2 h. CIRAS-2 cells were subjected to the same treatments as described above except the 150 μM DRB treatment was done for 2- and 3-h time periods. Cells (5 × 105) were seeded in 150-mm plastic tissue culture dishes and grown in 10% fetal bovine serum in α-minimal essential medium and harvested 72 h later by trypsinization. Approximately 4 × 107 to 1 × 108 cells were used for histone preparation. Cells were homogenized in 5 ml of nuclear preparation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.65% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min. All centrifugations were carried out at 4 °C. Nuclei were resuspended in 3 ml of RSB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaCl, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclei were extracted with 0.4 N H2SO4 and then with 5% perchloric acid to isolate H1 (15Davie J.R. Delcuve G.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The perchloric acid precipitate contained the nucleosomal histones. The supernatant was dialyzed with 0.1 N acetic acid and then distilled H20. The samples were lyophilized and resuspended in distilled H20. Proteins were analyzed by AUT (acetic acid, 6.7 M urea, 0.375% (w/v) Triton X-100)-15% polyacrylamide gels and SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue. Histones were separated by electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (8Chadee D.N. Taylor W.R. Hurta R.A. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20098-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The anti-pH1b IgG was isolated as described by Lu et al. (16Lu M.J. Dadd C.A. Mizzen C.A. Perry C.A. McLachlan D.R. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1994; 103: 111-121PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane containing H1 was immunochemically stained with the anti-pH1b IgG and goat anti-rabbit antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) using the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.). Equal amounts of protein were loaded on an SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. The relative amount of pH1b was determined by scanning the autoradiogram obtained from Western blots with anti-pH1b. A 325OE densitometer (Protein and DNA Imageware Systems, Huntington Station, NY) was used for scanning and densitometric analysis was performed using the Imagemaster 1-D software (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The relative level of pH1b in each sample was determined as described previously (8Chadee D.N. Taylor W.R. Hurta R.A. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20098-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and the values obtained for pH1b levels represent the average of three separate experiments. Actinomycin D at 10 μg/ml strongly inhibits RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase II transcription (17Perry R.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1963; 29: 400-406Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). 10T1/2 and CIRAS-2 cells were treated with 10 μg/ml actinomycin D for 30 and 70 min. H1 isolated from these cells was electrophoretically resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to membranes, and immunochemically stained with anti-pH1b. Fig. 1 (A and B) shows the position of migration of H1b, H1c, H1d, H1e, and H10 subtypes on an SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel. The relative level of pH1b in treated cells was compared with that of untreated cells and was determined as described previously (8Chadee D.N. Taylor W.R. Hurta R.A. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20098-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Incubation of 10T1/2 cells with 10 μg/ml actinomycin D resulted in a decrease in the level of pH1b equivalent to 0.12 ± 0.01 (n = 3) of the control after 30 min, whereas after 70 min the pH1b signal was undetectable. In the CIRAS-2 cells there was no decrease in the level of pH1b after 30 min; however, after 70 min the level was reduced to 0.20 ± 0.01 (n = 3). Transcriptionally active genes are often located near sites of RNA splicing (13Clemson C.M. Lawrence J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our previous observation of pH1b being co-localized with RNA splicing domains suggested to us that pH1b may be bound to transcriptionally active chromatin. The present data showing that levels of pH1b are dependent upon ongoing transcription adds further support for this association. The only other histone modification known to be dependent upon ongoing transcription is ubiquitination of histone H2B (18Davie J.R. Murphy L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4752-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The adenosine analog DRB selectively inhibits transcription by RNA polymerase II (19Codosh L.A. Fire A. Samuels M. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2250-2257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10T1/2 cells were treated with 150 μM DRB for 70 min and 2 h (Fig. 2). After 70 min the level of pH1b was reduced to 0.13 ± 0.01 (n = 3) of the control. The signal was undetectable after a 2-h treatment. CIRAS-2 cells were treated for 2- and 3-h time periods. Fig. 2 shows that after 2 h the level of pH1b was reduced to a level 0.53 ± 0.04 (n = 3) of that of the control, and this level remained the same even after a 3-h treatment. DRB is a reversible inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. We wanted to determine whether the level of pH1b was restored in the DRB-treated cells when DRB was removed. We incubated 10T1/2 cells in the presence of 150 μM DRB for 70 min and then removed the DRB containing medium and replaced it with fresh medium that did not contain DRB. The cells were allowed to recover for 2 h. Fig. 3 shows that after a 2-h period of time the level of pH1b had been restored. Aphidicolin is a potent inhibitor of DNA polymerase α and inhibits DNA replication (20Pedrali-Noy G. Spadari S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 88: 1194-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Arabshahi L. Brown N. Khan N. Wright G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5107-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 10T1/2 and CIRAS-2 cells were incubated for 30 and 70 min in the presence of 10 μM aphidicolin. Fig. 4 shows that inhibition of replication by aphidicolin resulted in a dramatic reduction in the level of pH1b after 30 min in both the 10T1/2 parental and the CIRAS-2-transformed cell lines. In 10T1/2 cells the level of pH1b was reduced to a level 0.08 ± 0.01 (n = 3) of that of the control and in CIRAS-2 cells to a level 0.23 ± 0.02 (n = 3) of that of the control after 30 min. Inhibition of replication results in a dramatic decrease in the level of pH1b. The effect of the phosphorylation of H1 on chromatin structure and chromatin replication has been investigated. Ajiro et al. have studied the phosphorylation sites of human histones H1A and H1B during the HeLa S-3 cell cycle (22Ajiro K. Buron T.W. Cohen L.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1445-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). They observed two different S phase phosphorylations, one that precedes and one that follows the onset of replication. This led to the suggestion that the phosphorylation of H1 at a particular site on the C-terminal may produce a chromatin conformation that permits DNA replication (22Ajiro K. Buron T.W. Cohen L.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1445-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Further evidence that supports the involvement of H1 phosphorylation in the regulation of chromatin structure during replication comes from studies done with salt-treated SV40 minichromosomes reconstituted with differentially phosphorylated forms of H1. The minichromosomes reconstituted with S phase H1 had a higher replication efficiency than those reconstituted with G0 or M phase H1 (23Halmer L. Gruss C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1420-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the chromatin structure induced by the phosphorylation of H1 affects the efficiency of replication. It has been determined that the accessibility of H1 to the H1 kinase is directly related to its position in the chromatin fiber and that H1 must be displaced from the chromatin fiber in order for it to be phosphorylated by an H1 kinase (24Jermanowski A. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8514-8520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription and replication processes may be the initial disruptive events that lead to the displacement of H1b from the chromatin fiber and render it accessible to the H1 kinase. Further H1 phosphorylation may then be required to maintain an open chromatin conformation for replication and transcription. It has been proposed that phosphorylation of H1 may be involved in inducing chromatin decondensation, thereby allowing access to factors for gene expression or replication in addition to chromatin condensation at mitosis (6Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 93-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We propose that when transcription or replication processes are inhibited, H1b is no longer exposed to the H1 kinase. Dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases would then reduce the steady state levels of pH1b. The effect of transcription and replication inhibition on pH1b levels in 10T1/2 and CIRAS-2 cells differs in terms of time to elicit reduced levels of pH1b. Both aphidicolin and actinomycin D or DRB take longer to act in the CIRAS-2 cells. The chromatin of ras-transformed mouse fibroblasts is less condensed than the chromatin of parental cells (8Chadee D.N. Taylor W.R. Hurta R.A. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20098-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Laitinen J. Sistonen L. Alitalo K. Holtta E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We proposed that oncogene activation of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway increases the activity of an H1 kinase, resulting in elevated levels of phosphorylated H1 and decondenstion of chromatin (8Chadee D.N. Taylor W.R. Hurta R.A. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20098-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This increased kinase activity and less condensed chromatin structure may contribute to the extended times required to observe a reduced level of pH1b when transcription or replication is inhibited. The extended response time to see a reduction in pH1b levels may also reflect a reduced protein phosphatase activity. Protein phosphatase 1 is thought to be responsible for dephosphorylating H1 (26Paulson J.R. Patzlaff J.S. Vallis A.J. J. Cell. Sci. 1996; 109: 1437-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase 1 activity is reduced when it is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases (27Dohadwala M. Da Cruz E. Silva E.F. Hall F.L. Williams R.T. Carbonaro-Hall D.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Berndt N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Thus, oncogene activation of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway may result in the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases and deactivation of protein phosphatase 1. In summary, we have demonstrated that the maintenance of levels of phosphorylated H1b in chromatin is dependent on ongoing transcription or replication. This observation suggests that pH1b is associated with transcriptionally active chromatin. Therefore, we propose that H1b phosphorylation may be required to maintain an open chromatin structure, thus facilitating subsequent rounds of transcription or replication."

We used seven DNA markers mapped to and around the APC and MCC genes to detect allelic imbalance. We observed a duplication of chromosome 5q sequences in 11 of 23 informative sporadic tumours and in 18 of 24 hereditary tumours. We determined a breakpoint cluster between the APC and MCC genes at chromosome 5q22. In addition we have found a partial duplication of the smallest overlapping region of about 1.5 Mb sequences including the MCC gene in seven tumours without visible alteration of chromosome 5q in the karyotype. We suggest that this DNA segment harbours a gene or gene cluster, the altered dosage of which is important for the growth of nonpapillary renal cell carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2316977957,"Evi5 is a common site of retroviral integration in T-cell lymphomas of AKXD mice. Mapping studies have localized Evi5 to a region approximately 18 kb upstream of another common viral integration site, Gfi1, on mouse chromosome 5 (Liao X, Jenkins NA and Copeland NG, (1995a). J. Virol., 69, 7132 – 7137). Gfi1 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor involved in interleukin-2 signaling. To determine if Evi5 encodes a gene separate from Gfi1 that might also be involved in T-cell disease, we have searched within the Evi5 locus for novel transcripts. A 6.0 kb transcript was identified in these studies that spans the Evi5 locus and is disrupted by viral integration at Evi5. This transcript is expressed in all embryonic and adult mouse tissues examined. While blast searches indicated that Evi5 is a novel gene, homologies were detected between Evi5 and a known oncogene, Tre2, as well as mammalian and yeast cell cycle regulatory proteins. Evi5 thus encodes a gene separate from Gfi1 that may also be involved in T-cell disease."

https://openalex.org/W1603461200,"The molecular mechanism (or mechanisms) at the basis of paraquat (PQ) (a widely used herbicide) toxicity is far from being fully understood. Until now, two main points of view have emerged: 1) PQ-related cell injuries could be mediated by toxic oxygen free radicals coming from the metabolism of the herbicide by the microsomal enzyme system, and/or 2) PQ, by inducing mitochondrial swelling and breakage, could cause troubles in cell energy charge, then driving the cell to death. Recently, some of cytoskeletal structures (microtubules and microfilaments) have been proposed as further PQ cell targets. The microfilament system in particular seems to be markedly affected by the herbicide, but so far no direct evidence associates PQ to actin damage. In this study, experimental data are presented concerning the direct effect of PQ on actin dynamics in solution. We demonstrate that actin selectively binds PQ; moreover, PQ induces the formation of actin sopramolecular structures in depolymerizing medium (G-buffer). Furthermore, by the interactions with F-actin cross-linking proteins (alpha-actinin and filamin), FITC-phalloidin, and myosin subfragment 1 (S1), it is demonstrated that PQ-induced actin aggregates are undoubtedly built up by F-actin. Electron micrographs showed that PQ-induced actin polymers are very short and tend to aggregate one to another. This mutual cohesion leads to the steric blockage of polymer growing ends as suggested by nucleated actin polymerization assays. Sonication, by releasing F-actin fragments from short polymer aggregates, allows actin polymer ends to regain their growing ability."
https://openalex.org/W1995997874,"The gene of a novel chymotrypsin-like serine protease has been cloned from human pancreas. The chymotrypsin-like enzyme-1 gene is located on chromosome 16q22.1 in a tight cluster with four unrelated genes. The gene has seven exons with the signal and activation peptide and the three main catalytic residues forming the active site encoded by separate exons. Northern blots of pancreatic mRNA showed a major transcript of 1.0 kilobases and a minor transcript of 1.3 kilobases due to alternative polyadenylation. No transcript was found in other tissues. Its presence in pancreatic tissue, duodenal juice, and urine was demonstrated with antisera raised against synthetic peptides from the derived amino acid sequence of the gene. The peptide sequences were chosen for being most dissimilar to chymotrypsin, and the antisera obtained did not react with purified human chymotrypsin. The proteolytically active CTRL-1 has been identified in pancreatic homogenate, duodenal juice, and urine, and a recombinant CTRL-1 has been characterized. Increased pancreatic secretion of CTRL-1 was induced by protease inhibitors indicating that the enzyme is secreted from pancreas upon feedback stimulation. Both native and recombinant CTRL-1 displayed chymotrypsin- and elastase-2-like activities and hydrolyzed the amide bonds of substrates having tyrosine, phenylalanine, or leucine residues at the P1 position. The enzyme was active over a broad pH range (6.5-9.0), with a maximum at pH 8.0-8.5. CTRL-1 was produced as a zymogen of 264 amino acids as deduced from the gene sequence, with a sequence identity of 54% with human chymotrypsin B. The number and location of intron/exon junctions as well as the sequence similarity to chymotrypsin both at the DNA and protein level and the presence in duodenal juice indicate that this is a novel digestive enzyme of the chymotrypsin superfamily, albeit one with distinct physiological and biochemical features.

INTRODUCTIONSerine proteases are enzymes utilizing an activated serine residue in their substrate binding site to catalyze the hydrolysis of certain peptide bonds. These proteases are encoded by related genes that evolved from a common ancestral protease through gene duplication (1Neurath H. Walsh K.A. Winter W.P. Science. 1967; 158: 1638-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 2de Haen C. Neurath H. Teller D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 92: 225-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The pancreatic subfamily of proteases comprises trypsins, chymotrypsins, kallikrein, and elastases. Their structural genes encode related enzymes of similar size, structure, and function but with different peptide bond specificities. The catalytic activity of chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1) is directed at peptide bonds involving aromatic, and to a lesser degree, aliphatic amino acids (3Sanders T.G. Rutter W.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 784-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Chymotrypsin is synthesized by pancreatic acinar cells as an inactive precursor (chymotrypsinogen) secreted to the duodenum and activated by tryptic cleavage. Two or three forms of chymotrypsin (5Coan II, M. Roberts R.C. Travis J. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2711-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Coan II, M. Travis J. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 379: 431-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Chymotrypsins are the most abundant among the pancreatic proteases and may represent 10-20% of the total protein synthesized by the exocrine pancreas (3Sanders T.G. Rutter W.J. J. Biol.

It contains the conserved sequences in the vicinity of the active site serine, aspartic acid, and histidine residues found in this family of serine proteases (25Brenner S. Nature. 1988; 334: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The pancreatic secretion of this proteinase is feedback-regulated.Previously, the genes for human and rat chymotrypsinogen B have been cloned and their amino acid sequences derived (26Tomita N.

A. 1983; 80: 7486-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) have been determined. The CTRL-1 gene is localized on chromosome 16q22.1 in a cluster with four unrelated genes (23Larsen F. Solheim J. Kristensen T. Kolstø A-B. Prydz H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The closest similarities (about 54% identity at the amino acid level) are found with the human chymotrypsin B, compared with 82-88% identity among the chymotrypsins themselves (26Tomita N. Izumoto Y. Horii A. Doi S. Yokouchi H. Ogawa M. Mori T. Matsubara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).The antibodies raised against peptides derived from the cDNA sequence allowed detection of the expressed gene product in pancreas as well as in duodenal juice after inhibitor instillation. The inhibitor mixture used is known from previous experiments to prevent the presence of intraduodenal activities of both trypsin and chymotrypsin and to induce an enhanced secretion of pancreatic proteolytic enzymes (25Brenner S. Nature. 1988; 334: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). This suggests that the enzyme is part of an inhibitor-induced pancreatic backup system of proteases. The antigen had the expected Mr and peptidolytic activity. The antibodies raised against the peptides from the derived amino acid sequence did not react with human chymotrypsin. The antigen was absent or present only at very low levels in duodenal juice harvested under basal conditions.We have shown that the CTRL-1 protein has peptidolytic activity that is significantly different from that of chymotrypsin. The activity ratio of chymotrypsin:CTRL-1 varies with the substrate used. CTRL-1 is clearly more active against peptides with tyrosine, leucine, or phenylalanine in the P1 position, apparently further enhanced by proline in the P2 position. The differences between chymotrypson and CTRL-1 are most pronounced when benzoyl-Arg-Val-Trp-pNA (tryptophan in the P1 position) or benzoyl-Lys-Val-Tyr-pNA (valine in the P2 position) is the substrate. CTRL-1 seems to prefer leucine in P1 or the combination of tyrosine in P1 and proline in P2. The results of the peptidolytic assays with enzyme in solution or those that are solid phase bound are not really comparable. In the solid phase assays, the endogenous anti-chymotrypsin-reactive material of each patient was used, whereas the enzyme in solution was commercial chymotrypsin B. The antibody and the solid phase state of the enzyme may affect CTRL-1 and the various chymotrypsins differently. It is therefore not surprising that the activity ratios show differences.Because it is being expressed in pancreas and is present in intestinal fluid after stimulation of pancreatic secretion, it is highly likely that the CTRL-1 protein is a novel digestive enzyme. It is not the human homologue of bovine chymotrypsinogen A. The enzyme reported here may represent a new kind of pancreatic chymotrypsin-like enzymes. The Northern analysis and the number of positive clones in the cDNA library (0.2%) suggest the presence of abundant transcripts of the gene. The gene organization, similar to that of rat chymotrypsin B, as well as the fact that the protein is produced solely in pancreas and that the deduced protein sequence shows highest similarity to the chymotrypsins make it reasonable to classify this as a novel chymotrypsin-like enzyme. Accordingly, the name chymotrypsin-like enzyme-1 and the symbol CTRL-1 have been assigned to it.

A. 1983; 80: 7486-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) have been determined. The CTRL-1 gene is localized on chromosome 16q22.1 in a cluster with four unrelated genes (23Larsen F. Solheim J. Kristensen T. Kolstø A-B. Prydz H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The closest similarities (about 54% identity at the amino acid level) are found with the human chymotrypsin B, compared with 82-88% identity among the chymotrypsins themselves (26Tomita N. Izumoto Y. Horii A. Doi S. Yokouchi H. Ogawa M. Mori T. Matsubara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The antibodies raised against peptides derived from the cDNA sequence allowed detection of the expressed gene product in pancreas as well as in duodenal juice after inhibitor instillation. The inhibitor mixture used is known from previous experiments to prevent the presence of intraduodenal activities of both trypsin and chymotrypsin and to induce an enhanced secretion of pancreatic proteolytic enzymes (25Brenner S. Nature. 1988; 334: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). This suggests that the enzyme is part of an inhibitor-induced pancreatic backup system of proteases. The antigen had the expected Mr and peptidolytic activity. The antibodies raised against the peptides from the derived amino acid sequence did not react with human chymotrypsin. The antigen was absent or present only at very low levels in duodenal juice harvested under basal conditions. We have shown that the CTRL-1 protein has peptidolytic activity that is significantly different from that of chymotrypsin. The activity ratio of chymotrypsin:CTRL-1 varies with the substrate used. CTRL-1 is clearly more active against peptides with tyrosine, leucine, or phenylalanine in the P1 position, apparently further enhanced by proline in the P2 position. The differences between chymotrypson and CTRL-1 are most pronounced when benzoyl-Arg-Val-Trp-pNA (tryptophan in the P1 position) or benzoyl-Lys-Val-Tyr-pNA (valine in the P2 position) is the substrate. CTRL-1 seems to prefer leucine in P1 or the combination of tyrosine in P1 and proline in P2. The results of the peptidolytic assays with enzyme in solution or those that are solid phase bound are not really comparable. In the solid phase assays, the endogenous anti-chymotrypsin-reactive material of each patient was used, whereas the enzyme in solution was commercial chymotrypsin B. The antibody and the solid phase state of the enzyme may affect CTRL-1 and the various chymotrypsins differently. It is therefore not surprising that the activity ratios show differences. Because it is being expressed in pancreas and is present in intestinal fluid after stimulation of pancreatic secretion, it is highly likely that the CTRL-1 protein is a novel digestive enzyme. It is not the human homologue of bovine chymotrypsinogen A. The enzyme reported here may represent a new kind of pancreatic chymotrypsin-like enzymes. The Northern analysis and the number of positive clones in the cDNA library (0.2%) suggest the presence of abundant transcripts of the gene. The gene organization, similar to that of rat chymotrypsin B, as well as the fact that the protein is produced solely in pancreas and that the deduced protein sequence shows highest similarity to the chymotrypsins make it reasonable to classify this as a novel chymotrypsin-like enzyme. Accordingly, the name chymotrypsin-like enzyme-1 and the symbol CTRL-1 have been assigned to it. We thank Dr. Tom Kristensen and Dr. Marianne Wright for sequencing the cDNA clones and Dr. Jarle Nordheim for the tissue samples."
https://openalex.org/W2324946049,"We have examined the role of the AP-1 transcription factor on thymocyte maturation and thymus architecture by overexpressing FosB2 in transgenic mice. FosB2 is a naturally occurring splice variant of the FosB2 gene, encoding a truncated protein which lacks two domains necessary for transcriptional activation. The expression of FosB2 in the thymocytes severely affected their maturation and the structure of the whole thymus: the phenotype developed slowly during the first months of life, resulting in a progressive expansion of the medulla and concomitant reduction of the cortex. CD4+ thymocytes represented the major thymocyte population, whereas the CD4+ 8+ thymocytes were virtually absent. This phenotype appeared to be an intrinsic property of bone marrow derived cells, as it could be reproduced in bone marrow chimaeric mice. This pathology was very reminiscent to that observed in mice overexpressing c-Fos in thymic epithelium: also in that case the thymus underwent with age a progressive expansion of the epithelium and major changes in the ratio of thymocyte subsets, but the phenotype appeared to be an intrinsic property of the epithelial cells since it could not be reproduced by transgenic bone marrow transplantation. We speculate that both overexpression of FosB2 in thymocytes and overexpression of c-Fos in thymic epithelium results in aberrant signaling between thymocytes and stroma, that ultimately alters the thymic micromilieu, leading to this severe pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2080047577,"Genetic deletions to chromosome 10 have been extensively documented for human glioblastomas (GBMs). To identify gene products that may be involved in malignant progression, a subtractive hybridization was performed between GBM cells and hybrid cells suppressed for tumorigenicity following microcell transfer of chromosome 10. One novel cDNA isolated from this subtraction showed consistent upregulation (approximately 4 to 10-fold) that correlated with the nontumorigenic phenotype of the hybrid cells. Subsequent analysis resulted in the identification of a full length cDNA (2,569 bp) termed RIG (regulated in glioma). RIG expression was either not detected or detected only at low levels in cultured glioma cells and primary glioblastoma specimens compared to normal brain cells. The 2.6 kb RIG mRNA was expressed predominantly in normal brain with lower levels in heart and lung. Sequence analysis showed no significant homology to known gene products. Genomic alterations of RIG were present in approximately 25% of glioma cell lines examined. Also, RIG mapped to chromosome 11p15.1, a region that is known to be altered in malignant astrocytomas. The differential expression pattern, tissue distribution and chromosomal location of RIG suggests it serves as a molecular marker for or may play a role in the malignant progression of GBMs."
https://openalex.org/W2145168493,Optical spectra of comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1) at a heliocentric distance of 6.45 astronomical units showed emission from cyanogen gas. The spatial distribution of cyanogen was considerably more diffuse and extended compared to the spatial profile of the dust or grains which were sharply peaked near the center. This behavior is consistent with comets at smaller heliocentric distances suggesting the same or a similar formation mechanism. A cyanogen gas production rate of (1.2 ± 0.3) ×1026 molecules per second was derived. A model band profile derived from fluorescence equilibrium calculations for the comet's heliocentric velocity and distance agrees with the observed band profile.
