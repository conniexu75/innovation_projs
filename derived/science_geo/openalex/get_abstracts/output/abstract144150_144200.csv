https://openalex.org/W1997301069,"Agricultural productivity is severely affected by soil salinity. One possible mechanism by which plants could survive salt stress is to compartmentalize sodium ions away from the cytosol. Overexpression of a vacuolar Na+/H+ antiport from Arabidopsis thaliana in Arabidopsis plants promotes sustained growth and development in soil watered with up to 200 millimolar sodium chloride. This salinity tolerance was correlated with higher-than-normal levels of AtNHX1 transcripts, protein, and vacuolar Na+/H+ (sodium/proton) antiport activity. These results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering salt tolerance in plants."
https://openalex.org/W1996320813,"Theory predicts low niche differentiation between species over evolutionary time scales, but little empirical evidence is available. Reciprocal geographic predictions based on ecological niche models of sister taxon pairs of birds, mammals, and butterflies in southern Mexico indicate niche conservatism over several million years of independent evolution (between putative sister taxon pairs) but little conservatism at the level of families. Niche conservatism over such time scales indicates that speciation takes place in geographic, not ecological, dimensions and that ecological differences evolve later."
https://openalex.org/W1992303064,"The epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are products of cytochrome P450 epoxygenases that have vasodilatory properties similar to that of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. The cytochrome P450 isoform CYP2J2 was cloned and identified as a potential source of EETs in human endothelial cells. Physiological concentrations of EETs or overexpression of CYP2J2 decreased cytokine-induced endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression, and EETs prevented leukocyte adhesion to the vascular wall by a mechanism involving inhibition of transcription factor NF-kappaB and IkappaB kinase. The inhibitory effects of EETs were independent of their membrane-hyperpolarizing effects, suggesting that these molecules play an important nonvasodilatory role in vascular inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2076129653,"Pig organs may offer a solution to the shortage of human donor organs for transplantation, but concerns remain about possible cross-species transmission of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV). Samples were collected from 160 patients who had been treated with various living pig tissues up to 12 years earlier. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein immunoblot analyses were performed on serum from all 160 patients. No viremia was detected in any patient. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 159 of the patients were analyzed by PCR using PERV-specific primers. No PERV infection was detected in any of the patients from whom sufficient DNA was extracted to allow complete PCR analysis (97 percent of the patients). Persistent microchimerism (presence of donor cells in the recipient) was observed in 23 patients for up to 8.5 years."
https://openalex.org/W2022720058,"With the use of a large collection of free-oscillation data and additional constraints imposed by the free-air gravity anomaly, lateral variations in shear velocity, compressional velocity, and density within the mantle; dynamic topography on the free surface; and topography on the 660-km discontinuity and the core-mantle boundary were determined. The velocity models are consistent with existing models based on travel-time and waveform inversions. In the lowermost mantle, near the core-mantle boundary, denser than average material is found beneath regions of upwellings centered on the Pacific Ocean and Africa that are characterized by slow shear velocities. These anomalies suggest the existence of compositional heterogeneity near the core-mantle boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2008487994,"The total measured rate of alluvial sediment accretion in the agricultural Coon Creek Basin for the period 1975-93 was only about 6 percent of the rate that occurred in the 1930s, but the distributed changes within the basin were highly variable and systematic. Sediment yield (efflux), however, remained relatively constant despite large stream and valley changes within the basin. These observations demonstrate (i) that sediment sources, sinks, and fluxes vary widely over time and space and (ii) that, although improved soil conservation measures have decreased soil erosion, the downstream effects are complex."
https://openalex.org/W2020949713,"Candida albicans, the most prevalent fungal pathogen in humans, is thought to lack a sexual cycle. A set of C. albicans genes has been identified that corresponds to the master sexual cycle regulators a1, alpha1, and alpha2 of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating-type (MAT) locus. The C. albicans genes are arranged in a way that suggests that these genes are part of a mating type-like locus that is similar to the mating-type loci of other fungi. In addition to the transcriptional regulators a1, alpha1, and alpha2, the C. albicans mating type-like locus contains several genes not seen in other fungal MAT loci, including those encoding proteins similar to poly(A) polymerases, oxysterol binding proteins, and phosphatidylinositol kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2092317255,"The intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species, together with the thioredoxin and glutathione systems, is thought to participate in redox signaling in mammalian cells. The activity of thioredoxin is dependent on the redox status of thioredoxin reductase (TR), the activity of which in turn is dependent on a selenocysteine residue. Two mammalian TR isozymes (TR2 and TR3), in addition to that previously characterized (TR1), have now been identified in humans and mice. All three TR isozymes contain a selenocysteine residue that is located in the penultimate position at the carboxyl terminus and which is encoded by a UGA codon. The generation of reactive oxygen species in a human carcinoma cell line was shown to result in both the oxidation of the selenocysteine in TR1 and a subsequent increase in the expression of this enzyme. These observations identify the carboxyl-terminal selenocysteine of TR1 as a cellular redox sensor and support an essential role for mammalian TR isozymes in redox-regulated cell signaling.

Excessive production of ROS or an insufficiency of antioxidant defenses has been implicated in apoptosis, aging, and cancer (1Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence indicates that, at low concentrations, ROS mediate regulatory events and are essential participants in cell signaling (2Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2311) Google Scholar). Redox signaling is thought to be achieved through the coupling of ROS with oxidation-reduction processes that involve essential thiol groups in proteins, resulting in the modulation of tyrosine or serine-threonine phosphorylation of target proteins (3Finkel T.

The redox state of essential thiol groups is controlled by two cellular redox systems: the thioredoxin (thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase (designated TR herein, but it should be noted that TrxR has also been used, e.g. see Ref. 5Arscott L.D.

The activities of these proteins are regulated by thioredoxin; reduced thioredoxin activates the phosphatase and peroxidase, and inactivates the kinase (12Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K.

Thioredoxin is a 12-kDa protein that catalyzes the reduction of protein disulfides and regulates a variety of processes including reduction of ribonucleotide reductase, protein-DNA interactions, and cellular growth (9Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). The redox state and activity of thioredoxin are in turn controlled by TR, a selenocysteine-containing flavoprotein composed of two identical 57-kDa subunits. The selenocysteine residue is located at the penultimate COOH-terminal position of TR, is encoded by a UGA codon (15Gasdaska P.Y. Gasdaska J.R. Cochran S. Powis G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 8520-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). TR is a member of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family of enzymes, but other members of this family lack the COOH-terminal extension containing the selenocysteine residue (15Gasdaska P.Y. Gasdaska J.R. Cochran S. Powis G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The reactivity of TR with various alkylating agents, quinones, and gold-containing organic compounds is about 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of these other enzymes (for example, glutathione reductase and lipoamide dehydrogenase) (5Arscott L.D.

The inactivation of TR by such compounds has been attributed to the irreversible modification of the selenocysteine residue (6Zhong L. Arner E.S.J. Ljung J. Aslund F. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8581-8591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 7Gromer S. Arscott L.D. Williams Jr., C.H. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. J. Biol.

Selenium is a better nucleophile than sulfur and, under physiological conditions, selenocysteine residues are ionized whereas cysteines are typically protonated (20Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Park J. Park S.I. Chittum H.S. Baek H.J. Carlson B.A. Yang E.S. Moustafa M.E. Lee B.J. Comprehensive Natural Products Chem. 1999; 4: 353-380Crossref Google Scholar,21Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). These properties render selenocysteine a promising candidate for an ROS sensor in proteins. Indeed, several selenoproteins (including TR) and selenium compounds exhibit affinity for hydroperoxides and oxygen radicals (22Bjornstedt M. Xue J. Huang W. Akesson B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29382-29384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23May J.M. Cobb C.E. Mendiratta S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Biol.

Bull. 1998; 21: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We have tested whether selenocysteine in mammalian thioredoxin reductase may be involved in redox regulation of cell signaling. We initially identified two new thioredoxin reductases, TR2 and TR3, and found that all three mammalian thioredoxin reductases conserve the COOH-terminal penultimate selenocysteine residue. We further found that, when cells generated ROS, selenocysteine in TR1 was oxidized while TR1 expression was elevated. The data suggest that the selenocysteine residue in thioredoxin reductases serves as a cellular redox sensor. Recombinant human thioredoxin was obtained from American Diagnostica; recombinant Escherichia coli thioredoxin, hydrogen peroxide, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB) and NADPH from Sigma; 5-IAF and anti-fluorescein antibodies from Molecular Probes; pre-cast NuPAGE polyacrylamide gels and immunoblot system from Novex; ADP-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and DEAE-Sepharose from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; C18 and phenyl-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) columns from TosoHaas; mouse and human expressed sequence tag clones for TR1, TR2, and TR3 from Research Genetics, Genome Systems, and ATCC; mouse tissues from Pel-Freez; and mouse multiple tissue Northern blot from CLONTECH. Other reagents were of the highest grade available. To obtain75Se-labeled tissues, we injected mice with 0.2 mCi of [75Se]selenite (specific radioactivity 1000 Ci/mmol; University of Missouri Research Reactor) 2 days before tissue removal as described (25Gladyshev V.N. Factor V.M. Housseau F. Hatfield D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin reductases were purified from75Se-labeled mouse liver and testis according to the previously published procedure (16Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), which consisted of the subsequent anion-exchange (DEAE-Sepharose), affinity (ADP-Sepharose), and hydrophobic-interaction (phenyl-Sepharose or phenyl-HPLC column) chromatographic procedures. To distinguish between TR isozymes, we assumed that, on the basis of the deduced protein sequences, TR3 is more basic than is either TR1 or TR2, and that the molecular mass of TR2 is higher than that of TR1 or TR3. Indeed, during purification, TR1, TR2, and TR3 had different affinities for DEAE-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose columns. Purification yielded homogenous preparations of 75Se-labeled liver TR1, testis TR1, testis TR2, and liver TR3. The enzymes were detected during purification by their TR catalytic activities as described by Tamura and Stadtman (17Tamura T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), by the presence of 75Se in fractions analyzed with a 5-detector Wallac γ-counter and by immunoblot assays. Rabbit antibodies specific for TR1 were generated against two keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptides corresponding to residues 383–400 and 486–499 of human TR1, with the exception that selenocysteine 498 and cysteine 497 were replaced with serines. Rabbit antibodies specific for TR2 were generated in response to a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide corresponding to residues 560–579 of human TR2, with the exception that selenocysteine was replaced with cysteine. Chicken antibodies specific for TR3 were generated in response to a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide corresponding to residues 502–520 of human TR3. The procedure for alkylation by 5-IAF of highly reactive, ROS-sensitive thiol or selenol groups in cell extracts was adapted from Wu et al. (26Wu Y. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Nearly confluent A431 cells were incubated for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum (FBS), washed once with DMEM containing 0.1% FBS, and then incubated either for 0–45 min with EGF (500 ng/ml) in the same medium (Fig. 3 C) or for 4 h in the same medium containing 100 μCi of [75Se]selenite (Fig. 3 D). The cells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline and frozen in liquid nitrogen. They were subsequently harvested at 4 °C by scraping, under anaerobic conditions, into an oxygen-free lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), 0.1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40 detergent, and 0.04% NaN3. Freshly prepared 5-IAF was added to a final concentration of 20 μm before scraping. The cell lysate was incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C for 20 min, after which the alkylation reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol.Figure 3Role of TR1 in redox regulation of cell signaling. A, alkylation of NADPH-reduced, but not of oxidized, TR1 by 5-IAF. NADPH-reduced or oxidized TR1 was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C in the presence or absence of 20 μm5-IAF, and was then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to TR1 (upper panel) or to fluorescein (lower panel). B, oxidation by hydrogen peroxide of NADPH-reduced TR1 in vitro.75Se-Labeled TR1 was reduced for 10 min with 100 μm NADPH, oxidized for 10 min with the indicated concentration of H2O2, and then incubated for 10 min with 20 μm 5-IAF. The protein was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and either immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for TR1 (top panel) or for fluorescein (bottom panel), or to PhosphorImager analysis of75Se (middle panel). C, effect of stimulation of A431 cells with EGF on the redox state of TR1 in vivo. Serum-deprived A431 cells were incubated with EGF (500 ng/ml) for the indicated times, after which cell lysates were prepared under anaerobic conditions and incubated for 20 min with 20 μm 5-IAF. TR1 was then isolated from reacted cell lysates using ADP-Sepharose and analyzed by immunoblot assay with antibodies to either TR1 or fluorescein. D, co-elution of75Se-labeled and 5-IAF-targeted tryptic peptides of TR1. A431 cells were incubated with [75Se]selenite for 4 h, after which cell lysates were prepared under anaerobic conditions and exposed for 20 min to 20 μm 5-IAF. TR1 was then isolated from the lysates and digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC. Absorbance at 214 nm (upper panel) and 440 nm (middle panel) was used to detect peptides and fluorescein, respectively. The lower panel shows the75Se radioactivity profile. E, specific alkylation of selenocysteine in TR1 by 5-IAF. Fraction 56 from D, containing both 75Se and fluorescein, was subjected to mass spectrometry analysis to determine the mass of the peptide, followed by amino acid sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry. The experimentally determined mass for the 5-IAF-labeled peptide in fraction 56, [M + 2H]2+ = 779.73, matched the predicted mass for the COOH-terminal tryptic peptide of TR1 that is modified with a single 5-IAF group (shown as circled F) and a single iodoacetamide group (shown as circled A), [M + 2H]2+ = 779.48. This double-charged ion was completely fragmented and is not seen in this figure. yn and bn are the ions in which amino acid residues are sequentially cleaved from the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal, respectively. Importantly, the y2 ion defines the selenocysteine-glycine COOH-terminal dipeptide modified with 5-IAF, and the b10 ion defines the SGASILQAGC peptide containing cysteine that is not modified with 5-IAF. Neither the corresponding y2 ion containing unmodified selenocysteine nor b10 ion containing a 5-IAF-modified cysteine were detected. This suggests that selenocysteine was modified, but cysteine was not, with 5-IAF. The predicted molecular masses for fragment ions of types b and y are shown under the sequence, and ions observed in the spectrum are underlined.m/z, mass/charge ratio. F, effects of stimulation of A431 cells with EGF or H2O2 on the expression of TR1. Cells were incubated for 4 h in the absence (control) or presence of EGF (500 ng/ml) or 0.2 mm H2O2, after which cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to TR1 or to thioredoxin (Trx). G, effects of stimulation of A431 cells with EGF or H2O2 on the abundance of75Se-labeled TR1, GPX1, and GPX4. Cells were labeled with [75Se]selenite in the absence (control) or presence of EGF (500 ng/ml) or 0.2 mm H2O2 for 4 h, after which cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis of 75Se-labeled proteins. TR3 is less abundant than TR1 and is not apparent on this figure.H, effect of DNCB on the intracellular abundance of TR1. A431 cells were incubated for 4 h with [75Se]selenite and the indicated concentrations of DNCB, after which cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis of 75Se-labeled proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After reaction with 5-IAF, the cell lysate was dialyzed against a solution containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), and aprotinin (2 μg/ml), and TR1 was isolated from the dialysate by chromatography on ADP-Sepharose and DEAE-Sepharose columns. The purified enzyme was characterized by SDS-PAGE, PhosphorImager analysis of 75Se, and immunoblot analysis with antibodies to TR1 or to fluorescein. The 5-IAF-modified enzyme (50 μg) was then further reduced with dithiothreitol in the presence of guanidine HCl, reacted with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 narrow-bore column with a gradient of acetonitrile as described previously (16Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The protein mixture contained in the ADP-Sepharose flow-through fraction, which was obtained during TR1 purification, was also digested with trypsin in parallel with TR1, and the resulting peptides were separated on a C18 column under conditions identical to those used for fractionation of the TR1 tryptic digest. This TR1-deficient sample served as a control for the TR1 sample. The eluted peptides from the TR1 sample (Fig. 3 D) and the TR1-deficient sample were detected by measurement of absorbance at 214 and 440 nm; absorbance at the latter wavelength was used to identify fluorescein-containing peptides. Only one major fluorescein-containing peak (fractions 56 and 57) was detected for the TR1 tryptic digest. This peak was not present in the fractions obtained from the control digest of the TR1-deficient sample, whereas several smaller peaks of absorbance at 440 nm present in the TR1 digest (Fig. 3 D) were also apparent in the digest of the TR1-deficient sample. Fractions from the TR1 sample were analyzed for the presence of 75Se with a γ-counter, and two peaks containing 75Se were detected (Fig.3 D). The fractions containing 75Se (39 and 56) were subjected to electrospray tandem mass-spectrometric analysis, which detected the COOH-terminal peptide in fraction 39 and the 5-IAF-labeled COOH-terminal peptide in fraction 56. A431 cells were cultured in the presence of 10% FBS to near-confluence and then incubated in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS for 16 h. The serum-deprived cells were washed once with DMEM containing 0.1% FBS, and then incubated for 4 h in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS and 20 μCi of [75Se]selenite, and in the absence (control) or presence of either EGF (500 ng/ml), 0.2 mmH2O2, or 10–30 μm DNCB. Cells were then washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping in a lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, sodium vanadate (2 mg/ml), 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.04% NaN3. The cells were sonicated and the resulting lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min, after which the supernatant (3 μg of protein) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and either immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for TR1 or PhosphorImager analysis. Only one mammalian TR isoform (TR1) has been identified to date (15Gasdaska P.Y. Gasdaska J.R. Cochran S. Powis G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We searched the human and mouse dbEST data bases with human and rat TR1 sequences and found several homologous human and mouse sequences. We determined the sequences of the corresponding cDNAs by nucleotide sequencing of expressed sequence tag clones, and identified two new TRs (TR2 and TR3) in humans and mice (Fig. 1, A and B). The deduced sequences of the three TR isozymes share >50% identity and show conservation of all functional motifs, including two active-site redox cysteines in the NH2-terminal region, the NADPH- and FAD-binding residues, and a dimer interface domain (Fig. 1, A and B). The 3′-untranslated region sequences of all human and mouse TR isozyme mRNAs contain selenocysteine insertion sequence elements (data not shown) that are characteristic of all mammalian selenoproteins (27Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The TR isozymes are predicted to contain a selenocysteine residue encoded by UGA in a conserved COOH-terminal GCUG sequence (U, selenocysteine) (Fig. 1, B and C). For human proteins, TR3 displays 52–53% identity with either TR1 or TR2, while the latter two proteins are 70% identical. This suggests a closer evolutional link between TR1 and TR2, while TR3 is more distantly related to TR1 and TR2. Computer search analysis of the non-redundant data base with the human cDNA sequence revealed matches to the previously determined genomic DNA sequences (accession numbers AC000078, AC000080, AC000090) and the complete human TR3 gene sequence was derived from these sequences. The human TR3 gene spans ∼65 kilobases in the DiGeorge region on chromosome 22q11.2 and has an unusual gene structure. The 5′-end of this gene, including 5′-untranslated region and the beginning of the open reading frame, overlaps in different orientations with the 5′-untranslated region of the membrane-bound catechol O-methyltransferase gene (data not shown). The physiological significance of this overlap and the possible relevance of TR3 to DiGeorge syndrome will require further studies. Northern (RNA) hybridization and analysis of 75Se-labeled mouse proteins suggested that TR1 and TR3 are expressed in a variety of tissues, being especially abundant in liver, whereas TR2 is preferentially expressed in testis (Fig.2, A and B). We therefore directly purified to homogeneity, from75Se-labeled mouse tissues, TR1 from mouse liver and testis, TR2 from mouse testis, and TR3 from mouse liver (Fig.2 C). The identities of all TR isozymes were confirmed by immunoblot analysis with isozyme-specific antibodies to TR1, TR2, and TR3, and by comparison of the sequences of tryptic peptides with the predicted TR1, TR2, and TR3 amino acid sequences (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to TR1 and TR3 which migrated as ∼57-kDa species on SDS-PAGE gels, TR2 had a higher, ∼65-kDa, molecular mass (Fig.2 C) that is consistent with the coding region derived from the cDNA sequence. TR1 exists in the cytoplasm (28Rozell B. Hansson H.A. Luthman M. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 79-86PubMed Google Scholar). TR3 has a putative mitochondrial signal (the enrichment of arginines in the NH2-terminal structure that forms an α-helix) (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that it may be a mitochondrial enzyme. The experimentally determined NH2-terminal sequence of mouse liver TR3 is GGQQSFDLLV, indicating the post-translational processing of first 34 residues. This processing is consistent with the apparently similar mobility of mouse liver TR1 and TR3 on SDS-PAGE gels. Thioredoxin reductase has recently been isolated from mitochondria, and the properties of the enzyme are different from those of TR1 (29Rigobello M.P. Callegaro M.T. Barzon E. Benetti M. Bindoli A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is possible that three mammalian TRs have related functions in different cellular compartments.

Specifically, we examined the effect of ROS on the redox state of TR1, which we monitored by alkylating thiol and selenol groups in the enzyme with 5-IAF and subsequently detecting fluorescein-modified protein by immunoblot analysis (26Wu Y. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We initially confirmed that purified mouse liver TR1 did not react with 5-IAF, whereas the NADPH-reduced form of the enzyme was alkylated by this compound (Fig. 3 A). Thus, changes in the fluorescein content of 5-IAF-treated TR1 reflect the redox state of the enzyme. With this approach, we further tested whether incubation of NADPH-reduced TR1 with hydrogen peroxide leads to oxidation of the enzyme. In the presence of 5-IAF, oxidation of the enzyme would be reflected by the decreased level of fluor"

GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli strain, purified from bacterial lysates on glutathione-agarose beads and used in pull-down experiments. Mint, CASK, and NC proteins were expressed in COS7 cells by DEAE-dextran transfection (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.42-16.44Google Scholar). 72 h after transfection, cells were collected and solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in extraction buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm imidazole, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDDT, and protease inhibitors. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the corresponding GST fusion protein. Beads were washed three times with the extraction buffer, and attached proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed with the anti-Mint1 polyclonal antibody or monoclonal anti-HA.11 (Berkley Antibody Company) and anti-FLAG-M5 (Sigma) antibodies using ECL (Pierce) detection method. Anti-Mint1 polyclonal antibody, raised against full-length GST-Mint1, was described previously (13Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar); anti-NN antibody was raised against rat α1Bamino-terminal peptide (MVRFELGDGGRYGG). Rat brain synaptosomes (P2) were prepared as described (15Jones D.H. Matus A.I. Biochim. Biophys.

The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g (TL-100), and the samples of brain lysate were prelabeled with 0.5 nm125I-ω-GVIA conotoxin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C as described previously (10Leveque C. el Far O. Martin-Moutot N. Sato K. Kato R. Takahashi M. Seagar M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6306-6312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The prelabeled extracts were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coated with anti-Mint1 or anti-NN polyclonal antibodies or corresponding preimmune sera. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with 5-fold diluted extraction buffer, and 125I radioactivity in the pellet was quantified by γ counting. To define specific regions of channel sequence that may potentially mediate the interactions of synaptic Ca2+ channels with cytosolic proteins, we performed primary sequence alignment of carboxyl-terminal regions of human α1B (N-type), α1A (P/Q-type, abbreviated as Q-type), and α1E (R-type) subunits (12Williams M.E.

Three aligned sequences were highly conserved for the period of about 200 amino acids following the last transmembrane region (TMR-IVS6) and then sharply deviated from each other for most of the remaining sequence (Fig.1 A). We identified two conserved patches embedded within this highly variable region. The first conserved region is enriched with proline residues and contains a number of potential SH3-domain binding motifs P XX P (18Feng S. Chen J.K., Yu, H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). This region encompasses the part of the channel that has been recently implicated in modulatory interactions with G-protein βγ subunits (19Qin N. Platano D. Olcese R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8866-8871Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and with auxiliary β subunits (20Walker D. Bichet D. Campbell K.P. De Waard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2361-2367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The second conserved region is the very carboxyl terminus of neuronal Ca2+ channels pore-forming subunits (Fig. 1 A), all of which end with D XX C-COOH motif. PDZ domains bind to carboxyl termini of target proteins (1Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and we reasoned that the conserved D XX C-COOH motif may correspond to a novel PDZ domain binding consensus sequence. To identify a PDZ domain that associates with the conserved D XX C-COOH motif, we examined the interaction of NC4 bait with a prey library of PDZ domains in liquid yeast two-hybrid assays. PDZ domains of PSD93, SAP102, PSD95, NOS, GRIP, Z01, Dlg, spinophilin, CASK, and Mint1 were tested. The strongest interaction of NC4 bait was observed with the first PDZ domain of Mint-1 (Mint1-1). Mint1 (13Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) is a modular adapter protein containing a Munc18-interacting domain (MI), a CASK-interacting domain (CI), a PTB domain, and two “orphan” PDZ domains for which ligands have not yet been identified (Fig. 1 B). A strong association of NC4 bait with Mint1-1 domain was observed (553 ± 36 arbitrary units, n= 3; Fig. 1 B), whereas binding to the Mint1-2 domain was significantly weaker (197 ± 52 arbitrary units, n= 3). As expected for PDZ domain-mediated association (1Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. Kennedy M.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), the interaction with Mint1-1 is critically dependent on the most carboxyl-terminal region of the channel sequence, as Mint1-1 does not bind to truncated NC4-D2334X protein and mutated NC4-W2338A protein (Trp2338 → Ala) (Fig. 1 B). Mint1-1 did not bind to the NMDA receptor and neurexin 1α carboxyl-terminal baits (Fig. 1 B). To independently test for the ability of the carboxyl termini of N-type Ca2+ channels to bind Mint1, we expressed full-length Mint1 in COS cells and performed pull-down experiments with GST-NC4 protein. Anti-Mint1 antibody detected an immunoreactive band with an apparent molecular weight corresponding to Mint1 in samples incubated with recombinant GST-NC4, but not with GST alone or with GST-NC4-D2334X (Fig. 1 C). Interaction of Mint1 with GST-NC4 could be disrupted by addition of 1 mm competitive synthetic peptide HPDQDHWC (Fig. 1 C), corresponding to the eight carboxyl-terminal amino acids of α1B sequence. In a complementary series of experiments, we expressed an HA-tagged NC4 protein (HA-NC4) in COS cells and determined that GST-Mint1-PDZ1–2, but not GST alone or GST-Mint1-PTB, precipitated an anti-HA immunoreactive band from the COS cell lysate (Fig. 1 D). In agreement with the yeast two-hybrid data (Fig. 1 B), GST-Mint1-PDZ1–2 did not precipitate HA-NC4-D2334X or HA-NC4-W2338A mutant proteins from the COS cell lysate (Fig. 1 D). To determine an ability of N-type Ca2+ channels to associate with Mint1 in vivo, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with rat brain synaptosomes. We found that anti-Mint1 polyclonal antibodies specifically precipitated a significant number of 125I-ω-GVIA binding sites (Fig.1 E). An ability of anti-Mint1 antibodies to precipitate125I-ω-GVIA binding sites was reduced by 70% in the presence of 1 mm NC peptide (Fig. 1 E), composed of putative SH3 and PDZ binding motifs in N-type Ca2+channel carboxyl termini. We concluded that at least 25% of rat brain N-type Ca2+ channels is complexed with Mint1 in vivo, presumably via carboxyl-terminal association with Mint1-1 PDZ domain. The carboxyl termini of N-type channels specifically bind Mint1-1 PDZ domain (Fig. 1). To delineate the structural determinants responsible for this interaction, we mutated the last six carboxyl-terminal amino acids in the NC4 bait and measured the strength of interaction of resulting mutants with the Mint1-1 PDZ domain in a yeast two-hybrid assay. A series of truncation, alanine substitution, and charge reversal mutants was analyzed (Fig.2 A). The obtained data set leads us to define the E/D-X-W-C/S-COOH consensus motif as the Mint1-1 recognition sequence. This sequence is different from the previously characterized class I (S/T-X-Φ-COOH) or class II (Φ-X-Φ-COOH) PDZ domains ligands (21Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar) (Φ stands for a hydrophobic residue). We propose that Mint1-1/Ca2+channels interactions define a novel class of PDZ domains (class III). Do all Ca2+ channels bind Mint1-1? To answer this question, we tested the ability of all known human N-type (12Williams M.E. Brust P.F. Feldman D.H. Patthi S. Simerson S. Maroufi A. McCue A.F. Velicelebi G. Ellis S.B. Harpold M.M.

From all the baits tested, only baits corresponding to the “long” splice variants of human N-type (NC4-DQDHWC) and Q-type (NC4-SDDDWC) interacted with Mint1-1 (Fig. 2 B). This exquisite specificity of Mint1-1 points to a potential biological relevance of Mint1-1/Ca2+channels interaction. Searches of sequence data bases reveal that the E/D-X-W-C/S-COOH motif is present exclusively in N-type and Q-type Ca2+ channel pore-forming subunits. With the exception of rabbit N-type Ca2+ channel, the E/D-X-W-C-COOH motif is evolutionary conserved in the sequence of Ca2+ channels from Drosophila melanogaster to humans (Fig. 2 C), indicating its importance for their biological function. Because of Trp → Lys substitution in the −1 position, the R-type Ca2+ channel carboxyl terminus does not bind to Mint1-1 (Fig. 2 B). The E/D-D-K/R-C-COOH motif is conserved in R-type Ca2+ channel sequence from Discopyge ommata to humans (data not shown). It is plausible that another member of class III PDZ domain family may specifically associate with this sequence. In brain Mint1 is strongly associated with CASK (5Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). CASK (6Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is another modular adaptor protein, which consists of Mint1-interacting CaM kinase domain, Veli-interacting domain (VI), β-neurexin binding PDZ domain (6Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SH3 domain, 4.1-band protein binding domain (4.1), and guanilate kinase (GK) domain (Fig.3 A). A ligand of the CASK SH3 domain has not yet been identified. We reasoned that the proline-rich region in neuronal Ca2+ channel carboxyl termini (Fig.1 A) may associate with the CASK-SH3 domain. To test this hypothesis, we performed GST-CASK-SH3 pull-down experiments with HA-tagged NC3-D2334X, NC4, NC6, and NC14 (Fig. 3 B) proteins expressed in COS cells. We found that GST-CASK-SH3 interacted strongly with NC3-D2334X and NC6, but not with NC4 and NC14 fragments (Fig.3 A), in agreement with the location of proline-rich region in the N-type channel carboxyl terminus. Similar results were obtained in pull-down experiments with full-length GST-CASK (data not shown). The NC3-D2334X fragment associated strongly with GST-CASK-SH3, but only weakly with GST-PSD95-SH3 (Fig. 3 B). A signal with a shorter NC6 fragment was observed only with GST-CASK-SH3 (Fig. 3 B) and not with GST-PSD95-SH3. Thus, we concluded that the proline-rich region of the N-type Ca2+ channel carboxyl terminus interacts strongly and specifically with the SH3 domain of CASK. Six putative SH3 domain binding motifs (P XX P) are present within this proline-rich region in N-type Ca2+ channel sequence; however we failed to assign a role of major CASK-SH3 domain binding site to any one of these motifs in further deletion mutagenesis experiments (data not shown). In additional binding experiments we also established an ability of N-type Ca2+ channel carboxyl terminus to support simultaneous in vitro interactions with Mint1 and CASK (data not shown). Neuronal Ca2+ channel carboxyl-terminal regions bind to the first PDZ domain of Mint1 (Figs. 1 and 2) and to the SH3 domain of CASK (Fig.3). In turn, Mint1 and CASK are tightly bound to each other within the tripartite presynaptic protein complex (5Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). These interactions create a potential for formation of Ca2+ channel-Mint1-CASK ternary complex and recruitment of long N-type and Q-type Ca2+channel splice variants to a macromolecular signaling complex assembled at synaptic junction (Fig. 4). By means of extracellular neurexin-neuroligin interaction (24Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Südhof T.C.

By keeping presynaptic Ca2+channels, fusion-competent synaptic vesicles, and postsynaptic receptors in alignment, the proposed complex (Fig. 4) may account for the extremely high speed and efficiency of synaptic transmission in central synapses.

https://openalex.org/W2005917147,"The early events during infection with an immunodeficiency virus were followed by application of pathogenic simian immunodeficiency virus atraumatically to the tonsils of macaques. Analyses by virologic assays and in situ hybridization revealed that the infection started locally in the tonsils, a mucosal-associated lymphoid organ, and quickly spread to other lymphoid tissues. At day 3, there were few infected cells, but then the number increased rapidly, reaching a high plateau between days 4 and 7. The infection was not detected in the dendritic cell–rich squamous epithelium to which the virus was applied; instead, it was primarily in CD4 + tonsillar T cells, close to the specialized antigen-transporting epithelium of the tonsillar crypts. Transport of the virus and immune-activating stimuli across this epithelium would allow mucosal lymphoid tissue to function in the atraumatic transmission of immunodeficiency viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2055341880,"Using a cross-linking approach, we have analyzed the function of Skp, a presumed molecular chaperone of the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli, during the biogenesis of an outer membrane protein (OmpA). Following its transmembrane translocation, OmpA interacts with Skp in close vicinity to the plasma membrane. In vitro, Skp was also found to bind strongly and specifically to pOmpA nascent chains after their release from the ribosome suggesting the ability of Skp to recognize early folding intermediates of outer membrane proteins. Pulse labeling of OmpA in spheroplasts prepared from an skp null mutant revealed a specific requirement of Skp for the release of newly translocated outer membrane proteins from the plasma membrane. Δskp mutant cells are viable and show only slight changes in the physiology of their outer membranes. In contrast, double mutants deficient both in Skp and the periplasmic protease DegP (HtrA) do not grow at 37 °C in rich medium. We show that in the absence of an active DegP, a lack of Skp leads to the accumulation of protein aggregates in the periplasm. Collectively, our data demonstrate that Skp is a molecular chaperone involved in generating and maintaining the solubility of early folding intermediates of outer membrane proteins in the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2080072228,"Prolactin (PRL) has been shown to activate the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) and the subsequent recruitment of various signaling molecules including members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription family of transcription factors. Recently, an expanding family of cytokine-inducible inhibitors of signaling has been identified that initially included four members: suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, and cytokine-inducible src homology domain 2 (SH-2) proteins. The present study analyzes the role of these members in PRL signaling. Constitutive expression of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 suppressed PRL-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 5-dependent gene transcription, and Jak2 tyrosine kinase activity was greatly reduced in the presence of SOCS-1 or SOCS-3. SOCS-1 was shown to associate with Jak2, whereas SOCS-2 was associated with the prolactin receptor. Co-transfection studies were conducted to further analyze the interactions of SOCS proteins. SOCS-2 was shown to suppress the inhibitory effect of SOCS-1 by restoring Jak2 kinase activity but did not affect the inhibitory effect of SOCS-3 on PRL signaling. Northern blot analysis revealed that SOCS-3 and SOCS-1 genes were transiently expressed in response to PRL, both in vivo and in vitro, whereas the expression of SOCS-2 and CIS genes was still elevated 24 h after hormonal stimulation. We thus propose that the early expressed SOCS genes (SOCS-1 and SOCS-3) switch off PRL signaling and that the later expressed SOCS-2 gene can restore the sensitivity of cells to PRL, partly by suppressing the SOCS-1 inhibitory effect.

Goffin V. Edery M. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 225-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). Ligand binding leads to dimerization of the receptor and activation of Jak2, which in turn phosphorylates the PRL receptor and the transcription factor STAT5. However, less is known regarding how PRL signal transduction is switched off. In addition to Jak2 and STAT5 induction, PRL receptor activation also results in the stimulation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2; however, in the case of the PRL receptor, a positive role in signal transduction has been assigned (2Ali S.

Expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 suppresses interleukin 6-induced macrophage differentiation of murine myeloid leukemia cell line M1 and interleukin 6-induced receptor phosphorylation as well as STAT activation. SOCS-1 interacts with the catalytic region of Jak kinases and suppresses their tyrosine kinase activity and, as a result, the activation of STATs.

However, the regulatory role of SOCS molecules is not limited to the cytokine receptor superfamily because SOCS-2 interacts both in vivo and in vitro with insulin-like growth factor I receptor, suggesting that SOCS proteins may play a more general role in receptor signaling (17Dey B.R.

Given the converging signaling pathways between the cytokines and PRL, we have investigated the role of the four initial members of the SOCS family (SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, and CIS) in PRL signal transduction and shown that SOCS proteins have dual effects with the ability to both inhibit and restore PRL signaling through different mechanisms. Ovine PRL was a gift from the National Hormone and Pituitary/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases program (Baltimore, MD). Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 is a product of IBI-Kodak. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (αPY) and the anti-Jak2 antibody (αJak2) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. T-47D human mammary cancer cells were grown in complete medium consisting of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were deprived of serum for a 24-h period before the addition of human PRL (1 μg/ml) for different time periods. Livers were obtained immediately after death from female 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice that had been injected intraperitoneally with ovine PRL (1 μg/g body weight) for different time periods. 293 cells were split into 6-well plates before being transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate technique with 0.5 μg of pCH110 (β-galactosidase expression vector from Pharmacia), 0.1 μg of LHRE-TK-luciferase (a fusion gene carrying six copies of the LHRE and the TK minimal promoter linked to the coding region of the luciferase gene; LHRE is a STAT5 binding element of the β-casein promoter), 0.05 μg of plasmid pRc/cmv containing PRLR cDNA, and increasing concentrations (25–250 ng DNA) of FLAG epitope-tagged SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, or CIS (also referred as CIS1) in pEF-BOS expression vector (4Starr R.

After 24 h of expression, the cells were incubated in the absence of serum before hormone stimulation (18 nm oPRL for 24 h) using serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 and then lysed, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured (18Pezet A.

Aliquots of lysates were analyzed by Western blot using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2, which confirmed that increasing the concentration of transfected SOCS plasmids resulted in increased expression of SOCS proteins. Each 100-mm culture dish of 293 cells was co-transfected with 1 μg of PRLR cDNA, 0.5 μg of cDNA encoding the human tyrosine kinase Jak2, and 4 μg of each form of SOCS-encoding plasmid. For co-expression experiments, 1 μg of SOCS-1-encoding plasmid and 10 μg of SOCS-2-encoding plasmid or 2 μg of SOCS-3-encoding plasmid and 20 μg of SOCS-2-encoding plasmid were co-transfected. Cells were stimulated by oPRL (18 nm) for 15 min. Cells were subsequently lysed as described previously, and the lysates were incubated with anti-Jak2 antibody (1 μg/ml) or anti-FLAG antibody (0.5 μg/ml) and collected using protein A-agarose or protein G-agarose (18Pezet A.

Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7%); transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (PolyscreenTM; NEN Life Science Products); and immunodetected with appropriate antibodies to anti-Jak2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:1,000), anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:10,000), anti-FLAG (Kodak; 0.5 μg/ml), and anti-PRLR (monoclonal antibody 5; 1 μg/ml); and visualized by ECF or ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The experiments were repeated four to seven times, and a representative blot is shown in the figures. The preparation of RNA from cell cultures and liver samples was carried out according to the acidic/phenol/chloroform method. Northern blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (21Martini J.-F. Pezet A. Guezennec C.Y. Edery M. Postel-Vinay M.-C. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18951-18958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using full-length cDNA inserts encoding SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, or CIS that were radiolabeled by random priming. The membranes were stripped in boiling 0.1% SDS and reprobed with the given probe. Three to four independent experiments were performed, and a representative experiment is shown in the figures. The induction of SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, and CIS gene expression in mouse liver and in T-47D mammary cells upon PRL stimulation is shown in Fig. 1.SOCS-3 and, to a lesser extent, SOCS-1 are transiently expressed in liver and mammary cells, whereas SOCS-2 and CIS have somewhat different kinetics of induction and are still elevated 24 h after hormonal stimulation. The effect of the constitutive expression of SOCS genes on the response of 293 cells to PRL was investigated using the LHRE construct, for which we obtained a maximal activation of 20.1 ± 0.8 (n= 6)-fold upon PRL stimulation when SOCS plasmids were not transfected. Luciferase activity obtained in dose-response experiments has been normalized to these maximal fold induction values and is expressed as a percentage of these values (19Goffin V. Kinet S. Ferrag F. Binart N. Martial J.A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16573-16579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The constitutive expression of the SOCS-1 gene at increasing concentrations led to inhibition of the activation of transcriptional activity starting with very low doses of transfected cDNA (25 ng/well) (Fig.2). SOCS-3 constitutive expression also led to the inability of the PRLR to transmit the transcriptional response; however, this was achieved with higher concentrations of transfected plasmid. Interestingly, expression of SOCS-2 resulted in a partial inhibition in signaling (40%; the mean was statistically different (p < 0.01, Fisher's test) from 0 μg of SOCS-2 transfected plasmid), and this was obtained only with low concentrations of transfected plasmid (25 ng/plate) (Fig. 2). Lowering the concentration of transfected SOCS-2 to 1 ng/plate did not further inhibit signaling (data not shown); higher concentrations actually resulted in a restoration of the responsiveness of the LHRE construct to PRL (Fig. 2). Constitutive expression of CIS had no effect on the activation of gene transcription by PRL. Immunoblot analysis of 293 cell lysates that were immunoprecipitated with Jak2 antibody revealed that upon constitutive expression of SOCS-1 or SOCS-3, PRL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 was greatly reduced (Fig. 3). Constitutive expression of CIS or SOCS-2 plasmid did not affect Jak2 tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 3). To further investigate the interactions of SOCS proteins in PRLR-mediated activation of gene transcription, cDNAs encoding SOCS proteins were co-transfected together with PRLR and the LHRE-TK-luciferase construct in 293 cells. As shown in Fig.4 A, the constitutive expression of SOCS-1 and SOCS-2 at increasing concentrations resulted in the restoration of activation of transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis indicates that the level of expression of SOCS-1 is not affected by SOCS-2 co-transfection (Fig. 4 B). The same experiments conducted with SOCS-3 and increasing concentrations of transfected SOCS-2 did not show any restoration of PRL signaling (Fig. 4 A), indicating that the rescue of signal transduction by SOCS-2 was specific to SOCS-1. Constitutive expression of CIS at increasing concentrations also failed to modify the effects of SOCS-1, SOCS-2, and SOCS-3 on PRL-induced transactivation of the LHRE-TK promoter (Fig.5).Figure 5Effect of constitutive co-expression of SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, and CIS on PRL-induced transactivation of the LHRE-TK promoter. 293 cells were transfected and assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In these experiments, the results of luciferase activity were assayed in cells transfected without SOCS cDNA (0:0) or with a ratio of 1:1, 1:1, and 2:1 of SOCS-1, SOCS-2, and SOCS-3, respectively, to PRLR cDNA and several ratios (1:0 to 1:10) of SOCS to CIS cDNA. Dose-response curves are expressed as a percentage of control activity (in the absence of co-transfected SOCS). 100% corresponds to a luciferase induction of 17.8-fold. Values are the means ± S.E. of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine which molecules associate with the different SOCSs in PRLR signaling, we conducted an immunoblot analysis of 293 cell lysates immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody and further analyzed them by Western blotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, as indicated in Fig. 6. Upon constitutive expression of SOCS-1, a major band of 130 kDa co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody and was identified as Jak2 by immunoblotting with an antibody to Jak2. Although SOCS-1 was shown in Fig. 3 to greatly reduce but not completely suppress tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, the apparent level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 in Fig. 6 can be attributed mainly to the use of the anti-FLAG antibody for immunoprecipitation, which co-immunoprecipitates tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak2 through its recruitment to SOCS-1. Upon constitutive expression of SOCS-2, a major band of 92 kDa was co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody. The PRLR monoclonal antibody revealed the 92-kDa protein, indicating that SOCS-2 associates with the PRLR. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the PRLR increased upon PRL stimulation because SOCS-2 did not inhibit Jak2 kinase activity. SOCS-3 constitutive expression did not reveal any major, specific tyrosine-phosphorylated protein co-immunoprecipitating with the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 6) and similarly for CIS constitutive expression; no major, specific tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown). A minor but consistent band of 130 kDa corresponding to Jak2 was observed upon SOCS-3 constitutive expression. To determine whether Jak2 kinase was involved in the restoration process, cDNAs encoding Jak2, PRLR, SOCS-1, and SOCS-2 were co-transfected. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates immunoprecipitated with Jak2 antibody revealed that upon co-expression of SOCS-1 and SOCS-2, PRL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, which had been shown to be greatly reduced by SOCS-1 alone, was restored (Fig.7). However, this was not the case when SOCS-3 and SOCS-2 were co-expressed, in which case no detectable Jak2 activity was observed with or without PRL stimulation (Fig. 7), in agreement with the absence of restoration of activation of gene transcription under these conditions. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody is shown in Fig.7 and indicates that the major tyrosine-phosphorylated band corresponds to the 92-kDa PRLR and is induced by PRL, although a minor 130-kDa band corresponding to Jak2 is present, and its tyrosine phosphorylation is induced upon PRL stimulation, which is not the case when SOCS-1 alone is transfected (Fig. 6); thus, a large proportion of the PRLR is associated with SOCS-2 during the restoration process. Also, the apparent level of expression of SOCS-1 is not affected by SOCS-2 co-transfection (Fig. 7 B) when compared with the transfection of SOCS-1 alone (Fig. 6). To investigate the individual role of each tyrosine of the cytoplasmic domain of the PRLR in SOCS-2 recruitment, cDNAs encoding the natural and mutant forms of the PRLR including 9F in which all tyrosines were replaced by phenylalanines and individual substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosines (8F-Ynnn) known to be phosphorylated (18Pezet A. Ferrag F. Kelly P.A. Edery M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25043-25050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) were co-transfected with SOCS-2-encoding plasmid. Lysates from PRL-stimulated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and further analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig.8, a major band of 92 kDa corresponding to the tyrosine-phosphorylated PRLR was co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody and was present only with wild type PRLR. None of the mutants known to be docking sites for STAT5 and highly tyrosine-phosphorylated (8F-Y580, 8F-Y479, and 8F-Y473) were associated with SOCS-2. Although it was not detectable in the anti-phosphotyrosine blot, the presence of mutant 8F-Y309 was detectable (but to a lesser extent than the wild type) using the anti-PRLR antibody; indeed, this mutant form is known to be weakly tyrosine-phosphorylated (18Pezet A. Ferrag F. Kelly P.A. Edery M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25043-25050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These results support the notion of an interaction between SOCS-2 and the PRLR and suggest that Tyr-309 may represent a docking site for SOCS-2. Understanding the mechanism by which PRL signaling is switched off requires the identification of novel proteins capable of suppressing PRL signal transduction. Recent reports have identified such proteins for several cytokines; we now assess the role of these proteins in the inhibition of PRL signal transduction pathways. Both the SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 genes were transiently expressed in mouse liver and T-47D mammary cells and shown to completely inhibit the activation of gene transcription by PRL. SOCS-1 was more potent an inhibitor at low concentrations of protein than was SOCS-3. This may correlate with the fact that lower levels of SOCS-1 mRNA than SOCS-3 are induced in hepatic cells in response to prolactin and GH (13Adams T.E. Hansen J.A. Starr R. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Billestrup N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1285-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the crucial role of SOCS-1 in postnatal growth and survival has been demonstrated recently in mice lacking SOCS-1 (22Starr R. Metcalf D. Elefanty A.G. Brysha M. Willson T.A. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14395-14399Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Interaction of SOCS-1 with Jak2 markedly reduced its tyrosine kinase activity upon PRL stimulation, supporting the observation that SOCS-1 interacts with the catalytic region of Jak kinases, thus inhibiting their catalytic activity (5Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N. Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Kanakura Y. Komiya S. Yoshimura A.

Kishimoto T. Nature. 1997; 387: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar) and, as a result, inhibiting the activation of signaling intermediates such as STATs. SOCS-2 was a partial inhibitor of signal transduction and, interestingly, when high levels of the SOCS-2 gene were constitutively expressed, there was a restoration of signaling by PRL without superinduction, as observed after GH stimulation (13Adams T.E. Hansen J.A. Starr R. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Billestrup N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1285-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Although the activity of SOCS-2 appears to differ in regulating PRL and GH signal transduction, in both cases, the enhanced response to cytokine with high levels of SOCS-2 suggests that SOCS-2 itself may regulate the activity of endogenous suppressors such as SOCS-1 or SOCS-3; indeed, co-transfection experiments using SOCS-1 and SOCS-2 indicated that SOCS-2 was able to suppress the inhibitory effect of SOCS-1 by restoring PRL signal transduction; however SOCS-2 did not suppress the inhibitory effect of SOCS-3. This is the first demonstration of a dual effect of SOCS molecules by inhibiting and restoring signaling. Although CIS gene expression was induced by PRL, the constitutive expression of this gene did not affect the activation of gene transcription by PRL. CIS has been shown to inhibit cytokine signal transduction by competing with STAT5 or other signaling molecules for docking sites on the receptor (3Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 23Matsumoto A. Masuhara M. Mitsui K. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yoshimura A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recently, CIS3, also referred to as SOCS-3, and in addition SOCS-1 but not CIS1 have been shown also to inhibit PRL receptor-mediated STAT5 signaling (16Helman D. Sandowski Y. Cohen Y. Matsumoto A. Yoshimura A. Merchav S. Gertler A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The present experiments further indicate that CIS does not modify the effects of SOCS-1, SOCS-2, and SOCS-3 on PRL signaling. Although both SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 inhibited PRL-mediated activation of gene transcription, several differences between the mechanisms of action of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 were observed: 1) SOCS-1 did associate with Jak2 and inhibited its kinase activity, whereas SOCS-3 was weakly associated with Jak2, 2) SOCS-1 was more potent than SOCS-3 in suppressing PRL signaling, and 3) SOCS-2 appeared to restore PRL signal transduction that had been inhibited by SOCS-1 but did not affect the SOCS-3 inhibitory effect. Similarly, it has been reported that SOCS-3 has a lower affinity for Jak kinases than SOCS-1, and that SOCS-3 is a weaker inhibitor of interleukin 6 signaling than SOCS-1 (15Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Yasukawa H. Masuhara M. Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Yuge K. Komiya S. Inoue A. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2271-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown recently that the inhibitions by SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 of interleukin 6 and leukemia-inhibitory factor-induced macrophage differentiation of M1 cells involve distinct portions of the Jak-STAT pathway, suggesting that the mechanisms of action of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in inhibiting signaling are quite different (12Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Farley A. Starr R. Zhang J.G. Baca M. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SOCS-2 was shown to be associated with the PRLR; as such, SOCS-2 has been shown to associate with the insulin-like growth factor I receptor, although the tyrosines involved in this interaction are not known (17Dey B.R. Spence S.L. Nissley P. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24095-24101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The interaction of SOCS-2 with the PRLR most probably involves Tyr-309 of the intracellular domain of the PRLR, which is the closest phosphorylated tyrosine to Box1 of PRLR, the region of association with Jak2 (25Pezet A. Buteau H. Kelly P.A. Edery M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 129: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The potent effect of SOCS-2 in suppressing the inhibitory effect of SOCS-1, which itself associates with Jak2, may result from the proximity of the regions of SOCS-2 and SOCS-1 association, respectively, in the PRLR and in Jak2. Given the fact that the SOCS-1 gene is expressed early as compared with the SOCS-2 gene in mammary cells and hepatic cells in response to PRL stimulation, a possible function of SOCS-2 would be to restore PRL signaling and thus re-sensitize cells to PRL after the initial inhibitory effect of SOCS-1. It will be interesting to test whether this hypothesis can be extended to other members of the expanding family of SOCS and CIS proteins and to other cytokines. The SH-2 containing tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 or SHP-2 do not appear to be involved in the inhibition of PRL signaling (2Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.J. Vogel W. Kharitonenkov A. Kelly P.A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26Berchtold S. Volarevic S. Moriggl R. Mercep M. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 556-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in contrast to signal transduction pathways activated by GH or other cytokines. The SOCS proteins appear as major regulator of PRL signaling; the complex interaction between the different SOCS molecules in PRL signaling will be further clarified by generation of mice lacking one or multiple members of this family.

https://openalex.org/W1994128601,Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is initiated by the recruitment of the clathrin adaptor protein AP-2 to the plasma membrane where the membrane protein synaptotagmin is thought to act as a docking site. AP-2 also interacts with endocytic motifs present in other cargo proteins. Peptides with a tyrosine-based endocytic motif stimulated binding of AP-2 to synaptotagmin and enhanced AP-2 recruitment to the plasma membrane of neuronal and non-neuronal cells. This suggests a mechanism by which nucleation of clathrin-coated pits is stimulated by the loading of cargo proteins.

Linolenic acid incubated at 23 °C with preparations containing the recombinant enzymes underwent α-oxidation with the formation of a chain-shortened aldehyde, i.e., 8(Z),11(Z),14(Z)-heptadecatrienal (83%), an α-hydroxy acid, 2(R)-hydroxy-9(Z),12(Z),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid (15%), and a chain-shortened fatty acid, 8(Z),11(Z),14(Z)-heptadecatrienoic acid (2%). When incubations were performed at 0 °C, 2(R)-hydroperoxy-9(Z),12(Z),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid was obtained as the main product. An intermediary role of 2(R)-hydroperoxy-9(Z),12(Z),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid in α-oxidation was demonstrated by re-incubation experiments, in which the hydroperoxide was converted into the same α-oxidation products as those formed from linolenic acid. 2(R)-Hydroperoxy-9(Z),12(Z),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid was chemically unstable and had a half-life time in buffer of about 30 min at 23 °C. Extracts of cells expressing the recombinant oxygenases accelerated breakdown of the hydroperoxide (half-life time, about 3 min at 23 °C), however, this was not attributable to the recombinant enzymes since the same rate of hydroperoxide degradation was observed in the presence of control cells not expressing the enzymes. No significant discrimination between enantiomers was observed in the degradation of 2(R, S)-hydroperoxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid in the presence of recombinant oxygenases. A previously studied system for α-oxidation in cucumber was re-examined using the newly developed techniques and was found to catalyze the same conversions as those observed with the recombinant enzymes, i.e. enzymatic α-dioxygenation of fatty acids into 2(R)-hydroperoxides and a first order, non-stereoselective degradation of hydroperoxides into α-oxidation products.

One specific hydroperoxide isomer, i.e. the 13(S)-hydroperoxide derivative of linolenic acid, is converted into jasmonic acid by a series of reactions catalyzed by allene oxide synthase, allene oxide cyclase, reductase, and β-oxidation enzymes (2Mueller M.J. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 653-663Crossref Google Scholar). This pathway is of biological importance in plants because it produces compounds which are involved in defense reactions against insects and other phytopathogens (16Farmer E.E. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7713-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), in mechanical responses such as tendril coiling (17Weiler E.W. Albrecht T. Groth B. Xia Z.-Q. Luxem M. Liss H. Andert L. Spengler P. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 591-600Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and pollen development (18McConn M. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 403-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A variety of conditions, such as mechanical perturbation, osmotic stress, attack by plant pathogens and wounding, elicit increased formation of jasmonates and other biologically active oxylipins in plant leaves (19Creelman R.A. Mullet J.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 355-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). This is partly a consequence of liberation of free linolenic acid from its esterified forms (20Conconi A. Miquel M. Browse J.A. Ryan C.A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 21Ryu S.B. Wang X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) but may also depend on increased levels of enzymes catalyzing hydroperoxide formation and metabolism. In a recent study, tobacco leaves were found to accumulate a 75-kDa protein in response to bacterial infection (22Sanz A. Moreno J.I. Castresana C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1523-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This protein, as well as a protein from Arabidopsis showing a 75% homology in amino acid sequence, were expressed in insect cells and found to cause uptake of molecular oxygen in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linolenic acid, linoleic acid, and arachidonic acid. Interestingly, the tobacco enzyme, called “pathogen-inducible oxygenase” (PIOX),1 showed significant homology to prostaglandin-endoperoxide H synthases-1 and -2 present in animal tissue (22Sanz A. Moreno J.I. Castresana C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1523-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The present study was carried out with the aim of identifying the catalytic function of the pathogen-induced oxygenase from tobacco leaves and its homologous enzyme from Arabidopsis. Evidence will be presented that both enzymes are fatty acid α-dioxygenases which catalyze conversion of linolenic acid and other fatty acids into their 2(R)-hydroperoxy derivatives. The mode of degradation of these unstable hydroperoxides into chain-shortened aldehydes and other α-oxidation products has also been studied. [1-14C]Linolenic, [1-14C]linoleic, and [9,10-3H2]oleic acids were purchased from NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Boston, MA). Dilution with unlabeled materials (Nu-Chek-Prep, Elysian, MN) followed by purification by SiO2 chromatography afforded specimens having specific radioactivities of 8.9, 3.8, and 184 kBq/μmol, respectively. In the same way, [9,10,12,13,15,16-3H6]linolenic acid (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) was diluted with unlabeled linolenic acid and purified to make a specimen having a specific radioactivity of 22.2 kBq/μmol. Seeds of Thymus vulgaris (23Smith C.R. Wolff I.A.

The O-methyloxime (MO) derivative showed two peaks on GC-MS analysis due to syn/anti isomerism. The mass spectra recorded on these peaks were virtually identical and showed prominent ions at 277 (M+, 0.5%), 262 (M+ − 15; loss of⋅CH3; 1), 246 (M+ − 31; loss of⋅OCH3; 21), 190 (7Blée E. Schuber F.

Silbert L.S. Pfeffer P.E. J. Org. Chem. 1975; 40: 3253-3258Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For preparation of the first mentioned compound, butyllithium (0.8 mmol) was added at −78 °C to an argon-purged solution of diisopropylamine (0.1 ml) in 1.5 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran. A solution of [9,10-3H2]oleic acid (111 mg; 25 MBq) and hexamethylphosphoric triamide (63 μl) in 0.25 ml of tetrahydrofuran was added and the mixture was kept under argon at 50 °C for 30 min. The material was added under a period of 30 min to 25 ml of oxygen-saturated diethyl ether at −78 °C. Oxygen gas was continuously bubbled into the reaction mixture in order to maintain oxygen saturation and to effect rapid dispersion of the introduced oleate dianion. Material obtained by extraction with diethyl ether was analyzed by RP-HPLC using solvent system IV. Three main peaks were observed, i.e. 2-hydroperoxyoleic acid (13.0 ml effluent), 2-hydroxyoleic acid (13.8 ml), and oleic acid (27.1 ml). Effluent containing 2-hydroperoxyoleic acid was collected and rapidly extracted with diethyl ether. The ether phase was dried over MgSO4and taken to dryness in vacuo. The residual 2-hydroperoxyoleic acid was dissolved in dry acetone and stored at −25 °C. Analysis of the specimen by radio-HPLC showed a radiochemical purity in excess of 95%. The specific radioactivity was 32 kBq/μmol (the drop in specific activity compared with that of the starting material was due to a slight chromatographic separation between ditritio- and unlabeled molecules in the RP-HPLC purification step resulting in partial loss of the 3H2compound). As expected, the 2-hydroperoxyoleic acid was reducible into 2-hydroxyoleic acid by treatment with SnCl2 or triphenylphosphine. Furthermore, treatment of the hydroperoxide with sodium borodeuteride afforded 2-hydroxyoleic acid with no detectable incorporation of deuterium. An aliquot of the hydroperoxide was treated with BSTFA and analyzed by GC-MS. Considerable degradation with formation of 8(Z)-heptadecenal (30%, 6.3 min retention time), the Me3Si ester of 2-ketooleic acid (9%, 10.2 min), the Me3Si ether/ester of 2-hydroxyoleic acid (18%, 10.7 min), the Me3Si ether/ester of the enol form of 2-ketooleic acid (16%, 10.9 min) took place, however, a portion of the hydroperoxide derivative (27%) chromatographed as the intact Me3Si peroxide and appeared as a peak at 11.3 min. The mass spectrum recorded on this material showed prominent ions at m/z 443 (M+ − 15; loss of⋅CH3; 1%), 426 (M+ − 32; rearrangement with loss of CH3OH; 9), 341 (M+ − 117; elimination of ⋅COOSiMe3; 6), 251 (341-90; 3), 163 (Me3Si-O-O+ = SiMe2; 13), 147 (Me3Si-O+ = SiMe2; 27), 89 (Me3SiO+; 53), and 73 (Me3Si+; 100). Recombinant oxygenases were obtained from insect cells infected with baculovirus carrying pFASTBAC (vector), pFASTBAC-tob.A5.2, or pFASTBAC-ara.N38086 (22Sanz A. Moreno J.I. Castresana C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1523-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions in 1–2 ml of sonication buffer (22Sanz A. Moreno J.I. Castresana C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1523-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) were sonicated at 0 °C by four bursts of 10 s and subsequently centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 6 min. The supernatants (protein, 1–2 mg/ml) were diluted with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7 or 7.4, and directly used for the incubations. Two crude preparations of the α-oxidation system of cucumber (27Galliard T. Matthew J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 424: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Baardseth P. Slinde E. Thomassen M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 922: 170-176Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 29Andersen Borge G.I. Slinde E. Nilsson A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were obtained in the following way. Cucumber fruits were peeled and the flesh and seed parts (175 g) were diced and added to 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7 or 7.4 (175 ml). The tissue was homogenized at 0 °C for two periods of 60 s using an Ultra-Turrax and subsequently filtered through gauze. The filtrate (protein, 0.6–0.7 mg/ml) was directly used for small scale incubations carried with various fatty acid substrates. For larger scale incubations carried out in order to prepare 2-hydroperoxy acids, the filtrate was centrifuged for 15 min at 1,100 × g. The supernatant was decanted and further centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min. The sediment fraction was either suspended in potassium phosphate buffer (140 ml; protein, 0.2–0.3 mg/ml) and used for the incubations or frozen and stored at −25 °C. The 105,000 × g particle fraction of homogenate of seeds of Vicia faba L. was prepared as described previously (6Hamberg M. Hamberg G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Suspensions of this material in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7 (protein, 0.6 mg/ml), were used as a source of peroxygenase (6Hamberg M. Hamberg G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Incubations of the tobacco and Arabidopsis oxygenases, and of whole homogenate of cucumber, were carried out with 50–250 μm fatty acid at 23 or 0 °C for the times indicated. The mixtures were diluted with 1 volume of distilled water, acidified to pH 4, and extracted twice with diethyl ether. The combined ether phases were washed with water and taken to dryness in vacuo. In most incubations, the material obtained was immediately dissolved in HPLC mobile phase, centrifuged, and analyzed by RP-radio-HPLC. For incubations with peroxygenase, suspensions (0.5 ml) of the membrane fraction from V. faba seeds were preincubated at 23 °C for 5 min with the lipoxygenase inhibitor 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (50 μm). Subsequently, [9,10-3H2]oleic acid (100 μm) and hydroperoxide (30–264 μm) were added and stirring continued for 15 min. The reaction products were extracted with diethyl ether, and the material obtained was analyzed by RP-radio-HPLC. Linolenic acid (5.9 mg; concentration, 152 μm) was stirred at 0 °C for 30 min with a suspension (140 ml) of the 48,000 × g particle fraction of homogenate of cucumber. The mixture was acidified to pH 4 and rapidly extracted with 2 volumes of diethyl ether. The material obtained following evaporation of the solvent was suspended in HPLC mobile phase (0.4 ml). After centrifugation, aliquots of 0.1 ml were subjected to RP-HPLC using solvent system I at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Effluent containing the hydroperoxide (37.0–39.4 ml) was immediately extracted with diethyl ether and the solution dried over MgSO4. Hydroperoxide obtained from several such incubations was dissolved in 0.5 ml of dry acetone (concentration, 10 mm) and stored at −25 °C. The yield of hydroperoxide from the incubated linolenic acid was 5–10% and the radiochemical purity was in excess of 95%. The identity of the hydroperoxide with 2(R)-hydroperoxy-9(Z),12(Z),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid was based on chemical and spectral analyses as described under “Results.” The rate of breakdown of 2-hydroperoxides in enzyme preparations or in buffer was determined by using one of two methods. In method A, tritium-labeled 2(R)-hydroperoxylinolenic acid (35 μm) was stirred at 23 °C with enzyme preparation or buffer (0.8 or 1 ml). At different times of stirring, the sample was directly subjected to RP-radio-HPLC using a column protected with a pre-column and a solvent system consisting of acetonitrile/water (80:20, v/v) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Remaining hydroperoxide was eluted as its salt (3.6–6.0 ml effluent), well separated from the main product of hydroperoxide breakdown, i.e. 8(Z),11(Z),14(Z)-heptadecatrienal (16.8–19.2 ml effluent). The rate of hydroperoxide breakdown was estimated by plotting the integrated radioactivity associated with the peak of unconverted hydroperoxide versus time. When 2-hydroperoxylinolenic acid was allowed to degrade in the presence of enzyme preparations, a portion of the product consisted of 2-hydroxylinolenic acid and nor-linolenic acid. These compounds are expected to elute as their salts together with the hydroperoxide, however, because of the small and variable amounts of these decomposition products (together 10% or less), no attempt was made to correct for their presence. In method B, 2(R,S)-hydroperoxyoleic acid (30 μm) was stirred with the test preparation (6 ml) at 23 °C. Aliquots of 1 ml were removed at different times and added to 5 ml of ethanol containing 25 mg of stannous chloride. After 20 min at 23 °C, an internal standard of tetracosanoic acid (70 nmol) was added and the mixtures were extracted with diethyl ether. Aliquots of the methyl-esterified product was subjected to GLC (column temperature, 270 °C) and the peak areas of methyl 2-hydroxyoleate (retention time, 3.6 min) formed by reduction of 2-hydroperoxyoleic acid remaining in the incubation mixture, and of methyl tetracosanoate (retention time, 7.8 min) due to the added internal standard were determined. The rate of hydroperoxide breakdown was calculated from plots of the ratio between the peak areas of methyl 2-hydroxyoleate and methyl tetracosanoate versus time. As with method A, no attempt was made to correct for the small amount of 2-hydroxy acid produced from the hydroperoxide during the incubation period. In some experiments, the reduced samples containing methyl 2-hydroxyoleate were derivatized with (−)-menthoxycarbonyl chloride, purified by TLC, and subjected to GC-MS operated in the selected ion monitoring mode using the ions m/z 294 and 262. By combining the peak areas of the MC derivatives of methyl 2(S)-hydroxyoleate (retention time, 13.15 min) and methyl 2(R)-hydroxyoleate (13.37 min) with the half-life data, it was possible to separately monitor breakdown of the “R” and “S” enantiomers of 2-hydroperoxyoleate. Configurational determination of 2-hydroxy acids were performed by analysis of MC derivatives by GLC or GC-MS (30Hamberg M. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 43: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). MO derivatives of carbonyl compounds and Me3Si ethers of hydroxy compounds were prepared as described previously (31Hamberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 6: 136-146Google Scholar). [2H9]Me3Si derivatives, occasionally needed to verify correct interpretation of mass spectra, were prepared by derivatization with [2H18]N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (98%, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) at 23 °C for 30 min. For analysis of 2-hydroperoxy acids by GC-MS, the hydroperoxides (10–50 μg) were derivatized with BSTFA (0.1 ml) and an aliquot of 1–2 μl containing the Me3Si peroxide/Me3Si ester was directly injected onto the column. Hydroperoxides were reduced into alcohols by treatment with SnCl2 in ethanol (5 mg/ml) at room temperature for 10 min, or with triphenyl phosphine in diethyl ether (10 mg/ml) at room temperature for 1 h. Catalytic hydrogenation was performed with platinum catalyst (3 mg) and methanol (1 ml) as the solvent. Oxidative ozonolysis was carried out as described (30Hamberg M. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 43: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) using an ozone generator model T-12 purchased from TriO3 Industries, Fort Pierce, FL. Incubations under 18O gas were conducted in an all-glass apparatus attached to a high vacuum line.18O2 (isotopic purity, 96%) was obtained from Larodan AB, Malmö, Sweden. RP-radio-HPLC was performed with columns of Nucleosil 100-5 C18 (250 × 4.6 mm) purchased from Macherey-Nagel (Düren, Germany). The solvent systems consisted of mixtures of acetonitrile, water, 2m hydrochloric acid in volume proportions 55:45:0.013 (system I), 60:40:0.013 (system II), 65:35:0.013 (system III), or 80:20:0.013 (system IV). The absorbance (210 nm) and radioactivity of HPLC effluents were determined on-line using a Spectromonitor III ultraviolet detector (Laboratory Data Control, Riviera Beach, FL) and a liquid scintillation counter (IN/US Systems, Tampa, FL), respectively. GLC was performed with a Hewlett-Packard (Avondale, PA) model 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a methylsilicone capillary column (length, 25 m; film thickness, 0.33 μm) and a flame ionization detector. Helium at a flow rate of 25 cm/s was used as the carrier gas. Retention times found on GLC were converted into C-values as described (31Hamberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 6: 136-146Google Scholar). GC-MS was carried out with a Hewlett-Packard model 5970B mass selective detector connected to a Hewlett-Packard model 5890 gas chromatograph fitted with a 5% phenylmethylsilicone capillary column (length, 12 m; film thickness, 0.33 μm). In most runs the initial column temperature was 120 °C and raised at 10 °C/min until 240 °C. Ultraviolet spectra were recorded with a Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan) model"
https://openalex.org/W1985514659,"Photodissociation of water at a wavelength of 121.6 nanometers has been investigated by using the H-atom Rydberg tagging technique. A striking even-odd intensity oscillation was observed in the OH(X) product rotational distribution. Model calculations attribute this oscillation to an unusual dynamical interference brought about by two dissociation pathways that pass through dissimilar conical intersections of potential energy surfaces, but result in the same products. The interference pattern and the OH product rotational distribution are sensitive to the positions and energies of the conical intersections, one with the atoms collinear as H-OH and the other as H-HO. An accurate simulation of the observations would provide a detailed test of global H(2)O potential energy surfaces for the three (&Xtilde;/A/&Btilde;) contributing states. The interference observed from the two conical intersection pathways provides a chemical analog of Young's well-known double-slit experiment."

A requirement of receptor endocytosis for mitogenic signal transduction therefore suggests that opiate drugs such as morphine may be profoundly deficient in mitogenic signaling activity. However, morphine is capable of causing significant activation of MAP kinase via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins (16Burt R.P. Chapple C.R. Marshall I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Polakiewicz R.D. Schieferl S.M. Dorner L.F. Kansra V. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12402-12406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, signaling via MAP kinase contributes to some mechanisms of opioid receptor desensitization, suggesting a role of mitogenic signaling in the development of physiological tolerance to opiate drugs (24Polakiewicz R.D.

Moreover, recent studies suggest an important role of MAP kinase signaling in the pathophysiology of physiological dependence and withdrawal following prolonged administration of morphine (18Schulz S. Hollt V. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1196-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus the physiological actions of addictive opiate drugs suggest a reappraisal of the relationship between receptor endocytosis and mitogenic signal transduction. We have addressed this issue using a well established model cell system in which both μ and δ opioid receptors are regulated by dynamin-dependent endocytosis (5Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 6Chu P. Murray S. Lissin D. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27124-27130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and in which the agonist selectivity of opioid receptor endocytosis closely parallels that observed in native neurons (21Keith D.E. Anton B. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Monteillet-Agius G. Stewart P.L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. Mol.

Our studies indicate that endocytosis of μ and δ opioid receptors is not required for efficient receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinase. Nevertheless, opioid receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinase measured in the same cells is strongly and specifically dynamin-dependent. These observations suggest a role of dynamin in mitogenic signal transduction mediated by certain G protein-coupled receptors that is distinct from its role in mediating endocytosis of the receptor itself. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown on coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (University of California, San Francisco, cell culture facility). Stably transfected cells expressing μ opioid receptors were generated by calcium phosphate precipitation and selected with 100 μg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) For staining, cells were incubated for 30 min in medium containing 3.5 μg/ml M1 anti-FLAG antibody (Kodak IBI), then treated with 5 μm agonist for 30 min, and fixed using 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in 3% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline + 1 mm CaCl2, then incubated with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody for 30 min (1:500, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.). Conventional fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon 60X NA1.4 objective. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum then starved without serum for 18 h. Cells were then cultured for 2 h in fresh serum free medium, then exposed to new serum free medium containing agonist for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in SDS sample buffer. Samples were passed through a 22-gauge needle to reduce sample viscosity, heated to 100 °C for 5 min, cooled on ice, then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by immunoblotting according to the manufacturer's instructions (NEB, Inc. Beverly MA). Ligand-dependent activation of MAP kinase was assayed in stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing murine μ opioid receptors using an antibody that specifically recognizes the activated form of p42/44 MAP kinase (Erk1 and Erk2). We compared the effects of opioid peptide (d-Ala2, N-methyl-Phe4, Gly-ol5]enkephalin, a hydrolysis-resistant analog of enkephalin) to those of the alkaloid analgesic drugs morphine and etorphine. Both of these drugs activate opioid receptors to signal via heterotrimeric G proteins, but differ dramatically in their effects on dynamin-dependent endocytosis of receptors (5Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 6Chu P. Murray S. Lissin D. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Morphine caused no detectable endocytosis of receptors, whereas etorphine promoted dynamin-dependent endocytosis of receptors to a similar extent as opioid peptide (Fig.1 A). Surprisingly, despite their dramatically different effects on receptor endocytosis, each of these agonists strongly induced receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinase (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore MAP kinase activation induced by all these agonists occurred with similar kinetics (not shown), causing peak activation at 5 min after addition to the culture medium. Quantitation of MAP kinase activation at this time point indicated that all of these ligands (when examined at saturating concentrations to avoid confounding effects of differences in agonist potency) (15Raynor K. Kong H. Chen Y. Yasuda K., Yu, L. Bell G.I. Reisine T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 330-334PubMed Google Scholar, 25Raynor K. Kong H. Law S. Heerding J. Tallent M. Livingston F. Hines J. Reisine T. Natl. Inst. Drug Abuse Res. Monogr. 1996; 161: 83-103Google Scholar) were similarly efficacious for inducing receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinase (Fig. 1 C). We next asked whether the ability of morphine to activate MAP kinase without inducing endocytosis of receptors was unique to this agonist, or whether this property may be more general to other analgesic drugs. Furthermore, as many analgesic drugs activate more than one type of opioid receptor when administered at clinically relevant concentrations, we also asked whether other opioid receptors were capable of mediating endocytosis-independent activation of MAP kinase. To accomplish this, we examined a chimeric mutant δ/κ opioid receptor that is completely defective in endocytosis, even when activated by saturating concentrations of etorphine (6Chu P. Murray S. Lissin D. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27124-27130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Despite its failure to endocytose upon activation by agonist, this mutant opioid receptor mediated etorphine-induced activation of MAP kinase to an equal or greater extent than did the wild-type δ opioid receptor (Fig. 2). Thus the ability of opiate drugs to induce endocytosis-independent activation of MAP kinase is not unique to morphine or the μ opioid receptor. As an alternative test of a potential role of opioid receptor endocytosis in mitogenic signaling, we examined whether experimentally inducing dynamin-dependent endocytosis of morphine-activated opioid receptors was sufficient to enhance drug-induced activation of MAP kinase. To accomplish this, we examined receptor-mediated MAP kinase activation in cells overexpressing β-arrestin at high levels, in which morphine promotes rapid, dynamin-dependent endocytosis of opioid receptors (5Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Despite the profoundly different effects of morphine on opioid receptor endocytosis observed in this variant cell line compared with cells expressing receptors at similar level but not overexpressing β-arrestin, no enhancement of morphine-induced activation of MAP kinase was observed (Fig. 3, compare lanes 4 and 7). Furthermore the amount of MAP kinase activation induced by morphine was closely similar to that induced by opioid peptide in both cell lines (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 6 and 7), even though morphine-induced endocytosis of opioid receptors is selectively enhanced by >40-fold in the cells overexpressing arrestin (5Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Taken together, these experiments indicate that dynamin-dependent endocytosis of opioid receptors is neither necessary nor sufficient for receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinase. Despite the ability of opiate drugs to strongly induce endocytosis-independent activation of MAP kinase, previous studies support an essential role of dynamin-dependent endocytosis of other G protein-coupled receptors in MAP kinase signaling. Furthermore, recent studies indicate that MAP kinase activation induced by opioid peptides is also strongly dynamin-dependent (26Ignatova E.G. Belcheva M.M. Bohn L.M. Neuman M.C. Coscia C.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 56-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus we examined whether opioid receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinase induced by opiate drugs also required functional dynamin. To accomplish this, opioid-induced activation of MAP kinase was assayed in cells overexpressing K44E mutant dynamin I, which specifically inhibits endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits in a dominant-negative manner (1Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar,2Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, these experiments clearly indicated that receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinase induced by opiate drugs was also strongly and specifically dynamin-dependent. Receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinase induced by both etorphine and morphine was completely blocked by K44E mutant dynamin (Fig.4) even though morphine failed to induce any detectable endocytosis of receptors over the time course of MAP kinase activation. Overexpressing wild-type dynamin I at similar levels did not block opioid receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinase by either agonist (Fig. 4), confirming the biochemical specificity of the inhibition observed. We conclude that endocytosis is not required for efficient ligand-induced activation of MAP kinase by μ and δ opioid receptors, even though receptor-mediated signaling via this effector cascade is specifically dynamin-dependent. These studies establish the first example of MAP kinase activation by a G protein-coupled receptor that is dynamin-dependent but does not require endocytosis of the receptor protein. Thus these studies suggest an additional function of dynamin in mitogenic signal transduction that is distinct from its essential role in mediating endocytosis of the receptor itself. Further studies will be required to elucidate the precise role of dynamin in mitogenic signal transduction. One possibility is that dynamin-dependent endocytosis of another protein, distinct from the opioid receptor itself, is required for receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinase. Another possibility is that dynamin may mediate a distinct biochemical function in signal transduction in addition to its essential role in endocytic membrane fission (27Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 28Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 29Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). In support of this latter hypothesis, we note that dynamin is a regulated GTPase that is capable of interacting with a wide variety of cytoplasmic and membrane-associated proteins. Although some of these interacting proteins are associated specifically with clathrin-coated pits, others (such as amphiphysin, Grb2, phospholipase Cγ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Src) are thought to mediate distinct or additional functions independent of, or in addition to, the membrane fission machinery itself (for review see Ref. 30Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Moreover, a significant pool of cellular dynamin isoforms is associated with microdomains of the plasma membrane that are not engaged in endocytosis (2Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Finally, although the traditionally accepted role of dynamin is as a mechanochemical GTPase that itself mediates endocytic membrane fission (31Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 32Takei K. Haucke V. Slepnev V. Farsad K. Salazar M. Chen H. De Camilli P. Cell. 1998; 94: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), recent studies suggest that dynamin can function as a GTP-dependent molecular switch to regulate the membrane fission machinery in a manner analogous to the regulation of a downstream effector by a “classical” signaling GTPase (33Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Whereas previous studies provide strong evidence for significant heterogeneity in mechanisms of mitogenic signal transduction by individual G protein-coupled receptors in various cell types, the present results provide the first direct evidence for distinct functional roles of dynamin in G protein-coupled receptor-mediated endocytosis and signal transduction. These observations are specifically relevant to the physiological actions of opiate drugs such as morphine on the μ opioid receptor. However, it is clear from our studies that these observations are not unique to morphine nor to the μ opioid receptor. Moreover, as opioid receptors activate MAP kinase by a molecular mechanism similar to that of other Gi-coupled receptors (and distinct from an alternative protein kinase C-mediated mechanism activated by Gq-coupled receptors) (13Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), we anticipate that this dissociation between the signaling and endocytic activities of dynamin may be of general importance to certain other G protein-coupled receptors that activate MAP kinase in a dynamin-dependent manner.

https://openalex.org/W1963970071,"We have investigated the interactions with isolated mitochondria and intact cells of chloromethyltetramethylrosamine (CMTMRos), a probe (Mitotracker OrangeTM) that is increasingly used to monitor the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) in situ. CMTMRos binds to isolated mitochondria and undergoes a large fluorescence quenching. Most of the binding is energy-independent and can be substantially reduced by sulfhydryl reagents. A smaller fraction of the probe is able to redistribute across the inner membrane in response to a membrane potential, with further fluorescence quenching. Within minutes, however, this energy-dependent fluorescence quenching spontaneously reverts to the same level obtained by treating mitochondria with the uncoupler carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone. We show that this event depends on inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain at complex I and on induction of the permeability transition pore by CMTMRos, with concomitant depolarization, swelling, and release of cytochrome c. After staining cells with CMTMRos, depolarization of mitochondria in situ with protonophores is accompanied by changes of CMTMRos fluorescence that range between small and undetectable, depending on the probe concentration. A lasting decrease of cellular CMTMRos fluorescence associated with mitochondria only results from treatment with thiol reagents, suggesting that CMTMRos binding to mitochondria in living cells largely occurs at SH groups via the probe chloromethyl moiety irrespective of the magnitude of Δψm. Induction of the permeability transition precludes the use of CMTMRos as a reliable probe of Δψm in situ and demands a reassessment of the conclusion that cytochrome c release can occur without membrane depolarization and/or onset of the permeability transition.

In the presence of μm dATP or mm ATP, cytochrome c is able to activate procaspase 9, followed by activation of procaspase 3 (1Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.

Cloning has recently revealed that apoptosis-inducing factor is a flavoprotein with predicted mass of 57 kDa that displays a striking homology with bacterial ferredoxin and NADH oxidoreductases (4Susin S.A.

Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). Activation of the apoptotic program by these mitochondrial proteins requires their release into the cytosol, and the mechanism(s) by which this occurs is the subject of intense investigation (see Refs. 5Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cai J. Yang J. Jones D.P. Biochim. Biophys.

One of the most studied targets is the mitochondrial PT,1 a sudden increase of the inner membrane permeability to solutes that has been extensively studied for at least 40 years (see Refs. 8Bernardi P.

It is generally agreed that the PT is due to opening of a high conductance channel, MTP, which is activated by matrix Ca2+ and inhibited by CsA. The MTP possesses regulatory sites that accommodate many mediators of cell death, and its opening in vitro is accompanied by depolarization and matrix swelling. A specific question is whether or not a mitochondrial PT is a requisite for the release of apoptogenic proteins, an issue that has generated conflicting results (2Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N.

Mitochondrial membrane potential difference (Δψm) in single cells is routinely measured using cationic fluorescent probes in conjunction with microscopy techniques. One of the properties of the ideal probe is minimal or absent passive binding to mitochondrial or other intracellular membranes, which allows its rapid response to changes of Δψm (see Ref. 20Rottenberg H. Wu S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar for a thorough discussion). However, studies of mitochondrial involvement in cell death often demand the assessment of a series of parameters that may require cell fixation, including assessment of cytochrome c release with in situ methods based on immunodetection. This is obviously not compatible with the maintenance of Δψm, because fixation leads to immediate depolarization with release of the Δψm probes previously accumulated by energized mitochondria. To circumvent this problem, Kroemer and co-workers (21Macho A. Decaudin D. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Cytometry. 1996; 25: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) introduced the use of chloromethyl derivatives of the fluorescent cationic rosamine probes (MitotrackerTM). The rationale is that the positively charged probe will be accumulated by energized mitochondria in response to Δψm, followed by binding to mitochondrial SH groups via the probe chloromethyl moiety. At this point, the covalently bound probe should not be released despite de-energization and therefore stably “mark” the membrane potential existing prior to disruption of membrane integrity. Macho et al. (21Macho A. Decaudin D. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Cytometry. 1996; 25: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) indeed showed that accumulation of one of the Mitotracker dyes by thymocytes is somewhat reduced by the uncoupler FCCP. This study represented the basis for the widespread use of Mitotrackers (including those that have never been tested in mitochondria like CMTMRos) as probes of Δψm in the course of apoptosis (16Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Because no reports were available on the interactions of CMTMRos with isolated mitochondria, we have carried out a detailed characterization of its effects on basic mitochondrial functions. We show that CMTMRos inhibits the mitochondrial respiratory chain at complex I and that it induces opening of the MTP with concomitant depolarization, swelling, and release of cytochrome c. Depolarization of mitochondria in situ with protonophores is accompanied by small or negligible changes of CMTMRos fluorescence, depending on the probe concentration, whereas large and lasting fluorescence changes only result from treatment with specific thiol reagents that also decrease probe binding to isolated mitochondria. These results demonstrate that CMTMRos is not a reliable Δψm probe and demand a reassessment of the evidence that cytochrome c release can occur without membrane depolarization and/or onset of the PT, which has largely been based on the lack of CMTMRos fluorescence changes in the course of apoptosis (15Li H.

In the experiments of Fig. 1 C, mitochondria (25 mg × ml−1) in 0.2 m sucrose, 10 mmTris-MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA-Tris were treated with 400 pmol × mg protein−1 FCCP. Identical aliquots were then supplemented with 1 μmol × mg protein−1 NEM, 100 nmol × mg protein−1 PhAsO, or 1 μmol × mg protein−1 NEM plus 100 nmol × mg protein−1 PhAsO, and incubations were continued for 1 h on ice. The emission spectra of CMTMRos (see Fig. 1 D) were collected at λexc = 505 nm, with excitation and emission slits set at 2.5 nm. Other measurements of CMTMRos fluorescence were performed at λexc = 525 nm and λem = 576 nm with excitation and emission slits of 2 and 5 nm, respectively. Mitochondrial membrane potential was estimated on the Nernst equilibration of rhodamine 123, assuming a matrix volume of 1 μl × mg protein−1. Mitochondrial rhodamine 123 uptake was determined under the specified conditions from the fluorescence changes of mitochondrial suspensions containing 0.7 μm rhodamine 123. Because of the presence of CMTMRos during these measurements, variations of rhodamine 123 fluorescence were monitored at the wavelength pair 465–525, with slits set at 2 and 5 nm, respectively. These conditions allowed minimization of the spectral interference between the two probes but could not completely prevent a fluorescence decrease upon the addition of CMTMRos. This abrupt fluorescence change, which was Δψm-independent and occurred also in fully de-energized mitochondria, was subtracted in the Δψmcalculations shown in Fig. 4. MH1C1 rat hepatoma cells were seeded onto uncoated 22-mm-diameter round glass coverslips and grown for 2 days in Ham's F-10 nutrient mixture supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a Forma tissue culture water-jacketed incubator. MH1C1 cells grown on each coverslip were then loaded for 45 min at 37 °C with the indicated concentration of the specified probe dissolved in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma D6650) without penicillin and maintained in the same medium after loading. Cell fluorescence images were acquired with an Olympus IMT-2 inverted microscope, which was equipped for epifluorescent illumination and included a xenon light source (75 W), a 12-bit digital cooled CCD camera (Micromax, Princeton Instruments), and excitation-emission wavelength filter settings at bandpass 545 ± 25 nm to 590 nm longpass. Images were collected with exposure times ranging between 80 and 100 ms using a 40×, 1.3 NA oil immersion objective (Nikon). Data were acquired and analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). Clusters of several mitochondria (10–30 mitochondria) were identified as regions of interest, whereas nuclear regions were identified as cellular areas without appreciable mitochondrial fluorescence. Background was taken from fields not containing cells. Sequential digital images were acquired every 30 s for 10–20 min, and the average fluorescence intensity of all the regions of interest, of the nuclear regions, and of the background was recorded and stored for subsequent analysis. Mitochondrial fluorescence intensities minus background are reported in Fig. 5 after normalization of the initial fluorescence for comparative purposes, and they represent the mean of 10 regions of interest from three different sets of cells. CMTMRos and rhodamine 123 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and dissolved in Me2SO. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest available grade. Cyclosporin A was a generous gift from Novartis (Basel, CH). CMTMRos is a probe that stains mitochondria in situ. Because it carries a net positive charge, it can be accumulated by energized mitochondria, which indeed are brightly colored by CMTMRos in living cells in culture (see Fig. 5). Through its chloromethyl moiety, on the other hand, CMTMRos can form covalent bonds with SH groups in proteins, which is the basis for its being “fixable.” Because a reliable probe must be able to redistribute depending on Δψm, we studied the interactions of CMTMRos with isolated mitochondria under different metabolic conditions. The experiments of Fig. 1 report the kinetics of CMTMRos fluorescence quenching following addition of mitochondria and of different respiratory substrates (preliminary experiments indicated that fluorescence quenching is not accompanied by shifts in the emission spectrum of CMTMRos; results not shown). In the absence of rotenone, the addition of mitochondria caused extensive fluorescence quenching that could only be marginally enhanced by addition of the respiratory substrates glutamate and malate (Fig.1 A). Shortly after the addition of mitochondria, however, the fluorescence signal increased spontaneously to a level that could only be marginally modified by FCCP (this sequence of events was also observed in the absence of added substrates; results not shown). Addition of mitochondria in the presence of rotenone was followed by a smaller fluorescence quenching, which was enhanced by energization with succinate (Fig. 1 B). Also in this case, after a few minutes the fluorescence signal spontaneously returned to the level preceding the addition of substrate and could not be further modified by FCCP. This same level of fluorescence was obtained upon the addition of mitochondria treated with FCCP (Fig. 1 C, trace a) or by adding FCCP prior to the spontaneous fluorescence increase (Fig.1, dashed traces in A and B). Finally, the CMTMRos fluorescence quenching observed upon the addition of mitochondria in the presence of FCCP (Fig. 1 C, trace a) could be reduced by pretreatment with NEM (Fig. 1C, trace b) or with the hydrophobic dithiol reagent PhAsO (Fig. 1C, trace c), no additive effects being observed with the two compounds together (Fig. 1 C, trace d). To study the relationship between fluorescence quenching and binding of CMTMRos to mitochondria, we incubated a solution of 2 μmCMTMRos with mitochondria that had been (i) de-energized with rotenone, (ii) energized with succinate, or (iii) energized with succinate, followed by de-energization with FCCP (i.e. conditions like those illustrated in Fig. 1 B for the fluorescence-quenching experiments). Mitochondria were then separated by centrifugation, and the residual fluorescence of the supernatants was measured and compared with that of CMTMRos prior to the addition of mitochondria. Fig.1 D shows that rotenone-treated mitochondria bound a large fraction of CMTMRos (trace b, compare with trace a), that energization with succinate caused further CMTMRos binding (trace c, compare with trace b), and that treatment with FCCP released only the dye that had been accumulated upon energization (trace d, compare with trace c). These experiments indicate that CMTMRos fluorescence quenching by mitochondria is due to binding of the probe and that two components can be clearly identified: (i) one component is energy-independent, in that it is also observed in de-energized mitochondria (treatment with rotenone prior to the addition of succinate, Fig. 1 B; pretreatment with FCCP, Fig. 1C); this component largely (but not exclusively) results from binding to SH groups, in that it can be significantly prevented by NEM and PhAsO (Fig. 1C); (ii) one component is energy-dependent, in that it is observed only in mitochondria energized with endogenous substrates or with added glutamate plus malate (Fig. 1 A) or with succinate (Fig.1 B); this component of CMTMRos quenching is readily reversed by de-energization with FCCP (dashed traces in Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that it is measuring Δψm. The major problem identified in these experiments is that within minutes of the energy-dependent accumulation of CMTMRos mitochondria undergo spontaneous release of the probe, suggesting that they have depolarized. In principle, mitochondrial depolarization can be caused by inhibition of respiration, increased membrane permeability to protons (or charged species in general), or both. One of the most studied endogenous targets for permeability changes is the MTP, an inner membrane high conductance channel whose opening leads to collapse of the Δψm and to solute equilibration within the limits of the channel's exclusion size of approximately 1,500 Da (see Ref. 11Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholarfor a recent review). MTP opening can be conveniently studied based on the apparent absorbance change of mitochondria, which decreases when the pore opens and mitochondria swell (11Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). The experiments of Fig.2 document the volume changes following the addition of CMTMRos to mitochondria energized with either glutamate plus malate (Fig. 2 A) or succinate in the presence of rotenone (Fig. 2 B). Following the accumulation of a small Ca2+ load that did not cause MTP opening per se, EGTA was added to prevent Ca2+ release via the uniporter (23Igbavboa U. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1405-1412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by increasing concentrations of CMTMRos. CMTMRos caused a decrease of absorbance (Fig. 2, A and B, traces a–d) that was fully prevented by CsA (Fig. 2, A and B, traces e) and therefore mediated by MTP opening. CMTMRos was a more effective inducer with glutamate and malate (Fig. 2 A and closed symbols in Fig. 2 C) than with succinate as the substrate (Fig.2 B and open symbols in Fig. 2 C), suggesting specific interactions with respiratory complex I, which is a well characterized element of MTP modulation (24Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 25Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It is important to note that CMTMRos caused a PT at submicromolar concentrations, i.e. well within the range that is used in cellular studies. We next assessed the effects of CMTMRos on mitochondrial electron transfer by measuring the rate of uncoupled (maximal) respiration at increasing CMTMRos concentrations. Depolarization favors opening of the MTP (26Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8834-8839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which causes (i) depletion of pyridine nucleotides (with secondary inhibition of electron transfer from NAD+-dependent substrates to complex I) and (ii) swelling with gradual cytochrome c depletion (with secondary inhibition of electron transfer between the bc1 and aa3 cytochromes). These measurements, illustrated in Fig.3, were therefore performed both in the presence (open symbols) and absence (closed symbols) of CsA, to sort out the primary effects of CMTMRos on electron transfer from the secondary effects mediated by events caused by MTP opening. CMTMRos inhibited electron transfer at complex I (Fig.3 A, open symbols), and respiratory inhibition was dramatically potentiated by omission of CsA (Fig. 3 A, closed symbols). On the other hand, respiration through complexes II + III was much less affected by CMTMRos (Fig.3 B, open symbols), inhibition of respiration being observed only at 5 μm CMTMRos (Fig. 3 B, open symbols), whereas the early inhibition observed in the absence of CsA (Fig. 3 B, closed symbols) was due to MTP-dependent loss of cytochrome c and could be prevented by 10 μm added cytochrome c (results not shown). These effects of CMTMRos (inhibition of complex I and, at higher concentrations, of complexes II and III; induction of MTP opening) can easily explain the spontaneous increase of CMTMRos fluorescence observed in Fig. 1 as being due to CMTMRos-dependent mitochondrial depolarization. This issue was addressed directly in protocols where Δψm was measured with rhodamine 123 (a probe that displayed a tolerable overlap with the CMTMRos spectrum). Fig.4 shows that in the absence of CsA submicromolar concentrations of CMTMRos caused a dramatic depolarization of mitochondria irrespective of whether complex I or complex II electron donors were used (Fig. 4, A and B, closed symbols), although depolarization was more effective in the former case. In the presence of CsA, depolarization was still observed with submicromolar concentrations of CMTMRos with glutamate plus malate as the substrates, whereas higher concentrations were needed with succinate. These experiments confirm that CMTMRos dramatically impairs maintenance of the Δψm through effects that can be explained by a combination of respiratory inhibition and MTP opening. CMTMRos is being increasingly used to monitor Δψm in living cells (15Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar,16Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 932-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The problems posed by cellular measurements are different from those encountered in studies with isolated mitochondria. In studies with isolated mitochondria very high intramitochondrial concentrations are reached, which in turn result in extensive self-quenching of the dye fluorescence (Fig. 1). In principle, this can be exploited to estimate Δψm, whose magnitude is indeed related to quenching of the total suspension fluorescence. Conversely, when mitochondria are studied with the same probe in cytofluorimetric or imaging protocols, the magnitude of Δψm is estimated from the intensity of the cell fluorescence. We have therefore studied the interactions of CMTMRos with living cells and assessed its response to depolarization and sulfhydryl reagents in imaging protocols where conditions were optimized for staining of mitochondria in situ. In the experiments of Fig. 5, fluorescence changes were studied in cultures of MH1C1 cells grown on coverslips and loaded with CMTMRos concentrations ranging between 25 and 150 nm or with 25 nm TMRM, a widely used Δψm probe (28Loew L.M. Tuft R.A. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2396-2407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In all cases the fluorescence displayed a punctate pattern typical of a mitochondrial distribution, which was stable with time. The addition of FCCP was followed by fluorescence changes that critically depended on the CMTMRos concentration. A small and stable fluorescence decrease was observed at 25 nmCMTMRos (Fig. 5, A, A′, and trace a), while essentially no change was detected at 75 nm (Fig. 5, B, B′, and trace b) and 150 nm CMTMRos (Fig. 5, C, C′, and trace c). Even under the most favorable conditions (25 nm CMTMRos), the fluorescence response to FCCP was a minimal fraction of that displayed by TMRM (Fig. 5, D, D′, and trace d). The interaction of CMTMRos with mitochondria in intact cells was addressed further in the experiments of Fig.6. MH1C1 cells were incubated with 150 nm CMTMRos (Fig. 6 A). As expected, the punctate pattern of cellular fluorescence was not affected by pretreatment with FCCP (Fig. 6 B), whereas pretreatment with NEM (Fig.6 C) or PhAsO (Fig. 6 D) significantly changed the staining pattern. In both cases the cytoplasmic staining became diffuse, and nuclei became fluorescent with brigth nucleolar-type staining, an effect that was particularly prominent in the case of NEM (Fig. 6 C). These results indicate that mitochondrially associated CMTMRos fluorescence displays a prevalent energy-independent component in intact cells as well and that mitochondrial binding largely occurs at SH groups. In this paper we have shown that CMTMRos is a powerful inducer of the mitochondrial PT and a respiratory inhibitor that is particularly efficient with respiratory complex I. Once MTP opening has occurred, further respiratory inhibition takes place because of depletion of pyridine nucleotides and of cytochrome c. As a result of these effects, CMTMRos causes mitochondrial depolarization; yet most of the probe cannot be released because it binds in an energy-independent way. Rather than reporting changes of Δψm, variations of CMTMRos fluorescence are more likely to reflect modification of mitochondrial and cellular SH groups. The major conclusion of the present study is therefore that CMTMRos cannot be used as a reliable Δψm probe in living cells, a consideration that has profound implications for the current debate on the role of mitochondria in cell death and in particular on the mechanism of cytochrome c release in apoptosis. Indeed, a PT caused by CMTMRos could have contributed to cause cytochrome c release in situ, and the ensuing depolarization may simply not have been detected (15Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar, 16Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) by the lack of fluorescence changes of the probe. It must also be stressed that CMTMRos still stains mitochondria in cells that have been treated with fully uncoupling concentrations of FCCP (Fig.6 B). Our results invalidate conclusions about the time sequence of events between mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c release that are based on the use of CMTMRos irrespective of whether the probe is added before or after the apoptotic stimulus."

Experiments involving the microinjection of antibodies specific for the p110 catalytic subunit of class I PI3-kinases demonstrated an absolute requirement for this form of the enzyme in GLUT4 translocation. This finding was confirmed by the demonstration that the PI3-kinase antagonist wortmannin inhibits GLUT4 and insulin-responsive aminopeptidase translocation with a dose response identical to that required to inhibit another class I PI3-kinase-dependent event, activation of pp70 S6-kinase. Interestingly, wortmannin inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake at much lower doses, suggesting the existence of a second, higher affinity target of the drug. Subsequent removal of wortmannin from the media shifted this dose-response curve to one resembling that for GLUT4 translocation and pp70 S6-kinase. This is consistent with the lower affinity target being p110, which is irreversibly inhibited by wortmannin. Wortmannin did not reduce glucose uptake in cells stably expressing Myr-Akt, which constitutively induced GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane; this demonstrates that wortmannin does not inhibit the transporters directly. In addition to elucidating a second wortmannin-sensitive pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, these studies suggest that the presence of GLUT4 on the plasma membrane is not sufficient for activation of glucose uptake.

Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is mediated primarily by the rapid movement of the fat/muscle-specific glucose transporter GLUT41 from a latent intracellular compartment to the cell surface (1Birnbaum M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). An insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP) also resides in this compartment, and this protein also translocates to the plasma membrane after insulin stimulation (2Keller S.R. Scott H.M. Mastick C.C.

A. 1994; 91: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Insulin-responsive tissues also express GLUT1, a ubiquitous glucose transporter largely responsible for basal uptake (1Birnbaum M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Whereas GLUT4 and IRAP reside predominantly in an intracellular compartment in the basal state and are largely excluded from the plasma membrane, GLUT1 localizes significantly to the plasma membrane in addition to the cell interior. Glucose uptake can be regulated by several distinct mechanisms. Acute insulin treatment stimulates the translocation of both GLUT4 and GLUT1 to the cell surface, thus significantly increasing the permeability of the membrane for glucose. Chronic exposure to insulin increases glucose uptake predominantly by up-regulating GLUT1 gene expression through a transcriptional mechanism (4Tordjman K.M. Leingang K.A. James D.E. Mueckler M.M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 9885-9890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, several lines of evidence suggest that the catalytic activity of GLUT4 and GLUT1 on the plasma membrane may be regulated (6Czech M.P. Clancy B.M. Pessino A. Woon C.-W. Harrison S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 197-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Recently, much attention has focused on elucidating the signal transduction pathways that regulate insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation (7Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocrine Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A great deal is now known regarding signaling events that occur at the level of the receptor. Insulin binding to and activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase results in the rapid phosphorylation of downstream substrates, such as the insulin receptor substrates, which recruit signaling molecules containing SH2 domains into an active signaling complex. Engagement of these SH2 domain-containing proteins with the tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs on IRS-1 activates many of these molecules, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), the tyrosine-specific phosphatase SHPTP2, and Grb2/SOS-mediated loading of GTP onto p21ras. Most of these do not mediate insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (8Hausdorff S.F. Frangioni J.V. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol.

This conclusion derives from two lines of evidence as follows: inhibition of glucose transport by drugs such as wortmannin and LY294002, which inhibit some PI3-kinases (13Sanchez-Margalet V. Goldfine I.D. Vlahos C.J. Sung C.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Okada T. Kawano Y. Sabakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar); and antagonism of the response by truncation mutants of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase, which block association and activation of the p110α and -β catalytic subunits. However, each protocol suffers significant drawbacks. Questions persist concerning the specificity of inhibitors, and it is already well established that wortmannin inhibits a number of PI3-kinase isoforms with nanomolar efficiency. Similarly, it is difficult to be certain concerning the in vivo specificity of p85 SH2 domain interactions, particularly at the high concentrations achieved by somatic cell microinjection. Thus, we decided to address this problem by two independent strategies as follows: a careful analysis of the effects of a range of concentrations of wortmannin on insulin-stimulated glucose transport, and the utilization of a PI3-kinase isoform-specific neutralizing antisera.A growing family of PI3-kinase proteins has been identified. Class I PI3-kinases are heterodimers containing an adaptor/regulatory subunit and a tightly associated catalytic subunit. Class IA proteins specifically contain an 85-kDa regulatory subunit, which is activated by tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, such as IRS-1, upon binding of its SH2 domains to tyrosine-phosphorylated Y XX M motifs, and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (16Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Class IB regulatory subunits are unrelated to those in class IA but interact with a largely homologous, although distinct, set of catalytic subunits (16Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Class II and III PI3-kinases are also widely expressed (16Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), and many isoforms retain sensitivity to wortmannin (16Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 17Domin J. Pages F. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Class III PI3-kinases utilize only PI as a substrate.Class IA PI3-kinase is thought to mediate insulin's stimulation of GLUT4 translocation, based largely on its recruitment by IRS proteins. As noted above, experiments expressing dominant negative forms of p85 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes support this hypothesis; microinjection of either dominant negative mutants of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase or a GST-p85 fusion protein into 3T3-L1 adipocytes blocks GLUT4 translocation (18Kotani K. Carozzi A.J. Sakaue H. Hara K. Robinson L.J. Clark S.F. Yonezawa K. James D.E. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19Haruta T.

However, recent studies indicate that IRS-associated PI3-kinase activity may not be required for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, and an alternative PI3-kinase-dependent pathway has been proposed (21Sharma P.M.

Therefore, the role of class IA PI3-kinases in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation requires further verification.The studies described below summarize data accumulated using wortmannin to identify which PI3-kinases regulate its inhibition of insulin-mediated events. At least two different wortmannin targets were identified that regulate its inhibition of glucose uptake; the p110 catalytic subunit of class 1A PI3-kinases was found to be a lower affinity target regulating GLUT4 translocation, and a second, higher affinity target was found which is important for the inhibition of cell-surface glucose transport activity by wortmannin. In addition to demonstrating a role for p110 in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, these data describe the dissociation of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation, suggesting the requirement for insulin-induced activation of glucose transporters.RESULTSWortmannin inhibits insulin-stimulated hexose uptake and GLUT4 and IRAP translocation in multiple tissues (14Okada T.

Interestingly, we observed that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, wortmannin inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 and IRAP translocation with distinct dose responses. These cells were treated with increasing concentrations of wortmannin for 30 min, followed by stimulation with 100 nm insulin for 15 min; the uptake of 2-deoxyglucose and the translocation of GLUT4 and IRAP were then measured in parallel. Whereas wortmannin inhibited glucose uptake and GLUT4 and IRAP translocation, their sensitivities to wortmannin were markedly different (Fig. 1 A). The half-maximal dose for inhibition of 2-deoxyglucose uptake was approximately 6 nm wortmannin, whereas that for inhibition of GLUT4/IRAP translocation was approximately 80 nm (Fig.1, A and B). The most striking disparity was at 10 nm wortmannin, where 2-deoxyglucose uptake was inhibited ∼77%, and a full complement of GLUT4 and IRAP was detectable on the cell surface. Similarly, at 30 nm wortmannin, 2-deoxyglucose uptake was reduced to basal levels, and GLUT4/IRAP translocation was inhibited only ∼12% (Fig. 1, A and B). These results suggest that either 2-deoxyglucose uptake and translocation are mediated by separate targets of wortmannin or require different amounts of PI 3-kinase activity.To evaluate further whether either of these effects were dependent upon PI3-kinase, the dose response for wortmannin's inhibition of another PI3-kinase-dependent response, activation of pp70 S6-kinase (15Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 33Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), was also measured. Wortmannin inhibited activation of pp70 S6-kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes toward the 40 S ribosome with a dose response resembling that obtained for GLUT4 translocation (Fig.2 A). Although pp70 S6- kinase displayed full activity with 30 nm wortmannin pretreatment, kinase activity fell precipitously upon treatment with 100 nm wortmannin. This result suggests that the target mediating pp70 S6-kinase and GLUT4 translocation are the same and is most likely to be a class I PI3-kinase (33Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). LY294002, which is chemically unrelated to wortmannin, also inhibited insulin-stimulated hexose uptake and GLUT4 translocation with identical dose responses, suggesting that these responses are blocked due to inhibition of p110 PI3-kinase (Fig. 3). This effect is in marked contrast to that with wortmannin (Fig. 1), suggesting that the site of action of wortmannin responsible for selectively inhibiting hexose uptake is not sensitive to LY294002.Figure 2Effect of wortmannin on insulin-stimulated activation of pp70-S6 kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-deprived for ∼24 h and treated with various concentrations of wortmannin for 45 min in the absence (−) or presence (+) of 100 nm insulin (INS) for the last 15 min. Equal amounts of protein from whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-pp70 S6-kinase antisera, and in vitro kinase reactions were performed using 40 S ribosomes as substrate. Ribosomal S6 protein was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the incorporated phosphate was visualized by autoradiography. B, the autoradiograph in A was quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The level of S6 phosphorylation obtained with insulin in the absence of wortmannin was set to 100%, and other values were normalized accordingly. Results are plotted against the dose-response curve for inhibition of GLUT4 translocation from figure (Fig. 1 A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Effect of LY294002 on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with various concentrations of LY294002 for 45 min in the absence (No Insulin) or presence of 100 nm insulin for the last 15 min. The uptake of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose (2-DOG) or the extent of GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface was determined as described, and results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of three experiments.

Kallen R.G. Lienhard G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E486-E494PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that if wortmannin were washed away prior to stimulation with insulin, the wortmannin would remain bound to p110 but possibly not to the high affinity target regulating transport. If this were correct, removal of wortmannin would shift the dose-response curve defining the inhibition of transport by wortmannin, and a curve resembling the one for GLUT4 translocation would result. Consistent with this idea, the sensitivity of GLUT4 translocation to inhibition by wortmannin was identical regardless of whether drug was present or had been washed away 30 min previously (Fig.4 A). However, when hexose uptake was measured after removal of wortmannin, there was a rightward shift in the dose-response curve (Fig. 4 B). The dose responses of these two events were nearly superimposable (Fig.4 C), suggesting strongly that p110 is responsible for GLUT4 translocation and therefore is the target displaying the lower sensitivity to wortmannin.Figure 4Reversibility of inhibition by wortmannin of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with various concentrations of wortmannin for 45 min in the absence (No Insulin) or presence of 100 nm insulin for the last 15 min. The cells were then either not washed (−wash) or washed (+wash) three times with KRP containing 2% BSA and allowed to recover for 30 min before the addition of insulin (100 nm final) for 15 min. Plasma membrane sheets were prepared, stained for GLUT4, and quantitated. The graph shows the mean ± S.E. of three experiments. B, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with wortmannin, washed, and stimulated as described above. The uptake of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose (2-DOG) was measured, and results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of three experiments that were performed in parallel with the GLUT4 translocation experiment depicted in A.

We have previously shown that the aforementioned GLUT4 translocation assay can be applied to microinjected cells (8Hausdorff S.F. Frangioni J.V. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21391-21394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microinjection of anti-p110 antibodies drastically inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation without having any effect on unstimulated cells (Fig.5). This result directly demonstrates the requirement for p110 PI3-kinase in GLUT4 translocation and lends further credence to the assessment that p110 represents the lower affinity target of wortmannin.Figure 5Effect of microinjection of anti-p110 antibodies on GLUT4 translocation. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were injected with either MBPras (1 mg/ml) and anti-p110 antisera (5 mg/ml) or MBPras alone. Cell-surface GLUT4 levels were ascertained as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since many studies have suggested that translocation of GLUT4 is the major contributor to stimulation of hexose uptake by insulin, we were intrigued by the observation that 2-deoxyglucose uptake is inhibited even when there is a full complement of GLUT4 on the plasma membrane. This raised the possibility that in the presence of wortmannin, GLUT4-containing vesicles were docked at the membrane but were unable to fuse. A pre-fusion, docked GLUT4 vesicle population has been invoked to explain the lag between increases in plasma membrane GLUT4 and hexose uptake in rat adipocytes (36Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17820-17829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis in wortmannin-treated cells, we measured translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing a GLUT4 construct with an epitope tag (derived from insulin receptor peptide P2 (37Herrera R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11980-11985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) inserted into the first extracellular loop (3T3-L1/P2 cells). GLUT4/P2 protein can be detected on the cell surface of intact, unpermeabilized 3T3-L1/P2 cells only when GLUT4-containing vesicles have fully fused with the plasma membrane, thus exposing the P2 epitope to the extracellular space (Fig.6). 3T3-L1/P2 adipocytes were treated with wortmannin for 30 min and stimulated with insulin for 15 min, as in the other translocation assays. Fig. 6 shows that the inhibition curve for translocation of GLUT4/P2 in intact cells was identical to that for endogenous GLUT4 (compare with Fig. 1 B), indicating that transporter present on the plasma membrane sheets was accessible to the extracellular space.Figure 6Accessibility of GLUT4 to the extracellular space in the presence of increasing concentrations of wortmannin. 3T3-L1/P2 adipocytes were treated with various concentrations of wortmannin for 45 min in the absence (−insulin) or presence (+insulin) of 100 nm insulin for the last 15 min. The cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, and the intact cells were processed in the absence of detergent for indirect immunofluorescence with affinity purified anti-P2 peptide antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since GLUT1 also moves to the plasma membrane in response to insulin, we next examined whether translocation of GLUT1-containing vesicles was inhibited by wortmannin. Since the “fold” increase in GLUT1 on the plasma membrane in response to insulin is substantially less than that for GLUT4 (38Calderhead D.M. Kitagawa K. Tanner L.I. Holman G.D. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13801-13808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Calderhead D.M. Kitagawa K. Lienhard G.E. Gould G.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), changes in the former transporter were more difficult to ascertain by the sheet assay. Nonetheless, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with varying concentrations of wortmannin and LY294002 for 30 min, followed by stimulation with 100 nminsulin for 15 min, significantly inhibited the translocation of GLUT1 to the cell surface (Fig. 7). Inhibition of GLUT1 translocation was quantitated by image processing, and the results show that translocation of GLUT1 is almost fully inhibited by 1 nm wortmannin (Fig. 7). Thus, translocation of GLUT1 was significantly more sensitive to inhibition by wortmannin than GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.Figure 7Effect of wortmannin on insulin-stimulated GLUT1 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated with various concentrations of wortmannin (A) or LY294002 (B) for 45 min in the absence (NO INSULIN) or presence of 100 nm insulin for the last 15 min. The extent of GLUT1 translocation to the cell surface was determined by the plasma membrane sheet assay and was quantitated as described. The abundance of GLUT1 on the plasma membrane sheets in the presence of insulin but without drugs was set to 100%, and all other values were then normalized accordingly. Results are presented as the means ± S.E. of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since the identity of the higher affinity target for wortmannin is still unknown, it was critical to ascertain whether wortmannin inhibits the transporters directly. To accomplish this, we assayed the the effect of wortmannin on 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing a constitutively active form of the serine/threonine kinase Akt (Myr-Akt). Akt is positively regulated by insulin via a PI3-kinase-dependent mechanism, and constitutively active forms of Akt stimulate numerous events involving PI3-kinase (40Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). For example, Myr-Akt increases glucose uptake by both stimulating GLUT4 translocation and increasing expression of GLUT1 (26Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar), although its necessity in insulin-stimulated glucose transport has been questioned (41Kitamura T.

Cell. 1998; 2: 729-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and has been shown to participate in IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, gp130, TPO, SCF, CSF-1, BCR, and TCR signaling (34Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Itoh M. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Shirogane T. Astumi T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Blood. 1999; 93: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gu H. Pratt J.C. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 729-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Both Gab1 and Gab2 contain multiple sites for tyrosine phosphorylation and motifs for binding of SH2 and SH3 containing proteins. In addition, both Gab1 and Gab2 contain a c-Met binding domain and are related to the Drosophila homologue Daughter of Sevenless (DOS). The greatest amino acid sequence identity within the Gab/DOS proteins are found in their pleckstrin homology domains (34Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Itoh M. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Shirogane T. Astumi T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Blood. 1999; 93: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gu H. Pratt J.C. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 729-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Although IRS proteins have similar structure, they can be distinguished from Gab/DOS proteins by their pleckstrin homology domains and other sequence elements. Therefore, it is likely that, in addition to mediating the activation of common pathways, Gab proteins have also distinct signaling and biological functions as compared with other IRS proteins. In the current study we determined whether members of the Gab family of proteins are involved in EPO signaling in the EPO-dependent cell lines HCD57, DA3ER, and in highly purified human primary erythroid progenitors. Our data demonstrate that EPO induces strong tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and Gab2, and that both Gab1 and Gab2 interact with the p85 subunit of the PI 3′-kinase and the SHP2 phosphatase, suggesting that their function is required for the engagement of these proteins by the EPO receptor. In addition, our data show that the proteins are differentially expressed in various cell lines, while only Gab1 is expressed in primary hematopoietic progenitors. In studies with DA3 cells expressing different EPO receptor mutants we identify tyrosines 367 and 425 in the EPO receptor, as the sites required for the engagement of the Gab pathway in EPO signaling. HCD57 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (BioWhittaker Inc., Walkerville, MD), 25% fetal calf serum, 10 μg/ml gentamicin, 1 unit of EPO/ml at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment. DA3ER and DA3ER mutant cell lines were cultured in RPMI media, 10% fetal calf serum, 10 μg/ml gentamicin, 4 units of EPO/ml at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment as described previously (18Tauchi T. Toyama K. Feng G.S. Broxmeyer H.E. Krystal G. Blood. 1996; 87: 4495-4501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All other cell lines were maintained in RPMI media, 10% fetal calf serum, 10 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2environment. Human BFU-E were purified from peripheral blood obtained from normal volunteers. Informed consent was obtained from the volunteers after approval from the Institutional Review Board at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The purified BFU-E cells were cultured for 7 or 8 days to obtain a highly enriched population of erythroid progenitors that were at the CFU-E stage of differentiation as described previously (4Jacobs-Helber S.M. Wickrema A. Birrder M.J. Sawyer S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 36Wickrema A. Krantz S.B. Winkelmann J.C. Bondurant M.C. Blood. 1992; 80: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 to 400 ml of whole blood was separated over Ficoll-Hypaque (1.077 g/ml) to obtain mononuclear cells. Platelets were depleted by centrifugation over a 10% bovine serum albumin gradient, followed by adherent cell depletion in polystyrene tissue culture flasks. The cell population was enriched for BFU-E by negative selection with MACSTM antibody-coated paramagnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Inc., Auburn, CA) bearing CD3, CD11b, CD15, and CD45 RA. Day 0 cells were then cultured for 7 days to obtain highly purified erythroid progenitors at the CFU-E stage of differentiation. Eighty to ninety percent of these cells were positive for CD71 and glycophorin A as determined by flow cytometry and produced erythroid colonies when plated in methylcellulose. The culture medium contained 15% fetal calf serum, 15% human AB serum, Isocove's modified Dulbecco's medium, 500 units/ml penicillin, 40 μg/ml streptomycin/ml, 10 ng/ml interleukin-3, 2 units/ml EPO, 50 units/ml insulin-like growth factor-1, 50 ng/ml stem cell factor. Hematopoietic stem cell progenitors (CD34+ Lin− population) were isolated from adult bone marrow by flow cytometry after the initial selection of CD34+ population by a CD34 selection kit (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA). The lineage panel (Lin) consisted of CD2, CD14, CD15, CD19, and glycophorin A. Anti-Gab1, anti-PI 3-kinase, IRS-2, and anti-Jak-2 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-Gab2 antibody has been previously described (34Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Itoh M. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Shirogane T. Astumi T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Blood. 1999; 93: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An anti-EPOR antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). An anti-SHP2 antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. An antibody against IRS-1 was provided by Dr. Morris White (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA). Prior to growth factor stimulation, HCD57 cells were centrifuged and the cell pellets were washed two times with Isocove's modified Dulbecco's medium and cultured in Isocove's modified Dulbecco's medium, 25% fetal calf serum without growth factors for 16–18 h. 30 × 106cells were treated with 10 units/ml EPO or left untreated. DA3ER cells and DA3ER mutants were also deprived of EPO for 16–18 h, and treated with 50 units/ml EPO. Human primary erythroid progenitors were stimulated on day 8 of culture. Prior to EPO stimulation, the human erythroid progenitors cells were starved in serum-free medium without growth factors for 4 h. 20 × 106 cells were treated with 10 units/ml EPO or left untreated. Cells were lysed in a phosphorylation lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies, and after five washes with phosphorylation lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Immobilon), and the residual binding sites on the filters were blocked by incubating with TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.05% Tween 20), 20% bovine serum albumin for 1–3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The filters were subsequently incubated with the indicated antibodies and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit following the manufacturer's recommended procedure (Amersham). PCR amplification was performed on isolated RNA from various cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells using a RNA Core Kit (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using random hexamers for first strand synthesis. The synthesized cDNA was equally divided and used for PCR amplification of Gab1, Gab2, and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). PCR amplification was performed with specific forward and reverse primers for Gab1 (forward, 5′-CCTGTTGCTCATCAACTGTCAAAGC-3′; reverse, 5′-CTACA CTCGATGTCCCAGATGGG-3′) and Gab2 (forward, 5′-GCCACTCCTGGAGATTCAGCC- 3′; reverse, 5′-GTCAGGCTTGAGGTTTCGGTTG-3′) using the following conditions: 1 cycle at 94 °C/2 min; 5 cycles at 94 °C/10 s, 65.5 °C/2 min; 5 cycles at 94 °C/10 s, 62.5 °C/2 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C/10 s, 62 °C/2 min, 72 °C/10 min. Control PCR amplifications were performed using specific forward and reverse primers for GAPDH (forward, 5′GGCTGAGAACGGGAAGCTTG TCAT-3′ and reverse, 5′-CAGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGA-3′) using similar conditions. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (37Uddin S. Fish E.N. Sher D.A. Gardziola C. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2390-2397PubMed Google Scholar). We initially sought to determine whether Gab1 and Gab2 are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to EPO treatment of HCD57 cells. Cells were stimulated with EPO after starvation and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Gab1 or anti-Gab2 antibodies, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins corresponding to Gab1 and Gab2 were observed after EPO stimulation in the anti-phosphotyrosine blots, while there was no change in the amount of these proteins immunoprecipitated from lysates of EPO-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 1, A-D). In addition, a tyrosylphosphoprotein migrating at approximately 72 kDa was co-immunoprecipitated by both anti-Gab1 and anti-Gab2 antibodies after EPO treatment of cells (Fig. 1, A and C). We subsequently determined if IRS-1 and/or IRS-2 are tyrosine phosphorylated by EPO in HCD57. We could not detect EPO-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, while IRS-2 was heavily phosphorylated in the absence of EPO in these cells and its phosphorylation status did not change after EPO treatment (Fig.1 E). Thus, in these cells, Gab1 and Gab2, but not IRS-1 or IRS-2, appear to be the principal IRS proteins activated by EPO, strongly suggesting that their phosphorylation is critical for the generation of EPO- induced signals. In studies to determine the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1, we found that its activation was rapid and transient, reaching a maximum level of phosphorylation at 15 min, with the signal diminishing after 30 min of EPO treatment. In addition, the Gab1-associated 72-kDa tyrosylphosphoprotein followed a similar time course of phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A). We then sought to determine the expression pattern of Gab1 and Gab2 proteins in various hematopoietic cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells (CD34+ Lin−) by RT-PCR. These cell lines represented all the major hematopoietic lineages. The primary cells that were utilized in the study consisted of highly purified human early hematopoietic stem cell progenitors and highly purified human erythroid progenitors that are at the CFU-E stage of differentiation. Fig. 3 shows the expression pattern of Gab1, Gab2, and GAPDH mRNA for each of the cell types utilized in the study. Gab1 is clearly expressed in all the cell lines and in primary hematopoietic progenitors although in the EPO-dependent myeloid cell line DA3ER Gab1 expression is absent. On the other hand, Gab2 mRNA expression was limited to HCD57, DA3ER, and TF-1 cells. We were unable to detect the expression of Gab2 transcripts in early human hematopoietic stem cell progenitors and committed human erythroid progenitors at the CFU-E stage of differentiation. The bands obtained for Gab1 (316bp) and Gab2(512bp) were specific for cDNA (+RT) as no bands were detected in the absence of reverse transcriptase (−RT) during the cDNA synthesis step (Fig. 3). Control PCR amplification with primers to GAPDH confirmed that the isolated RNA could be PCR amplified and the quantity of RNA used was similar for all the tissues. Furthermore, DNA sequencing of all positive reactions confirmed the amplification of Gab1 and Gab2 transcripts from these cell types (data not shown). Since RT-PCR experiments indicated that Gab1 was the only Gab transcript that was detected in primary erythroid progenitors, we sought to determine whether Gab1 is phosphorylated in response to EPO treatment of highly purified human erythroid progenitors. Fig.4 shows that Gab1 is phosphorylated in an EPO-dependent manner and that such tyrosine phosphorylation is rapid, reaching a maximum level of phosphorylation at 15 min, with the signal diminishing after 30 min of EPO treatment. A second unidentified protein that closely migrated with Gab1 was co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-Gab1 antibody and was also phosphorylated by EPO (Fig. 4). This was in addition to the Gab1-associated 72-kDa tyrosylphosphoprotein that was seen in the EPO-dependent cell lines (Fig. 4). Greater than 90% of the cells studied were CD71/glycophorin A positive as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 4, bottom panel), indicating that they were purified progenitors committed to the erythroid lineage. We next sought to determine whether the p85 regulatory subunit of the PI 3′-kinase interacts with Gab1 and/or Gab2 during EPO stimulation. Fig. 5 A shows an experiment in which lysates from HCD57 cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Gab1 antibody, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis and immunoblotting with an antibody against the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3′-kinase. Association of p85 was detectable before EPO stimulation and increased after EPO stimulation in an EPO-dependent manner, strongly suggesting that the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of Gab1 provides docking sites for the binding of the SH2 domains of PI 3′-kinase during EPO stimulation. However, as there was some constitutive association of p85 with Gab1, it is possible that the SH3 domain of the PI 3′-kinase or other p85-interacting proteins can associate with Gab1 and this needs to be determined in future studies. To determine whether the serine kinase activity of the PI 3′-kinase is induced during its interaction with Gab1, in vitro kinase assays were performed on anti-Gab1 immunoprecipitates. Fig. 5 B shows that, after EPO stimulation, kinase activity is clearly detectable in anti-Gab1 immunoprecipitates and a phosphorylated protein corresponding to p85 is detected, strongly suggesting that the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3′-kinase is activated during the association of p85 with Gab1. Fig.5 C shows an experiment in which lysates from HCD57 cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Gab2 antibody, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis and immunoblotting with an antibody against the p85 regulatory subunit of the PI 3′-kinase. There was some baseline interaction between Gab2 and p85 detected. Such an interaction increased significantly after treatment with Epo, suggesting that the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of Gab2 also binds the SH2 domains of P85 during Epo stimulation. Thus both members of the Gab family of proteins provide docking sites for the engagement of PI 3′-kinase in EPO-induced signaling. We subsequently sought to identify the 72-kDa protein that was phosphorylated and co-immunoprecipitated with Gab1 and Gab2 during EPO stimulation. As the relative molecular mass (Mr) of this protein was similar to the Mr of the EPO receptor and the Mr of the SHP2 phosphatase, we performed studies to determine if the EPO receptor or the SHP2 phosphatase can be detected in association with Gab1 during EPO stimulation. HCD57 cells were stimulated with EPO for different times and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against Gab1, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig.6 A). The 72-kDa protein co-migrated with the EPO receptor, but it was not recognized by an antibody specific for the EPOR (Fig. 6 A, middle panel). However, when anti-SHP2 immunoblots were performed, we found that the protein was recognized by an anti-SHP2 monoclonal antibody (Fig.6 A, bottom panel), establishing that it corresponds, at least in part, to the SHP2 phosphatase. Thus, in addition to binding the p85 regulatory subunit of the PI 3′-kinase, Gab1 interacts with the SHP2 phosphatase, strongly suggesting that its docking function recruits SHP2 in EPO signaling. Similarly, when anti-SHP2 immunoblots were performed on anti-Gab2 immunoprecipitates from EPO-treated cells, we found that SHP2 associates with Gab2 in an EPO-dependent manner, suggesting that Gab2 also provides a binding site for SHP2 (Fig. 6 B). To identify the domains in the EPO receptor that are required for EPO-dependent phosphorylation of Gab proteins, we determined Gab2 phosphorylation in a series of DA3 cell line transfectants, expressing different mutations of the EPO receptor. Each of these mutants lacked one phosphotyrosine residue due to the substitution of phenylalanine in place of tyrosine, with the exception of the ERH mutant, which contained only the most proximal tyrosine residue to the cytoplasm and lacked seven of the eight tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of the erythropoietin receptor. Fig. 7 shows phosphotyrosine immunoblots using five such mutant clones of DA3ER cells. Lysates from EPO-stimulated cells of the different transfectants were immunoprecipitated with Gab2 and Jak2 antibodies. The cells expressing EPO receptors with mutated tyrosines 367 and 425 (Y367F and Y425F) showed no phosphorylation of Gab2 in response to EPO, although there was strong activation of Jak2, suggesting that these phosphotyrosine residues are required for the activation of Gab2. Similarly, no tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab2 was seen in cells expressing the ERH mutant, in which seven of the eight tyrosines including tyrosines 367 and 425 were not present. However, in Y453F and Y467F expressing cells, there was phosphorylation of Gab2, indicating that these phosphotyrosine residues are not required for its activation. Thus tyrosines 367 and 425 in the EPO receptor are required for engagement of Gab2 in EPO signaling. Gab1 and Gab2 are recently cloned members of the Gab family of proteins which are related to the IRS proteins (31Holgado-Madruga M.D.R.E. Mosacatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wang A.J. Nature. 1996; 319: 560-564Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Many of the motifs present in IRS-1 are conserved in Gab1, including three tyrosines in Y XX M motifs that provide docking sites for the p85 regulatory subunit of the PI 3′-kinase and a tyrosine in a Y X DL motif that binds the SH2 domain of the SHP2 phosphatase. Recent studies have demonstrated that Gab1 and Gab2 are activated and engaged in signaling via the insulin, epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, IL-6, and other cytokine receptors (31Holgado-Madruga M.D.R.E.

Extensive previous studies have demonstrated that erythropoietin activates multiple signaling cascades to generate mitogenic and differentiation signals, including the PI 3′-kinase pathway and a pathway regulated by the SHP2 phosphatase (18Tauchi T.

It has been also demonstrated that activation of the PI 3′-kinase plays an important role in the induction of EPO-mediated cell proliferation (6Damen J.E. Mui A.L. Cutler R.L. Krystal G.

Broxmeyer H.E. Krystal G. Blood. 1996; 87: 4495-4501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Tauchi T. Feng G.-S. Shen R. Hoatlin M. Baby Jr., G.C. Kabat D. Lu L. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5631-5635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The present study implicates Gab proteins as the principal IRS proteins activated by the erythropoietin receptor. Previous studies using the UT-7 multipotential human leukemia cell line have established that IRS-2 is also tyrosine phosphorylated during EPO treatment and associates with the p85 subunit of the PI 3′-kinase, suggesting that this protein is also involved in erythropoietin signaling (30Verdier F. Chretient S. Billat C. Gisselbrecht S. Lacombe C. Mayeux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26173-26178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In our studies, using HCD57 cells and primary human erythroid progenitors, we failed to detect EPO-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 or IRS-2. The lack of detection of EPO-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 in HCD57 cells may be due to the heavy baseline tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein. However, only Gab proteins and not IRS-2, were found to associate with the SHP2 phosphatase during treatment of cells with EPO (data not shown), indicating that SHP2 requires Gab proteins and not IRS-2 for its engagement in erythropoietin signaling. These findings are consistent with previous studies performed in UT-7 cells, in which no association between IRS-2 and SHP2 was detected (30Verdier F. Chretient S. Billat C. Gisselbrecht S. Lacombe C. Mayeux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26173-26178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our data also showed that Gab proteins bind the p85 subunit of the PI 3′-kinase. Previous studies have shown that the p85 subunit of the PI 3′-kinase binds directly to EPO receptor (9Miura O. Nakamura N. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 614-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus our findings strongly suggest and provide evidence that an alternative pathway for the activation of PI 3′-kinase by EPO involves Gab proteins. The examination of the expression pattern of Gab proteins in various hematopoietic cells revealed that Gab1 is expressed ubiquitously, whereas expression of Gab2 is selective. Among the cell lines utilized in the study, only the EPO-dependent erythroid cell line HCD57 and TF-1 showed expression of both Gab1 and Gab2. Since Gab1 and Gab2 contain similar structural characteristics (potential phosphorylation sites and their relative positions are conserved in addition to preservation of the pleckstrin homology domain) it would be interesting to determine whether the function of these two proteins are redundant in these cells or they mediate separate biological functions. It is conceivable that in many of the hematopoietic cells, the functional roles of Gab1 and Gab2 are interchangeable. Highly purified primary erythroid progenitors and early uncommitted hematopoietic cells showed expression of only Gab1, indicating that at least in erythroid lineage cells, Gab1 transcripts are continuously expressed throughout differentiation. Upon EPO stimulation both Gab1 and Gab2 are tyrosine phosphorylated and form complexes with SHP2 and the p85 subunit of the PI 3-kinase. Our data using DA3ER mutants lacking individual tyrosine residues (Y425F and Y367F) within the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO receptor indicate that both tyrosines 425 and 367 are critical for the phosphorylation of Gab2 by EPO. This is in contrast to a previous study in which it was shown that the tyrosine residues of the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 are not necessary for the activation of Gab proteins (33Takahashi-Tezuka M. Yoshida Y. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Yamanaka Y. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4109-41117Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Also, the same study utilized a gp130 receptor mutant expressed in 293T cells in which the SHP2-binding site of gp130 was mutated to phenylalanine. When gp130 is stimulated in these cells there is no association of SHP2 with Gab1 although Gab1 is phosphorylated. Taken together with our data, the results of these studies indicate the existence of different mechanisms for phosphorylation of Gab proteins based on the ligand activating them. Our results suggest that in EPO signal transduction, at least two tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO receptor are needed to phosphorylate Gab proteins. Furthermore, our finding, that Gab2 is not phosphorylated in cells expressing EPO receptors lacking tyrosine 425 raise the possibility that the Gab pathway mediates EPO-dependent mitogenic signals. A previous study (40Damen J.E. Cutler R.L. Jiao H. Yi T. Krystal J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23402-23408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that this tyrosine in the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO receptor promotes cell growth in response to EPO, and in cells expressing EPO receptors lacking this tyrosine residue, the mitogenic effects of EPO are diminished. As this residue is also required for engagement of the SHP2 phosphatase (38Tauchi T. Feng G.-S. Shen R. Hoatlin M. Baby Jr., G.C. Kabat D. Lu L. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5631-5635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 40Damen J.E. Cutler R.L. Jiao H. Yi T. Krystal J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23402-23408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it is tempting to hypothesize that Gab proteins are the primary pathway for the activation of SHP2, which mediates mitogenic effects, in EPO signaling. Although further work is required to precisely define the role of Gab1 and Gab2 in the regulation of the biological effects of erythropoietin, our data strongly suggest that these proteins, and not the related IRS-1 and IRS-2, are the principal docking proteins in EPO signaling. It is likely that, in addition to SHP2 and p85 proteins, Gab1 and Gab2 provide docking sites for other known and unknown proteins activated by the EPO receptor, which remain to be identified in future studies."

In this pathway, phase separation is followed by a dewetting process at the interface between the two phases. Dewetting proceeds (from the sample edges inward) as holes form. The initially smooth film breaks up into droplets at rates much faster than those allowed by classical rupture mechanisms. Marangoni flow appears to be responsible for the initiation of the flow of the dewetting front, and coupling between the flow in the two phases leads to accelerated hole formation."

We observed that recombinant MCD protein has high intrinsic malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity and that a malonyl-CoA decarboxylase-deficient patient has a severe mutation in the MCD gene (c.947–948delTT), confirming that this gene encodes human MCD. Subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that MCD resides in both the cytoplasm and peroxisomes. Cytoplasmic MCD is positioned to play a role in the regulation of cytoplasmic malonyl-CoA abundance and, thus, of mitochondrial fatty acid uptake and oxidation. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that malonyl-CoA decarboxylase-deficient patients display a number of phenotypes that are reminiscent of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorders. Additional support for this hypothesis comes from our observation that MCD mRNA is most abundant in cardiac and skeletal muscles, tissues in which cytoplasmic malonyl-CoA is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and which derive significant amounts of energy from fatty acid oxidation. As for the role of peroxisomal MCD, we propose that this enzyme may be involved in degrading intraperoxisomal malonyl-CoA, which is generated by the peroxisomal β-oxidation of odd chain-length dicarboxylic fatty acids. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) catalyzes the proton-consuming conversion of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and CO2.

Kolattukudy P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 234-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 2Kim Y.S. Kolattukudy P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 3An J.H. Kim Y.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of this enzyme is somewhat unclear. The only eukaryotic malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD)1 gene that has been cloned was goose (Anser anser), which expresses two MCD transcripts from a single gene (4Jang S.H. Cheesbrough T.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3500-3505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The longer of the two transcripts is ubiquitously expressed and encodes a mitochondrial enzyme, whereas the shorter form has a more restricted pattern of expression and encodes a cytosolic enzyme. The mitochondrial localization of goose MCD suggested that this enzyme may function in removing intramitochondrial malonyl-CoA that is produced by the adventitious activity of propionyl-CoA carboxylase on acetyl-CoA. As for the cytosolic form of the enzyme, it was hypothesized to participate in the synthesis of methyl branched-chain fatty acids (5Courchesne-Smith C. Jang S.-H. Shi Q. DeWille J. Sasaki G. Kolattukudy P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 576-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although these hypotheses may explain the localization and function of goose MCD, metabolic studies raise the possibility that there are additional physiologically relevant roles for this enzyme. In mammals, cytoplasmic malonyl-CoA is a potent inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1) and, thus, of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (6McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). In adipogenic tissues such as liver and white fat, acetyl-CoA carboxylase produces cytoplasmic malonyl-CoA under fed conditions as a precursor for fatty acid synthesis, and fatty acid synthase consumes this cytoplasmic pool of malonyl-CoA. However, nonadipogenic tissues such as cardiac and skeletal muscle also produce significant quantities of cytoplasmic malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA carboxylase (7Ha J. Lee J.-K. Kim K.-S. Witters L.A. Kim K.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11466-11470Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and the inhibitory effects of malonyl-CoA on CPT1 are roughly 100-fold greater in these tissues than in liver (6McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). The synthesis of cytoplasmic malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase in muscle is tightly regulated by the AMP-dependent protein kinase (8Vavvas D. Apazdis A. Saha A.K. Gamble J. Patel A. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13255-13261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), which inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase and blocks malonyl-CoA synthesis under conditions which require that muscle use fatty acids as their primary energy source (i.e. fasted and/or exercised states). However, there is currently no model for how these tissues degrade the cytoplasmic malonyl-CoA that is produced by acetyl-CoA carboxylase, even though this process is critical for the activation of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. One possible model is that a cytoplasmic form of MCD could act to remove cytoplasmic malonyl-CoA under conditions that inhibit acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thereby allowing mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to resume. An additional role for MCD could be in the oxidation of dicarboxylic fatty acids (DFAs). In contrast to long and medium chain fatty acids, which are oxidized primarily in the mitochondria, DFAs are oxidized only in peroxisomes (9Suzuki H. Yamada J. Watanabe T. Suga T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 990: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). DFA oxidation is poorly understood, and it is not clear whether peroxisomes degrade DFAs completely to malonyl-CoA (for odd chain-length DFAs) and oxalyl-CoA (for even chain-length DFAs). However, if the β-oxidation of DFAs in peroxisomes is complete, a peroxisomal form of MCD could function to eliminate this metabolic end-product of odd chain-length DFA oxidation. A key role for malonyl-CoA decarboxylase in mammalian metabolism is suggested by the severe phenotypes of patients who lack this enzyme activity. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, also known as malonic aciduria, is a genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay, cardiomyopathy, mental retardation, and in its more severe forms, neonatal death (10Brown G.K. Scholem R.D. Bankier A. Danks D.M. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1984; 7: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Haan E.A. Scholem R.D. Croll H.B. Brown G.K. Eur. J.

Dis. 1993; 16: 571-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These patients have several phenotypes that are reminiscent of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation deficiencies, including diet-induced and infection-induced vomiting, seizures, hypoglycemia, and organic aciduria, as well as cardiomyopathy. Here we report the identification of a novel human gene encoding malonyl-CoA decarboxylase. Its role in malonic aciduria, its pattern of expression, the subcellular distribution of its product, and its possible roles in cellular metabolism are discussed. We searched the ExPASy TrEMBL/EMBL data bases for all proteins terminating in possible forms of the PTS1. This data base scan identified goose malonyl-CoA decarboxylase as a candidate peroxisomal protein because it ends in the canonical PTS1 of serine-lysine-leucineCOOH (15Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). To determine whether the human gene also encoded a protein with a PTS1, and thus might encode a peroxisomal protein, we searched for human homologues of goose MCD. The goose MCD protein sequence was used as query in a BLAST search of the human data base of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for any genes that had the potential to encode proteins with high sequence similarity to goose MCD. Multiple human ESTs were identified, all of which appeared to represent a single human gene. The longest of these at the time, GenBankTM accession number N52074, corresponded to the cDNA clone 282566 and was obtained from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO). This clone was sequenced in its entirety. Based on its similarity to the goose isoforms of MCD, this human MCD clone lacked the first 170 codons relative to goose cytosolic MCD and the first 230 codons relative to goose mitochondrial MCD. To obtain additional sequence data for the 5′ end of the human MCD cDNA, we used an MCD-specific primer (5′-CTCCTTGACGACTCGCTTTATGAGG-3′) and a library vector-specific primer (5′-ATACCATTACAATGGATG-3′) to amplify 5′ fragments of the MCD gene from a human heart cDNA library (MCD expression is higher in muscle than in any other tissues). The largest band that was generated was approximately 900-bp long. Subcloning and sequencing of this clone revealed that it overlapped with our truncated MCD cDNA clone and added about 600 bp to the 5′ end of the MCD sequence. The assembled 2,121-bp MCD sequence contained a 95-bp 5′ untranslated region, a 1,362-bp open reading frame (ORF), and a 664-bp 3′ untranslated region. Its deduced protein product of 454 amino acids initiated at the same relative position as the goose cytosolic MCD (5Courchesne-Smith C. Jang S.-H. Shi Q. DeWille J. Sasaki G. Kolattukudy P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 576-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our most recent data base searches revealed the presence of 34 ESTs for human MCD. None of these are as long as our assembled “full-length”MCD cDNA. However, four of these (GenBankTMaccession numbers AI1284158, AI379572, AI123407, and AA015957) do appear to contain the entire MCD ORF and start at positions −50, −32, −31, and −1, respectively, relative to the A of the putative initiator ATG in the sequence we have assembled. We also identified a human genomic DNA clone for the MCD locus by screening a bacterial artificial chromosome library of human genomic DNAs with a 190-bp probe from the 5′ end of the MCD cDNA. An 8-kilobase Xba I fragment containing the 5′ end of the MCD gene was generated from the MCD bacterial artificial chromosome clone, and the structure of the MCD gene upstream of the 5′ end of the MCD cDNA was determined by sequence analysis of this DNA fragment. An oligonucleotide corresponding to the 22 bp immediately upstream of the 5′ end of the MCD cDNA (5′-ACCATGCGAGGCTTCGGGGCCAGGCTTG-3′) was used in PCR reactions to test for the expression of a longer cDNA product that might contain a second, upstream ATG. 5′-RACE experiments were also performed but failed to generate any MCD cDNA clones longer than the cDNA reported here. Additional BLAST sequence searches were used to identify a putative Caenorhabditis elegans form of MCD (GenBank accession number Z46242). A portion of the MCD ORF encoding amino acids 187 to 451 was amplified using the primers 5′-CCAGTCGACGGACATGAAGCGCCGCGTTGGGCC-3′ and 5′-CCAAGCGGCCGCTCAAAGCTTCCAGTTCTTTTGAAACTGGGCCACTAGGC-3′ and the cDNA clone 282566 as template. The resulting PCR product was cleaved with Sal I and Not I and cloned between the Sal I and Not I sites of pMBP, a variant of pMALc2 (New England Biolabs) that contains unique Sal I and Not I sites for insertion of fragments downstream of the maltose-binding protein (MBP) ORF (16Geisbrecht B.V.

The resulting plasmid, pMBP-MCD/187–451, was the source for a recombinant MCD fragment that was used for immunization of rabbits and generation of affinity purified anti-MCD antibodies. Another set of primers (5′-CCAGTCGACGATGGACGAGCTGCTGCGCCG-3′ and 5′-CCAAGCGGCCGCTCAAAGCTTCGAGTTCTTTTGAAACTGGGCCACTAGGC-3′) was used to amplify the entire MCD ORF in the correct reading frame for fusion to MBP in pMBP. The template for this reaction was a human heart cDNA library. A product of the expected length was generated, cleaved with Sal I and Not I and cloned between the Sal I and Not I sites of pMBP. The insert in this plasmid (pMBP-MCD) was sequenced in its entirety, confirming the full-length sequence assembled from the overlapping MCD cDNAs described in the cDNA cloning section above. This plasmid was used for generating full-length recombinant MCD that was used for enzyme assays. To create pcDNA3-MCD, the Eco RI-Not I fragment containing the MCD cDNA was excised from pMBP-MCD and inserted between the Eco RI and Not I sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego). Recombinant MCD lacking its first 186 amino acids and last 3 amino acids was expressed in fusion with MBP from an Escherichia coli strain DH10B (17Grant S.G. Jessee J. Bloom F.R. Hanahan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4645-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) carrying the plasmid pMBP-MCD/187–451. Full-length MCD was expressed in fusion with MBP from DH10B cells carrying the plasmid pMBP-MCD. MBP-LacZ was expressed from DH10B cells carrying pMALc2. All three proteins were expressed and purified as described by Geisbrecht et al. (16Geisbrecht B.V. Zhu D. Schulz K. Nau K. Morrell J.C. Geraghty M. Schulz H. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33184-33191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), with the exception that cells were induced overnight at room temperature. MBP-MCD/187–451 was used for the immunization of rabbits and affinity purification of anti-MCD antibodies, as described (18Crane D.I. Kalish J.E. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21835-21844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant MBP-MCD and MBP-LacZ were used for the analysis of MCD enzyme activity. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity was assayed by coupling the MCD reaction to malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase and by measuring the production of NADH spectrophotometrically, as described by Kim and Kolattukudy (2Kim Y.S. Kolattukudy P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Only initial rates were used in the calculation of Km and vmax. Assays for catalase (19Peters T.J. Muller M. de Duve C. J. Exp. Med. 1972; 136: 1117-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and succinate dehydrogenase (20Pennington R.J. Biochem. J. 1961; 80: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) have been described. Whole cell protein extracts for use in immunoblotting were prepared from cultured human HepG2 cells, a hepatoblastoma cell line, and 5756T cells, a human skin fibroblast cell line. A nearly confluent flask (150 cm2) of cells was resuspended in a solution of 30 mm Tris, 1 mmEDTA, 1% SDS, pH 8.0. The suspension was incubated for 10 min on ice, then spun at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant containing soluble protein was removed and resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer. Coupled in vitro transcription and translation of human MCD was performed with TNT in vitro translation reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI) and the pcDNA3-MCD plasmid. Subcellular fractionation of rat liver was performed as described (21Mihalik S.J. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1992; 357: 239-244Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed using standard protocols and human multitissue Northern blots from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Human fibroblast RNA was extracted from cultured fibroblast monolayers using PureScript reagents and protocols (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Human genomic DNA was prepared from cultured human skin fibroblasts using PureGene reagents and protocols (Gentra). Synthesis of MCD first strand cDNA was performed as described (22Michaud J. Brody L. Steel G. Fontaine G. Martin L. Valle D. Mitchell G. Genomics. 1992; 13: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,23Warren D.S. Morrell J.C. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) using the MCD-specific primer MCD-RT (5′-ACGGCTAAAGCAACCATCGC-3′). For analysis of the 5′ end of the MCD cDNA, the antisense oligonucleotides MCD-RACE.1 (5′-CCACCTGGCCGTGGTCCACGCCGAAGC-3′) and MCD-RACE.2 (5′-GCCCACCGTAGAAGCTCACG-3′) were used in combination with the MCDstart (5′-ATGGACGAGCTGCTGCGCCG-3′) and MCD-hypoATG (5′-ATGCGAGGCTTCGGGCCAGGC-3′) oligonucleotides. The human heart cDNA library was obtained from CLONTECH. For mutation detection studies, RNA was extracted from fibroblasts derived from a severely affected malonic aciduria patient (MA002), first strand cDNA was synthesized as noted above, and two overlapping fragments of the MCD cDNA were amplified from the MA002 first strand MCD cDNA by PCR using the following oligonucleotide pairs: MCDstart and MCD-N3 (5′-CCTTGACGACTCGCTTTATG-3′), and MCD-C5 (5′-GCAACATCCAGGCAATCGTG-3′) and MCD-C3 (5′-TGCGGGACAAGAACACAGTC-3′). The resulting PCR products were sequenced directly using the same oligonucleotides used in the PCR reactions. We previously described the development and application of context sensitive motif scanning for the in silico identification of novel peroxisomal proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (24Geraghty M.T. Bassett D. Morrell J.C. Gatto G.J. Bai J. Geisbrecht B.V. Hieter P. Gould S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2937-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We applied a similar approach to identify candidate peroxisomal proteins in data bases from higher eukaryotes. One of the many candidates that were identified was the goose malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (A. anser MCD). This enzyme contains a perfect match to the consensus sequence for the type-1 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1), serine-lysine-leucineCOOH (15Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) and suggested that MCD might contribute to peroxisomal metabolic processes. However, it seemed that an analysis of human MCD would have greater general relevance, because there is a larger body of work on the physiological effects of malonyl-CoA in mammalian tissues (6McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar) and because malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency is associated with defects in this enzyme (10Brown G.K. Scholem R.D. Bankier A. Danks D.M. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1984; 7: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Haan E.A. Scholem R.D. Croll H.B. Brown G.K. Eur. J.

Dis. 1993; 16: 571-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We used a computer-based approach to identify the human malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene. The BLAST algorithm was used to scan the data base of human expressed sequence tags for cDNAs capable of encoding proteins similar to goose malonyl-CoA decarboxylase. Multiple overlapping ESTs corresponding to a single gene were identified. The cDNA clone that appeared to have the longest 5′ end was obtained from a commercial vendor and sequenced in its entirety. This clone appeared to be missing several hundred base pairs from the 5′ end. Additional MCD cDNA clones containing another 600 bp at the 5′ end were obtained from a human heart cDNA library, allowing us to assemble an apparent full-length cDNA for human MCD. The compiled human MCD cDNA sequence (Fig.1) is 2,121-bp long and contains a 1,362-bp open reading frame. The presumptive initiator ATG has a good match to the consensus sequence for high efficiency translation initiation (25Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 26Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), particularly because it has purines at both the −3 and +4 positions, relative to the A of the ATG. The deduced protein product is 454-amino acids long, has a predicted molecular mass of approximately 50 kDa, and starts at exactly the same relative position as the goose cytoplasmic MCD (Fig. 2). Furthermore, it also contains the canonical PTS1 of serine-lysine-leucineCOOH. We also identified partial cDNA clones for the mouse and rat forms of MCD, and they also encode proteins that contain a PTS1 (data not shown). Additional data base searches led to the identification of the putative C. elegans MCD, which does not contain a peroxisomal targeting signal-like sequence and is considerably shorter than the vertebrate proteins at its N terminus (Fig. 2).Figure 2Alignment of human, goose, and worm forms of MCD. The deduced human MCD protein sequence (Hs MCD) is presented on the top line, the goose MCD protein sequence (Aa MCD) is shown in the middle line, and the putative C. elegans MCD protein sequence (Ce MCD) is presented on the bottom line. Two forms of MCD are expressed in goose, a longer form that contains a mitochondrial leader sequence and a shorter cytoplasmic form that starts at position 51 of the mitochondrial precursor but is otherwise identical. The amino acids that are present only in the precursor of the goose mitochondrial MCD are italicized. Note that the human form of MCD corresponds precisely to that of the cytoplasmic form of goose MCD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Additional searches of the human EST data base identified 34 MCD cDNA clones, 4 of which were deposited only recently and contained the entire MCD ORF. However, none were as long as the MCD cDNA described in this report. 5′-RACE also failed to provide evidence for a longer MCD transcript. Knowledge of gene structure can help in the analysis of gene transcripts, and we therefore identified an MCD genomic DNA bacterial artificial chromosome clone. A fragment of this clone that hybridized to the 5′ end of the MCD cDNA clone was obtained, and sequence analysis of this clone revealed the presence of an in-frame ATG just 22-bp upstream of the 5′ end of the MCD cDNA, as well as the absence of splice acceptor sites between this ATG and the ATG we designated as the beginning of the MCD open reading frame (Fig. 3). Any transcripts originating upstream of this ATG would have the potential to encode a longer form of human MCD, and we used PCR techniques to search for such transcripts. We prepared first strand MCD cDNA from human fibroblast mRNA and used this as template in PCR reactions containing either of two antisense MCD oligonucleotides (MCD-RACE.1 and MCD-RACE.2) and the MCD-hypoATG oligonucleotide, which spans this hypothetical upstream ATG. No detectable products were generated from these reactions even though (a) these same two combinations of primers amplified a fragment of the correct size from MCD genomic DNA and (b) the same cDNA sample and antisense oligonucleotides could be used to amplify a fragment of the correct size in PCR reactions using a 5′ primer (MCDstart), which spanned the ATG that we list at position +1 of the cDNA sequence. Similar results were obtained when these various primer pairs were used with human heart cDNA as the template. Given the sensitivity of PCR detection techniques, these data indicate that MCD transcripts containing the hypothetical upstream ATG are either of very low abundance or do not exist, at least in human fibroblasts and heart tissue. Although we find no evidence for MCD transcripts that contain the hypothetical upstream ATG, it is useful to consider whether an mRNA that contained this sequence would encode a protein analogous to goose mitochondrial MCD. We think that this is unlikely for two reasons. First, this putative upstream ATG is followed by a pyrimidine (Fig. 3), which lessens the probability that it would serve as an efficient initiator codon were it present in a mammalian mRNA (the +4 position is almost always a purine in highly expressed transcripts (25Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 26Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar)). Even more importantly, the region between the hypothetical upstream ATG and the ATG at position +1 of the cDNA clone encodes a peptide sequence that lacks features of a mitochondrial leader sequence and shares only slight similarity to the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal of goose mitochondrial MCD. As an independent test of whether the cDNA reported here is capable of encoding the full-length MCD protein we compared the mobility of endogenously synthesized MCD with that of MCD synthesized in vitro from the MCD cDNA clone. Affinity purified anti-MCD antibodies were generated and tested by immunoblot analysis of total cellular protein extracts from human fibroblasts and human hepatoblastoma cells. These antibodies detected a single polypeptide of approximately 50 kDa in both cell types (Fig.4 A), indicating that they are specific for MCD. We then synthesized MCD in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate and used immunoblot analysis to compare its mobility with that of endogenously synthesized human fibroblast MCD. A single protein was detected in each sample and their mobilities were indistinguishable from one another (Fig. 4 B). Control experiments confirmed that the level of rabbit MCD present in the in vitro translation lysates was below the limit of detection. Taken together, these various lines of evidence suggest that the MCD present in human fibroblasts corresponds to the product of the MCD cDNA clone. To test the hypothesis that the gene we had identified encoded human malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, we expressed the entire human MCD protein in bacteria as a fusion with MBP. The recombinant MBP-MCD fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on an amylose resin. Assessment of MBP-MCD purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a predominant band at 90 kDa (Fig. 5), the size predicted for a fusion containing MBP (42 kDa) and human MCD (46 kDa). Purified recombinant MBP-MCD and purified MBP-LacZ (expressed and purified by the identical protocol and from the same strain of E. coli) were assayed for their ability to convert malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA. MBP-MCD showed significant malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity, with a specific activity of 3 units/mg and a Km of 220 μm for malonyl-CoA (Fig. 5). The MBP-LacZ protein lacked activity altogether, demonstrating that the activity of the MBP-MCD fusion protein was intrinsic to the portion derived from MCD and that E. coli MCD does not co-purify with MBP fusion proteins on amylose resin. Although human MCD displayed a high Km for malonyl-CoA, it is only slightly higher than the Km of the goose e"
https://openalex.org/W2168058720,"The in vivo formation of disulfide bonds, which is critical for the stability and/or activity of many proteins, is catalyzed by thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases. In the present studies, we show that the Gram-positive eubacterium Bacillus subtilis contains three genes, denoted bdbA, bdbB, and bdbC, for thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases. Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, containing two disulfide bonds, was unstable when secreted by B. subtilis cells lacking BdbB or BdbC, and notably, the expression levels of bdbB and bdbC appeared to set a limit for the secretion of active alkaline phosphatase. Cells lacking BdbC also showed decreased stability of cell-associated forms of E. coli TEM-β-lactamase, containing one disulfide bond. In contrast, BdbA was not required for the stability of alkaline phosphatase or β-lactamase. Because BdbB and BdbC are typical membrane proteins, our findings suggest that they promote protein folding at the membrane-cell wall interface. Interestingly, pre-β-lactamase processing to its mature form was stimulated in cells lacking BdbC, suggesting that the unfolded form of this precursor is a preferred substrate for signal peptidase. Surprisingly, cells lacking BdbC did not develop competence for DNA uptake, indicating the involvement of disulfide bond-containing proteins in this process. Unlike E. coli and yeast, none of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases of B. subtilis was required for growth in the presence of reducing agents. In conclusion, our observations indicate that BdbB and BdbC have a general role in disulfide bond formation, whereas BdbA may be dedicated to a specific process."

Recombinant hCNT1 and rCNT1 produced in oocytes mediate saturable Na+-dependent transport of uridine (apparent Km 40 μm), with a Na+/uridine coupling stoichiometry of 1:1. Transport is inhibited by pyrimidine nucleosides (thymidine and cytidine) and adenosine but not by guanosine or inosine (8Huang Q.Q. Yao S.Y.M. Ritzel M.W.L. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J.

Ritzel M.W.L. Gati W.P. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1529-1535PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleoside specificity of hCNT2 and rCNT2 is complementary to that of h/rCNT1, showing a preference for adenosine, other purine nucleosides, and uridine (10Yao S.Y.M. Ng A.M.L. Ritzel M.W.L.

Thus, “purine nucleoside-selective” CNT2 shows a greater tolerance for uridine as a permeant than does “pyrimidine nucleoside-selective” CNT1 for adenosine. The difference in substrate specificity between CNT1 and CNT2 is reflected in their capabilities to transport different pyrimidine and purine antiviral and anticancer nucleoside drugs. For example, h/rCNT1 transport 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine(zidovudine) and ddC, but not ddI, whereas hCNT2 transports only ddI (8Huang Q.Q. Yao S.Y.M. Ritzel M.W.L. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E.

Gemcitabine, an anticancer cytidine analog, is a good hCNT1 permeant but is not transported by hCNT2 (22Mackey J.R. Mani R.S. Selner M. Molwes D. Young J.D. Belt J.A. Crawford C.R. Cass C.E.

Recent chimeric studies between the CNT1 and CNT2 proteins of rat have identified TMs 7 and 8 as potential determinants of substrate selectivity (23Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28845-28848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). When a point mutation (S318G) was introduced into TM 7 of rat CNT1, it was converted from being pyrimidine nucleoside-selective into an apparently broad specificity transporter (24Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2298-2302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here, we present a comprehensive and independent study of the structural features responsible for the substrate specificities of the human CNT1 and CNT2 proteins, focusing not only on TM 7 but also TM 8 and combinations thereof. We have used information derived from chimeric constructs between hCNT1 and hCNT2, sequence comparisons between mammalian CNTs and the hagfish cib transporter (hfCNT) (which is broadly selective for both pyrimidine and purine nucleosides), and site-directed mutagenesis to identify two sets of adjacent residues in TMs 7 and 8 (including the human counterpart of rCNT1 Ser318) that, when converted to the corresponding residues in hCNT2, dramatically alter the substrate selectivity of hCNT1. We report that mutation of the two adjacent residues in TM 7 alone convert hCNT1 into a protein with cib-like activity. We also show that the concurrent mutation of two adjacent residues in TM 8 convert the latter protein with cib-type characteristics into one with purine nucleoside-selective, cif-like characteristics. Mutations in TM 8 of hCNT1 alone produced a novel uridine-selective transport phenotype. Molecular modeling studies have identified possible roles for each of the four identified hCNT1 residues. Chimeras between hCNT1 and hCNT2 were created using the three junction points (arrows A, B, and C) illustrated in Fig. 1. A four-character numerical nomenclature was chosen to represent each chimera. The numbers 1 and 2 in the name indicate the approximate percentage of each wild-type cDNA in a particular construct, where “1” represents the DNA and encoded amino acid sequence of hCNT1 and “2” denotes that of hCNT2. For instance, C2211 is a 50:50 chimeric transporter whose amino-terminal half is hCNT2 and whose carboxyl-terminal half is hCNT1; C2221 is a 75:25 chimeric transporter whose amino-terminal three-quarters is hCNT2 and whose carboxyl-terminal one-quarter is hCNT1. hCNT1 and hCNT2 cDNAs (GenBankTM accession numbersAF036109 and HSU62968) used to construct the chimeras were cloned in this laboratory as described previously (11Ritzel M.W.L.

All chimeras were produced in two steps by the overlap extension polymerase chain reaction method (25Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar) using high fidelity Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase. All chimeras were sequenced in both directions to ensure that the correct splice sites had been introduced. Sequence comparisons between the TM 7–9 regions of h/rCNT1 (cit), hfCNT (cib), and h/rCNT2 (cif) were used to identify residue differences between the cit, cib, and cif transport proteins (Fig. 4). The nine residues of hCNT1 selected for mutagenesis are shown by arrows as follows: three in TM 7, five in TM 8, and one in TM 9. In each case the residue in hCNT1 was converted to the corresponding residue at that position in hCNT2 and are designated M1–M9 (Table I). For example, mutant M1 has the single substitution S311A, whereas M1/2/3 is a combination mutant with three substitutions in TM 7 corresponding to S311A, S319G, and Q320M. All hCNT1 point mutations were produced in two steps by a modified overlap extension polymerase chain reaction method (26Ho S.M. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

Two approaches were used to predict the location of buried and lipid-accessible residues: the identification of TM positions able to accommodate polar residues and the identification of positions of restricted variability. Residues at these locations would be predicted to be buried within the bundle of TMs, either forming helix-helix contacts or lining the substrate translocation pathway. Conversely, positions of high variability, and where polar residues are never found, might be predicted to be exposed to the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. Polar residues that would not be expected to be in contact with the lipid acyl chains were defined as charged residues and those capable of forming more than one hydrogen bond. Because of their potential involvement in substrate recognition, serine and threonine were included in the category of polar residues, although their side chains can hydrogen bond to the main chain of an α-helix and so can be on its lipid-facing surface. Non-polar residues, which could be in contact with the lipid acyl chains, were defined as those normally classed as hydrophobic, but also include tyrosine, which has been found on the lipid-facing surface of TMs in other membrane proteins including bacteriorhodopsin (27Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). hCNT1 (650 residues) and hCNT2 (658 residues) belong to different CNT sub-families and exhibit strongest residue similarity within TMs of the carboxyl-terminal halves of the proteins (Fig.1). Functionally, hCNT1 and hCNT2 display cit- and cif-type Na+-dependent nucleoside transport activities (11Ritzel M.W.L. Yao S.Y.M. Huang M.Y. Elliot J.F. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Am. J.

Therefore, although both hCNT1 and hCNT2 transport uridine, they are otherwise selective for pyrimidine (hCNT1) and purine (hCNT2) nucleosides (except for modest transport of adenosine by hCNT1). Below, we describe a series of chimeric and site-directed mutagenesis experiments aimed at identifying hCNT1/2 domains and amino acid residues responsible for the marked differences in permeant selectivity between the two transporters. Splice sites between hCNT1 and hCNT2 were engineered at the beginning or end of putative extramembranous domains as predicted by the topology model in Fig. 1, thereby minimizing disruption of native TMs and loops. To increase further the probability of obtaining functional hCNT1/2 chimeras, we concealed splice sites within regions of identical amino acid sequence in the two proteins. These splice sites divided the proteins into four unequal quarters ranging from 85 to 261 residues, each containing 2–4 TMs (Fig. 1). RNA transcripts for each chimeric cDNA were synthesized by in vitro transcription and were microinjected into Xenopus oocytes, which were then assayed for (i) functionality (using uridine as a universal hCNT1/2 permeant) and (ii) substrate selectivity (using thymidine and inosine as diagnostic hCNT1 and hCNT2 permeants, respectively). Shown in Fig. 2 is a representative transport experiment for the two wild-type transporters hCNT1 and hCNT2 and for chimeras C2211, C2221, C1221, and C1121 (where 1 is the hCNT1 sequence and 2 is the hCNT2 sequence). The first in the series, C2211, was a 50:50 chimera incorporating the amino-terminal half (TMs 1–6) of hCNT2 and the carboxyl-terminal half (TMs 7–13) of hCNT1. Functionally, C2211 exhibited pyrimidine nucleoside-selective characteristics similar to hCNT1 (marked thymidine uptake and low inosine transport), indicating that the regions conferring substrate selectivity were located largely within the carboxyl-terminal half of the transporter. The second chimera, C2221, increased the hCNT2 portion of the transporter by 3 TMs, leaving the 4 remaining TMs at the carboxyl terminus as hCNT1. This 75:25 hCNT2/hCNT1 construct displayed inosine and thymidine transport characteristics similar to hCNT2, implicating residues 303–387 (incorporating TMs 7–9) as the determinant of substrate specificity. The hCNT2-like transport profile of chimera C1221 (incorporating the middle 5 TMs of hCNT2 (TMs 5–9) into hCNT1) was consistent with this conclusion. Chimera C1121 (incorporating only residues 303–387 of hCNT2 into hCNT1) directly confirmed involvement of the TM 7–9 region by also exhibiting hCNT2-like transport properties. Although these studies implicated TMs 7–9 as the primary region responsible for substrate specificity, the finding that chimeras C2221, C1221, and C1121 showed modestly increased uptake of thymidine relative to wild-type hCNT2 (Fig. 2) suggested secondary involvement of other regions of the protein. Similarly, Fig. 2 shows that chimera C2211 exhibited significantly increased uptake of inosine relative to wild-type hCNT1. The chimeras transported uridine to similar extents as hCNT1 and hCNT2, suggesting that the native conformations were retained in all constructs. Complementary reciprocal chimeras were also prepared (C1122, C1112, C2112, and C2212). C1122 displayed low uridine transport but maintained purine nucleoside selectivity with an ∼5-fold increase in inosine uptake compared with water-injected oocytes (2.02 ± 0.63 pmol/oocyte·30 min−1 versus 0.42 ± 0.04 pmol/oocyte·30 min−1) and no detectable thymidine transport. The other chimeras were non-functional, perhaps because of altered helical packing or improper plasma membrane targeting. A structural feature shared by these chimeras (and by low activity C1122) was the presence of hCNT2 sequence at the carboxyl terminus. As shown in Fig. 3, the cif-like transport characteristics of chimera C1121 was confirmed by testing the transportability of a panel of six physiological purine and pyrimidine nucleosides (adenosine, uridine, inosine, thymidine, guanosine, and cytidine). Fluxes were similar in profile and magnitude to those exhibited by wild-type hCNT2 (adenosine, uridine, inosine, guanosine ≫ thymidine, cytidine). Furthermore, uridine uptake was strongly Na+-dependent, providing additional evidence that the native conformation of the transporter had been retained. Our analysis of hCNT1/hCNT2 chimeras located an 85-residue segment in the carboxyl-terminal half of hCNT1 (residues 303–387) that when substituted by corresponding hCNT2 sequence resulted in a purine nucleoside-selective transporter. hCNT1 and hCNT2 are 80% identical and 85% similar within this region. When aligned with rCNT1 and rCNT2, which are functionally similar to their human counterparts, there is 98% ident"

Originally studied in the nervous system, L1 is expressed by hematopoietic and many epithelial cells, suggesting a more expanded role. L1 supports homophilic L1-L1 and integrin-mediated cell binding and can also bind with high affinity to the neural proteoglycan neurocan; however, the binding site is unknown. We have dissected the L1 molecule and investigated the cell binding ability of Ig domains 1 and 6. We report that RGD sites in domain 6 support α5β1- or αvβ3-mediated integrin binding and that both RGD sites are essential. Cooperation of RGD sites with neighboring domains are necessary for α5β1. A T cell hybridoma and activated T cells could bind to L1 in the absence of RGDs. This binding was supported by Ig domain 1 and mediated by cell surface-exposed neurocan. Lymphoid and brain-derived neurocan were structurally similar. We also present evidence that a fusion protein of the Ig 1-like domain of L1 can bind to recombinant neurocan. Our results support the notion that L1 provides distinct cell binding sites that may serve in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions."

First, they are required for protein targeting to and translocation across membranes, such as the eubacterial plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticular membrane of eukaryotes (for reviews, see Refs. 1von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 2Wickner W. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev.

Second, in addition to their role as determinants for protein targeting and translocation, certain signal peptides have a signaling function. In eukaryotes, signal peptide fragments were shown to be involved in antigen presentation through interaction with the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (5Braud V.M. Allan D.S.J. O'Callaghan C.A. Söderström K. D'Andrea A. Ogg G.S. Lazatic S. Young N.T. Bell J.I. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. McMichael A.J.

More recently, it was suggested that fragments of signal peptides of certain cellular and viral proteins interact with cytosolic target molecules. For example, it was shown that signal peptide fragments of preprolactin and human immunodeficiency virus-1 p-gp160 interact in the cytosol with calmodulin (9Martoglio B. Graf R. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6636-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In particular the fact that signal peptide fragments are involved in signaling underscores the importance of the proteases involved in signal peptide processing and degradation. During or shortly after pre-protein translocation, the signal peptide is removed by signal peptidases, which is a prerequisite for the release of secretory proteins from the trans side of the membrane and, in some cases, the post-translational modification of its amino terminus (for reviews, see Refs. 10Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Signal Peptidases. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 5-15Google Scholar, 11Lory S. von Heijne G. Signal Peptidases. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 31-48Google Scholar, 12Sankaran K.

Proteases, which determine the subsequent fate of cleaved signal peptides were, thus far, only characterized in Escherichia coli. In this organism, the signal peptide of the major lipoprotein (Lpp; also known as Braun's lipoprotein) was shown to be cleaved by signal peptide peptidase (SppA, also known as protease IV), which is an integral membrane protein (14Hussain M. Ozawa Y. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Ichihara S. Beppu N. Mizushima S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 9405-9411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting signal peptide fragments were subsequently degraded in the cytoplasm by the oligopeptidase A (OpdA; Refs. 17Novak P. Ray P.H. Dev I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 420-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 18Novak P. Dev I.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5067-5075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, as evidenced by the degradation of signal peptides in a strain lacking SppA other, as yet unidentified, proteases appeared to be involved in this process (19Suzuki T. Itoh A. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2523-2528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even though homologues of E. coli SppA have been identified in eubacteria and archaea, and homologues of E. coli OpdA in eubacteria, the involvement of none of these enzymes in protein secretion has been documented. In the present studies, we have investigated the role of two SppA-like proteins of the Gram-positive eubacterium Bacillus subtilis in protein secretion. B. subtilis is a particularly suitable organism for this purpose, because its capacity for protein secretion can be probed under conditions of hyper-production of secretory pre-proteins (20Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2333-2344PubMed Google Scholar). The results of our studies show that the absence of B. subtilis SppA results in slower processing of secretory pre-proteins without significantly affecting their membrane translocation. In contrast, a second SppA-like protein of B. subtilis, denoted TepA , is required for efficient pre-protein translocation across the membrane. Interestingly, TepA seems to be a cytosolic protein, showing sequence similarity to the cytosolic protease ClpP. Table I lists the plasmids and bacterial strains used.

Due to the large difference in the length of the amino-terminal domains of SppA (E. coli) and SppA (B. subtilis), these domains did not align properly. Therefore, the first 35 residues of SppA of B. subtilis were aligned manually. The RDF2 program (25Pearson W.R.

Sequence comparisons revealed that the yteI gene, located at 258o on the B. subtilis chromosome, specifies a protein of 335 residues (calculated molecular mass of 36,515) with significant sequence similarity to the SppA protein of E. coli (49% identical residues and conservative replacements; Fig. 1). The significance of this similarity was statistically confirmed with the RDF2 program, showing that the z value of the alignment was 30.8. Therefore, we renamed the yteI gene sppA. In addition, the ymfB gene, located at 149.5o on the B. subtilis chromosome, was also shown to specify a protein with sequence similarity to SppA of E. coli (41% identical residues and conservative replacements; Fig. 1). Even though the YmfB protein showed a lower degree of similarity to SppA of E. coli than SppA of B. subtilis, the z value of the alignment between YmfB and E. coli SppA was 6.6, confirming its statistical significance. As the YmfB protein (223 residues; calculated molecular mass of 24,245) turned out to be important for efficient precursor translocation across the membrane (see below), we renamed the YmfB protein TepA (Translocation-enhancing protein). Interestingly, TepA also shows sequence similarity to the known ClpP proteases of E. coli and other organisms, but the similarity between these proteins is limited to four domains, numbered I–IV (Fig.2). These domains include the conserved residues serine 111 (domain II), histidine 135 (domain III), and aspartic acid 185 (domain IV), which form the active site of ClpP of E. coli (29Wang J.

In the first strain, denoted B. subtilis ΔsppA, the coding sequence of the sppA gene was disrupted by the integrated pMutin2 (Fig. 3 A). In the second strain, denoted B. subtilis I tepA, the coding sequence of the tepA gene was left intact, but the tepA promoter was replaced with the IPTG-dependent Pspac promoter, present on the integrated pMutin2 (Fig. 3 B). Irrespective of the growth medium used or the presence of IPTG, B. subtilisΔsppA and B. subtilis I tepA showed growth rates comparable to that of the parental strain B. subtilis 168, demonstrating that both SppA and TepA were not essential for growth and viability of the cells, at least under the conditions used. Furthermore, neither SppA nor TepA was required for the development of competence for DNA binding and uptake or sporulation (data not shown). To test whether SppA or TepA are important for the processing of secretory proteins, the processing kinetics of two secretory pre-proteins were studied by pulse-chase labeling experiments. First, B. subtilis ΔsppA and I tepA were transformed with plasmid pKTH10, which results in the hyper-production and hyper-secretion of the α-amylase AmyQ from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (≈1–3 g/liter; Refs. 20Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2333-2344PubMed Google Scholar and 30Palva I. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). As a control, a strain was used in which the yhcT gene was disrupted with pMutin2. This strain, denoted B. subtilisΔyhcT, was neither affected in growth nor in the secretion of various proteins (data not shown). As shown in Fig.4, compared with B. subtilisΔyhcT, processing of pre-AmyQ was affected both in B. subtilis I tepA and ΔsppA. The strongest effect was observed in cells depleted of TepA; after a chase of 30 s, ≈12% of the labeled AmyQ was mature in B. subtilis I tepA, whereas under the same conditions, ≈61% of the labeled AmyQ was mature in the control strain ΔyhcT. When B. subtilis I tepA was grown in the presence of IPTG, the rate of processing was strongly stimulated, but not completely to wild-type levels. In cells of B. subtilis ΔsppA processing of pre-AmyQ was affected to a much lesser extent (Fig. 4); after 30 s of chase, ≈40% of the labeled AmyQ was mature, which is significantly less than the ≈61% mature AmyQ observed for the control strain. The latter effect of the ΔsppA mutation was observed irrespective of the absence or presence of IPTG (data not shown). Taken together, these findings show that SppA and TepA are required for efficient processing of pre-AmyQ. Similar to pre-AmyQ, TepA depletion resulted in significantly reduced rates of processing of pre-OmpA from E. coli, as demonstrated with cells of B. subtilis I tepA transformed with plasmid pJM100 carrying the ompA gene. In addition, the appearance of two stable OmpA degradation products of 16 and 18 kDa, respectively, which are probably formed in the cell wall (31Meens J. Herbort M. Klein M. Freudl R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was strongly affected in TepA-depleted cells (Fig.5); ≈95% of the labeled OmpA was still in the precursor form after a chase of 1 min, whereas under the same conditions, ≈60% of the labeled OmpA was in the precursor form in the control strain. Pre-OmpA processing in B. subtilis I tepA (pJM100) was restored to wild-type levels when the cells were grown in the presence of IPTG. Notably, processing of pre-OmpA was not affected in cells of B. subtilisΔsppA (data not shown), indicating that TepA is more important for efficient precursor processing than SppA. To investigate whether the decreased rates of processing of pre-AmyQ in B. subtilis I tepA and ΔsppA would also result in the accumulation of this precursor protein in the cells, Western blotting experiments were performed. As shown in Fig.6 A, only cells depleted of TepA accumulated pre-AmyQ. Upon addition of IPTG to the growth medium, the accumulation of pre-AmyQ in B. subtilis I tepA was reduced to levels comparable with pre-AmyQ levels in the control strain ΔyhcT. In B. subtilis ΔsppA no accumulation of pre-AmyQ was observed (data not shown). Even though processing of pre-AmyQ was slowed down in TepA-depleted cells, no effect was observed on the amounts of mature AmyQ accumulating in the medium (data not shown). The membrane-associated lipoprotein PrsA is a folding catalyst, which is required for the folding of mature AmyQ to a protease-resistant conformation at the extra-cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Consequently, prsA mutations result in significantly reduced amounts of cell-associated and secreted mature AmyQ, but they do not result in the accumulation of pre-AmyQ in the cell (32Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 33Jacobs M. Andersen J.B. Kontinen V. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 957-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As a first approach to identify the stage in the secretion pathway in which TepA is involved, we investigated whether TepA is active before or after PrsA. To this purpose, the accumulation of pre-AmyQ was examined in a tepA-prsA3 double mutant strain. Like the tepA single mutant, the tepA-prsA3 double mutant strain accumulated pre-AmyQ in the absence of IPTG (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, irrespective of the presence or absence of IPTG, strongly reduced levels of mature AmyQ were detectable in cells of the tepA-prsA3 double mutant strain, similar to the yhcT-prsA3 control strain. Consistent with these observations, in the absence of IPTG, 30–40% reduced levels of AmyQ activity were observed in the growth medium of the tepA-prsA3 mutant strain as compared with the yhcT-prsA3 control strain (data not shown). Taken together, these observations showed that TepA acts at an earlier stage in the secretion of pre-AmyQ than PrsA, presumably before or during translocation of pre-AmyQ across the membrane. To test whether TepA is required for efficient translocation of pre-AmyQ across the membrane, B. subtilis I tepA was transformed with plasmid pKTH10-BT (34Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This plasmid specifies a hybrid AmyQ protein containing the biotin-accepting domain (PSBT) of a transcarboxylase from Propionibacterium shermannii (35Jander G. Cronan Jr., J.E. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3049-3058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) fused to its carboxyl terminus. The rationale of this experiment is that pre-AmyQ-PSBT will only be biotinylated by the cytoplasmic biotin ligase if the rate of translocation of pre-AmyQ-PSBT is slowed down to such an extent that the PSBT domain can fold into its native three-dimensional structure and accept biotin before transport across the membrane. As shown in Fig. 7(A and B), cells depleted of TepA accumulated biotinylated pre-AmyQ-PSBT, whereas no biotinylated (pre-) AmyQ-PSBT was detected in cells of the parental strain B. subtilis 168 transformed with pKTH10-BT. Very similar results were obtained using a strain with a disrupted secDF gene (Fig. 7, C and D), which encodes a non-essential component of the pre-protein translocase complex (36Bolhuis A. Broekhuizen C.P. Sorokin A. van Roosmalen M.L. Venema G. Bron S. Quax W.J. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21217-21224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). When cells of B. subtilis I tepA were grown in the presence of IPTG, low levels of biotinylated pre-AmyQ-PSBT were observed. In conclusion, these data show that, similar to SecDF (36Bolhuis A. Broekhuizen C.P. Sorokin A. van Roosmalen M.L. Venema G. Bron S. Quax W.J. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21217-21224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), TepA is required for the efficient translocation of pre-AmyQ across the membrane. In contrast, no accumulation of (biotinylated) pre-AmyQ-PSBT could be observed in B. subtilis ΔsppA (data not shown), which is consistent with the relatively mild effects of the sppA gene disruption on pre-protein processing as described above. SppA of E. coli is a membrane protein (16Ichihara S. Suzuki T. Suzuki M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986;"

Determination of the amino acid sequence of the N terminus of the cleavage products show that the pH-sensitive cleavage site of NhaA, both in isolated everted membrane vesicles as well as in the pure protein in detergent, is Lys-249 in loop VIII–IX, which connects transmembrane segment VIII to IX. Interestingly, the two polypeptide products of the split antiporter remain complexed and co-purify on Ni2+-NTA column. Loop VIII–IX has also been found to play a role in the pH regulation of NhaA; three mutations introduced into the loop shift the pH profile of the Na+/H+ antiporter activity as measured in everted membrane vesicles. An insertion mutation introducing Ile-Glu-Gly between residues Lys-249 and Arg-250 (K249-IEG-R250) and Cys replacement of either Val-254 (V254C) or Glu-241 (E241C) cause acidic shift of the pH profile of the antiporter by 0.5, 1, and 0.3 pH units, respectively. Interestingly, the double mutant E241C/V254C introduces a basic shift of more than 1 pH unit with respect to the single mutation V254C. Taken together these results imply the involvement of loop VIII–IX in the pH-induced conformational change, which leads to activation of NhaA at alkaline pH."

This study compared the effect of these stimuli on endogenous IκB kinase (IKK) signalsome activation and IκB phosphorylation/proteolysis in human monocytic cells and investigated the role of the signalsome proteins IKK-α, IKK-β, NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), IKK-γ (NF-κB essential modulator), and IKK complex-associated protein. Kinase assays showed that TNF elicited a rapid but short-lived induction of IKK activity with a 3-fold greater effect on IKK-α than on IKK-β, peaking at 5 min. In contrast, LPS predominantly stimulated IKK-β activity, which slowly increased, peaking at 30 min. A second peak was observed at a later time point following LPS stimulation, which consisted of both IKK-α and -β activity. The endogenous levels of the signalsome components were unaffected by stimulation. Furthermore, our studies showed association of the IKK-α/β heterodimer with NIK, IκB-α and -e in unstimulated cells. Exposure to LPS or TNF led to differential patterns of IκB-α and IκB-e disappearance from and reassembly with the signalsome, whereas IKK-α, IKK-β, and NIK remained complex-associated. NIK cannot phosphorylate IκB-α directly, but it appears to be a functionally important subunit, because mutated NIK inhibited stimulus-induced κB-dependent transcription more effectively than mutated IKK-α or -β. Overexpression of IKK complex-associated protein inhibited stimulus-mediated transcription, whereas NF-κB essential modulator enhanced it. The understanding of LPS- and TNF-induced signaling may allow the development of specific strategies to treat sepsis-associated disease."

The activities of these two enzymes change in a converse manner during fasting and refeeding or during insulin deficiency and insulin treatment. Fasting and insulin deficiency are associated with inhibition of glucokinase transcription and with a gradual decline in total glucokinase activity, whereas refeeding or insulin treatment restores glucokinase activity by induction of glucokinase transcription (4Iyndejian P.B.

In addition to changes in total enzyme concentration by regulation of gene transcription, glucokinase activity is also regulated acutely by a translocation mechanism (8Agius L. Peak M. Biochem.

A rise in extracellular glucose or low concentrations of fructose or sorbitol cause the rapid dissociation of glucokinase from its regulatory protein and the translocation of the enzyme to the cytoplasm. This translocation mechanism results in a large increase in glucokinase activity in the cytoplasm within minutes of a rise in extracellular glucose concentration (8Agius L. Peak M. Biochem.

The binding properties of glucokinase to its 68-kDa regulatory protein have been extensively characterized from studies on the purified proteins (11Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J.

Binding of glucokinase to the regulatory protein is enhanced by fructose 6-phosphate, and this effect is antagonized by fructose 1-phosphate. Both ligands bind to the same site on the regulatory protein and alter its affinity for glucokinase. It has been proposed that the rise in fructose 6-phosphate in hepatocytes during active glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis causes increased binding of glucokinase to the regulatory protein and decreased glucose phosphorylation (15Van Schaftingen E. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Niculescu L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Van Schaftingen E. Biochem.

Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), whereas the increase in fructose 1-phosphate that results from metabolism of fructose or sorbitol causes dissociation of glucokinase from the regulatory protein (9Agius L.

Although the role of fructose 1-phosphate in explaining the translocation of glucokinase by fructose and sorbitol is now firmly established (18Niculescu L. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E.

Adenovirus-mediated glucose-6-phosphatase overexpression markedly suppresses the hepatocyte glucose 6-phosphate content (20Seoane J. Trinh K. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Foix A.M. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26972-26977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and thereby fructose 6-phosphate which is in equilibrium with glucose 6-phosphate (16Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and thus provides a powerful tool to unequivocally test the physiological role of changes in hexose 6-phosphate in the intact cell.In order to evaluate the regulatory function of glucose-6-phosphatase in the hepatocyte, this study had three aims. The first was to determine the role of changes in hepatocyte hexose 6-phosphate content in regulating glucokinase translocation. The second was to determine the control strengths (control coefficients) of glucose-6-phosphatase and glucokinase on glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. The third was to determine whether glucose-6-phosphatase overexpression alters the control strength of glucokinase on glycolysis or glycogen synthesis or the response coefficients of these pathways to glucose in the hepatocyte. The results support a hypothesis that the primary regulatory function of glucose-6-phosphatase in the hepatocyte is to buffer the glucose 6-phosphate concentration. This hypothesis is consistent with recent apparently paradoxical findings on glucose-6-phosphatase activity in experimental and pathological states.DISCUSSIONGlucokinase (hexokinase IV) differs from the other hexokinase isoenzymes (I–III) in that it is not inhibited by physiological concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate, the product of the reaction (4Iyndejian P.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Since binding of purified glucokinase to the regulatory (inhibitory) protein is enhanced by fructose 6-phosphate (11Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 13Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that fructose 6-phosphate is a substitute for end product inhibition by glucose 6-phosphate because fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate are maintained in equilibrium by phosphoglucoisomerase (19Agius L. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was tested using mannitol which is metabolized by hepatocytes to mannitol 1-phosphate (19Agius L. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mannitol was shown to inhibit glucose metabolism and glucokinase translocation. Since mannitol 1-phosphate can act as an analogue of fructose 6-phosphate in promoting binding of glucokinase to the regulatory protein (14Detheux M. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), these findings appeared to support the hypothesis that binding of glucokinase to the regulatory protein in intact hepatocytes is regulated by analogues of fructose 6-phosphate (19Agius L. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the possibility that the inhibitory effect of mannitol on detritiation of glucose was due to other mechanisms could not be rigorously excluded since mannitol 1-phosphate is a potent inhibitor of phosphoglucoisomerase (19Agius L. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Direct evidence in support of regulation of glucokinase translocation in intact hepatocytes by changes in fructose 6-phosphate/glucose 6-phosphate is still lacking.The first aim of this study was to determine whether lowering the hexose 6-phosphate content of hepatocytes by glucose-6-phosphatase overexpression causes dissociation of glucokinase from its regulatory protein as assessed from the distribution of glucokinase between free and bound states and from the response coefficients of glycogen synthesis and glycolysis to glucose. If changes in the hepatocyte hexose 6-phosphate content have a physiological role in regulating the binding of glucokinase to its regulatory protein, then lowering of the hexose 6-phosphate content with glucose-6-phosphatase would be expected to potentiate the translocation of glucokinase in response to glucose or sorbitol and to increase the response coefficient of glycolysis and glycogen synthesis to glucose. Our results demonstrate that lowering of the hepatocyte hexose 6-phosphate content by glucose-6-phosphatase overexpression does not affect glucokinase translocation at any concentration of glucose (5–35 mm) or sorbitol, as determined from the free glucokinase activity that is a measure of the cytoplasmic enzyme (9Agius L. Peak M. Van Schaftingen E Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10Brown K.S. Kalinowski S.S. Megill J.R. Durham S.K. Mookhtiar K.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Consistent with the unchanged cytoplasmic glucokinase activity, no increase in the response coefficients of glycogen synthesis or glycolysis to glucose was noted. The glucose 6-phosphate content of hepatocytes increases more than 2-fold between 5 and 25 mm glucose (19Agius L. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Seoane J.

The translocation of glucokinase by increasing glucose concentration (despite the increase in glucose 6-phosphate/fructose 6-phosphate levels) is explained by the effect of glucose on dissociation of glucokinase from the regulatory protein (19Agius L. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The present finding that lowering the hexose 6-phosphate concentration by glucose-6-phosphatase overexpression (over a range of substrate concentrations) does not cause dissociation of glucokinase from its regulatory protein indicates that physiological changes in hexose 6-phosphate do not regulate glucokinase binding to the regulatory protein by feedback inhibition. It seems likely, therefore, that the regulatory protein is saturated with fructose 6-phosphate under most conditions. These findings support the conclusion that the two main functions of the regulatory protein are for feed-forward activation of glucokinase by glucose and for stimulation of glucose metabolism by precursors of fructose 1-phosphate but not for feedback inhibition by glucose 6-phosphate/fructose 6-phosphate. A major function of the liver is the maintenance of blood glucose homeostasis. Regulation of glucokinase translocation by feed-forward activation by glucose without feedback inhibition by hexose 6-phosphate is consistent with such a function.The second aim of this study was to gain insight into the regulatory function of glucose-6-phosphatase in hepatocytes. The recognition that the rate of glucose phosphorylation in hepatocytes, estimated from the detritiation of [2-3H]glucose, exceeds the rate of glucose metabolism has led to several hypotheses on the possible regulatory function(s) of the glucose/glucose 6-phosphate cycle (32Hue L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1981; 52: 247-331PubMed Google Scholar,33Clark D.G. Rognstad R. Katz J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 54: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Suggested functions of substrate cycles in general include the following: increased sensitivity of regulation; control of the direction of flux at metabolic branchpoints; buffering of metabolite concentrations; balancing ATP production and utilization by regenerating ADP and thermogenesis (31Fell D. Snell K. Understanding the Control of Metabolism. Portland Press Ltd., London1997: 219-225Google Scholar, 33Clark D.G. Rognstad R. Katz J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 54: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To investigate the regulatory function of glucose-6-phosphatase in the hepatocyte, we used metabolic control analysis to determine the control strength of glucose-6-phosphatase on glycogen synthesis and glycolysis, and we determined whether glucose-6-phosphatase overexpression alters the control strength of glucokinase. Metabolic control analysis is a very useful analytical approach to probe the regulatory mechanisms that operate in the intact cell. Kacser and Burns (29Kacser H. Burns J.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1979; 7: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) showed that the rate of flux through a metabolic pathway approximates a hyperbolic function of the activity (or concentration) of constituent enzymes of the pathway. The control coefficient (control strength) of an enzyme is a measure of the sensitivity of pathway flux to changes in the concentration (activity) of the enzyme and can be determined either from the slope of the curve of pathway flux against enzyme concentration multiplied by the scaling factor or from the slope of a double logarithmic plot of flux against enzyme concentration (29Kacser H. Burns J.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1979; 7: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 30Fell D.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Since the relation between flux and enzyme concentration is hyperbolic, the control coefficient of enzymes generally decreases with increasing enzyme concentration. We showed previously (21Agius L. Peak M. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foiz A.M. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30479-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) that glucokinase has a very high control strength on glycogen synthesis, and this is dependent on the glucose concentration. We proposed that the translocation of glucokinase between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is a major contributing factor to the high control strength and accounts for the glucose dependence (28Agius L. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1998; 38: 303-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). At low glucose concentration when glucokinase is sequestered in an inactive state in the nucleus and the activity of cytoplasmic activity is minimal, a small increase in total glucokinase activity by adenovirus-mediated overexpression is associated with a larger fractional increase in cytoplasmic activity (compared with total activity) and accordingly with a large fractional increase in glycogen synthesis (21Agius L. Peak M. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foiz A.M. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30479-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 28Agius L. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1998; 38: 303-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). At higher glucose concentrations when glucokinase is equally distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (or present predominantly in the cytoplasm), an increase in total enzyme activity by overexpression is associated with a similar fractional increase in cytoplasmic activity and, accordingly, with a lower fractional stimulation of glycogen synthesis than at low glucose concentration (28Agius L. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1998; 38: 303-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).The present results show first that glucose-6-phosphatase overexpression inhibits glycogen synthesis and glycolysis from glucose without affecting glucokinase translocation. Second, they show that both glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase have a greater control coefficient (positive and negative, respectively) on glycogen synthesis than on glycolysis. Third, they show that the control coefficient of glucokinase but not that of glucose-6-phosphatase is dependent on glucose concentration. Fourth, they show that the control coefficient of glucokinase on glycogen synthesis is greater than the control coefficient of glucose-6-phosphatase. Finally, glucose-6-phosphatase overexpression does not increase the control coefficient of glucokinase. The latter finding does not support a regulatory role for glucose-6-phosphatase in increasing the sensitivity of regulation of glucose metabolism. The findings that the control coefficient of glucokinase but not that of glucose-6-phosphatase is dependent on glucose concentration and that glucokinase has a greater control coefficient than glucose-6-phosphatase, particularly at low glucose, are consistent with our previous hypothesis that the compartmentation of glucokinase in the hepatocyte is a major contributing factor to both the high control strength at low glucose concentration and to the glucose dependence of the control strength (21Agius L. Peak M. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foiz A.M. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30479-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 28Agius L. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1998; 38: 303-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase have converse effects on the hepatocyte glucose 6-phosphate content (20Seoane J. Trinh K. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Foix A.M. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26972-26977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 34Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The present study shows converse effects on glycolysis and glycogen synthesis with both glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase having a greater control strength on glycogen synthesis than on glycolysis. Based on these findings that overexpression of glucose-6-phosphatase has no effect on glucokinase translocation and that it also does not increase the control strength of glucokinase, we propose that the main regulatory function of glucose-6-phosphatase is to buffer the glucose 6-phosphate concentration in the hepatocyte. It is noteworthy that in the intact cell the buffering role of the glucose-6-phosphatase system would be determined not only by changes in expression of the catalytic subunit of glucose-6-phosphatase but also by the glucose 6-phosphate transporter which determines the kinetics of entry of glucose 6-phosphate into the endoplasmic reticulum.The role of glucose 6-phosphate in regulating both glycolysis and glycogen synthesis in the hepatocyte is well established. Glucose 6-phosphate regulates glycolysis by increasing the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, a potent allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase-1 (35Hers H.-G. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 36Hue L. Rider M.H. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Substrate-induced translocation of glucokinase is associated with a marked increase in glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in hepatocytes, and the latter explains the stimulation of glycolysis by sorbitol (19Agius L. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Agius L. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1998; 38: 303-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Glucose 6-phosphate increases glycogen synthesis both by acting as an allosteric activator of glycogen synthase and by increasing the dephosphorylation state of glycogen synthase by rendering the enzyme a better substrate for synthase phosphatase (37Villar-Palasi C. Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The latter effect has been established from studies demonstrating a correlation between the activation state of glycogen synthase and glucose 6-phosphate in hepatocytes overexpressing glucokinase (34Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).The present hypothesis that the primary regulatory function of glucose-6-phosphatase is to buffer the concentration of glucose 6-phosphate, a pivotal regulator of glycogen synthesis and glycolysis, is consistent with various recent apparently paradoxical findings on glucose-6-phosphatase. First, studies both in vivo (38Massillon D. Barzilai N. Chen W. Hu M. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9871-9874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and in vitro on isolated hepatocytes or hepatoma cell lines (6Lange A.J. Argaud D. El-Maghrabi M.R.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 882-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have shown that high glucose concentrations induce glucose-6-phosphatase gene transcription. If the primary regulatory role of glucose-6-phosphatase in the liver cell were to control gluconeogenesis then induction of transcription by glucose is unexpected. Accordingly, the transcription of hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which unlike glucose-6-phosphatase has an exclusive role in gluconeogenesis, is repressed by glucose metabolism (41Scott D.K. O'Doherty R.M. Stafford J.M. Newgard C.B. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24145-24151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, if the primary regulatory function of glucose-6-phosphatase were to buffer the glucose 6-phosphate concentration then induction by hyperglycemia is not a pathological consequence of uncontrolled diabetes (38Massillon D. Barzilai N. Chen W. Hu M. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9871-9874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) but a compensatory mechanism. We have shown recently that glucose-6-phosphatase overexpression in vivo increases blood glucose levels in the fed state and when fasted rats are challenged with an oral glucose tolerance test but paradoxically not in the fasted state (42Trinh K.Y. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31615-31620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This finding can also be explained by the primary regulatory role of glucose-6-phosphatase in buffering glucose 6-phosphate levels in the absorptive state when glucokinase is in the cytoplasmic compartment. Glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis are the two sources of glucose 6-phosphate for hepatic glucose production during fasting. The rate of glycogenolysis is determined by the activity of phosphorylase. The regulation of gluconeogenesis has been extensively studied by Groen and co-workers (43Groen A.K. van Roermund C.W.T. Vervoorn R.C. Tager J.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) who determined the control coefficients of the gluconeogenic enzymes in hepatocytes from starved rats and demonstrated the importance of regulation at pyruvate kinase and pyruvate carboxylase. The flux control coefficient of glucose-6-phosphatase on gluconeogenesis was found to be remarkably low (∼0.02), and the glucose 6-phosphate concentration was far below the Km (43Groen A.K. van Roermund C.W.T. Vervoorn R.C. Tager J.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Accordingly the “flux-generating steps” of hepatic glucose production are phosphorylase and pyruvate metabolism at the phosphoenolpyruvate branchpoint. This would explain why glucose-6-phosphatase overexpression does not elevate fasting glycemia (42Trinh K.Y. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31615-31620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It does, however, markedly elevate glucose levels in the fed state and particularly the response to an oral glucose tolerance test (42Trinh K.Y. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31615-31620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), consistent with the present hypothesis of a role of glucose-6-phosphatase in buffering the glucose 6-pho"

The specific receptor for LIF, gp190, binds this cytokine with low affinity and is also required for signal transduction. We have recently reported that glycosylated LIF produced by transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells also binds to a lectin-like receptor, mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (Man-6-P/IGFII-R) (Blanchard, F., Raher, S., Duplomb, L., Vusio, P., Pitard, V., Taupin, J.

The present study shows that (i) mannose 6-phosphate-containing LIF is naturally produced by a number of normal and tumor cell lines; (ii) other cytokines in the interleukin-6 family do not bind to Man-6-P/IGFII-R; and (iii) another unrelated cytokine, macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, is also able to bind to Man-6-P/IGFII-R in a mannose 6-phosphate-sensitive manner. No functional effects or signal transductions mediated by this lectin-like receptor were observed in various biological assays after LIF binding, and mannose 6-phosphate-containing LIF was as active as non-glycosylated LIF. However, mannose 6-phosphate-sensitive LIF binding resulted in rapid internalization and degradation of the cytokine on numerous cell lines, which suggests that Man-6-P/IGFII-R plays an important role in regulating the amounts of LIF available in vivo.

Human LIF contains seven potential N- glycosylation sites (7Moreau J.F. Donaldson D.D. Bennett F. Witek G.J. Clark S.C. Wong G.G. Nature. 1988; 336: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), six of which are functional (8Schmelzer C.H. Harris R.J. Butler D. Yedinak C.M. Wagner K.L. Burton L.E. Arch. Biochem.

In LIF purified from the human HSB2 T lymphoma cell line, N-linked carbohydrates account for about 20 kDa in the molecular mass (43 kDa) of the cytokine (10Gascan H. Godard A. Ferenz C. Naulet J.

Other glycosylated cytokines include macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), stem cell factor (six N- glycosylation sites), IL-9 (four sites), and IL-6 and OSM (two sites), whereas cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-2, IL-11, CNTF, or CT-1 have no N- glycosylation sites.Internalization of LIF and signal transduction are thought to result from LIF binding to the low affinity (nm) LIF receptor (gp190 or LIF-Rβ) and subsequent heterodimerization of gp190 with the gp130 signal transducer (2Jacques Y. Heymann D. Minvielle S. Godard A. Cavaillon J.-M. Les Cytokines. Masson, Paris1996: 349-365Google Scholar). LIF binding to gp190/gp130 induces the activation of receptor-associated Janus kinases, which in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues in both receptor intracellular domains and Janus kinases. This process induces at least two distinct signal transduction pathways as follows: the SHP-2/RAS/MAPK pathway and activation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) STAT3 (2Jacques Y. Heymann D. Minvielle S. Godard A. Cavaillon J.-M. Les Cytokines. Masson, Paris1996: 349-365Google Scholar).We have recently identified a new low affinity LIF receptor that is abundant in numerous cell lines and not related to gp190 (11Blanchard F. Raher S. Duplomb L. Vusio P. Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Moreau J.F. Hoflack B. Minvielle S. Jacques Y. Godard A. J. Biol.

This receptor binds LIF through its carbohydrate moieties and displays biochemical, immunochemical, and functional features indicating that it is identical to the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (Man-6-P/IGFII-R). The extracellular region of Man-6-P/IGFII-R is composed of 15 homologous repeat units with an average length of 147 amino acids (12Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Whereas repeats 1–3 and 7–9 each contain one Man-6-P binding determinant involved in the binding of Man-6-P-containing ligands (lysosomal enzymes, latent TGF-β, proliferin, and LIF) (13Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the binding site of IGF-II has been localized on repeat 11 (14Garmroudi F. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26944-26952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that retinoic acid and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor bind to Man-6-P/IGFII-R at a site or sites different from those involved in Man-6-P or IGF-II binding (15Nykjaer A. Christensen E.I. Vorum H. Hager H. Petersen C.M. Roigaard H. Min H.Y. Vilhardt F. Moller L.B. Kornfeld S. Gliemann J J.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). This receptor is also present at the plasma membrane where it endocytoses secreted lysosomal enzymes, mediates internalization and subsequent degradation of growth factors such as IGF-II (17Kiess W. Blickenstaff G.D. Sklar M.M. Thomas C.L. Nissley S.P. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9339-9344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or proliferin (18Lee S.J. Nathans D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3521-3527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and potentiates the activation of the precursor form of TGF-β (latent TGF-β) into biologically active TGF-β (19Dennis P.A. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Man-6-P/IGFII-R is considered to be a tumor suppressor because of its ability to activate TGF-β (a potent growth inhibitor), promote degradation of the growth factor IGF-II, and regulate localization of lysosomal enzymes implicated in extracellular matrix degradation. Recent findings have shown that Man-6-P/IGFII-R allelic loss is an early event in the etiology of cancer (20Hankins G.R. De S.A. Bentley R.C. Patel M.R. Marks J.R. Iglehart J.D. Jirtle R.L. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2003-2009PubMed Google Scholar) and that TGF-β activation is deficient and IGF-II expression excessive in these Man-6-P/IGFII-R mutant tumors (21Wang S. Souza R.F. Kong D. Yin J. Smolinski K.N. Zou T.T. Frank T. Young J. Flanders K.C. Sugimura H. Abraham J.M. Meltzer S.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2543-2546PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, mouse mutants lacking Man-6-P/IGFII-R are (partly) rescued from perinatal lethality in an IGF-II null background, which indicates the physiological importance of the Man-6-P/IGFII-R turnover mechanism for degradation of IGF-II during embryogenesis (22Filson A.J. Louvi A. Efstratiadis A. Robertson E.J. Development. 1993; 118: 731-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23Ludwig T. Eggenschwiler J. Fisher P. D'Ercole A.J. Davenport M.L. Efstratiadis A. Dev.

Nature. 1987; 329: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) that the Man-6-P receptor and the IGF-II receptor are the same protein suggested that this receptor could function in two diverse biologic processes, i.e. protein trafficking/turnover and transmembrane signaling. However, it has been difficult to establish a role in signal transduction since IGF-II also binds to the IGF-I receptor, a tyrosine kinase receptor that transmits signals across the plasma membrane after IGF-I and IGF-II binding (12Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, many reports have suggested that Man-6-P/IGFII-R may also function as a transmembrane signaling molecule (12Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), although these findings are controversial (25Sakano K. Enjoh T. Numata F. Fujiwara H. Marumoto Y. Higashihashi N. Sato Y.

Hata Y. Ogata E. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12120-12126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or CHO cells (28Pfeifer A. Nurnberg B. Kamm S. Uhde M. Schultz G. Ruth P. Hofmann F. J.

Chem. 1987; 262: 12120-12126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), K562 cells (29Tally M. Li C.H. Hall K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), or OPM2 cells (30Nishiura T. Karasuno T. Yoshida H. Nakao H. Ogawa M. Horikawa Y. Yoshimura M. Okajima Y. Kanakura Y. Kanayama Y. Matsuzawa Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 3546-3554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by IGF-II is mediated by Man-6-P/IGFII-R. A recent report has shown that either proliferin or IGF-II binding to Man-6-P/IGFII-R induces endothelial cell chemotaxis through a G protein-coupled, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent pathway (31Groskopf J.C. Syu L.J. Saltiel A.R. Linzer D.I. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2835-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).In the context of these possible multiple functions for growth factor IGF-II, our studies concerned the role of Man-6-P/IGFII-R in the physiology of the cytokine LIF, i.e. LIF trafficking/turnover and transmembrane signaling. Our results suggest that secretion of Man-6-P-containing LIF is a natural phenomenon in vitro and that other cytokines such as M-CSF can also bind to Man-6-P/IGFII-R. Moreover, LIF, after binding to Man-6-P/IGFII-R, was rapidly internalized and degraded, even though no signal transduction was detected on cells expressing Man-6-P/IGFII-R, but not LIF receptor gp190, and glycosylated LIF had biological activities identical to those of non-glycosylated LIF. It is concluded that LIF (and possibly other cytokines such as M-CSF) is regulated by Man-6-P/IGFII-R in mammalian cells, a situation very similar to that observed with IGF-II.DISCUSSIONOur results showed that all forms of glycosylated natural human LIF (from tumor cell lines or activated lymphocytes) or recombinant human LIF (from CHO and COS cells) bound to Man-6-P/IGFII-R and that other glycosylated cytokines such as M-CSF bound to this receptor in a Man-6-P-sensitive manner. The Man-6-P-containing cytokine LIF was rapidly internalized and degraded by all cells expressing Man-6-P/IGFII-R at the plasma membrane, which suggests that this receptor could be biologically active after LIF binding and implicated in its trafficking/turnover. However, no activation of MAPK or calcium influx and no induction of tyrosine phosphorylation or proliferation were observed after incubation with glycosylated LIF in cells that expressed Man-6-P/IGFII-R but not LIF receptor gp190. Moreover, no difference between glycosylated and non-glycosylated LIF was noted in various LIF biological tests as follows: induction of gp130/gp190 tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of STAT3 and MAPK, induction of proliferation, or induction of haptoglobin secretion by HepG2 cells. In addition, LIF binding to Man-6-P/IGFII-R did not alter IGF-II bioactivity on NIH3T3 fibroblasts (MAPK activation and induction of proliferation).As reported for other secretory Man-6-P-containing ligands such as DNase I (45Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), our results suggest that only a minority of LIF molecules (15–25%), and probably of M-CSF molecules, is phosphorylated on mannose. As the natural forms of LIF studied here bound 4–8-fold less to Man-6-P/IGFII-R, it is likely that non-recombinant LIF in vitro contains less than 5% of Man-6-P. Direct analysis of the phosphorylated oligosaccharides of LIF is needed to provide definitive conclusions. It is noteworthy that phosphorylation of Asn-linked oligosaccharides is mediated by the enzyme N- acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (phosphotransferase), which recognizes a conformation-dependent protein determinant involving specific lysine and arginine residues (45Nishikawa A. Gregory W. Frenz J. Cacia J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19408-19412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 46Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Cygler M. Mort J.S. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21067-21076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although phosphotransferase acts primarily on lysosomal hydrolases, a few secretory glycoproteins such as DNase I acquire Man-6-P moieties. Newly synthesized Man-6-P-containing glycoproteins are then captured in the Golgi apparatus by Man-6-P/IGFII-R or CD-MPR, another Man-6-P receptor (47Dahms N.M. Lobel P. Breitmeyer J. Chirgwin J.M. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1987; 50: 181-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Ligands complexed to MPRs are subsequently translocated via clathrin-coated vesicles (interaction with AP-1 clathrin adapter complex) (48Le Borgne R. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2162-2170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) to endosomes where acidic pH induces a dissociation between the ligand and MPRs. The ligand is then packaged into lysosomes, and the receptor can return to the Golgi apparatus for another cycle (12Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 49Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). As LIF, like DNase I, would appear to be a relatively weak substrate for phosphotransferase, oligosaccharides in most of the molecules are not (or poorly) phosphorylated. Therefore, most of the newly synthesized LIF is secreted rather than being captured in the Golgi apparatus by MPRs. In culture, a weak base such as chloroquine induces enhanced secretion of Man-6-P-containing proteins. In the case of A375 cells, a 25% increase in secreted LIF occurred repeatedly in the presence of chloroquine, 2F. Blanchard, L. Duplomb, S. Raher, P. Vusio, B. Hoflack, Y. Jacques, and A. Godard, unpublished results. suggesting that Man-6-P-containing LIF molecules are well diverted to lysosomes. Direct analysis of the intracellular location of LIF is needed to confirm this hypothesis.Man-6-P/IGFII-R is also present at the plasma membrane where it mediates internalization and delivery of IGF-II (50Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21703-21708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and Man-6-P-containing ligands (lysosomal enzymes, proliferin, and latent TGF-β) (51Brunner A.M. Lioubin M.N. Marquardt H. Malacko A.R. Wang W.C. Shapiro R.A. Neubauer M. Cook J. Madisen L. Purchio A.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1691-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to the endocytic compartment. This receptor utilizes clathrin-coated vesicles via the AP-2 clathrin adapter complex for endocytosis (52Glickman J.N. Conibear E. Pearse B.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 53Sosa M.A. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Hille-Rehfeld A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12537-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LIF (and probably other factors such as M-CSF) is rapidly internalized and degraded by all cells expressing Man-6-P/IGFII-R at the plasma membrane, which indicates that this receptor is metabolically active after LIF binding. It is noteworthy that the tumor cell lines studied here for their secretion of Man-6-P-containing LIF all expressed physiological amounts of Man-6-P/IGFII-R and CD-MPR (11Blanchard F. Raher S. Duplomb L. Vusio P. Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Moreau J.F. Hoflack B. Minvielle S. Jacques Y. Godard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20886-20893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).2 The low percentage of Man-6-P-containing LIF could have been due to various post-translational regulatory events, including dephosphorylation, lysosome targeting, and internalization/degradation (LIF preparations obtained without added antiphosphatase, chloroquine, or Man-6-P).Man-6-P/IGFII-R is known to bind multiple ligands as follows: lysosomal enzymes (more than 50), soluble factors such as IGF-II, proliferin, latent TGF-β (see Ref. 12Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar for a review), retinoic acid (16Kang J.X. Yunyuan L. Leaf A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13671-13676Google Scholar), LIF, and M-CSF (11, and this paper), as well as some receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor (54Todderud G. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17893-17896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (15Nykjaer A. Christensen E.I. Vorum H. Hager H. Petersen C.M. Roigaard H. Min H.Y. Vilhardt F. Moller L.B. Kornfeld S. Gliemann J J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 815-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether other glycosylated cytokines can also bind to Man-6-P/IGFII-R. However, within the IL-6 family of cytokines, LIF seems to be the only member containing Man-6-P naturally in its carbohydrate moieties.The cytoplasmic domain of Man-6-P/IGFII-R is devoid of tyrosine kinase activity. However, some reports have suggested that Man-6-P/IGFII-R may function as a transmembrane signaling molecule. For example, IGF-II interaction with Man-6-P/IGFII-R has been reported to induce proliferation of Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts (27Nishimoto I. Hata Y. Ogata E. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12120-12126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), K652 cells (29Tally M. Li C.H. Hall K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), or OPM2 cells (30Nishiura T. Karasuno T. Yoshida H. Nakao H. Ogawa M. Horikawa Y. Yoshimura M. Okajima Y. Kanakura Y. Kanayama Y. Matsuzawa Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 3546-3554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, other reports have shown that Man-6-P/IGFII-R couples to heterotrimeric G proteins (55Okamoto T. Katada T. Murayama Y. Ui M. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. Cell. 1990; 62: 709-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 56Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Giambarella U. Yokota T. Nishimoto I. J.

Hammerman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9722-9727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and stimulates calcium influx (27Nishimoto I. Hata Y. Ogata E. Kojima I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 287-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Finally, a recent report has shown that either proliferin or IGF-II binding to Man-6-P/IGFII-R induces endothelial cell chemotaxis through a G protein-coupled, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent pathway (31Groskopf J.C. Syu L.J. Saltiel A.R. Linzer D.I. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2835-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). At present, there is no evidence for such LIF-mediated activation. Further experiments are needed to investigate IP3 production and ADP-ribosylation of G protein.Some reports have described a potentiation of IGF-II mitogenic activity by Man-6-P (43Rogers S.A. Hammerman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4273-4276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 58Feldman E.L. Randolph A.E. Brain Res. 1991; 562: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and indicated that endogenous Man-6-P-containing ligands can inhibit IGF-II bioactivity (44Murayama Y. Okamoto T. Ogata E. Asano T. Iiri T. Katada T. Ui M. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17456-17462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Man-6-P has also inhibited various biological activities not investigated in this study, such as activation of latent TGF-β (19Dennis P.A. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), lysosomal enzyme trafficking, and adhesion of myeloma cells to stromal cells (30Nishiura T. Karasuno T. Yoshida H. Nakao H. Ogawa M. Horikawa Y. Yoshimura M. Okajima Y. Kanakura Y. Kanayama Y. Matsuzawa Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 3546-3554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It cannot be excluded that Man-6-P-containing LIF modulates some of these functions. However, LIF did not modulate IGF-II activity on NIH3T3 cells, even when they were washed with Man-6-P prior to incubation with IGF-II (56Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Giambarella U. Yokota T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29224-29228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), possibly because the biological activity of IGF-II on NIH3T3 cells is mediated by IGF-I receptors or a third unknown receptor for IGF-II (59Zhang Q. Hall K. Tally M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 154: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).It is conceivable that a LIF molecule can bind one molecule each of gp190, gp130, and Man-6-P/IGFII-R, insofar as the respective binding sites on LIF do not seem to overlap (11Blanchard F. Raher S. Duplomb L. Vusio P. Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Moreau J.F. Hoflack B. Minvielle S. Jacques Y. Godard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20886-20893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Man-6-P/IGFII-R could therefore regulate LIF bioactivity, for example, by stabilizing high affinity receptors. However, no significant difference in biological activity has yet been observed between glycosylated and non-glycosylated LIF, although other biological tests need to be evaluated. The low percentage of Man-6-P-containing LIF in the preparations studied (2–20%) might also explain why no involvement of Man-6-P/IGFII-R was observed. Assessment of this issue implies a comparison of purified Man-6-P-containing LIF with non-glycosylated LIF. Preliminary experiments with a LIF preparation containing more than 95% of molecules able to bind to Man-6-P/IGFII-R seem to confirm that phosphorylated LIF is as active as E. coli-LIF or CHO-LIF on DA-1a cells and HepG2 cells.2In conclusion, the parallel between LIF and lysosomal enzymes or the growth factor IGF-II is intriguing; Man-6-P/IGFII-R is not able to transduce a biological signal after LIF binding on numerous cell lines but could be an important regulator of LIF metabolism and bioavailability. Some physiopathological circumstances have been described in which the functions of Man-6-P synthesizing enzymes or MPRs are impaired, i.e. in mucolipidosis II where a phosphotransferase defect is responsible for enhanced secretion of lysosomal enzymes in different body fluids (60Ludwig T. Ovitt C.E. Bauer U. Hollinshead M. Remmler J. Lobel P. Ruther U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5225-5235Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and in certain tumor cells where defective expression of Man-6-P/IGFII-R (allelic loss and point mutations) has been observed (20Hankins G.R.

To date, there have been four different classes of superoxide dismutases identified based on the metal involved in the catalysis: CuZn-SOD,1 Fe-SOD, Mn-SOD, and most recently Ni-SOD. Among these Mn-SOD and Fe-SOD are homologous based on amino acid sequences and crystal structures (1Holm R.H. Kenepohl P. Solomon E.I. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2239-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar), whereas CuZn-SOD and Ni-SOD are each clearly distinct and unique from the other forms. The manganese superoxide dismutases function through sequential redox processes in which the metal cycles between oxidized and reduced states (1Holm R.H. Kenepohl P. Solomon E.I. Chem.

Steady-state constants for catalysis of superoxide decay by manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) from Thermus thermophilus and for the human Mn-SOD are similar to kcat near 104 s−1 and kcat/Km between 108 and 109m−1s−1 (3Bull C.

Initial studies of Mn-SOD from Bacillus stearothermophilus used pulse radiolysis to determine that there is an initial burst of activity followed by an extended region of zero-order decay of superoxide. The zero-order region was explained as being due to the presence of a reversibly inhibited form of the enzyme that can interconvert to an active form (5McAdam M.E. Fox R.A. Lavelle F. Fielden E.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Bull et al. (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) observed the visible absorption spectrum of the enzyme during the zero-order phase of catalysis and, on the basis of comparison with visible absorption spectra of inorganic complexes, suggested that the zero-order phase results from product inhibition by peroxide. More specifically, they suggested a side-on peroxo complex of Mn(III)SOD resulting from the oxidative addition of O⨪2 to Mn(II)SOD. This inactive enzyme is represented as P-Mn+3-X in Equation 3. The zero-order rate is determined, in part, by the rate constant k−5 of Equation 2 for the return of the inactive form to a species in the catalytic cycle. Another possibility is that inhibition occurs by the conversion of an outer to an inner sphere complex of product peroxide with the manganese (6Cabelli D.E. Riley D. Rodriguez J.A. Valentine J.S. Zhu H. Meunier B. Biomimetic Oxidations Catalyzed by Transition Metal Complexes. Imperial College Press, London1999Google Scholar). Both CuZn-SOD and Fe-SOD are irreversibly inactivated by hydroxyl radicals produced by the Fenton reactions of H2O2 with their metal ions (6Cabelli D.E. Riley D. Rodriguez J.A. Valentine J.S. Zhu H. Meunier B. Biomimetic Oxidations Catalyzed by Transition Metal Complexes. Imperial College Press, London1999Google Scholar); Mn-SOD is not irreversibly inactivated in this manner. Thus, in this report product inhibition refers to the transitory inhibited complex of the zero-order phase observed during catalysis by Mn-SOD, and not to the irreversible type of inactivation that occurs in Fe-SOD and CuZn-SOD.Tyr-34, which is a conserved residue in Mn-SOD and Fe-SOD, is part of an extensive hydrogen bond network that includes Gln-143 and the metal-ligand cluster and may connect the properties of this tyrosine to catalysis at the metal (2Borgstahl G.E.O.

Y34F Mn-SOD is more product-inhibited during catalysis than wild type, demonstrated by the smaller decrease in [O⨪2] during the initial burst of catalysis and by a 4-fold slower rate in the zero-order inhibited region for Y34F compared with wild type (8Guan Y. Hickey M.J. Borgstahl G.E.O. Hallewell R.A. Lepock J.A. O'Connor D. Hsieh Y. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Tainer J.A.

An intermediate in the reduction by H2O2 was observed that has a visible spectrum nearly identical to that of the inhibited enzyme during the zero-order phase of catalysis of superoxide dismutation. This observation confirms the suggestion that the zero-order phase during catalysis represents a product-inhibited enzyme rather than alternative explanations such as a conformational change involving an inactive state.RESULTSUsing scanning stopped-flow spectrophotometry and mixing O⨪2 with Y34F Mn-SOD, and in separate experiments mixing H2O2 with Y34F Mn-SOD, we observed similar spectra characterized by an absorption with a maximum at 420 nm (Fig.1). The same experiments mixing H2O2 and wild-type Mn-SOD also showed similar spectra with maximum at 420 nm and a weak absorption near 630 nm (Fig.2); the spectrum for mixing O⨪2and wild-type Mn-SOD also showed an absorption at 420 nm but of lesser intensity (data not shown). These spectra are very similar to that of the complex that characterizes the zero-order phase in the O⨪2dismutation direction measured by Bull et al. (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A.

Moreover, the extinction coefficient at 420 nm for the complex derived from the spectrum of human Mn-SOD after mixing with H2O2 (Fig. 2) is 500m−1 cm−1, assuming complete conversion of enzyme to complex. This is an underestimate because it neglects the intermediate lost during the dead time of the instrument (∼1.4 ms). The value of ε410 ≈ 700m−1 cm−1 was found for this complex by Bull et al.

It represents a sample of mixed oxidation states Mn(III)SOD and Mn(II)SOD, the latter of which has a very weak absorption at 480 nm. (Fig. 2, inset curve 1); this is the predominant redox form of purified Mn-SOD (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The reduced enzyme Mn(II)SOD has an absorption spectrum that is very weak with broad absorption (ε < 50m−1 cm−1) and no peak in the range of 450–600 nm (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 13Fee J.A. Shapiro E.R. Moss T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6157-6159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The binding of azide to the wild-type human Mn-SOD (0.25 mm) was also investigated. The ratio of azide to enzyme concentrations was varied from 1:1 to 200:1. Interestingly, the spectrum of the enzyme fully complexed with azide (Fig. 2, inset curve 2) closely resembled that of the enzyme in the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide (Figs. 1 and 2), both showing a maximum absorbance near 420 nm.Because it took large concentrations of H2O2 to observe these spectra, their rate of appearance was too rapid to be measured within the dead time of the stopped-flow. However, we did observe the disappearance of these spectra to a very weak absorption consistent with the formation of Mn(II)SOD (Figs. 2 and3). The decrease of the absorption at 420 nm was adequately fit by a second-order process in wild-type enzyme with a rate constant of 55.5 ± 0.5 (absorbance units)−1 s−1 (Fig. 3). This corresponds to a rate constant of 0.1 m−1 s−1assuming ε420 = 500 m−1cm−1 for the complex. This result is similar to the value of 40 (absorbance units)−1 s−1 obtained from the experiment of Bull et al. (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) observing the decay at 480 nm after the introduction of H2O2 to wild-type Mn-SOD. The decrease of the absorption at 420 nm (Fig. 3) appeared equally well fit by the sum of two first-order processes with rate constants 7.0 ± 0.1 s−1 and 0.66 ± 0.01 s−1.Figure 3The decay of the absorbance at 420 nm after the mixing of H2O2 and manganese superoxide dismutase.

The second-order rate constant for decrease of the maximum at 420 nm was 23.7 ± 0.2 (absorbance units)−1 s−1. When fit to the sum of two exponentials, the rate constants were 4.1 ± 0.1 s−1 and 0.47 ± 0.01 s−1.In parallel experiments, human Mn-SOD was exposed briefly (10 s) to 100-fold molar excess of H2O2, which was then rapidly diluted. Subsequent removal of H2O2 by dialysis resulted in Mn-SOD that was fully active as measured by stopped-flow. Unlike its analog Fe-SOD, which is inactivated in the presence of H2O2 through the Fenton-type chemistry in which H2O2 reacts with iron (14Fridovich I. Adv. Enzymol. 1986; 41: 35-47Google Scholar), Mn-SOD is not a redox catalyst for Fenton chemistry. The result that Mn-SOD is not irreversibly inactivated with H2O2 is consistent with earlier reports of McAdam et al. (15McAdam M.E. Lavelle F. Fox R.A. Fielden E.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and more recent studies of Yamakura et al. (16Yamakura F. Rardin R.L. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Hiraoka B.Y. Nakayama K. Fujimura T. Taka H. Murayama K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe rapid mixing of H2O2 with human Mn(III)SOD and subsequent scanning stopped-flow spectrophotometry has resulted in the appearance of a visible absorption spectrum (Fig. 2) with a maximum and extinction coefficient very similar to that obtained by Bull et al. (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) for the inhibited complex in the dismutation direction, obtained after mixing of O⨪2 and T. thermophilus Mn-SOD. Moreover, the spectra of Fig. 2 are also similar to the spectrum of the inhibited complex of Y34F Mn-SOD in the dismutation direction and, in a separate experiment, after mixing with H2O2 (Fig. 1). Each spectrum shows a predominant absorbance near 420 nm and often a weak absorbance near 630 nm. This is the first reported observation of this complex obtained by the opposing reaction of H2O2 with Mn-SOD. It is significant in showing the nature of the zero-order phase of catalysis, supporting the interpretation of this phase as a form of product inhibition and providing another means by which this inhibition can be investigated. This result renders much less likely the attribution of this zero-order phase to a conformational change not related to product binding.At the rather large concentrations of both H2O2 and Mn(III)SOD that were used, we do not observe the build up of the concentration of the intermediate, which must occur within the dead time (near 1.4 ms) of the instrument. Instead, we have observed the decay of this intermediate complex to the featureless visible spectrum characteristic of Mn(II)SOD (Fig. 2). The decrease of the absorption at 420 nm characteristic of the intermediate form (Fig. 3) was adequately fit either by a second-order process in enzyme or by the sum of two exponentials. At this time, we cannot determine whether the second-order or the sum of two first-order processes is the best representation of the reaction. The larger of the first-order rate constants, 7 s−1, is close to k−5 = 10 s−1 determined by Bull et al. (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) by fitting progress curves (2 °C) of the dismutation catalysis, although it is smaller than the value of 130 s−1 (20 °C) determined for k−5by Hsu et al. (4Hsu J.-L. Hsieh Y. Tu C.K. O'Connor D. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17687-17691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The slower rate constant of these two exponentials, 0.7 s−1, is less readily explicable but could describe a long-lived intermediate in the decay of P-Mn+3-X or one of the many reactivities of O⨪2 and H2O2 (17Sawyer D.T. Valentine J.S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1981; 14: 393-399Crossref Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Bull et al. (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) carried out experiments observing the rate of decrease of the absorbance at 480 nm following mixing by stopped-flow of T. thermophilus Mn-SOD and excess H2O2. The decay of the 480 nm absorbance was best fit by second-order kinetics, which they ascribe to the slow reduction of Mn(III)SOD by H2O2 resulting in Mn(II)SOD and O⨪2, and then the subsequent reaction of O⨪2 with a second Mn(III)SOD. The work reported here differs in that it addresses the 420 nm absorption characteristic of the inhibited form of the enzyme.Regardless of whether the decay of the peroxide-enzyme complex is best described by a second-order or two first-order processes, it was observed that the visible absorption spectrum of the intermediate formed upon mixing H2O2 and Mn(III)SOD changed to that consistent with Mn(II)SOD about twice as fast for wild type as for Y34F Mn-SOD. This smaller rate of decay of the inhibited complex for Y34F Mn-SOD probably contributes to the enhanced product inhibition of this mutant compared with wild type. The models for catalysis of both McAdam et al. (5McAdam M.E. Fox R.A. Lavelle F. Fielden E.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and Bull et al. (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) relate the magnitude of inhibition and the zero-order rate constant of the inhibited phase to this decay rate designated k−5 of Equation 2. However, it is important to point out that many of the rate constants of Equations 1 and 2 besides k−5 could also possibly contribute to the greater product inhibition of Y34F Mn-SOD observed during the catalyzed dismutation of O⨪2; the observation of a smaller rate of decay for the spectrum of the complex formed on mixing H2O2 and Y34F Mn-SOD is suggestive rather than sufficient for greater product inhibition in the dismutation direction.We observed a similarity in visible absorption spectra of Mn-SOD in the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide and Mn-SOD complexed with azide (Fig. 2, inset curve 2). The crystal structure of the azide complex of Mn(III)SOD from T. thermophilus shows a six-coordinate species with the azide bound to the metal and forming a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl of Tyr-34 (18Lah M.S. Dixon M.M. Pattridge K.A. Stallings W.C. Fee J.A. Ludwig M.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1646-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This suggests that the complex we observed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, like the azide complex, may have expanded coordination geometry, which might occur if the peroxide is a direct ligand in its complex with Mn(III)SOD and does not displace the aqueous ligand, or the peroxy ligand displaces the aqueous ligand by forming a side-on peroxo (bidentate) complex as proposed by Bull et al. (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The similarity of anion complexes of E. coli Mn-SOD with the product-inhibited complex has been discussed by Whittaker and Whittaker (19Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6762-6770Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutases are enzymes that catalyze the disproportionation of superoxide to yield oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. To date, there have been four different classes of superoxide dismutases identified based on the metal involved in the catalysis: CuZn-SOD,1 Fe-SOD, Mn-SOD, and most recently Ni-SOD. Among these Mn-SOD and Fe-SOD are homologous based on amino acid sequences and crystal structures (1Holm R.H. Kenepohl P. Solomon E.I. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2239-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar), whereas CuZn-SOD and Ni-SOD are each clearly distinct and unique from the other forms. The manganese superoxide dismutases function through sequential redox processes in which the metal cycles between oxidized and reduced states (1Holm R.H. Kenepohl P. Solomon E.I. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2239-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar).P­Mn+3+O⨪2⇄k−1k1[P­Mn+3−O⨪2]→k2P­Mn+2+O2Equation 1 P­Mn+2+O⨪2+2H+⇄k−3k3[P­Mn2+­O⨪2]+2H+⇄k−4k4P­Mn+3+H2O2k5⇵k−5P­Mn+3−XEquation 2 Here P-Mn+3 represents the protein bound to metal through three histidines and one aspartate as ligands; there is also one aqueous ligand in this trigonal bipyramidal geometry (2Borgstahl G.E.O.

Steady-state constants for catalysis of superoxide decay by manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) from Thermus thermophilus and for the human Mn-SOD are similar to kcat near 104 s−1 and kcat/Km between 108 and 109m−1s−1 (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 4Hsu J.-L. Hsieh Y. Tu C.K. O'Connor D. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17687-17691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Initial studies of Mn-SOD from Bacillus stearothermophilus used pulse radiolysis to determine that there is an initial burst of activity followed by an extended region of zero-order decay of superoxide. The zero-order region was explained as being due to the presence of a reversibly inhibited form of the enzyme that can interconvert to an active form (5McAdam M.E. Fox R.A. Lavelle F. Fielden E.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Bull et al. (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) observed the visible absorption spectrum of the enzyme during the zero-order phase of catalysis and, on the basis of comparison with visible absorption spectra of inorganic complexes, suggested that the zero-order phase results from product inhibition by peroxide. More specifically, they suggested a side-on peroxo complex of Mn(III)SOD resulting from the oxidative addition of O⨪2 to Mn(II)SOD. This inactive enzyme is represented as P-Mn+3-X in Equation 3. The zero-order rate is determined, in part, by the rate constant k−5 of Equation 2 for the return of the inactive form to a species in the catalytic cycle. Another possibility is that inhibition occurs by the conversion of an outer to an inner sphere complex of product peroxide with the manganese (6Cabelli D.E. Riley D. Rodriguez J.A. Valentine J.S. Zhu H. Meunier B. Biomimetic Oxidations Catalyzed by Transition Metal Complexes. Imperial College Press, London1999Google Scholar). Both CuZn-SOD and Fe-SOD are irreversibly inactivated by hydroxyl radicals produced by the Fenton reactions of H2O2 with their metal ions (6Cabelli D.E. Riley D. Rodriguez J.A. Valentine J.S. Zhu H. Meunier B. Biomimetic Oxidations Catalyzed by Transition Metal Complexes. Imperial College Press, London1999Google Scholar); Mn-SOD is not irreversibly inactivated in this manner. Thus, in this report product inhibition refers to the transitory inhibited complex of the zero-order phase observed during catalysis by Mn-SOD, and not to the irreversible type of inactivation that occurs in Fe-SOD and CuZn-SOD. Tyr-34, which is a conserved residue in Mn-SOD and Fe-SOD, is part of an extensive hydrogen bond network that includes Gln-143 and the metal-ligand cluster and may connect the properties of this tyrosine to catalysis at the metal (2Borgstahl G.E.O.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8202-8208Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Y34F Mn-SOD shows that its active-site structure is nearly exactly superimposable with that of the wild type except for the absence of the side-chain hydroxyl of residue 34 (8Guan Y.

The mutants Y34F Mn-SOD and Y34F Fe-SOD have been observed in a number of studies comparing their catalytic and spectral properties to the wild type (7Sorkin D.L. Duong D.K. Miller A.-F.

The catalytic activity of these mutants is decreased as much as 10-fold. Y34F Mn-SOD is more product-inhibited during catalysis than wild type, demonstrated by the smaller decrease in [O⨪2] during the initial burst of catalysis and by a 4-fold slower rate in the zero-order inhibited region for Y34F compared with wild type (8Guan Y. Hickey M.J. Borgstahl G.E.O. Hallewell R.A. Lepock J.A. O'Connor D. Hsieh Y. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Tainer J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We have used scanning stopped-flow spectrophotometry to measure both the appearance of the inhibited enzyme in the zero-order phase of the dismutation of O⨪2 catalyzed by Mn-SOD and the reduction of Mn(III)SOD by excess H2O2; these measurements were extended to Y34F Mn-SOD as well. An intermediate in the reduction by H2O2 was observed that has a visible spectrum nearly identical to that of the inhibited enzyme during the zero-order phase of catalysis of superoxide dismutation. This observation confirms the suggestion that the zero-order phase during catalysis represents a product-inhibited enzyme rather than alternative explanations such as a conformational change involving an inactive state. RESULTSUsing scanning stopped-flow spectrophotometry and mixing O⨪2 with Y34F Mn-SOD, and in separate experiments mixing H2O2 with Y34F Mn-SOD, we observed similar spectra characterized by an absorption with a maximum at 420 nm (Fig.1).

These spectra are very similar to that of the complex that characterizes the zero-order phase in the O⨪2dismutation direction measured by Bull et al. (3Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A.

Under nonenzymatic conditions, a couple of one-electron oxidants easily oxidize NADH to the NAD⋅ radical. This radical reduces molecular oxygen to the superoxide radical (O⨪2) at a near to the diffusion-controlled rate, thereby subsequently forming hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Because peroxynitrite can act as a one-electron oxidant, the reaction of NAD(P)H with both authentic peroxynitrite and the nitric oxide (⋅NO) and O⨪2 releasing compound 3-morpholinosydnonimine N-ethylcarbamide (SIN-1) was studied. Authentic peroxynitrite oxidized NADH with an efficiency of ∼25 and 8% in the absence and presence of bicarbonate/carbon dioxide (HCO3−/CO2), respectively. NADH reacted 5–100 times faster with peroxynitrite than do the known peroxynitrite scavengers glutathione, cysteine, and tryptophan. Furthermore, NADH was found to be highly effective in suppressing peroxynitrite-mediated nitration reactions even in the presence of HCO3−/CO2. Reaction of NADH with authentic peroxynitrite resulted in the formation of NAD+ and O⨪2 and, thus, of H2O2 with yields of about 3 and 10% relative to the added amounts of peroxynitrite and NADH, respectively. Peroxynitrite generated in situ from SIN-1 gave virtually the same results; however, two remarkable exceptions were recognized. First, the efficiency of NADH oxidation increased to 60–90% regardless of the presence of HCO3−/CO2, along with an increase of H2O2 formation to about 23 and 35% relative to the amounts of added SIN-1 and NADH. Second, and more interesting, the peroxynitrite scavenger glutathione (GSH) was needed in a 75-fold surplus to inhibit the SIN-1-dependent oxidation of NADH half-maximal in the presence of HCO3−/CO2. Similar results were obtained with NADPH. Hence, peroxynitrite or radicals derived from it (such as, e.g. the bicarbonate radical or nitrogen dioxide) indeed oxidize NADH, leading to the formation of NAD+ and, via O⨪2, of H2O2.

Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar, 2Kobayashi K. Miki M. Tagawa A. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1995; : 2885-2889Crossref Google Scholar). This anion and its conjugated acid (hydrogen oxoperoxonitrate(1−), ONOOH), collectively often referred to as peroxynitrite, have been suggested to be decisively involved as cytotoxic agents in several pathophysiological processes like, e.g. atherosclerosis (3White C.R. Brock T.A. Chang L.Y. Crapo J. Briscoe P. Ku D. Bradley W.A. Gianturco S.H. Gore J. Freeman B.A. Tarpey M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. 1991; 88: 6368-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). The pathological activity of peroxynitrite presumably is based on its capability to oxidize protein and nonprotein sulfhydryls (5Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), membrane phospholipids (6Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar), low density lipoproteins (3White C.R. Brock T.A. Chang L.Y. Crapo J. Briscoe P. Ku D. Bradley W.A. Gianturco S.H. Gore J. Freeman B.A. Tarpey M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1044-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), and to nitrate tyrosine (7Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ye Y.Z. Kelly D.R. Beckman J.S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 151: 1250-1254PubMed Google Scholar). Under in vivo conditions, low amounts of peroxynitrite seem to be formed continuously. This process can be mimicked in experimental systems with the O⨪2 and⋅NO-releasing compound SIN-1.1 Peroxynitrite generated in situ from SIN-1 has been shown to attack many biological targets (e.g. low density lipoproteins (3White C.R. Brock T.A. Chang L.Y. Crapo J. Briscoe P. Ku D. Bradley W.A. Gianturco S.H. Gore J. Freeman B.A. Tarpey M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1044-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar)) in nearly the same manner as bolus addition of authentic peroxynitrite. We have recently reported (8Kirsch M. Lomonosova E.E. Korth H.G. Sustmann R. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12716-12724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) that both authentic and in situ generated peroxynitrite oxidizes HEPES and related tertiary amines in a one-electron step with initial formation of an amine radical cation. Subsequent α-deprotonation generates an α-aminoalkyl radical that rapidly reduces molecular oxygen to O⨪2, from which H2O2 is further produced. This reaction appears to be so effective that, in the presence of HEPES, SIN-1-induced cytotoxicity to L929 cells was mainly conveyed by H2O2 but not by ONOO−/ONOOH (9Lomonosova L.L. Kirsch M. Rauen U. de Groot H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As HEPES and related tertiary amines are widely used to maintain the pH in biological systems, numerous studies of the (patho)physiological effects of peroxynitrite must be expected to be obscured by this mechanism, that is H2O2-driven pathways instead of peroxynitrite-mediated effects may have been observed. Consequently, the question arises whether the reaction mechanism elucidated for the reaction of peroxynitrite with HEPES also applies to biologically relevant tertiary amines. One very likely candidate for such an in vivo relevant tertiary amine is NADH as indicated by the following findings: (i) Kobayashi et al. (10Kobayashi K. Miki M. Tagawa S. Endothelium. 1995; 3 (suppl.): 65Google Scholar) have found that peroxynitrite reacts with NADH with a second-order rate constant of 4 × 103m−1s−1 at pH 7.4, and Ewing et al. (11Ewing J.F. Janero D.R. Grinnell T.A. Schroeder J.D. Garvey D.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) observed a high efficiency of SIN-1 to oxidize NADH to NAD+ in the absence of HCO3−/CO2. However, both groups did not provide any further information on the resulting products and on the underlying mechanism. (ii) NADH is very sensitive toward one-electron oxidants (12Schellenberg K.A. Hellerman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 547-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) The Br⨪2 radical, which has a standard reduction potential close to that of peroxynitrous acid [E°(Br⨪2/2 Br−) = 1.62 V (13Stanbury D.M. Sykes A.G. Advances in Inorganic Chemistry. Academic Press, San Diego1989: 69-138Google Scholar), E°(ONOOH/NO2·(aq)) = 1.6 V (14Koppenol W.H. Kissner R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)], has been reported to attack NADH via one-electron transfer (Reaction 1) (15Land E.J. Swallow A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 234: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).NADH+Br⨪2→NADH∔+2Br−REACTION1Subsequent deprotonation leads to an alkyl radical (NAD⋅) that rapidly (k = 2 × 109m−1 s−1) reduces oxygen to superoxide radicals (15Land E.J. Swallow A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 234: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) from which H2O2 is formed (Reactions 2–4).NADH∔→NAD·+H+REACTION2NAD·+O2→NAD++O⨪2REACTION32O⨪2+2H+→H2O2+O2REACTION4These findings led us to assume that substitution of Br⨪2by peroxynitrite should also result in O⨪2/H2O2 formation via the same mechanism. The present study was carried out to verify this hypothesis. Interestingly, the experiments with authentic peroxynitrite and peroxynitrite generated in situ from SIN-1 led to surprising different results. Catalase from beef liver (EC 1.11.1.6), peroxidase from horseradish (EC 1.11.1.7), lactate dehydrogenase from hog muscle (EC 1.1.1. 27), alcohol dehydrogenase from yeast (EC1.1.1.1), Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes (EC1.15.1.1), NADH, NAD+, and NADPH were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Manganese superoxide dismutase from Escherichia coli, manganese dioxide, H2O2, DTPA, and ADP-ribose were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Commercially available mixtures of oxygen 5.0 and nitrogen 5.0 (20.5% O2, 79.5% N2, “synthetic air”) and commercially available mixtures of oxygen 5.0 and nitrogen 5.0 and carbon dioxide 4.6 (20.5% O2, 74.5% N2, 5% CO2) were purchased from Messer-Griessheim (Oberhausen, Germany). SIN-1 and its decomposition product, SIN-1C, were generously provided by Dr. K. Schönafinger (Hoechst Marion Roussel, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). Oxoperoxonitrate(1−) (0.73 m) was prepared by isoamylnitrite-induced nitrosation of hydrogen peroxide (0.12 mol isoamylnitrite, 100 ml H2O2 (1 m) plus DTPA (2 mm)) and purified (e.g. solvent extraction, removal of excess H2O2, N2-purging) as described by Uppu and Pryor (16Uppu R.M. Pryor W.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 242-249Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and stored at −79 °C. All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Care was taken to exclude possible contamination by bicarbonate/carbon dioxide. Double-distilled water was bubbled (2 l/min) with synthetic air at room temperature for 20 min. This water was used for synthesis of oxoperoxonitrate(1−), NaOH (0.01–0.5 N) and for all other solutions. Potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm) containing DTPA (0.1 mm) was prepared freshly each day. The pH was adjusted to 7.5 at 37 °C, and the solution was again bubbled (2 l/min) with synthetic air or with the CO2 mixture for 20 min. In the case of bubbling with the CO2 mixture, the pH had to be readjusted to 7.5. SIN-1 solutions were prepared as 100× stock solutions at 4 °C in 50 mmKH2PO4 and used within 15 min. SIN-1 was added to 1 ml of phosphate buffer and incubated in 12-well cell culture plates (volume of each well was 7 ml, Falcon, Heidelberg, Germany). For the detection of H2O2 with the catalase assay, SIN-1 was added to 10 ml of buffer and incubated in tissue culture dishes (75 ml, Falcon, Heidelberg, Germany). Under HCO3−/CO2-free conditions, these plates/dishes were placed in an air-tight vessel (10 l). During the first 15 min of each experiment, these vessels were flushed (5 l/min) with synthetic air in a warming incubator (Heraeus, Hanau, Germany). In the presence of HCO3−/CO2, the plates/dishes were placed in an incubator for cell culture (37 °C, humidified atmosphere of 95% authentic air and 5% CO2, Labotect, Göttingen, Germany). The experiments with authentic peroxynitrite (2 μl of 0.35–0.035 m ONOO−in 0.5 N NaOH was added to 1 ml of reaction solution) were performed in reaction tubes (1.4 ml, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) by using the drop-tube Vortex mixer technique as described previously (8Kirsch M. Lomonosova E.E. Korth H.G. Sustmann R. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12716-12724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Under HCO3−/CO2-free conditions, the experiments with authentic peroxynitrite were performed in a glove-bag (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) under synthetic air. Hydrogen peroxide was quantified by various techniques. In peroxidase assays, horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed formation of a colored or a fluorescent product was measured. In these assays, residual NADH (0–200 μm) was removed first by its enzymatic conversion to NAD+ (10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 0–200 μm pyruvate, 15-min incubation at 37 °C). Relatively high amounts of H2O2, i.e. 5–100 μm, were detected with 4-aminoantipyrine and 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid as substrates. The quinoneimine dye formed from these substrates was measured spectrophotometrically at 546 nm (17Ioannidis I. de Groot H. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (4-aminoantipyrine peroxidase assay). Concentrations of H2O2 in the range of 1–30 μm were analyzed with p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (p-HPA) as the peroxidase substrate as described by Gonzalez-Flecha (18Gonzalez-Flecha B. Cutrin J.C. Boveris A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) (p-HPA peroxidase assay). The fluorescence of the dimer of p-HPA was recorded at excitation 322 nm and emission 410 nm on a spectrophotofluorometer (Amico-Bowman, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA). Alternatively, H2O2 was quantified by the amount of O2 released upon addition of catalase (1000 units/ml) (catalase assay). O2 was determined polarographically with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Eschweiler, Kiel, Germany). Superoxide radicals were determined by using the modified ferricytochrome c reduction technique of McCord and Fridovich (19McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various concentrations of peroxynitrite (50–2000 μm) were vortexed to the reaction solution in the presence of NADH (500 μm) and cytochrome c 3+ (20 μm) or cytochrome c 3+ plus SOD (625 nm, i.e. 100 units/ml). NADH was added in surplus amounts to prevent reaction of (residual) peroxynitrite with SOD and cytochrome c 2+ formed. The resulting mixture was stored for 2 min at 37 °C. Cytochrome c 2+ formation was determined by reading its absorbance at 550 nm (Δε550 = 21000 m−1 cm−1) (20Massey V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The difference in cytochrome c reduction in the presence and absence of SOD was used to calculate the amount of trapped O⨪2. SIN-1 and SIN-1C were quantified by capillary zone electrophoresis on a Beckman P/ACE 5000 apparatus as described previously (8Kirsch M. Lomonosova E.E. Korth H.G. Sustmann R. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12716-12724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). NAD+ was determined by capillary zone electrophoresis under the following conditions: fused silica capillary (50-cm effective length, 75-μm internal diameter), hydrodynamic injection for 5 s, 30 °C temperature, 15 kV voltage, reversed polarity, UV detection at 254 nm. 50 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (pH 7.0) was used as electrolyte system. To each sample, 0.25 mm 4-aminobenzamide was added as internal standard. Alternatively, NAD+ was determined by an enzymatic method using yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, ethanol, and semicarbazide (alcohol dehydrogenase assay) as described by Klingenberg (21Klingenberg M. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany1985: 251-271Google Scholar). After treatment with authentic peroxynitrite or with SIN-1, residual NAD(P)H was quantified by reading its fluorescence with excitation at 339 nm and emission at 460 nm (21Klingenberg M. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany1985: 251-271Google Scholar). Standard calibration curves were prepared from known amounts of NAD(P)H. Additionally, the oxidation of NAD(P)H was also followed photometrically at 340 nm using Δε340 = 6200 m−1 cm−1 (21Klingenberg M. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany1985: 251-271Google Scholar). Both methods gave identical results; therefore, only one parameter, decrease of fluorescence, will be shown. Peroxynitrite (1 mm)-dependent nitrations of p-HPA, tyrosine, and tryptophan (each 1 mm) were employed. After vortexing, the samples were allowed to stand for 2 min. In the case of tryptophan, the absorbance of 6-nitrotryptophan (22Alvarez B. Rubbo H. Kirk M. Barnes S. Freeman B.A. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) was detected photometrically at 400 nm (εM = 5200 m−1cm−1). With p-HPA and tyrosine as targets, 0.5–1 N NaOH was added (4:1 v/v, final pH 11–11.5). The formed products, i.e. 3-nitro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3-NO2-4-HPA) or 3-nitrotyrosine, were determined by reading the absorbance at 430 nm (εM = 4400m−1 cm−1) (16Uppu R.M. Pryor W.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 242-249Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and at 428 nm (εM = 4200 m−1cm−1) (23Van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. O'Neill C.A. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), respectively. In the absence of HCO3−/CO2, peroxynitrite (0–800 μm) oxidized NADH (200 μm) with an efficiency of ∼25%, whereas in the presence HCO3−/CO2 (20 mm, 5%) only ∼8% of the added amount of peroxynitrite was able to oxidize NADH (Fig. 1). Because HCO3−/CO2 is believed to act as peroxynitrite scavenger, the influence of other known peroxynitrite scavengers, namely cysteine, glutathione, methionine, and tryptophan, on peroxynitrite-dependent consumption of NADH was studied (TableI). Rather high concentrations of these scavengers, i.e. [scavenger] >5 × [NADH], were needed to inhibit peroxynitrite-dependent consumption of NADH half-maximally. Interestingly, the HO⋅ radical scavenger Me2SO (up to 50 mm), which convincingly has been shown to scavenge HO⋅ radicals derived from peroxynitrite (25Richeson C.E. Mulder P. Bowry V.W. Ingold K.U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 7211-7219Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar), did not exhibit any protective effect on peroxynitrite (0.25 mm)-mediated oxidation of NADH (200 μm, data not shown). In further experiments, the chemical reactivity of NADPH toward peroxynitrite was compared with that of NADH. Virtually the same results were obtained. Thus, after addition of 0.25 mmperoxynitrite to 200 μm NADPH in the absence of HCO3−/CO2 133.8 ± 4.7 μm, residual NADPH was detected, and the concentration of GSH necessary to protect NADPH half-maximal was also 1.1 ± 0.1 mm.Table IInfluence of scavengers on peroxynitrite-mediated consumption of NADHScavengerScavenger501-aScavenger50, scavenger concentration necessary to inhibit peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation of NADH half-maximal.Peroxynitrite rate constant of the scavenging reaction at 37 °CApparent reaction rate constant of NADH at 37 °Cmmk/m−1s−1Cysteine1.1 ± 0.15900 (5Radi R.

Based on the data of Table I, we suspected that NADH inhibited peroxynitrite-mediated nitration reactions (TableII). Interactions of peroxynitrite (1 mm) with the target compounds p-HPA, tyrosine, and tryptophan (each 1 mm) in the absence and in the presence of HCO3−/CO2yielded amounts of nitrated products that were virtually identical to those reported previously (8Kirsch M.

The addition of NADH very strongly decreased the peroxynitrite-mediated nitration of the selected compounds under both conditions. Concentrations of NADH in the range of 100–200 μm reduced the formation of nitroaromatics by 50% in the HCO3−/CO2-free situation, in the presence of HCO3−/CO2 the concentrations of NADH had to be increased to 480–580 μmto inhibit the formation of the nitrated products half-maximally.Table IIEffect of NADH on the peroxynitrite-induced nitration of aromatic compoundsTargetAbsence of HCO3−/CO2Presence of HCO3−/CO2Nitrated productsNADH502-aNADH50, NADH concentration necessary to inhibit the peroxynitrite-mediated nitration of the target compounds half-maximal.Nitrated productsNADH501 mmμmp-HPA79.4 ± 1.398 ± 4189.1 ± 2.9580 ± 10Tyrosine69.8 ± 0.995 ± 4191.1 ± 3.8580 ± 12Tryptophan97.1 ± 2.1190 ± 9168.3 ± 3.2480 ± 13Peroxynitrite (1 mm) was vortexed to para-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (p-HPA), tyrosine, and tryptophan (each 1 mm) in the absence and presence of HCO3−/CO2 (20 mm, 5%), NADH (0–1000 μm) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 mm DTPA, 37 °C, pH 7.5).

After a 5-min incubation at 37 °C, the formation of nitrated products (3-(NO2)-4-HPA, 3-nitrotyrosine, 5-nitrotryptophan) were determined by reading the absorbance at maximum (400–430 nm). Each value represents the mean ± S.D. of four experiments performed in duplicate. The reaction of peroxynitrite with NADH yielded exclusively NAD+ at concentrations of peroxynitrite lower or comparable with those of NADH, irrespective of the presence of HCO3−/CO2(capillary zone electrophoresis and alcohol dehydrogenase assay, data not shown). The situation somehow changed when excess concentrations of peroxynitrite were employed. Whereas in the presence of HCO3−/CO2, NADH was still exclusively oxidized to NAD+ (up to 4 mmperoxynitrite, 200 μm NADH), in the absence of HCO3−/CO2, only 167 ± 7 μm NAD+ were formed upon addition of 2 mm peroxynitrite to 200 μm NADH (alcohol dehydrogenase assay). Now ADP-ribose was detected as additional reaction product (capillary zone electrophoresis, data not shown). The most commonly used assay for O⨪2 comprises the reduction of cytochrome c 3+ in the absence and presence of SOD (19McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome c 2+ and SOD, however, react rapidly with peroxynitrite at reaction rate constants of 2.3 × 105m−1 s−1 (27Thomson L. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and about 1 × 105m−1s−1 (28Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar), respectively. Thus, the use of both proteins to detect O⨪2 in the presence of peroxynitrite would yield ambiguous results. On the other hand, as peroxynitrite reacts with NADH at a rate constant of k ≈ 1 × 104m−1 s−1 (Table I), the reaction of (residual) peroxynitrite with both cytochrome c 2+ (formed from reaction of cytochrome c 3+ (20 μm) with O⨪2) and SOD (625 nm, i.e. 100 units/ml) should occur to only a very limited degree in the presence of 500 μmNADH. Formation of O⨪2 was undetectable in the absence of peroxynitrite (Fig. 2). After addition of 50 μm peroxynitrite, the formation of about 10 μm O⨪2 was detected. Formation of O⨪2further slightly increased with increasing concentration of peroxynitrite to a maximum value of 12.1 ± 0.2 μmO⨪2 at 200 μm peroxynitrite. Thus, attack of peroxynitrite on NADH indeed generates O⨪2. At higher peroxynitrite concentrations, formation of superoxide apparently decreased until, at 2 mm peroxynitrite, formation of O⨪2 could not longer be detected, presumably because of the reaction of excess peroxynitrite with cytochrome c 2+. In the absence of NADH, only low amounts of H2O2 (0–3.4 ± 0.1 μm) (p-HPA peroxidase assay) were found upon addition of ONOO− to mere phosphate buffer (Fig.3), reflecting the detectable hydrogen peroxide base level of 0.29 mol % of our peroxynitrite stock solution rather than H2O2 formation from peroxynitrite. In the presence of NADH, H2O2 was produced, and its concentration increased linearly with the concentration of peroxynitrite. The yield of H2O2 accounted for ∼2.7% of the amount of added peroxynitrite and about 10.8% of the consumed NADH. At peroxynitrite concentrations higher than 700 μm, i.e. when all of the NADH was consumed (see Fig. 1), formation of H2O2 levelled off. Noticeably, the stepwise addition of ONOO− (five × 140 μm each) to the 200 μm NADH doubled the yield of H2O2 to 39.8 ± 1.3 μm (4-aminoantipyrine peroxidase assay), corresponding to ∼5.7% of the accumulated amount of peroxynitrite and ∼19.9% of the consumed NADH. In the presence of HCO3−/CO2 (20 mm, 5%), only 13.1 ± 1.0 μmH2O2 (p-HPA peroxidase assay) was formed upon addition of peroxynitrite (700 μm) to NADH (200 μm). This result is in line with the decreased consumption of NADH in the presence of HCO3−/CO2. However, the yield of H2O2 now accounted for ∼21% relative to the consumed NADH, i.e. twice as muc"
https://openalex.org/W1981234790,"During development, tissue repair, and tumor metastasis, both cell-cell dissociation and cell migration occur and appear to be intimately linked, such as during epithelial “scattering.” Here we show that cell-cell dissociation during scattering induced by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) or activation of the temperature-sensitive v-Src tyrosine kinase in MDCK cells can be blocked by inhibiting the proteasome with lactacystin and MG132. Although both proteins of the tight junction and the adherens junction redistributed during cell scattering, proteasome inhibitors largely prevented this process, resulting in the stabilization of Triton X-100-insoluble tight junction proteins as well as adherens junction proteins at sites of cell-cell contact. Proteasome inhibition also led to a decrease of E-cadherin turnover in 35S-labeled cells. In addition, proteasome inhibition partly preserved cell polarity, as determined by the subcellular distribution of Na+,K+-ATPase (basolateral marker) and gp135 (apical marker), and the structure of the subcortical actin ring, both of which are normally disrupted during scattering. However, cells were able to establish focal contacts, and single cell migration toward HGF was unaffected by proteasome inhibition in quantitative assays, indicating that cell-cell dissociation during scattering occurs independently of anchorage-dependent cell migration. Thus, a proteasome-dependent step during scattering induced by HGF and pp60v-Src appears to be essential for cell-cell dissociation, disassembly of junctional components, and (at least indirectly) it also plays a role in the loss of protein polarity. During development, tissue repair, and tumor metastasis, both cell-cell dissociation and cell migration occur and appear to be intimately linked, such as during epithelial “scattering.” Here we show that cell-cell dissociation during scattering induced by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) or activation of the temperature-sensitive v-Src tyrosine kinase in MDCK cells can be blocked by inhibiting the proteasome with lactacystin and MG132.

Cell. 1996; 84: 335-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). In general, the structure and function of these intercellular junctions depends upon transmembrane proteins (e.g. E-cadherin, occludin/claudins) that are linked to nonmembrane proteins on the cytosolic face, which in turn are associated with the actin-based cytoskeleton (3Aberle H.

Under steady-state conditions, the assembly and maintenance of these intercellular junctions appear to be tightly regulated (3Aberle H. Schwartz H. Kemler R. J. Cell.

However, during development, cell division, inflammation, and tissue repair, as well as invasion and metastasis of tumor cells, these structures are disassembled and sometimes internalized as cells diminish their contacts and become motile (2Drubin D.G.

Little is known of the molecular basis of junction disassembly and reassembly during the alterations in cell-cell interactions and motility that characterize these highly dynamic states of tissue remodeling, regeneration, and transformation, although in models such as the “calcium switch,” a variety of signaling molecules, including protein kinase Cs, calcium, and GTP binding proteins have been implicated in junctional reassembly (10Stuart R.O.

A key question concerning cell dissociation during cell movement is the metabolic fate of components within junctional complexes. One well studied experimental system in which this issue is clearly important is “scattering.” Epithelial cell scattering requires the attenuation or dissolution of cell-cell adhesion before cell-cell dissociation and motility (14Rosen E.M. Goldberg I.D. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To perform an analysis that might be applicable to a broader context, we employed two different systems: scattering induced by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and scattering resulting from the activation of temperature-sensitive v-Src tyrosine kinase (pp60v-Src) (15Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. van Roy F. Mareel M.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). We now show that cell-cell dissociation during scattering induced by HGF or pp60v-Src in MDCK epithelial cells can be blocked by inhibiting the proteasome without affecting cell migration, resulting in stabilization of junctional proteins at sites of cell-cell contact. We conclude that the proteasome plays an essential role as a regulator of cell-cell dissociation during cell movement. MDCK cells (type II) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2. Temperature-sensitive v-Src MDCK cells kindly provided by Drs. J. Behrens and W. Birchmeier (Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Biology, Germany) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum at 40 °C. Cell permeable protease inhibitors were purchased from Biomol (lactacystin, MG132, ALLN, E64, and calpeptin) and Sigma (chloroquine and primaquine). HGF was kindly supplied by Dr. T. Nakamura (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). Anti-ZO-1 rat monoclonal antibody (R40.76) and anti-ZO-2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (kindly supplied by Dr. D. Goodenough, Harvard University), anti-occludin polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-E-cadherin mouse monoclonal antibody (rr1) and anti-Na+,K+-ATPase β subunit mouse monoclonal antibody (by Dr. K.

Ojakian, State University of New York Health Science Center), anti-α-catenin rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma), and anti-β-catenin and anti-paxillin mouse monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) were used. Cells were lysed with a modified RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, a protease inhibitor mixture consisting 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/aprotinin and 20 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin A, and antipain) on ice, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 14,000 × g. Protein content was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce), and 50 μg/lane of total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed with a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, plus a protease inhibitor mixture (TN buffer) for 30 min at 4 °C, and insoluble materials were separated by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatant containing 1 mg of protein was clarified and incubated either with anti-ZO-1 or anti-E-cadherin antibody on a rocking platform at 4 °C overnight. The immune complexes were collected either with anti-rat IgG-Sepharose (Organon Teknika, West Chester, PA) or protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western immunoblotting using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Labs, West Grove, PA) and the ECL kit (Pierce) as described (11Stuart R.O.

Cells were scraped into CSK-A buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm sucrose, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate) plus the protease inhibitor mixture and extracted for 20 min at 4 °C on a gently rocking platform. The extract (E-fraction) was separated by centrifugation (14,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C, and the residue (R-fraction) was dissolved in 2× sample buffer. Equal volumes of both fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western immunoblot. Blots were quantified with NIH image software as described (11Stuart R.O. Sun A. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K.

Cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (100 μCi/ml, Expre 35S35S labeling mix; NEN Life Science Products) for 3 h. After the labeling period, cells were chased for 0, 3, 8, or 16 h in normal growth medium, lysed in CSK-B buffer (0.5% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 300 mm sucrose, and a protease inhibitor mixture), and boiled for 5 min. Then the lysates were diluted with 5 volumes of CSK-A buffer. Equal amounts of protein in supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation. Immunecomplexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose beads, washed with CSK-A buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Labeled proteins were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). MDCK cells grown on a type I collagen-coated coverslip were either directly fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde or after extraction with CSK-A buffer for 20 min at 4 °C. Immunofluorescent analysis was as described previously, and samples were examined using a laser scanning confocal system (Bio-Rad MRC 1024) (17Tsukamoto T. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Chemotaxis was assayed with the modified Boyden chamber technique as described (18Tsukamoto T. Matsui T. Nakata H. Ito M. Natazuka T. Fukase M. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10143-10147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cantley L.G. Barros E.J.G. Gandhi M. Rauchman M. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F271-F280PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the lower chambers filled with serum-free DMEM containing HGF were covered with Nucleopore filters (Costar; pore diameter, 8 μm) coated with type I collagen. Then freshly trypsinized MDCK cells suspended in serum-free DMEM (5 × 105/ml) were added to the upper chamber. Protease inhibitors were added to both sides. The chambers were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2. Cells that migrated over the filter were fixed, stained, and counted under a microscope. MDCK cells (at the “cell island” stage) were pretreated with either potent proteasome inhibitors (lactacystin and MG132), neutral cysteine protease inhibitors (ALLN and E64), a calpain inhibitor (calpeptin), or inhibitors of lysosomal proteolysis (chloroquine and primaquine) for 30 min. Cells were then subjected to scattering conditions by adding either 20 ng/ml HGF or, in the case of the cells with temperature-sensitive pp60v-Src, inducing a temperature shift from the nonpermissive (40 °C) to permissive temperature (35 °C). Of the inhibitors tested, only the proteasome inhibitors could markedly inhibit cell-cell dissociation in MDCK cells during scattering driven by HGF or pp60v-Src (Fig.1). Both MG132 and the highly specific agent lactacystin, which inhibit the proteasome through different mechanisms, gave similar results. ALLN showed a weak inhibitory effect on this cell-cell dissociation consistent with the compound's weak inhibition of the proteasome (20Bush K.T. Goldberg A.L. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9086-9092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), whereas neither E64 nor lysosomal inhibitors affected scattering (data not shown). We have previously demonstrated that comparable concentrations of MG132 and ALLN inhibit the degradation of short and long-lived proteins in MDCK cells in a manner consistent with inhibition of the proteasome (20Bush K.T. Goldberg A.L. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9086-9092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that reduction of the aldehyde group in MG132, which is the key moiety of this molecule necessary for proteasome inhibition, markedly diminishes its ability to inhibit protein degradation in MDCK cells, indicating that the action of this agent is largely on the proteasome (20Bush K.T. Goldberg A.L. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9086-9092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Notably, the shape of the cell island after proteasome inhibition under scattering conditions was different from the normal cellular island: 1) cells at the margin appeared to spread into the cell-free space, resulting in the formation of long cytoplasmic protrusions, and 2) these marginal cells demonstrated extensive membrane ruffling at the cell-free side, whereas cell-cell contact was maintained with neighboring cells. To analyze the blockage of scattering by proteasome inhibitors biochemically, we sought to examine the overall amounts of TJ as well as AJ proteins in MDCK cells at the cellular island stage by Western immunoblotting (>90% of junctional proteins were dissolved in RIPA extraction buffer). As shown in Fig. 3 a, in general, the amounts of TJ as well as AJ proteins were not significantly changed after treatment with various protease inhibitors, including proteasome inhibitors, during scattering induced by HGF in MDCK cells. The most notable change was an increase of β-catenin, in which case less mobile forms accumulated in the presence of MG132, lactacystin, or ALLN; however, this increase was also found in MDCK cells treated with lactacystin alone, indicating that this change in β-catenin is not specific to the blockage of cell-cell dissociation during scattering induced by HGF in MDCK cells (Fig.2 A). Because β-catenin is known to be degraded by the proteasome through its ubiquitination (21Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar,22Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), this increase is likely to be due to an accumulation of ubiquitinated β-catenin by proteasome inhibitors. In addition, a slight increase (<20%) in levels of total α-catenin, E-cadherin, and occludin was also observed after proteasome inhibition (Fig.2 A). Similar results were obtained with temperature-sensitive v-Src MDCK cells treated with protease inhibitors at either nonpermissive or permissive temperatures (data not shown).Figure 2Total levels of TJ as well as AJ proteins and stoichiometry of ZO-1 and E-cadherin containing complexes after treatment with HGF in the presence or absence of various protease inhibitors. A, type II MDCK cells at a cellular island stage were treated with 20 ng/ml HGF in the presence or absence of cell permeable protease inhibitors (MG, 0.5 μmMG132; lac, 0.5 μm lactacystin; AN, 10 μm ALLN; cal, 20 μmcalpeptin; E64, 25 μm E64; chl, 50 μm chloroquine). Equal amounts of RIPA buffer solubilized protein (50 μg/lane) were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies specific for ZO-1, ZO-2, occludin, E-cadherin, α-catenin, and β-catenin. The arrow indicates a ubiquitinated form of β-catenin. B, MDCK cells were either treated with 20 ng/ml HGF (type II) or transferred to nonpermissive temperature (ts-v-Src) in the presence or absence of 0.5 (type II) or 2 (ts-v-Src) μm lactacystin overnight and lysed with TN buffer. The supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-ZO-1 or anti-E-cadherin antibody. The immune complexes were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE and probed with the indicated antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the stoichiometry of the individual components of the ZO-1 and E-cadherin containing complexes during scattering in the presence or absence of lactacystin, MDCK cells were lysed with TN buffer to preserve protein-protein interactions, and the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-ZO-1 or anti-E-cadherin antibody, followed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 B). No significant differences in the amounts of co-precipitating proteins in the ZO-1 or E-cadherin containing complex were observed in scattered cells induced by both HGF and pp60v-Src in the presence or absence of lactacystin. Although less mobile forms of β-catenin coprecipitated with E-cadherin, this was also found in cells treated with lactacystin alone (data not shown). Although the immunoblot analysis shown in Fig. 2 indicated that the overall protein amount of TJ as well as AJ proteins is not markedly changed in MDCK cells treated with HGF and the activation of pp60v-Src in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, this did not exclude the possibility that the subcellular localization and the cytoskeletal association of TJ and AJ proteins is affected by the treatment. To examine this possibility, we employed a Triton X-100 extraction assay in the cells (17Tsukamoto T. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). After overnight incubation with proteasome inhibitors under scattering conditions driven by HGF, cells were extracted with CSK-A buffer, which contains 0.5% Triton X-100, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 3). Indirect immunofluorescence revealed that after proteasome inhibition under scattering conditions, Triton X-100-insoluble ZO-1 was clearly detectable at the cell-cell contact site of HGF-stimulated MDCK cells treated with lactacystin (Fig. 3 d), as was the case with a integral membrane TJ protein, occludin (Fig. 3 c) (23Furuse M. Hirose T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar); these staining patterns are similar to untreated cells (data not shown) (17Tsukamoto T. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar,24Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In addition, after proteasome inhibition under scattering conditions, the transmembrane AJ protein, E-cadherin (Fig.3 g), also colocalized with α-catenin (Fig. 3 h), which links E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton via β-catenin at the lateral border of the cells (3Aberle H. Schwartz H. Kemler R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, in the absence of proteasome inhibition, the normal junctional localization of both TJ and AJ proteins, was disrupted, and these proteins lost their association with cytoskeletal elements in scattered cells, judging from immunocytochemistry of Triton X-100-insoluble junctional proteins (Fig.3, a, b, e, and f), consistent with results of others (25Pasdar M. Li Z. Marreli M. Nguyen B.T. Park M. Wong K. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 451-462PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in temperature-sensitive v-Src MDCK cells (data not shown). Immunoblot analyses of Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble (“cytoskeletal”) fractions were also consistent with the notion that proteasome inhibitors stabilized associations of TJ proteins with the cytoskeletal fraction (Fig.4 A). A significant portion of occludin and ZO-1 remained in the Triton X-100-insoluble pool in the presence of inhibitors, whereas TJ proteins became Triton X-100 soluble after scattering in the absence of the inhibitors (Fig. 4 B). The changes in solubility of these proteins became obvious after ∼4 h of HGF treatment or the activation of temperature-sensitive pp60v-Src and correlated well with cell-cell dissociation observed by light microscopy (data not shown). Moreover, the amount of a higher molecular weight form of occludin in the Triton X-100-insoluble pool, which appears to be localized at the TJ (Fig.3 c) (17Tsukamoto T. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar, 24Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), was increased by the inhibitors. The alteration of Triton X-100 extractabilities of ZO-2, E-cadherin, and α-catenin was less striking than ZO-1, occludin, and β-catenin (Fig. 4, B and C). The absolute increase in Triton X-100-insoluble β-catenin may be partly due to the total increase (Fig. 2); however, it is possible that the blockage of catenin degradation partly explains the inhibition of cell-cell dissociation upon scattering, because in addition to their key role in stabilizing the AJ (3Aberle H. Schwartz H. Kemler R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), catenins may play a role in the stabilization of the TJ (26Rajasekaran A.K. Hojo M. Huima T. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 27Watabe-Uchida M. Uchida N. Imamura Y. Nagafuchi A. Fujimoto K. Uemura T. Vermeulen S. van Roy F. Adamson E.D. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Thus, these results suggest that this blockage of cell-cell dissociation by proteasome inhibitors might stabilize not only junctional protein complexes at the cell-cell adhesion site but also prevent disruption of links between junctional proteins and cytoskeletal elements (indicated by resistance to detergent extraction). To gain further insight into the fate of junctional proteins during proteasome inhibition upon cell scattering, we used 35S-labeled temperature-sensitive v-Src MDCK cells because v-Src has less mitogenicity for MDCK cells than HGF (15Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. van Roy F. Mareel M.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). During the last 30 min of the labeling period at the nonpermissive temperature, cells were treated with MG132 or vehicle and chased for various lengths of time in normal growth medium at the permissive temperature. Immunoprecipitation from 35S-labeled cells at each time point revealed that E-cadherin is a long-lived protein: the half-life was ∼8 h at the permissive temperature (Fig.5). The proteasome inhibitor, MG132 as well as lactacystin (data not shown), significantly blocked the decrease of radiolabeled E-cadherin at the scattering temperature (Fig.5 B). We cannot exclude the possibility that those chemicals also inhibit cell proliferation (28Goldberg A.L. Stein R. Adams J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 2: 503-508Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 29Shinohara K. Tomioka M. Nakano H. Tone S. Ito H. Kawashima S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 30Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), and thereby radiolabeled E-cadherin might be diluted by newly synthesized E-cadherin molecule in the absence of the inhibitor. Nevertheless, this result supports our hypothesis that proteasomal proteolysis can alter the fate of junctional proteins upon epithelial cell scattering. Cell scattering consists of at least two biological responses, which appear to occur simultaneously or synchronously in the cells: 1) cell-cell dissociation, resulting from breaking apart of intercellular junctional complexes, and 2) cell movement, driven by rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and formation of new cell-substratum contacts (focal adhesions). To address the question of whether the proteasomal proteolytic pathway might be involved in the latter step, we examined the immunocytochemical localization of paxillin, a major component of focal adhesions (31Turner C.E. Glenney J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), upon cell scattering induced by HGF. As shown in Fig. 6 A (panel a), paxillin mainly accumulated along the edge of normal MDCK cells in cellular islands. In scattered (or scattering) cells, paxillin accumulated at cell protrusions and the membrane ruffling site (Fig.6 A, panel b). Of interest was that paxillin also accumulated at cell protrusions of marginal cells in lactacystin-treated MDCK cell islands in a distribution similar to that of scattering cells treated with HGF alone (Fig. 6 A, panel c). Moreover, a chemotaxis assay using a modified Boyden chamber technique did not reveal any effect of lactacystin, even at higher concentrations (5 μm), on cell migration toward HGF (Fig. 6 B). In agreement with a previous report (32Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 32719-32722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (337) Google Scholar), a calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, partially inhibited cell migration induced by HGF, whereas calpeptin could not block cell scattering induced by HGF and pp60v-Src (data not shown). These data suggest that the proteasomal proteolytic pathway is not critical for rearrangement of focal adhesions and cytoskeleton induced by HGF as well as cell motility in this context, but it is essential for disruption of cell-cell adhesion and intercellular junctions. To analyze cell polarity, we examined the immunocytochemical localization of Na+,K+-ATPase, which is normally present at the basolateral domain of polarized MDCK cells (33Mays R.W. Siemers K.A. Fritz B.A. Lowe A.W. van Meer G. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and gp135, a glycoprotein associated with apical microvilli of MDCK cells (34Ojakian G.K. Schwimmer R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7A (panel a), the β subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase was clearly localized at the lateral border of control MDCK cells, whereas Na+,K+-ATPase was widely redistributed in scattered cells (Fig. 7 A, panel b). In the presence of lactacystin, Na+,K+-ATPase was still found at the lateral border after HGF stimulation; however, this staining at the lateral border of the cells was weaker than in control cells, and faint diffuse intracellular staining was present (Fig.7 A, panel c). Analysis of gp135 revealed clear punctate staining characteristic of apical microvillar staining in control MDCK cells (Fig. 7, A, panel d, and B, panel a). After treatment with HGF, this punctate staining diminished significantly, and gp135 redistributed diffusely in scattered cells (Fig. 7, A, panel e, and B, panel b). Lactacystin inhibited the loss of the apical staining of gp135 (although the punctate staining was finer) on the apical surface of the cells (Fig. 7, A, panel f, and B, panel c), consistent with partial preservation of cell polarity. Because polarized epithelial cells possess a subcortical cytoskeleton that undercoats the AJ as well as TJ (35Drenckhahn D. Dermietzel R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 36Fath K.R. Mamajiwalla S.N. Burgess D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 17 (suppl.): 65-73Crossref Google Scholar), we also examined the distribution of F-actin in the cells. Phalloidin staining revealed that loss of the cortical actin bundle was largely prevented by lactacystin in HGF-stimulated MDCK cells (Fig. 7, C, panel a, and C, panel c). This structure was markedly disrupted in scattered cells (Fig. 7C, panel b). These results are consistent with the stabilization of junctional proteins at the lateral border in MDCK cells treated with proteasome inhibitors upon cell scattering (Fig. 3), because junctional complexes are tightly associated with cortical actin bundles that lie under the complexes in epithelial cells. Apical microvillar actin staining also appeared to be partly preserved but was obscured because of other alterations in the actin cytoskeleton accompanying changes in cell shape and motility. Thus, the partial preservation of cell polarity may be not only due to the blockage of cell-cell dissociation but also the preservation of cell-cell junctions and the subcortical actin cytoskeleton. It is worth noting that several junctional proteins can serve as proteasome substrates (21Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar, 37Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26399-26403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and that a deubiquitinating enzyme, Fam, has been localized to the junctional complex (38Taya S. Yamamoto T. Kano K. Kawano Y. Iwamatsu A. Tsuchiya T. Tanaka K. Kanai-Azuma M. Wood S.A. Mattick J.S. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that proteasome inhibition blocks cell-cell dissociation by HGF and pp60v-Src in MDCK epithelial cells; however, it is still unknown whether this blockage of cell-cell dissociation by proteasome inhibition affects a constitutive degradation pathway of junctional proteins or a pathway enhanced only in the context of scattering, resulting from the activation of a particular tyrosine kinase cascade. Assembly and disassembly of junctional complexes appear to involve multiple signaling pathways (7Denker B.M. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F1-F9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Stuart R.O.

Physiol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar); it is thus possible that, apart from playing a key role in the turnover of junctional proteins such as E-cadherin, the proteasome may regulate the turnover of a key protein involved in signaling. Further examination of the degradation pathway of junctional proteins will lead to a better understanding of how epithelial cell-cell contact is regulated not only under physiological and/or developmental conditions but also in disease states. We thank the members of the Nigam lab for discussion and critical reading of the manuscript."

In this report we describe the stable transfection of a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line, Panc1-MUC1, with the cDNA for mucin core 2 GlcNAc-transferase (C2GnT), which creates the core 2 β-1,6 branch in mucin-type glycans. These cells lack endogenous C2GnT activity but express a recombinant human MUC1 cDNA. C2GnT-transfected clones expressing different levels of C2GnT were characterized using monoclonal antibodies CC49, CSLEX-1, and SM-3, which recognize tumor-associated epitopes. Increased C2GnT expression led to greatly diminished expression of the CC49 epitope, which we identified as NeuAcα2,6(Galβ1,3)GalNAcα-Ser/Thr in the Panc1-MUC1 cells. This was accompanied by the emergence of the CSLEX-1 epitope, sialyl Lewis x (NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4(Fucα1,3)GlcNAc-R), an important selectin ligand. Despite this, however, the C2GnT transfectants could not bind to selectins. Increased C2GnT expression also led to masking of the SM-3 peptide epitope, which persisted after the removal of sialic acid, further suggesting greater complexity of the core 2-associated O- glycans on MUC1.

These tumor-associated epitopes are potential targets for diagnosis, imaging, and therapeutic treatment (reviewed in Refs. 1Farah R.A. Clinchy B. Herrera L. Vitetta E.S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 321-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and 2Rowlinson-Busza G. Epenetos A.A. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1992; 4: 1142-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which these epitopes arise is not well understood but may involve changes in the activity of glycosyltransferases, because carbohydrate is an essential component of many tumor-associated epitopes. Mucin-type glycan structures are influenced by both the level of expression and the Golgi localization of glycosyltransferases, which compete with one another for common acceptor structures (3Brockhausen I. Montreuil J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Schachter H. New Comprehensive Biochemistry. 29a. Elsevier Publishing Co., Inc., New York1996: 201-259Google Scholar). When competing glycosyltransferases share the same Golgi localization, the final O- glycan structure is likely to be governed primarily by the relative activities of the enzymes. However, if the enzymes reside in different Golgi compartments, the earlier Golgi enzyme will have an advantage in dictating the oligosaccharide structure. Glycosyltransferase competition can occur following the creation of the core 1 acceptor structure Galβ1–3GalNAcαSer/Thr. UDP-GlcNAc:Galβ1–3GalNAc (GlcNAc to GalNAc) β-1,6GlcNAc-transferase (C2GnT;1 EC 2.4.1.102) attaches GlcNAc in β-1,6 linkage to GalNAc of the core 1 acceptor creating the core 2 β-1,6 branch in the O- glycan chain.UDP-GlcNAc+Galβ1-3GalNAcα-Ser/Thr→C2GnTGlcNAcβ1-6\Galβ1-3GalNAcα-Ser/Thr+UDPREACTION I Creation of the core 2 branch enables the O- glycan chain to be extended into complex structures such as polylactosamine chains (reviewed in Ref. 4Dennis J.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The sialyl transferases ST6GalNAc I and II compete with C2GnT for the core 1 acceptor substrate (5Kurosawa N. Kojima N.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1402-1409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and direct the glycosylation pathway toward simpler structures lacking the core 2 branch, such as NeuAcα2,6(Galβ1,3)GalNAc and NeuAcα2,6GalNAc. The latter structures are recognized by the monoclonal antibody CC49 (7Hanisch F.-G. Uhlenbruck G. Egge H. Peter-Katalinic J. Biol. Chem.

C2GnT activity is regulated under certain growth conditions, including maturation of granulocytes (9Fukuda M. Carlsson S.R. Klock J.C. Dell A. J. Biol.

The importance of C2GnT in vivo was recently shown in a study of mice in which the C2GnT gene was deleted from the germ line (23Ellies L.G. Tsuboi S. Petryniak B. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Marth J.D. Immunity. 1998; 9: 881-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Leukocyte interactions with selectins and endothelial cells were impaired, leading to a weakened inflammatory response. The mucin MUC1 is a type I membrane-bound glycoprotein, which is aberrantly glycosylated in many cancer tissues (reviewed in Ref. 24Ho S.B. Kim Y.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1991; 2: 389-400PubMed Google Scholar), displaying several tumor-associated epitopes. For example, monoclonal antibodies SM-3 and HMFG-2 recognize peptide epitopes within the MUC1 tandem repeat region and react preferentially with MUC1 in cancer tissues (25Burchell J. Gendler S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Girling A. Lewis A. Millis R. Lamport D. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5476-5482PubMed Google Scholar, 26Girling A. Bartkova J. Burchell J. Gendler S. Gillett C.

Cancer. 1981; 28: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) where aberrant glycosylation results in epitope exposure. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of C2GnT on the expression of certain MUC1 tumor-associated epitopes. We stably transfected the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line Panc1-MUC1, which expresses a recombinant human MUC1 cDNA, with a bovine C2GnT cDNA. We found that increased expression of C2GnT resulted in de novo expression of the sLex epitope. However, this did not render the cells capable of binding selectins. C2GnT expression also led to the elimination of the CC49 epitope. Furthermore, the SM-3 and HMFG-2 tumor-associated MUC1 peptide epitopes were masked by high levels of C2GnT expression. In summary, introduction of C2GnT into a cancer cell line significantly altered the expression of MUC1 tumor-associated epitopes by shifting the mucin-type glycosylation pathway toward more complex O- glycans. This suggests a potential regulatory role for C2GnT in the generation of tumor-associated epitopes. The Panc1 cell line was purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). S2–013 is a subline of a human pancreatic tumor cell line derived from a liver metastasis (28Burdick M.D. Harris A. Reid C.J. Iwamura T. Hollinsworth M.A. J. Biol.

Immobilon P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Bond Elut C18 cartridges were from Varian (Sunny Vale, CA). M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was from Kodak IBI. CC49 monoclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. David Colcher at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. CSLEX-1 monoclonal antibody was obtained from the ATCC. HMFG-2 and SM-3 monoclonal antibodies were gifts of Dr. Sandra Gendler at the Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ. C2GnT monoclonal antibody B5–1 was obtained as described (31Li C.-M. Adler K.B. Cheng P.-W.

Other chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Panc1 and Panc1-MUC1 cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). Panc1-MUC1 cells stably transfected with C2GnT cDNA were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 300 μg/ml Zeocin. A 1.6-kilobase fragment of bovine C2GnT cDNA (containing the complete open reading frame of C2GnT) (31Li C.-M. Adler K.B. Cheng P.-W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1/Zeo+ (Invitrogen) using Kpn I and Not I. Transfection of pcDNA 3.1-C2GnT into Panc1-MUC1 cells was performed using a transferrin-assisted lipofection protocol as described previously (32Cheng P.-W. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and clones, which stably express C2GnT, were selected based on resistance to the antibiotic Zeocin. Enzyme assays were carried out on total cell homogenates prepared by washing confluent monolayers of the cells twice with cold PBS, scraping the cells off the flask in 0.25 m sucrose, and disrupting the cells by successive passage of the sucrose suspension through 18-, 20-, and 25-gauge syringe needles. Protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as standard. All assays were conducted at least in duplicate under conditions in which product formation was linear with respect to time and enzyme amount. An additional reaction without exogenous acceptor was performed to measure endogenous enzyme activity. Enzyme activity was calculated by subtracting endogenous activity from total activity and was expressed as nmol of sugar donor transferred/hour/mg protein. GalNAc TF, which catalyzes the attachment of GalNAc in α-linkage to serine or threonine of the mucin peptide, was assayed as described (33Nishimori I. Johnson N.R. Sanderson S.D. Perini F.

Core 1 GalTF, which catalyzes attachment of galactose in β-1,3 linkage to GalNAcα-Ser/Thr, was assayed as described (29Cheng P.-W. Bona S.J. J. Biol.

ST6GalNAc I, which catalyzes attachment of neuraminic acid in α-2,6 linkage to GalNAc in GalNAcα-Ser/Thr and Galβ1–3GalNAcα-Ser/Thr (6Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Lee Y.-C. Nakaoka T. Kojima N. Tsuji S.

Proc. 1980; 39: 2002Google Scholar) using aOSM as acceptor. ST6GalNAc II, which catalyzes attachment of neuraminic acid in α-2,6 linkage to GalNAc in Galβ1–3GalNAcα-Ser/Thr (but not in GalNAcα-Ser/Thr) (5Kurosawa N. Kojima N. Inoue M. Hamamoto T. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19048-19053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was assayed as described (35Cheng P.-W. Moeller S.L. Boat T.F. Fed. Proc. 1980; 39: 2002Google Scholar) using FPDG as acceptor. FPDG also acts as an acceptor for ST6GalNAc I and ST3Gal I, and therefore care must be taken in interpreting assay results using this acceptor. ST3Gal I, which catalyzes attachment of neuraminic acid in α-2,3 linkage to Gal of Galβ1–3GalNAcα-Ser/Thr (36Rearick J.I. Sadler J.E. Paulson J.C. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4444-4451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was measured in the same manner as ST6GalNAc I and II, except Galβ1–3GalNAcα-Bzl was used as acceptor. ST6GalNAc I and II cannot utilize Galβ1–3GalNAcα-Bzl as acceptor (5Kurosawa N. Kojima N. Inoue M. Hamamoto T. Tsuji S. J. Biol.

Confluent cells were washed twice with cold PBS and scraped from culture flasks in lysis buffer (500 μl for a T25 flask) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100, using a rubber cell scraper. Following a 40-min incubation on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 min in a microcentrifuge to pellet cell debris. Supernatant was then transferred to a new tube and stored at −20 °C. Cell lysates (300 μg of total protein) prepared as described above were treated with 100 milliunits of Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase in a total volume of 200 μl for 3.5 h at 37 °C in 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5. One-third of the neuraminidase-treated lysates was exposed to 1 unit of peptide N-glycosidase F in 200 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, at 37 °C for 18 h. Another third of the neuraminidase-treated lysates was treated with 10 milliunits of Diplococcus pneumoniae β-galactosidase in 200 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, at 37 °C for 44 h. Samples were stored at −20 °C after treatment prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and Western blotting or lectin blotting. For Western blot analysis of MUC1 and C2GnT, proteins in cell lysates were resolved by 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (with 3% polyacrylamide stacking gels) and 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (with 6% polyacrylamide stacking gels), respectively. Protein was electroblotted to Immobilon P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane overnight at 300 mA, then blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TBS (0.9% NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5) at room temperature for 1 h. The MUC1 blots were then probed for 1 h at room temperature with various primary antibodies in 5% nonfat milk in TBS, whereas the C2GnT blot was probed with the C2GnT antibody B5–1 diluted 1:2500 in TBS, 1% BSA. Membranes were then washed 15 min in 5% nonfat milk in TBS (for MUC1 blots) or TBS, 1% BSA (for C2GnT blots) followed by two additional 5-min washes with fresh wash mixtures. The membranes were then exposed for 1 h at room temperature to peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG/IgM secondary antibody diluted 1:2000 in 5% nonfat milk in TBS (for MUC1 blots) or TBS, 1% BSA (for C2GnT blots). Washes were repeated as described above, and then ECL reagents (Pierce) were applied per the manufacturer's instructions; the blots were then exposed to ECL-sensitive film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins in whole cell lysates were resolved by 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (with 3% polyacrylamide stacking gels). Protein was electroblotted to Immobilon P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane overnight at 300 mA and blocked in 2% BSA (fraction V) in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. The blots were probed for 1.5 h at room temperature with biotin conjugates of either DBA or PNA 1:500 in TBT (TBS + 0.1% BSA + 0.025% Tween 20). Membranes were washed three times, 5 min each, in TBT. Next, the membranes were exposed for 1 h at room temperature to peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin diluted 1:1000 in TBT. Washes were repeated as described above. ECL reagents were applied as per the manufacturer's instructions, and the blots were exposed to ECL-sensitive film. 500 μl of Panc1-MUC1 C2#5 total cell lysate was incubated with 200 μl of antibody HMFG-2 at 4 °C with mild agitation for 3 h. Protein G-Sepharose (150 μl) was then added, and the mixture was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with mild agitation. The immunoprecipitate was washed three times with 1 ml of cold PBS. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer was added, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min; the supernatant was resolved on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. S2–013 cells and Panc1-MUC1 C2#7 cells were grown to approximately 90% confluence and released from the tissue culture flask by incubation for 30–60 min in PBS containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 0.1% BSA. Aliquots containing 5 × 105 cells were pelleted in wells of a 96-well plate and washed with staining medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide). The cells were then stained for 1 h on ice with IgM-conjugated P-, E-, or L-selectin in staining medium with or without 5 mm EDTA added. Cells were washed twice with staining medium (with or without 5 mm EDTA, as appropriate) and stained 1 h on ice in the dark with 10 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-human IgM in staining medium (with or without 5 mmEDTA, as appropriate). Cells were washed twice with staining medium and fixed for 10 min in 2% formaldehyde. The cells were resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan or FACStarPlus. MUC1-transfected Panc1 (Panc1-MUC1) cells were chosen as the host for stable transfection of C2GnT because this cell line lacks endogenous C2GnT expression but expresses core 1 Gal TF, which creates the acceptor substrate utilized by C2GnT. These cells also express a recombinant human MUC1 bearing a FLAG epitope (Fig. 1), which provides for ease of detection and purification of the MUC1. Furthermore, MUC1 in the Panc1-MUC1 cells has been previously characterized with a panel of antibodies recognizing specific carbohydrate antigens and was found to express the tumor-associated epitope recognized by CC49 (28Burdick M.D. Harris A.

Following transfection of the C2GnT cDNA into Panc1-MUC1 cells, stable clones were isolated and screened for expression of C2GnT. Three clones representing a wide range of C2GnT expression (Fig.2) were chosen for characterization of the effects of C2GnT on MUC1. The three clones displayed an approximate 40-fold difference in C2GnT activity between the high expressing (C2#7) and low expressing (C2#5) clones (Fig. 2 A). C2GnT expression levels in the clones assayed via Western blotting gave results consistent with those of the C2GnT enzyme assays (Fig.2 B). The presence of the core 2 branch in mucin-type glycans has been implicated in the generation of the sLex epitope (13Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Sullivan F.X. Cumming D. Blood. 1996; 88: 3872-3879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether expression of C2GnT in Panc1-MUC1 cells could generate the sLex epitope. Immunoblotting with CSLEX-1, which recognizes sLex(NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc-R) (17Fukushima K. Hirota M. Terasaki P.I. Wakisaka A. Togashi H. Chia D. Suyama N. Fukushi Y. Nudelman E. Hakomori S.-I. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5279-5285PubMed Google Scholar), revealed that the sLex epitope was not present in Panc1-MUC1 parental cells or in the low C2GnT-expressing clone C2#5. However, the epitope appeared in clones C2#14 and C2#7, which have higher C2GnT expression (Fig. 3 A). MUC1 expression levels in the clones varied little (Fig. 3 B), showing that the changes in sLex detection were not because of different amounts of MUC1 in the samples. Because we detected sLex on MUC1 in the high C2GnT-expressing transfectants, we tested these clones for their ability to bind to P-, E-, and L-selectins using IgM-selectin fusion proteins followed by staining with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-IgM secondary antibody and subsequent flow cytometry analysis. Despite the presence of the sLexepitope, no binding of the C2GnT transfectants to the selectins was detectable under conditions in which the positive control cell line, S2–013, was found to bind to the selectins (data not shown). Because CC49 can recognize both NeuAcα2,6(Galβ1,3)GalNAc and NeuAcα2,6GalNAc (7Hanisch F.-G. Uhlenbruck G. Egge H. Peter-Katalinic J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,8O'Boyle K.P. Markowitz A.L. Khorshidi M. Lalezari P. Longenecker B.M. Lloyd K.O. Welt S. Wright S.E. Hybridoma. 1996; 15: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we sought to identify which of these was present on MUC1 in the Panc1-MUC1 parental cells, as detected previously by Burdick et al. (28Burdick M.D. Harris A. Reid C.J. Iwamura T. Hollinsworth M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24198-24202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We performed lectin blotting using DBA and PNA on Panc1-MUC1 cell lysates treated or untreated with neuraminidase. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 1 and 2, PNA reacted intensely with MUC1 in neuraminidase-treated lysate, whereas DBA showed no reaction. Because DBA is specific for α-linked GalNAc, whereas PNA recognizes Galβ 1–3 GalNAc, these results strongly suggest the presence of Galβ 1–3 (NeuAc α 2–6) GalNAc, rather than sialyl Tn (NeuAcα 2–6GalNAc), on MUC1 in the Panc1-MUC1 parental cells. To rule out the possibility that the structure recognized by PNA is located on asparagine-linked glycans on MUC1 rather than on mucin-type glycans, we treated desialylated lysate with peptide N-glycosidase F to remove N-linked chains. No change was seen in the intensity of PNA recognition (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 3), confirming that the recognized structure is present on O- glycans. Finally, because PNA can react with terminal β1,4-linked galactose in addition to Galβ 1–3 GalNAc, we treated desialylated lysate with D. pneumoniae β-galactosidase, which cleaves β-1,4-linked galactose (but not β-1,3-linked galactose). Once again, no change was seen in PNA recognition (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 4), further supporting Gal β-1–3GalNAc as the structure recognized by PNA. From these results, we conclude that the structure detected by CC49 in the Panc1-MUC1 parental cells consists mainly of the trisaccharide Gal β-1–3 (NeuAcα 2–6) GalNAc. This conclusion is supported by our detection of substantial core 1 GalTF enzyme activity in Panc1 cells (Table I), which synthesizes Galβ-1–3GalNAc.Table IGlycosyltransferase activities in Panc1 and Panc1-MUC1 C2#7 cellsEnzymeAcceptor usedLinkage catalyzedSpecific activityPanc1Panc1-MUC1 C2#7nmol/h/mg proteinGalNAc TFMUC2 peptide1-aSee “Experimental Procedures” for the sequence of MUC2 acceptor peptide.GalNAcα ⑧ Ser/Thr25.026.6Core 1 Gal TFaOSMGalβ1,3 ⑧ GalNAc-Ser/Thr14.113.8ST3Gal IGalβ1,3GalNAc-BzlNeuAcα2,3 ⑧ Galβ1,3GalNAc-Bzl1.11.2ST6GalNAc IaOSMNeuAcα2,6 ⑧ GalNAc-Ser/Thr0.70.7ST6GalNAc IIFPDGNeuAcα2,61.71.7↘Galβ1,3GalNAc-Ser/Thr1-bThe linkage shown is that catalyzed by ST6GalNAc II using FPDG.

To understand the function of AML1 during B cell differentiation, we analyzed regulatory regions of B cell-specific genes for potential AML1-binding sites and have identified a putative AML1-binding site in the promoter of the B cell-specific tyrosine kinase gene, blk. Gel mobility shift assays and transient transfection assays demonstrate that AML1 binds specifically to this site in the blk promoter and this binding site is important for blk promoter activity. Furthermore, in vitro binding analysis revealed that the AML1 runt DNA-binding domain physically interacts with the paired DNA-binding domain of BSAP, a B cell-specific transcription factor. BSAP has been shown previously to be important for B cell-specific regulation of the blk gene. Physical interaction of AML1 with BSAP correlates with functional cooperativity in transfection studies where AML1 and BSAP synergistically activate blk promoter transcription by more than 50-fold. These results demonstrate physical and functional interactions between AML1 and BSAP and suggest that AML1 is an important factor for regulating a critical B cell-specific gene, blk.

The β subunit of PEBP2/CBF is also involved in a chromosomal inversion, inv (16Wang Q. Stacy T. Binder M. Marin-Padilla M. Sharpe A.H. Speck N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

T(12;21) is a common chromosomal abnormality in childhood pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (20Golub T.R. Barker G.F. Bohlander S.K. Hiebert S.W. Ward D.C. Bray-Ward P. Morgan E. Raimondi S.C.

Chan G.C. Pui C.H. Grosveld G. Downing J.R. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 1985-1989PubMed Google Scholar). This translocation generates two chimeric genes, TEL/AML1 and AML1/TEL. Only the TEL/AML1 chimeric gene product is consistently detected in cells with t(12;21) (23Hiebert S.W. Sun W. Davis J.N. Golub T. Shurtleff S. Buijs A. Downing J.R. Grosveld G. Roussell M.F. Gilliland D.G. Lenny N. Meyers S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1349-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The TEL/AML1 chimeric gene expresses a fusion protein that contains the 333 NH2-terminal amino acids of the TEL protein encoding the Pointed dimerization domain but lacking the Ets DNA-binding domain, and almost the entire AML1 protein, including the AML1 DNA-binding domain. Therefore, the TEL/AML1 fusion protein can interact with AML1 DNA-binding sites and possibly interfere with AML1 function during B cell differentiation. This indicates that AML1 may play an important role in controlling gene expression during normal B cell differentiation. To study the function of AML1 in B-cell differentiation, we analyzed regulatory regions of B cell-specific genes for the presence of AML1-binding sites. We observed a consensus AML1-binding site in the promoter of the blk gene. BLK, a Src family member, encodes a B cell-specific, 55-kDa protein tyrosine kinase p55Blk(24Dymecki S.M. Niederhuber J.E. Desiderio S.V. Science. 1990; 247: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). BLK is associated with the B cell antigen receptor and is involved in signal transduction events (25Burkhardt A.L. Brunswick M. Bolen J.B. Mond J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7410-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The B cell antigen receptor complex is formed by membrane IgM noncovalently associated with heterodimers of B29 and mb-1 (26Lin J. Justement L.B. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1548-1555PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mason D.Y. Van Noesel C.J. Cordell J.L. Comans-Bitter W.M. Micklem K. Tse A.G. Van Lier R.A. Van Dongen J.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2753-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Antigen cross-linking to the B cell antigen receptor leads to a rapid and transient increase in tyrosine kinase activity resulting in activation of several signal transduction pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The antigen receptor does not itself contain an intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain; therefore, tyrosine kinase activation is due to signal transduction mediated through interaction of two B cell antigen receptor-associated proteins, Igα (mb-1) and Igβ (B29) with the cytoplasmic Src-like kinases, BLK, LYN, and FYN (28Reth M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 97-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This rapid and transient activation of tyrosine kinases triggers a cascade of downstream events, leading to changes in gene expression and either cell proliferation and differentiation or apoptosis. BLK is exclusively expressed in B cells at the pro-B, pre-B, and mature B cell stages, but not in plasma cells or non-B cells (29Dymecki S.M. Zwollo P. Zeller K. Kuhajda F.P. Desiderio S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4815-4823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of BLK in B cell antigen receptor signaling is not clear, although several studies have implicated the BLK kinase in antigen receptor cross-linking mediated growth arrest and apoptosis (30Yao X.R. Scott D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7946-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Yao X.R. Scott D.W. Immunol. Rev. 1993; 132: 163-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, transgenic mice expressing a constitutively activated BLK mutant in the B cell lineage develop B lymphoid tumors (32Malek S.N. Dordai D.I. Reim J. Dintzis H. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7351-7356Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, control of blk gene expression could be directly related to B cell development and neoplasia. B cell specificity of blk gene expression is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level and a 320-bp1 promoter region of the murine blk promoter appears to contain most of the B cell-specific regulatory elements (29Dymecki S.M.

It has been reported that B cell-specific activator protein (BSAP/Pax5) binds to the blk promoter, and recently BSAP as well as NF-κB were shown to transactivate the blk promoter (33Zwollo P.

BSAP belongs to the paired box (Pax) gene family, which plays an important role during the development of the central nervous system and during B cell development (35Barberis A. Widenhorn K.

We now report that AML1 binds to a functionally important region of the blk promoter, directly interacts with the paired box DNA-binding domain of BSAP protein through its runt homology domain, and cooperates with BSAP in activating blk promoter transcription. The probe for the EMSA was a double-stranded oligonucleotide with bp −47 to −28 of the blk upstream region (Fig. 1). A 32P-labeled probe was prepared by T4 kinase phosphorylation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). Nuclear protein for the EMSA was prepared from Ba/F3 cells according to the method published by Schreiber et al. (44Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3910) Google Scholar). Approximately 0.5 ng of probe was incubated with 5 μg of nuclear protein or 1 μl of in vitro translated protein in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 12% glycerol at 4 °C for 20 min (45Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Chen H.M. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 373-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All reactions contain 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). Reactions were electrophoresed at 10 V/cm on a 6% polyacrylamide gel (bisacrylamide/acrylamide ratio = 1:29) in 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. For supershift experiments, 1 μl of polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against a 17-amino acid NH2-terminal peptide from AML1 was added to the binding reaction mixture 10 min prior to addition of the probe (46Meyers S. Downing J.R. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6336-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). A murine blk promoter (bp −191 to +136) DNA fragment was subcloned into the Kpn I and Xho I sites of the pXP2 luciferase reporter gene construct to form pBlk-luc (47Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Best J. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5091-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). pBlk-luc(mAML1), which contains a mutation at the AML1 binding was generated using QuickChange Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The AML1 site was changed from TGTGGT to TGCACT. AML1 and CBFβ expression constructs, pCMV5-AML1 and pCMV5-CBFβ, were received from Dr. Scott Hiebert (46Meyers S. Downing J.R. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6336-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). BSAP cDNA was received from Dr. Steve Desiderio (33Zwollo P. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15310-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into the Not I site of the pCI expression vector. The GST-BSAP full-length fusion protein was generated by inserting a blunt-ended Not I fragment of the BSAP cDNA into the Sma I site of pGEX-5X-3. GST-BSAP1–312 and GST-BSAP1–159 were generated by deleting a Sma I-Xho I fragment or a Sac II-Xho I fragment from the carboxyl terminus of GST-BSAP, respectively. GST-BSAP234–391 was generated by inserting a Pvu II-Not I fragment of BSAP into Bam HI (blunt ended) and Not I sites of pGES-5X-3. Full-length AML1, AML11–208, and AML187–208were as reported previously (48Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Meyers S. Rhoades K.L. Larson C.J. Chen H.M. Hiebert S.W. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human B cell line BJA-B, promonocytic cell line THP-1, and murine B cell line Ba/F3 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine. THP-1 cell culture medium contained 2 × 105m2-mercaptoethanol. Ba/F3 cell culture medium also contained 10% conditioned WEHI-3B medium as a source for interleukin-3. Maintenance and transfection of CV-1 cells were as described previously (48Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Meyers S. Rhoades K.L. Larson C.J. Chen H.M. Hiebert S.W. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BJA-B and Ba/F3 cells were transfected by electroporation in RPMI 1640 medium at 960 microfarads and 220 or 270 V, respectively. Cells were harvested 5 h after transfection. Rous sarcoma virus-human growth hormone expression construct was co-transfected with luciferase reporter constructs for normalizing transfection efficiency (45Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Chen H.M. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 373-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein in vitro translation was performed with TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). The TnT lysate contains approximately 150 μg/μl endogenous protein. Each in vitro translation reaction uses 25 μl of TnT lysate in a 50 μl of reaction. The GST-pull down experiments were as described previously (49Petrovick M.S. Hiebert S.W. Friedman A.D. Hetherington C.J. Tenen D.G. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3915-3925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TEL/AML1 fusion protein is associated with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Since the TEL/AML1 protein has lost the Ets DNA-binding domain of TEL, but still contains the intact AML1 DNA-binding domain, this fusion protein could possibly generate leukemia by interfering with the function of normal AML1 or other PEBP2/CBF family members in the activation of critical B cell developmental genes. Therefore, we searched the regulatory regions of several B cell-specific genes for putative AML1-binding sites and found an AML1 binding consensus sequence “TGTGGT” in the B cell-specific blk promoter at bp −39 to −34, just downstream of the BSAP-binding site (Fig. 1). In addition to the putative AML1 site we also detected putative binding sites for several other transcription factors including three putative Ets-binding sites and a helix-loop-helix protein-binding site (Fig. 1). To test whether AML1 can interact with the blk promoter, oligonucleotides containing the AML1 consensus sequence from the blk promoter were used in EMSA experiments with nuclear extracts from the B cell line, Ba/F3, or with in vitro translated AML1. As shown in Fig.2 A, Ba/F3 nuclear extract formed a specific protein-DNA complex with the blk promoter bp −47 to −28 oligonucleotide. This protein-DNA complex was specifically competed by unlabeled self-oligonucleotide or an oligonucleotide encoding the Moloney murine leukemia virus enhancer PEBP2/CBF-binding site (50Wang S.W. Speck N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), but not by an unlabeled non-PEBP2/CBF binding oligonucleotide. These data suggested that this complex contains a PEBP2/CBF related protein. To further characterize this protein, antiserum raised against the NH2-terminal region of one of the PEBP2/CBF family members, AML1 (46Meyers S. Downing J.R. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6336-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), was used in the EMSA analysis. Upon the addition of the anti-AML1 antiserum, the specific protein-DNA complex was drastically reduced and a supershifted band was detected indicating that the protein in Ba/F3 cell nuclear extracts interacting with the blk promoter AML1 site is either identical with AML1 or closely related. Additional EMSA analysis demonstrated that in vitro translated AML1 formed a complex with the same radiolabeled blk promoter probe (Fig. 2B). These results clearly demonstrate that PEBP2/CBF transcription factors, such as AML1, can interact specifically with the blk promoter AML1 site. To determine whether the AML1-binding site is functionally relevant for blk promoter activity, the AML1 site was mutated from TGTGGT to TGCACT in the blk promoter luciferase construct to generate pBlk(mAML1)-luc. As shown in Fig.3 A, transient transfection into the B cell line BJA-B demonstrated that the blk gene upstream region from bp −191 to +136 has strong promoter activity as previously shown (33Zwollo P. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15310-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 25-fold increase in luciferase expression was observed in comparison to the promoter-less luciferase construct pXP2. Mutation of the AML1-binding site in the blk promoter reduced the promoter activity to 67% when compared with the wild type promoter. Furthermore, the same mutation also reduced the promoter activity to a similar level in another B cell line, Ba/F3. This indicates that the AML1-binding site in the blk promoter is a functionally relevant site, although not absolutely essential. To test whether AML1 can indeed transactivate the blk promoter, co-transfection experiments were performed in CV-1 cells with expression vectors for AML1 and its heterodimer partner CBFβ. As shown in Fig. 3 B, exogenous AML1 together with CBFβ expression increases transcription of the wild type blk promoter-luciferase construct by 7-fold. Mutation of the AML1-binding site reduced transactivation of the blk promoter by AML1/CBFβ to less than 2-fold. These data together with the results from the DNA-protein interaction studies demonstrate that AML1 or a related family member plays a significant role in B cell-specific regulation of the blk promoter. As shown in Fig. 1, the AML1-binding site is relatively close to the transcription initiation site of the blk gene. Six base pairs upstream of the AML1 site is a region that has been identified as a BSAP-binding site (33Zwollo P. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15310-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,34Zwollo P. Rao S. Wallin J.J. Gackstetter E.R. Koshland M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18647-18655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). BSAP is a B cell-specific activating protein, which is a critical transcription factor for B cell-specific gene expression and B cell development. Since AML1 has been shown to interact and cooperate with other transcription factors, and the AML1 site is adjacent to the BSAP-binding site, we analyzed whether AML1 can cooperate with BSAP in regulating blk gene expression. First, we studied their physical interaction using GST-pull down assays, in which Escherichia coli expressing GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with in vitro translated 35S-labeled proteins. As shown in Fig.4 A, in vitro translated full-length AML1 can be specifically retained on agarose beads containing the fusion protein made from BSAP (GST-BSAP), but not on glutathione beads containing only GST. This result indicates that AML1 can physically interact with BSAP. To analyze this interaction in more detail, DNA constructs containing only the NH2-terminal portion of AML1 (a.a. 1–208) or the AML1 runt homology domain (a.a. 87–208) were in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]methionine. As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, both peptides can specifically interact with GST-BSAP fusion protein, but not GST protein alone. These results indicate that the runt homology domain of AML1 is responsible for the interaction with BSAP. To determine which domain of BSAP is responsible for its interaction with AML1, GST-fusion proteins containing COOH-terminal deletion mutants of BSAP were used in the binding reactions. Removal of the carboxyl terminus up to a.a. 312 did not have any effect on AML1 interaction (Fig. 4 E, lane 3). The BSAP NH2-terminal portion (a.a. 1–159) containing the paired DNA-binding domain retained the interaction with AML1 as well (Fig.4 E, lane 4). In contrast, GST-fusion protein containing only the BSAP COOH-terminal portion (a.a. 234–391) did not show any interaction with AML1. These results demonstrate that AML1 can directly interact with BSAP and this interaction is through the runt homology domain of AML1 and the paired domain of BSAP (6Kagoshima H. Shigesada K.

Both AML1-binding site mutation analysis and transactivation analysis indicate that AML1 is an important transcription factor for blk promoter activity (Fig. 3). BSAP has been shown to be a critical regulator of blk promoter activity (33Zwollo P. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15310-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zwollo P. Rao S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18647-18655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and data in Fig. 4 have demonstrated the physical interaction between these two transcription factors. To determine whether physical interaction between AML1 and BSAP is associated with functional cooperativity in activating blk gene expression, we performed co-transactivation experiments in monkey kidney CV-1 cells as shown in Fig. 5. In the presence of only the parental expression vector (control), luciferase expression directed by the blk promoter is ∼2-fold over the promoter-less construct. When BSAP was used alone in the transactivation experiments, there was an 8-fold induction of blk promoter activity. AML1 together with its heterodimer partner CBFβ activated the blk promoter 12-fold. When all three transcription factors, BSAP, AML1, and CBFβ were used in the same transactivation experiment, blk promoter activity was induced by 51-fold. These results demonstrate a strong transcriptional synergy of blk promoter activity in the presence of all three factors, indicating that physical interaction between AML1 and BSAP leads to functional cooperativity in the context of the blk promoter. AML1 is a transcription factor identified by studying t(8;21) associated acute myeloid leukemia (1Miyoshi H. Shimizu K. Kozu T. Maseki N. Kaneko Y. Ohki M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10431-10434Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 52Rowley J.D. Semin. Hematol. 1990; 27: 122-136PubMed Google Scholar, 53Erickson P. Gao J. Chang K.S. Look T. Whisenant E.

Cytogenet. 1992; 63: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The function of AML1 in hematopoiesis has been demonstrated by analyzing its role in regulating the expression of critical hematopoietic genes and by studying AML1 null mice (55Tenen D.G. Hromas R. Licht J.D. Zhang D.E. Blood. 1997; 90: 489-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4025-4039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AML1 knockout mice die during embryogenesis with the block of definitive hematopoiesis (16Wang Q. Stacy T. Binder M. Marin-Padilla M. Sharpe A.H. Speck N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3444-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 17Okuda T. van Deursen J. Hiebert S.W. Grosveld G. Downing J.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that AML1 plays an important role during early hematopoietic progenitor cell formation. AML1 binds to the regulatory elements of genes specifically expressed in different lineages of hematopoietic cells or of genes important for lineage development. Recently, AML1 has been found to associate with a chromosomal translocation, t(12;21), commonly associated with B-cell lineage differentiation, indicating an important role for AML1 during B cell development (20Golub T.R. Barker G.F. Bohlander S.K. Hiebert S.W. Ward D.C. Bray-Ward P. Morgan E. Raimondi S.C. Rowley J.D. Gilliland D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4917-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 22Shurtleff S.A. Buijs A. Behm F.G. Rubnitz J.E. Raimondi S.C. Hancock M.L. Chan G.C. Pui C.H. Grosveld G. Downing J.R. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 1985-1989PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, only one potential B cell-specific target gene for AML1, the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancer (57Erman B. Cortes M. Nikolajczyk B.S. Speck N.A. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1322-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), has been identified to date. Therefore, we decided to search for other potential target genes for AML1 in B cells. We identified a putative AML1-binding site in the promoter region of the B cell-specific blk gene and tested the potential role of AML1 in B-cell specific blk gene regulation. We provide strong evidence here that AML1 directly interacts with a functionally important region of the blk promoter and transactivates the promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AML1 physically interacts with another critical B-cell transcription factor BSAP and synergizes with BSAP in regulating blk promoter activity. There are different alternatively spliced forms of AML1, which have been named as AML1 (AML1a), AML1A (AML1b), and AML1B (AML1c). In this paper, we used “AML1” to include different forms of the AML1 protein. AML1B was used in the transactivation and in vitro transcription reactions. AML1 is a member of the CBF protein family. All three α subunits of the CBF family contain the highly conserved runt homology domain, which encodes the DNA-binding domain. Therefore, all three α subunits recognize the same “TGTGGT” DNA sequence. Previous studies by others have identified different members of the CBFα protein in B cell lines and a B cell-enriched tissue spleen, using antibodies specifically against three different CBFα subunits. Their results show that AML1 and AML2 are expressed at similar levels in B lineage cells; AML3 is not detectable (58Meyers S. Lenny N. Sun W. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 303-312PubMed Google Scholar). The AML1 antiserum that we used in Fig. 2 is raised against the AML1 NH2-terminal 17 amino acids. The NH2-terminal region is conserved between all three CBFα proteins. Since both AML1 and AML2 are expressed at similar levels in B cells and both AML1 and AML2 have a similar DNA binding activity (58Meyers S. Lenny N. Sun W. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 303-312PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that both of them are in the supershifted protein-DNA complex as shown in Fig. 2. It has been reported previously that CBFβ enhances AML1 binding to DNA (3Wang S. Wang Q. Crute B.E. Melnikova I.N. Keller S.R. Speck N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3324-3339Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and CBFβ-AML1 forms a slower mobility shifted band with DNA than AML1-DNA complex (46Meyers S. Downing J.R. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6336-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, in vitro translated AML1 binds to DNA and addition of CBFβ enhances the binding of AML1 with the DNA. However, we did not detect an obvious slower mobility complex. This is probably due to the lack of a particular modification in the in vitro translation system that is required for forming a stable complex of a heterodimer CBF protein with DNA, or the specific experimental conditions do not favor the formation of the complex during gel electrophoresis. Mutation of the AML1 site in the blk promoter significantly reduced promoter activity. However, this mutation did not abolish the promoter activity, indicating that AML1 is an important factor for the promoter activity. Other transcription factors that bind to the blk promoter could also contribute to the promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 1, besides the AML1-binding site, there are several other potential transcription factor-binding sites including a binding site for the B cell-specific BSAP transcription factor just upstream of the AML1 site. BSAP has been reported previously to play a crucial role in the regulation of the blk promoter (33Zwollo P. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15310-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zwollo P. Rao S. Wallin J.J. Gackstetter E.R. Koshland M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18647-18655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed whether AML1 and BSAP could interact with each other and whether there is any synergy between these two factors in promoter activation. The results from GST-pull down assays demonstrated a strong interaction between these two factors, and the interaction is between the AML1 runt homology domain and the BSAP NH2-terminal paired domain. The original function of the runt homology domain includes direct binding to DNA and formation of heterodimers with CBFβ. There have been reports about AML1 physically interacting with other transcription factors through the runt homology domain, including Ets-1, PU.1, and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein family members (14Giese K. Kingsley C. Kirshner J.R. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 48Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Meyers S. Rhoades K.L. Larson C.J. Chen H.M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3915-3925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the paired domain of BSAP has been shown to be involved in protein-protein interactions with members of the Ets family (59Fitzsimmons D. Hodsdon W. Wheat W. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2198-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The interaction between AML1 and BSAP represents a new class of interaction between AML1 and other transcription factors. Interestingly, it is the DNA-binding domain that is involved in the interaction of both transcription factors. It will be interesting to further study the specific amino acids involved in the different interactions. The interaction and synergy between Ets-1 and AML1 is crucial for the enhancer function of several T cell receptor genes (14Giese K. Kingsley C. Kirshner J.R. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar,60Wotton D. Ghysdael J. Wang S. Speck N.A. Owen M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 840-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar); furthermore, the interactions and synergies between AML1 and PU.1 (49Petrovick M.S. Hiebert S.W. Friedman A.D. Hetherington C.J. Tenen D.G. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3915-3925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Myb (61Britos-Bray M. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell.

Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been demonstrated to serve critical functions during activation of myeloid specific gene expression. Both AML1 and BSAP are critical regulators of hematopoiesis (16Wang Q. Stacy T. Binder M. Marin-Padilla M. Sharpe A.H. Speck N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3444-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 17Okuda T. van Deursen J. Hiebert S.W. Grosveld G. Downing J.R.

Hiebert S.W. Ward D.C. Bray-Ward P. Morgan E. Raimondi S.C. Rowley J.D. Gilliland D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4917-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 63Busslinger M.

The interaction and synergy between AML1 and BSAP could play a significant role in B cell-specific gene expression and disruption of this interaction due to chromosomal translocations or other chromosomal abnormalities could play a critical role in B cell transformation.

https://openalex.org/W1985103276,"The nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) catalyzes the oxidation of l-arginine to l-citrulline and NO through consumption of oxygen bound to the heme. Because NO is produced close to the heme and may bind to it, its subsequent role in a regulatory mechanism should be scrutinized. We therefore examined the kinetics of NO rebinding after photodissociation in the heme pocket of human endothelial NOS by means of time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. We show that geminate recombination of NO indeed occurs and that this process is strongly modulated by l-Arg. This NO rebinding occurs in a multiphasic fashion and spans over 3 orders of magnitude. In both ferric and ferrous states of the heme, a fast nonexponential picosecond geminate rebinding first takes place followed by a slower nanosecond phase. The rates of both phases decreased, whereas their relative amplitudes are changed by the presence ofl-Arg; the overall effect is a slow down of NO rebinding. For the isolated oxygenase domain, the picosecond rate is unchanged, but the relative amplitude of the nanosecond binding decreased. We assigned the nanosecond kinetic component to the rebinding of NO that is still located in the protein core but not in the heme pocket.

The implications for a mechanism of regulation involving NO binding are discussed. nitric-oxide synthase endothelial NOS tetrahydrobiopterin singular value decomposition maximum entropy method The enzyme nitric-oxide synthase (NOS)1 has been identified in mammals as three different isoforms, which have been cloned and expressed (1Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar, 2Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Although it is inducible in macrophages, the two other forms are constitutive in neurons and in endothelial cells. Its presence was also recently demonstrated in liver mitochondria (3Tatoyan A. Giulivi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11044-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). NOS isoforms catalyze the formation of highly diffusible NO and are involved in several physiopathologic events (4Ignarro L.J. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1996; 55: S2-S5PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cooke J.P. Dzau V.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 489-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 6Marin J. Rodriguez-Martinez M.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 75: 111-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For instance, hypertension is associated with a deficiency of NO production, whereas excessive amounts of NO lead to hypotension. For blood pressure regulation, NO released from eNOS acts as an intermediate messenger in endothelial cells, targeting the enzyme guanylyl cyclase (7Garbers D.L. Lowe D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30741-30744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is activated and catalyzes the production of cGMP from GTP. NOS catalyzes the oxidation of l-Arg tol-citrulline through O2 consumption to produce NO in presence of NADPH, tetrahydrobiopterin, FAD, FMN, and Ca2+-calmodulin (8Stuehr D.J. Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F.

The NOS structure is organized in two distinct domains, a reductase domain that binds FMN and FAD and an oxygenase domain that harbors the heme (iron-protoporphyrin IX) for O2 ligation. The triggering role of calmodulin has been explained by a switch mechanism between the reductase and oxygenase domains mediating electron transfer from, respectively, NADPH to FAD, to FMN, and then to the heme (11Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 12Matsuoka A. Stuehr D.J. Olson J.S. Clark P. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25062-25066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oxygenase domain can be expressed separately in an active form that binds cofactors (14Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14631-14635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The formation of NO occurs in two steps and requires two molecular O2 and 1.5 equivalent of NADPH (8Stuehr D.J. Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Griffith O.W. Feldman P.L. Wiseman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6259-6263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Klatt P. Schmidt K. Uray G. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14781-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-Hydroxy-l-arginine is generated in the first stage of reaction and is subsequently further oxidized to the final products l-citrulline and NO. It has been shown by isotopic substitution that the nitrogen atom of NO comes from the NOH group of the intermediate N-hydroxy-l-arginine (8Stuehr D.J. Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Griffith O.W. Feldman P.L. Wiseman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6259-6263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proposed reaction mechanisms involve the formation of a transient Fe2+ species before O2 ligation and a Fe3+ one in the last step when l-citrulline and NO are formed (15Klatt P. Schmidt K. Uray G. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14781-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Clague M.J. Wishnok J.S. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14665-14673Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Several isoform-selective inhibitors of NOS are analogs ofl-Arg with a modified guanidinium group such as propyl-l-Arg (17Zhang H.Q. Fast W. Marletta M.A. Martásek P. Silverman R.B. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 21: 3869-3870Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar) or aminoguanidine (18Garvey E.P. Oplinger J.A. Furfine E.S. Kiff R.J. Lazlo F. Whittle B.J. Knowles R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4959-4963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), which may interfere with other l-Arg-utilizing enzymes. Because NOS possesses several cofactors and binds three substrates for NO synthesis, it may be regulated in different ways. This regulation is essential because NO is a very reactive species that cannot be stored. For therapeuthics purposes, a detailed study of the regulation of the isoforms is of prime importance because inhibiting or enhancing the activity of one isoform without perturbing the others can be beneficial. A possible mechanism of regulation is through self-inhibition; although the NOH group from which NO is derived may not directly interact with the heme during oxidation of N-hydroxy-l-arginine, NO is released in close vicinity of the heme, and its subsequent binding to the heme must therefore be considered. Indeed, a 2-fold increase of the catalytic activity of the inducible murine NOS has been reported when oxy-hemoglobin, a NO scavenger, is present during the reaction cycle (19Hurshman A.R. Marletta M.A Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but this effect was not observed for the constitutive murine neuronal NOS (20Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Fukuto J.M. Ignarro L.J. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22997-23006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It was shown that NO decreased nNOS activity (21Rogers N.E. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and that a ferric-nitrosyl complex formed during catalytic activity in the case of inducible NOS (19Hurshman A.R. Marletta M.A Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) as well as a ferrous-nitrosyl complex formed independently of exogenous NO concentration during activity of nNOS (20Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Fukuto J.M. Ignarro L.J. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22997-23006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Such observations are not yet reported for eNOS. Furthermore, the presence of NO scavengers such as oxyhemoglobin or superoxide did not increase the activity of nNOS, nor did they preclude the formation of the nitrosyl complex. Because the use of NO scavengers allows investigation only of diffusion controlled mechanisms of inhibition, these observations suggest that two phases occur in self-inhibition of nNOS by NO, one of which involves a fast step in which NO binds to the heme right after synthesis, before diffusing out of the heme pocket. We addressed this issue at a molecular dynamics level by using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy, which powerfully relates structural properties and dynamical behavior. This is a particularly well suited technique because it allows simulation, by means of photodissociation, of the release of newly synthesized NO in the heme pocket. To follow the behavior of released NO and the parameters influencing the heme-NO interaction, we analyzed the rebinding of NO to eNOS after photolysis in both ferric and ferrous states of the heme and in the presence or absence of the substratel-arginine. l-Citrulline was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). l-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arginine was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (specific activity, 77 Ci/mmol). (6 R)-5,6,7,8-Tetrahydro-l-biopterin (BH4) was obtained from Research Biochemical International. Gas was purchased from Alphagaz. All other chemicals used for purifications or spectroscopy were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human eNOS and oxygenase domain of eNOS were prepared using the baculovirus expression system. The BH4-depleted eNOS was expressed in Escherichia coli. Expression and purification of recombinant proteins were essentially the same as described previously (14Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14631-14635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22Berka V. Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33293-33300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme preparations were stored at liquid nitrogen in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.15 mNaCl. NOS activity was assayed by measuring conversion of l-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline (13Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25062-25066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μm calmodulin, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 μm β-NADPH, 10 μm BH4, 100 μml-arginine, and 1 μCi ofl-[3H]arginine was incubated with enzyme at 37 °C for 3 min. The BH4 content of purified eNOS and its oxygenase domain were measured as described previously (13Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25062-25066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and quantitated from a standard curve of authentic BH4. The BH4 stoichiometry was determined to be 0.5–0.6 mol of BH4/mol of protein in eNOS and 0.3 mol of BH4/mol of oxygenase domain, respectively. After thawing, 100 μl of eNOS (60 μm) were put in a 1-mm optical path quartz cell sealed with a rubber stopper and immediately degassed with at least five cycles of vacuum and purging with argon (99.9999%). When indicated, 8 μl of 60 mml-Arg were added using a gas-tight syringe (Hamilton) previously rinsed with argon (final concentration, 5 mm; KD ofl-Arg for eNOS is 2 μm). This addition of solution balanced the change of volume because of vacuum evaporation of water. For preparing NO-liganded ferric eNOS, pure NO (99.99%) was directly applied in the cell through the gas train at a total pressure of 1.3 bar (about 2 mm of NO in the aqueous phase). A second stopper was placed on the cell. Equilibrium spectra were recorded at each step of the process. For reduction of l-Arg bound eNOS, 5 μl of a 20 mm β-NADPH solution, degassed under vacuum and argon, were added to the sample (final concentration, 1 mm; [NADPH]/[heme] = ∼17). No calmodulin was added. To get NO-liganded ferrous eNOS, 0.5% NO (diluted in nitrogen; total pressure, 1.3 bar) was introduced in the cell yielding a NO concentration of 10 μm in the aqueous phase. This avoids reoxidation of the heme because of high concentration of NO (23Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10512-10516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The evolution of the Soret band was then monitored. In early experiments we tried sodium dithionite for reducing eNOS, but this appeared not suitable for time-resolved spectroscopy because we observed a photoinduced depletion of NO because of a reaction between NO and sodium dithionite. The ferrous nitrosyl complex in the absence ofl-arginine was too labile (24Migita C.T. Salerno J.C. Masters B.S. Martásek P. McMillan K. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10987-10992Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Abu-Soud H.M. Wu C. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3777-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) for time-resolved measurements and was not exploited further. Horse heart myoglobin (80 μm) was prepared from lyophilized powder (Sigma) dissolved in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and reduced with sodium dithionite. Time-resolved spectroscopy was performed with the pump-probe laser system previously described (26Martin J.-L. Vos M.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 199-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Photodissociation of NO was achieved with an excitation wavelength in the α band, either at 563 or at 580 nm with a pulse width of 40 fs. The transient absorption after a variable delay was probed with a wide spectrum pulse from a continuum, whose group velocity dispersion was minimized at 413 nm by means of prisms. The same sample quartz cell (1-mm optical path length) was used for recording equilibrium spectra and for kinetic measurements; it was continuously moved perpendicularly to the laser beams during the recording. The absorbance of samples was in the range 0.5–0.8 at Soret maximum for 1 mm, and the temperature was 18 °C. Time windows of 20 and 300 ps were scanned. 20–60 scans were recorded and averaged. Nanosecond kinetics were recorded in separate measurements by means of the same set up as picosecond kinetics, to maintain the same duration and spectrum of the pulses, while extending the total length of the delay line. In this case the dwell time was 6 s at each point, and 8–12 scans were averaged. Analysis of the data was performed by singular value decomposition (SVD) of the time-wavelength matrix (27Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1988: 51-62Google Scholar), and the kinetics associated with the SVD component having the highest singular value were fit with a minimum number of exponential components. It was not necessary to take into account the pulse shape because it is 1 order of magnitude shorter than time increment between two transient spectra. An additional analysis of the kinetics was performed using the maximum entropy method (MEM) to obtain the distribution of rates (28Bretthorst G.L. Skilling J. Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Methods. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1989: 377-388Crossref Google Scholar, 29Steinbach P.J. Chu K. Fraunfelder H. Johnson J.B. Lamb D.C. Nienhaus G.U. Saub T.B. Young R.D. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recording of NO-liganded reduced myoglobin kinetics was performed under the same conditions. The equilibrium spectra of unliganded and NO-liganded species of eNOS are displayed together with the difference spectra in Fig.1. When NOS is unliganded, the Soret maximum is located at 398 nm for the oxidized form and at 412 nm for the NADPH-reduced form. Upon ligation of NO, the maximum is shifted to 441 and 434 nm for ferric and ferrous eNOS, respectively. The difference spectrum (Fig. 1 A) for ferric eNOS discloses a characteristic minimum at 443 nm (shifted by 2 nm with respect to the maximum of NO-liganded eNOS Soret band). The Soret shift induced by NO binding is the opposite of that observed for histidine-coordinated iron proteins such as myoglobin or hemoglobin. When l-Arg is added to the ferric form (Fig. 1 B), there is a slight shift from 398 to 395 nm, providing evidence for a modification of the heme electronic state. The transient spectra (raw data) are shown in Fig.2. Each of them corresponds to the calculated difference between a spectrum at the indicated time and the spectrum before photodissociation. For ferric eNOS alone, the transient spectra at all time points (Fig. 2, top panel) showed a minimum at the same position as the equilibrium spectrum (443 nm) corresponding to the photodissociation of NO. From 8 ps to 4 ns, the transient spectra have the same shape and exhibit a decreasing intensity because of rebinding of NO. The 2-ps spectrum has an isosbestic point around 423 nm slightly shifted by about 2 nm with respect to that of the longer time spectra. This is the only feature showing the presence of an intermediate before the rebinding of NO to the ferric ground state species. When l-Arg is bound to ferric eNOS, the transient spectrum at 2 ps discloses absorption maxima centered at 415 and 465 nm. The isosbestic point moves from 428 nm at 2 ps to 423 nm at 4 ns, and the second isosbestic point, which was constant at 467 nm in the absence of l-Arg, is greatly displaced from 455 nm at 2 ps to 465 nm at 4 ns in the presence ofl-Arg. These features are not observed in the case of ferric eNOS alone, whereas they are more pronounced in the 2-ps transient difference spectrum of l-Arg-bound and NADPH-reduced eNOS, indicating that the photodissociated excited state heme is different when the substrate l-Arg is bound. For ferrous eNOS, the amplitude of the transient difference spectra at 4 ns remains high, indicating a long-lived component. In all three conditions, the 8-ps to 4-ns spectra correspond to rebinding without contribution from transient excited species. To disentangle the contributions from the different transient species and their associated kinetics, we performed SVD analysis of the raw data. The 300-ps and the 4-ns time windows were recorded sequentially, and SVD analysis were performed separately. This resulted in two main spectral components displayed in Fig. 3and compared with the equilibrium unliganded minus NO-liganded difference. Although a SVD spectral feature does not necessarily correspond to a particular chemical species, it does in this present case; for the three species, the spectral component having the highest singular value (SVD1) matches the deligandation difference equilibrium spectrum. The associated kinetics displayed in Fig.4 thus represent the evolution of unliganded ground state eNOS and the subsequent rebinding of NO. In all cases this SVD component had the same spectrum in both time windows, which were therefore fit simultaneously to obtain kinetic parameters describing the overall spectral evolution. According to the physiological function of eNOS, the release of a certain amount of NO is expected to occur, and we thus needed a constant term for fitting the kinetics for the three conditions. The minimal model that we used for describing the kinetics of unliganded ground state species and NO rebinding has up to three exponential decay components and a constant term. The decay components and constant term are associated with the same transient species, which is similar to the liganded-unliganded difference equilibrium spectrum (Fig. 3) having identical positions for minimum and isosbestic points. Therefore, these kinetic components represent different phases of NO rebinding for the three species. The parameters of the fits are listed in TableI.Figure 4A, normalized kinetics of NO rebinding associated with the first SVD spectral component in two time windows. In all cases, the transient spectra associated with these decays match those of unliganded minus NO-liganded eNOS equilibrium difference spectra. The parameters of fit are listed in Table I.

Open table in a new tab The model used for fitting consists of a sum of exponentials and a constant term. See Fig. 4. In all cases a 5-ps rise was also present in the kinetics (not shown) associated with the SVD2 spectral component (Fig. 3) and is assigned to the formation of unliganded ground state species from the excited state. This component produced the change of isosbestic point near 423 nm seen in the raw spectra (Fig. 2) at 2 ps. The early time photophysics of eNOS heme will be discussed elsewhere. The fit of kinetics associated with the SVD1 spectrum revealed three decay components and a constant (Fig. 4 and Table I) whose associated spectra are shown in Fig. 3 A. The fast decay (τ1 = 15 ps) and the intermediate one (τ2 = 200 ps) are two phases of the recombination with NO still located in the heme pocket, as seen for other hemoproteins, and represent together 37% of the total rebinding. The long time component (τ3 = 2 ns) represents a rebinding phase of NO not necessarily located in the heme pocket. The constant term of 10% relative amplitude may be due either to a much longer time rebinding or to NO diffusing into the solution. About 34% of the photodissociated NO has rebound after 300 ps and 85% after 4 ns (Fig. 4). When l-Arg is bound, the fit of kinetics also resulted in three decay terms. The SVD2 component has a spectrum quite different from that obtained in the absence of l-Arg (Fig. 3 B), especially around 460 nm, and is the origin of the conspicuous shift of isosbestic point from 455 to 465 nm in the raw spectrum (Fig. 2 B). Compared with free eNOS, the presence of l-Arg increased the time constant of the fast NO-rebinding to 53 ps (Table I) and its relative amplitude 4-fold. Simultaneously, the amplitude A2 of the intermediate rebinding phase was decreased 2-fold, whereas the long time constant increased dramatically to τ3 = 17 ns (it may also contain a constant term). Along with the increase of A1, l-Arg binding resulted in the crossing of the normalized kinetics. The change of τ1 and τ2 is seen in the first time window (Fig. 4), whereas that of τ3 is evident in the second time window. About 36% of NO rebound after 300 ps and 50% after 4 ns. Thus the overall effect of l-Arg is a greatly reduced rate of recombination, whereas the phases are differently affected. Importantly, there is no spectral SVD component (Fig. 3 B) matching the difference spectrum of l-Arg deligation from eNOS (Fig. 1 B); therefore we readily concluded that photodissociation of l-Arg did not occur and that rebinding of NO occurred when l-Arg remained bound. This also holds true for ferrous NOS. For preparing ferrous eNOS we did not add calmodulin prior to adding NADPH. After reduction with NADPH the equilibrium spectrum discloses a Soret located at 412 nm, characteristic of unliganded reduced eNOS, similar to that obtained with sodium dithionite, which can reduce heme without calmodulin. Subsequent addition of NO shifted the Soret maximum of the NADPH-treated sample to 434 nm, again identical to that of eNOS reduced with sodium dithionite, and is clearly not the position for the NO complex of ferric eNOS (441 nm). A residual amount of calmodulin carried along the eNOS purification appears to sustain electron transfer from FMN to the heme (30Presta A. Liu J. Sessa W.C. Stuehr D.J. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because the reduction using NADPH may not lead to a full reduction of NOS (19Hurshman A.R. Marletta M.A Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we expected that this sample contained an amount of unliganded oxidized heme, the absorption band of which is hidden by that of NADPH. The affinity for NO is higher for ferrous than for ferric eNOS (KD is 65 μm and ∼nm for ferric and ferrous form, respectively 2V. Berka and A.-L. Tsai, unpublished results.), and we used a NO concentration of 0.5% in the gas phase; this gave an aqueous NO concentration too low for binding to ferric eNOS. Thus the fraction of the remaining ferric eNOS that is NO-liganded is negligible, and the NO rebinding kinetics is only due to ferrous eNOS. This is not true for the kinetics of excited states (SVD2 spectral component), which may be a mixture of contributions from both oxidized and reducedl-Arg-bound species. As seen for the ferric eNOS, the NO rebinding proceeds with three exponential decays. The time constant of fast geminate rebinding decreased slightly for ferrous eNOS (τ1 = 36 ps) compared with ferric eNOS (τ1 = 53 ps). Interestingly, the relative amplitude of the picosecond components, associated with NO rebinding still located in heme pocket, decreased, whereas that of the long one increased (τ3 = 18 ns, A3= 0.63). The multiple phases have time constants quite similar to those of l-Arg-bound ferric eNOS (Table I), but the general trend is a slightly slower rebinding than for ferric eNOS. Because the combination of exponential values obtained from the fits are one of the most probable set, but not the unique solution, we analyzed the kinetics by another method: the MEM (28Bretthorst G.L. Skilling J. Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Methods. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1989: 377-388Crossref Google Scholar), which enables a better estimate of the uncertainty of the kinetic components. We obtained a rate distribution a (k) (Fig.4 B) for the three NO-liganded species. For the ferric NOS, three peaks are separated from each other by 1 order of magnitude (5 × 10−2, 5 × 10−3, and 5 × 10−4 ps−1) corresponding to the exponential lifetimes for ferric eNOS in Table I, and the amplitude a (k) tappers off at rates slower than 10−4 ps−1, indicating the completeness of rebinding in this case. The relative amplitudes a (k) of the rates match those of the components Ai. Fo"
https://openalex.org/W2090111472,"p21Cip1, first described as an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, has recently been shown to have a function in the formation of cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes and in their nuclear translocation. The dual behavior of p21Cip1 may be due to its association with other proteins. Different evidence presented here indicate an in vitro and in vivo interaction of p21Cip1 with calmodulin: 1) purified p21Cip1 is able to bind to calmodulin-Sepharose in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and this binding is inhibited by the calmodulin-binding domain of calmodulin-dependent kinase II; 2) both molecules coimmunoprecipitate when extracted from cellular lysates; and 3) colocalization of calmodulin and p21Cip1 can be detected in vivo by electron microscopy immunogold analysis. The carboxyl-terminal domain of p21Cip1 is responsible for the calmodulin interaction, since p21145–164 peptide is also able to bind calmodulin and to compete with full-length p21Cip1 for the calmodulin binding. Because treatment of cells with anti-calmodulin drugs decreases the nuclear accumulation of p21Cip1, we hypothesize that calmodulin interaction with p21Cip1 is important for p21Cip1, and in consequence for cyclin D-Cdk4, translocation into the cell nucleus. p21Cip1, first described as an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, has recently been shown to have a function in the formation of cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes and in their nuclear translocation.

Both proteins were first described as inhibitors of cyclin D-Cdk4, cyclin E-Cdk2, and cyclin A-Cdk2. But recently, using knockout cell lines for each one of them and double knockout, a role for p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 in cyclin D-Cdk4 assembly and nuclear translocation has been proposed (17La Baer J.

CaM is a Ca2+-binding protein and acts as transducer of the intracellular Ca2+ signal. When bound to Ca2+, CaM is able to bind to other proteins (CaM-binding proteins) and regulate their activity (24Klee C. Vanaman T. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 213-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 25James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem.

Lopez G.A. Bachs O. Agell N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33279-33286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Takuwa N. Zhou W. Kumada M. Takuwa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 138-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that CaM regulates nuclear translocation of Cdk4 and cyclin D1 (14Taules M. Rius E. Talaya D. Lopez G.A. Bachs O. Agell N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33279-33286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This regulation may be mediated by a CaM-binding protein present in the complex, as suggested by the fact that Cdk4 and cyclin D1 from cellular lysates both bind in a Ca2+-dependent manner to CaM-Sepharose. We show here that bacterially expressed and purified p21Cip1, but not p27Kip1, is able to bind specifically to CaM and that CaM is essential for the accumulation of p21Cip1 in the nuclei of proliferating cells. NRK cells were made quiescent by growing to confluence in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% FCS and then kept for 3 days in the same medium but with only 0.5% FCS. To allow reentry to the cell cycle, quiescent cells were trypsinized and subcultured at a lower density in fresh medium supplemented with 5% FCS. Namalwa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured at 1 × 106cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described elsewhere (32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 421-466Google Scholar). Cells (5–10 × 107) were lysed in 1 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). 3–5 mg of protein from the lysates was incubated with 5 μg of polyclonal anti-p21Cip1 (sc-397, Santa Cruz), 5 μg of monoclonal anti-p21Cip1 (0P64, Calbiochem), or 5 μg of monoclonal anti-CaM for 2 h at 4 °C. As a control, an equal amount of a monoclonal nonrelated antibody or 1 μl of normal rabbit serum was used. Protein immunocomplexes were then incubated with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (for the polyclonal antibodies) or protein G-Sepharose (for the monoclonal antibodies) for 1 h at 4 °C, collected by centrifugation, washed three times in buffer A, and solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by electrophoresis and Western blotting. A cell lysate was always loaded in the same gel as a control for the mobility of each protein. All recombinant proteins were obtained as GST fusion proteins: p27Kip1-GST was obtained by digesting pET21a-p27 (gift of Dr. Massagué, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York) with Nde I-Xbo I and ligating into pGEX-KG (33Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar); cyclin D1-GST was obtained by digesting pET3d-cyclin D1 (34Xiong Y. Connolly T. Futcher B. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 65: 691-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) with Nco I-Hin dIII and ligating into pGEX-KG; p21Cip1-GST was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of pBS-hp21 (gift of Dr. Massagué, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York) and cloning into pGEX-KG in Nde I-Xbo I sites; Cdk4-GST was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a B-cell cDNA library using a forward initial primer and a reverse terminal primer and cloning into pGEX-KG in Bam HI-Hin dIII sites. GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 pLysE Escherichia coli strain and purified by gluthatione-Sepharose chromatography. CaM was purified from bovine brain, as described elsewhere (35Guerini D. Krebs J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15172-15177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CaM and p21145–164 peptide were bound to BrCN-activated Sepharose 4B, as indicated by the manufacturer. For CaM-Sepharose pull-downs, 1 μg of purified protein was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of CaM-Sepharose (1:1 v/v) or Sepharose alone in a buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing either 1 mm EGTA or 0.1 mm CaCl2. After centrifugation, unbound proteins were collected and bound proteins washed three times with buffer B and eluted directly with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Laemmli loading buffer, electrophoresed, and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting. For peptide competition experiments, CaM-Sepharose was preincubated with 2 nmol of the peptides in 200 μl of buffer B (containing only 50 mm NaCl) for 1 h at 4 °C. To determine binding of CaM to p21145–164 peptide, 1 μg of purified CaM was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of p21145–164-Sepharose (1:1 v/v) or Sepharose alone in buffer B (containing 400 mm NaCl) containing either 1 mm EGTA or 0.1 mm CaCl2. After centrifugation, unbound protein was collected and bound protein washed three times with buffer B (last wash with 100 mm NaCl) and eluted directly with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Laemmli loading buffer, electrophoresed, and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining. Proteins were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels essentially as described (38Harper J.W. Adami G. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis the proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to Immobilon-P strips for 2 h at 60 V. In the case of CaM analysis 2 mm EGTA was added in the loading buffer, and in the stacking and resolving gel solutions, transfer was for 1 h at 60 V, and Immobilon-P was then treated with 0.2% glutaraldehyde in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) for 45 min and washed twice in TBS. The sheets were preincubated in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% defatted milk powder for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% BSA, and 0.5% defatted milk powder containing antibodies against: Cdk4 (sc-260-R, Santa Cruz, 0.5 μg/ml ), cyclin D (06–450, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., 2 μg/ml), p21Cip1 (sc-397, Santa Cruz, 2 μg/ml), and p27Kip1 (1:500 dilution; gift from Dr. Massagué, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York) polyclonal antibodies or CaM monoclonal antibody. After washing in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (three times, 10 min each), the sheets were incubated with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the sheets were washed twice in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and once in TBS and the reaction visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To study colocalization of p21Cip1 and CaM, NRK cells were grown on transwell filters. Small pieces of the filters were cryofixed by protection against a copper block cooled by liquid nitrogen (−196 °C) using a Cryoblock (Leica) according to description (36Escaig J. J. Microsc. 1982; 126: 221-229Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Freeze-substitution was performed in a homemade cryosystem (37Quintana C. Micron. 1994; 25: 63-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), using acetone containing 0.5% of uranyl acetate, for 3 days at −90 °C. At day 4 the temperature was slowly increased, 5 °C/h, to reach −50 °C. At this temperature the samples were rinsed in acetone and were infiltrated and embedded in Lowicryl HM20 as follows: 50% Lowicryl in acetone for 4 h, 75% Lowicryl in acetone overnight, 100% Lowicryl overnight and 100% fresh resin for 4 h. After infiltration the resin blocks were made and polymerized with UV lamps. Ultra-thin sections were picked up on Formvar-coated gold grids in order to carry out the immunocytochemical labeling. To study colocalization Cdk4 or cyclin D1 with CaM-pelleted cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde and 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 1 h at room temperature, dehydrated according to the PLT technique (progressive lowering temperature) and embedded in Lowicryl K4M. Ultra-thin sections were mounted in Formvar-carbon-coated gold grids and processed for immunocytochemical labeling as follows. After two 10-min washes with PBS (140 mm NaCl, 5 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2), grids were incubated for 5 min with blocking solution (0.02 m glycine, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA in PBS) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the same solution containing either anti-Cdk4, anti-CycD1, or anti-p21Cip1 polyclonal antibodies (1:50 dilution) together with anti-CaM monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution). After washing, grids were incubated 1 h at room temperature with the same solution but containing gold-coupled secondary antibodies (1:35, British BioCell). Following that grids were sequentially washed with 0.1% BSA in PBS (10 min), PBS (5 min), and distilled water (30 min). Finally samples were contrasted with 2% acetate uranyl in water during 30 min (samples processed by conventional PLT) or 5 min (samples processed by slam freezing method). For p21Cip1 staining, cells grown in coverslips were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde/PBS (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2) for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere, with the specific polyclonal antibody anti-p21Cip1 (sc-397, Santa Cruz, 20 μg/ml). Coverslips were then washed three times (5 min each) in PBS and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (dilution 1:100, Sigma). After two washes in PBS, coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol (Calbiochem) and observed in a confocal microscope. We had shown previously that Cdk4 and CycD1 from cellular lysates could bind to CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner. To determine whether one of the known proteins of the Cdk4-CycD1 complex was able to bind directly to CaM, we tested the binding of bacterially expressed and purified Cdk4-GST, CycD1-GST, p27Kip1-GST and p21Cip1-GST to CaM-Sepharose. Pull-down experiments were performed as indicated in the methods and demonstrate that p21Cip1-GST bound to CaM-Sepharose in the presence of Ca2+ but not in its absence (Fig.1). CycD1-GST and p27Kip1-GST, however, were found only in the fraction not bound to the column either in the presence or in the absence of Ca2+, and a small amount of Cdk4-GST was bound to the CaM-Sepharose in the presence of Ca2+. Preincubation of CaM-Sepharose with 2 nm (total volume 200 μl) of the CaM-binding domain of the CaMKII (CaMKII290–309 fragment) inhibited the binding of p21Cip1-GST to CaM, indicating that p21Cip1-GST association with CaM was specific (Fig.2 B).Figure 2Analysis of the CaM-binding domain of p21Cip1. A, scheme of the different known binding and functional domains of p21Cip1 and sequence of the different peptides analyzed for the ability to bind to CaM. Cyc, cyclin-binding domain; cdk, Cdk-binding domain; PCNA, PCNA-binding domain; NLS, putative nuclear localization signals. B, competition assay with the three p21Cip1 peptides and with the CaM-binding domain of CaM-dependent kinase II (CaMKII290–309). CaM-Sepharose was preincubated with the different peptides in the presence of Ca2+, as indicated under “Experimental Procedures,” and then 1 μg of p21Cip1 was added and incubated for 1 h in the same buffer. The resin was washed and the amount of bound p21Cip1 analyzed by Western blotting. A control was done in the presence of EGTA in the buffer and no peptide added. C, CaM binding to p21145–164 peptide. p21145–164peptide was covalently bound to Sepharose 4B and CaM was incubated with this resin in the presence of either Ca2+ or EGTA as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Unbound CaM was collected and, after extensive washing, bound CaM was eluted with an SDS-containing buffer. CaM present in both fractions was analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining. A control of CaM binding to Sepharose 4B alone in the presence of Ca2+ (Seph) was also performed. Purified CaM was also loaded in the same gel (CaM).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine which domains of p21Cip1 could be involved in CaM interaction, three different peptides of the p21Cip1molecule (Fig. 2 A) were synthesized and assayed for competition in the p21Cip1 binding to CaM-Sepharose. As shown in Fig. 2 B, preincubation of CaM-Sepharose with 2 nmol of the p21145–164 peptide (total volume 200 μl) inhibited the binding of p21Cip1, while the other peptides had no effect. To further test that this peptide was the CaM-binding domain of p21Cip1, the peptide was covalently bound to Sepharose and pull-down experiments with purified CaM performed in the presence or absence of free Ca2+. As shown in Fig.2 C, CaM was able to bind to p21145–164-Sepharose, and the binding was Ca2+-dependent. The association between p21Cip1 and CaM was also analyzed by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3). When lysates from Namalva cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-CaM monoclonal antibody, p21CIP1 was detected by Western blotting in the immunoprecipitates. Equally, CaM was detected in the immunoprecipitates using monoclonal anti-p21Cip1antibodies. Interestingly, no CaM was found to coimmunoprecipitate with p21Cip1 when the antibodies used were the polyclonal anti-p21Cip1 directed against the carboxyl terminus of the p21Cip1 molecule (data not shown). To support the hypothesis that interaction of CaM with p21Cip1 could have a physiological role, in vivo colocalization was analyzed by double immunogold labeling. Cryofixation of proliferative activated NRK cells was achieved by slam freezing and, as indicated under “Experimental Procedures,” samples were incubated with anti-CaM monoclonal antibody and anti-p21Cip1 polyclonal antibody and processed for electron microscopy. As shown in Fig.4 A, aggregates of CaM and p21Cip1 were detected in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. Colocalization of Cdk4 and cyclin D1 in the cell nucleus with CaM was also observed in samples processed by PLT method (Fig.4 B). To analyze whether, as for cyclin D1 and Cdk4, CaM was essential for nuclear accumulation of p21Cip1, the anti-CaM drug W13 (15 μg/ml), or the control drug W12 (15 μg/ml), was added to NRK cells 5 h after proliferative activation. After 2 h of incubation with the drugs, p21Cip1 intracellular distribution was analyzed by immunocytochemistry. As shown in Fig. 5, W13 addition caused a decrease in the nuclear staining for p21Cip1 compared with the control drug, in parallel with an increase in the cytoplasmic staining. Similar results were obtained with other anti-CaM drugs such as J8 (7 μg/ml), W7 (10 μg/ml), or calmidazolium (5 μm) (data not shown). Although association of p21Cip1 with Cdk4-cyclin D1 complexes has been described in a great variety of cells, its role in the regulation of Cdk4 activity is still controversial. While an inhibitory role was first proposed (38Harper J.W. Adami G. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar, 39Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3171) Google Scholar), recently it has been shown that this association is necessary for Cdk4-cyclin D1 assembly and its nuclear translocation (17La Baer J.

The diverse functionality of this protein may depend on the number of molecules bound to each Cdk4-cyclin D complex or to the association with other regulatory proteins. We show here that CaM binds to p21Cip1 and so may be one of the molecules regulating its activity. Evidence for this is as follows: 1) purified p21Cip1 is able to bind in vitro to CaM; 2) both molecules coimmunoprecipitate when extracted from cell lysates; and 3) colocalization of CaM and p21Cip1 can be detected in vivo by electron microscopy immunogold analysis. On the contrary, although Cdk4 and cyclin D1 coimmunoprecipitate (14Taules M. Rius E. Talaya D. Lopez G.A. Bachs O. Agell N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33279-33286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and colocalize by electron microscopy with CaM, when purified, they do not bind (cyclin D1) or bind very little (Cdk4) to CaM. This indicates that their association with CaM depends on another protein. Interestingly, p27Kip1, which has some structural similarity to p21Cip1, is clearly not a CaM-binding protein. This points to a different regulation of p21Cip1and p27Kip1 functions. Interaction domains of p21Cip1 with Cdks and cyclins reside in the amino-terminal half of the molecule (Cyc 21–26; Cdk 49–71). These regions are precisely the ones well conserved between p21Cip1 and p27Kip1. The second half of the molecule contains diverse nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif (139–142, 160–163, 140–162, 141–158), the PCNA binding site (124–164), and a cyclin A inhibitory binding domain (Fig.1 C) (40Lin J. Reichner C. Wu X. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1793-1796Google Scholar, 41Chen J. Saha P. Kornbluth S. Dynlacht B.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). In order to analyze the possible binding domain of p21Cip1 to CaM, three different peptides were synthesized and assayed for their ability to compete for the binding to CaM. Among the peptides analyzed, the one corresponding to amino acids 145–164 prevented the binding of p21Cip1 to CaM. Furthermore CaM was able to bind to a p21145–164peptide-Sepharose column in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This peptide contains basic and hydrophobic residues that, plotted in a helical wheel diagram, show an amphipathic distribution. Thus, this region corresponds most probably to the CaM-binding domain of p21Cip1. This sequence is not present in the p27Kip1 molecule, in agreement with the results presented which show that p27Kip1 does not bind to CaM. As mentioned above, apart from the inhibitory role of p21Cip1 in Cdk-cyclin complexes, it has also been shown that p21Cip1 is important for the assembly of Cdk4-cyclin D1 and for its translocation to the cell nucleus (17La Baer J.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar) showed that cells transfected with a truncated p21Cip1 containing the amino-terminal half of the molecule were able to form complexes with Cdk4 and cyclin D1, but these were not found in the cell nucleus. This suggested that p21Cip1provides the nuclear localization signal for the nuclear import of the complex. Interestingly, in p21−/p21− cells Cdk4 and cyclin D1 were found in the nucleus, most probably because p27Kip1 was then able to bind to Cdk4 and cyclin D1 and provide the NLS signal. In double p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 knockouts the number of cells with nuclear Cdk4 and cyclin D1 was greatly reduced (18Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Our finding that functional inhibition of CaM during G1 inhibited nuclear accumulation of p21Cip1 opens the possibility that binding of CaM to p21Cip1 exposes an NLS of p21Cip1, so allowing its nuclear translocation. Previous results showing that CaM inhibition was also blocking nuclear accumulation of Cdk4-cyclin D1(14), lead us to suggest that CaM, through the binding to p21Cip1, activates the translocation of Cdk4-cyclin D1-p21Cip1complexes to the cell nucleus in response to a Ca2+ signal. However, this possibility remains to be demonstrated. We have shown previously that inhibition of HSP90, which is a CaM-binding protein that is associated with Cdk4, also inhibits nuclear translocation of Cdk4 and cyclin D1 (14Taules M. Rius E. Talaya D. Lopez G.A. Bachs O. Agell N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33279-33286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CaM may be essential in two steps leading to the nuclear translocation of Cdk4-cyclin D1 complexes: first, through the action of HSP90 allowing a proper Cdk4 folding (45Stepanova L. Leng X. Parker S.B. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar,46Dai K. Kobayashi R. Beach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22030-22034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and binding to cyclin D1 and p21previously, and second, binding to p21Cip1, so allowing its import to the nucleus. Alternatively, the binding of CaM to p21Cip1 may regulate another function of p21Cip1, which is not related to the nuclear import of the complexes. The fact that the CaM-binding domain of p21Cip1 is located inside the PCNA-binding domain suggests that CaM may modulate the binding of p21Cip1 to PCNA and thus its ability to inhibit DNA replication. Although further studies are necessary to elucidate the role of CaM binding to p21Cip1, the new findings presented here, showing the in vitro interaction, the coimmunoprecipitation, and the in vivo colocalization of CaM and p21Cip1, open up the possibility of the regulation of p21Cip1 functions in response to a Ca2+ signal and in a different way from p27Kip1.

https://openalex.org/W2077805620,"We have previously reported that the human somatostatin receptor type 1 (hSSTR1) stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells does not internalize but instead up-regulates at the membrane during continued agonist treatment (1 μm somatostatin (SST)-14 × 22 h). Here we have investigated the molecular basis of hSSTR1 up-regulation. hSSTR1 was up-regulated by SST in a time-, temperature-, and dose-dependent manner to saturable levels, in intact cells but not in membrane preparations. Although hSSTR1 was acutely desensitized to adenylyl cyclase coupling after 1 h SST-14 treatment, continued agonist exposure (22 h) restored functional effector coupling. Up-regulation was unaffected by cycloheximide but blocked by okadaic acid. Confocal fluorescence immunocytochemistry of intact and permeabilized cells showed progressive, time-dependent increase in surface hSSTR1 labeling, associated with depletion of intracellular SSTR1 immunofluorescent vesicles. To investigate the structural domains of hSSTR1 responsible for up-regulation, we constructed C-tail deletion (Δ) mutants and chimeric hSSTR1-hSSTR5 receptors. Human SSTR5 was chosen because it internalizes readily, displays potent C-tail internalization signals, and does not up-regulate. Like wild type hSSTR1, Δ C-tail hSSTR1 did not internalize and additionally lost the ability to up-regulate. Swapping the C-tail of hSSTR1 with that of hSSTR5 induced internalization (27%) but not up-regulation. Substitution of hSSTR5 C-tail with that of hSSTR1 converted the chimeric receptor to one resembling wild type hSSTR1 (poor internalization, 71% up-regulation). These results show that ligand-induced up-regulation of hSSTR1 occurs by a temperature-dependent active process of receptor recruitment from a pre-existing cytoplasmic pool to the plasma membrane. It does not require new protein synthesis or signal transduction, is sensitive to dephosphorylation events, and critically dependent on molecular signals in the receptor C-tail.

The cellular actions of SST include the inhibition of hormone and exocrine secretion as well as modulation of neurotransmission and cell proliferation and are mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) (2Patel Y.C.

Somatostatin receptors (SSTR) belong to the family of seven transmembrane domain proteins and comprise five distinct subtypes that are encoded by separate genes (2Patel Y.C. Srikant C.B.

In the case of the human receptors, four of the isoforms (hSSTR1–4) display weak selectivity for binding to SST-14, whereas hSSTR5 shows preference for SST-28 binding (2Patel Y.C. Srikant C.B.

The five receptors share common signaling pathways such as the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, activation of phosphotyrosine phosphatase, or modulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase through G protein-dependent mechanisms (2Patel Y.C. Srikant C.B. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 398-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 3Lamberts S.W.J. Van Der Lely A.J. de Herder W.W. N. Engl. J.

Some of the subtypes are also coupled to K+ and Ca2+ ion channels, to phospholipase C, and phospholipase A2 (2Patel Y.C. Srikant C.B. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 398-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). hSSTR1 activates a Na+/H+exchanger via a non-G protein-linked pathway (8Hou C. Gilbert R.L. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10357-10362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A common property of most GPCRs is their ability to regulate their responsiveness to continued agonist exposure (9Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Such agonist-specific regulation typically involves receptor desensitization due to uncoupling from G proteins, as well as receptor internalization and receptor degradation (9Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). The underlying molecular mechanisms have been extensively studied in the case of the β-adrenergic and several other GPCRs, and a general model has been proposed that involves phosphorylation of the C-tail and intracellular loops of the agonist-occupied receptor by a second messenger activated or G protein-coupled receptor kinase, resulting in rapid attenuation of receptor signaling. G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation promotes the binding of β-arrestin, which acts as an adapter molecule linking the receptor to clathrin-mediated endocytosis (9Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.

The endocytosed receptor is either sorted to lysosomes for degradation if agonist stimulation is prolonged or recycled back to the cell surface as a result of pH-dependent conformational change and dephosphorylation by a membrane-associated GPCR phosphatase in endosomes (9Dohlman H.G.

Since continuous exposure of receptors to agonists is unlikely to occur under normal physiological conditions, this type of response appears to be pharmacological and is observed during long term drug therapy or in disease states. Unlike receptor down-regulation, the underlying molecular mechanisms for up-regulation are poorly understood and thought to involve ligand-induced transcriptional or posttranscriptional induction of receptor synthesis and targeting to the plasma membrane (12Thomas R.F.

In the case of the SSTR family, we have previously reported that hSSTR5 stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells undergoes rapid agonist-dependent desensitization and internalization, whereas hSSTR1 under the same conditions fails to be internalized and is up-regulated at the plasma membrane following prolonged agonist exposure (23Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U. Patel Y.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4046-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U. Rocheville M. Patel Y.C. J. Biol.

To identify the underlying molecular signals, we have here created C-tail deletion mutants and hSSTR1/hSSTR5 chimeras, and we have analyzed the ability of these mutant receptors to undergo agonist-dependent internalization or up-regulation as well as G protein-linked coupling to adenylyl cyclase. We have further investigated membrane and intracellular trafficking of hSSTR1 as well as the relationship between the internalization and up-regulation pathways. We report that the up-regulated receptor is functionally coupled to G proteins and that up-regulation of hSSTR1 is an intrinsic property of the receptor that occurs in the absence of endocytosis or new protein synthesis by an active process of receptor recruitment from the cytoplasm to the cell surface. Furthermore, the receptor C-tail contains molecular signals that specify up-regulation. SST-14, SST-28, and Leu8,d-Trp22, Tyr25 SST-28 (LTT SST-28) were from Bachem (Marina Del Rey, CA). Cycloheximide, pertussis toxin, okadaic acid, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and bacitracin were from Sigma. Carrier-free Na125I was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Ham's F-12 medium, fetal bovine serum, and G418 were from Life Technologies Inc. Cyclic AMP radioimmunoassay kits were obtained from Diagnostic Products Corp. (Los Angeles, CA). All other reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from various suppliers. cDNA for wild type hSSTR5 was created as a cassette construct in PTEJ8. Wild type (wt) hSSTR1 DNA encoding the complete receptor sequence was generated by PCR amplification using human genomic DNA as template and subcloned into the pDNA3 expression vector. A series of mutant and chimeric hSSTR1/hSSTR5 receptors were created to investigate the role of the C-tail in the internalization and up-regulation properties of the receptors (Fig.1). The cytoplasmic tail (C-tail) of wt hSSTR1 contains 65 amino acid residues with 3 tyrosine residues and 11 serine or threonine residues that could serve as putative phosphorylation sites. The wt hSSTR5 C-tail contains 55 amino acid residues with 7 potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites. C-tail deletions were created at position 318 for hSSTR5 (Δ C-tail hSSTR5) and at position 331 for hSSTR1 (Δ C-tail hSSTR1). Chimeric receptors were constructed by swapping the C-tail of hSSTR5 with the C-tail of hSSTR1 and of the C-tail of hSSTR1 with the C-tail of hSSTR5. Mutations were created by the PCR overlap extension technique (25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar); for the C-tail-truncated mutants, oligonucleotide primers were used that contain an appropriately placed stop codon after position 331 (hSSTR1) and position 318 (hSSTR5). Chimeric receptors were constructed using oligonucleotide primers designed to allow separate amplification of 5′, 3′, and internal segments that were subsequently fused by PCR. All primers were designed so as to avoid any change in the reading frame as follows: primer A, 5′-GATCAAGCTTGCCGCCACCATGTTCCCCAATGGCACCGCC-3′ (R1 forward); primer B, 5′-CAGCCCGGCCGCACACACCACGGAGTAGAT-3′ (R1-R5 reverse); primer C, 5′-TGTGCGGCCGGGCTG-3′ (R1-R5 forward); primer D, 5′-GATCGAATTCTTATCAGAGCGTCGTGATCCGG-3′ (R5 reverse); primer E, 5′ GACTAAGCTTCTGCCGCCATGGAGCCCCTG -3′ (R5 forward); primer F, 5′-GCGCTTGAAGTTGTCCGAGAGGAAGC-3′ (R5-R1 reverse); primer G, 5′-CTCGGACAACTTCAAGCGCTC-3′ (R5-R1 forward); primer H, 5′-GATCGAATTCTTATCAGAGCGTCGTGATCCGG-3′ (R1 reverse). To construct the Δ C-tail hSSTR1/C-tail hSSTR5 chimera, primer pairs A and B were used to synthesize the 5′ fragment of SSTR1 using SSTR1 cDNA as template for PCR. Primer pairs C and D were used to generate the 3′ C-terminal fragment using SSTR5 cDNA as template. PCR was carried out with 50 ng of SSTR cDNA in 100 μl containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 50 mm KCl, 200 μm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 7% Me2SO, and 2.00 units of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 58 °C for 50 s, and extension at 72 °C for 75 s for 25 cycles followed by extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis; the amplified bands were electroeluted and purified. Receptor fragments A—B and C—D were then fused in a third PCR reaction to generate the full-length chimeric receptor in a ligation reaction using flanking primer pairs A and D. The Δ C-tail hSSTR5 + C-tail SSTR1 chimera was generated using primer pairs E—F and G—H to synthesize the 5′ and 3′ receptor fragments, respectively. The purified amplification products were ligated by PCR using primer pairs E and H. All 5′-flanking primers contained Hin dIII endonuclease restriction sites, Kozak consensus sequences, and initiation codons. All 3′-flanking primers comprised a stop codon followed by an Eco RI restriction site. After PCR ligation, the products were digested to completion with Hin dIII and Eco RI, and purified fragments were subcloned into the Hin dIII-Eco RI multiple cloning sites of pTEJ8. The structure of all mutant and chimeric receptor constructs was confirmed by sequence analysis (University Core DNA Service, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada). CHO-K1 cells were transfected with cDNAs for wild type or mutant and chimeric hSSTR1/hSSTR5 receptors by the Lipofectin method (Life Technology, Inc.), and stable G418-resistant nonclonally selected cells were propagated for study. wt hSSTR1 was also stably expressed in HEK-293 cells by the same method. CHO-K1 cells expressing wild type, mutant, or chimeric receptors were cultured in D75 flasks to ∼70% confluency in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 700 μg/ml G418. Cells were harvested, homogenized, and membranes prepared by centrifugation. Binding studies were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C with 20–40 μg of membrane protein and 125I-LTT SST-28 radioligand in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mmCaCl2, 5 mm McCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.02% bacitracin (binding buffer) as described previously (23Hukovic N.

Saturation binding experiments were performed with membranes using increasing concentrations of 125I-LTT SST-28 (2–2000 pm) under equilibrium binding conditions (24Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U. Rocheville M. Patel Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21416-21422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Incubations were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, rapid centrifugation, and washing. Radioactivity associated with membrane pellets was quantified in an LKB gamma counter (LKB-Wallach, Turku, Finland). Binding data were analyzed with INPLOT 4.03 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA). Receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase was tested by incubating cells for 30 min with 1 μm forskolin and 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine with or without SST (10−6 - 10−10m) at 37 °C as described previously (24Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U. Rocheville M. Patel Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21416-21422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cells were then scraped in 0.1 n HCl and assayed for cAMP by radioimmunoassay. CHO-K1 cells expressing wild type, mutant, and chimeric SSTRs were cultured in 6-well plates and studied at ∼90% confluency (1.5 × 106 cells/well). Cells were equilibrated overnight at 4 °C with 125I-LTT SST-28 with or without 100 nm SST-14 (for hSSTR1) or 100 nm SST-28 (for hSSTR5). After washing, cells were warmed to 37 °C for 15, 30, and 60 min to initiate internalization (23Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U. Patel Y.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4046-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U. Rocheville M. Patel Y.C. J. Biol.

At the end of each incubation, surface-bound radioligand was removed by treatment for 10 min at 37 °C with 1 ml of acid wash (Hanks'-buffered saline acidified to pH 5.0 with 20 mm sodium acetate). Internalized radioligand was measured as acid-resistant counts in 0.1n NaOH extracts of acid-washed cells. CHO-K1 cells expressing wild type, mutant, and chimeric receptors were cultured in 6-well plates in F-12 medium without fetal calf serum with 10−7m SST-14 or SST-28 for 4, 9, 13, 16, 19, and 22 h at 37 °C. After acid wash to remove surface-bound SST, whole cell binding assays were performed to determine total and nonspecific binding (24Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U. Rocheville M. Patel Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21416-21422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Residual surface binding was calculated as the difference between control and experimental groups. Dose dependence of up-regulation was studied by incubating cells with 10−11–10−6m SST-14 for 22 h at 37 °C. The effect of blocking protein synthesis on up-regulation of hSSTR1 was investigated by applying cycloheximide 10 μg/ml for 30 min to CHO-K1 cells expressing wt hSSTR1 as described previously (22Presky D.H. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 714-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of pertussis toxin and okadaic acid on SST-induced hSSTR1 up-regulation was determined by continuous treatment with pertussis toxin 100 ng/ml or okadaic acid 200 nmfollowed by whole cell binding analyses. To investigate the fate of the up-regulated membrane receptor, cells were cultured for 22 h with 10−7m SST-14 to induce up-regulation. Cells were then washed gently with 1 ml of 20 mm sodium acetate pH 5.0 for 2 min to remove surface-bound SST-14 and reincubated in culture medium without ligand. Residual surface receptors were analyzed at 12 and 22 h by whole cell binding. To analyze surface and cytoplasmic pools of receptors, intact or 0.2% Triton X-100-permeabilized CHO-K1 cells expressing wt hSSTR1 or wt hSSTR5 were processed for confocal fluorescence immunocytochemistry using rabbit polyclonal antipeptide receptor antibodies (4Kumar U.

CHO-K1 cells expressing SSTRs were cultured to ∼70% confluency and treated with SST for different times. To analyze surface expression of receptors, cells were incubated in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin in the presence of SSTR primary antibodies for 8–12 h at 4 °C. After washing in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl (TBS), pH 7.4, cells were fixed for 30 min at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde. To label the cytoplasmic pool of receptors, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in TBS for 5 min at room temperature, washed three times in TBS, and incubated with SSTR primary antibodies for 8–12 h at 4 °C. Antipeptide antibodies directed against the N-terminal segment of hSSTR1 (49GTLSEGQGS57) and hSSTR5 (4LF(P/S)(A/L)STPS11) were produced as described previously and used at a dilution of 1:500 (4Kumar U. Laird D. Srikant C.B. Escher E. Patel Y.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4473-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Preimmune serum and antigen-absorbed antibody were used as controls. Cells were then rinsed three times in TBS and incubated for 1 h with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:100) at room temperature. After three additional washes, cells were mounted with immunofluor and viewed under a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope. Images were obtained as single optical sections taken through the middle of cells and averaged over 32 scans/frame. They were archived on an Iomega Jaz Disc and printed on a Kodak XLS 8300 high resolution (300 dpi) printer. The C-tail deletion and chimeric receptors were correctly targeted to the plasma membrane as determined by binding analysis (Table I). Saturation binding analysis of CHO-K1 cell membranes revealed a comparable level of expression of wt hSSTR1 and wt hSSTR5 (229 ± 10 and 180 ± 28 fmol/mg protein, respectively). The Δ C-tail hSSTR1 mutant displayed a small reduction in Bmax (113 ± 14 fmol/mg) and binding affinity (Kd 2.3 nm compared with Kd 0.62 nmfor wt hSSTR1). As previously reported, the Δ C-tail hSSTR5 mutant displayed high affinity ligand binding (Kd 0.89 nm) which, however, was 3-fold lower than that of the wild type receptor (21Ng G.Y.K. Varghese G. Chung H.T. Trogadis J. Seeman P. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4199-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, the binding parameters of the Δ C-tail hSSTR5 mutant were comparable to those of the wild type receptor. Likewise, the Kd and Bmax of the two chimeric receptors were comparable to that of wt hSSTR1 and wt hSSTR5.Table IComparison of binding, internalization, up-regulation, and adenylyl cyclase coupling of wild type, mutant, and chimeric receptorsReceptorKdBmaxInternalizationUp-regulationAdenylyl cyclase couplingnmfmol/mg protein% 60 min% 22 h% inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMPwt hSSTR10.62 ± 0.13229 ± 100110 ± 1768 ± 4wt hSSTR50.31 ± 0.03180 ± 2866 ± 7070 ± 6Δ C tail hSSTR12.3 ± 0.75113 ± 140046 ± 3Δ C tail hSSTR50.89 ± 0.07262 ± 3244 ± 500Δ C tail hSSTR1 + C tail hSSTR50.64 ± 0.11384 ± 3927 ± 9030 ± 3Δ C tail hSSTR5 + C tail hSSTR10.34 ± 0.07220 ± 23071 ± 1838 ± 4Data shown are the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments.

As reported previously, 125I-LTT SST-28 when bound to hSSTR5 was rapidly internalized in a time- and temperature-dependent manner with 66 ± 7% internalization after 60 min at 37 °C, whereas hSSTR1 under comparable incubation conditions showed no internalization (21Ng G.Y.K.

Chem. 1988; 263: 714-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, long term exposure to SST-14 or SST-28 (10−7m) induced time-dependent up-regulation of hSSTR1 (110 ± 17% increase in surface binding after 22 h at 37 °C) with no effect on hSSTR5 (Fig.2 A). Up-regulation of hSSTR1 was temperature-dependent and was reduced to 44 ± 16% at 20 °C and virtually abolished at 4 °C (Fig.2 A). Up-regulation was also dose-dependent over the concentration range 10−11–10−6m SST-14 (Fig. 2 C). When cells expressing hSSTR1 were first treated with SST-14 (10−7m) for 22 h to up-regulate the receptors, and the SST was then removed, there was a slow loss of surface hSSTR1 expression from 110% at time 0 to 48 ± 9% at 12 h and 8 ± 3% at 22 h (Fig.2 B).

Using a multitude of spectroscopic techniques, we have determined the axial ligand coordination of the heme-Hmu O complex. The ferric complex shows a pH-dependent reversible transition between a water-bound hexacoordinate high spin neutral pH form and an alkaline form, having high spin and low spin states, with a p Ka of 9. 1H NMR, EPR, and resonance Raman of the heme-Hmu O complex establish that a neutral imidazole of a histidine residue is the proximal ligand of the complex, similar to mammalian heme oxygenase. EPR of the deoxy cobalt porphyrin IX-Hmu O complex confirms this proximal histidine coordination. Oxy cobalt-Hmu O EPR reveals a hydrogen-bonding interaction between the O2and an exchangeable proton in the Hmu O distal pocket and two distinct orientations for the bound O2. Mammalian heme oxygenase has only one O2 orientation. This difference and the mixed spin states at alkaline pH indicate structural differences in the distal environment between Hmu O and its mammalian counterpart.

Mammalian amphipathic microsomal heme oxygenase isoforms, HO-1 and HO-2, catalyze the regiospecific oxidative degradation of iron protoporphyrin IX (heme hereafter) to biliverdin IXα, iron, and CO in the presence of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, which serves as an electron donor (1Tenhunen R.

HO is not a hemeprotein by itself but utilizes heme as both a prosthetic group and a substrate, a property unique to this enzyme. In the HO catalytic cycle, HO first binds 1 equivalent of hemin to form a hemin-HO complex. The first electron donated from the reductase reduces the hemin iron to the ferrous state. Then O2 binds to form a metastable oxy complex. Further electron donation to the oxy complex initiates the three-step conversion of oxyheme to the ferric iron-biliverdin complex through the intermediates α-hydroxyheme and verdoheme (2Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar, 3Yoshida T.

In the pathogen Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causative agent of diphtheria, a gene, hmu O, which encodes a 24-kDa protein responsible for heme utilization, has been discovered (12Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 838-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hmu O, the hmu O-coded protein, is the first bacterial heme degradation enzyme isolated to date. Wilks and Schmitt (13Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) have constructed an Escherichia coli expression system of Hmu O and purified a 24-kDa protein that stoichiometrically binds hemin and converts it to biliverdin IXα and CO upon the addition of electron donors. Recently, we have demonstrated that α-meso-hydroxyheme and verdoheme are intermediates of Hmu O catalysis (14Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21319-21325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction analysis of the heme-Hmu O complex have been done to date (15Chu G.C. Park S.-Y. Shiro Y. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), little is known about the Hmu O active-site structure. The electronic state and the coordination structure of the heme group of the complex have not been established. Elucidation of this is essential to understanding Hmu O catalytic mechanisms. This paper reports the first axial coordination structure of the heme-Hmu O complex. By optical absorption, resonance Raman, EPR and NMR spectroscopy, we have examined the heme and cobalt porphyrin complexes of a purified, recombinant Hmu O expressed from a synthetic gene in E. coli (14Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21319-21325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have established that the proximal ligand of the heme-Hmu O complex is a neutral imidazole group of a histidine residue. EPR studies of the cobalt porphyrin complex show a hydrogen-bond formation between the bound O2 and an exchangeable proton in the distal pocket of Hmu O. Although there exist some similarities between Hmu O and mammalian HO, we have found that the structure of the Hmu O distal pocket is different from that of mammalian HO. Expression and purification of the recombinant Hmu O and its reconstitution with hemin are described elsewhere (14Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol.

The cobalt porphyrin-Hmu O (cobalt-Hmu O) complex was prepared as described previously (17Ikeda-Saito M. Lutz R.S. Shelley D.A. McKelvey E.J. Mattera R. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23641-23647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless specified, experiments were conducted in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7. Optical absorption spectra were recorded on Hewlett Packard 8453 and Hitachi U-3210 spectrophotometers at 20 °C. Resonance Raman spectra were obtained using the following laser excitations: 413.2 nm line of a Kr+ laser (Spectra Physics 2016) for the ferric Hmu O derivatives; 442.8 nm line of a He-Cd laser (Kinmon Electronics, CD4805R) for the ligand-free ferrous derivative; and 422.6 nm line of a diode laser pumped by an intracavity frequency-doubled CrLiSrAlF6 laser (Hitachi Metals, ICD-430) for the ferrous CO complex. The scattered light at 90° was dispersed with a single polychrometer (Ritsu Oyokogaku, DG-1000) and detected by a cooled CCD detector (Amstromed, CCD3200). The laser power on the sample was approximately 10 mW, and the accumulation time was 5 min. For all measurements, the sample temperature was kept at 20 °C. The Raman shifts were calibrated with toluene and carbon tetrachloride. EPR spectra were obtained by a Bruker ESP-300 spectrometer operating at 9.45 GHz. An Oxford liquid helium flow cryostat was used for cryogenic measurements. The microwave frequency was monitored by a frequency counter (HP-5350), and the magnetic flux density was determined by an NMR gaussmeter (Bruker ER-035 m). Proton NMR (1H NMR) spectra were recorded by a Varian Inova 600 MHz instrument at 25 °C. Parameters included 90° pulse-widths of 6 μs, spectral widths of 100–140 kHz with the carrier frequency adjusted to the water frequency, and 512 to 1024 accumulated transients. The spectra were referenced to external 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid. Fig.1 shows the pH-dependent changes in the optical absorption spectrum of the hemin-Hmu O complex between pH 6 and 10. At pH 6 (spectrum A, Fig. 1), the complex has a Soret peak at 404 nm and bands at 500 and 630 nm. The spectrum is similar to that of the hemin complex of mammalian HO (16Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Host J.R. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1010-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the position (404 nm) and the extinction coefficient (150 mm−1·cm−1) of the Soret peak (14Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21319-21325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the ferric iron of the hemin-Hmu O complex has been postulated to be hexacoordinate high spin. At alkaline pH (spectrum B, Fig. 1), the intensity of the Soret and visible peaks decrease, and new peaks at 540 and 575 nm emerge. The latter peaks are similar to those of the low spin hydroxide form of the mammalian HO-hemin complex (16Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Host J.R. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1010-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pH-dependent spectral change observed is reversible between pH 6 and 10 and characterized by a p Ka of 9.0, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. In contrast to mammalian HO, which is predominantly in the hydroxide-bound (OH-bound) low spin form at alkaline pH, the hemin-Hmu O complex still retains a partially high spin form. Resonance Raman spectra of the hemin-Hmu O complex have confirmed the pH-dependent spin state changes deduced from the aforementioned optical absorption measurements. In the region of the Raman spectrum containing the porphyrin skeletal modes are lines whose frequencies characterize the spin and coordination states of the hemin iron (18Spiro T.G. Stong J.D. Stein P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 2648-2655Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Specifically, the lines assigned as ν2 and ν3 are located in the regions of 1580–1590 and 1500–1510 cm−1 for hexacoordinate low spin iron, 1560–1565 and 1475–1485 cm−1 for hexacoordinate high spin iron, and 1570–1575 and 1490–1500 cm−1 for pentacoordinate high spin iron. As shown in spectrum A of Fig. 2, at pH 7, the ν2 and ν3 for hemin-Hmu O are 1563 and 1483 cm−1, respectively, indicating a hexacoordinate high spin iron. At pH 9 (spectrum B, Fig. 2), these high spin Raman lines become weaker as the lines characteristic of a hexacoordinate low spin iron become apparent, as indicated by the ν2 and ν3 lines at 1579 and 1504 cm−1, respectively. The presence of both high spin and low spin Raman lines in the pH 9 spectrum is consistent with the results of the optical absorption spectra described above. EPR spectra of the ferric heme-Hmu O complex are shown in Fig.3. The complex at pH 7 (spectrum A) exhibits an EPR spectrum of an axial symmetry typical of ferric high spin hemeproteins (g = 6 and 2). The g = 2 region spectrum recorded in buffered H217O (43% enrichment) is compared with that in H216O in the inset of Fig. 3. Substitution of H216O with the partially enriched H217O induces a broadening of the g = 2 signal. This broadening is due to the hyperfine interaction caused by the nuclear spin 5/2 of the iron-bound 17O. A similar phenomenon has been observed in metmyoglobin (metMb), in which H2O is coordinated to the hemin iron as the sixth ligand (19Vuk-Pavlovic S. Siderer Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 79: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, such a broadening has not been observed in pentacoordinate horseradish peroxidase because of the absence of a coordinated H2O (19Vuk-Pavlovic S. Siderer Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 79: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Gupta R.K. Mildvan A.S. Schonbaum G.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 89: 1334-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, our EPR results show that the sixth ligand of the hemin-Hmu O complex is H2O. The EPR spectrum of hemin-Hmu O at pH 9 (spectrum B, Fig. 3) demonstrates both high spin and low spin species. Consistent with the aforementioned optical absorption and resonance Raman results, the high spin species is the same as that at pH 7. However, two types of low spin forms are detected. The major form is characterized by g values of 2.67, 2.21, and 1.80, whereas the minor form has g values of 2.72, 2.16, and 1.76. The former set of g values is close to that of the OH-bound low spin species reported for the HO-1 complex (g = 2.67, 2.21, and 1.79) (16Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Host J.R. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1010-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we designate the major form as the OH-bound low spin species of the Hmu O complex. The nature of the minor low spin form is ambiguous at this time. At pH 10, the signal amplitude of the high spin species is reduced, whereas that of the hydroxide low spin species is increased (data not shown). In Fig. 4, the resolved portion of the1H NMR spectrum of the hemin-Hmu O complex in 90% H2O and 10% D2O is compared with that of metMb. The NMR spectrum of the Hmu O complex has resolved signals at 75, 74, 67, and 62 ppm with areas of three protons. These are manifestations of the heme methyl groups. The chemical shift pattern of these methyl peaks is different from that of metMb, which exhibits heme methyl resonances from 52 to 90 ppm (89.8, 83.3, 72.0, and 52.4 ppm). Different from Hmu O, the rat HO-1 hemin complex reported by La Mar and co-workers (21Hernandez G. Wilks A. Paolesse R. Smith K.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. La Mar G.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) has a complicated hyperfine-shift pattern in the 60–90-ppm region because of the hemin-orientational disorder about the α, γ-meso axis. For metMb, the single exchangeable proton resonance at 102 ppm is assigned to a proximal histidine (His) imidazole N1H (22La Mar G.N. de Ropp J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 90: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the hemin-Hum O spectrum, a broad single proton resonance is discerned at 99 ppm. This signal is absent when the measurement is conducted in buffered D2O (data not shown). The appearance of the single proton peak in H2O but not in D2O solution attests that it is an exchangeable proton strongly coupled to the ferric iron but not associated with the porphyrin itself. Because the chemical shift is similar to that for the axial His imidazole of metMb, this resonance at 99 ppm for the hemin-Hmu O complex is deduced to be from the proximal imidazole N1H proton. The implication of this deduction is that the proximal ligand of the heme iron in Hmu O is an imidazole of a His residue. EPR spectra of the nitric oxide (14NO and 15NO)-bound ferrous heme-Hmu O complexes are shown in spectra A and B of Fig. 5, respectively, along with the spectrum of the 15NO-bound rat HO-1 complex (spectrum C, Fig. 5). The Hmu O complexes have spectra typical of NO hemeproteins with rhombic symmetry (g1 = 2.082, g2 = 2.004, and g3 = 1.966). A comparison of the 14NO and 15NO spectra demonstrates that the doublet splitting associated with a coupling constant of 3.0 mT shown in the 15NO spectrum is due to the nuclear spin 1/2 of the15N of the bound 15NO. Thus, the triplet hyperfine splitting (A = 0.68 mT) associated with the g = 2.004 component arises from the nuclear spin 1 of the14N of the axial ligand trans to the bound NO (23Yonetani T. Yamamoto H. Erman J. Leigh Jr., J.S. Reed G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2447-2455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This firmly establishes that the proximal ligand of the heme-Hmu O complex is a nitrogenous base, most likely an imidazole group of His. Further support of this is given by the resonance Raman spectrum of the ligand-free ferrous heme-Hmu O (Fig. 6), which shows a line at 221 cm−1, the characteristic frequency of an iron-histidine stretching mode in pentacoordinate ferrous hemeproteins (24Kitagawa T. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 97-131Google Scholar). For the rat HO-1 complex, the iron-histidine stretching mode is observed at 218 cm−1 (25Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Takeuchi N. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5531-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These results on the ferrous forms of the enzyme are consistent with the imidazole ligation deduced from NMR of the ferric form described above.Figure 6Low frequency region of the resonance Raman spectrum of the ligand-free ferrous heme-Hmu O complex in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The CO-bound form of the ferrous heme-Hmu O complex exhibits a resonance Raman spectrum (Fig. 7) with ν2 and ν3 lines at 1583 and 1498 cm−1, respectively, indicating a CO-bound low spin heme. Three carbon isotope-sensitive bands are found for the CO-bound Hmu O complex when the 12CO and 13CO (spectra A and B, Fig. 7, respectively) derivatives are compared. Following the previous mode assignment done on the CO-bound rat HO-1 complex (25Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Takeuchi N. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5531-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the line at 508 cm−1 can be assigned to the Fe-CO stretching mode, 572 cm−1 to the Fe-C-O bending mode, and 1962 cm−1 to the C-O stretching mode (spectrum C, Fig. 7). EPR of the deoxy form of the cobalt porphyrin-Hmu O complex (cobalt-Hmu O) displays a spectrum of axial symmetry typical of a pentacoordinate cobalt(II) complex with a nitrogenous base axial ligand (spectrum not shown). The g//signal of deoxy- cobalt-Hmu O has an octaplet hyperfine structure due to the hyperfine interaction with the 59Co nucleus. Each of the hyperfine lines is split further into a triplet because of the hyperfine interaction with a nitrogen atom in the proximal axial ligand. The g values and hyperfine coupling constants are estimated as g⊥ = 2.33, g// = 2.03, A//(59Co) = 7.8 mT, and a//(14N) = 1.8 mT. As shown in spectrum C of Fig.8, the EPR spectrum of oxy cobalt-Hmu O, recorded at 25 K, exhibits free radical-type absorption around g = 2, similar to other oxygenated forms of cobalt (II) complexes including cobalt-Mb and cobalt-HO (spectra A and B, Fig. 8, respectively) (17Ikeda-Saito M.

Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8251-8252Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Consistent with the oxy forms of cobalt-Mb and cobalt-HO, cobalt-Hmu O dissolved in buffered D2O (spectrum D, Fig. 8) exhibits a narrower hyperfine structure than in buffered H2O (spectrum C, Fig. 8). In comparison to HO, the spacing and the amplitude of the hyperfine structure associated with the g// signal (g ∼ 2.1) are irregular in the cobalt-Hmu O spectrum. Based on EPR analyses of oxy cobalt-Mb, which show two paramagnetic species because of the different orientations of the bound O2 (27Hori H. Ikeda-Saito M. Yonetani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3636-3642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we attribute the oxy cobalt-Hmu O spectral irregularity to the two distinct bound O2 orientations present in oxy cobalt-Hmu O. This is different from oxy cobalt-HO, which has only one bound O2orientation (26Fujii H. Dou Y. Zhou H. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8251-8252Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Assuming two paramagnetic species for oxy cobalt-Hmu O, the following EPR parameters have been calculated by spectral simulation. For species I, g1 = 2.100, g2 = 2.008, and g3 = 1.991, A1 = 1.72 mT, A2 = 0.92 mT, and A3 = 0.85 mT. For species II, g1 = 2.108, g2 = 2.008, and g3 = 1.991, A1 = 1.72 mT, A2 = 0.92 mT, and A3 = 0.85 mT. Giving equal contribution to each of the paramagnetic species, our simulated EPR spectrum (spectrum E, Fig. 8) matches the experimental spectrum (spectrum C, Fig. 8). The two different orientations of the bound O2 are almost equally populated. EPR spectra of the ferrous NO complex of heme-Hmu O (Fig. 5) and deoxy cobalt-Hmu O (Fig.8) demonstrate a nitrogenous base as the proximal ligand of Hmu O. Moreover, the single exchangeable 1H NMR signal at 99 ppm in the hemin-Hum O complex (Fig. 4) is attributable to the proximal His imidazole N1H and provides evidence of an imidazole coordination. Resonance Raman scattering of the ligand-free ferrous heme-Hmu O yields a band at 221 cm−1 (Fig. 6), a frequency unique to the iron-histidine stretching mode of pentacoordinate ferrous hemeproteins. The observations from these three different techniques conclusively establish that the proximal axial ligand of the heme-Hmu O complex is an imidazole of a His residue. The amino acid sequence of Hmu O contains eight histidines (12Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 838-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), one of which is within an 18-residue stretch that is highly similar to the region between Leu-129 and Val-146 of eukaryotic HO-1 when His-128 of Hmu O is aligned to His-132 of HO-1 (12Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 838-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since His-132 of HO-1 has been determined not to be the axial ligand of the heme iron (28Mansfield Matera K. Zhou H. Migita C.T. Hobert S.E. Ishikawa K. Katakura K. Maeshima H. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4909-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that His-128 of Hmu O is the proximal axial ligand either. Of the remaining 7 histidines in Hmu O, His-20 is potentially the proximal ligand because of its aligned position to His-25 of HO-1, which is the proximal axial ligand of mammalian HO-1 (29Sun J. Loehr T.M. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13734-13740Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 30Ito-Maki M. Ishikawa K. Mansfield Matera K. Sato M. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As described above, an imidazole group of a His is coordinated to the iron of the heme-Hmu O complex. Whether it is a neutral imidazole or an imidazolate anion can be assessed by the resonance Raman measurements of the ligand-free and the CO-bound ferrous heme-Hmu O complexes. For ligand-free ferrous hemeproteins, the imidazolate-iron stretching mode is in the 240 cm−1 region, whereas the neutral imidazole-iron stretching mode is in the 200–220 cm−1region (24Kitagawa T. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 97-131Google Scholar). Ligand-free ferrous heme-Hmu O has a Raman band at 221 cm−1, thus validating the presence of a neutral imidazole. Similarly, the Fe-CO and C-O stretching frequencies of the CO-bound heme-Hmu O observed are representative of a neutral imidazole coordination and are close to those of rat HO-1 (25Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Takeuchi N. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5531-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Additional support of this coordination is provided by the frequency of the Fe-C-O bending mode, which is sensitive to a specific axial ligand and varies little within a given type of ligand (25Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Takeuchi N. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5531-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 31Argade P.V. Ching Y.C. Rousseau D.L.

Chem. 1987; 262: 4549-4556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the neutral imidazole-CO complex, the Fe-C-O bending modes are found in the 576–579 cm−1 region, whereas those for the imidazolate heme-CO complex are in the 582–590 cm−1 region. Our value of 572 cm−1 for the CO-bound heme-Hmu O (Fig. 7) further substantiates a neutral imidazole, not an imidazolate, as the proximal ligand in the heme-Hmu O complex. From the isotopic H2O substitution EPR measurements, the identity of the sixth ligand of the hemin-Hmu O at neutral pH is determined to be a H2O molecule. H2O coordination is further corroborated by the optical absorption and resonance Raman spectra described earlier, spectra that resemble those of other H2O-bound hexacoordinate high spin hemeproteins. Based on the similarities of the low spin components distinguished in the optical absorption, resonance Raman, and EPR spectra of the hemin-Hmu O complex (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, respectively) to those of rat HO-1 at alkaline pH, we infer that hydroxide is the axial ligand of the low spin Hmu O species at alkaline pH. Acid-base transitions observed in ferric hemeproteins with a H2O ligand are generally correlated to a change in the protonation status of an amino acid residue in the distal heme pocket. The distal pocket residue forms a hydrogen bond with the bound-H2O ligand, and deprotonation of the distal residue, such as His in globins, causes ionization of the iron-bound H2O. Consequently, this results in the hydroxide form (34Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971: 10-11Google Scholar). In mammalian HO-1, the group responsible for the ionization is not directly linked to the bound H2O (25Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Takeuchi N. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5531-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 35Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) but is proposed to be by a long range hydrogen bond network via H2O molecules. Our results on hemin-Hmu O show the presence of an ionizable group that is responsible for the acid-base transition. Because the observed p Ka of 9.0 for the hemin-Hmu O complex is higher than the p Ka values of 7.6 and 8.5 for mammalian HO-1 and HO-2, respectively (16Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K.

https://openalex.org/W1998354003,"Abstract Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a major acute-phase protein synthesized and secreted mainly by the liver. In response to acute inflammation, its expression may be induced up to 1000-fold, primarily as a result of a 200-fold increase in the rate ofSAA gene transcription. We showed previously that cytokine-induced transcription of the SAA3 gene promoter requires a transcriptional enhancer that contains three functional elements: two CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-binding sites and a third site that interacts with a constitutively expressed transcription factor, SAA3 enhancer factor (SEF). Each of these binding sites as well as cooperation among their binding factors is necessary for maximum transcription activation by inflammatory cytokines. Deletion or site-specific mutations in the SEF-binding site drastically reduced SAA3 promoter activity, strongly suggesting that SEF is important in SAA3 promoter function. To further elucidate its role in the regulation of the SAA3 gene, we purified SEF from HeLa nuclear extracts to near homogeneity by using conventional liquid chromatography and DNA affinity chromatography. Ultraviolet cross-linking and Southwestern experiments indicated that SEF consisted of a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa. Protein sequencing and antibody supershift experiments identified SEF as transcription factor LBP-1c/CP2/LSF. Cotransfection of SEF expression vector with SAA3-luciferase reporter resulted in approximately a 5-fold increase in luciferase activity. Interestingly, interleukin-1 treatment of SEF-transfected cells caused dramatic synergistic activation (31-fold) of the SAA3 promoter. In addition to its role in regulating SAA3 gene expression, we provide evidence that SEF could also bind in a sequence-specific manner to the promoters of the α2-macroglobulin and Aα-fibrinogen genes and to an intronic enhancer of the human Wilm’s tumor 1 gene, suggesting a functional role in the regulation of these genes."

Two novel alternative pathways have recently been postulated to exist in mammals, and these additionally depend on Δ3,5-Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase (di-isomerase-dependent) or on Δ3,5-Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase and 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (reductase-dependent). We report the identification of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae oleic acid-inducible DCI1 (YOR180c) gene encoding peroxisomal di-isomerase. Enzyme assays conducted on soluble extracts derived from yeast cells overproducing Dci1p using 3,5,8,11,14-eicosapentenoyl-CoA as substrate demonstrated a specific di-isomerase activity of 6 nmol × min−1 per mg of protein.

Amplification of this intrinsic activity replaced Eci1p since it restored growth of the eci1Δ strain on petroselinic acid for which di-isomerase is not required whereas Eci1p is. Heterologous expression in yeast of rat di-isomerase resulted in a peroxisomal protein that was enzymatically active but did not re-establish growth of the eci1Δ mutant on oleic acid. A strain devoid of Dci1p grew on oleic acid to wild-type levels, whereas one lacking both Eci1p and Dci1p grew as poorly as the eci1Δ mutant. Hence, we reasoned that yeast di-isomerase does not additionally represent a physiological 3,2-isomerase and that Dci1p and the postulated alternative pathways in which it is entrained are dispensable for degrading oleic acid.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6892-6899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) operates in the absence of 2,4-reductase (bent arrow; Fig.1 C). Di-isomerase activity that transfers double bonds from the Δ3-Δ5 to the Δ2-Δ4 positions has hitherto not been identified in yeast, and it was not known whether fungi possess di-isomerase- or reductase-dependent pathways. Although the cDNA of the rat ECH1 gene encoding both peroxisomal and mitochondrial di-isomerase has previously been cloned and characterized (14Filppula S.A. Yagi A.I. Kilpeläinen S.H. Novikov D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 349-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a knockout mouse model devoid of this enzyme activity is not yet available. Therefore, the in vivo requirement in eukaryotes for di-isomerase during the breakdown of fatty acids with double bonds at odd-numbered positions remains unknown. This study is concerned with whether yeast cells possess all of the enzymes entrained in the alternative pathways for degrading oleic acid postulated to exist in mammals and whether these alternatives are physiologically significant. We report on the oleic acid-inducible DCI1 gene encoding yeast peroxisomal di-isomerase. Identification of DCI1 had meant that S. cerevisiae could serve as a model system for studying the requirement of alternative routes for growth on fatty acids with double bonds at odd-numbered positions. We provide growth data on mutants devoid of the three auxiliary enzymes Dci1p, Sps19p, and Eci1p, and we discuss the in vivo significance of the alternative pathways. Escherichia coli strain DH10B was used for all plasmid amplifications and isolations. The S. cerevisiae strains constructed here were derived from BJ1991 (15Jones E.W. Genetics. 1977; 85: 23-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are listed in Table I. Construction of strains BJ1991 pex6Δ and BJ1991 pox1Δ has been described elsewhere (16Gurvitz A. Rottensteiner H.

In non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus insulin responses to GIP are blunted, possibly due to altered signal transduction or reduced receptor number. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct truncated GIP receptors to study the importance of the carboxyl-terminal tail (CT) in binding, signaling, and receptor internalization. Receptors truncated at amino acids 425, 418, and 405, expressed in COS-7 or CHO-K1 cells, exhibited similar binding to wild type receptors. GIP-dependent cAMP production with the 405 mutant was decreased in COS-7 cells. Maximal cAMP production in CHO-K1 cells was reduced with all truncated forms. Binding was undetectable with a receptor truncated at amino acid 400; increasing tail length by adding 5 alanines restored binding and signaling. Mutants produced by alanine scanning of residues 394–401, adjacent to transmembrane domain 7, were all functional. CT truncation by 30 or more amino acids, mutation of serines 426/427, singly or combined, or complete CT serine knockout all reduced receptor internalization rate. The majority of the GIP receptor CT is therefore not required for signaling, a minimum chain length of ∼405 amino acids is needed for receptor expression, and serines 426 and 427 are important for regulating rate of receptor internalization.

Possible explanations for a decreased responsiveness to GIP include a defective signal-transduction system and a reduction in the number of functional pancreatic islet receptors due to altered expression, mutation, or degree of desensitization and/or internalization. To elucidate which of these could be involved in reduced responsiveness, it is necessary to develop a greater understanding of the functional roles played by the different structural components of the GIP receptor.

However little is known regarding the specific components of the GIP receptor, which are important for G-protein coupling or regulation of desensitization and internalization. Extensive mutagenesis and chimeric receptor studies on the β-adrenergic and cholinergic receptors have indicated that all of the intracellular loops of the seven transmembrane class of receptors can play a role in G-protein binding, although the NH2 and COOH termini of the third intracellular loop are considered to be of primary importance for both G-protein binding and conferring specificity of action (17O'Dowd B.F.

In recent studies on the GLP-1 receptor, which is very closely related to that for GIP, sequences in the proximal and distal portions of third intracellular loop were shown to be required for coupling to Gs and adenylyl cyclase (21Takhar S.

In contrast to the extensive studies on the role of the intracellular loops in G-protein-coupled receptor function, fewer functional studies on the role of the COOH-terminal tail (CT) have been performed.

Additionally, the CT has been suggested to play a role in routing transport of receptors to the plasma membrane (27Parker E. Ross E. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) receptors has been shown to be required for both receptor desensitization and sequestration and, in the case of the GLP-1 receptor, a series of three serine doublets exerts a dose-dependent influence on both events (32Widmann C. Dolci W. Thorens B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The current studies were directed at defining the functional importance of the CT of the rat GIP receptor. Carboxyl-terminally truncated mutants of the receptor, produced by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in COS-7 and CHO-K1 cells, were studied with a view to determining the effect of such mutations on ligand binding, stimulation of G-protein-coupling to adenylyl cyclase, and ligand-induced internalization. In addition, studies were made on the effects of partially replacing the CT of the shortest, inactive, mutant form with a poly-alanine tail, and of mutating individual amino acids within the proximal CT and all serines throughout the CT. It is concluded that the majority of the GIP receptor CT is not required for signaling, a minimum length of the tail, rather than the specific constituent amino acids, is important for transport and insertion of the receptor into the plasma membrane, and that Ser-426 and Ser-427 are involved in receptor internalization. A polymerase chain reaction strategy was used to generate truncation mutants, utilizing the rat receptor cDNA (5Wheeler M.B. Gelling R.W. McIntosh C.H.S. Georgiou J. Brown J.C. Pederson R.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4629-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the vector pcDNA 3 (Invitrogen Co., San Diego, CA) as template. The 5′-sense oligonucleotide primer corresponded to coding nucleotides −3 to +19 (5′-AGGATGCCCCTGCGGCTGTTGC-3′). Five 3′-antisense oligonucleotide primers were designed such that a stop codon (underlined) was introduced at desired positions to generate the mutants GIP-R-425, GIP-R-418, GIP-R-405 and GIP-R-400. Additionally, to examine the effect of nonspecific sequence extension of the COOH-terminal tail, primers were designed to extend residues 400 and 396 with poly-alanine tails of 5 and 9 residues. These are designated GIP-R-405A5 and GIP-R-396A9. The respective primers corresponded to coding nucleotide bases: 1255–1276, 5′-CTACAAAGGCACCGCCCGGGGGGC-3′ (GIP-R-425); 1255–1236, 5′-CTACTGCCCCAGGTGCGGACGTG-3′ (GIP-R-418); 1216–1196, 5′-CTAGAGACGCAGACGGCGGATCTC-3′ (GIP-R-405); 1198–1175, 5′-CTAGATCTCCGACTGTACCTCTTTGTTGAT-3′ (GIP-R-400); 5′-CTATGCTGCTGCTGCTGCGATCTCCGACTGTACCTCTTTGTT3′ (GIP-R-400A5); and, 5′-CTATGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTACCTCTTTGTTGATGAAGCA-3′ (GIP-R-396A9). To examine more exactly the contribution of the most proximal residues in the CT for receptor expression and G-protein coupling to adenylyl cyclase, a double-stranded site mutagenesis strategy (Chameleon, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to substitute individually the 8 residues (394–401) extending from the predicted seventh transmembrane domain, with alanine residues. The resulting constructs were designated GIP-R-K394A, GIP-R-E395A, GIP-R-V396A, GIP-R-Q397A, GIP-R-S398A, GIP-R-E399A, GIP-R-I400A, and GIP-R-R401A. A deletion mutant lacking residues 397–400 (GIP-R-ΔQSEI), a mutant with cysteine 411 changed to alanine (GIP-R-C411A), and a series of alanine substitution mutations with CT serine residues mutated either individually (S398A, S406A, S426A, S427A, S440A, S453A), in multiples (S426A/S427A) or completely (S398A-S453A), were generated using the same methodology. The identities of all mutants were confirmed by sequence analysis (T7-Sequencing, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For transient expression studies, COS-7 cells (3 × 106) were seeded in 10-cm dishes (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cansera, Roxdale, Ontario). Cells were transfected the following day with 5 μg (for cAMP assays) or 10 μg (for binding assays) of either the wild type receptor (GIP-R-455) cDNA or the appropriate mutant constructs by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (5Wheeler M.B. Gelling R.W. McIntosh C.H.S. Georgiou J. Brown J.C. Pederson R.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4629-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All plasmid DNAs were prepared and purified using identical protocols, and the integrity of the DNA was checked before transfection. To minimize variability in day-to-day transfection efficiency, the various constructs for each set of experiments were generally all transfected at the same time using the same mixture. In all cases, the wild type receptor construct was transfected as a control to allow correction for any small day-to-day variations in transfection efficiency. 15 h after transfection, the cells were passaged into either 6-well plates for cAMP studies, or 10-cm dishes for binding studies, and cultured for an additional 48 h. For production of permanent CHO-K1 cell lines expressing the mutant GIP receptor cDNAs, cells were grown in DMEM/F12 media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Cansera) on 10-cm dishes until ∼80% confluent. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of the appropriate cDNA using the CaPO4co-precipitation method (5Wheeler M.B. Gelling R.W. McIntosh C.H.S. Georgiou J. Brown J.C. Pederson R.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4629-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As we have previously demonstrated that cloned CHO-K1 cell lines obtained by pooling of clones, and maintained under high stringency selection, express receptors at levels similar to high level expressing clones (33Gelling R.W.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2640-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), pooled CHO-K1 cell lines expressing receptor constructs were isolated under high G418 (800 μg/ml) selection. The wild type GIP-R-455 cDNA and stable line have been described previously (5Wheeler M.B. Gelling R.W. McIntosh C.H.S. Georgiou J. Brown J.C. Pederson R.A.

Synthetic porcine GIP (5 μg) was iodinated by the chloramine-T method, and the125I-GIP further purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography to a specific activity of 250–350 μCi/μg, as described previously (5Wheeler M.B. Gelling R.W. McIntosh C.H.S. Georgiou J. Brown J.C. Pederson R.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4629-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of tracer were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until use. Binding analyses were performed as described previously (5Wheeler M.B. Gelling R.W. McIntosh C.H.S. Georgiou J. Brown J.C. Pederson R.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4629-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, COS-7 cells were washed twice in binding buffer (BB; DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Cells (5 × 105/tube) were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 125I-GIP (50,000 cpm), in the presence or absence of unlabeled synthetic human GIP (Hukabel, Montreal, Canada or Bachem, Torrance, CA) in a final volume of 200 μl. (It has been shown previously that porcine and human GIP have identical binding affinities for the rat GIP receptor (5Wheeler M.B. Gelling R.W. McIntosh C.H.S. Georgiou J. Brown J.C. Pederson R.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4629-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).) After incubation, cell suspensions were centrifuged at 12,000 × g, the cells washed once in ice cold BB, and cell-associated radioactivity in the pellet was measured in a gamma counter. CHO-KI cells (1–5 × 105/well), plated 2 days before use in 24-well plates, were washed twice at 4 °C in BB, consisting of DMEM/F12, 20 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, and incubated for 12–16 h at 4 °C with 125I-GIP (50,000 cpm) in the presence or absence of unlabeled GIP (each concentration tested in triplicate). Cells were then washed twice in ice cold buffer, solubilized with 0.1 m NaOH (1.0 ml), and transferred to test tubes for counting of cell-associated radioactivity. Nonspecific binding for both cell types was defined as that measured in the presence of an excess of human GIP (1 μm), and specific binding was expressed as a percentage of maximum binding (%B/Bo). Receptor-expressing COS-7 cells (24 h after transfection) or CHO-K1 clones were passaged into multiwell plates and cultured for an additional 48 h. Cells were then washed in assay buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and preincubated for 60 min, followed by a 30-min stimulation period with GIP in the presence of 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA), as described previously (5Wheeler M.B. Gelling R.W. McIntosh C.H.S. Georgiou J. Brown J.C. Pederson R.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4629-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gelling R.W. Wheeler M.B. Xue J. Gyomorey S. Nian C. Pederson R.A. McIntosh C.H.S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2640-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were extracted with ice-cold 70% ethanol, and cAMP levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA). Data were expressed as a percentage of maximal levels observed with the wild type receptor (GIP-R-455) for CHO-K1 cells, and picomoles of cAMP/well for COS-7 cells. Internalization of receptor-bound ligand with wild type and truncated mutants was determined as described by Widmann et al. (32Widmann C. Dolci W. Thorens B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with BB, and incubated in the presence of 125I-GIP (50,000 cpm) for 0–120 min (in triplicate), as indicated in Fig. 6. Binding was stopped by two washes with ice-cold BB, followed by a 10-min wash in ice-cold stripping buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm glycine, pH 3.0) to remove surface bound tracer. Acid-released 125I-GIP was collected, and the cells solubilized in NaOH to determine internalized (acid resistant) radioactivity. Nonspecific binding in both fractions was determined for all time points by performing the identical experiments in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled GIP and subtracting corresponding values. The internalized 125I-GIP for each time point was expressed as a percentage of total bound (acid resistant + acid strippable). The internalization protocol used to study CHO-K1 cells stably expressing receptor constructs with serine to alanine mutations in the CT tail was based on that of Kallal et al. (34Kallal L. Gagnon A.W. Penn R.B. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and Petrou et al. (35Petrou C. Chen L. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2326-2333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with BB at 37 °C, and then incubated with 100 nm GIP for 0–60 min in triplicate, as indicated in Fig. 9. Cells were then stripped of non-internalized bound GIP by incubating with ice-cold stripping buffer (as above) for 5 min, followed by two rinses with ice-cold BB. Cells were then incubated with 125I-GIP (50,000 cpm) for 4 h at 4 °C to prevent further internalization or recycling, washed twice with ice-cold BB, and solubilized in 1 ml of NaOH for measurement of cell-associated radioactivity. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 1 μm GIP. Binding data were then expressed as percentage loss of surface receptors. Data are expressed as means ± S.E., with the number of individual experiments presented in brackets. Receptor binding and cAMP data were analyzed using the nonlinear regression analysis program PRISM (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). All data were tested for significance using analysis of variance analysis and, when appropriate, by Dunnet's test for multiple comparisons as a post-hoc test for significance. Initially, a number of truncated forms of the GIP receptor were constructed to examine the effect of progressive CT deletion on receptor expression and G-protein activation. Receptors truncated at residues 405, 418, and 425 exhibited high affinity binding in competition binding experiments, similar to that seen in cells expressing the 455-amino acid wild type receptor (GIP-R-455) in both transient studies with COS-7 cells (Figs.1 and2 A) and in stable cell lines generated in CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 2 B, TableI). Receptor expression levels, as determined from Bmax values, indicated that GIP-R-425 was expressed at least as efficiently as the wild type receptor in both cell systems (121 ± 41% in COS-7; 126 ± 34% in CHO-K1) (Table I, Fig. 1). However, cells expressing GIP-R-418 exhibited 82 ± 17% (COS-7)/74 ± 16% (CHO-K1) and those expressing GIP-R-405 36 ± 7% (COS-7)/29 ± 3% (CHO-K1) of the maximal binding obtained with the wild type receptor. This indicated that these truncated receptors were not as efficiently expressed as the longer forms of the receptor at the plasma membrane level. When the receptor was truncated at amino acid 400 (GIP-R-400) no detectable 125I-GIP binding was observed. Cells expressing GIP-R-425, GIP-R-418, and GIP-R-405 displayed similar binding affinities to that of the full-length receptor in both COS-7 and CHO-K1 cells (Figs. 1 and 2; Table I).Figure 2Binding analysis of GIP-R truncation mutants in COS-7 and CHO-K1 cells. Binding of the GIP-R mutations were examined for 125I-GIP binding in COS-7 cells expressing truncated receptor mutants (A) and in CHO-K1 cells stably expressing mutants (B).

The lack of detectable binding with GIP-R-400 suggested that either specific residues that had been deleted or a minimum CT tail length were important for receptor expression or binding. To determine whether the length of the tail was the determining factor, a sixth construct was prepared consisting of GIP-R-400 to which 5 alanine residues were added (GIP-R-400A5) to produce a similar chain length to GIP-R-405. Extension of the CT, with these nonspecific amino acid residues, restored binding in both transient and stable expression systems to levels approximating 50% of those seen for GIP-R-405 (Figs.1 and 2; Table I). Although the level of expression of this receptor was low, compared with that of the wild type receptor, both COS-7 and CHO-K1 cells expressing GIP-R-400A5 specifically bound125I-GIP with similar affinity to the wild type receptor (Figs. 1 and 2; Table I). To examine the role of the more proximal residues of the CT, two further constructions were designed, one with residues 397–405 replaced with 9 alanine residues (GIP-R-396A9), and the other with residues 397–400 deleted (GIP-R-ΔQSEI). Neither of these constructs, when transfected into COS-7 or CHO-K1 cells, displayed125I-GIP binding in competition experiments (Fig. 1; TableI). These data suggested that the CT tail length was important for efficient expression, but that specific residue(s) within the region 397–400 may also be functionally important. To assess the influence of the CT on receptor coupling to G-proteins and adenylyl cyclase, cAMP responses to GIP were determined in transfected COS-7 and CHO-K1 cells. Maximal cAMP production was greatest with GIP-R-455 in both systems. In COS-7 cells there were no significant differences in cAMP accumulation between the truncated receptor mutants GIP-R-425 (100 ± 6.5 pmol/well) or GIP-R-418 (93.4 ± 14.6 pmol/well) and the GIP-R-455 expressing cell line (104 ± 17 pmol/well) (Fig. 1, p > 0.05, n = 3). However, COS-7 cells expressing GIP-R-405 displayed significantly decreased cAMP production (60.3 ± 12.7 pmol/well) in response to GIP (Fig. 1, n = 3, p < 0.05). As would be expected from the binding experiments, GIP-R-400 did not respond to 10 nm GIP (5.3 ± 0.7 pmol/well). Of particular importance was the observation that extension of th"

There was no evidence of energy transfer between the donor and acceptor species when bound to membrane large unilamellar vesicles. These experiments led to the conclusion that the colicin E1 channel is monomeric in the membrane-bound closed channel state.

Furthermore, additional fluorescence parameters, including fluorescence emission maximum, fluorescence quantum yield, and fluorescence decay times, were used to assist in mapping the topology of the closed channel.

However, despite recent strides in the elucidation of the soluble structures of whole colicin (1Wiener M. Freymann D. Ghosh P. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and various channel domain fragments (2Parker M.W. Postma J.P. Pattus F. Tucker A.D. Tsernoglou D. J. Mol.

Structure. 1998; 6: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the current state of knowledge of the structure and function of membrane-associated colicins is modest at best. Colicin E1, secreted by Escherichia coli that possess the naturally occurring colE1 plasmid, consists of three functional domains: the translocation, receptor-binding, and channel-forming domains. Initially, the receptor-binding domain (5Brunden K.R. Uratani Y. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7682-7687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) interacts with the vitamin B12 receptor of target cells (6DiMasi D.R. White J.C. Schnaitman C.A. Bradbeer C. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 506-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After recognition, the translocation domain interacts with the tolA gene product, which permits the translocation of colicin E1 across the outer membrane and into the periplasm (7Dankert J. Uratani Y. Grabau C. Cramer W.A. Hermodson W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3857-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the periplasm the channel domain undergoes a conformational change to an insertion-competent state and then inserts spontaneously into the cytoplasmic membrane, forming an ion channel. The channel translocates monovalent ions, resulting in the dissipation of the cationic gradients (H+, K+, Na+) of the cell, causing depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane (8Gould J.M. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5491-5497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cleveland M.B. Slatin S. Finkelstein A. Levinthal C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 8706-8710Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In an effort to compensate for the membrane depolarization effected by the colicin E1 channel, Na+/K+ ATPase activity is increased in the target cell, resulting in the consumption of ATP reserves, without concomitant replenishment (10Cramer W.A. Dankert J.R. Uratani Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 737: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The final outcome is host cell death.Treatment of colicin E1 with thermolysin (11Ohno-Iwashita Y. Imahori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6446-6451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) generates a compact fragment composed of the COOH-terminal channel-forming domain, or “channel peptide,” which forms functional channels in osmotically shocked cells (10Cramer W.A. Dankert J.R. Uratani Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 737: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), membrane large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs),1 (12Peterson A.A. Cramer W.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 99: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and within planar bilayers (13Bullock J.O. Cohen F.S. Dankert J.R. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9908-9912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before insertion into model membrane systems, low pH-induced activation (14Merrill A.R. Steer B.A. Prentice G.A. Weller M.J. Szabo A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6874-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) is required.Previous studies have generated evidence in support of both a monomeric and an oligomeric colicin E1 channel; however, the number of channel-forming domains required to form a functional colicin E1 channel has not been clearly established. In favor of a monomeric channel, Jacob et al. (15Jacob F. Siminovitch L. Wollman E. Ann. Inst. Pasteur. 1952; 83: 295-315PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that cytotoxicity is first order with respect to colicin E1 concentration and proposed that a single channel is capable of killing a cell. In addition, the in vivo (16Wendt L. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 104: 1236-1241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitro (17Bruggemann E.P. Kayalar C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4273-4276Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) efflux of K+ and intravesicular markers through colicin E1 channels also obey first-order kinetics. The implications of these kinetic studies were confirmed by Levinthal and co-workers (18Levinthal F. Todd A.P. Hubbell W.L. Levinthal C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), who demonstrated a 1:1 stoichiometry for active peptides forming channels in both small unilamellar vesicles and LUVs based on the discharge of a membrane potential in these target membrane systems. Also, steady-state conductance through colicin E1 channels is linear with respect to colicin E1 concentration (12Peterson A.A. Cramer W.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 99: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Finally, ultracentrifugation sedimentation equilibrium studies (19Schwartz S.A. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6318-6327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hydrodynamic Stokes radii comparison (20Merrill A.R. Cohen F.S. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5829-5836Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) indicated that colicin E1 is monomeric in solution over a broad pH range.Despite this evidence in support of a monomeric channel, the ability of the colicin E1 channel to accommodate large organic molecules, including NAD+ (21Raymond L. Slatin S. Finkelstein A. Liu Q.R. Levinthal C. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 92: 255-268Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), is not easily reconcilable with a monomeric structure. Carboxyl-terminal colicin E1 peptides, with as few as 88 amino acid residues, can form modestly functional channels in vitro (22Liu Q.W. Crozel V. Levinthal F. Slatin S. Finkelstein A. Levinthal C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1986; 1: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); however, it is unlikely that a channel formed by such a short fragment would have a diameter sufficient to permit the passage of large organic molecules. More recently, the dimensions of the colicin Ia channel were mapped using a method based on the filling of the channel by nonelectrolytes from either side of the membrane. The channel was found to have cis and trans entrance diameters of 18 and 10 Å, respectively, with a constriction size of 7 Å (23Krasilnikov O.V. Da Cruz J.B. Yuldasheva L.N. Varanda W.A. Nogueira R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Notably, a channel with such a large lumen is not consistent with a two- or four-helix bundle assembled from a monomeric protein.The colicin E1 channel peptide is a globular protein that consists of 10 α-helices organized into three layers (3Elkins P. Bunker A. Cramer W.A. Stauffacher C.V. Structure. 1997; 5: 443-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Layer A is composed of helices 1, 2, and 10; layer B contains helices 8 and 9; and layer C contains helices 3, 4, 6, and 7. Helices 5a and 5b transverse part of the protein structure by running across the layers and are not included in any of the designated layers. The orientation of the channel domain helices in the membrane-bound state of the channel peptide has been the subject of a number of investigations. Hydrophobic helices 8 and 9 and the loop connecting them have been proposed to create a hydrophobic hairpin anchor for the induction of the membrane channel (24Cramer W.A. Heymann J.B. Schendel S.L. Deriy B.N. Cohen F.S. Elkins P.A. Stauffacher C.V. Annu. Rev. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Stroud R.M. Reiling K. Wiener M. Freymann D. Structure. 1998; 8: 525-533Google Scholar). A model for colicin A has been proposed wherein most helices open like an “umbrella” on the surface of the membrane (26Parker M.W. Tucker A.D. Tsernoglou D. Pattus F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 126-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). An alternate model, called the “penknife model,” has been suggested which proposes that helices 8 and 9 only partially penetrate into the membrane bilayer (27Lakey J.H. Duche D. Gonzales-Manas J.M. Baty D. Pattus F. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 218: 639-653Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 28Massotte D. Yamamoto M. Scianimanico S. Sorokine O. Van Dorsselaer A.Y. Ourisson G. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13787-13794Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).In an earlier study, Palmer and Merrill (29Palmer L.R. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4187-4193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used nitroxide-labeled phospholipids as fluorescence quench probes to determine the membrane depths of Trp residues in single Trp mutant proteins of the colicin E1 channel peptide by a parallax analysis method (30Chattopadhyay A. London E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Recently, this experimental approach was extended in an investigation where a new shallower, nitroxide quencher (attached to the phospholipid headgroup) (31Malenbaum S.E. Merrill A.R. London E. J. Nat. Toxins. 1998; 7: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar) was used as an additional quench species to probe Trp depths within the membrane bilayer. In the latter report, it was suggested that helices 8 and 9 are embedded in the membrane in a tilted fashion and do not protrude through the bilayer to the trans side. It was also found that the bilayer thickness could affect the structure of the colicin E1 channel domain in the membrane.In the present investigation, one goal was to use fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in an attempt to reconcile the dispute over whether the colicin E1 channel is monomeric or oligomeric. A second objective was to use the water-soluble fluorescence quencher, acrylamide, to probe the solvent accessibility of Trp residues within the membrane-bound state of the colicin E1 channel domain. The second objective was rendered achievable by the use of single Trp mutant channel proteins of colicin E1 as characterized previously (31Malenbaum S.E. Merrill A.R. London E. J. Nat. Toxins. 1998; 7: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar, 32Steer B.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7225-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The fluorescence quench data were also correlated with various other Trp fluorescence parameters for the Trp mutant proteins, including fluorescence lifetimes, fluorescence quantum yields, and fluorescence emission maxima (λemmax) values. The cytotoxic function of the bactericidal protein colicin E1 is found in the ability of the protein to form voltage-gated, ion-conductive channels within the cytoplasmic membrane of susceptible cells. However, despite recent strides in the elucidation of the soluble structures of whole colicin (1Wiener M. Freymann D. Ghosh P. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and various channel domain fragments (2Parker M.W. Postma J.P. Pattus F. Tucker A.D. Tsernoglou D. J. Mol.

Previous studies have generated evidence in support of both a monomeric and an oligomeric colicin E1 channel; however, the number of channel-forming domains required to form a functional colicin E1 channel has not been clearly established. In favor of a monomeric channel, Jacob et al. (15Jacob F. Siminovitch L. Wollman E. Ann. Inst. Pasteur. 1952; 83: 295-315PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that cytotoxicity is first order with respect to colicin E1 concentration and proposed that a single channel is capable of killing a cell. In addition, the in vivo (16Wendt L. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 104: 1236-1241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitro (17Bruggemann E.P. Kayalar C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4273-4276Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) efflux of K+ and intravesicular markers through colicin E1 channels also obey first-order kinetics. The implications of these kinetic studies were confirmed by Levinthal and co-workers (18Levinthal F. Todd A.P. Hubbell W.L. Levinthal C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), who demonstrated a 1:1 stoichiometry for active peptides forming channels in both small unilamellar vesicles and LUVs based on the discharge of a membrane potential in these target membrane systems. Also, steady-state conductance through colicin E1 channels is linear with respect to colicin E1 concentration (12Peterson A.A. Cramer W.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 99: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Finally, ultracentrifugation sedimentation equilibrium studies (19Schwartz S.A. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6318-6327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hydrodynamic Stokes radii comparison (20Merrill A.R. Cohen F.S. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5829-5836Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) indicated that colicin E1 is monomeric in solution over a broad pH range. Despite this evidence in support of a monomeric channel, the ability of the colicin E1 channel to accommodate large organic molecules, including NAD+ (21Raymond L. Slatin S. Finkelstein A. Liu Q.R. Levinthal C. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 92: 255-268Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), is not easily reconcilable with a monomeric structure. Carboxyl-terminal colicin E1 peptides, with as few as 88 amino acid residues, can form modestly functional channels in vitro (22Liu Q.W. Crozel V. Levinthal F. Slatin S. Finkelstein A. Levinthal C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1986; 1: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); however, it is unlikely that a channel formed by such a short fragment would have a diameter sufficient to permit the passage of large organic molecules. More recently, the dimensions of the colicin Ia channel were mapped using a method based on the filling of the channel by nonelectrolytes from either side of the membrane. The channel was found to have cis and trans entrance diameters of 18 and 10 Å, respectively, with a constriction size of 7 Å (23Krasilnikov O.V. Da Cruz J.B. Yuldasheva L.N. Varanda W.A. Nogueira R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Notably, a channel with such a large lumen is not consistent with a two- or four-helix bundle assembled from a monomeric protein. The colicin E1 channel peptide is a globular protein that consists of 10 α-helices organized into three layers (3Elkins P. Bunker A. Cramer W.A. Stauffacher C.V. Structure. 1997; 5: 443-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Layer A is composed of helices 1, 2, and 10; layer B contains helices 8 and 9; and layer C contains helices 3, 4, 6, and 7. Helices 5a and 5b transverse part of the protein structure by running across the layers and are not included in any of the designated layers. The orientation of the channel domain helices in the membrane-bound state of the channel peptide has been the subject of a number of investigations. Hydrophobic helices 8 and 9 and the loop connecting them have been proposed to create a hydrophobic hairpin anchor for the induction of the membrane channel (24Cramer W.A. Heymann J.B. Schendel S.L. Deriy B.N. Cohen F.S. Elkins P.A. Stauffacher C.V. Annu. Rev. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Stroud R.M. Reiling K. Wiener M. Freymann D. Structure. 1998; 8: 525-533Google Scholar). A model for colicin A has been proposed wherein most helices open like an “umbrella” on the surface of the membrane (26Parker M.W. Tucker A.D. Tsernoglou D. Pattus F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 126-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). An alternate model, called the “penknife model,” has been suggested which proposes that helices 8 and 9 only partially penetrate into the membrane bilayer (27Lakey J.H. Duche D. Gonzales-Manas J.M. Baty D. Pattus F. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 218: 639-653Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 28Massotte D. Yamamoto M. Scianimanico S. Sorokine O. Van Dorsselaer A.Y. Ourisson G. Pattus F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13787-13794Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In an earlier study, Palmer and Merrill (29Palmer L.R. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4187-4193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used nitroxide-labeled phospholipids as fluorescence quench probes to determine the membrane depths of Trp residues in single Trp mutant proteins of the colicin E1 channel peptide by a parallax analysis method (30Chattopadhyay A. London E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Recently, this experimental approach was extended in an investigation where a new shallower, nitroxide quencher (attached to the phospholipid headgroup) (31Malenbaum S.E. Merrill A.R. London E. J. Nat. Toxins. 1998; 7: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar) was used as an additional quench species to probe Trp depths within the membrane bilayer. In the latter report, it was suggested that helices 8 and 9 are embedded in the membrane in a tilted fashion and do not protrude through the bilayer to the trans side. It was also found that the bilayer thickness could affect the structure of the colicin E1 channel domain in the membrane. In the present investigation, one goal was to use fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in an attempt to reconcile the dispute over whether the colicin E1 channel is monomeric or oligomeric. A second objective was to use the water-soluble fluorescence quencher, acrylamide, to probe the solvent accessibility of Trp residues within the membrane-bound state of the colicin E1 channel domain. The second objective was rendered achievable by the use of single Trp mutant channel proteins of colicin E1 as characterized previously (31Malenbaum S.E. Merrill A.R. London E. J. Nat. Toxins. 1998; 7: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar, 32Steer B.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7225-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The fluorescence quench data were also correlated with various other Trp fluorescence parameters for the Trp mutant proteins, including fluorescence lifetimes, fluorescence quantum yields, and fluorescence emission maxima (λemmax) values.

Ketelslegers J.M. Underwood L.E. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 81-101Google Scholar). Hepatic production of IGFs appears to be regulated at pretranslational levels, as indicated by the strong correlations between circulating IGFs and abundance of hepatic IGF-I and -II mRNA (2Rivero F. Goya L. Aláez C. Pascual-Leone A.M. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 145: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 3Goya L. Rivero F. Martín M.A. Arahuetes R. Hernández E.R. Pascual-Leone A.M. Am. J.

Secretion of both IGFs in adult animals is mainly regulated by growth hormone (GH), but nutritional status and serum insulin concentration are important factors involved in the regulation of IGF synthesis and secretion (1Thissen J.P. Ketelslegers J.M. Underwood L.E. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 81-101Google Scholar, 2Rivero F. Goya L. Aláez C. Pascual-Leone A.M. J.

Previous work “in vivo” has shown that a balanced insulin/nutrients ratio regulates IGFs secretion during the perinatal period of the rat, when the IGF response to GH is not yet well established (2Rivero F. Goya L. Aláez C. Pascual-Leone A.M. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 145: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that refeeding and insulin treatment of undernourished and diabetic neonatal rats, respectively, lead to a recovery of serum and liver mRNA expression of IGF-I and -II without a prior increase in serum GH (3Goya L. Rivero F. Martín M.A. Arahuetes R. Hernández E.R. Pascual-Leone A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E223-E231PubMed Google Scholar). These in vivo experiments strongly suggest that during the perinatal period of the rat, IGFs regulation is GH-independent, supporting the role of insulin and nutrients. However, in experiments in vivo the simultaneous fluctuations of fuels and hormones that occur in diabetic and undernourished animals make it difficult to demonstrate specific regulation. It seemed appropriate, therefore, to investigate “in vitro” the underlying mechanisms for IGFs regulation. The in vitro system that most closely resembles normal developing liver is the primary culture of fetal hepatocytes (5Lorenzo M. Roncero C. Benito M. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Roncero C. Lorenzo M. Fabregat I. Benito M. Biochim. Biophys.

Since IGF expression in primary fetal cultures is limited and subject to plastic substratum-induced changes in the differentiation state of the liver cells, very scant data are available in the literature about the IGF response of fetal hepatocytes in culture to different conditions (8Rechler M.M. Eisen H.J. Higa O.Z. Nissley S.P. Moses A.C. Schilling E.E. Fennoy I. Bruni C.B. Phillips L.S. Baird K.L. J. Biol.

To overcome these difficulties, a selective primary culture of fetal rat hepatocytes was established in our laboratory in order to show unequivocally the specific effect of different factors and conditions on IGF-I and -II gene expression during the mammalian perinatal period, as well as to elucidate their molecular mechanism of action. Gene expression, determined by the highly sensitive RNase protection assay, and peptide secretion of IGF-I and -II were assayed in cultures of hepatocytes from rat fetuses on day 21 of gestation in the presence of serum, GH, and glucose. In this model we report that fetal rat hepatocytes retain some of the characteristics of the rat fetal liver while maintained in short term culture, i.e. rat fetal hepatocytes synthesize and secrete IGFs to the culture medium. The results also demonstrate, for the first time, the specific regulatory role of glucose on IGF-I and -II gene expression during late fetal stages of perinatal development. This system should be a useful tool for further studies of molecular mechanisms of IGF-I and -II regulation. Recombinant human IGF-I and -II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used as standard and for iodination. RNase A and RNase T1 were also purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Na125I and Hyperfilm-MP autoradiography film were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Polyclonal antiserum (lot K9147-48) raised in rabbit against human IGF-I and the C-terminal fragment (residues 57–70) was purchased from KabiGen AB (Stockholm, Sweden). [32P]UTP was purchased from ICN (Nuclear Ibérica S.A., Madrid, Spain). Riboprobe Gemini II Core System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was used for the generation of RNA probes. Cycloheximide, actinomycin D, and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. Doxorubicin hydrochloride was purchased from Aldrich. Fetal calf serum (FCS), medium 199 (M199), and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were purchased from BioWhittaker (Ingelheim Diagnóstica y Tecnología, Madrid, Spain). Wistar rats bred in our laboratory with controlled temperature and artificial dark-light cycle were used throughout the study. Females were caged with males and mating was confirmed by the presence of spermatozoa in a vaginal smear. Each dam was housed individually from the 14th day of pregnancy. Animals were fed a standard laboratory diet ad libitum. Water was given ad libitum. Dams were sacrificed and fetuses were exposed after abdominal incision. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the principles and procedures outlined in the National Institutes of Health Guide for care and use of experimental animals (Bethesda). Primary cultures of hepatocytes from 21-day-old Wistar rat fetuses were prepared by a non-perfusion collagenase dispersion method (5Lorenzo M. Roncero C. Benito M. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The protocol involves incubation of the minced tissue with Ca2+-free Krebs bicarbonate buffer containing 0.5 mm EGTA in a 150-ml conical flask for 30 min at 37 °C in a shaking water bath (100 cycles/min) under continuous gassing (O2/CO2, 19:1). The cell suspension was centrifuged at 50 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. Cells were then resuspended in Krebs bicarbonate buffer containing 2.55 mm Ca2+ and 0.5 mg of collagenase/ml in a 150-ml conical flask. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C in a shaking water bath (100 cycles/min) under continuous gassing. After 60 min, the cell suspension was washed with Krebs bicarbonate buffer containing 2.55 mm Ca2+ and then centrifuged at 35 × g for 5 min and filtered through a nylon mesh (500 μm). The washing step was repeated with a nylon mesh of 100 μm. During washings at very low speed and separation occurred between parenchymal and hematopoietic cells, the latter mostly remaining in suspension. By counting under a microscope, hematopoietic cell contamination was shown to be lower than 5%. The procedure produced ∼1.5 × 107 cells/g of fetal liver, representing about a 15% recovery yield. Cell viability (trypan blue exclusion) for fetal hepatocytes was always higher than 95%. isolation of adult hepatocytes was carried out from 3-month-old male rats by perfusion with collagenase in Krebs/bicarbonate buffer under continuous gassing with carbogen (O2/CO2, 19:1). The hepatocyte suspension was washed twice with sterile Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then resuspended in this medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 50 μg/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For culture of fetal cells sterile techniques were used throughout the procedure, and media were supplemented with 120 μg of penicillin-G/ml, 100 μg streptomycin/ml. The isolated cells were plated in 100-mm diameter plastic dishes containing 8 ml of medium 199 with Earle's salts supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and antibiotics as described above. Each dish was inoculated with 6 × 106 cells, and the primary culture was kept at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air with 80% humidity in a cell incubator for 4 h. Then the attached monolayer of cells was washed with serum-free medium, and fresh FCS/free medium supplemented with the various different conditions was added and the dishes incubated either for 3 or 16 h. The use of this procedure ensures a fairly pure culture of fetal hepatocytes in which the fibroblast-like cells comprise less than 10% of the total cells (6Roncero C. Lorenzo M. Fabregat I. Benito M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1012: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 3 × 106 hepatocytes were plated in 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes in a medium containing 8 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 4 h incubation to facilitate cell attachment to the matrix, the medium was aspirated, and the plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove the nonadherent cells and filled with 8 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking serum. Additions were made so that the changes in the total incubation volume were less than 2%. Recombinant human IGF-I and IGF-II were labeled by a modified chloramine-T method (2Rivero F. Goya L. Aláez C. Pascual-Leone A.M. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 145: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 3Goya L. Rivero F. Martín M.A. Arahuetes R. Hernández E.R. Pascual-Leone A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E223-E231PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity achieved with this method was approximately 90–175 μCi/μg for both peptides. Prior to IGF-I and -II determination, culture medium was concentrated, and serum IGFBPs were removed by standard acid gel filtration. This method has proved to be the most reliable one for use with rat serum (2Rivero F. Goya L. Aláez C. Pascual-Leone A.M. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 145: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 3Goya L. Rivero F. Martín M.A. Arahuetes R. Hernández E.R. Pascual-Leone A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E223-E231PubMed Google Scholar). The radioimmunoassay (RIA) for IGF-I and rat liver membrane receptor assay (RRA) for IGF-II were carried out as described previously (2Rivero F. Goya L. Aláez C. Pascual-Leone A.M. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 145: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,3Goya L. Rivero F. Martín M.A. Arahuetes R. Hernández E.R. Pascual-Leone A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E223-E231PubMed Google Scholar). The coefficients of variation within assay and between assay were 8.0 and 12.4%, respectively. Cultured hepatocytes were separated from the plastic substrate with a rubber policeman, and total RNA was prepared by homogenization of cells in guanidinium thiocyanate as originally described (12Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA was re-precipitated for purification, and its concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Samples were electrophoresed through 1.1% agarose, 2.2 mol of formaldehyde/liter gels and stained with ethidium bromide in order to render the 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA-visible and thereby confirm the integrity of the RNA and normalize the quantity of RNA in the different lanes. A β-actin probe (0.6-kilobase pair Eco RI/Hin dIII fragment isolated from the VC18 vector kindly provided by Dr. P. Martín-Sanz from Instituto de Bioquímica, CSIC, Madrid, Spain) was used in a Northern blot assay in order to validate the ethidium bromide method for loading normalization. Nuclear pellets were extracted from 10 × 106 cells. Hepatocytes were removed from the plates with a rubber policeman in phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 s. Cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, and then vortexed for 10 s. Samples were centrifuged for 15 s at 15,000 rpm, and the nuclear pellets were homogenized on ice in a solution containing 4m guanidine thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.5% Sarkosyl, and 0.1 m 2-mercapthoethanol. Purification, precipitation, and quantification of the nuclear-enriched RNA were as described above for total RNA. Rat IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP3 cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. E. Hernández (Instituto de Bioquímica, CSIC, Madrid, Spain), Dr. C. T. Roberts, and Dr. D. LeRoith (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Rat IGF-I cDNA ligated into a pGEM-3 plasmid (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI) was linearized with HindIII, and an antisense riboprobe was produced by T7 RNA polymerase generating two protected fragments of 224 bases (Ia) and 386 bases (Ib). Rat IGF-II cDNA ligated into a pGEM-3 plasmid was linearized with Hin dIII and incubated with T7 RNA polymerase to generate a riboprobe that recognized a protected fragment of 500 bases. Rat IGFBP3 cDNA ligated into a pGEM-4Z plasmid was linearized with Acc I, and use was made of T7 RNA polymerase to generate a 343-base-long antisense riboprobe. Solution hybridization/RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (13Lowe W.L. Roberts C.T. Lasky S.R. LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8946-8950Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of total liver RNA were hybridized with 500,000 cpm of the 32P-labeled riboprobes described above for 18 h at 45 °C in 75% formamide and 400 mmol of NaCl/liter. After RNase digestion with a buffer containing 40 μg of RNase A/ml and 2 μg of RNase T1/ml for 1 h at 37 °C, protected RNA-RNA hybrids were resolved on denaturing 8% polyacrylamide and 8 mol of urea/liter gels. Autoradiography was performed at −70 °C against an Hyperfilm MP film between intensifying screens. Bands representing protected probe fragments were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics scanning densitometer and accompanying software. Fetal hepatocytes were cultured with 0.01 μminsulin in the absence or presence of 20 mm glucose for 16 h. Then at time 0, 1 μg/ml doxorubicin and 0.01 μm insulin were added to fresh medium with or without 20 mm glucose and cultures stopped at different time points. Total RNA was processed as above, and IGF-I and -II mRNA expression was determined by RPA. Data are presented as means ± S.D. Statistical comparisons were performed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by the protected least significant difference test (3Goya L. Rivero F. Martín M.A. Arahuetes R. Hernández E.R. Pascual-Leone A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E223-E231PubMed Google Scholar). In order to establish the basic conditions of the fetal hepatocyte in culture, the response of IGF-I and -II gene expression to 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), glucose, or stimulating doses of GH in the medium was evaluated. Fetal hepatocytes cultured in the presence of FCS/free plain essential M199 medium were used as untreated controls (Fig. 1 A, column C). Treatment with 10% FCS for 16 h provoked an increase in the abundance of IGF-I and -II mRNA transcripts (Fig.1 A, column S), an effect directly dependent on serum factors and not on the amount of protein present in the medium as demonstrated by the lack of effect of an equivalent amount of bovine serum albumin (Fig. 1 A, column A). In a time course response experiment, increased IGF-I and -II mRNA expression induced by 16 h treatment with 10% FCS (time 0) decayed faster in FCS-free conditions (Fig. 1 A, −serum columns in the right panel) than in the presence of 10% FCS (Fig. 1 A, +serum columns in same panel) which maintained higher levels of both transcripts at 9 and 16 h of culture. Therefore, in order to avoid the stimulating effect of serum, the remaining experiments were carried out in the absence of FCS, and the culture cell viability in the absence of serum was ensured for at least 24 h. No significant effect on IGF-I and -II was observed when fetal hepatocytes were treated with increasing concentrations of glucose (0–20 mm) added to the serum-free medium in the absence of any other factor (Fig. 1 B). In all experiments, at similar time exposures of films, IGF-II transcript abundance in fetal hepatocytes was at least 5-fold higher than that of IGF-I, in agreement with the fact that IGF-II is reputed to be the major IGF in fetal stages. The IGF-I and -II mRNA response of fetal hepatocytes to increasing doses of GH was assayed and compared with the response of adult hepatocytes in order to test GH as a regulatory factor of IGFs during the fetal period (Fig. 2). As expected, no induction of IGF-I and -II gene expression was observed in cultures of fetal hepatocytes treated for 16 h with different doses of GH (5–50 ng/ml) (Fig. 2 A); however, the same GH concentrations evoked a significant increase of IGF-I and IGFBP3 gene expression in cultures of adult hepatocytes (Fig. 2 B), supporting the idea that factors other than GH might regulate IGFs gene expression at fetal stages. Although glucose per se had no significant effect on IGF gene expression, when a minimal non-stimulating dose of 0.01 μminsulin 2L. Goya, A. de la Puente, S. Ramos, M. A. Martín, C. Alvarez, and A. M.

The glucose-induced stimulation was more evident for IGF-II than for IGF-I in all cases (optical density units in densitometric figures do not represent actual values since arbitrary units were averaged from different films with distinct time exposures). A gradual dose-response increase was observed for IGF-II at 3 and 16 h and for IGF-I at 16 h, while 20 mmglucose evoked the greatest increase of IGF-I and -II mRNA transcripts at both time points. Moreover, in a time course experiment, 20 mm glucose stimulated mRNA expression as soon as 30 min for IGF-II and 1 h for IGF-I after the onset of treatment and remained significantly elevated throughout the experiment (Fig.4). Similar doses of glucose and insulin had no effect on IGF-I gene expression in cultures of adult hepatocytes (data not shown).Figure 4Time course effect of glucose on IGF-I and -II in cultures of fetal hepatocytes.

In order to evaluate the IGF peptide secretion, fetal hepatocytes were treated with increasing doses of glucose for 16 h or with 20 mm glucose for different times, and the conditioned medium was assayed for IGF-I (radioimmunoassay) and IGF-II (radioreceptor assay). A slight but significant dose-response increase of IGF-I and -II peptide levels in the medium was found at 10 and 20 mm glucose. Besides, a time-dependent increase in IGF-I and -II peptide levels in the medium was observed starting 30 min after the onset of the treatment with 20 mm glucose (Table I). IGF-II values in the conditioned medium were ∼10-fold higher than those of IGF-I, which agrees with the higher mRNA expression of IGF-II in these fetal hepatocyte cultures.Table I16-h dose response and time course effect of glucose on IGF-I and -II peptide secretion to the conditioned mediaDose (mm)051020IGF-I (ng/ml)11.3 ± 0.112.4 ± 0.814.9 ± 1.21-ap < 0.05 relative to 0 dose or 0 time.17.0 ± 0.71-ap < 0.05 relative to 0 dose or 0 time.IGF-II (ng/ml)87.5 ± 15.1120.2 ± 21.2154.7 ± 30.01-ap < 0.05 relative to 0 dose or 0 time.197.5 ± 8.21-ap < 0.05 relative to 0 dose or 0 time.,1-bp < 0.05 relative to the prior dose or period.Time course (h)01/21248IGF-I (ng/ml)9.8 ± 1.312.4 ± 0.21-ap < 0.05 relative to 0 dose or 0 time.14.1 ± 0.61-ap < 0.05 relative to 0 dose or 0 time.14.4 ± 0.81-ap < 0.05 relative to 0 dose or 0 time.18.5 ± 2.11-ap < 0.05 relative to 0 dose or 0 time.,1-bp < 0.05 relative to the prior dose or period.22.4 ± 6.41-ap < 0.05 relative to 0 dose or 0 time.IGF-II (ng/ml)57.3 ± 5.2114.0 ± 21.01-ap < 0.05 relative to 0 dose or 0 time.115.0 ± 2.71-ap < 0.05 relative to 0 dose or 0 time.169.3 ± 44.01-ap < 0.05 relative to 0 dose or 0 time.,1-bp < 0.05 relative to the prior dose or period.182.0 ± 10.81-ap < 0.05 relative to 0 dose or 0 time.206.0 ± 26.51-ap < 0.05 relative to 0 dose or 0 time.IGF-I was assayed by RIA and IGF-II by RRA.

Open table in a new tab IGF-I was assayed by RIA and IGF-II by RRA. Mean ± S.D. of 3–4 different experiments is shown. When IGF peptide levels (expressed in ng/ml) were correlated with IGF mRNA transcript abundance (expressed in arbitrary units of optical density of RNA bands) obtained from the glucose dose-response experiments, a good correlation was found for both IGF-I (r = 0.976) and -II (r = 0.923) (Fig.5). As a first approach to investigate the mechanism of action of glucose on IGF mRNA expression in fetal hepatocytes the following experiments were carried out. Incubation with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 16 h, a protein synthesis inhibitor, did not prevent but did reduce the glucose-induced mRNA levels of both IGF-I and -II (Fig.6 A). Incubation with 10 μg/ml of the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D for 16 h did not change the transcript levels of IGF-I and -II (Fig. 6 A). Two different glucose analogs, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) and 3-O-methylglucose (3-OMG), were used to investigate the intracellular pathway where glucose stimulates IGF gene expression. 2-DOG is capable of being metabolized to 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate but no further, whereas 3-OMG cannot undergo phosphorylation. A 16-h incubation with doses of 2-DOG, similar to those of glucose previously used, induced a significant increase in IGF-II mRNA transcript abundance and a slight increase in IGF-I (Fig. 6 B). However, incubation of the cultures with the same doses of 3-OMG for 16 h evoked no change in either transcript (Fig. 6 B). Transcript stability and transcriptional activity were assayed to delineate the level of action of glucose on IGF-I and -II gene expression. Transcript stability was measured in decay experiments by inducing IGF mRNA transcripts with 20 mm glucose for 16 h and then adding 1 μg/ml doxorubicin at time 0; mRNA was extracted after different times in the absence (−glucose) or presence (+glucose) of 20 mm glucose, and the results are shown in Fig.7. Increases in IGF-I and -II transcript stability were observed during the 1st h of treatment with doxorubicin versus treatment with the RNA synthesis inhibitor plus glucose, but from that time on the decrease of IGF-I and -II transcripts was faster in the absence than in the presence of glucose. Statistical differences between levels of mRNA abundance in the presence and absence of glucose were found at 0, 0.5, 2, 4, and 6 h for IGF-I and at all times for IGF-II. The transcriptional effect of glucose was determined by the RNase protection assay of nuclear transcripts, a method reported to yield fairly accurate transcriptional activity (see “Discussion”). As a control test, stimulating doses of insulin provoked a large increase in IGF-I nuclear transcripts in cultures of adult hepatocytes (Fig.8 A). The use of this method revealed an increase of IGF-II gene transcription when fetal hepatocytes were treated with 20 mm glucose for 3 h, whereas no significant changes in nuclear transcripts were observed when treated with 5 and 10 mm glucose (Fig. 8 B). Finally, no significant effect of glucose was observed in IGF-I under similar conditions (Fig. 8 B).Figure 8Transcriptional effect of glucose on IGF-I and -II gene expression.

The unique ability of cyanide to inhibit aa3-type cytochrome oxidase is extremely important for investigating the enzyme complexes of the biological respiratory chain (2Wilson D.F. Erecinska M. Fleischer S. Leaster P. Methods in Enzymology. 53. Academic Press, New York1978: 191-197Google Scholar). Cyanide has long been known to serve as a ligand for the heme a3 based on its ability to change the visible spectral characteristics of the heme environment (3Erecinska M. Wilson D.F. Sato N.

Kinetic and mechanistic questions relating to the reaction of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO)1 with cyanide have been the subject of many recent experiments (5Baker G.M. Noguchi M. Palmer G. J. Biol.

In addition to inhibiting hemoprotein-catalyzed reactions, cyanide is actively metabolized to carbon dioxide in biological systems (8Castric P.A. Vennesland B. Conn E.E. Knowles C.J. Westley J.

A similar result was also reported in the study of lignin peroxidase H2 from the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium (14Shah M.M. Grover T.A. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem.

Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) because of its ability to block oxidative phosphorylation and thereby induce the production of reactive oxygen species. Cyanide-induced neurotoxicity and oxidative stress have also recently received much attention (20Gunasekar P.G. Sun P.W. Kanthasamy A.G. Borowitz J.L. Isom G.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 150-155PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gunasekar P.G. Borowitz J.L. Isom G.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 236-241PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that cyanide can activate the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors for signal transduction (22Yang C.W. Borowitz J.L. Gunasekar P.G. Isom G.E. J. Biochem.

Azide also exhibits inhibitory effects on the mitochondrial CcO (2Wilson D.F. Erecinska M. Fleischer S. Leaster P. Methods in Enzymology. 53. Academic Press, New York1978: 191-197Google Scholar) and other hemoproteins such as catalase (24Deisseroth A. Dounce A.L. Physiol.

The inhibition of purified CcO by azide was moderately strong (26Palmer G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and kinetically different from that caused by cyanide (27Yonetani T. Ray G.S. J. Biol.

The property of azide to selectively inhibit the CcO of the electron transport chain in mitochondria has prompted researchers to use azide infusion to investigate mitochondrial dysfunction-related diseases such as hypoxia/ischemia and Alzheimer's disease (28Bennett M.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3320-3326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). More recently, a high resolution x-ray structure of azide-bound CcO has been reported (33Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P. Mizushima T. Yamaguchi H. Tomizaki T. Tsukihara T. Science. 1998; 280: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar), providing information to help in understanding the mechanism of azide inhibition. Like the cyanyl radical, the azidyl radical (⋅N3) can be formed by one-electron oxidation of azide and detected by the ESR spin-trapping technique (34Kalyanaraman B. Janzen E.G. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4003-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier research indicated that the oxidation of azide to the azidyl radical can be catalyzed by various peroxidases in the presence of H2O2 (34Kalyanaraman B. Janzen E.G. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4003-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This azidyl radical was later demonstrated to be covalently incorporated into the prosthetic group of peroxidases, resulting in its inactivation (35Ortiz de Montellano P.R. David S.K. Ator M.A. Tew D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5470-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this investigation, we report for the first time the detection of cyanyl radical during the inhibition of CcO with KCN. We point out that as-isolated CcO was capable of oxidizing cyanide to cyanyl radical in the absence of added H2O2. In contrast, as-isolated CcO showed little capability of oxidizing azide to azidyl radical, but produced readily detectable amounts of azidyl radicals in the presence of H2O2. K13CN was purchased from MSD Isotopes (Montreal, Canada), and 15N3-labeled NaN3 was from Stohler Isotope Chemicals (Waltham, MA). The 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) spin trap was purchased from Aldrich and was vacuum-distilled twice and stored under nitrogen at −70 °C until needed. The cytochrome c was reduced with ascorbic acid and then passed through a Sephadex G-25 column before use. All reactions used 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, Chelexed overnight, with 200 μm DTPA added after Chelex treatment. Highly purified bovine heart mitochondrial CcO was isolated using the method developed by Yu et al. (36Yu C.A., Yu, L. King T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1383-1392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Submitochondrial particles were used as starting material and subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation in the presence of 1.5% sodium cholate. Optical spectra of CcO were recorded in a SLM AMINCO DW2000 spectrophotometer. The enzyme concentration (per aa3) of CcO was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 24 mm−1 cm−1 for the dithionite reduced-minus-oxidized form at 605 nm (36Yu C.A., Yu, L. King T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1383-1392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CcO, isolated as the fast form (5Baker G.M. Noguchi M. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 595-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contained 7–8 μg of phospholipid and 10–12 nmol of heme a/mg protein. The concentration of compound P (peroxy form) or compound F (ferryloxo form) of CcO was calculated from the difference spectrum [(compound P or compound F) −(as-isolated CcO)] using extinction coefficients of ΔA607–630 = 11 mm−1cm−1 for compound P and ΔA580–630 = 5.3 mm−1cm−1 for compound F (7Fabian M. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1534-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ESR experiments were carried out on a Bruker ESP 300 ESR spectrometer operating at 9.8 GHz with 100 kHz modulation frequency at room temperature. The reaction mixtures were transferred to a 17-mm quartz ESR flat cell, which was then positioned into the TM110 microwave cavity. The sample was scanned using the following parameters: center field, 3480 G; modulation amplitude, 1.0 G; time constant, 0.33 s; scan time, 335 s for a 100-G scan; gain, 1 × 105; and microwave power, 20 mW. The spectral simulations were performed using the WinSim program of the NIEHS public ESR software package. The ESR spectrum recorded after 1 h from a reaction mixture containing 0.2 mm CcO, 10 mm KCN, and 100 mm DMPO was simulated as a combination of two DMPO radical adducts (Fig. 1 A). The first adduct was assigned to DMPO/cyanyl radical adduct (DMPO/⋅CN) based on the hyperfine coupling constants a N = 15.43 and a Hβ = 18.90 G (Fig. 1 B) (12Moreno S.N.J. Stolze K. Janzen E.G. Mason R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The second adduct was assigned to DMPO/hydroxyl radical adduct (DMPO/⋅OH) based on the hyperfine coupling constants a N = 15.0 and a Hβ = 14.75 G (Fig. 1 C) (37Buettner G.R. Mason R.P. Packer L. Glazer A.N. Methods in Enzymology. 186. Academic Press, New York1990: 127-133Google Scholar). In the absence of CcO (Fig.2 B) or in the presence of heat-denatured (100 °C for 30 min) CcO (data not shown), DMPO/⋅CN was not detected. The nucleophilic addition of CN− to DMPO could form an ESR-silent hydroxylamine that would be expected to facilely air oxidize to DMPO/⋅CN (38Forrester A.R. Hepburn S.P. J. Chem. Soc. 1971; (Lond.) (C): 701-703Google Scholar). This enzymatic dependence of DMPO/⋅CN formation supports a direct role of CcO in the oxidation of CN− to ⋅CN. The DMPO/⋅OH adduct was detected in the absence of CcO and was eliminated when manganese-containing superoxide dismutase was added to the cyanide/DMPO solution (Fig. 2 C). This indicated that the DMPO/⋅OH in Fig. 2 B is present as a decomposition product of DMPO/⋅OOH or that hydroxyl radical formation was superoxide-dependent. It should be noted that manganese-containing superoxide dismutase did not eliminate all of the DMPO/⋅OH when the CcO was present in the system (data not shown). In addition, no DMPO/⋅CN was detected when the KCN was excluded from the system (Fig. 2 D). To test the possibility that the detectable cyanyl radical in the CcO/KCN system resulted from contamination with H2O2, CcO was incubated with catalase prior to the addition of KCN and DMPO. The resulting ESR spectrum did not significantly differ from that obtained from the system without catalase (Fig. 2 E). H2O2 contamination can therefore be excluded. It should be noted that an incubation of catalase, KCN, and DMPO did not generate a detectable cyanyl radical (data not shown). Pretreatment of enzyme with azide, up to 500 eq per aa3, did not inhibit the formation of cyanyl radical (Fig. 2 F). To confirm that the cyanyl radical is the carbon-centered radical trapped in the reaction of CcO with cyanide, K13CN (I = 1/2) was used. As shown in Fig. 2 G, the 6-line DMPO/⋅12CN spectrum was completely converted to the 12-line DMPO/⋅13CN spectrum (a N = 15.43, a Hβ = 18.90, and a 13Cβ = 12.95 G), thus confirming the origin of the trapped carbon-centered radical as the cyanyl radical (12Moreno S.N.J.

The instrumental settings are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the possibility that the highly reactive ⋅OH may be generated and could attack CN− thereby producing the cyanyl radical, we added the well known hydroxyl radical scavenger Me2SO (700 mm) to the system containing 0.2 mm CcO, 10 mm KCN, and 100 mm DMPO. No effect on the DMPO/⋅CN concentration was found (data not shown). Me2SO scavenging of hydroxyl radical should also inhibit any DMPO/⋅OH adduct formed by the trapping of hydroxyl radical. The inclusion of Me2SO in the CcO/KCN system only slightly decreased the production of DMPO/⋅OH (less than 10%, data not shown), indicating that greater than 90% of DMPO/⋅OH was formed independently of hydroxyl radical (37Buettner G.R. Mason R.P. Packer L. Glazer A.N. Methods in Enzymology. 186. Academic Press, New York1990: 127-133Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that DMPO/⋅OH was formed by the nucleophilic substitution of CN− from DMPO/⋅CN by OH− (39Davies M.J. Gilbert B.C. Stell J.K. Whitwood A.C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin. Trans. II. 1992; : 333-335Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the experiment was repeated in buffer prepared in H217O. The CcO was precipitated by 30% saturated ammonium sulfate and then dissolved with 50 mmphosphate buffer in H217O, pH 7.4. The ESR spectrum from the reaction system of CcO (H217O)/KCN was identical to that of CcO/KCN (Fig. 2 A), demonstrating that the possible conversion of DMPO/⋅CN to DMPO/⋅OH via a nucleophilic substitution reaction did not occur to a significant extent (data not shown). The formation of the cyanyl radical with CcO was time-dependent. As shown in Fig.3 A, the intensity of DMPO/⋅CN gradually increased with time. Each spectrum shown in Fig. 3 A was simulated using three species, DMPO/⋅CN, DMPO/⋅OH , and DMPO/⋅ScysCcO protein-derived thiyl radical (a N = 14.68, a Hβ = 15.74 G, and line width = 3.12 G) (40Chen Y.R. Gunther M.R. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3308-3314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The formation of DMPO/⋅ScysCcO was prevented by the pretreatment of CcO with N-ethylmaleimide. The protein-derived thiyl radical was presumably formed from the reaction of Cys residues of CcO with highly reactive ⋅CN. At higher concentrations of DMPO (up to 800 mm), the contribution of DMPO/⋅ScysCcO relative to DMPO/⋅CN was diminished, consistent with DMPO trapping the ⋅CN as the primary radical and preventing the formation of ⋅ScysCcO (data not shown). This DMPO/⋅ScysCcO radical adduct was previously detected when H2O2 was added to CcO (40Chen Y.R. Gunther M.R. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3308-3314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and did not contribute to the spectra shown in Figs. 1 A or 2 A obtained from the reaction mixture after a 1-h incubation. The percent radical adduct concentration derived from the simulations was multiplied by the area of the complete spectrum (obtained from double integration) to quantify the radical adduct concentration. The DMPO/⋅CN concentration was plotted versus time as indicated in Fig. 3 B. Because the generation of the cyanyl radical from cyanide by peroxidases such as horseradish peroxidase, lactoperoxidase, chloroperoxidase (12Moreno S.N.J. Stolze K. Janzen E.G. Mason R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 13Stolze K. Moreno S.N.J. Mason R.P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1989; 37: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and lignin peroxidase H2 (14Shah M.M. Grover T.A. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was H2O2-dependent, it was important to understand how the as-isolated CcO could independently catalyze the same reaction without H2O2. As reported previously by Fabian and Palmer (7Fabian M. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1534-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 41Fabian M. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13802-13810Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), as-isolated CcO contains a small and variable amount of the peroxy form of the enzyme (compound P). To address this issue, the CcO from our preparation was converted to a mixture of its peroxy and ferryloxo forms by the addition of 30 eq of H2O2 at pH 8.0 and examined by the differential spectrum using the as-isolated CcO as a reference. We consistently estimated the amount of compound P/compound F mixture to be 85–95% of theoretical (up to five batches of preparation), which is in line with the observation of Fabian and Palmer (7Fabian M. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1534-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 41Fabian M. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13802-13810Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To bleach the peroxy form present in the as-isolated CcO and convert it to the fully oxidized form, the enzyme was dialyzed against 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, overnight. Sodium cholate (1%) was included in the dialysis buffer to prevent the aggregation of protein. The addition of sodium cholate had no effect on the formation of radical by CcO (data not shown). A significant decrease of DMPO/⋅CN (75–95% decrease, based on the four batches of preparation) was observed when this CcO preparation was incubated with cyanide in the presence of DMPO (data not shown). The addition of H2O2 to dialyzed CcO restored the ESR spectrum of DMPO/⋅CN (data not shown). The cyanyl radical can also be formed from the oxidation of cyanide by horseradish peroxidase in the presence of H2O2 (12Moreno S.N.J. Stolze K. Janzen E.G. Mason R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 13Stolze K. Moreno S.N.J. Mason R.P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1989; 37: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Similar results were also observed in the system of CcO/H2O2/KCN (Fig. 4 A). The DMPO/⋅CN was readily detectable when the H2O2 was included in the system of as-isolated CcO/KCN/DMPO (Fig.4 A). The elimination of H2O2 from the system yielded a spectrum (Fig. 4 B) that is similar to the spectrum recorded at 3 min in Fig. 3 A and depends totally on CcO (Fig. 4 C). Only the 4-line spectrum of DMPO/⋅OH (Fig. 4 D) was observed when the CcO was omitted from the system. The replacement of K12CN with K13CN converted the 6-line spectrum to a 12-line spectrum (Fig. 4 E), thus confirming that the carbon-centered cyanyl radical was produced in the system of CcO/KCN/H2O2 (12Moreno S.N.J. Stolze K. Janzen E.G. Mason R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The azidyl radical was detected during an investigation of the inhibitory effect of azide on catalase (34Kalyanaraman B. Janzen E.G. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4003-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to catalase/H2O2, the one-electron oxidation of azide to the azidyl radical can be catalyzed by various peroxidase/H2O2 systems (34Kalyanaraman B. Janzen E.G. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4003-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, azidyl radical was detected in the succinate-driven respiration of azide-inhibited submitochondrial particles (42Partridge R.S. Monroe S.M. Parks J.K. Johnson K. Parker Jr., W.D. Eaton G.R. Eaton S.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It was not clear whether the azidyl radical detected in the system of NaN3/submitochondrial particles arose from hydroxyl radical or from membrane-bound components with peroxidase activity. However, the inclusion of the CcO in the mixture of NaN3, H2O2, and DMPO resulted in an ESR spectrum consisting of a quartet of triplets (aNON = 14.8, a Hβ = 14.2, and a 14Nβ = 3.1 G) assigned to DMPO/⋅N3 (Fig.5 A). DMPO/⋅N3 formation was dependent on H2O2 (Fig. 5 B), apparently because of the inability of the as-isolated CcO to oxidize NaN3. Removal of the enzyme from the system resulted in failure to produce the azide radical (Fig. 5 C). The computer simulation of the spectrum in Fig. 5 A indicated a mixture of azidyl radical and hydroxyl radical adducts. The features of the DMPO/⋅OH radical adduct are not resolved in Fig. 5 A because of coincidental overlap with the DMPO/⋅N3 radical adduct signal. To simulate the spectrum more accurately,15N3-azide (I = 1/2) was used, which allowed the features of DMPO/⋅OH to be clearly visible in the composite spectrum (Fig. 5 D) (34Kalyanaraman B. Janzen E.G. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4003-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Simulation of the spectrum shown in Fig. 5 D indicated a mixture of azidyl radical and hydroxyl radical adducts in an 84:16 ratio. The expected spectrum with a quartet of doublets (aNON= 14.8, a Hβ = 14.2, and a 15Nβ = 4.3 G) obtained from15N3-labeled sodium azide was found. The hyperfine coupling constants were essentially the same as those published (34Kalyanaraman B. Janzen E.G. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4003-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It had been pointed out by Yamazaki and Piette (43Yamazaki I. Piette L.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 77: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) as early as 1963 that the oxidation of cyanide by compound I of hemoproteins should be considered when cyanide is used as an inhibitor and irregular effects are found. The results presented in our study clearly demonstrate that the reaction of CcO with cyanide leads to a detectable cyanyl radical. Therefore, in addition to forming a cyanide complex, CcO also catalyzes the one-electron oxidation of cyanide to cyanyl radical. As previously mentioned, peroxidases such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP) can catalyze a similar reaction only in the presence of H2O2 (12Moreno S.N.J. Stolze K. Janzen E.G. Mason R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 13Stolze K. Moreno S.N.J. Mason R.P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1989; 37: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34Kalyanaraman B. Janzen E.G. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4003-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and both compound I and compound II were proposed to account for the production of cyanyl radical in the KCN/HRP/H2O2 system.HRP+H2O2→HRP­compound I+H2OREACTION1HRP­compound I+CN−→HRP­compound II+⋅CNREACTION2HRP­compound II+CN−→HRP+⋅CNREACTION3Both peroxidase compound I- and II-like analogs have been suggested to participate in the catalytic mechanism of CcO (43Yamazaki I. Piette L.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 77: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 44Ferguson-Miller S. Babcock G.T. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2889-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). It is generally thought that the catalytic cycle is initiated with the fully oxidized CcO. Cytochrome c provides two electrons to the CuB/heme a3 binuclear center via CuA and heme a; the enzyme is converted to its two-electron reduced form, so-called “species R,” which has a high affinity for dioxygen. The reaction of dioxygen with species R results in a transient formation of compound P (peroxy, “607 nm” form). Because H2O2 carries two reducing equivalents, its addition to the fully oxidized CcO also forms the compound P species (8Castric P.A. Vennesland B. Conn E.E. Knowles C.J. Westley J. Wissing I. Cyanide in Biology. Academic Press, New York1981: 233-261Google Scholar, 44Ferguson-Miller S. Babcock G.T. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2889-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 45Kitagawa T.

Kitagawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29385-29388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of a third electron to compound P leads to the formation of compound F (ferryloxo, “580 nm” form). The ferric form of CcO is then regenerated from compound F by the addition of a fourth electron accompanied by the release of H2O. The structure of compound P is not clear and is still under debate (44Ferguson-Miller S. Babcock G.T. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2889-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 45Kitagawa T. Ogura T. Karlin K.D. Progress in Inorganic Chemistry. 45. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1997: 431-479Google Scholar, 46Gennis R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 241-248Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In a recent report, the reaction of the two-electron reduced form of CcO with dioxygen was studied using time-resolved resonance Raman techniques. Those data indicate the involvement of a heme a3 ferryloxo species in the structure of compound P (47Proshlyakov D.A. Pressler M.A. Babcock G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8020-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Compound F, as supported by substantial evidence (48Varotsis C. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 29: 7357-7362Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 49Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikstrom M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), is structurally related to compound II. It is proposed that compounds P and F would be the equivalents of compounds I and II of peroxidases if the oxygen chemistry of CcO were similar to that of a peroxidase (44Ferguson-Miller S. Babcock G.T. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2889-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 45Kitagawa T. Ogura T. Karlin K.D. Progress in Inorganic Chemistry. 45.

The results conveyed here support this hypothesis. The ferric form of CcO (Fea 33+ − CuB2+) presumably cannot catalyze the one-electron oxidation of cyanide to the cyanyl radical without additional oxidizing equivalents from H2O2. Hence, the addition of H2O2 yields compounds P and/or F that are capable of catalyzing the production of cyanyl radical from cyanide (Fig. 4 A). Based on the observations of this investigation and the discussion above, the mechanism by which the cyanyl radical was produced from the reaction of cyanide with CcO is proposed in the following reactions.Compound P+CN−→Compound F(Fea3IV=O)+⋅CNREACTION4Compound F(Fea3IV=O)+CN−→CcO(resting state,Fea33+−CuB2+)+⋅CNREACTION5Several possible structures including the Fea 3IV = O porphyrin π cation radical (Por⋅+Fea 3IV = O) were suggested for compound P depending on how the O–O bond of molecular oxygen is cleaved (45Kitagawa T. Ogura T. Karlin K.D. Progress in Inorganic Chemistry. 45. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1997: 431-479Google Scholar). We believe that compound P would be able to convert cyanide to cyanyl radical if the Fea 3IV = O porphyrin π cation radical or its functional equivalent were formed. Our results also help explain the previous observation of Fabian and Palmer (7Fabian M. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1534-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in which the loss of the 607 nm band (compound P) and an increase in the 580 nm band (compound F) is detected in the reaction of cyanide with compound P. We propose the reaction of fully oxidized CcO (Fea 33+ − CuB2+) with CN− in the presence of H2O2 (Fig. 4 A) to involve the following reactions.CcO(Fea33+−CuB2+)+H2O2→Compound P(compound I­like)+H2OREACTION6Compound P+CN−→Compound F(Fea3IV=O)+⋅CNREACTION7Compound F(Fea3IV=O)+CN−→CcO(Fea33+−CuB2+)+⋅CNREACTION8The reaction converting cyanide to cyanyl radical in this system is much faster than that of the as-isolated CcO/cyanide system, presumably because the reactive enzyme intermediates are not limiting. A peroxidase compound I-like species containing Fea 3IV = O porphyrin π cation radical at heme a3 was preferably suggested to be involved in the reaction of fully oxidized CcO with H2O2 (45Kitagawa T. Ogura T. Karlin K.D. Progress in Inorganic Chemistry. 45. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1997: 431-479Google Scholar, 53Proshlyakov D.A. Ogura T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Appelman E.H.

This evidence supports the possibility of a ferryloxo state of compound P as suggested in studies led by Proshlyakov (47Proshlyakov D.A. Pressler M.A. Babcock G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8020-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 51Proshlyakov D.A. Ogura T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Kitagawa T.

It is worth noting that a protein-centered radical (protein radical + Fea 3IV = O) (50Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikstrom M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12235-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was detected in the reaction system of CcO/H2O2 using either DMPO or nitroso spin traps (40Chen Y.R. Gunther M.R. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3308-3314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We do not rule out the possibility that a protein-centered radical can generate the cyanyl radical. Cyanide has been used to chemically stimulate ischemia (15Ohata H. Trollinger D.R. Lemasters J.J. Res. Commun. Mol. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1994; 86: 259-271PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rajdev S. Reynolds I.J. Neuroscience. 1994; 62: 667-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Sakaida I. Nagatomi A. Okita K. J. Gastroenterol. 1996; 31: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 18Ferreira I.L. Duarte C.B. Carvalho A.P. Brain Res. 1997; 768: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19Nishimura Y. Romer L.H. Lemasters J.J. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The blockade of oxidative phosphorylation, changes of membrane potential, and lipid peroxidation were generally proposed to account for the effects of cyanide-induced ischemia. Reactive oxygen species were detected in this system, leading to oxidative stress. The results reported here imply that the generation of the cyanyl radical may serve as an important factor in triggering these effects. Because the chemistry of the cyanyl radical is extremely oxidative, it may be reactive enough to initiate lipid peroxidation via the abstracting of H⋅ from lipid. Cyanide-stimulated generation of oxidative stress has recently been reported in the study of cerebellar granule cells (20Gunasekar P.G. Sun P.W. Kanthasamy A.G. Borowitz J.L. Isom G.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 150-155PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gunasekar P.G. Borowitz J.L. Isom G.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 236-241PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the reactivity with cyanide, as-isolated CcO had little ability to oxidize azide to a detectable azidyl radical (Fig. 5 B). CcO exhibited the same behavior as catalase and various peroxidases (34Kalyanaraman B. Janzen E.G. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4003-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in that it did not produce a detectable azidyl radical in the absence of added H2O2 (Fig. 5 A). Currently, there is no evidence to indicate that the relative substrate affinity of cyanide to compound P or HRP-compound I is higher than that of azide. However, two groups (54Li W. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1833-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 55Yoshikawa S. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9757-9766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) employed infrared spectroscopy to investigate the interaction of azide with the heme a3-CuB center of CcO. The infrared spectrum characteristic of azide-bound CcO can be eliminated by cyanide and replaced with that of the cyanide-bound CcO, thus leading to the conclusion that cyanide has a higher relative affinity of the ligand for CcO than azide and readily displaces azide. The result of this investigation indicated that the enzymatic conversion of cyanide to cyanyl radical by CcO was not affected by azide (Fig. 2 F), regardless of whether the enzyme was treated with azide before or after the addition of cyanide. Furthermore, the dissociation constant for azide from CcO was reported to be 65–250 μm (2Wilson D.F. Erecinska M. Fleischer S. Leaster P. Methods in Enzymology. 53. Academic Press, New York1978: 191-197Google Scholar, 4Wilson D.F. Erecinska M. Brocklehurst E.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 151: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 54Li W. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1833-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the dissociation constant for cyanide under similar conditions was reported to be 1–4 μm (2Wilson D.F. Erecinska M. Fleischer S. Leaster P. Methods in Enzymology. 53. Academic Press, New York1978: 191-197Google Scholar, 4Wilson D.F. Erecinska M. Brocklehurst E.S. Arch. Biochem.

Nicholls P. Van Gelder B.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 256: 258-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Hence, the lower affinity of CcO for azide might contribute, in part, to its humble ability to oxidize azide. Azidyl radical was also detected in the system of azide-inhibited submitochondrial particles (42Partridge R.S. Monroe S.M. Parks J.K. Johnson K. Parker Jr., W.D. Eaton G.R. Eaton S.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the azide inhibition of CcO in the succinate-driven respiration prompted the accumulation of superoxide, leading to H2O2formation that, together with an endogenous peroxidase, oxidizes azide to the azidyl radical. Our results indicate that CcO might be the proposed endogenous peroxidase in submitochondrial particles. In conclusion, the highly reactive cyanyl and azidyl radicals should be considered in the interpretation of data when either inhibitor is used with CcO, mitochondria, or cells."
https://openalex.org/W2078897874,"Abstract The location of the interaction of the COOH terminus of the bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase with its trimeric, circular sliding clamp has been established. A peptide corresponding to the COOH terminus of the DNA polymerase was labeled with a fluorophore and fluorescence spectroscopy used to show that it forms a specific complex with the sliding clamp by virtue of its lowK D value (7.1 ± 1.0 μm). The same peptide was labeled with a photoaffinity probe and cross-linked to the sliding clamp. Mass spectrometry of tryptic digests determined the sole linkage point to be Ala-159 on the sliding clamp, an amino acid that lies on the subunit interface. These results demonstrate that the COOH terminus of the DNA polymerase is inserted into the subunit interface of its sliding clamp, thereby conferring processivity to the DNA polymerase."

We show that both GRF1 and GRFβ are expressed selectively in beta cell lines, pancreatic islet cells and brain. Treatment of beta cell lines (βTC1 and HIT) with calcium ionophore led to a significant elevation in activity of the Ras signal transduction pathway, as determined by phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK). Transfection of beta cells with a plasmid encoding a dominant negative variant of GRF1 led to 70% reduction in ERK phosphorylation, consistent with a role for GRF1 in calcium-dependent Ras signaling in these cells. To examine the possible function of GRFβ, cultured cells were transfected with a GRFβ expression vector. This led to a significant reduction in both GRF1-dependent ERK phosphorylation and AP1-dependent reporter gene activity.

The beta cell functions as a glucose sensor through specialized enzymatic machinery, including a high Km glucose transporter (Glut2) and a high Km glucokinase (reviewed in Refs.1Matschinsky F.M.

Elevated blood glucose levels lead to increased intracellular ATP/ADP ratios, causing closure of ATP-dependent potassium channels, membrane depolarization, and a resultant increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels. This, in turn, is believed to cause increased insulin biosynthesis and secretion through mechanisms that are poorly defined. Elevated glucose concentrations can activate MAP1 kinase pathways in cultured beta cells (3Frodin M. Sekine N. Roche E. Filloux C. Prentki M. Wollheim C.B. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol.

The precise actions of Ca2+ and the functional significance of elevated MAP kinase activity in beta cells remain to be established. In order to better understand the molecular basis for cell-specific functions of beta cells, we have used representational difference analysis (9Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M.

Walker M.D. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); using one of these, we have now isolated a clone encoding the novel protein GRFβ, which shares an identical region with GRF1, a calcium-dependent guanine exchange factor originally identified in brain cells (13Shou C.

In this report, we document the sequence of GRFβ, and demonstrate that both GRFβ and GRF1 are expressed preferentially in beta cells and brain. In addition we show that GRF1 plays a role in calcium signaling in beta cells and that GRFβ represents a naturally occurring, dominant negative form of GRF1. A βTC1 cDNA library constructed in the vector λGT11 (15Walker M.D. Park C.W. Rosen A. Aronheim A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was screened using a labeled DNA probe of clone 41 (12Arava Y. Adamsky K. Ezerzer C. Ablamunits V.

For reporter assay, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid containing nine copies of the AP1 binding sequence derived from the SV40 enhancer (4 μg), GRFβ expression vector (5 μg), and RSV-luciferase internal control plasmid (2 μg) were transfected using the calcium phosphate procedure (18Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Glycerol shock (10%) was performed after 5 h. Cells were harvested 40 h later and extracts prepared for assay of luciferase (Promega luciferase reagent) and CAT activity. For phosphorylation analysis, HA-tagged ERK1 expression plasmid (4 μg) was transfected into HIT cells together with 12 μg of GRF1ΔC, encoding a dominant negative GRF1, prepared from a GRF1 expression vector by Eco RI digestion to remove the catalytic domain (19Zippel R. Orecchia S. Sturani E. Martegani E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections into 293T cells were performed in six-well plates with 0.25 μg of HA-ERK plasmid, 0.25 μg of GRF1 expression vector, where indicated, and 3.5 μg of GRFβ expression vector or pcDNA3 parental vector alone. RNA was prepared using the TRI reagent kit (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) followed by DNase I treatment for 20 min at 37 °C. Mouse islets were prepared by collagenase digestion followed by Histopaque density gradient centrifugation (20Gotoh M. Maki T. Kiyoizumi T. Satomi S. Monaco A.P. Transplantation. 1985; 40: 437-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Islet RNA was prepared by the guanidinium thiocyanate procedure (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene/Wiley-Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed using the Access RT-PCR System (Promega) with 0.5 μg of total RNA. The primers used to detect GRFβ were TCTAGCATCATGCAGAAAGCC (top strand primer corresponding to nt 130–150 of GRFβ) and GGGAGGAGAACCATAGATGG (bottom strand primer corresponding to nt 680–699). The predicted amplified fragment is 570 bp. The primers used to detect GRF1 were TCTAGCATCATGCAGAAAGCC (top strand primer, same as used for GRFβ, corresponding to nt 216–236 of mouse GRF1) and GCGCAGGAAGTTGTTGACAAGG (bottom strand primer corresponding to nt 1014–1035). The predicted amplified fragment is 820 bp. The hybridization probe used for GRFβ was a restriction fragment corresponding to the GRFβ-specific region (nt 502–599). The hybridization probe used for GRF1 was a restriction fragment corresponding to nt 216–478. One-fifth of the reaction was analyzed by Southern blot as described previously (12Arava Y. Adamsky K. Ezerzer C. Ablamunits V. Walker M.D. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). DNase I-treated RNA samples (20 μg) were mixed with a 32P-labeled antisense probe produced by in vitro transcription reaction using T3 RNA polymerase. Samples were processed as described (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene/Wiley-Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar) except that RNase digestion was performed using 6 units of RNase ONE (Promega) in a total volume of 300 μl. Cells extracts (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene/Wiley-Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar) were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblot analysis using the following antibodies: rabbit anti-ERK (1:30,000), mouse antiphosphorylated ERK (1:30,000), and mouse anti-HA epitope (1:500). Quantitation was performed on autoradiograms in which signals were within the linear response range using a Bio-Rad model GS-690 densitometer and Multi-Analyst software. Relative ERK phosphorylation for each sample was determined from the ratio of absorbance using anti-P ERK to that obtained using anti-HA or anti-ERK. Statistical significance was evaluated using two-tailed Student's t test. Using clone 41, one of the products of the representational difference analysis (12Arava Y. Adamsky K. Ezerzer C. Ablamunits V. Walker M.D. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we screened a βTC1 cDNA library and obtained a 859-bp cDNA with a complete open reading frame of 178 amino acids (Fig.1 A). A second cDNA clone isolated in the screen was identical in sequence except that it was truncated at the 5′-end. Data base comparisons using the 859-bp cDNA showed that its 5′ portion is identical at the DNA level to the Ras guanine exchange factor, GRF1 (CDC25Mm1) (Fig.1 B) (13Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 14Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 22Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Zippel R. Lowy D.R. Zhang K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4007-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We term the encoded 178-amino acid protein GRFβ. Its N-terminal 92 amino acids are identical to the N terminus of mouse GRF1 (Fig. 1 B), whereas the C-terminal 86 amino acids show no significant resemblance to known proteins. Thus GRFβ lacks all the characteristic motifs of GRF1, except for the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (Fig. 1 B), half of which is identical to the corresponding portion of GRF1 and half of which derives from the novel C-terminal portion. The complete identity between 5′ regions of GRFβ and GRF1 at the DNA level suggests that these represent alternate splice products of a single gene. Consistent with this is the fact that both GRF1 and GRFβ sequences match perfectly the sequence of a mouse genomic clone U55232 up to a position where all three sequences diverge completely (Fig. 1 C). The sequence of the genomic clone at this location matches exactly the splice donor consensus sequence (23Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2783) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). To characterize GRF1 and GRFβ transcripts, we performed RNase protection assay, using a 462-nt antisense probe derived from the GRFβ DNA sequence, which contained a 287-nt identity with GRF1 (Fig.2 A). A distinct band, corresponding in size to the expected 432-nt GRFβ protected fragment was obtained using βTC1 RNA, but not with αTC1 RNA (Fig.2 A). A faster migrating band corresponding to the expected 287-nt GRF1 protected fragment was also obtained with βTC1 but not with αTC1 RNA (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2A, RNase protection assay. Antisense probe was mixed with 20 μg of total RNA from βTC1 and αTC1. Following RNase digestion, the products were resolved on sequencing gel and exposed to x-ray film. The scheme indicates the expected sizes of the intact antisense probe (462 nt) and the predicted protected bands corresponding to GRFβ RNA (432 nt) and GRF1 (287 nt). The arrows indicate the migration of labeled DNA size markers.B, RT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from the following mouse tissues: brain (B), pancreas (P), lung (L), testis (T), spleen (S), kidney (K), liver (Li), heart (H), muscle (M), βTC1 (β), αTC1 (α), and islets (Is). 0.5 μg total RNA (left panel) or 5 ng (right panel) was subjected to RT-PCR followed by hybridization with the indicated probes. The lower panel shows the ethidium bromide staining of PCR reactions performed with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) primers, as a control for the efficiency of the RT-PCR reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the tissue distribution of GRFβ, we performed RT-PCR analysis with RNA from different tissues using primers specific for each splice variant (Fig. 2 B). Using the GRFβ primers two bands were observed. By isolating and sequencing these bands separately we showed that the upper band represents GRFβ and the lower band a truncated version lacking nucleotides 355–507. The highest levels of GRFβ mRNA were seen in βTC1 cells and in the brain, while GRF1 was expressed at highest levels in the brain and to a lesser extent in βTC1 cells. Both transcripts appeared in substantial amounts in mouse islets, at similar levels as in βTC1. Taken together, the RNase protection and the RT-PCR analyses indicate relatively high levels of GRFβ and GRF1 in the brain and beta cells. However, while GRF1 was expressed at higher levels in the brain than in beta cells, GRFβ showed the opposite pattern: higher expression in beta cells than in the brain. To examine the possible role of GRF1 in beta cells, we treated HIT cells with calcium ionophores. We observed strong activation of the Ras pathway, as measured by the levels of activated ERK1/2, almost to the level of the activation obtained by 10% FCS (Fig. 3 A). Activation was also observed following incubation with ionophore A23187 (Fig.3 B), KCl (50 mm for 10 min), and glucose (15 mm for 10 min) (data not shown). Furthermore, ionomycin led to activation of ERK also in βTC1 cells (Fig. 3 B), but not in the cell line 293T, which lacks endogenous GRF1 (14Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 B). To determine the role of GRF1 in the calcium-dependent activation, we constructed a plasmid encoding a truncated GRF1 protein, GRF1ΔC, lacking its catalytic domain, which is expected to display dominant negative activity (19Zippel R. Orecchia S. Sturani E. Martegani E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar). When HIT cells were transfected with GRF1ΔC, ionomycin-dependent phosphorylation of co-transfected epitope-tagged HA-ERK was reduced by approximately 70% (Fig. 4, A and B). We tested whether GRFβ (which contains the N-terminal 92 amino acids of GRF1) can affect the Ras/MAPK pathway. In 293T cells co-transfected with GRF1 and GRFβ, the extent of ionomycin-dependent ERK activation was significantly lower than in cells transfected with GRF1 alone (Fig. 5 A). Co-transfection of serum-treated NIH3T3 cells with an AP1 reporter plasmid and an expression vector encoding the intact GRFβ protein produced a 2-fold lower CAT activity compared with co-transfection with control vector, almost to the inhibition level obtained with the dominant negative Ras variant N17 (Fig. 5 B) (24Quilliam L.A. Kato K. Rabun K.M. Hisaka M.M. Huff S.Y. Campbell-Burk S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus GRFβ behaves as an inhibitor of both GRF1-mediated Ras/ERK signal transduction and of serum-dependent MAPK signaling pathways leading to AP1 activation. Proteins of the Ras family play a crucial role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenesis (25Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Their activity depends on the presence of guanine exchange factors (GEFs), which are essential to promote dissociation of GDP-bound Ras to facilitate binding of GTP. The Sos-related GEF proteins are distributed broadly in many cell types and typically activate Ras following activation of growth factor receptor and a membrane recruitment mechanism mediated by the adapter protein Grb2 (26Qian X. Vass W.C. Papageorge A.G. Anborgh P.H. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The GRF-related GEFs, on the other hand, are less widely distributed; GRF1 is present in neuronal cells (14Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and additional tissues and tumor cells (27Guerrero C. Rojas J.M. Chedid M. Esteban L.M. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Font de Mora J. Santos E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1097-1107PubMed Google Scholar); it activates Ras in a calcium-dependent fashion (14Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 28Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.B. Goonesekera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Calcium-dependent activation is mediated through calmodulin binding to an N-terminal IQ domain; however the precise mechanism leading to calcium-dependent activation remains to be determined and involves also pleckstrin and coiled-coil domains of the protein (28Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.B. Goonesekera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A number of naturally occurring splice variants have been identified previously (29Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. Zhang K.E. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7718-7724Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); these apparently represent N-terminal truncations rather than C-terminal truncations. The physiological significance of these truncations has not been addressed. In this study, we have demonstrated for the first time that GRF1 is expressed in pancreatic beta cells. The inhibitory effect of a truncated dominant negative form of GRF1 suggests that GRF1 is essential for activation of calcium-dependent MAP kinase activity in the beta cell. We have further identified GRFβ, a novel 178-amino acid protein comprising the N-terminal 92 amino acids of GRF1, including a portion of the PH1 domain of GRF1 and 86 unrelated amino acids. GRFβ RNA was detected in beta cells and brain. We provide evidence that GRFβ represents a naturally occurring dominant negative form of GRF1, which may play a role in regulating the normal function of GRF1. The mechanism whereby GRFβ inhibits signaling is not clear. On the one hand, the N terminus of GRF1 has been shown in in vitro studies to inhibit the catalytic activity of GRF1 (30Baouz S. Jacquet E. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6671-6676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), perhaps through intra-molecular rearrangement. On the other hand, in vivo studies clearly show that deletion of the N-terminal PH1 domain leads to both intracellular redistribution of the protein and loss of calcium responsiveness (28Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.B. Goonesekera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Probably the PH1 domain has multiple functions, including a role in proper intracellular localization. The physiological role of GRF1 is not yet established. Mice lacking the GRF1 gene display impaired memory consolidation and slow growth (31Brambilla R. Gnesutta N. Minichiello L. White G. Roylance A.J. Herron C.E. Ramsey M. Wolfer D.P. Cestari V.

Schweighoffer F. Tocque B. Bluet P.M. Cormier V. Dautry F. Nature. 1998; 393: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The presence of GRF1 in beta cells and the ability of a dominant negative form to inhibit calcium-dependent MAPK activity suggest a key role for GRF1 in beta cell calcium signaling. GRFβ may function in vivo to modulate GRF1-dependent Ras activation. It remains to be established how GRF1 and GRFβ are regulated to activate MAPK activity and how MAPK activity influences beta cell function. We thank C. Ezerzer, V. Ablamunits, and S.
