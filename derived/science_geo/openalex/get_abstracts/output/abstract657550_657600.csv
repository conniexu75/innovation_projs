The development of a vaccine is urgently needed for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Here, we report the pilot-scale production of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (BBIBP-CorV) that induces high levels of neutralizing antibodies titers in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and nonhuman primates (cynomolgus monkeys and rhesus macaques) to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2. Two-dose immunizations using 2 μg/dose of BBIBP-CorV provided highly efficient protection against SARS-CoV-2 intratracheal challenge in rhesus macaques, without detectable antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. In addition, BBIBP-CorV exhibits efficient productivity and good genetic stability for vaccine manufacture. These results support the further evaluation of BBIBP-CorV in a clinical trial."

However, the metabolic processes that modulate the response to lipid peroxidation are poorly defined. Using genetic screens, we compared metabolic genes essential for proliferation upon inhibition of cystine uptake or glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4). Interestingly, very few genes were commonly required under both conditions, suggesting that cystine limitation and GPX4 inhibition may impair proliferation via distinct mechanisms. Our screens also identify tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) biosynthesis as an essential metabolic pathway upon GPX4 inhibition. Mechanistically, BH4 is a potent radical-trapping antioxidant that protects lipid membranes from autoxidation, alone and in synergy with vitamin E. Dihydrofolate reductase catalyzes the regeneration of BH4, and its inhibition by methotrexate synergizes with GPX4 inhibition. Altogether, our work identifies the mechanism by which BH4 acts as an endogenous antioxidant and provides a compendium of metabolic modifiers of lipid peroxidation."

https://openalex.org/W3047648154,"Public health newborn screening (NBS) programs provide population-scale ascertainment of rare, treatable conditions that require urgent intervention. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is currently used to screen newborns for a panel of rare inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs)1-4. The NBSeq project evaluated whole-exome sequencing (WES) as an innovative methodology for NBS. We obtained archived residual dried blood spots and data for nearly all IEM cases from the 4.5 million infants born in California between mid-2005 and 2013 and from some infants who screened positive by MS/MS, but were unaffected upon follow-up testing. WES had an overall sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 98.4%, compared to 99.0% and 99.8%, respectively for MS/MS, although effectiveness varied among individual IEMs. Thus, WES alone was insufficiently sensitive or specific to be a primary screen for most NBS IEMs. However, as a secondary test for infants with abnormal MS/MS screens, WES could reduce false-positive results, facilitate timely case resolution and in some instances even suggest more appropriate or specific diagnosis than that initially obtained. This study represents the largest, to date, sequencing effort of an entire population of IEM-affected cases, allowing unbiased assessment of current capabilities of WES as a tool for population screening."

However, in this largely MHC-class-I-negative tumor, the mechanism of action of anti-PD-1 therapy remains undefined. We utilized the complementary approaches of T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and cytometry by time-of-flight analysis to obtain a peripheral immune signature of responsiveness to PD-1 blockade in 56 patients treated in the CheckMate 205 phase II clinical trial (NCT02181738). Anti-PD-1 therapy was most effective in patients with a diverse baseline TCR repertoire and an associated expansion of singleton clones during treatment. CD4+, but not CD8+, TCR diversity significantly increased during therapy, most strikingly in patients who had achieved complete responses. Additionally, patients who responded to therapy had an increased abundance of activated natural killer cells and a newly identified CD3-CD68+CD4+GrB+ subset. These studies highlight the roles of recently expanded, clonally diverse CD4+ T cells and innate effectors in the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in cHL."
https://openalex.org/W3047822086,"The RAF family kinases function in the RAS–ERK pathway to transmit signals from activated RAS to the downstream kinases MEK and ERK. This pathway regulates cell proliferation, differentiation and survival, enabling mutations in RAS and RAF to act as potent drivers of human cancers. Drugs targeting the prevalent oncogenic mutant BRAF(V600E) have shown great efficacy in the clinic, but long-term effectiveness is limited by resistance mechanisms that often exploit the dimerization-dependent process by which RAF kinases are activated. Here, we investigated a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) approach to BRAF inhibition. The most effective PROTAC, termed P4B, displayed superior specificity and inhibitory properties relative to non-PROTAC controls in BRAF(V600E) cell lines. In addition, P4B displayed utility in cell lines harboring alternative BRAF mutations that impart resistance to conventional BRAF inhibitors. This work provides a proof of concept for a substitute to conventional chemical inhibition to therapeutically constrain oncogenic BRAF. A PROTAC termed P4B targeting BRAF V600E mutant has been developed, which displays enhanced inhibitory function in cell lines carrying BRAF mutations that impart resistance to conventional BRAF inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3047911290,"Sensory cortices display a suite of ubiquitous dynamical features, such as ongoing noise variability, transient overshoots and oscillations, that have so far escaped a common, principled theoretical account. We developed a unifying model for these phenomena by training a recurrent excitatory–inhibitory neural circuit model of a visual cortical hypercolumn to perform sampling-based probabilistic inference. The optimized network displayed several key biological properties, including divisive normalization and stimulus-modulated noise variability, inhibition-dominated transients at stimulus onset and strong gamma oscillations. These dynamical features had distinct functional roles in speeding up inferences and made predictions that we confirmed in novel analyses of recordings from awake monkeys. Our results suggest that the basic motifs of cortical dynamics emerge as a consequence of the efficient implementation of the same computational function—fast sampling-based inference—and predict further properties of these motifs that can be tested in future experiments. Neural oscillations, transients and variability are widely observed in sensory cortices. All these features emerge in neural networks optimized for the singular task of representing perceptual uncertainty in the variability of neural responses."
https://openalex.org/W3048203223,"Cerebrovascular abnormalities have emerged as a preclinical manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia, diseases characterized by the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau. However, it is unclear whether tau contributes to these neurovascular alterations independent of neurodegeneration. We report that mice expressing mutated tau exhibit a selective suppression of neural activity-induced cerebral blood flow increases that precedes tau pathology and cognitive impairment. This dysfunction is attributable to a reduced vasodilatation of intracerebral arterioles and is reversible by reducing tau production. Mechanistically, the failure of neurovascular coupling involves a tau-induced dissociation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95) and a reduced production of the potent vasodilator nitric oxide during glutamatergic synaptic activity. These data identify glutamatergic signaling dysfunction and nitric oxide deficiency as yet-undescribed early manifestations of tau pathobiology, independent of neurodegeneration, and provide a mechanism for the neurovascular alterations observed in the preclinical stages of tauopathies. Park et al. demonstrate in tauopathy models that tau disrupts the interaction between neuronal nitric oxide synthase and PSD95, uncoupling glutamatergic synaptic activity from nitric oxide production and dampening the hemodynamic response to activation."
https://openalex.org/W3047675349,"The nervous system is hypothesized to compute reward prediction errors (RPEs) to promote adaptive behavior. Correlates of RPEs have been observed in the midbrain dopamine system, but the extent to which RPE signals exist in other reward-processing regions is less well understood. In the present study, we quantified outcome history-based RPE signals in the ventral pallidum (VP), a basal ganglia region functionally linked to reward-seeking behavior. We trained rats to respond to reward-predicting cues, and we fit computational models to predict the firing rates of individual neurons at the time of reward delivery. We found that a subset of VP neurons encoded RPEs and did so more robustly than the nucleus accumbens, an input to the VP. VP RPEs predicted changes in task engagement, and optogenetic manipulation of the VP during reward delivery bidirectionally altered rats’ subsequent reward-seeking behavior. Our data suggest a pivotal role for the VP in computing teaching signals that influence adaptive reward seeking. The nervous system is hypothesized to calculate reward prediction errors to estimate reward availability in the environment. The authors quantify a robust prediction error signal in the ventral pallidum derived from recently received rewarding outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W3048007410,"Spectrally separated fluorophores allow the observation of multiple targets simultaneously inside living cells, leading to a deeper understanding of the molecular interplay that regulates cell function and fate. Chemogenetic systems combining a tag and a synthetic fluorophore provide certain advantages over fluorescent proteins since there is no requirement for chromophore maturation. Here, we present the engineering of a set of spectrally orthogonal fluorogen-activating tags based on the fluorescence-activating and absorption shifting tag (FAST) that are compatible with two-color, live-cell imaging. The resulting tags, greenFAST and redFAST, demonstrate orthogonality not only in their fluorogen recognition capabilities, but also in their one- and two-photon absorption profiles. This pair of orthogonal tags allowed the creation of a two-color cell cycle sensor capable of detecting very short, early cell cycles in zebrafish development and the development of split complementation systems capable of detecting multiple protein-protein interactions by live-cell fluorescence microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W3048317245,"The adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) latrophilin 3 (ADGRL3) has been associated with increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance use in human genetic studies. Knockdown in multiple species leads to hyperlocomotion and altered dopamine signaling. Thus, ADGRL3 is a potential target for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders that involve dopamine dysfunction, but its basic signaling properties are poorly understood. Identification of adhesion GPCR signaling partners has been limited by a lack of tools to acutely activate these receptors in living cells. Here, we design a novel acute activation strategy to characterize ADGRL3 signaling by engineering a receptor construct in which we could trigger acute activation enzymatically. Using this assay, we found that ADGRL3 signals through G12/G13 and Gq, with G12/13 the most robustly activated. Gα12/13 is a new player in ADGRL3 biology, opening up unexplored roles for ADGRL3 in the brain. Our methodological advancements should be broadly useful in adhesion GPCR research."
https://openalex.org/W3048474896,"Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) mediated transcytosis is an attractive strategy to enhance brain uptake of protein drugs, but translation remains a challenge. Here, a single domain shark antibody VNAR fragment (TXB2) with similar affinity to murine and human TfR1 was used to shuttle protein cargo into the brain. TXB2 was fused to a human IgG1 Fc domain (hFc) or to the amyloid-β (Aβ) antibody bapineuzumab (Bapi). TXB2-hFc displayed 20-fold higher brain concentrations compared with a control VNAR-hFc at 18 hours post-injection in wt mice. At the same time point, brain concentrations of Bapi-TXB2 was threefold higher than Bapi. In transgenic mice overexpressing human Aβ, the brain-to-blood concentration ratio increased with time due to interaction with intracerebral Aβ deposits. The relatively stable threefold difference between Bapi-TXB2 and Bapi was observed for up to 6 days after injection. PET imaging and ex vivo autoradiography revealed more parenchymal distribution of Bapi-TXB2 compared with Bapi. In conclusion, the TXB2 VNAR shuttle markedly increased brain uptake of protein cargo and increased brain concentrations of the Aβ binding antibody Bapi."
https://openalex.org/W3048439368,"Onion (Allium cepa L.) is an important vegetable crop widely grown for diverse culinary and nutraceutical properties. Being a shallow-rooted plant, it is prone to drought. In the present study, transcriptome sequencing of drought-tolerant (1656) and drought-sensitive (1627) onion genotypes was performed to elucidate the molecular basis of differential response to drought stress. A total of 123206 and 139252 transcripts (average transcript length: 690 bases) were generated after assembly for 1656 and 1627, respectively. Differential gene expression analyses revealed upregulation and downregulation of 1189 and 1180 genes, respectively, in 1656, whereas in 1627, upregulation and downregulation of 872 and 1292 genes, respectively, was observed. Genes encoding transcription factors, cytochrome P450, membrane transporters, and flavonoids, and those related to carbohydrate metabolism were found to exhibit a differential expression behavior in the tolerant and susceptible genotypes. The information generated can facilitate a better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying drought response in onion."
https://openalex.org/W3048171369,"TMPRSS2 is an important membrane-anchored serine protease involved in human prostate cancer progression and metastasis. A serine protease physiologically often comes together with a cognate inhibitor for execution of proteolytically biologic function; however, TMPRSS2's cognate inhibitor is still elusive. To identify the cognate inhibitor of TMPRSS2, in this study, we applied co-immunoprecipitation and LC/MS/MS analysis and isolated hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitors (HAIs) to be potential inhibitor candidates for TMPRSS2. Moreover, the recombinant HAI-2 proteins exhibited a better inhibitory effect on TMPRSS2 proteolytic activity than HAI-1, and recombinant HAI-2 proteins had a high affinity to form a complex with TMPRSS2. The immunofluorescence images further showed that TMPRSS2 was co-localized to HAI-2. Both KD1 and KD2 domain of HAI-2 showed comparable inhibitory effects on TMPRSS2 proteolytic activity. In addition, HAI-2 overexpression could suppress the induction effect of TMPRSS2 on pro-HGF activation, extracellular matrix degradation and prostate cancer cell invasion. We further determined that the expression levels of TMPRSS2 were inversely correlated with HAI-2 levels during prostate cancer progression. In orthotopic xenograft animal model, TMPRSS2 overexpression promoted prostate cancer metastasis, and HAI-2 overexpression efficiently blocked TMPRSS2-induced metastasis. In summary, the results together indicate that HAI-2 can function as a cognate inhibitor for TMPRSS2 in human prostate cancer cells and may serve as a potential factor to suppress TMPRSS2-mediated malignancy."

https://openalex.org/W3048302840,"Epigenetic plasticity underpins cell potency, but the extent to which active turnover of DNA methylation contributes to such plasticity is not known, and the underlying pathways are poorly understood. Here we use metabolic labeling with stable isotopes and mass spectrometry to quantitatively address the global turnover of genomic 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (mdC), 5-hydroxymethyl-2'-deoxycytidine (hmdC) and 5-formyl-2'-deoxycytidine (fdC) across mouse pluripotent cell states. High rates of mdC/hmdC oxidation and fdC turnover characterize a formative-like pluripotent state. In primed pluripotent cells, the global mdC turnover rate is about 3-6% faster than can be explained by passive dilution through DNA synthesis. While this active component is largely dependent on ten-eleven translocation (Tet)-mediated mdC oxidation, we unveil additional oxidation-independent mdC turnover, possibly through DNA repair. This process accelerates upon acquisition of primed pluripotency and returns to low levels in lineage-committed cells. Thus, in pluripotent cells, active mdC turnover involves both mdC oxidation-dependent and oxidation-independent processes."
https://openalex.org/W3048202137,"The role of the hippocampus in goal-directed action is currently unclear; studies investigating this issue have produced contradictory results. Here we reconcile these contradictions by demonstrating that, in rats, goal-directed action relies on the dorsal hippocampus, but only transiently, immediately after initial acquisition. Furthermore, we found that goal-directed action also depends transiently on physical context, suggesting a psychological basis for the hippocampal regulation of goal-directed action control."
https://openalex.org/W3048480797,"This study examines catastrophic health expenditures and the potential for such payments to impoverish South African households. The analysis applies three different catastrophic expenditure measurements, and we apply them across four South African Income and Expenditure Surveys. Since households have limited resources, they are also limited in their capacity to purchase health care. Thus, if a household devotes a large share of that capacity to health care, it may not be able to cover other necessary expenses, which could be catastrophic. The measurements differ in their definition of household capacity. Despite the differences in measurements, and, therefore, results, we find limited incidence of health care expenditure catastrophe, although larger shares of capacity are being devoted to health care in more recent years. In line with the finding that catastrophe is rare, we find that very few households are subsequently impoverished, because of health care costs."
https://openalex.org/W3048459290,"This study analyzed the physiological adjustments caused by the use of the Elevation training mask® (2.0), an airflow restriction mask (ARM) during continuous exercise. Eighteen physically active participants (12 men and 6 women) were randomized to two protocols: continuous exercise with mask (CE-ARM) and continuous exercise without mask (CE). Exercise consisted of cycling for 20 minutes at 60% of maximum power. Metabolic variables, lactate, and gas concentration were obtained from arterialized blood samples at pre and post exercise. Continuous expired gases and myoelectric activity of the quadriceps were performed at rest and during the test. We observed no reduction in oxygen saturation in CE-ARM, leading to lower pH, higher carbon dioxide, and greater hematocrit (all p <0.05). The expired gas analysis shows that the CE-ARM condition presented higher oxygen uptake and expired carbon dioxide concentrations (p <0.05). The CE-ARM condition also presented lower ventilatory volume, ventilatory frequency, and expired oxygen pressure (p <0.05). No changes in electromyography activity and lactate concentrations were identified. We conclude that using ARM does not induce hypoxia and represents an additional challenge for the control of acid-base balance, and we suggest the use of ARM as being suitable for respiratory muscle training."
https://openalex.org/W3048824105,"In a broad range of fields it may be desirable to reuse a supervised classification algorithm and apply it to a new data set. However, generalization of such an algorithm and thus achieving a similar classification performance is only possible when the training data used to build the algorithm is similar to new unseen data one wishes to apply it to. It is often unknown in advance how an algorithm will perform on new unseen data, being a crucial reason for not deploying an algorithm at all. Therefore, tools are needed to measure the similarity of data sets. In this paper, we propose the Data Representativeness Criterion (DRC) to determine how representative a training data set is of a new unseen data set. We present a proof of principle, to see whether the DRC can quantify the similarity of data sets and whether the DRC relates to the performance of a supervised classification algorithm. We compared a number of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets, ranging from subtle to severe difference is acquisition parameters. Results indicate that, based on the similarity of data sets, the DRC is able to give an indication as to when the performance of a supervised classifier decreases. The strictness of the DRC can be set by the user, depending on what one considers to be an acceptable underperformance."
https://openalex.org/W3048692119,"The COVID-19 pandemic has already had a shocking impact on the lives of everybody on the planet. Here, we present a modification of the classical SI model, the Fractal Kinetics SI model which is in excellent agreement with the disease outbreak data available from the World Health Organization. The fractal kinetic approach that we propose here originates from chemical kinetics and has successfully been used in the past to describe reaction dynamics when imperfect mixing and segregation of the reactants is important and affects the dynamics of the reaction. The model introduces a novel epidemiological parameter, the “fractal” exponent h which is introduced in order to account for the self-organization of the societies against the pandemic through social distancing, lockdowns and flight restrictions."
https://openalex.org/W3048472521,"Objective Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may present with arthritis implying the risk of being misdiagnosed as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The aim of this study was to identify predictors for ALL based on clinical and laboratory information. Methods This cross-sectional, retrospective study compared clinical presentation and laboratory results of 26 children with ALL and arthritis versus 485 children with JIA (433 non-systemic, 52 systemic JIA). Using a Bayesian score approach the findings were evaluated by calculating odds ratios (OR) and lnOR as a measure of diagnostic weight. Results Distinction on clinical grounds was difficult, as even a high number of joints involved did not exclude ALL. One or more hematologic cell counts were low (Hb <10 g/dL, platelet count <100 x 109/L, neutrophil count < 1.0 x 109/L) in 92% with ALL, 25% with systemic JIA and 10% with non-systemic JIA. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia had the highest ORs of 128 (95% CI 43–387) and 129 (95% CI 26–638), each giving a diagnostic weight of 4. The estimated risks of ALL were 0.2% with normal cell counts and 9%, 67% and 100% when one, two or three cell lines were affected. Conclusion A simple count of cell lines with low counts can serve as a basic diagnostic strategy. Children with tri- or bilinear involvement should be referred to a bone marrow, and those with unilinear involvement a thorough screen for further evidence of ALL (organomegaly, ESR, LDH, uric acid, and blood smear)."
https://openalex.org/W3048514197,"TLR4 is a member of the toll-like receptors (TLR) immune family, which are activated by lipopolysaccharide, ethanol or damaged tissue, among others, by triggering proinflammatory cytokines release and inflammation. Lack of TLR4 protects against inflammatory processes and neuroinflammation linked with several neuropathologies. By considering that miRNAs are key post-transcriptional regulators of the proteins involved in distinct cellular processes, including inflammation, this study aimed to assess the impact of the miRNAs profile in mice cortices lacking the TLR4 response. Using mice cerebral cortices and next-generation sequencing (NGS), the findings showed that lack of TLR4 significantly reduced the quantity and diversity of the miRNAs expressed in WT mice cortices. The results also revealed a significant down-regulation of the miR-200 family, while cluster miR-99b/let-7e/miR-125a was up-regulated in TLR4-KO vs. WT. The bioinformatics and functional analyses demonstrated that TLR4-KO presented the systematic depletion of many pathways closely related to the immune system response, such as cytokine and interleukin signaling, MAPK and ion Channels routes, MyD88 pathways, NF-κβ and TLR7/8 pathways. Our results provide new insights into the molecular and biological processes associated with the protective effects of TLR-KO against inflammatory damage and neuroinflammation, and reveal the relevance of the TLR4 receptors response in many neuropathologies."
https://openalex.org/W3048823769,"Background Compared to other racial/ethnic groups, infant mortality rates (IMR) are persistently highestamong Black infants in the United States, yet there is considerable regional variation. We examined state and county-level contextual factors that may explain regional differences in Black IMR and identified potential strategies for improvement. Methods and findings Black infant mortality data are from the Linked Birth/Infant Death files for 2009–2011. State and county contextual factors within social, economic, environmental, and health domains were compiled from various Census databases, the Food Environment Atlas, and the Area Health Resource File. Region was defined by the nine Census Divisions. We examined contextual associations with Black IMR using aggregated county-level Poisson regression with standard errors adjusted for clustering by state. Overall, Black IMR varied 1.5-fold across regions, ranging from 8.78 per 1,000 in New England to 13.77 per 1,000 in the Midwest. In adjusted models, the following factors were protective for Black IMR: higher state-level Black-White marriage rate (rate ratio (RR) per standard deviation (SD) increase = 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI):0.70–0.95), higher state maternal and child health budget per capita (RR per SD = 0.96, 95% CI:0.92–0.99), and higher county-level Black index of concentration at the extremes (RR per SD = 0.85, 95% CI:0.81–0.90). Modeled variables accounted for 35% of the regional variation in Black IMR. Conclusions These findings are broadly supportive of ongoing public policy efforts to enhance social integration across races, support health and social welfare program spending, and improve economic prosperity. Although contextual factors accounted for about a third of regional variation, further research is needed to more fully understand regional variation in Black IMR disparities."
https://openalex.org/W3048378707,"The impact of cow mammary gland diseases on the quality of colostrum is not conclusively defined; research results are conflicting. However, it is widely believed that mastitis lowers the level of immunoglobulins and the quality of the colostrum produced. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the influence of somatic cell counts (SCC) on the colostrum immunostimulating and chemical components. The experiment was conducted on an experimental organic dairy farm in which a herd of approximately 250 cows was kept in a freestall housing system, with the average performance exceeding 6,000 kg of milk per lactation. Colostrum and milk samples were taken individually from each cow seven times during the experiment: from the first to second day after calving–twice per day, and from the third to fifth day after calving–once per day. Therefore, after preliminary analyses, the cows were divided into two groups based on the cytological quality of their colostrum at the first collection: 1. SCC ≤400,000 cells/ml (good quality colostrum; GCC– 18 cows), 2. SCC ≥ 400,000 cells/ml (low quality colostrum; LCC– 22 cows). The study found almost double the concentration of immunoglobulins and essential fatty acids in first milking colostrum in the GCC group than in colostrum from the LCC group. In addition, an increase in the concentration of lysozyme in first milking colostrum was associated with a decrease in the concentration of immunoglobulins. In addition, the increase in the level of lysozyme was associated with a decrease in the concentration of immunoglobulins. In conclusion, the SCC of first milking colostrum can be used as an indicator of colostrum quality."
https://openalex.org/W3048686641,"Fermented feeds contain abundant organic acids, amino acids, and small peptides, which improve the nutritional status as well as the morphology and microbiota composition of the intestine. Ginseng polysaccharides exhibit several biological activities and contribute to improving intestinal development. Here, Xuefeng black-bone chickens were fed a basal diet fermented by Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Enterococcus faecium, with or without ginseng polysaccharides. The 100% microbially fermented feed (Fe) and 100% microbially fermented feed and ginseng polysaccharide (FP) groups showed significantly increased villus height and villus height to crypt depth ratio, and decreased crypt depth in the jejunum. In the 100% complete feed and ginseng polysaccharide (Po) group, the villus height to crypt depth ratio was significantly increased, crypt depth was reduced, and villus height remained unaffected. Next, we studied the intestinal microbial composition of 32 Xuefeng black-bone chickens. A total of 10 phyla and 442 genera were identified, among which Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the most dominant phyla. At the genus level, Sutterella and Asteroleplasma abundance increased and decreased, respectively, in the FP and Po groups. Sutterella abundance was positively correlated to villus height and villus height to crypt depth ratio, and negatively correlated to crypt depth, and Asteroleplasma abundance was positively correlated to crypt depth and negatively correlated to villus height to crypt depth ratio. At the species level, the FP group showed significantly increased Bacteroides_vulgatus and Eubacterium_tortuosum and decreased Mycoplasma_gallinarum and Asteroleplasma_anaerobium abundance, and the Po group showed significantly increased Mycoplasma_gallinarum and Asteroleplasma_anaerobium abundance. Moreover, bacterial abundance was closely related to the jejunum histomorphology. Asteroleplasma_anaerobium abundance was positively correlated with crypt depth and negatively correlated with villus height to crypt depth ratio. Mycoplasma_gallinarum abundance was positively correlated to villus height, and Bacteroides_vulgatus and Eubacterium_tortuosum abundance was positively correlated with villus height to crypt depth ratio and negatively correlated with crypt depth. Therefore, fermented feeds with ginseng polysaccharides may be used as effective alternatives to antibiotics for improving intestinal morphology and microbial composition."
https://openalex.org/W3048933092,"Among the world’s large Carnivores, American black bears (Ursus americanus) are the foremost conservation success story. Populations have been expanding across North America because the species is adaptable and tolerant of living near people, and because management agencies in the U.S. and Canada controlled hunting and other human-sources of mortality. As a result, human–black bear conflicts (damage to property, general nuisance, threat to human safety) have dramatically increased in some areas, making it urgently important to develop and deploy a variety of mitigation tools. Previous studies claimed that legal hunting did not directly reduce conflicts, but they did not evaluate whether hunting controlled conflicts via management of population size. Here, we compared temporal patterns of phoned-in complaints about black bears (total ~63,500) in Minnesota, USA, over 4 decades to corresponding bear population estimates: both doubled during the first decade. We also quantified natural bear foods, and found that large year-to-year fluctuations affected numbers of complaints; however, since this variation is due largely to weather, this factor cannot be managed. Complaints fell sharply when the management agency (1) shifted more responsibility for preventing and mitigating conflicts to the public; and (2) increased hunting pressure to reduce the bear population. This population reduction was more extreme than intended, however, and after hunting pressure was curtailed, population regrowth was slower than anticipated; consequently both population size and complaints remained at relatively low levels statewide for 2 decades (although with local hotspots). These long-term data indicated that conflicts can be kept in tolerable bounds by managing population size through hunting; but due to the bluntness of this instrument and deficiencies and uncertainties in monitoring and manipulating populations, it is wiser to maintain a population at a level where conflicts are socially-acceptable than try to reduce it once it is well beyond that point."
https://openalex.org/W3048519515,"Vitamin D status is closely related to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. This study explored the effect of intestinal vitamin D signaling on necroptosis and the underlying mechanism in colitis. Serum 25(OH)D levels and the expression of necroptotic proteins were examined in patients with IBD. Colitis was induced in an intestinal-specific hVDR transgenic model, and the gross manifestation, histological integrity, and intestinal barrier function were tested. The findings were further confirmed in vitro. Immunoprecipitation and colocalization were performed to investigate the association between the vitamin D receptor and necroptotic proteins. We found that serum 25(OH)D decreased in patients with IBD, while the expression of necroptotic proteins increased. The intestinal hVDR transgenic model could largely ameliorate the structural destruction, restore barrier dysfunction, and suppress necroptosis caused by DSS. This was probably achieved by binding to RIPK1/3 necrosomes, as we observed decreased RIPK1/3 necrosome formation and increased VDR expression in the cytosol. This study demonstrated an inhibitory effect of the intestinal vitamin D signaling pathway on necroptosis in DSS-induced colitis. The vitamin D receptor shifts from the nucleus to the cytosol to impede the formation of RIPK1/3. Our findings may offer some theoretical basis for a novel treatment of IBD in clinical practice."

The response to heat stress is a complex regulatory process; however, the exact mechanism in eggplant is unknown. We analyzed the transcriptome of eggplant under different high-temperature treatments using RNA-Seq technology. Three libraries treated at high temperatures were generated and sequenced. There were 40,733,667, 40,833,852, and 40,301,285 clean reads with 83.98%, 79.69%, and 84.42% of sequences mapped to the eggplant reference genome in groups exposed to 28°C (CK), 38°C (T38), and 43°C (T43), respectively. There were 3,067 and 1,456 DEGs in T38 vs CK and T43 vs CK groups, respectively. In these two DEG groups, 315 and 342 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in common. Differential expression patterns of DEGs in antioxidant enzyme systems, detoxication, phytohormones, and transcription factors under heat stress were investigated. We screened heat stress-related genes for further validation by qRT-PCR. Regulation mechanisms may differ under different temperature treatments, in which heat shock proteins and heat stress transcription factors play vital roles. These results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of the heat stress response in eggplant and may be useful in crop breeding."
https://openalex.org/W3048877702,"Purpose Pulse wave velocity (PWV), an indicator of vascular stiffness, increases with age and is increasingly recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although many mechanical and chemical factors underlie the stiffness of the elastic artery, genetic risk factors related to age-dependent increases in PWV in apparently healthy people are largely unknown. The transcription factor nuclear factor E2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which is activated by unidirectional vascular pulsatile shear stress or oxidative stress, regulates vascular redox homeostasis. Previous reports have shown that a SNP in the NRF2 gene regulatory region (−617C>A; hereafter called SNP−617) affects NRF2 gene expression such that the minor A allele confers lower gene expression compared to the C allele, and it is associated with various diseases, including CVD. We aimed to investigate whether SNP−617 affects vascular stiffness with aging in apparently healthy people. Methods Analyzing wide-ranging data obtained from a public health survey performed in Japan, we evaluated whether SNP−617 affected brachial-ankle PWV (baPWV) in never-smoking healthy subjects (n = 642). We also evaluated the effects of SNP−617 on other cardiovascular and blood test measurements. Results We have shown that not only AA carriers (n = 55) but also CA carriers (n = 247) show arterial stiffness compared to CC carriers (n = 340). Furthermore, SNP−617 also affected blood pressure indexes such as systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure but not the ankle brachial pressure index, an indicator of atherosclerosis. Multivariate analysis showed that SNP−617 accelerates the incremental ratio of baPWV with age. Conclusions This study is the first to show that SNP−617 affects the age-dependent increase in vascular stiffness. Our results indicate that low NRF2 activity induces premature vascular aging and could be targeted for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases associated with aging."

The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 was reported to function as a negative regulator of inflammatory cytokine production by inhibiting activation of NF-κB and MAPKs during bacterial infection, however, the role of SHP-1 in regulating type I interferons remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that knockout or knockdown of SHP-1 in macrophages promoted both HSV-1- and VSV-induced antiviral immune response. Conversely, overexpression of SHP-1 in L929 cells suppressed the HSV-1- and VSV-induced immune response; suppression was directly dependent on phosphatase activity. We identified a direct interaction between SHP-1 and TRAF3; the association between these two proteins resulted in diminished recruitment of CK1e to TRAF3 and inhibited its K63-linked ubiquitination; SHP-1 inhibited K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 by promoting dephosphorylation at Tyr116 and Tyr446. Taken together, our results identify SHP-1 as a negative regulator of antiviral immunity and suggest that SHP-1 may be a target for intervention in acute virus infection."

https://openalex.org/W3048489115,"Naproxen is a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the control of postoperative inflammatory signs and symptoms in dentistry. Its association with esomeprazole has been widely studied and has yielded good results for the control of acute pain, even with the delayed absorption of naproxen owing to the presence of esomeprazole. To further understand the absorption, distribution, and metabolism of this drug alone and in combination with esomeprazole, we will analyze the pharmacokinetic parameters of naproxen and its major metabolite, 6-O-desmethylnaproxen, in saliva samples. A rapid, sensitive, and selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method for the simultaneous determination of naproxen and 6-O-desmethylnaproxen in saliva will be developed and validated. Sequential saliva samples from six patients will be analyzed before and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 8, 11, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after the ingestion of one naproxen tablet (500 mg) and esomeprazole-associated naproxen tablets (500 + 20 mg), at two different times. After liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate and HCl, the samples will be analyzed using an 8040 Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Separation of naproxen and its major metabolic products will be performed using a Shim-Pack XR-ODS 75Lx2.0 column and C18 pre-column (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at 40°C using a mixture of methanol and 10 mM ammonium acetate (70:30, v/v) with an injection flow of 0.3 mL/min. The total analytical run time will be 5 min. The detection and quantification of naproxen and its metabolite will be validated, which elucidate the pharmacokinetics of this drug, thereby contributing to its proper prescription for the medical and dental interventions that cause acute pain."
https://openalex.org/W3048661620,"The incidence of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is increasing over the years despite current prevention and control policies in Singapore. A retrospective case-control study was conducted among parents whose children attended childcare centres in Singapore to assess the epidemiological risk factors associated with HFMD among children below 7 years old. Parents of 363 children with HFMD (as cases) and 362 children without HFMD (as controls) were enrolled from 22 childcare centres. Data of potential risk factors were collected through a standardised self-administered questionnaire from parents which include demographics and hygiene practices. Multivariate analysis were adjusted for age group, parent’s education level, mother's age, HFMD-infected siblings, and preschool admission period. Child’s age between 1.5 and 4.9 years, child who had been in childcare for more than 1.9years, having HFMD-infected siblings, two or more children in a family, higher educated parents, parents who had HFMD episode previously, wash toys with soap once every two to three weeks, sanitise toys once every two to three weeks, out-sourced cleaner in childcare centre, no domestic helper at home and more than 22 children in a classroom were independent risk factors of HFMD. These evidence provide crucial implications to guide more effective prevention and control of HFMD in Singapore."
https://openalex.org/W3048676701,"Objective To analyze the relationship of Adler grade by transvaginal color Doppler flow imaging (TV-CDFI) and the clinical pathological parameters of patients with cervical cancer, and to identify the value of Adler grade in the diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer. Methods Patients with cervical cancer diagnosed pathologically in our hospital from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 were included, All patients underwent TV-CDFI examination, and the images were divided into 0 to III grades according to the Adler grades, and the correlations between the Adler classification and clinical pathological parameters (clinical stage, mass size, pathological type, squamous cell carcinoma subtype, CA125, CA199) were analyzed. Results A total of 162 patients with cervical cancer were included. With the increase of Adler severity, the clinical stage of cervical cancer increased accordingly. the cancer size differed significantly in patients with different Adler grade (p = 0.004); There were significant differences in the level of CA125, CA199 between the squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma (all p<0.05). the Adler grade was positively related with the clinical stage, pathological type and squamous cell carcinoma subtypes of cervical cancer (all p<0.05), no correlations were found among the Adler grade and the cancer size, CA125, CA199 (all p>0.05). The area under ROC curve of the cervical squamous cell carcinoma predicted by Adler grade based on FIGO results and pathological results was 0.811and 0.762 respectively (all p<0.05). Conclusions Adler grades are closely associated with the clinical pathology of cervical cancer, which may be a convenient and effective approach for the assisting assessment of cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3048861244,"As aquatic invasive species (AIS) proliferate worldwide, a better understanding of their roles in invaded habitats is needed to inform management and introduction prevention strategies and priorities. Metabarcoding of stomach content DNA (scDNA) shows considerable promise in such regard. We thus metabarcoded scDNA from two non-native fish species (alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax)), and three native ones (bloater (Coregonus hoyi), ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus)). Fishes (N = 376) were sampled in spring 2009 and 2010 from 73–128 m depths at three Lake Michigan sites. Four mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) primer sets designed to target five potential AIS prey, and a universal aquatic invertebrate CO1 primer set targeting both native and AIS prey were used. Quality controlled prey amplicons were matched to three AIS prey: Bythotrephes longimanus (mean percent frequency occurrence, all samples = 7%), Cercopagis pengoi (5%), and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (11%). Neither invasive prey Dreissena polymorpha nor Hemimysis anomala were detected. Native prey Leptodiaptomus sicilis, Limnocalanus macrurus, and Mysis diluviana were relatively common in scDNA (respective mean percent occurrences, all samples: 48%, 25%, 42%). Analysis of variation in prey occurrences for sample site, predator species, sample year, sample depth, and predator total length (TL) indicated site and predator species were most important. However, B. longimanus occurrence in scDNA depended upon predator TL, perhaps indicative of its unique defensive spine limiting susceptibility to predation until fishes exceed species-specific gape-based limitations. Our analysis of native and invasive prey species indicated possible indirect AIS impacts such as native predators switching their diet due to AIS-driven losses of preferred native prey. Metabarcoding demonstrated that AIS are integrated components of the offshore Lake Michigan food web, with both native and non-native predators, and both invasive and native prey are affecting species interactions across multiple trophic levels."
https://openalex.org/W3048551493,"Neddylation plays a distinct role in stabilization of a subset of ribosomal proteins. Whether the family of ribosomal proteins S27 (RPS27 and RPS27-like) is subjected to neddylation regulation with associated biological consequence is totally unknown. Here, we report that both family members are subjected to neddylation by MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, and deneddylation by NEDP1. Blockage of neddylation with MLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of neddylation-activating enzyme, destabilizes RPS27L and RPS27 by shortening their protein half-lives. Biologically, knockdown of RPS27L and RPS27 sensitizes, whereas ectopic expression of RPS27L and RPS27 desensitizes cancer cells to MLN4924-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our study demonstrates that neddylation stabilizes RPS27L and RPS27 to confer the survival of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3048669518,"This paper provides a solution for fast haptic information gain during soft tissue palpation using a Variable Lever Mechanism (VLM) probe. More specifically, we investigate the impact of stiffness variation of the probe to condition likelihood functions of the kinesthetic force and tactile sensors measurements during a palpation task for two sweeping directions. Using knowledge obtained from past probing trials or Finite Element (FE) simulations, we implemented this likelihood conditioning in an autonomous palpation control strategy. Based on a recursive Bayesian inferencing framework, this new control strategy adapts the sweeping direction and the stiffness of the probe to detect abnormal stiff inclusions in soft tissues. This original control strategy for compliant palpation probes shows a sub-millimeter accuracy for the 3D localization of the nodules in a soft tissue phantom as well as a 100% reliability detecting the existence of nodules in a soft phantom."

https://openalex.org/W3048730692,"Ischemic neuropathy is common in subjects with critical limb ischemia, frequently causing chronic neuropathic pain. However, neuropathic pain caused by ischemia is hard to control despite the restoration of an adequate blood flow. Here, we used a rat model of ischemic-reperfusion nerve injury (IRI) to investigate possible effects of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) against ischemic neuropathy. Hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ) liposomes containing plasmids encoded with HGF was delivered into the peripheral nervous system by retrograde axonal transport following its repeated injections into the tibialis anterior muscle in the right hindlimb. First HGF gene transfer was done immediately after IRI, and repeated at 1, 2 and 3 weeks later. Rats with IRI exhibited pronounced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, decreased blood flow and skin temperature, and lowered thresholds of plantar stimuli in the hind paw. These were all significantly improved by HGF gene transfer, as also were sciatic nerve conduction velocity and muscle action potential amplitudes. Histologically, HGF gene transfer resulted in a significant increase of endoneurial microvessels in sciatic and tibial nerves and promoted nerve regeneration which were confirmed by morphometric analysis. Neovascularization was observed in the contralateral side of peripheral nerves as well. In addition, IRI elevated mRNA levels of P2X3 and P2Y1 receptors, and transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV1) in sciatic nerves, dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord, and these elevated levels were inhibited by HGF gene transfer. In conclusion, HGF gene transfer is a potent candidate for treatment of acute ischemic neuropathy caused by reperfusion injury, because of robust angiogenesis and enhanced nerve regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3048668021,"The majority of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cases are caused by a chromosomal translocation linking the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene to the Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene-1 (ABL1), creating the mutant fusion protein BCR-ABL1. Downstream of BCR-ABL1 is growth factor receptor-bound protein-2 (GRB2), an intracellular adapter protein that binds to BCR-ABL1 via its src-homology-2 (SH2) domain. This binding constitutively activates growth pathways, downregulates apoptosis, and leads to an over proliferation of immature and dysfunctional myeloid cells. Utilizing novel synthetic methods, we developed four furo-quinoxaline compounds as GRB2 SH2 domain antagonists with the goal of disrupting this leukemogenic signaling. One of the four antagonists, NHD2-15, showed a significant reduction in proliferation of K562 cells, a human BCR-ABL1+ leukemic cell line. To elucidate the mode of action of these compounds, various biophysical, in vitro, and in vivo assays were performed. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays indicated that NHD2-15 antagonized GRB2, binding with a KD value of 119 ± 2 μM. Cellulose nitrate (CN) assays indicated that the compound selectively bound the SH2 domain of GRB2. Western blot assays suggested the antagonist downregulated proteins involved in leukemic transformation. Finally, NHD2-15 was nontoxic to primary cells and adult zebrafish, indicating that it may be an effective clinical treatment for CML."
https://openalex.org/W3048619337,"Introduction Improvement of women’s knowledge and attitude toward vaginal birth is recognized as an important strategy to control caesarean sections (CS) on maternal request. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a mass-media campaign in improving knowledge, attitude and intention of women for vaginal birth. Methods This was a population-based study carried out in Tehran, Iran. A national ‘No to unnecessary caesarean sections’ campaign was launched in April 2016 and was televised for ten days. A random sample of pregnant women from all defined geographical areas of Tehran were recruited and assessed for knowledge about the benefits of vaginal birth and the risk of CS, attitude and intention toward mode of delivery at two points in time: before and after the campaign. A comparison was made to evaluate outcome measures among those who had seen the campaign and those who had not. Results In all, 37 public and private maternity care centers were selected randomly and 702 eligible pregnant women attending these centers were entered in the study. Pre- and post-intervention data for 466 women were available for analysis. Of these, 194 women indicated that they had seen the campaign and the remaining 272 women said that they had not. A comparison of the outcome measures between the two study groups showed that there were significant differences between those who had seen the campaign and those who had not. Those who had seen the campaign reported increased knowledge, had a more positive attitude and indicated increased behavioral intention toward vaginal birth. Conclusions In general, the findings indicated that the mass-media campaign improved pregnant women’s knowledge, attitude and intention towards vaginal birth. However, the long-term effects of such campaigns need further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3048882472,"Understanding human societies requires knowing how they develop gender hierarchies, which are ubiquitous. We test whether a simple agent-based dynamic process could create gender inequality. Relying on evidence of gendered status concerns, self-construals, and cognitive habits, our model included a gender difference in how responsive male-like and female-like agents are to others’ opinions about the level of esteem for someone. We simulate a population who interact in pairs of randomly selected agents to influence each other about their esteem judgments of self and others. Half the agents are more influenced by their relative status rank during the interaction than the others. Without prejudice, stereotypes, segregation, or categorization, our model produces inter-group inequality of self-esteem and status that is stable, consensual, and exhibits characteristics of glass ceiling effects. Outcomes are not affected by relative group size. We discuss implications for group orientation to dominance and individuals’ motivations to exchange."

https://openalex.org/W3048779301,"In clinical trials, animal and cell line models are often used to evaluate the potential toxic effects of a novel compound or candidate drug before progressing to human trials. However, relating the results of animal and in vitro model exposures to relevant clinical outcomes in the human in vivo system still proves challenging, relying on often putative orthologs. In recent years, multiple studies have demonstrated that the repeated dose rodent bioassay, the current gold standard in the field, lacks sufficient sensitivity and specificity in predicting toxic effects of pharmaceuticals in humans. In this study, we evaluate the potential of deep learning techniques to translate the pattern of gene expression measured following an exposure in rodents to humans, circumventing the current reliance on orthologs, and also from in vitro to in vivo experimental designs. Of the applied deep learning architectures applied in this study the convolutional neural network (CNN) and a deep artificial neural network with bottleneck architecture significantly outperform classical machine learning techniques in predicting the time series of gene expression in primary human hepatocytes given a measured time series of gene expression from primary rat hepatocytes following exposure in vitro to a previously unseen compound across multiple toxicologically relevant gene sets. With a reduction in average mean absolute error across 76 genes that have been shown to be predictive for identifying carcinogenicity from 0.0172 for a random regression forest to 0.0166 for the CNN model (p < 0.05). These deep learning architecture also perform well when applied to predict time series of in vivo gene expression given measured time series of in vitro gene expression for rats."
https://openalex.org/W2912607495,"The extensive use of social media for sharing and obtaining information has resulted in the development of topic detection models to facilitate the comprehension of the overwhelming amount of short and distributed posts. Probabilistic topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and matrix factorization based approaches such as Latent Semantic Analysis and Non-negative Matrix Factorization represent topics as sets of terms that are useful for many automated processes. However, the determination of what a topic is about is left as a further task. Alternatively, techniques that produce summaries are human comprehensible, but less suitable for automated processing. This work proposes an approach that utilizes Linked Open Data (LOD) resources to extract semantically represented topics from collections of microposts. The proposed approach utilizes entity linking to identify the elements of topics from microposts. The elements are related through co-occurrence graphs, which are processed to yield topics. The topics are represented using an ontology that is introduced for this purpose. A prototype of the approach is used to identify topics from 11 datasets consisting of more than one million posts collected from Twitter during various events, such as the 2016 US election debates and the death of Carrie Fisher. The characteristics of the approach with more than 5 thousand generated topics are described in detail. The potentials of semantic topics in revealing information, that is not otherwise easily observable, is demonstrated with semantic queries of various complexities. A human evaluation of topics from 36 randomly selected intervals resulted in a precision of 81.0% and F1 score of 93.3%. Furthermore, they are compared with topics generated from the same datasets from an approach that produces human readable topics from microblog post collections."
https://openalex.org/W3048570108,"Life does not sustain without water. For water, there is a natural abundance of stable isotope hydrogen and oxygen. Water molecules get across cell membranes through a plasma membrane protein, named aquaporin. Moreover, the kidney is the main organ to maintain water homeostasis. Here, we study the stable isotopic ratios of hydrogen and oxygen in human blood plasma and erythrocyte corresponding to kidney functions. We extract waters from human plasma and erythrocyte, collected from 110 participants, including 51 clinically stable outpatients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and 59 subjects with normal renal function (NRF). We observed that (i) both extracellular (blood plasma) and intracellular (erythrocyte) biology waters are isotopic differences between the ESRD and NRF participants, (ii) the natural abundance of isotopic waters of ESRD is hypo-isotopic, and (iii) the isotopic enrichment of water between erythrocyte and blood plasma are distinct. In addition, we introduce an empirical formula using entropy transformation to describe isotopic water enrichment for biology. Accordingly, the natural abundance of stable isotope water of blood plasma and erythrocyte may be possibly put in practice a new sign for assessments of kidney dysfunctions."
