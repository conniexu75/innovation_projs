https://openalex.org/W2061522141,"Notch signaling is a key developmental pathway that is subject to frequent genetic and epigenetic perturbations in many different human tumors. Here we investigate whether long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes, in addition to mRNAs, are key downstream targets of oncogenic Notch1 in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). By integrating transcriptome profiles with chromatin state maps, we have uncovered many previously unreported T-ALL-specific lncRNA genes, a fraction of which are directly controlled by the Notch1/Rpbjκ activator complex. Finally we have shown that one specific Notch-regulated lncRNA, LUNAR1, is required for efficient T-ALL growth in vitro and in vivo due to its ability to enhance IGF1R mRNA expression and sustain IGF1 signaling. These results confirm that lncRNAs are important downstream targets of the Notch signaling pathway, and additionally they are key regulators of the oncogenic state in T-ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2069692197,"MicroRNAs are well known to mediate translational repression and mRNA degradation in the cytoplasm. Various microRNAs have also been detected in membrane-compartmentalized organelles, but the functional significance has remained elusive. Here, we report that miR-1, a microRNA specifically induced during myogenesis, efficiently enters the mitochondria where it unexpectedly stimulates, rather than represses, the translation of specific mitochondrial genome-encoded transcripts. We show that this positive effect requires specific miR:mRNA base-pairing and Ago2, but not its functional partner GW182, which is excluded from the mitochondria. We provide evidence for the direct action of Ago2 in mitochondrial translation by crosslinking immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (CLIP-seq), functional rescue with mitochondria-targeted Ago2, and selective inhibition of the microRNA machinery in the cytoplasm. These findings unveil a positive function of microRNA in mitochondrial translation and suggest a highly coordinated myogenic program via miR-1-mediated translational stimulation in the mitochondria and repression in the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2079488858,"Stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment are essential for tumor progression and metastasis. Surprisingly little is known about the factors that drive the transcriptional reprogramming of stromal cells within tumors. We report that the transcriptional regulator heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is frequently activated in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), where it is a potent enabler of malignancy. HSF1 drives a transcriptional program in CAFs that complements, yet is completely different from, the program it drives in adjacent cancer cells. This CAF program is uniquely structured to support malignancy in a non-cell-autonomous way. Two central stromal signaling molecules-TGF-β and SDF1-play a critical role. In early-stage breast and lung cancer, high stromal HSF1 activation is strongly associated with poor patient outcome. Thus, tumors co-opt the ancient survival functions of HSF1 to orchestrate malignancy in both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous ways, with far-reaching therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2007056945,"Adaptation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathway for MHC class I (MHC-I) presentation in dendritic cells enables cross-presentation of peptides derived from phagocytosed microbes, infected cells, or tumor cells to CD8 T cells. How these peptides intersect with MHC-I molecules remains poorly understood. Here, we show that MHC-I selectively accumulate within phagosomes carrying microbial components, which engage Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Although cross-presentation requires Sec22b-mediated phagosomal recruitment of the peptide loading complex from the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), this step is independent of TLR signaling and does not deliver MHC-I. Instead, MHC-I are recruited from an endosomal recycling compartment (ERC), which is marked by Rab11a, VAMP3/cellubrevin, and VAMP8/endobrevin and holds large reserves of MHC-I. While Rab11a activity stocks ERC stores with MHC-I, MyD88-dependent TLR signals drive IκB-kinase (IKK)2-mediated phosphorylation of phagosome-associated SNAP23. Phospho-SNAP23 stabilizes SNARE complexes orchestrating ERC-phagosome fusion, enrichment of phagosomes with ERC-derived MHC-I, and subsequent cross-presentation during infection."
https://openalex.org/W2088469132,"Circadian rhythms are intimately linked to cellular metabolism. Specifically, the NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1, the founding member of the sirtuin family, contributes to clock function. Whereas SIRT1 exhibits diversity in deacetylation targets and subcellular localization, SIRT6 is the only constitutively chromatin-associated sirtuin and is prominently present at transcriptionally active genomic loci. Comparison of the hepatic circadian transcriptomes reveals that SIRT6 and SIRT1 separately control transcriptional specificity and therefore define distinctly partitioned classes of circadian genes. SIRT6 interacts with CLOCK:BMAL1 and, differently from SIRT1, governs their chromatin recruitment to circadian gene promoters. Moreover, SIRT6 controls circadian chromatin recruitment of SREBP-1, resulting in the cyclic regulation of genes implicated in fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism. This mechanism parallels a phenotypic disruption in fatty acid metabolism in SIRT6 null mice as revealed by circadian metabolome analyses. Thus, genomic partitioning by two independent sirtuins contributes to differential control of circadian metabolism."

Chromatin replication, during S phase, and chromatin condensation, during prophase, generate torsional stress at the level of the DNA fiber and DNA topoisomerases assist the replication and condensation processes to resolve the topological complexity. Unsolved topological constrains lead to highly recombinogenic and aberrant DNA transitions, DNA entangling, and breakage. In mammals, lamin-associated chromatin imposes topological impediments during chromatin replication and condensation (Bermejo et al., 2012aBermejo R. Kumar A. Foiani M.

The nuclear envelope (NE) is connected with the cytoskeleton (Martins et al., 2012Martins R.P. Finan J.D. Guilak F. Lee D.A. Mechanical regulation of nuclear structure and function.Annu. Rev. Biomed.

Dev. 2009; 19: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The mammalian NE has two components: the solid-elastic lamina and fluid-like membranes. The inner nucleus behaves like a compressible gel (Rowat et al., 2006Rowat A.C. Lammerding J. Ipsen J.H. Mechanical properties of the cell nucleus and the effect of emerin deficiency.Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 4649-4664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and the nucleoskeleton is 5- to 10-fold stiffer than cytoskeleton (Simon and Wilson, 2011Simon D.N. Wilson K.L. The nucleoskeleton as a genome-associated dynamic ‘network of networks’.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 695-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Being deformable, the NE is an ideal elastic structure for adsorbing and/or transducing mechanical stimuli arising inside or outside the nucleus. Chromatin dynamics generates mechanical forces that can be transmitted to the NE through the lamin-associated chromatin domains. In yeast, when replication forks approach chromatin domains that are connected to the NE, the Mec1/ATR pathway regulates key nucleoporins to detach these chromatin regions from the NE, thus facilitating fork progression (Bermejo et al., 2011Bermejo R. Capra T. Jossen R. Colosio A. Frattini C. Carotenuto W. Cocito A. Doksani Y. Klein H. Gómez-González B. et al.The replication checkpoint protects fork stability by releasing transcribed genes from nuclear pores.Cell. 2011; 146: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This event prevents aberrant topological transitions that would otherwise lead to forks reversal (Sogo et al., 2002Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Fork reversal and ssDNA accumulation at stalled replication forks owing to checkpoint defects.Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) and genome rearrangements (Bermejo et al., 2012bBermejo R. Lai M.S. Foiani M. Preventing replication stress to maintain genome stability: resolving conflicts between replication and transcription.Mol. Cell. 2012; 45: 710-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, it remained unclear how ATR senses that chromatin must be detached from the NE when forks are approaching. Moreover, does ATR play a similar role in prophase when condensation engages chromatin domains associated to the NE? Intriguingly, it has been shown that ATR contains many HEAT repeats (Perry and Kleckner, 2003Perry J. Kleckner N. The ATRs, ATMs, and TORs are giant HEAT repeat proteins.Cell. 2003; 112: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) that can behave as elastic connectors (Grinthal et al., 2010Grinthal A. Adamovic I. Weiner B. Karplus M. Kleckner N. PR65, the HEAT-repeat scaffold of phosphatase PP2A, is an elastic connector that links force and catalysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 2467-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting that ATR might be influenced by mechanical forces. We therefore investigated whether ATR responds to the mechanical stimuli deriving from chromosomal dynamics. We found that a fraction of human and mouse ATR localizes at the NE during S phase, particularly under conditions of enhanced replication stress, and in prophase of unperturbed cell cycles. Osmotic stress or mechanical stimulation of the plasma membrane cause relocalization of ATR to the inner and outer nuclear membranes, independently of the cell-cycle stage and of RPA or DNA damage. Thus, ATR responds to mechanical forces at the NE. Our observations suggest that ATR mediates a mechanical response to membrane stress that could be caused by chromatin dynamics and is important for genome integrity. DNA torsional stress generates mechanical strain and arises during chromatin condensation, when the DNA packaging reaches the maximal complexity and, transiently, during S phase (Wang, 2002Wang J.C. Cellular roles of DNA topoisomerases: a molecular perspective.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). Based on our previous findings (Bermejo et al., 2011Bermejo R. Capra T. Jossen R. Colosio A. Frattini C. Carotenuto W. Cocito A. Doksani Y. Klein H. Gómez-González B. et al.The replication checkpoint protects fork stability by releasing transcribed genes from nuclear pores.Cell. 2011; 146: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we reasoned that lamin-associated chromatin might mediate the transfer of mechanical forces resulting from DNA torsional stress to the NE. Given the data on ATR discussed above from our laboratories and others’, we tested whether ATR localizes at the NE. We examined ATR localization by indirect immunofluorescence (IF), using an anti-ATR antibody (Ab), the specificity of which was validated in HeLa cells depleted for ATR (Figure S1A available online) and in ATR-defective human Seckel fibroblasts (Figure S1B). In asynchronous HeLa cells, ATR localized mostly in the nucleus in interphase and S phase cells (Figure 1A). In prophase, part of ATR exhibited a perinuclear distribution, which was lost later in mitosis, following NE breakdown (NEBD) (Figure 1A). Using structured illumination super resolution microscopy (SR-SIM), we analyzed ATR and Nup153 colocalization in prophase cells. Both proteins localized at the NE (Figure 1B), exhibiting 70% colocalization. Consistently, several nucleoporins, including Nup153, are targeted by ATR/Chk1 (Blasius et al., 2011Blasius M. Forment J.V. Thakkar N. Wagner S.A. Choudhary C. Jackson S.P. A phospho-proteomic screen identifies substrates of the checkpoint kinase Chk1.Genome Biol. 2011; 12: R78Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, Matsuoka et al., 2007Matsuoka S.

Lerenthal Y. et al.ATM and ATR substrate analysis reveals extensive protein networks responsive to DNA damage.Science. 2007; 316: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (2357) Google Scholar). Notably, ATR was prominently enriched at NE invaginations (Figure S1C), which often mediate the mechanical attachment of nucleoli and spindles (Beaudouin et al., 2002Beaudouin J. Gerlich D. Daigle N.

Hemon D. Bouteille M. Structural relationship between the nucleolus and the nuclear envelope.J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1979; 68: 328-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The observations described above were confirmed in primary human IMR90 and murine NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Figure S1C). In leptomycin B (a nuclear export inhibitor; Kudo et al., 1998Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Leptomycin B inhibition of signal-mediated nuclear export by direct binding to CRM1.Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar)-treated prophase cells, ATR intracellular distribution did not change (Figure S1D), thus arguing against a contribution of nuclear export to ATR localization. Cellular distribution of ATR was further analyzed by electron microscopy (EM). Gold ATR immunostaining revealed a nuclear and nonnuclear distribution of ATR particles (Figure 1C). A fraction of these particles localized at the NE, particularly in prophase. Indeed, whereas in interphase, among the ATR particles visible in the nucleus, 90.5% ± 3% were in the nucleoplasm and 9.5% ± 3% were at the NE, in prophase cells, 78.4% ± 3.3% were in the nucleoplasm and 21.6% ± 3.4% were at the NE.Figure 1A Fraction of ATR Localizes at the NE during the Cell CycleShow full caption(A) Confocal images of cells stained with anti-ATR Ab (green), DAPI (blue), EdU (red), or p-H3 (red).

Because ATR and Chk1 have been found associated with centrosomes (Krämer et al., 2004Krämer A. Mailand N. Lukas C. Syljuåsen R.G. Wilkinson C.J. Nigg E.A. Bartek J. Lukas J.

Grosse F. Centrosomal localization of DNA damage checkpoint proteins.J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 101: 451-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we costained prophase cells with Abs against ATR and α-tubulin (Figure 2A). The ATR fraction associated with centrosomes was lower compared to the one bound to the NE and partially overlapped in places in which centrosomes contact NE. Colcemid (a microtubule-depolymerizing drug) treatment, did not affect ATR-NE association (Figure 2A). Hence, the NE-bound ATR in prophase unlikely depends on centrosomes and microtubule polymerization. Next, we examined whether the NE distribution of ATR depended on its kinase activity and whether other checkpoint factors exhibited a similar localization. We did not observe changes in the NE distribution of ATR following treatment with an ATR inhibitor (ATRi) (Toledo et al., 2011Toledo L.I. Murga M. Zur R. Soria R. Rodriguez A. Martinez S. Oyarzabal J. Pastor J. Bischoff J.R. Fernandez-Capetillo O. A cell-based screen identifies ATR inhibitors with synthetic lethal properties for cancer-associated mutations.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). We also found that a fraction of ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP) was localized at the NE along with Nup153 (Figure 2C). Under unperturbed conditions, Chk1 is phosphorylated at serine 345 during mitosis, and this event is essential for viability (Wilsker et al., 2008Wilsker D. Petermann E. Helleday T. Bunz F. Essential function of Chk1 can be uncoupled from DNA damage checkpoint and replication control.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 20752-20757Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We found a prophase-specific NE localization of p-Chk1 that was inhibited by ATRi treatment (Figure 2D). The specificity of the anti-phospho-Ser 345-Chk1 Ab was confirmed in HU-treated cells (Figure S2). Hence, fractions of ATR, ATRIP, and p-Chk1 localize at the NE during the cell cycle, under physiological conditions; ATR association with the NE does not depend on its kinase activity. We also found that ATR and p-Chk1 distributed around the NE following aphidicoline- (Figure 2E) and hydroxyurea- (HU) (data not shown) induced replication stress. Altogether, these results are consistent with the initial hypothesis that topological stress accumulating during chromatin condensation in prophase and during chromatin replication following replication stress evokes a response at the NE that leads to ATR recruitment and activation. To more specifically address whether the NE ATR response is triggered by the NE undergoing mechanical stress, we adopted a variety of cell manipulation assays that are routinely used to induce mechanical stress at cell membranes, including osmotic stress, patch-clamp-induced cell stretching, and cell compression. We first analyzed ATR distribution in response to osmotic stress, a potent inducer of mechanotransduction at cell membranes (Martins et al., 2012Martins R.P. Finan J.D. Guilak F. Lee D.A. Mechanical regulation of nuclear structure and function.Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2012; 14: 431-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Under hyperosmotic conditions, the cell and the nucleus shrink, causing NE ruffling and chromatin condensation (Martins et al., 2012Martins R.P. Finan J.D. Guilak F. Lee D.A. Mechanical regulation of nuclear structure and function.Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2012; 14: 431-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Hypotonic stress causes cell swelling and induces membrane tension but also alters the chromatin structure, apparently without causing DNA breaks (Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. DNA damage activates ATM through intermolecular autophosphorylation and dimer dissociation.Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2685) Google Scholar). Hypertonic and hypotonic conditions caused Chk1 phosphorylation in an ATR-dependent manner (Figure 3A). By IF, we then compared the ATR and chromatin cellular distribution in cells growing under normal conditions or treated with sorbitol (Figure 3B). Compared to untreated conditions, hyperosmotic stress caused a redistribution of ATR at the NE that did not correlate with changes in chromatin localization (Figure S3A). We observed ATR redistribution at the NE in response to sorbitol treatment in U2OS and IMR90 cells as well (Figure S3B). By time-lapse analysis in HeLa cells, we found that GFP-ATR relocalized on the NE within 30 seconds (s) following hypertonic stress (data not shown). By EM, we further investigated ATR association to the NE in cells treated with sorbitol. Whereas in isotonic conditions ATR particles accumulated mostly within the karyoplasm, in response to hypertonic stress, a significant fraction of ATR particles accumulated at the NE (Figure 3C). ATR nanogold particles localize at both the inner and the outer membranes. ATRIP and p-Chk1 also localized, in part, at the NE in response to sorbitol treatment (Figures 3D and S3C) in an ATR-dependent manner (Figure 3D). Hence, the NE is a site for ATR activation, following hyperosmotic stress. We obtained analogous results in different cell types, both cancer cell lines and normal diploid cells, and using other hyperosmotic conditions (0.4 M NaCl) (Figures S3B and S3D).Figure S3Osmotic Stress Induces ATR Activation and Nuclear Envelope Relocalization, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Redistribution of ATR and chromatin in response to osmotic stress.

Graphs show the number of foci with signal intensity higher than the basal γ−H2AX levels observed (bottom panel) on a representative set of cells (n > 75). (E) HeLa cells were either mock treated or with nuclear export inhibitor Laptomycin B (10 nM; 2hrs.) followed by treatment with hypertonic medium (0.5 M Sorbitol; 20-30 min.) and stained with ATR (green), DAPI (blue). The samples were processed for immunofluorescence using anti-ATR (green), DAPI (blue). Hypotonic stress relocalized ATR at certain regions on the NE and in the nucleoli (visualized by anti-TPR Ab and by RFP-Nucleophosmin, respectively) (Figure 3E). Because mechanical signals at the cytoplasmic level can also be experienced in the nucleolus (Hu et al., 2005Hu S.H. Chen J.X. Butler J.P. Wang N.

We did not observe accumulation of γH2AX signals in sorbitol-treated cells, compared to untreated conditions (Figure S3D). However, γH2AX signals increased in cells treated with high NaCl doses (Figure S3D), consistent with previous findings showing that high NaCl causes DNA damage (Kültz and Chakravarty, 2001Kültz D. Chakravarty D. Hyperosmolality in the form of elevated NaCl but not urea causes DNA damage in murine kidney cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Leptomycin-B treatment of cells exposed to hyperosmotic stress did not influence ATR localization at the NE (Figure S3E). ATR activation by DNA damage is influenced by RPA-ssDNA nucleofilaments (Zou and Elledge, 2003Zou L. Elledge S.J. Sensing DNA damage through ATRIP recognition of RPA-ssDNA complexes.Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). We compared ATR and RPA localization, in cells treated with or without sorbitol. RPA32 and ATR exhibited intranuclear staining (Figure 4A). Certain cells undergoing DNA replication (visualized by EdU) exhibited a perinuclear staining of RPA32 (Dimitrova et al., 1999Dimitrova D.S. Todorov I.T. Melendy T. Gilbert D.M.

https://openalex.org/W2086069231,"Proteins destined for the cell surface are first assessed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for proper folding before release into the secretory pathway. This ensures that defective proteins are normally prevented from entering the extracellular environment, where they could be disruptive. Here, we report that, when ER folding capacity is saturated during stress, misfolded glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins dissociate from resident ER chaperones, engage export receptors, and quantitatively leave the ER via vesicular transport to the Golgi. Clearance from the ER commences within minutes of acute ER stress, before the transcriptional component of the unfolded protein response is activated. These aberrant proteins then access the cell surface transiently before destruction in lysosomes. Inhibiting this stress-induced pathway by depleting the ER-export receptors leads to aggregation of the ER-retained misfolded protein. Thus, this rapid response alleviates the elevated burden of misfolded proteins in the ER at the onset of ER stress, promoting protein homeostasis in the ER."

It is not known whether these remarkable molecular machines operate by a stochastic or sequential mechanism or how power strokes relate to the ATP-hydrolysis cycle. Single-molecule optical trapping allows ClpXP unfolding to be directly visualized and reveals translocation steps of ∼1-4 nm in length, but how these activities relate to solution degradation and the physical properties of substrate proteins remains unclear. By studying single-molecule degradation using different multidomain substrates and ClpXP variants, we answer many of these questions and provide evidence for stochastic unfolding and translocation. We also present a mechanochemical model that accounts for single-molecule, biochemical, and structural results for our observation of enzymatic memory in translocation stepping, for the kinetics of translocation steps of different sizes, and for probabilistic but highly coordinated subunit activity within the ClpX ring."
https://openalex.org/W2167652323,"To mount an immune response, T lymphocytes must successfully search for foreign material bound to the surface of antigen-presenting cells. How T cells optimize their chances of encountering and responding to these antigens is unknown. T cell motility in tissues resembles a random or Levy walk and is regulated in part by external factors including chemokines and lymph-node topology, but motility parameters such as speed and propensity to turn may also be cell intrinsic. Here we found that the unconventional myosin 1g (Myo1g) motor generates membrane tension, enforces cell-intrinsic meandering search, and enhances T-DC interactions during lymph-node surveillance. Increased turning and meandering motility, as opposed to ballistic motility, is enhanced by Myo1g. Myo1g acts as a ""turning motor"" and generates a form of cellular ""flânerie."" Modeling and antigen challenges show that these intrinsically programmed elements of motility search are critical for the detection of rare cognate antigen-presenting cells."
https://openalex.org/W1981520304,"Ginsenoside Rb3 is extracted from the plant Panax ginseng and plays important roles in cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. NF-κB is an important transcription factor involved in I/R injury. However, the underlying mechanism of ginsenoside Rb3 in myocardial I/R injury remains poorly understood. In the current study, a model of myocardial I/R injury was induced via oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reperfusion (OGD-Rep) in mouse cardiac myoblast H9c2 cells. Our data demonstrate that ginsenoside Rb3 suppresses OGD-Rep-induced cell apoptosis by the suppression of ROS generation. By detecting the NF-κB signaling pathway, we discover that the protective effect of ginsenoside Rb3 on the OGD-Rep injury is closely related to the inhibition of NF-κB activity. Ginsenoside Rb3 inhibits the upregulation of phospho-IκB-α and nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunit p65 which are induced by ORD-Rep injury. In addition, the extract also inhibits the OGD-Rep-induced increase in the expression of inflammation-related factors, such as IL-6, TNF-α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), MMP-2 and MMP-9. However, LPS treatment alleviates the protective roles of ginsenoside Rb3 and activates the NF-κB pathway. Finally, the upstream factors of NF-κB were analyzed, including the Akt/Foxo3a and MAPK signaling pathways. We find that ginsenoside Rb3 pretreatment only decreases the phosphorylation of JNK induced by OGD-Rep injury, an indicator of the MAPK pathway. Importantly, an inhibitor of phospho-JNK, SP600125, protects against OGD-Rep induced apoptosis and inhibited NF-κB signaling pathway, similar to the roles of ginsenoside Rb3. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the protective effect of ginsenoside Rb3 on the OGD-Rep injury is attributed to the inhibition of JNK-mediated NF-κB activation, suggesting that ginsenoside Rb3 has the potential to serve as a novel therapeutic agent for myocardial I/R injury."
https://openalex.org/W2039813177,"Polarization of the plasma membrane (PM) into domains is an important mechanism to compartmentalize cellular activities and to establish cell polarity. Polarization requires formation of diffusion barriers that prevent mixing of proteins between domains. Recent studies have uncovered that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of budding yeast and neurons is polarized by diffusion barriers, which in neurons controls glutamate signaling in dendritic spines. The molecular identity of these barriers is currently unknown. Here, we show that a direct interaction between the ER protein Scs2 and the septin Shs1 creates the ER diffusion barrier in yeast. Barrier formation requires Epo1, a novel ER-associated subunit of the polarisome that interacts with Scs2 and Shs1. ER-septin tethering polarizes the ER into separate mother and bud domains, one function of which is to position the spindle in the mother until M phase by confining the spindle capture protein Num1 to the mother ER."
https://openalex.org/W2060612775,"A pilot study examined the extent to which eye movements occurring during interpretation of digitized breast biopsy whole slide images (WSI) can distinguish novice interpreters from experts, informing assessments of competency progression during training and across the physician-learning continuum. A pathologist with fellowship training in breast pathology interpreted digital WSI of breast tissue and marked the region of highest diagnostic relevance (dROI). These same images were then evaluated using computer vision techniques to identify visually salient regions of interest (vROI) without diagnostic relevance. A non-invasive eye tracking system recorded pathologists' (N = 7) visual behavior during image interpretation, and we measured differential viewing of vROIs versus dROIs according to their level of expertise. Pathologists with relatively low expertise in interpreting breast pathology were more likely to fixate on, and subsequently return to, diagnostically irrelevant vROIs relative to experts. Repeatedly fixating on the distracting vROI showed limited value in predicting diagnostic failure. These preliminary results suggest that eye movements occurring during digital slide interpretation can characterize expertise development by demonstrating differential attraction to diagnostically relevant versus visually distracting image regions. These results carry both theoretical implications and potential for monitoring and evaluating student progress and providing automated feedback and scanning guidance in educational settings."
https://openalex.org/W2157925019,"In this study, we designed a chitosan/alginate/hydroxyapatite scaffold as a carrier for recombinant BMP-2 (CAH/B2), and evaluated the release kinetics of BMP-2. We evaluated the effect of the CAH/B2 scaffold on the viability and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by scanning electron microscopy, MTS, ALP assay, alizarin-red staining and qRT-PCR. Moreover, MSCs were seeded on scaffolds and used in a 8 mm rat calvarial defect model. New bone formation was assessed by radiology, hematoxylin and eosin staining 12 weeks postoperatively. We found the release kinetics of BMP-2 from the CAH/B2 scaffold were delayed compared with those from collagen gel, which is widely used for BMP-2 delivery. The BMP-2 released from the scaffold increased MSC differentiation and did not show any cytotoxicity. MSCs exhibited greater ALP activity as well as stronger calcium mineral deposition, and the bone-related markers Col1α, osteopontin, and osteocalcin were upregulated. Analysis of in vivo bone formation showed that the CAH/B2 scaffold induced more bone formation than other groups. This study demonstrates that CAH/B2 scaffolds might be useful for delivering osteogenic BMP-2 protein and present a promising bone regeneration strategy."

https://openalex.org/W1978222899,"The malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax is known to be majorly endemic to Asian and Latin American countries with no or very few reports of Africans infected with this parasite. Since the human Duffy antigens act as receptors for P. vivax to invade human RBCs and Africans are generally Duffy-negative, non-endemicity of P. vivax in Africa has been attributed to this fact. However, recent reports describing P. vivax infections in Duffy-negative Africans from West and Central parts of Africa have been surfaced including a recent report on P. vivax infection in native Cameroonians. In order to know if Cameroonians living in the southern regions are also susceptible to P. vivax infection, we collected finger-prick blood samples from 485 malarial symptomatic patients in five locations and followed PCR diagnostic assays with DNA sequencing of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene. Out of the 201 malaria positive cases detected, 193 were pure P. falciparum, six pure P. vivax and two mixed parasite infections (P. falciparum + P. vivax). The eight P. vivax infected samples (six single + two mixed) were further subjected to DNA sequencing of the P. vivax multidrug resistance 1 (pvmdr1) and the P.vivax circumsporozoite (pvcsp) genes. Alignment of the eight Cameroonian pvmdr1 sequences with the reference sequence showed high sequence similarities, reconfirming P. vivax infection in all the eight patients. DNA sequencing of the pvcsp gene indicated all the eight P. vivax to be of VK247 type. Interestingly, DNA sequencing of a part of the human Duffy gene covering the promoter region in the eight P. vivax-infected Cameroonians to identify the T-33C mutation revealed all these patients as Duffy-negative. The results provide evidence of single P. vivax as well as mixed malaria parasite infection in native Cameroonians and add knowledge to the growing evidences of P. vivax infection in Duffy-negative Africans."

Molecular analyses revealed the complexity of the microbiota with the predominance of Lactobacillus and Prevotella in carious dentine lesions. However, characterization of the dentin caries-associated microbiota has not been extensively explored in different ethnicities and races. In the present study, the bacterial communities in the carious dentin of Japanese subjects were analyzed comprehensively with molecular approaches using the16S rRNA gene. Carious dentin lesion samples were collected from 32 subjects aged 4–76 years, and the 16S rRNA genes, amplified from the extracted DNA with universal primers, were sequenced with a pyrosequencer. The bacterial composition was classified into clusters I, II, and III according to the relative abundance (high, middle, low) of Lactobacillus. The bacterial composition in cluster II was composed of relatively high proportions of Olsenella and Propionibacterium or subdominated by heterogeneous genera. The bacterial communities in cluster III were characterized by the predominance of Atopobium, Prevotella, or Propionibacterium with Streptococcus or Actinomyces. Some samples in clusters II and III, mainly related to Atopobium and Propionibacterium, were novel combinations of microbiota in carious dentin lesions and may be characteristic of the Japanese population. Clone library analysis revealed that Atopobium sp. HOT-416 and P. acidifaciens were specific species associated with dentinal caries among these genera in a Japanese population. We summarized the bacterial composition of dentinal carious lesions in a Japanese population using next-generation sequencing and found typical Japanese types with Atopobium or Propionibacterium predominating."

The plasma and urine concentrations of α-klotho were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Plasma α-klotho (572.4 pg/mL [95% CI, 541.9-604.6 pg/mL] vs. 476.9 pg/mL [95% CI, 416.9-545.5 pg/mL]) and urinary α-klotho levels (59.8 pg/mg creatinine [95% CI, 43.6-82.0 pg/mg creatinine] vs. 21.0 pg/mg creatinine [95% CI, 9.7-45.6 pg/mg creatinine]) were significantly higher in diabetic patients than non-diabetic controls. Among diabetic patients, plasma α-klotho concentration was inversely associated with albuminuria stages (normoalbuminuria, 612.6 pg/mL [95% CI, 568.9-659.6 pg/mL], microalbuminuria, 551.8 pg/mL [95% CI, 500.5-608.3 pg/mL], and macroalbuminuria, 505.7 pg/mL [95% CI, 439.7-581.7 pg/mL] (p for trend = 0.0081), while urinary α-klotho levels were remained constantly high with increasing urinary albumin excretion.Soluble α-klotho levels in plasma and urine may be novel and useful early markers of diabetic renal injury."
https://openalex.org/W2004432444,"Objectives Chikungunya virus causes chronic infection with manifestations of joint pain. Human synovial fibroblasts get infected with CHIKV and could lead to pro-inflammatory responses. MicroRNAs have potentials to regulate the gene expression of various anti-viral and pro-inflammatory genes. The study aims to investigate the role of miR-146a in modulation of inflammatory responses of human synovial fibroblasts by Chikungunya virus. Methods To study the role of miR-146a in CHIKV pathogenesis in human synovial cells and underlying inflammatory manifestations, we performed CHIKV infection in primary human synovial fibroblasts. Western blotting, real-time PCR, luciferase reporter assay, overexpression and knockdown of cellular miR-146a strategies have been employed to validate the role of miR-146a in regulation of pro-inflammatory NF-κB pathway. Results CHIKV infection induced the expression of cellular miR-146a, which resulted into down-regulation of TRAF6, IRAK1, IRAK2 and increased replication of CHIKV in human synovial fibroblasts. Exogenous expression of miR-146a in human synovial fibroblasts led to decreased expression of TRAF6, IRAK1, IRAK2 and decreased replication of CHIKV. Inhibition of cellular miR-146a by anti-miR-146a restored the expression levels of TRAF6, IRAK1 and IRAK2. Downregulation of TRAF6, IRAK1 and IRAK2 led to downstream decreased NF-κB activation through negative feedback loop. Conclusion This study demonstrated the mechanism of exploitation of cellular miR-146a by CHIKV in modulating the host antiviral immune response in primary human synovial fibroblasts."

Methods Twelve trained male cyclists/triathletes completed six 20-km exercise trials against the clock in 30.7°C±0.8°C and 78%±0.03% relative humidity. Before and after warm-up, and before exercise and every 5 km during exercise, athletes drank 190 mL of either aromatized (i.e., with 0.5 mL of menthol (5 gr/L)) or a non-aromatized beverage (neutral temperature: 23°C±0.1°C, cold: 3°C±0.1°C, or ice-slush: −1°C±0.7°C). During the trials, heart rate (HR) was continuously monitored, whereas core temperature (Tco), thermal comfort (TC), thermal sensation (TS) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured before and after warm-up, every 5 km of exercise, and at the end of exercise and after recovery. Results Both the beverage aroma (P<0.02) and beverage temperature (P<0.02) had significant and positive effects on performance, which was considerably better with ice-slush than with a neutral temperature beverage, whatever the aroma (P<0.002), and with menthol vs non-menthol (P<0.02). The best performances were obtained with ice-slush/menthol and cold/menthol, as opposed to neutral/menthol. No differences were noted in HR and Tco between trials. Conclusion Cold water or ice-slush with menthol aroma seems to be the most effective beverage for endurance exercise in a tropical climate. Further studies are needed to explore its effects in field competition."
https://openalex.org/W1978818320,"Background Thyroid hormones have a key role in both the developing and adult central nervous system and skeletal muscle. The thyroid gland produces mainly thyroxine (T4) but the intracellular concentrations of 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3; the transcriptionally active hormone) in the central nervous system and skeletal muscle are modulated by the activity of type 2 deiodinase (D2). To date no neurological syndrome has been associated with mutations in the DIO2 gene and previous studies in young and juvenile D2-knockout mice (D2KO) did not find gross neurological alterations, possibly due to compensatory mechanisms. Aim This study aims to analyze the motor phenotype of 3-and-6-month-old D2KO mice to evaluate the role of D2 on the motor system at adult stages in which compensatory mechanisms could have failed. Results Motor abilities were explored by validated tests. In the footprint test, D2KO showed an altered global gait pattern (mice walked slower, with shorter strides and with a hindlimb wider base of support than wild-type mice). No differences were detected in the balance beam test. However, a reduced latency to fall was found in the rotarod, coat-hanger and four limb hanging wire tests indicating impairment on coordination and prehensile reflex and a reduction of muscle strength. In histological analyses of cerebellum and skeletal muscle, D2KO mice did not present gross structural abnormalities. Thyroid hormones levels and deiodinases activities were also determined. In D2KO mice, despite euthyroid T3 and high T4 plasma levels, T3 levels were significantly reduced in cerebral cortex (48% reduction) and skeletal muscle (33% reduction), but not in the cerebellum where other deiodinase (type 1) is expressed. Conclusions The motor alterations observed in D2KO mice indicate an important role for D2 in T3 availability to maintain motor function and muscle strength. Our results suggest a possible implication of D2 in motor disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1978118493,"Human languages are rule governed, but almost invariably these rules have exceptions in the form of irregularities. Since rules in language are efficient and productive, the persistence of irregularity is an anomaly. How does irregularity linger in the face of internal (endogenous) and external (exogenous) pressures to conform to a rule? Here we address this problem by taking a detailed look at simple past tense verbs in the Corpus of Historical American English. The data show that the language is open, with many new verbs entering. At the same time, existing verbs might tend to regularize or irregularize as a consequence of internal dynamics, but overall, the amount of irregularity sustained by the language stays roughly constant over time. Despite continuous vocabulary growth, and presumably, an attendant increase in expressive power, there is no corresponding growth in irregularity. We analyze the set of irregulars, showing they may adhere to a set of minority rules, allowing for increased stability of irregularity over time. These findings contribute to the debate on how language systems become rule governed, and how and why they sustain exceptions to rules, providing insight into the interplay between the emergence and maintenance of rules and exceptions in language."
https://openalex.org/W2001103089,"Coughing plays an important role in influenza transmission; however, there is insufficient information regarding the viral load in cough because of the lack of convenient and reliable collection methods. We developed a portable airborne particle-collection system to measure the viral load; it is equipped with an air sampler to draw air and pass it through a gelatin membrane filter connected to a cone-shaped, megaphone-like device to guide the cough airflow to the membrane. The membrane was dissolved in a medium, and the viral load was measured using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and a plaque assay. The approximate viral recovery rate of this system was 10% in simulation experiments to collect and quantify the viral particles aerosolized by a nebulizer. Using this system, cough samples were collected from 56 influenza A patients. The total viral detection rate was 41% (23/56), and the viral loads varied significantly (from <10, less than the detection limit, to 2240 viral gene copies/cough). Viable viruses were detected from 3 samples with ≤18 plaque forming units per cough sample. The virus detection rates were similar among different groups of patients infected with different viral subtypes and during different influenza seasons. Among patients who did not receive antiviral treatment, viruses were detected in one of six cases in the vaccinated group and four of six cases in the unvaccinated group. We found cases with high viral titers in throat swabs or oral secretions but very low or undetectable in coughs and vice versa suggesting other possible anatomical sites where the viruses might be mixed into the cough. Our system is easy to operate, appropriate for bedside use, and is useful for comparing the viral load in cough samples from influenza patients under various conditions and settings. However, further large-scale studies are warranted to validate our results."
https://openalex.org/W2139481147,"Global surface temperature is predicted to increase by at least 1.5°C by the end of this century. However, the response of soil microbial communities to global warming is still poorly understood, especially in high-elevation grasslands. We therefore conducted an experiment on three types of alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to study the effect of experimental warming on abundance and composition of soil microbial communities at 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths. Plots were passively warmed for 3 years using open-top chambers and compared to adjacent control plots at ambient temperature. Soil microbial communities were assessed using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. We found that 3 years of experimental warming consistently and significantly increased microbial biomass at the 0-10 cm soil depth of alpine swamp meadow (ASM) and alpine steppe (AS) grasslands, and at both the 0-10 and 10-20 cm soil depths of alpine meadow (AM) grasslands, due primarily to the changes in soil temperature, moisture, and plant coverage. Soil microbial community composition was also significantly affected by warming at the 0-10 cm soil depth of ASM and AM and at the 10-20 cm soil depth of AM. Warming significantly decreased the ratio of fungi to bacteria and thus induced a community shift towards bacteria at the 0-10 cm soil depth of ASM and AM. While the ratio of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to saprotrophic fungi (AMF/SF) was significantly decreased by warming at the 0-10 cm soil depth of ASM, it was increased at the 0-10 cm soil depth of AM. These results indicate that warming had a strong influence on soil microbial communities in the studied high-elevation grasslands and that the effect was dependent on grassland type."
https://openalex.org/W1976693938,"Liver ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common pathophysiological process in many clinical settings. Carvacrol, a food additive commonly used in essential oils, has displayed antimicrobials, antitumor and antidepressant-like activities. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of carvacrol on I/R injury in the Wistar rat livers and an in vitro hypoxia/restoration (H/R) model.The hepatoportal vein, hepatic arterial and hepatic duct of Wistar rats were isolated and clamped for 30 min, followed by a 2 h reperfusion. Buffalo rat liver (BRL) cells were incubated under hypoxia for 4 h, followed normoxic conditions for 10 h to establish the H/R model in vitro. Liver injury was evaluated by measuring serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspatate aminotransferase (AST), and hepatic levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and malondiadehyde (MDA), and hepatic histology and TUNEL staining. MTT assay, flow cytometric analysis and Hoechst 33258 staining were used to evaluate the proliferation and apoptosis of BRL cells in vitro. Protein expression was examined by Western Blot analysis.Carvacrol protected against I/R-induced liver damage, evidenced by significantly reducing the serum levels of ALT and AST, histological alterations and apoptosis of liver cells in I/R rats. Carvacrol exhibited anti-oxidative activity in the I/R rats, reflected by significantly reducing the activity of SOD and the content of MDA, and restoring the activity of CAT and the content of GSH, in I/R rats. In the in vitro assays, carvacrol restored the viability and inhibited the apoptosis of BRL cells, which were subjected to a mimic I/R injury induced by hypoxia. In the investigation on molecular mechanisms, carvacrol downregulated the expression of Bax and upregulated the expression of Bcl-2, thus inhibited the activation of caspase-3. Carvacrol was also shown to enhance the phosphorylation of Akt.The results suggest that carvacrol could alleviate I/R-induced liver injury by its anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic activities, and warrant a further investigation for using carvacrol to protect I/R injury in clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2080178057,"The development of early B cells, which are generated from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in a series of well-characterized stages in bone marrow (BM), represents a paradigm for terminal differentiation processes. Akt is primarily regulated by phosphorylation at Thr308 by PDK1 and at Ser473 by mTORC2, and Akt signaling plays a key role in hematopoiesis. However, the role of mTORC2 in the development of early B cells remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the functional role of mTORC2 by specifically deleting an integral component, Rictor, in a hematopoietic system. We demonstrated that the deletion of Rictor induced an aberrant increase in the FoxO1 and Rag-1 proteins in BM B cells and that this increase was accompanied by a significant decrease in the abundance of B cells in the peripheral blood (PB) and the spleen, suggesting impaired development of early B cells in adult mouse BM. A BM transplantation assay revealed that the B cell differentiation defect induced by Rictor deletion was not affected by the BM microenvironment, thus indicating a cell-intrinsic mechanism. Furthermore, the knockdown of FoxO1 in Rictor-deleted HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) promoted the maturation of B cells in the BM of recipient mice. In addition, we revealed that treatment with rapamycin (an mTORC1 inhibitor) aggravated the deficiency in B cell development in the PB and BM. Taken together, our results provide further evidence that Rictor regulates the development of early B cells in a cell-intrinsic manner by modifying the expression of FoxO1 and Rag-1."
https://openalex.org/W2008222142,"To develop and validate a Chinese version of the Catquest-9SF questionnaire in a cataract population.The Catquest-9SF Questionnaire was translated and back translated into Chinese. Preoperative patients were recruited at a tertiary eye hospital and their demographic information and visual acuity were documented. Psychometric properties of the Catquest-9SF, including ordered thresholds, the ability to distinguish between different strata of person ability, absence of misfitting items, unidimentionality, differential item functioning (DIF) and construct validity were tested, using Rasch analysis.A total of 102 patients (100% response rate) were enrolled. The participants'mean age was 70.2 year (SD = 12.1) and 46.9% were female. Rasch analysis showed that this version of the questionnaire had ordered response thresholds and was free of DIF. The items fit a single overall construct and unidimensional by principal components analysis of the residuals. Patients with visual impairment had significantly poorer Rasch scores on the Catquest-9SF (mean change, -2.5, p = 0.035, compared with non-visually impaired patients).The Chinese version of Catquest-9SF is a valid and reliable questionnaire for assessing the visual disability outcomes of Chinese patients with cataract, and it may be recommended for routine clinical use."

https://openalex.org/W2026491871,"Glioblastoma (GBM) heterogeneity in the genomic and phenotypic properties has potentiated personalized approach against specific therapeutic targets of each GBM patient. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network has been established the comprehensive genomic abnormalities of GBM, which sub-classified GBMs into 4 different molecular subtypes. The molecular subtypes could be utilized to develop personalized treatment strategy for each subtype. We applied a classifying method, NTP (Nearest Template Prediction) method to determine molecular subtype of each GBM patient and corresponding orthotopic xenograft animal model. The models were derived from GBM cells dissociated from patient's surgical sample. Specific drug candidates for each subtype were selected using an integrated pharmacological network database (PharmDB), which link drugs with subtype specific genes. Treatment effects of the drug candidates were determined by in vitro limiting dilution assay using patient-derived GBM cells primarily cultured from orthotopic xenograft tumors. The consistent identification of molecular subtype by the NTP method was validated using TCGA database. When subtypes were determined by the NTP method, orthotopic xenograft animal models faithfully maintained the molecular subtypes of parental tumors. Subtype specific drugs not only showed significant inhibition effects on the in vitro clonogenicity of patient-derived GBM cells but also synergistically reversed temozolomide resistance of MGMT-unmethylated patient-derived GBM cells. However, inhibitory effects on the clonogenicity were not totally subtype-specific. Personalized treatment approach based on genetic characteristics of each GBM could make better treatment outcomes of GBMs, although more sophisticated classifying techniques and subtype specific drugs need to be further elucidated."

As impaired vascular health is a common finding in patients suffering from severe periodontal disease a concomitant routine cardiovascular evaluation may be advised."
https://openalex.org/W2068851797,"Kisspeptin (KP)- and neurokinin B (NKB)- synthesizing neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus play a pivotal role in the regulation of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion. Unlike in rodents and sheep, the homologous KP and NKB neurons in the human infundibular region rarely express dynorphin- but often exhibit Substance P (SP) immunoreactivity, indicating remarkable species differences in the neurochemical phenotype of these neurons. In search for additional neuropeptides in human KP and NKB neurons, we carried out immunofluorescent studies on hypothalamic sections obtained from five postmenopausal women. Colocalization experiments provided evidence for the presence of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) in 47.9 ± 6.6% of KP-immunoreactive (IR) and 30.0 ± 4.9% of NKB-IR perikarya and in 17.0 ± 2.3% of KP-IR and 6.2 ± 2.0% of NKB-IR axon varicosities. All three neuropeptides were present in 33.3 ± 4.9% of KP-IR and 28.2 ± 4.6% of NKB-IR somata, respectively, whereas triple-labeling showed lower incidences in KP-IR (14.3 ± 1.8%) and NKB-IR (5.9 ± 2.0%) axon varicosities. CART-IR KP and NKB neurons established contacts with other peptidergic cells, including GnRH-IR neurons and also sent projections to the infundibular stalk. KP and NKB fibers with CART often contained SP as well, while being distinct from CART fibers co-containing the orexigenic peptide agouti-related protein. Presence of CART in human, but not rodent, KP and NKB neurons represents a new example of species differences in the neuropeptide repertoire of mediobasal hypothalamic KP and NKB neurons. Target cells, receptor sites and physiological significance of CART in the efferent communication of KP and NKB neurons in primates require clarification."
https://openalex.org/W2123719103,"Risk preferences drive much of human decision making including investment, career and health choices and many more. Thus, understanding the determinants of risk preferences refines our understanding of choice in a broad array of environments. We assess the relationship between risk preferences, prenatal exposure to sex hormones and gender for a sample of Ladinos, which is an ethnic group comprising 62.86% of the population of Guatemala. Prenatal exposure to sex hormones has organizational effects on brain development, and has been shown to partially explain risk preferences for Caucasians. We measure prenatal exposure to sex hormones using the ratio of the length of the index finger to the length of the ring finger (2D:4D), which is negatively (positively) correlated with prenatal exposure to testosterone (estrogen). We find that Ladino males are less risk averse than Ladino females, and that Ladino males have lower 2D:4D ratios than Ladino females on both hands. We find that the 2D:4D ratio does not explain risk preferences for Ladinos. This is true for both genders, and both hands. Our results highlight the importance of exploring the behavioral significance of 2D:4D in non-Caucasian racial groups."
https://openalex.org/W2157758507,"Adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) is a key virulence factor of the whooping cough agent Bordetella pertussis. The toxin targets CD11b-expressing phagocytes and delivers into their cytosol an adenylyl cyclase (AC) enzyme that subverts cellular signaling by increasing cAMP levels. In the present study, we analyzed the modulatory effects of CyaA on adhesive, migratory and antigen presenting properties of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-activated murine and human dendritic cells (DCs). cAMP signaling of CyaA enhanced TLR-induced dissolution of cell adhesive contacts and migration of DCs towards the lymph node-homing chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 in vitro. Moreover, we examined in detail the capacity of toxin-treated DCs to induce CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses. Exposure to CyaA decreased the capacity of LPS-stimulated DCs to present soluble protein antigen to CD4+ T cells independently of modulation of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokine production, and enhanced their capacity to promote CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells in vitro. In addition, CyaA decreased the capacity of LPS-stimulated DCs to induce CD8(+) T cell proliferation and limited the induction of IFN-γ producing CD8(+) T cells while enhancing IL-10 and IL-17-production. These results indicate that through activation of cAMP signaling, the CyaA may be mobilizing DCs impaired in T cell stimulatory capacity and arrival of such DCs into draining lymph nodes may than contribute to delay and subversion of host immune responses during B. pertussis infection."
https://openalex.org/W1972399459,"The aim of this study was to explore the role of SecDF in protein secretion in Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 by in-depth characterization of a markerless secDF knock out mutant. Deletion of secDF resulted in pleiotropic effects characterized by a moderately slower growth rate, aberrant cell morphology, enhanced susceptibility to xenobiotics, reduced virulence and motility. Most toxins, including food poisoning-associated enterotoxins Nhe, Hbl, and cytotoxin K, as well as phospholipase C were less abundant in the secretome of the ΔsecDF mutant as determined by label-free mass spectrometry. Global transcriptome studies revealed profound transcriptional changes upon deletion of secDF indicating cell envelope stress. Interestingly, the addition of glucose enhanced the described phenotypes. This study shows that SecDF is an important part of the Sec-translocase mediating efficient secretion of virulence factors in the Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen B. cereus, and further supports the notion that B. cereus enterotoxins are secreted by the Sec-system."
https://openalex.org/W2093517839,"Background Sodas are widely sold in vending machines and other school venues in the United States, particularly in high school. Research suggests that policy changes have reduced soda access, but the impact of reduced access on consumption is unclear. This study was designed to identify student, environmental, or policy characteristics that modify the associations between school vending machines and student dietary behaviors. Methods Data on school vending machine access and student diet were obtained as part of the National Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Study (NYPANS) and linked to state-level data on soda taxes, restaurant taxes, and state laws governing the sale of soda in schools. Regression models were used to: 1) estimate associations between vending machine access and soda consumption, fast food consumption, and lunch source, and 2) determine if associations were modified by state soda taxes, restaurant taxes, laws banning in-school soda sales, or student characteristics (race/ethnicity, sex, home food access, weight loss behaviors.) Results Contrary to the hypothesis, students tended to consume 0.53 fewer servings of soda/week (95% CI: -1.17, 0.11) and consume fast food on 0.24 fewer days/week (95% CI: -0.44, -0.05) if they had in-school access to vending machines. They were also less likely to consume soda daily (23.9% vs. 27.9%, average difference = -4.02, 95% CI: -7.28, -0.76). However, these inverse associations were observed primarily among states with lower soda and restaurant tax rates (relative to general food tax rates) and states that did not ban in-school soda sales. Associations did not vary by any student characteristics except for weight loss behaviors. Conclusion Isolated changes to the school food environment may have unintended consequences unless policymakers incorporate other initiatives designed to discourage overall soda consumption."
https://openalex.org/W1978667789,"Background The epigenetic mechanism of tumorigenesis in pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) remains largely unknown. The aim of this study is to examine the role of enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) alteration in pancreatic IPMN progression. Methods Fifty-four surgically resected pancreatic IPMN specimens, including a total of 181 lesions (normal duct in 48, adenoma in 50, borderline atypia in 53, carcinoma in situ (CIS) in 19, and invasive carcinoma in 11) were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining (EZH2, Ki-67, p27Kip1). Using paraffin embedded sections, total RNA was successfully extracted from 20 IPMN lesions (borderline IPMN in 9, CIS in 6, invasive carcinoma in 5) and 7 pancreatic normal ducts, and then levels of EZH2 and p27Kip1 mRNA were analyzed by real time PCR. Results In immunohistochemical analysis, cell proliferative activity revealed by Ki-67 positive nuclei was increased during IPMN progression (normal duct<adenoma<borderline atypia<CIS ≈ invasive carcinoma). EZH2 expression displayed a similar pattern (normal duct<adenoma<borderline atypia<CIS ≈ invasive carcinoma) with cell proliferative activity. EZH2 expression in malignant (CIS and invasive carcinoma) IPMNs was significantly higher than that in adenoma and borderline-atypia IPMNs. EZH2 expression level in IPMN lesions was positively correlated with the Ki-67 positive nuclear ratio (p<0.0001). EZH2-positive cells in malignant IPMN did not express p27Kip1. EZH2 mRNA expressions in malignant lesions were significantly higher than those in benign lesions (p<0.0001). In contrast, p27Kip1 mRNA in malignant lesions was significantly decreased compared to those in benign lesion (p<0.05), and there was an inverse correlation between EZH2 and p27Kip1 mRNA levels (p = 0.0109). Conclusion EZH2 is associated with the accelerated cell proliferation and malignant step in pancreatic IPMN via the downregulation of p27Kip1."
https://openalex.org/W2084183390,"High mortality in pregnant women (PR) is a characteristic of hepatitis E in developing countries. To understand the pathogenesis of HEV infection in self-limiting disease during pregnancy, we compared clinical (PR-patients) and subclinical-HEV-infections in pregnant women in the first (SC-PR-1) and later (2nd and 3rd, SC-PR-2+3) trimesters with the respective healthy controls and acute non-PR patients. The SC-PR-2+3 exhibited lower ALT, bilirubin levels, anti-HEV-IgM/IgG titres than the acute-PR/non-PR-patients (p<0.05–0.0001). IFNγ/IL4ratios indicated Th2/Th1 bias in non-PR and PR-patients respectively. Raised levels of 10/20 plasma cytokines in the non-PR-patients reflect predominant inflammatory response, unaltered- IFNγ/reduced-IFNα responses and a robust chemokine secretion. On contrary, the acute-PR-patients exhibited drastic reduction in majority of the cytokines relative to in the non-PR-patients. Importantly, diminished or unaltered response was noted in the acute-PR-group when compared to the corresponding controls. The only exception was sIL2RA, increasing in both patient categories. Of the 14 genes evaluated, the expression of IFNγ/IL10/IL1A/IL7/CCL2/CCL3/CXCL8/CXCL10 was higher in the non-PR patients. Of these, the expression of IFNγ/IL10/IL1A/CCL2/CCL3/CXCL8 and, additionally, IL2/IL6/TNF genes was higher in the clinical-PRs. Almost identical pattern was noted in the control-PR-2+3 category indicating no influence of HEV infection. Comparison of patient-categories identified significant elevation of IFNγ(P<0.001), CCL2(p<0.01), CXCL8(P<0.05), IL1B(p<0.05) and IL10(P<0.0001) and decrease in CXCL10(<0.05) in the PR-patients. The results suggest antibody-dependent disease severity and impaired immune response in the PR patients. Higher expression of cytokine-genes in the PBMCs did not correlate with the plasma-cytokine levels in the PR-patients."
https://openalex.org/W2101362761,"Endometriosis is a complex gynecological condition that affects 6–10% of women in their reproductive years and is defined by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus. Twin, family, and genome-wide association (GWA) studies have confirmed a genetic role, yet only a small part of the genetic risk can be explained by SNP variation. Copy number variants (CNVs) account for a greater portion of human genetic variation than SNPs and include more recent mutations of large effect. CNVs, likely to be prominent in conditions with decreased reproductive fitness, have not previously been examined as a genetic contributor to endometriosis. Here we employ a high-density genotyping microarray in a genome-wide survey of CNVs in a case-control population that includes 2,126 surgically confirmed endometriosis cases and 17,974 population controls of European ancestry. We apply stringent quality filters to reduce the false positive rate common to many CNV-detection algorithms from 77.7% to 7.3% without noticeable reduction in the true positive rate. We detected no differences in the CNV landscape between cases and controls on the global level which showed an average of 1.92 CNVs per individual with an average size of 142.3 kb. On the local level we identify 22 CNV-regions at the nominal significance threshold (P<0.05), which is greater than the 8.15 CNV-regions expected based on permutation analysis (P<0.001). Three CNV's passed a genome-wide P-value threshold of 9.3×10−4; a deletion at SGCZ on 8p22 (P = 7.3×10−4, OR = 8.5, Cl = 2.3–31.7), a deletion in MALRD1 on 10p12.31 (P = 5.6×10−4, OR = 14.1, Cl = 2.7–90.9), and a deletion at 11q14.1 (P = 5.7×10−4, OR = 33.8, Cl = 3.3–1651). Two SNPs within the 22 CNVRs show significant genotypic association with endometriosis after adjusting for multiple testing; rs758316 in DPP6 on 7q36.2 (P = 0.0045) and rs4837864 in ASTN2 on 9q33.1 (P = 0.0002).

https://openalex.org/W1980474919,"To assess the impact of mental health visits (MHV) on the cost of care for Veterans with diabetes and comorbid mental health conditions.A national cohort of 120,852 Veterans with diabetes and at least one mental health diagnosis (i.e., substance abuse, depression or psychoses) in 2002 was followed through 2006. Outcomes were pharmacy, inpatient and outpatient costs in 2012 dollars.Least-square covariate adjusted estimates from the joint model of total VA costs of the number of MHV using December 31, 2012 value dollars indicate that relative to those with fewer MHV, those with 3+ MHV had the lowest mean inpatient cost ($21,406), but the highest mean outpatient and pharmacy cost ($9,727 and $2,015, respectively). If all Veterans who received zero MHV actually received 3+ MHV, we estimate through simulated scenarios that between $32,272,329 and $181,460,247 in inpatient costs would be saved. However, these savings would be offset by additional expenditures of between $1,166,017,547 and $1,166,224,787 in outpatient costs and between $151,604,683 and $161,439,632 in pharmacy costs.Among Veterans with diabetes and comorbid mental disorders having three or more mental health visits is associated with marginally decreased inpatient cost, but these potential savings seem to be offset by increased outpatient and pharmacy costs."
https://openalex.org/W2058032781,"It is widely recognized that propagation of electrophysiological signals between the soma and dendrites of neurons differs depending on direction, i.e. it is asymmetric. How this asymmetry influences the activation of voltage-gated dendritic channels, and consequent neuronal behavior, remains unclear. Based on the analysis of asymmetry in several types of motoneurons, we extended our previous methodology for reducing a fully reconstructed motoneuron model to a two-compartment representation that preserved asymmetric signal propagation. The reduced models accurately replicated the dendritic excitability and the dynamics of the anatomical model involving a persistent inward current (PIC) dispersed over the dendrites. The relationship between asymmetric signal propagation and dendritic excitability was investigated using the reduced models while varying the asymmetry in signal propagation between the soma and the dendrite with PIC density constant. We found that increases in signal attenuation from soma to dendrites increased the activation threshold of a PIC (hypo-excitability), whereas increases in signal attenuation from dendrites to soma decreased the activation threshold of a PIC (hyper-excitability). These effects were so strong that reversing the asymmetry in the soma-to-dendrite vs. dendrite-to-soma attenuation, reversed the correlation between PIC threshold and distance of this current source from the soma. We propose the tight relation of the asymmetric signal propagation to the input resistance in the dendrites as a mechanism underlying the influence of the asymmetric signal propagation on the dendritic excitability. All these results emphasize the importance of maintaining the physiological asymmetry in dendritic signaling not only for normal function of the cells but also for biophysically realistic simulations of dendritic excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2066579354,"Brain lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis may lead to abnormal excitability of brainstem reflex circuits because of impairment of descending control pathways. We hypothesized that such abnormality should show in the analysis of blink reflex responses in the form of asymmetries in response size. The study was done in 20 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and 12 matched healthy subjects. We identified first patients with latency abnormalities (AbLat). Then, we analyzed response size by calculating the R2c/R2 ratio to stimulation of either side and the mean area of the R2 responses obtained in the same side. Patients with significantly larger response size with respect to healthy subjects in at least one side were considered to have abnormal response excitability (AbEx). We also examined the blink reflex excitability recovery (BRER) and prepulse inhibition (BRIP) of either side in search for additional indices of asymmetry in response excitability. Neurophysiological data were correlated with MRI-determined brain lesion-load and volume. Eight patients were identified as AbLat (median Expanded Disability Status Scale–EDSS = 2.75) and 7 of them had ponto-medullary lesions. Nine patients were identified as AbEx (EDSS = 1.5) and only 2 of them, who also were AbLat, had ponto-medullary lesions. In AbEx patients, the abnormalities in response size were confined to one side, with a similar tendency in most variables (significantly asymmetric R1 amplitude, BRER index and BRIP percentage). AbEx patients had asymmetric distribution of hemispheral lesions, in contrast with the symmetric pattern observed in AbLat. The brainstem lesion load was significantly lower in AbEx than in AbLat patients (p = 0.04). Asymmetric abnormalities in blink reflex response excitability in patients with multiple sclerosis are associated with lesser disability and lower tissue loss than abnormalities in response latency. Testing response excitability could provide a reliable neurophysiological index of dysfunction in early stages of multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2085477878,"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the influence of very low ambient illumination and complete darkness on the postural sway of young and elderly adults. Eighteen healthy young participants aged 23.8 ± 1.5 years and 26 community-dwelling elderly aged 69.8 ± 5.6 years were studied. Each participant performed four tests while standing on a force platform in the following conditions: in normal light (215 lx) with open eyes and with closed eyes, in very low illumination (0.25 lx) with open eyes, and in complete darkness with open eyes. The sequences of the tests in the altered visual conditions were determined by random blocs. Postural sway was assessed by means of the force platform measurements. The centre of pressure variables: the medio-lateral and antero-posterior path lengths, mean velocities, sway areas, and fractal dimensions were analysed. Very low illumination resulted in a statistically significant increase in postural sway in both the young and elderly groups compared to normal light, although the increase was significantly smaller than those observed in the eyes closed and complete darkness condition, and no significant effects of illumination on fractal dimensions were detected. The gains of the sways in the very low or no illumination conditions relative to the normal light condition were significantly larger in the group of young participants than in the group of elderly participants (up to 50% and 25%, respectively). However, the response patterns to changes in illumination were similar in the young and elderly participants, with the exception of the short-range fractal dimension of the medio-lateral sway. In conclusion, very low illumination resulted in increased postural sway compared to normal illumination; however, in the closed eye and complete darkness conditions, postural sway was significantly higher than in the very low illumination condition regardless of the age of the participants."
https://openalex.org/W1990389306,"Drosophila melanogaster flies mount an impressive immune response to a variety of pathogens with an efficient system comprised of both humoral and cellular responses. The fat body is the main producer of the anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) with anti-pathogen activity. During bacterial infection, an array of secreted peptidases, proteases and other enzymes are involved in the dissolution of debris generated by pathogen clearance. Although pathogen destruction should result in the release a large amount of nucleic acids, the mechanisms for its removal are still not known. In this report, we present the characterization of a nuclease gene that is induced not only by bacterial infection but also by oxidative stress. Expression of the identified protein has revealed that it encodes a potent nuclease that has been named Stress Induced DNase (SID). SID belongs to a family of evolutionarily conserved cation-dependent nucleases that degrade both single and double-stranded nucleic acids. Down-regulation of sid expression via RNA interference leads to significant reduction of fly viability after bacterial infection and oxidative stress. Our results indicate that SID protects flies from the toxic effects of excess DNA/RNA released by pathogen destruction and from oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W2021001209,"Myotonia congenita is a human muscle disorder caused by mutations in CLCN1, which encodes human chloride channel 1 (CLCN1). Zebrafish is becoming an increasingly useful model for human diseases, including muscle disorders. In this study, we generated transgenic zebrafish expressing, under the control of a muscle specific promoter, human CLCN1 carrying mutations that have been identified in human patients suffering from myotonia congenita. We developed video analytic tools that are able to provide precise quantitative measurements of movement abnormalities in order to analyse the effect of these CLCN1 mutations on adult transgenic zebrafish swimming. Two new parameters for body-wave kinematics of swimming reveal changes in body curvature and tail offset in transgenic zebrafish expressing the disease-associated CLCN1 mutants, presumably due to their effect on muscle function. The capability of the developed video analytic tool to distinguish wild-type from transgenic zebrafish could provide a useful asset to screen for compounds that reverse the disease phenotype, and may be applicable to other movement disorders besides myotonia congenita."
https://openalex.org/W2321340503,"Melanin concentrating hormone (MCH), a neuropeptide produced mainly in neurons localized to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), has been implicated in the regulation of food intake, energy balance, sleep state, and the cardiovascular system. Hypothalamic MCH neurons also have multisynaptic connections with diaphragmatic motoneurons and project to many central chemoreceptor sites. However, there are few studies of MCH involvement in central respiratory control. To test the hypothesis that MCH plays a role in the central chemoreflex, we induced a down regulation of MCH in the central nervous system by knocking down the MCH precursor (pMCH) mRNA in the LHA using a pool of small interfering RNA (siRNA), and measured the resultant changes in breathing, metabolic rate, body weight, and blood glucose levels in conscious rats. The injections of pMCH-siRNA into the LHA successfully produced a ∼62% reduction of pMCH mRNA expression in the LHA and a ∼43% decrease of MCH levels in the cerebrospinal fluid relative to scrambled-siRNA treatment (P = 0.006 and P = 0.02 respectively). Compared to the pretreatment baseline and the scrambled-siRNA treated control rats, knockdown of MCH resulted in: 1) an enhanced hypercapnic chemoreflex (∼42 & 47% respectively; P < 0.05) only in wakefulness; 2) a decrease in body weight and basal glucose levels; and 3) an unchanged metabolic rate. Our results indicate that MCH participates not only in the regulation of glucose and sleep-wake homeostasis but also the vigilance-state dependent regulation of the central hypercapnic chemoreflex and respiratory control."
https://openalex.org/W1974947208,"Our aim was to investigate whether guinea pig urothelium-derived bioactivities compatible with the existence of urothelium-derived inhibitory factor could be demonstrated by in vitro serial bioassay and whether purinergic P1 receptor agonists, nitric oxide, nitrite or prostaglandins might explain observed activities. In a cascade superfusion system, urothelium-denuded guinea pig ureters were used as bioassay tissues, recording their spontaneous rhythmic contractions in presence of scopolamine. Urothelium-intact or -denuded guinea pig urinary bladders were used as donor tissues, stimulated by intermittent application of carbachol before or during the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), the adenosine/P1 nucleoside receptor antagonist 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (8-PST) or the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor diclofenac infused to bath donor and bioassay tissues. The spontaneous contractions of bioassay ureters were unaltered by application of carbachol 1–5 µM in the presence of scopolamine 5–30 µM. When carbachol was applied over the urothelium-denuded bladder, the assay ureter contraction rate was unaltered. Introducing carbachol over the everted urothelium-intact bladder significantly inhibited the contraction frequency of the assay ureter, suggesting the transfer of an inhibitory activity from the bladder to the assay ureter. The transmissible inhibitory activity was not markedly antagonized by L-NAME, 8-PST or diclofenac, while L-NAME nearly abolished nitrite release from the urothelium-intact bladder preparations. We suggest that urothelium-derived inhibitory factor is a transmissible entity over a significant distance as demonstrated in this novel cascade superfusion assay and seems less likely to be nitric oxide, nitrite, an adenosine receptor agonist or subject to inhibition by administration of a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2037942177,"Cereal Brittle1 protein has been demonstrated to be involved in the ADP-Glc transport into endosperm plastids, and plays vital roles in the biosynthesis of starch. In this study, the genomic sequences of the ZmBT1 gene in 80 elite maize inbred lines were obtained, and the nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype diversity were detected. A total of 30 variants, including 22 SNPs and 8 indels, were detected from the full sequences of this gene. Among these polymorphic sites, 9 SNPs and 2 indels were found to be located in the coding region. The polymorphisms of CDS sequences classified the maize ZmBT1 gene into 6 haplotypes, which encode 6 different ZmBT1 proteins. Neutrality tests revealed a decrease in population size and/or balancing selection on the maize ZmBT1 locus. To detect the association between sequence variations of this gene and the starch physicochemical properties, 7 pasting and 4 gelatinization traits of starch were measured for the tested inbred lines using rapid visco analyzer (RVA) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), respectively. The result of association analysis revealed that an indel in the coding region was significantly associated with the phenotypic variation of starch gelatinization enthalpy."
https://openalex.org/W2060024754,"The epididymis has an important role in the maturation of sperm for fertilization, but little is known about the epididymal molecules involved in sperm modifications during this process. We have previously described the expression pattern for an antigen in epididymal epithelial cells that reacts with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) TRA 54. Immunohistochemical and immunoblotting analyses suggest that the epitope of the epididymal antigen probably involves a sugar moiety that is released into the epididymal lumen in an androgen-dependent manner and subsequently binds to luminal sperm. Using column chromatography, SDS-PAGE with in situ digestion and mass spectrometry, we have identified the protein recognized by mAb TRA 54 in mouse epididymal epithelial cells. The ∼65 kDa protein is part of a high molecular mass complex (∼260 kDa) that is also present in the sperm acrosomal vesicle and is completely released after the acrosomal reaction. The amino acid sequence of the protein corresponded to that of albumin. Immunoprecipitates with anti-albumin antibody contained the antigen recognized by mAb TRA 54, indicating that the epididymal molecule recognized by mAb TRA 54 is albumin. RT-PCR detected albumin mRNA in the epididymis and fertilization assays in vitro showed that the glycoprotein complex containing albumin was involved in the ability of sperm to recognize and penetrate the egg zona pellucida. Together, these results indicate that epididymal-derived albumin participates in the formation of a high molecular mass glycoprotein complex that has an important role in egg fertilization."

Interleukin-1/Toll-like receptor (IL-1/TLR) signaling is involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, but whether and how the IL-1/TLR-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway plays key roles in intimal formation is unclear. The underlying mechanism of intima hyperplasia was investigated with a model of carotid balloon injury in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) and Wistar rats and with lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. Elastic-van Gieson staining showed the medial area peakedon Day 3 post-injury and decreased by Day 7 post-injury in both GK and Wistar rats. The N/M at Day 7 in GK rats was significantly higher than in Wistar rats (p<0.001). The percent of 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining-positive cells on Day 3 post-injury was greater than seen on Day 7 post-injury in GK and Wistar rats. The percent of EdU-positive cells on Days 3 and 7 post-injury in Wistar rats was less than that found in GK rats (p<0.01; p<0.05). NFκBp65 immunostaining had increased by Day 7 post-injury. Agilent Whole Genome Oligo Microarray verified that the IL-1/TLR-induced NFκB pathway was activated by carotid balloon injury. TLR4, IL-1 receptor associated kinase, inhibitors α of NFκB, human antigen R, c-Myc (Proto-Oncogene Proteins), EGF-like module-containing mucin-like hormone receptor-like 1 and Interleukin-6 were up-regulated or down-regulated according to immunochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting and Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Overall, we conclude that the IL-1/TLR-induced NFκB pathway participates in the intimal hyperplasia after carotid injury in GK and Wistar rats and that GK rats respond more intensely to the inflammation than Wistar rats."
