https://openalex.org/W2009467948,"The sterol binding agent 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin is shown to be a convenient and useful experimental tool to probe intracellular pathways of cholesterol transport. Biochemical and cytochemical studies reveal that cyclodextrin specifically removes plasma membrane cholesterol. Depletion of plasma membrane sphingomyelin greatly accelerated cyclodextrin-mediated cholesterol removal. Cholesterol arriving at the plasma membrane from lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum was also removed by cyclodextrin. Cellular cholesterol esterification linked to the mobilization of cholesterol from lysosomes was strongly attenuated by cyclodextrin, suggesting that the major portion of endocytosed cholesterol is delivered from lysosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum via the plasma membrane. Evidence for translocation of lysosomal cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum by a plasma membrane-independent pathway is provided by the finding that cyclodextrin loses its ability to suppress esterification when plasma membrane sphingomyelin is depleted. The Golgi apparatus appears to play an active role in directing the relocation of lysosomal cholesterol to the plasma membrane since brefeldin A also abrogated cyclodextrin-mediated suppression of cholesterol esterification. Using cyclodextrin we further show that attenuated esterification of lysosomal cholesterol in Niemann-Pick C cells reflects defective translocation of cholesterol to the plasma membrane that may be linked to abnormal Golgi trafficking.

Cholesterol is an integral membrane component required for normal cellular function (1Bloch K. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1991: 363Google Scholar). In mammalian cells this sterol is derived either from low density lipoprotein (LDL) 1The abbreviations used are: LDLlow density lipoproteinBFAbrefeldin ACD2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrinERendoplasmic reticulumHDLhigh density lipoproteinHMheavy membrane fractionLMlight membrane fractionLPDSlipoprotein-deficient serumNP-CNiemann-Pick type CPMplasma membraneSMsphingomyelinSMaseneutral sphingomyelinasePBSphosphate-buffered saline. following receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequent hydrolysis in lysosomes (2Brown M.S.

Chem. 1987; 262: 9649-9655Google Scholar). The mechanism for the ensuing movement of cholesterol from these intracellular sites to their ultimate cellular destinations is an unresolved question of fundamental importance to cell biology and medicine. Defects in these transport pathways can alter cellular cholesterol metabolism resulting in pathological states. Niemann-Pick C (NP-C) disease is characterized by sequestration of LDL-derived cholesterol in lysosomes that is linked to delays in the induction of cholesterol-mediated homeostatic responses (4Pentchev P.G. Comly M.E. Kruth H.S. Tokoro T. Butler J. Sokol J. Filling- Katz M. Quirk J.M. Marshall D.C. Patel S. Vanier M.T. Brady R.O. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 40-45Google Scholar, 5Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17002-17008Google Scholar). Development of atherosclerotic lesions involves in part a failure to maintain adequate transfer of cholesterol from intracellular sites of accumulation to the cell surface for removal by extracellular acceptors (6Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-298Google Scholar). Understanding pathways of intracellular cholesterol transport is a critical step toward the correction of cellular cholesterol lipidoses. low density lipoprotein brefeldin A 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin endoplasmic reticulum high density lipoprotein heavy membrane fraction light membrane fraction lipoprotein-deficient serum Niemann-Pick type C plasma membrane sphingomyelin neutral sphingomyelinase phosphate-buffered saline. The intracellular distribution of cholesterol generated by these transport pathways is not uniform, with a major fraction present in the plasma membrane (PM) (7Lange Y. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 329-339Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this high concentration of cholesterol at the cell surface results in part from its close association with sphingomyelin (SM) (8Wattenberg B.W. Silbert D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2284-2289Google Scholar). Enzymatic digestion of SM by exogenously added sphingomyelinase (SMase) mobilizes PM cholesterol for esterification in the ER (9Slotte J.P. Bierman E.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 653-658Google Scholar, 10Slotte J.P. Hedstrom G. Rannstrom S. Ekman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 90-96Google Scholar, 11Chatterjee S. J. Biol.

Several methods have been employed to monitor intracellular movement of cholesterol. Arrival of cholesterol at the ER is accompanied by esterification catalyzed by the resident enzyme acetyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase. Transfer of cholesterol to the PM has been studied by subcellular fractionation (13DeGrella R.F. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14256-14262Google Scholar), chemical modification by exogenously added cholesterol oxidase (14Lange Y. Ramos B.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15130-15134Google Scholar), or via removal from the cell surface to extracellular cholesterol acceptors (15Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Google Scholar, 16Rothblat G.H. Bamberger M. Phillips M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 628-644Google Scholar). This latter approach has been limited by the lack of an acceptor that efficiently removes cholesterol. The effectiveness of cholesterol depletion from the PM by HDL varies with cell type and is neither an extensive nor a rapid process (16Rothblat G.H. Bamberger M. Phillips M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 628-644Google Scholar, 17Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4541-4550Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate the utility of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD), as an effective extracellular cholesterol acceptor, to monitor the flux of cholesterol through the PM of living cells. Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligomers of glucose that have the capacity to sequester lipophiles in their hydrophobic core (18Szetli J. Cyclodextrin Technology. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1988: 79Google Scholar). The water-soluble cyclodextrins preferentially form inclusion complexes with sterols thereby greatly enhancing their solubility in aqueous solution (19Pitha J. Irie T. Sklar P.B. Nye J.S. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 493-502Google Scholar, 20Irie T. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 81: 521-523Google Scholar, 21Gerloczy A. Hishino T. Pitha J. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 83: 193-196Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that CD is capable of stimulating cholesterol efflux from cultured cells with very high efficiency (22Kilsdonk E.P.C. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Google Scholar). We now report our findings on the use of CD to follow movement of de novo synthesized cholesterol to and from the PM and the egress of LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes. We further used CD to reveal that cell surface SM and the Golgi apparatus regulate intracellular transport of cholesterol. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT. Lipoprotein-deficient bovine serum (LPDS) and human low density lipoprotein (LDL) were prepared by Advanced Bioscience Laboratories, Rockville, MD. Glass and plastic microscope culture wells (Lab-Tek) were purchased from Thomas Scientific. [9,10-3H]Oleic acid (10-14 Ci/mmol), [3H]acetate (135 mCi/mmol), [1,2,6,7-3H]cholesteryl oleate (98.5 Ci/mmol), [1,2,6,7-3H]cholesteryl linoleate (87 Ci/mmol), and [5-3H]mevalonate (33 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. Filipin was purchased from Polysciences, Warrington, PA. 2-Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin was purchased from Research Plus, Inc., Bayonne, NJ. Neutral sphingomyelinase (from Staphylococcus aureus) was purchased from Sigma. Brefeldin A was purchased from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI) and stored as a 1 mg/ml stock solution in ethanol at −20°C. Normal and NP-C fibroblasts were derived from volunteers and confirmed patients of the Developmental and Metabolic Neurology Branch under the guidelines approved by clinical and research committees of the National Institutes of Health. Fibroblasts (3-15 passages) were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 2 m glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin/ml in humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C. For biochemical analyses, fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 40,000 cells/well (“subconfluent”) in plastic 6-well dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in McCoy's medium supplemented with 5% LPDS, 2 m glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin/ml (McCoy's/5% LPDS medium) in humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C for 4 days. For cytochemical analyses, fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 20,000 cells/well in McCoy's/5% LPDS medium in 9.5-cm glass microscope wells (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL) coated with human fibronectin. For cholesterol depletion studies, 2-hydroxy-propyl-β-cyclodextrin was routinely added at 2 g/100 ml to McCoy's/5% LPDS medium supplemented with 25 m HEPES, pH 7.0, to adjust pH to 7.2. Human LDL was reconstituted with [3H]cholesteryl linoleate or [3H]cholesteryl oleate as described by Krieger (23Krieger M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 608-613Google Scholar). A modification of the procedure described by Rome et al. (24Rome L.H. Garvin A.J. Allietta M.M. Neufeld E.F. Cell. 1979; 17: 143-153Google Scholar) for the fractionation of human fibroblasts was employed. Cells were harvested by scraping with a razor blade and disrupted by N2 cavitation. A combined postnuclear supernatant fraction (600 × g, 10 min) was obtained from 1 to 2 confluent 75-cm2 flasks that generally contained 0.5-1.0 mg of protein in 2.0 ml of 0.25 sucrose and 1.0 m EDTA, pH 7.0. Stock Percoll was diluted to 10% (v/v) with 0.25 sucrose and 1.0 m EDTA, pH 7.0. The postnuclear supernatant (2.0 ml) was layered on top of 27 ml of 10% Percoll and a 4.0-ml cushion of 2.5 sucrose in Sorvall polyallomer tubes (1 × 3.5 cm). Centrifugation was carried out in a Sorvall SV288 vertical rotor at 28,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C in a Sorvall RC2C Plus centrifuge equipped with a rate controller. Fractions (2.0 ml) were collected from the bottom of the gradients with the aid of a Beckman Fraction Recovery System. A light density membrane fraction as well as a heavy density membrane fraction was found in both normal and NP-C human fibroblast preparations. Alkaline phosphatase assayed by the method of Touster et al. (25Touster O. Aronson Jr., N.N. Dulaney J.T. Hendrickson H. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 47: 604-618Google Scholar) sedimented with the light density protein peak. Cell monolayers were washed directly in their plastic 35-mm wells twice with chilled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then extracted with 0.5 ml of isopropyl alcohol by gentle rocking for 30 min at room temperature in sealed plates. The isopropyl alcohol-extracted lipids were stored at −20°C in sealed tubes until analyzed. The lipid-free cell residues remaining in the culture wells were taken up in 0.5 ml of 0.5 NaOH and protein measured by the method of Lowry et al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). Unesterified and esterified cholesterol levels were measured in aliquots of the isopropyl alcohol extract corresponding to approximately 10 µg of protein with a fluorescently linked assay employing cholesteryl oxidase and cholesteryl esterase as described previously (27Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avigan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Google Scholar). Cellular cholesterol formed by de novo synthesis from [3H]acetate or [3H]mevalonate was measured in a [3H]sterol fraction separated by thin layer chromatography (28Pentchev P.G. Comly M.E. Kruth H.S. Patel S. Proestel M. Weintroub H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2772-2777Google Scholar). Cellular cholesterol esterification was measured by the incorporation of [3H]oleate into newly synthesized sterol esters as described previously (28Pentchev P.G. Comly M.E. Kruth H.S. Patel S. Proestel M. Weintroub H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2772-2777Google Scholar) utilizing thin layer chromatography to separate the formed cholesteryl-[3H]oleate. [3H]Cholesterol in medium was extracted by the Folch method (29Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Google Scholar). Cells in glass slide chambers were washed with PBS, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and then incubated overnight with 0.05% filipin in PBS at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS, mounted in p-phenylenediamine glycerol, and viewed with a Leitz fluorescence microscope by using excitation filter BP-350-410 for filipin. 2-Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD) is an effective sterol acceptor that removes the unesterified cholesterol mass from viable cells in a saturable, concentration-dependent manner (Table I). Approximately 70% of cellular cholesterol can be removed after 4 h treatment with 2% CD at 37°C. The kinetics of cholesterol removal from both normal and NP-C fibroblasts are similar with a biphasic nature (Fig. 1). In cells uniformly labeled with [3H]acetate, approximately 40-50% of the [3H] sterol is depleted within 60 min followed by a slower rate of depletion (t1/2 = 5-6 h). It appears that esterified cholesterol cannot be mobilized to an appreciable extent by CD (Table I). The small amount of cholesterol ester removed does not appear to depend on the concentration of CD.TABLE I.Cholesterol mass in normal human fibroblasts after incubation with various concentrations of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin for 4 hConcentration CDCellular cholesterolFreeaSterol mass is expressed as nmol per mg cell protein of six wells (mean ± S.D.).

Open table in a new tab Exposure of normal and NP-C cultures to neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase) for 1 h resulted in the digestion of 80% of [3H]sphingomyelin formed by de novo biosynthesis (data not shown). SMase treatment dramatically enhances both the rate and extent of removal of cellular [3H]sterol by CD (Fig. 2). Treatment with CD following SM digestion resulted in the removal of cellular sterol in a biphasic manner with an initial rapid rate of depletion (70% within 15 min) followed by a subsequent slower rate of depletion (t1/2 = 5-6 h). Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with CD and SMase concurrently (data not shown). There was no detectable release of lactic acid dehydrogenase to the medium nor altered triglyceride synthesis for up to 2 h of this combined treatment (data not shown). We employed fluorescence microscopy using filipin, a fluorescent marker specific for unesterified cholesterol (30Silberkang M. Havel C.M. Friend D.S. McCarthy B.J. Watson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8503-8511Google Scholar), to demonstrate that CD primarily targets the PM for removal of cellular cholesterol. In normal cells, we have confirmed (31Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Amende L.M. Kruth H.S. Butler J.D. Sokol J. Comly M.E. Vanier M.T. August J.T. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8022-8026Google Scholar) that filipin-cholesterol fluorescence is associated with both the PM and intracellular structures (Fig. 3A). Treatment of these cells with CD alone greatly diminishes PM fluorescence without substantially affecting intracellular staining (Fig. 3B). Filipin-cholesterol fluorescence associated with the PM is essentially eliminated after treatment with CD/SMase (Fig. 3C). In NP-C fibroblasts cultured with LDL, we also confirmed (31Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Amende L.M. Kruth H.S. Butler J.D. Sokol J. Comly M.E. Vanier M.T. August J.T. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8022-8026Google Scholar) that considerable filipin-cholesterol fluorescence is seen at the PM as well as intense fluorescence in perinuclear lysosomes resulting from defective intracellular mobilization of LDL-derived cholesterol in these cells (Fig. 4A). Treatment of these NP-C cells with CD/SMase resulted in complete loss of filipin-cholesterol fluorescence from the PM with no substantial loss of fluorescence from intracellular sites (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Cytochemical assessment of the effect of CD on the distribution of cholesterol in membranes of NP-C fibroblasts cultured with LDL. NP-C human fibroblasts were incubated in McCoy's/5% LPDS medium at 37°C for 4 days. Cells were then incubated in fresh medium containing LDL (50 µg/ml) for 24 h. A portion of the cultures were washed in PBS and then incubated in McCoy's/5% LPDS medium alone for 1 h at 37°C (A). The remaining cultures were incubated in McCoy's/5% LPDS medium containing 2% CD and 0.12 units/ml SMase for 1 h at 37°C (B). The PM of NP-C fibroblasts demonstrates considerable filipin fluorescence (A, arrowheads). Note that CD/SMase treatment eliminated filipin-cholesterol fluorescence at the PM (B, arrowheads) but did not appreciably alter perinuclear lysosomal filipin-cholesterol fluorescence. All photographic exposures and processing were performed identically. (A and B, × 150).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) CD preferentially removes LDL-derived cholesterol from PM as determined by subcellular fractionation. Following incubation of both normal and NP-C fibroblast cultures with LDL [3H]cholesteryl linoleate for 24 h, a portion of the cultures was subsequently treated with CD/SMase. Subcellular fractionation of cell extracts on 10% Percoll gradients reveals two peaks of [3H]cholesterol representing heavy density (fractions 1-5) and light density (fractions 10-15) membranes (Fig. 5). A lysosomal marker (β-hexosaminidase) was found predominantly in the heavy membrane fraction (HM), whereas markers for the PM, Golgi, and ER were found in the light membrane fraction (LM) (data not shown). In normal cells, 60-70% of the total recovered radioactivity was distributed in the LM while 18% was associated with the HM (Fig. 5A). Treatment of these cells with CD/SMase reduced the level of [3H]cholesterol in LM and HM by 64 and 50%, respectively. The loss of radioactivity from LM is consistent with the removal of [3H]cholesterol from the PM. [3H]Cholesterol remaining in LM after CD/SMase treatment may in part represent [3H]cholesterol associated with the Golgi complex and/or ER. The loss of [3H]cholesterol from HM is consistent with a partial transfer of [3H]cholesterol from lysosomes to the PM during depletion with CD. In NP-C cells, the subcellular distribution of LDL-derived [3H]cholesterol was higher in HM (30%) and lower in LM (58%) when compared with normal cells (Fig. 5B), reflecting the defective intracellular distribution of lysosomal cholesterol (15Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Google Scholar). Unlike normal fibroblasts, CD/SMase treatment did not substantially alter the LDL-derived [3H]cholesterol distributed in HM of NP-C fibroblasts. This treatment did, however, produce a decrease by 2/3 in the percentage of the total [3H]cholesterol distributed in LM. Although less lysosomal cholesterol appears at the PM of NP-C cells, a comparable proportion of LDL-derived cholesterol was removed by CD/SMase from this membrane in both cell types. CD can also prevent internalization of PM cholesterol to intracellular compartments. Fibroblasts were treated with SMase to induce movement of PM cholesterol to the ER (10Slotte J.P. Hedstrom G. Rannstrom S. Ekman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 90-96Google Scholar). This incubation, performed in the presence of [3H]oleate to follow arrival of cholesterol at the ER by esterification, was carried out in the absence or presence of CD. Treatment of fibroblasts with SMase stimulated cholesterol esterification (Fig. 6). This SMase-stimulated esterification of cholesterol is markedly suppressed by CD. Fibroblasts were incubated with [3H]mevalonate in the presence or absence of CD to follow incorporation of nascent [3H]sterol into the PM (Fig. 7). CD substantially reduces this cell-associated [3H]sterol (Fig. 7A) without altering total sterol synthesis. A major fraction (80%) of the newly synthesized [3H]sterol was transferred to the medium at 24 h in the presence of CD (Fig. 7B). The relatively small proportion of newly synthesized [3H]sterol (20%) that remained associated with cells may represent intracellular pools or a more highly resistant PM sterol pool. The arrival of lysosomal cholesterol at the PM can be detected with CD. Normal and NP-C fibroblasts were incubated with LDL[3H]cholesteryl oleate in the presence of progesterone in order to sequester [3H]cholesterol in lysosomes (32Butler J.D. Blanchette-Mackie J. Goldin E. O'Neill R.R. Carstea G. Roff C.F. Patterson M.C. Patel S. Comly M.E. Cooney A. Vanier M.T. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23797-23805Google Scholar). Progesterone was washed from cultures (to initiate [3H]cholesterol transport out of lysosomes) in the presence of CD. Reduction in this cell-associated [3H]cholesterol in the presence of CD corresponded to its appearance in the medium (Fig. 8). Lysosomally derived [3H]cholesterol was lost from normal cells with a half-life of 4 h and from NP-C cells with a half-life of 8.5 h, reflecting the documented lesion in transfer of cholesterol from lysosomes to the PM (15Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Google Scholar). Arrival of lysosomal cholesterol at the PM can also be indirectly monitored by assessing the effect of CD on the level of cholesterol esterified during its release from lysosomes. LDL-derived lysosomal cholesterol has been shown to be transported to the PM (15Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Google Scholar, 33Brasaemle D.L. Attie A.D. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Google Scholar) where it enriches a precursor pool of cholesterol destined to be esterified in the ER (35Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Google Scholar, 36Tabas I. Rosoff W.J. Boykow G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1266-1272Google Scholar, 37Nagy L. Freeman D.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 809-814Google Scholar, 38Liscum L. Faust J.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 221-226Google Scholar). One would predict that CD can retard cellular cholesterol esterification by removing substrate from the PM. This was tested by loading the lysosomes of cultured fibroblasts with LDL-derived cholesterol using progesterone. During a subsequent period of progesterone washout, cells were incubated with [3H]oleate (to assay esterification) in the absence or presence of 2% CD (to remove PM cholesterol). CD strongly inhibited the esterification normally seen during progesterone washout (Fig. 9A) consistent with the relocation of a large portion of lysosomal cholesterol to the PM prior to its esterification in the ER. The metabolic suppression of [3H]oleate incorporation is specific for cholesterol esterification since CD did not alter triglyceride synthesis (data not shown). The level of esterification induced in cholesterol-loaded NP-C cells during progesterone washout was approximately 20-fold less than that observed in normal cells (Fig. 9B). CD did not suppress this attenuated level of esterification (Fig. 9B), consistent with a disrupted movement of lysosomal cholesterol to the PM in the mutant cells. The residual esterification in NP-C cells may represent intracellular routing of lysosomal cholesterol to the ER via a pathway that bypasses the PM. Removal of PM sphingomyelin can affect the intracellular transport path of lysosomal cholesterol. Our experimental protocol was to load the lysosomes of cultured normal fibroblasts with LDL-cholesterol using progesterone. These cells were then briefly treated with SMase to deplete PM SM, followed by washing the progesterone from the cultures to establish cholesterol transport out of lysosomes. During progesterone washout cells were incubated with [3H]oleate in the absence or presence of CD. As established above (Fig. 9), CD alone can effectively suppress esterification of cholesterol in untreated cells (Fig. 10A). Depletion of PM SM alone does not alter the level of esterification of lysosomal cholesterol (cf. Fig. 10, A and B). However, when cells were exposed to SMase, CD no longer blocked cholesterol esterification (Fig. 10B). This loss in the sensitivity of esterification to CD modulation occurs under conditions that render cells particularly sensitive to removal of PM sterol (Fig. 2). These data suggest that depletion of PM SM diverts the trafficking of lysosomal cholesterol away from the PM without diminishing its accessibility to the ER. The current studies with CD provide evidence that the Golgi plays a key role in the movement of LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes to the PM. Lysosomes of normal and NP-C fibroblasts were loaded with LDL-cholesterol using progesterone. Lysosomal cholesterol transport was re-established with progesterone washout, and cells were incubated with [3H]oleate in the presence or absence of BFA and/or CD. The effective suppression of cholesterol esterification by CD during progesterone washout in normal fibroblasts (Fig. 11A) was largely lost when BFA was added (Fig. 11B). This finding does not result from a loss in the ability of CD to remove [3H]sterol from the PM of BFA-treated cells labeled to equilibrium with [3H]acetate (data not shown). The loss of CD-mediated suppression of esterification in the presence of BFA suggests that disruption of the Golgi complex (39Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Google Scholar) reduces the intracellular trafficking of lysosomal cholesterol to the PM without substantially diminishing its accessibility to the ER. In NP-C cells, CD does not suppress the attenuated cholesterol esterification either in the presence (Fig. 11C) or absence (Fig. 11D) of BFA. In these mutant cells, BFA stimulates cholesterol esterification 4-fold (Fig. 11D). The BFA-induced increase in cholesterol esterification is consistent with previous observations (40Stein O. Ben-Naim M. Dabach Y. Hollander G. Stein Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 291-297Google Scholar, 41Kallen K.-J. Quinn P. Allan D. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 307-312Google Scholar, 42Ridgway N.D. Lagace T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8023-8031Google Scholar) and suggests that Golgi cholesterol can be absorbed into the ER along with other Golgi components. The Golgi also appears to play a role in the movement of PM cholesterol to the ER in normal and NP-C cells. Such movement can be induced by treating cells with SMase and assessed by measuring esterification (10Slotte J.P. Hedstrom G. Rannstrom S. Ekman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 90-96Google Scholar). When cells are treated with either BFA or SMase alone there is a relatively weak stimulation in esterification of PM sterol (Fig. 12). However, when BFA and SMase are both present, there is a dramatic inc"

The importance of Arf proteins in both membrane traffic and organelle organization was manifest due to the sensitivities of most Arf proteins to both GTPγS, a slowly hydrolyzable GTP analog, and to brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal metabolite capable of inhibiting guanine nucleotide exchange on Arf in a crude system (17Donaldson J.G.

The activation (GTP binding) and deactivation (GTP hydrolysis) cycle of Arf action in cells is thought to coincide with its binding and release, respectively, from intracellular membranes. In this model, activation of a soluble Arf protein results in its translocation to a membrane and the recruitment, through unknown mechanisms, of coat proteins or adaptor complexes to that membrane. It remains unclear how, or even if, Arf-mediated activation of phospholipase D or cholera toxin relate to mechanisms of regulation of membrane transport by Arf proteins. Six mammalian Arf genes have been described, encoding proteins whose predicted sequences are highly conserved (3Boman A.L. Kahn R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 147-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Human, bovine, and murine Arf1, for example, are 100% identical. Indeed, the only differences in primary sequences of Arf isoforms between human and rodents appear in Arf4. There is also considerable conservation of Arf function across wide species boundaries. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has only two Arf genes, but each of the five known human Arf proteins can restore vegetative growth to yeast mutants harboring an otherwise lethal deletion of both yeast Arf proteins (20Stearns T. Hoyt M.A. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6690-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 21Kahn R.A. Kern F.G. Clark J. Gelmann E.P. Rulka C. J. Biol.

If all human Arf proteins are functionally redundant, why are there so many Arf genes? Are they expressed in different tissues, or at different times during development, or localized to discrete intracellular sites? Recent investigations of Arf function in transfected cells has begun to suggest that there may be at least some specificity in the activities of individual Arf proteins. Although Arf1, Arf3, and Arf4 appear to be functionally redundant, 2C. J. Zhang, K. Johnson, M. C. Willingham, W. B. Greene, A. G. Rosenwald, and R. A. Kahn, submitted for publication. results from cell lines overexpressing wild type or mutant Arf1 or Arf6 have led to the conclusion that Arf1 acts at the Golgi while Arf6 is found at the plasma membrane and in endosomes (1D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 2Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Like Rab proteins, Arf proteins may act to control events on the organelles to which they are localized. On the other hand, the fact that a single Arf (Arf1) can mediate the in vitro recruitment of two distinct coat proteins (AP-1 adaptors, COP-I coat components) to three distinct compartments (trans-Golgi network, cis-Golgi/intermediate compartment/ER, and endosomes (4Donaldson J.G.

As overexpression or epitope tagging may alter the function or distribution of Arf proteins or even cell viability (28Kahn R.A. Clark J. Rulka C. Stearns T. Zhang C. Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Cavenagh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), 3M. M. Cavenagh, R. Kamath, and R. A. Kahn, manuscript in preparation. it is important to establish the distribution and membrane binding activities of endogenous Arf proteins when possible. Using isoform-specific antibodies, we have determined the tissue distribution, intracellular localization, and membrane binding activities of each of the five known human Arf proteins. Surprisingly, Arf6 was found to behave quite distinctly from the other four human Arf proteins, being present exclusively, and apparently permanently, on the plasma membrane. Peptides derived from human Arf proteins (see Fig. 1) were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, as described previously (30Mumby S.M. Kahn R.A. Manning D.R. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Each conjugated peptide was suspended in complete Freund's adjuvant and injected intradermally at multiple sites into three rabbits, with two boosts at 3-week intervals. The sera were tested for reactivity with the antigenic peptide by ELISA. All reactive sera were tested for specificity by immunoblotting against purified recombinant Arf proteins, and the most sensitive and specific antisera were chosen for more extensive characterization and subsequent work. None of the antibodies described herein were found to cross-react with the purified recombinant Arf-like proteins, Arl2 or Arl3 (data not shown), each of which share 40-50% sequence identity with Arf proteins. The antisera raised against Arf1 (R-1026), Arf5 (R-1525), and Arf6 (R-1471) were found to be highly specific for their respective proteins (Fig. 2). The antiserum raised against Arf3 (R-1023) cross-reacted with Arf1, but could be made specific for Arf3 by preincubating the antibody with the corresponding Arf1 peptide, P-34. The Arf4 antiserum, R-891, was found to cross-react with Arf5, but this reactivity was not specific as it was not blocked by preincubation with the immunizing peptide (P-19; see Fig. 2). Mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for Arf proteins were produced according to standard procedures (31Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) at Hazelton Laboratories. Purified recombinant human Arf1 was used to immunize mice and assay cell fusions and cultures by ELISA. Culture supernatants from hybridomas positive by ELISA were then assayed for the ability to recognize Arf1 in immunoblots. Four cell lines were positive in both assays and hybridomas were cloned by three rounds of limited dilution. Only one of these, termed 1D9, was used in the current study. Specific antibodies were purified from pooled ascites of 10 mice injected with hybridoma 1D9 by affinity chromatography on a protein G-agarose column. The purified antibody was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and was stored at a concentration of 6.7 mg/ml. The use of monoclonal 1D9 has been reported previously, but its specificity and sensitivity are characterized for the first time below. It is likely that 1D9 binds to a linear epitope found in Arf proteins, as it binds to proteins on nitrocellulose and immunoprecipitates them from detergent-containing solutions after denaturation of proteins in boiling SDS. The epitope recognized by 1D9 was investigated in two ways. A series of 88 peptide octamers (mimetopes) were synthesized by Chiron Mimetopes (Emeryville, CA), starting with the N-terminal octapeptide and moving two residues toward the C terminus to the end. ELISA assay of these peptides with 1D9 identified a number of potential epitopes. However, reactivity with secondary antibodies and difficulties with regenerating the peptides for consecutive assays limited our confidence in the results of this approach. However, one of the few potential epitopes identified in this manner included the only residue that was found by inspection to be absolutely conserved in Arf proteins 1, 3, 5, and 6 and different in (the less reactive) Arf4; specifically lysine 73 in the sequence Gln-Asp-Lys-Ile-Arg is Gln-Asp-Arg-Ile-Arg in Arf4 (see Fig. 1). To test the hypothesis that this lysine is a part of the epitope of 1D9, this residue was mutated to lysine in the Arf4 sequence. When recombinant [R73K]Arf4 was purified from bacteria the mutant protein was found to have increased (over that of wild type Arf4) immunoreactivity with 1D9 to a level comparable to that of Arf1. Thus, we conclude that this lysine is a critical part of the epitope for 1D9 and likely explains the lower sensitivity to Arf4 (see below). This region is highly divergent in all other GTP-binding proteins examined, including the Arf-like (Arl) proteins, and explains, at least in part, the specificity of 1D9 for Arf proteins. However, an 11-residue peptide, derived from the sequence of Arf1 with the key lysine in the middle, failed to compete for 1D9 immunoreactivity in immunoblots. Recombinant Arf proteins were purified from BL21(DE3) cells as described previously for Arf1 (32Weiss O. Holden J. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins do not have identical electrophoretic mobilities with the same isoforms in cells or tissues. This is due, at least in part, to the lack of N-terminal myristoylation of the recombinant proteins. Thus, electrophoretic mobility alone is not a reliable indicator of Arf isoforms. Normal rat kidney cells, stably transfected with plasmids directing the inducible expression of each of the human Arf proteins, were obtained and grown as described previously (9Zhang C.J. Rosenwald A.G. Willingham M.C. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer either before or after induction with 1,000 units/ml interferon for 18 h. Total cellular proteins were resolved in 10-20% gradient polyacrylamide gels, and immunoblotting was performed as described below. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Schaffner and Weissman (34Schaffner W. Weissman C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). Human tissue protein samples were purchased from Clontech Laboratories and were supplied as solutions of SDS-solubilized proteins in Laemmli's sample buffer. Each sample was prepared from tissue obtained from a single individual; thus, variations among the human population were not addressed. Protein samples (15 µg of tissue lysates) were separated on gradient 10-20% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) before transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in Blotto (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5% nonfat dry milk, 80 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 0.02% sodium azide) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated with filters at 4°C overnight, or at room temperature for at least 2 h. The dilutions of rabbit polyclonal antisera used varied between 1/500 to 1/2,000, depending on sensitivities (see Table I). Incubations in secondary antibody, donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.), were performed at room temperature for 1-2 h. Signal was detected using Amersham's ECL Western blotting detection reagents according to manufacturer's instructions. Most of the polyclonal antibodies interacted nonspecifically with proteins in the tissue extract other than Arf. Each of the isoform-specific antibodies were analyzed in pairs, one membrane incubated with the diluted antiserum, and the other with diluted antiserum after preincubation with 10 µg/ml immunizing peptide. Only signals that were present on the first blot and absent on the second were considered specific. With only one or two minor exceptions, specific immunostaining was observed only in the 20-kDa region of the gels.TABLE IList of antibodies and peptides generatedArfAntibodyImmunogenDilutionSensitivityCross-reactivity1R-1026P341/5005 ng3R-1023P331/2,0005 ngArf1, blocked with P344R-891P191/5001 ng5R-1525P401/2,0002 ng6R-1471P421/1,0005 ngAll1D9Arf11-10 µg/ml<1 ng1/3/5/6; ≈10 ng of 4 Open table in a new tab Purified recombinant Arf proteins were diluted in PBS, deposited onto a nitrocellulose membrane held in a Schleicher & Schuell slot-blot manifold, and allowed to bind at room temperature for 1 h before being washed with PBS (31Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The membranes were either immediately incubated with antibodies, as described above, or air-dried and stored at room temperature for later use. CHO cells were fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and free flow electrophoresis (FFE), a method that permits an effective one-step separation of endosomes from Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membranes as described previously (27Whitney J.A.

A. 1991; 88: 6313-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Endosomes were first labeled by incubating the cells for 10 min in medium containing 2 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Sigma Type IV; Sigma). After washing in the cold, the cells were disrupted in TEAS (10 mM triethanolamine, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM sucrose, pH 7.4) using a ball bearing homogenizer, and membranes were concentrated by flotation on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. The membranes (1 mg/ml) were treated briefly with a low concentration of trypsin (1-2 µg/mg of membrane protein, 4 min, 37°C), quenched with excess soybean trypsin inhibitor, and subjected to FFE. In control experiments, the trypsin treatment was found not to affect subsequent binding of Arf proteins; similarly, recovery of all endogenous markers (including Arf proteins) was quantitative throughout the procedure. Individual fractions were assayed for organelle-specific markers using both enzymatic assays and immunoblots. Total CHO membranes and cytosol were prepared by centrifugation of a post-nuclear supernatant (250 × g supernatant) at 150,000 × g for 60 min. Pellets (membranes) and supernatants (cytosol) were collected separately and adjusted to equal volumes in TEAS. Triton X-100 was added to 0.1%, and proteins were precipitated using methanol and chloroform. Precipitates were resuspended in Laemmli's sample buffer and prepared for immunoblotting as described above. The binding of cytosolic Arf proteins to isolated membrane fractions was determined using a slight modification (27Whitney J.A. Gomez M. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. Cell. 1995; 83: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) of previously published methods (4Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes (30 µg of membrane protein) were incubated with cytosol for 15 min in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system in the presence or absence of 200 µM BFA and/or 25 µM GTPγS. Membranes were pelleted for 10 min at 14,000 × g in a TLA 100.2 rotor, resuspended in Laemmli's sample buffer, and resolved by electrophoresis on 10-20% SDS-PAGE gradient gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose, immunoblotting was performed using antibodies to Arf proteins and the coatomer component β-COP (38Pepperkok R. Scheel J. Horstmann H. Hauri H.P. Griffiths G. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 71-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Cytosol from CHO cells was prepared in 1 mM ATP as described (39Podbilewicz B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). CHO membranes (≈25 µg; prepared by flotation on sucrose density gradients) were incubated (in the presence of 0.2 M sucrose) in 0.5 M Tris (pH 7.0), 0.1 M sodium carbonate (pH 11), or 1 M NaCl for 30 min on ice. The membranes were then collected by centrifugation onto a 1 M sucrose cushion using a TLA 100.2 rotor as above. The cushion and interface were collected, brought to 0.2 M sucrose, and subjected to another round of stripping. Membranes were then pelleted in a microcentrifuge, and the pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotting performed using antibodies to Arf6 or to α-adaptin. Clathrin-coated vesicles used in these studies were prepared from cow brains by a modification of the method of Campbell et al. (40Campbell C.R. Squicciarini J. Shia M. Pilch P.F. Fine R.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4420-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Bovine brain and rabbit liver clathrin-coated vesicles were also kindly provided by Dr. Linton Traub, Washington University, St. Louis, MO. The subcellular distribution of each Arf isoform was determined using a battery of isoform-specific polyclonal antisera, raised against peptides derived from each protein. These antisera are described under “Materials and Methods” and shown in Table I and Fig. 1. In addition, a monoclonal antibody, termed 1D9, was produced and found to recognize all human Arf proteins, although its sensitivity toward Arf4 was relatively poor (Fig. 2). Antisera R-1026 (αArf1), R-1023 (αArf3), and R-1471 (αArf6) had similar sensitivities, capable of detecting ≥5 ng of protein in a lane of a Western blot. R-891 (αArf4) and R-1525 (αArf5) were 2-5 fold more sensitive than the other sera. 1D9 had a lower limit of detection of <1 ng for Arf proteins 1, 3, 5, and 6 but about 10 ng for Arf4 (see Table I). The specificity and sensitivities of these antibodies make them generally useful for determining the expression of human Arf proteins in total cell or tissue homogenates. These reagents were used to examine Arf expression in eight human tissues by immunoblotting, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Results of this screen revealed a poor correlation between the levels of expression of Arf proteins and their messages (data not shown). In addition, each Arf protein appears to have a unique pattern of expression in these tissues (Fig. 3). Arf1 and Arf3 are usually expressed to the highest levels (typically 0.03-0.1% total cell protein). The greater sensitivity of the anti-Arf4 antibody can give the mistaken impression that Arf4 is expressed to similar levels (see Fig. 3). However, quantitative immunoblotting of many cell and tissue samples confirm that Arf4-6 are usually expressed at levels 3-10-fold below those of Arf1 and Arf3. This finding likely explains the observation that Arf1 and Arf3 have been consistently identified in purified Arf preparations (6Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C.

The levels of Arf4-6 are similar, although the higher sensitivity of the αArf4 antiserum allows this isoform to be readily observed in human tissues (Fig. 3). Arf6 expression is inexplicably and uniquely very high in the ovary (estimated ≈0.2% total tissue protein). The availability of isoform-specific antibodies allowed us to ask whether endogenous Arf proteins could be distinguished on the basis of their intracellular localizations. CHO cells were a good source for these studies as each of the five human Arf proteins have homologs in hamster that are expressed in levels detectable with isoform-specific antisera and 1D9. However, only the Arf4 antibody, R-891, and 1D9 proved useful for indirect immunofluorescence.2 We therefore localized each Arf protein by subcellular fractionation. CHO cells were first separated into membrane and soluble fractions to determine the amount of each Arf that would remain membrane-bound after homogenization. As shown in Fig. 4, Arf proteins 1, 3, 4, and 5 were found predominantly (>90%) in the high speed supernatant after ultracentrifugation of CHO cell homogenates. While low levels (<10% of cytosol) of Arf proteins 1-5 can usually be found on any membrane fraction, Arf6 was found exclusively in the high speed pellet. Even after long exposure times, Arf6 was not detectable in the soluble, cytosol fraction. Thus, Arf6 was distinguished from all other Arf proteins by its membrane association after cell homogenization. It should be noted that brain appears to be different from other tissues in yielding a high percentage of particulate Arf after homogenization (≈50% total Arf), which facilitated its purification from this tissue in large amounts (43Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Assessment of the function of the cytochrome c-cytochrome oxidase segment of the electron transport chain of apoptotic mitochondria showed that the activity of cytochrome oxidase appeared to be normal, but that of cytochrome c was greatly diminished. A death protease was found to participate in the events leading to the loss of cytochrome c activity, but the cytochrome did not seem to be extensively degraded during the course of apoptosis.

Most cells are equipped with a program whose activation results in a stereotyped series of events that culminate in the death and fragmentation of the cell. In aggregate, these events are referred to as apoptosis, and their effect is to destroy the cell without releasing its contents into the external environment. During apoptosis, the surface of the dying cell is altered so as to mark the cell and its fragments as targets for macrophages, which ingest and degrade the remains. During apoptosis, much of the cell's contents, including many of its organelles, its cytoskeleton and its plasma membrane undergo far-reaching changes. In the nucleus, the chromatin is disrupted, lamin B (1Neamati N. Fernandez A. Wright S. Kiefer J. McConkey D.J. J.

Cytoskeletal changes result in nuclear fragmentation and blebbing at the cell periphery, substance being lost when a bleb detaches from the main body of the cell, sometimes taking with it a fragment of nucleus. Alterations in cell lipids also occur, with a large increase in levels of ceramide (7Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A.

Using specific substrates and tumor necrosis factor-α-treated L929 cells, Schulze-Osthoff et al. (17Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that electron flow through all four mitochondrial electron transport complexes fell steadily, declining at a rate that was approximately equal among the complexes as the cells progressed through apoptosis. We have studied mitochondrial function in Jurkat cells sent into apoptosis with an anti-Fas IgM, and report that the defect in mitochondrial electron transport observed by ourselves and others in apoptotic cells is due at least in part to the inactivation of cytochrome c. Jurkat cells, a lymphoblastoid T-cell line, were the kind gift of D. Green, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology. They were cultured at 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 m -glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. Individual cultures were maintained for no more than 2 months. Apoptosis was induced by treatment with anti-Fas IgM (clone CH-11, Kamiya Biomedical Co., Thousand Oaks, CA) at the concentration indicated in the figure legends. Cells were applied to glass slides (Superfrost/Plus, Fisher), fixed for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% formalin solution, rinsed in methanol, and air-dried. A drop of acridine orange solution (4 g/ml) was placed over the cells, a coverslip was added, and the cells were viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptotic cells were scored based on characteristic changes of chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. On each slide, a minimum of 200 cells were evaluated. DNA content and mitochondrial membrane potential were analyzed on a Coulter Elite flow cytometer. For measurements of DNA content, cells were fixed in 50% ethanol and stored at 4°C until analysis, when they were stained with propidium iodide (50 µg/ml), treated with RNase (10 µg/ml), and washed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. DNA content was calculated from the flow cytometry data using MulticycleC software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego) (19Telford W.G. King L.E. Fraker P.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 172: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To determine the mitochondrial membrane potential during apoptosis, the cells were treated with anti-Fas antibody (100 ng/ml) for 2 h in serum-free RPMI. During the last 30 min of treatment, the cells were loaded with di-OC6(3) 1The abbreviations used are: di-OC6(3)3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodideCCCPcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazoneMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidTMPDtetramethyl-p-phenylenediamineZ-VAD-fluoromethyl ketonecarbobenzoxy-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone.

At the conclusion of the incubation, the cells were isolated by centrifugation, resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution and analyzed immediately. The zero-time value and the value for mitochondria whose transmembrane potential was discharged with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) were obtained from cells that had been incubated for 30 min with di-OC6(3) without exposure to anti-Fas antibody. 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine carbobenzoxy-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone. A Clarke oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH) with a thermojacketed chamber was used. To induce apoptosis, cells were treated in culture (serum-free RPMI) with anti-Fas antibody (100 ng/ml) at the times indicated; control cells were incubated in a similar manner either with an irrelevant IgM antibody (an anti-cytochrome P450 monoclonal antibody generously provided by Dr. Eric Johnson) or without antibody. The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in respiration buffer (0.25 sucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 m MgCl2, 10 m K+Hepes, 5 m KH2PO4, pH 7.2) at a final concentration of 6 × 107 cells/ml. One-half ml of the suspension was injected into a chamber containing 2.5 ml of air-saturated respiration buffer, 1 m ADP that had been prewarmed to 37°C. The cells were permeabilized with digitonin (final concentration 0.005%), and substrates and inhibitors were added in the following order and final concentrations: malate, 5 m pyruvate, 5 m; rotenone, 100 n; succinate, 5 m; antimycin A, 50 n; ascorbate, 1 m (2 m in experiments using horse heart cytochrome c) with TMPD (tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine) 0.4 m; NaN3, 5 m. In most of the experiments, only antimycin A, ascorbate/TMPD, and NaN3 were used. Where noted, the uncoupling agent CCCP was added at a final concentration of 5 µ. Oxygen concentration was calibrated with air-saturated buffer, assuming 390 ng-atoms of oxygen/ml of buffer (17Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient downward deflections indicate the points at which new reagents were added to the samples in the oxygen electrodes. Rates of azide-sensitive oxygen consumption are expressed as ng-atoms of oxygen/min/3 × 107 cells. Jurkat cells (108) were incubated for 2.5-3.5 h at 37°C with anti-Fas antibody (50 ng/ml) or with no antibody. Crude mitochondria were prepared as described, with minor modifications (20Bourgeron T. Chretien D. Rotig A. Munnich A. Rustin P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were washed once with buffer A (100 m sucrose, 1 m EGTA, 20 m MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), then resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B (buffer A plus 10 m triethanolamine, 5% Percoll, 0.01% digitonin, and the protease inhibitors aprotinin (10 µ), pepstatin A (10 µ), leupeptin (10 µ), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 m)). After chilling for 3 min on ice, the cells were disrupted by 20 strokes of a glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged twice to remove unbroken cells and nuclei (2500 × g, 5 min, 4°C). The mitochondria were then pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min and resuspended in 100 µl of buffer C (300 m sucrose, 1 m EGTA, 20 m MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors as above, except for phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). All steps were performed on ice or at 4°C. Mitochondria were prepared as described above from Jurkat cells that had been incubated for 3.5 h at 37°C with or without anti-Fas antibody (50 ng/ml). Mitochondrial difference spectra were obtained by subtraction of the absorption spectra of the unreduced mitochondria from that of mitochondria that had been reduced by dithionite (20Bourgeron T. Chretien D. Rotig A. Munnich A. Rustin P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using a DW-2000 SLM/Aminco dual wavelength spectrophotometer. Cytochrome oxidase activity of the isolated mitochondria (about 50 µg of protein/assay) was measured spectrophotometrically by following the azide-inhibitable oxidation of ascorbate-reduced cytochrome c (horse heart, Sigma) at 550 nm, determining initial rates from slopes obtained between the first and third minutes of observation (21Errede B. Kamen M.D. Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1978; LIII: 40-47Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Km values were determined from an Eadie-Hofstee plot. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis was carried out using a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Cytochrome c was detected by a heme stain (22Bass W.T. Bricker T.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 330-338Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), using horse heart cytochrome c as standard. Jurkat cells (5 × 107) were incubated for 90 min with or without anti-Fas antibody (100 ng/ml). Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 200 µl of respiration buffer, disrupted by sonication on ice (10 3-s bursts, setting 2, Heat Systems Ultrasonics), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant (200 µl, representing 5 × 107 cell equivalents) was added to cells (3.6 × 107) permeabilized with 0.0375% digitonin and incubated at 37°C. After 10 min, measurement of oxygen consumption was initiated. Control Jurkat cells and cells treated with anti-Fas antibody were collected by centrifugation (2000 rpm for 3 min at room temperature in a Beckman GPR centrifuge). The cell pellet was fixed in Karnovsky's fixative, embedded in epon resin (T. Pella Eponate 812) and cut into 100-nm sections with an LKB Ultratome V. The sections were stained with Reynold's lead citrate and examined under a Hitachi HU 12A transmission electron microscope at 75 kV. Each oxygen electrode tracing shown in this paper is representative of at least two experiments. Mitochondrial electron transport is mediated by four multisubunit complexes, designated complexes I-IV, that reside in the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 1). Complexes I and II accept electrons from NADH and succinate, respectively, then pass these electrons on to Complex III via ubiquinone, a low molecular weight redox carrier. Complex III transfers the electrons to cytochrome c, which in turn donates them to Complex IV (cytochrome oxidase). From there the electrons are transferred 4 at a time to molecular oxygen, producing 2 molecules of water. The function of these complexes in mitochondria from control cells and cells treated with anti-Fas antibody was assayed by the sequential addition of substrates specific for various segments of the electron transport path after permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane with digitonin (Fig. 2). The malate-pyruvate combination, which transfers electrons to oxygen via NADH → I → III → IV, produced little oxygen consumption in either control or apoptotic cells. Succinate, however, passing electrons to oxygen via II → III → IV, generated oxygen uptake that was readily apparent in control cells but not detectable in apoptotic cells. Most striking were the ascorbate/TMPD results, which reflect only electron transport through cytochrome oxidase. With ascorbate/TMPD as substrate, oxygen uptake by apoptotic cells was only a small fraction of that seen with the control cells. The marked inhibition of oxygen uptake in control cells by N−3 indicated that cytochrome oxidase was responsible for almost all the oxygen taken up by these cells. These results indicate that electron transport by cytochrome oxidase was greatly inhibited in apoptotic cells, a finding that could also explain the reduction in oxygen uptake in response to succinate, because succinate electrons have to pass through cytochrome oxidase on their way to oxygen. Fig. 3 shows the time course of cytochrome oxidase inhibition. For this experiment, a suspension of Jurkat cells was incubated with anti-Fas antibody, and samples were withdrawn at various time intervals for measurement of oxygen consumption. A reduction in oxygen consumption could be detected as early as 45 min after Fas ligation. By 60 min, oxygen consumption was inhibited by 70%. Under similar conditions, oxygen consumption by control cells (incubated with an irrelevant IgM) remained relatively constant. At each time point, aliquots of the cells were fixed and analyzed for apoptosis by nuclear morphology (acridine orange staining) and flow cytometry (analysis of ploidy by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining). The results (Table I) indicated that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration preceded the nuclear changes of apoptosis. One possible explanation for our findings would be a generalized disruption of mitochondrial structure. To investigate this possibility, we treated Jurkat cells with anti-Fas antibody for 90 min, a time point at which oxygen consumption was inhibited by more than 95%, then examined the cells by electron microscopy (Fig. 4). The nuclei of the control cells were normal in appearance, large and containing well dispersed chromatin. In contrast, the nuclei of most of the anti-Fas-treated cells showed chromatin that was condensed and of a monotonous texture, and many of these nuclei were fragmented. In cells showing these advanced nuclear abnormalities, however, morphological changes in the mitochondria were minor; inner and outer mitochondrial membranes were clearly evident, and cristae appeared intact, although the mitochondria did appear to be slightly swollen, with a more empty-appearing matrix. Thus major mitochondrial disruption at an ultrastructural level did not appear to explain the observed inhibition of electron transport. Electron transport in mitochondria is normally coupled tightly to the biosynthesis of ATP, which is driven by the passage of protons into the mitochondrial matrix through a channel in the ATP-synthesizing enzyme (the mitochondrial H+-ATPase; Complex V). If the mitochondria assayed in these experiments were tightly coupled, a failure of Complex V would arrest electron transport. Under these circumstances, the addition of an uncoupling agent such as CCCP would be expected to restore oxygen uptake to near normal levels. We found, however, that the addition of CCCP to apoptotic cells incubated with ascorbate/TMPD did not increase oxygen uptake (Fig. 2). This finding indicates that the inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport in apoptotic cells was irrelevant to the coupling of electron transport to ATP production. Taken together, our observations up to this point suggested that apoptosis had a direct effect on electron transport through cytochrome oxidase. We therefore focused our investigations on this redox complex. Ascorbate/TMPD does not reduce cytochrome oxidase directly, however, but instead reduces cytochrome c, which then acts as the reducing agent for cytochrome oxidase. To measure the activity of cytochrome oxidase more directly, we employed a spectrophotometric assay based on the oxidation of exogenously added cytochrome c (21Errede B. Kamen M.D. Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1978; LIII: 40-47Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We found to our surprise that the activities of cytochrome oxidase were similar in control and anti-Fas-treated cells (Table II). Furthermore, the interaction between cytochrome oxidase and cytochrome c did not appear to be affected by apoptosis, because the apparent Km for cytochrome c was the same for control mitochondria and mitochondria isolated from cells treated with anti-Fas antibody (Table II). The foregoing results suggested that the cytochrome oxidase in anti-Fas-treated cells was intact, and that the failure of electron transport through Complex IV in mitochondria from apoptotic cells was the result of cytochrome c inactivation. This formulation predicts that exogenous cytochrome c would normalize oxygen consumption in apoptotic cells. To test this prediction, cytochrome c (5-45 µ in sequential additions) was added along with ascorbate/TMPD to permeabilized cells that had been treated either with anti-Fas antibody or with no antibody for 90 min before permeabilization. Assays of oxygen uptake showed that in anti-Fas-treated cells, the very low rate of cytochrome oxidase-mediated oxygen consumption (3.5 ng-atoms/min) was largely corrected by the addition of cytochrome c (Fig. 5). At the highest concentration of cytochrome c, oxygen consumption was 80% of normal. Furthermore, the Km for cytochrome c calculated from these oxygen uptake measurements was 20 µ, in reasonable agreement with the Km values determined from measurements of cytochrome c oxidation. In contrast, exogenous cytochrome c did not enhance oxygen consumption in control cells. These findings suggest that cytochrome c is specifically inactivated during Fas-mediated apoptosis. Cytochrome c is located in the intermembrane space of mitochondria. One possible explanation for the inactivation of cytochrome c observed in our experiments was that digitonin permeabilization of the cells would render the intermembrane space accessible to cytosolic components that are normally excluded from that space. If cytochrome c inactivation were due solely to the invasion of the intermembrane space by such cytosolic components after digitonin permeabilization, then measurements of oxygen uptake obtained immediately after digitonin treatment should be similar for anti-Fas-treated and control cells, since the cytosolic components responsible for the inactivation of the cytochrome would not have had time to work. If however, cytochrome c inactivation had occurred in anti-Fas-treated cells before digitonin permeabilization, then inactivation of cytochrome c (and the consequent decrease in electron transport through cytochrome oxidase) would be apparent immediately upon digitonin permeabilization. To examine these possibilities, we first treated cells for 90 min with anti-Fas antibody or no antibody, then introduced the cells into the oxygen electrode in the absence of digitonin and finally added digitonin together with ascorbate/TMPD. We found that oxygen uptake was already inhibited when measured immediately after digitonin permeabilization, and that it could be restored by the addition of cytochrome c (Fig. 6). These findings suggest that Fas-mediated inactivation of mitochondrial electron transport occurs in intact cells and is not merely a consequence of digitonin permeabilization. These findings also suggest that cytochrome c is a specific target of inactivation during Fas-mediated apoptosis. Cytochrome c possesses a covalently linked heme group through which electrons are transferred. To determine if cytochrome c or its prosthetic heme group was degraded during Fas-mediated apoptosis, difference spectra (oxidized minus reduced) of the mitochondrial cytochromes were obtained using whole mitochondria obtained from control or anti-Fas-treated cells, and cytochrome c in the cell lysates was analyzed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, visualizing with a heme stain (22Bass W.T. Bricker T.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 330-338Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Alterations of cytochrome c could be reflected by a change in A550/A563 in the absorption spectrum (i.e. a change in the apparent ratio of cytochrome c to cytochrome b), a change in the electrophoretic mobility of the cytochrome, or both. The spectra of control and apoptotic mitochondria were found to be similar, however, and on gel electrophoresis the cytochrome obtained from apoptotic cells was similar in quantity and mobility to the cytochrome from control cells (Fig. 7). The lack of a detectable change in the A550/A563 ratio or in the electrophoretic mobility of the cytochrome at a time when mitochondrial electron transport was >90% inhibited suggests that the inactivation of cytochrome c did not involve extensive degradation of the protein or loss of the heme group. Limited proteolysis or other minor modifications of the cytochrome, however, might not have been detected in these experiments. Fas-mediated apoptosis is thought to involve the activation of one or more of a large group of death proteases that participate in apoptosis by cleaving a well defined group of proteins carboxyl to an aspartate residue (23Los M. Van de Craen M. Penning L.C. Schenk H. Westendorp M. Baeuerle P.A. Dröge W. Krammer P.H. Fiers W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nature. 1995; 375: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 24Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). To determine if Fas-mediated inactivation of cytochrome c required protease activity, cells were preincubated for 90 min with Z-VAD fluoromethyl ketone (Kamiya Biomedical), a tripeptide inhibitor of ICE and related proteases (25Fearnhead H.O. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), then treated with 100 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody as described. Measurements of cytochrome oxidase-dependent oxygen uptake after an additional 90 min showed that the ICE inhibitor protected cells against Fas-mediated inactivation of cytochrome c (Fig. 8). These results indicate that an antecedent proteolytic event was needed for inactivation of electron transport through cytochrome oxidase. To ascertain whether a component in the cytosol of the apoptotic cells was responsible for the effect of apoptosis on cytochrome c, cytosol from Jurkat cells treated for 60-120 min with anti-Fas antibody was added to digitonin-permeabilized control cells (Fig. 9). Cytosol from Fas-treated cells effected an inhibition of cytochrome oxidase-dependent oxygen consumption that was apparent after a preincubation of 5-20 min; cytosol from control cells had no effect on oxygen consumption. The inactivation of electron transport by the cytosolic factor could be reversed by the addition of cytochrome c, indicating that, as in the previous experiments, cytochrome c was inactivated and cytochrome oxidase was spared. We evaluated the mitochondrial membrane potential using the fluorescent probe di-OC6(3), which is retained in mitochondria with a normal membrane potential. CCCP was used to fully discharge the membrane potential before dye loading in the negative control. Untreated cells demonstrated a mean value (in arbitrary fluorescence units) of 24.6. Fas ligation led to a slow decline in fluorescence (Fig. 10) consistent with partial loss of mitochondrial membrane potential during apoptosis. The decline in mitochondrial function observed in our studies and reported from other laboratories is one of several potentially fatal functional alterations that take place in apoptotic cells. An issue often raised in connection with apoptosis has to do with which one of these lethal changes is the change that is actually responsible for the death of the cell. The role of executioner is usually assigned to the earliest of the lethal changes observed to take place in the dying cell. To the extent that any of several events that take place during apoptosis has the potential to kill the cell, however, this issue is difficult to settle. It may be that, rather than dying by a single stroke of the sword, a cell undergoing apoptosis actually suffers “the death of a thousand cuts” (26Tan A. The Joy Luck Club. G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York1989: 102Google Scholar). The findings obtained with Z-VAD fluoromethyl ketone suggest that the loss of cytochrome c activity during apoptosis involves a step dependent on a death protease. The death protease could have either of two effects: 1) the direct proteolytic inactivation of the cytochrome, or 2) the proteolytic release of a cytochrome c inhibitor. From the results of spectrophotometry, extensive degradation of the cytochrome seems unlikely. Limited proteolysis, however, could alter one of the sites through which cytochrome c binds to other cytochromes, or could change the environment of the heme, altering its redox potential (for example) so that it could no longer carry electrons between cytochrome c1 and cytochrome oxidase. Such a proteolytic alteration could be accomplished by one of the death proteases or by another protease released through the action of a death protease. As to inhibitors, a precedent exists in the form of IF1, a small mitochondrial polypeptide that inhibits the ATPase activity of Complex V when the potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane is low (27Hashimoto T.

This regulatory polypeptide prevents the destruction of ATP that would otherwise occur if for some reason the mitochondrial transmembrane potential should transiently collapse (28Mimura H. Hashimoto T. Yoshida Y. Ichikawa N. Tagawa K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 350-354Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c is located in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, raising the question as to how a cytosolic cytochrome c antagonist could reach its target. The antagonist may be generated directly in the intermembrane space during the course of apoptosis, appearing in the cytosol as a result of leakage through the outer mitochondrial membrane. Alternatively, it may be formed in the cytosol, then move to the intermembrane space to exert its effect. In either case, these results suggest that the outer mitochondrial membrane, although appearing intact by electron microscopy, allows the cytochrome c antagonist to pass through, either via a specific carrier or through an alteration in its lipid composition. The anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 is located in the outer membrane of mitochondria, with a portion extending into the intermembrane space. The mechanism by which members of the Bcl-2 family affect apoptosis is not known, and it has been a particular puzzle why Bcl-2 is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, rather than in the inner mitochondrial membrane where the electron transport complexes and the ATP-synthesizing enzyme are found. Our observation that the apoptosis program can destroy the activity of cytochrome c, a resident of the intermembrane space, indicates that during the execution of that program, events occur in that location that could in principle be influenced by the Bcl-2 associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. A further point of interest is our finding that the mitochondria retain much of their transmembrane potential even after oxygen uptake has been completely abolished. The mitochondrial transmembrane potential is generated by the transport of protons out of the mitochondrial matrix during electron transport, and would therefore be expected to collapse with the cessation of electron transport as the excess protons flow back into the matrix through the mitochondrial ATPase (Complex V). The finding that mitochondria in apoptotic cells retain a portion of their transmembrane potential raises the possibility that, like cytochrome c, the mitochondrial ATPase is also defunctionalized in some way as cells undergo apoptosis. The function of other mitochondrial elements may also be abrogated during apoptosis. Complex III, as a hypothetical example, could be inactivated through an effect on the Rieske protein, which extends into the intermembrane space (35Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electron transport abnormalities yet to be demonstrated may account for the discrepancy in time between the early fall in oxygen uptake and the somewhat later decline in cytochrome c function in cells undergoing apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W1999344986,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), also known as vascular permeability factor, is strongly expressed by epidermal keratinocytes during wound healing, in psoriasis, and in bullous diseases such as erythema multiforme and bullous pemphigoid. All of these disorders are characterized by increased microvascular permeability and angiogenesis. Since the development of erythema as a result of hyperpermeable blood vessels is also a common feature after excess sun exposure, we speculated about an up-regulation of VEGF expression by ultraviolet (UV) light. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of UVB irradiation on VEGF expression in cultured keratinocytes. Thereby we found a large increase in VEGF mRNA and protein levels upon irradiation of quiescent keratinocytes with sublethal and physiologically relevant doses of UVB. Although H2O2 was also a potent inducer of VEGF expression, the effect of UVB irradiation is unlikely to be mediated by reactive oxygen species as determined by the use of antioxidants. Further experiments revealed that the UVB-induced overexpression of VEGF is dependent on de novo protein synthesis and might occur via release of soluble mediators, which subsequently turn on VEGF expression. In summary, our results suggest a novel role of VEGF in the induction of erythema after excess sun exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1619312125,"Current models for agonist-activated Ca2+ entry in nonexcitable cells focus on the capacitative mechanism where entry is activated as a downstream result of the sustained depletion of agonist-sensitive stores without any direct requirement for inositol phosphates. This mechanism has been shown to be important for the sustained Ca2+ signals seen in a variety of nonexcitable cells under conditions of maximal stimulation. In contrast, relatively little attention has been given to Ca2+ entry under more physiological levels of agonist where, for example, oscillating Ca2+ responses are common.

We now report that activation of this novel noncapacitative Ca2+ entry is via a distinct signaling pathway involving an agonist-induced, phospholipase A2-mediated generation of arachidonic acid. The agonist-induced entry of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium is a key component in the cytosolic Ca2+ signals that link activation of various receptors on the cell surface with the initiation and control of cell function. Despite some continued controversy, models for such Ca2+ entry in nonexcitable cells currently focus on the so-called capacitative mechanism where the sustained depletion of agonist-sensitive Ca2+ stores is both necessary and sufficient to activate entry (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar, 2Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). This capacitative mechanism of Ca2+ entry activation has been shown to be important for the sustained Ca2+ signals seen in a variety of nonexcitable cells under conditions of maximal stimulation, and recently, direct electrophysiological measurements of a Ca2+-selective current that is specifically activated by depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores have been made (3Hoth M.

Current models for these phenomena generally emphasize special properties and modifications of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate[Ca2+]iintracellular free calcium ion concentrationPLA2phospholipase A2PLCphospholipase CBAPTA1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidPLAPPLA2-activating protein. -induced Ca2+ release, and Ca2+ entry is assumed to play only a relatively minor role. This assumption is contradicted by our recent findings using cells from the exocrine avian nasal gland where we showed that such patterns of [Ca2+]i signaling do not depend exclusively on the generated levels of InsP3 but also, critically, on the activation of Ca2+ entry which acts by regulating the InsP3-mediated liberation of intracellular Ca2+ from agonist-sensitive stores (10Martin S.C. Shuttleworth T.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies examining the nature of agonist-activated Ca2+ entry under these conditions (12Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) revealed that it demonstrates properties that are incompatible with current versions of the capacitative model. Specifically, (a) activation of this entry pathway is critically dependent on agonist occupation of the receptor but independent of the status of agonist-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores; (b) entry (measured as the rate of Mn2+ quench) is independent of the cyclical emptying and refilling of the agonist-sensitive Ca2+ pool during oscillations; and (c) on initial exposure to low agonist concentrations, activation of Ca2+ entry precedes any detectable release of Ca2+ from the stores. inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate intracellular free calcium ion concentration phospholipase A2 phospholipase C 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid PLA2-activating protein. The novel finding that agonist-induced Ca2+ entry during [Ca2+]i oscillations is noncapacitative raises the question of the nature of the signaling pathway responsible for its activation. Recently, it has been reported that the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations in pancreatic acini by agonists acting at the high affinity cholecystokinin receptor involves a phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-mediated formation of arachidonic acid (13Tsunoda Y. Owyang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1194-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Tsunoda Y. Owyang C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G435-G444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise role of the generated arachidonic acid was not determined in these studies, our demonstration that carbachol-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in the avian nasal gland cells are acutely dependent on the noncapacitative entry of Ca2+ (10Martin S.C. Shuttleworth T.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) suggested that this entry could be a potential target for arachidonic acid generated as a result of agonist action. We now present evidence confirming that indeed the control of the novel noncapacitative Ca2+ entry during oscillations involves a PLA2-mediated generation of arachidonic acid. As carbachol-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in these cells require both the generation of InsP3 and the arachidonate-mediated Ca2+ entry, we conclude that the successful initiation and maintenance of an oscillatory [Ca2+]i response involves a combined and coordinated activation of a PLC and a PLA2. The methods used for the isolation of cells from the nasal glands of 6-10-day-old domestic ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos), their loading with the fluorescent probe indo-1, and subsequent microfluorometric measurements in individual cells were as described previously (10Martin S.C. Shuttleworth T.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Shuttleworth T.J. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Changes in [Ca2+]i in single individual cells were determined as the ratio of the emitted fluorescence, measured as photon counts, at 405 and 485 nm with excitation at 350 nm, corrected for background and autofluorescence online. The simultaneous determination of fluorescence ratio and Mn2+ quench in individual cells was essentially as described previously (16Shuttleworth T.J. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, this involves the summing of the two emitted fluorescences which are factored such that the resulting adjusted total fluorescence is independent of [Ca2+]. Determination of the required factor is performed for each individual cell at the beginning of the experiment by observing the effects of induced oscillatory changes in [Ca2+]i, in the absence of extracellular Mn2+. Determinations of arachidonic acid generation followed standard techniques (17Felder C.C. Kanterman R.Y. Ma A.L. Axelrod J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20356-20362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hunt T.W. Carroll R.C. Peralta E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29565-29570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated cells were plated into a six-well culture plate and incubated in L-15 culture medium for 1 h, after which nonadherent cells were removed by washing with fresh medium. [3H]Arachidonic acid (0.5 µCi/ml, American Radiochemicals) was added and the cells incubated for 20-24 h at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. The wells containing the labeled cells were then washed three times with saline containing 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (to act as a sink for released arachidonic acid). Agonists and/or inhibitors were added as appropriate and the released arachidonic acid determined by liquid scintillation counting of samples of the supernatant medium. Counts released were normalized to the total counts in the cells, determined by solubilization of the cells in each well with 1.5 M NaOH and counting of the resulting solution. Cellular levels of InsP3 were determined in preparations of dispersed nasal gland cells using a commercial radiolabeled binding assay (Amersham) as described previously (19Shuttleworth T.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid, isotetrandrine, PLA2-activating protein (PLAP)-peptide, indomethacin, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid were all obtained from Biomol. Demonstration that muscarinic receptor activation is coupled to the generation of arachidonic acid was carried out in cells loaded overnight with [3H]arachidonic acid. Addition of the muscarinic agonist carbachol to these cells resulted in a marked increase in the release of arachidonic acid to the medium (Fig. 1A). Obviously, the observed increase in arachidonic acid release may simply reflect a secondary or downstream effect of muscarinic receptor activation rather than a direct effect. For example, the addition of carbachol will result in the elevation of [Ca2+]i, and this could activate a PLA2 resulting in the release of arachidonic acid. To examine whether the release of arachidonic acid was dependent on (i.e. secondary to) the simultaneous rise in [Ca2+]i, the effect of carbachol was determined in cells preloaded with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA. Cells were loaded with BAPTA by incubation with the acetoxymethyl ester form (BAPTA-AM) sufficient to completely abolish all [Ca2+]i responses to the addition of carbachol (Fig. 1B). Examination of the carbachol-induced release of arachidonic acid in such cells revealed that it was unaffected (Fig. 1A). Although such findings do not exclude a possible additional Ca2+-dependent activation of arachidonic acid release, they do indicate that an agonist-induced increase in [Ca2+]i is not a necessary prerequisite for the activation induced by carbachol. In individual avian nasal gland cells loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorophore indo-1, simple addition of a low concentration (2-5 µM) of exogenous arachidonic acid to otherwise unstimulated cells induced a marked increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2A). This reflects an arachidonate-activated entry of Ca2+ because virtually no increase in [Ca2+]i was seen in a nominally Ca2+-free medium (estimated [Ca2+] = approximately 10 µM) (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, simultaneous measurement of the rate of Mn2+ quenching showed that this increased dramatically on addition of exogenous arachidonic acid (Fig. 2C). This increase in Ca2+ entry did not result from a generalized increase in ionic permeability, however, as whole cell perforated patch-clamp measurements (20Martin S.C. Shuttleworth T.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 426: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in current clamp mode showed that the overall cell membrane potential was maintained in the presence of 5 µM arachidonic acid (data not shown). It should also be noted that the activation of this Ca2+ entry appears to be acutely sensitive to arachidonic acid as the concentrations employed here are some 10-fold lower than those commonly used to demonstrate arachidonate-induced effects on, for example, K+ channels in smooth muscle cells (21Ordway R.W. Walsh Jr., J.V. Singer J.J. Science. 1989; 244: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Importantly, the concentrations used are significantly lower than those reported to induce the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores in certain cells (22Chow S.C. Jondal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 902-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wu L. Katz S. Brown G.R. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 228-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and no such mobilization could be detected in our cells at any of the concentrations of arachidonic acid used here. It has been reported recently that the [Ca2+]i oscillations and amylase secretion induced by agonists acting at high affinity cholecystokinin receptors in pancreatic acinar cells, processes believed to involve the PLA2-mediated generation of arachidonic acid (13Tsunoda Y. Owyang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1194-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Tsunoda Y. Owyang C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G435-G444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), can be inhibited by the biscoclaurine (bisbenzylisoquinoline) alkaloid isotetrandrine (24Tsunoda Y. Owyang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of isotetrandrine on the oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals induced by low concentrations of carbachol in individual indo-loaded nasal gland cells. Addition of isotetrandrine (10 µM) resulted in an immediate, yet readily reversible, inhibition of the carbachol-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations (Fig. 3A). The inhibitory effect we observed on [Ca2+]i oscillations closely resembles that seen when Ca2+ entry is reduced by depolarization of the cell in a high K+ medium (Fig. 3B), suggesting that isotetrandrine may also be inhibiting Ca2+ entry. Consistent with this, we found that the inhibition of oscillations by isotetrandrine was associated with a marked reduction of the simultaneous rate of Mn2+ entry measured as the quenching of intracellular indo-1 (Fig. 3C). We have shown previously that the initiation of [Ca2+]i oscillations by carbachol in these cells is associated with an enhanced rate of Mn2+ quenching of intracellular indo-1 (10Martin S.C. Shuttleworth T.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although there are several potential problems in the use of the Mn2+ technique as an indicator of Ca2+ entry, it is clear that an agonist-induced change in the quench rate must reflect at least some component of divalent cation entry (12Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and that this entry is inhibited by isotetrandrine. In marked contrast to its effects on oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals, isotetrandrine was completely without effect on the sustained [Ca2+]i signal generated by higher concentrations of carbachol (Fig. 4A). It is well established that these sustained elevations in [Ca2+]i reflect the capacitative entry of Ca2+, and they are abolished readily by agents known to inhibit Ca2+ entry such as lanthanum, or SK&F 96365, or simply by reducing the driving force for Ca2+ entry (for example by depolarizing the cell membrane by exposure to a high K+ medium). Capacitative entry activated as a result of store depletion by thapsigargin (0.5 µM) was similarly unaffected by isotetrandrine (Fig. 4B). As a further test of the inability of isotetrandrine to affect capacitative Ca2+ entry, we examined whether the drug had any influence on the the refilling of agonist-sensitive Ca2+ stores following their discharge with a high agonist concentration. The ability of the stores to refill was determined by examining the magnitude of the [Ca2+]i spikes induced by paired exposures to 10 µM carbachol spaced approximately 200 s apart. In the continued presence of isotetrandrine, the magnitudes of the two [Ca2+]i spikes induced by the addition of a high concentration of carbachol were virtually identical, indicating that the refilling of the agonist-sensitive stores in the period between the two carbachol exposures was unimpaired (Fig. 4C). As refilling of the agonist-sensitive stores is known to depend on capacitative entry of Ca2+, the absence of any effect of isotetrandrine on this process confirms that it is without effect on this pathway. It should also be noted that these data demonstrate that isotetrandrine is without any obvious influence on [Ca2+]i in unstimulated cells, and preexposure to the drug does not affect the InsP3-induced release of Ca2+. We conclude that the observed effects of isotetrandrine on [Ca2+]i oscillations appear to result from specific effects on the noncapacitative entry of Ca2+, which we have previously shown to be critical for agonist-induced oscillations (10Martin S.C. Shuttleworth T.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Isotetrandrine and its related biscoclaurine alkaloids are known to produce many different effects in various cell types (see 25 and references therein). However, studies have revealed that at the low micromolar concentrations employed here, these diverse actions can generally be ascribed to either effects on voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (specifically by interacting at the benzothiazipine binding site) (26Felix J.P. King V.F. Shevell J.L. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Bick I.R.C. Slaughter R.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11793-11800Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or to effects on the activation of a PLA2 and the subsequent generation of arachidonic acid (25Akiba S. Kato E. Sato T. Fujii T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Hashizume T. Yamaguchi H. Sato T. Fujii T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In common with most nonexcitable cells, voltage-operated Ca2+ channels are absent in avian nasal gland cells. Nevertheless, it was considered possible that isotetrandrine might be interacting with a benzothiazipine-like site on a putative non-voltage-operated Ca2+ channel. However, the classic benzothiazipine receptor antagonist diltiazem was completely without effect on the carbachol-induced oscillations in [Ca2+]i (data not shown). In contrast, an action on PLA2 activity was indicated by the demonstration that isotetrandrine (10 µM) significantly inhibited the effect of carbachol on the release of arachidonic acid from cells preloaded with [3H]arachidonic acid (Fig. 5A). In contrast to its effects on arachidonic acid release, isotetrandrine was completely without effect on the carbachol-induced increase in InsP3 levels inside the cell (Fig. 5B). This confirms that the inhibition of [Ca2+]i oscillations by isotetrandrine did not result from effects on carbachol-induced increases in PLC activity and inositol phosphate generation. This finding is consistent with the above noted inability of isotetrandrine to affect either InsP3-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 4C) or the sustained capacitative [Ca2+]i signals induced by high agonist concentrations (Fig. 4A). A similar conclusion has been reported previously for the related drug tetrandrine in studies on adrenal glomerulosa cells (28Rossier M.F. Python C.P. Capponi A.M. Schlegel W. Kwan C.Y. Vallotton M.B. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1035-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that these data further indicate that the isotetrandrine-sensitive generation of arachidonic acid induced by carbachol is unlikely to originate from a combined action of a PLC-mediated production of diacylglycerol from inositol-containing phospholipids followed by the action of a diacylglycerol lipase to produce arachidonic acid (29Dixon J.F. Hokin L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14418-14425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This, again, supports the suggestion that the observed effects of isotetrandrine involve an action on a PLA2. As further evidence for a role in the inhibition of PLA2, we found that the inhibition of [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by isotetrandrine could be reversed by simple addition of low concentrations of exogenous arachidonic acid (2-5 µM) despite the continued presence of isotetrandrine (Fig. 6A). Significantly, the observed range of exogenous arachidonic acid concentrations required to reverse the isotetrandrine-induced inhibition of oscillations is identical to those shown previously to activate Ca2+ entry directly in unstimulated cells (Fig. 2) and are 10-40 times less than those reported in other cell types to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ pools or to induce a nonspecific permeabilization of the cell membrane. Although the precise manner in which isotetrandrine affects PLA2 activity is unclear, previous reports have shown that it acts by uncoupling the PLA2 from an activating G protein rather than any direct effects on the enzyme itself (25Akiba S. Kato E. Sato T. Fujii T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consistent with this proposed mode of action, we found that the isotetrandrine-induced inhibition of oscillations could also be reversed by a small peptide that forms part of the recently cloned PLA2-activating protein (30Clark M.A. Özgür L.E. Conway T.M. Dispoto J. Crooke S.T. Bomalaski J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5418-5422Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B). PLAP was originally isolated based on its sequence homology with the bee venom protein melittin, and the PLAP-peptide has been shown to stimulate PLA2 activity in a variety of cells including intact pancreatic acinar cells (24Tsunoda Y. Owyang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and synovial cells (31Bomalaski J.S. Fallon M. Turner R.A. Crooke S.T. Meunier P.C. Clark M.A. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1990; 116: 814-825PubMed Google Scholar). It seems likely that the observed ability of PLAP-peptide to activate PLA2 in intact cells results from its insertion into the membrane as its sequence includes several hydrophobic residues (30Clark M.A. Özgür L.E. Conway T.M. Dispoto J. Crooke S.T. Bomalaski J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5418-5422Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Whatever its precise mode of action, these data clearly support the hypothesis that the observed action of isotetrandrine on the carbachol-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations involves effects on PLA2 activity. Finally, we examined whether the observed effects of arachidonic acid on the activation of the noncapacitative Ca2+ entry during [Ca2+]i oscillations were directly dependent on the fatty acid itself rather than any products of arachidonic acid oxidation. We found that addition of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 µM) failed to affect the [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by low concentrations of carbachol (Fig. 7A). In contrast, inhibition of the lipoxygenase pathway by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (10 µM) resulted in the gradual transition of oscillations into a sustained elevated [Ca2+]i signal (Fig. 7B). We interpret these data as indicating that the noncapacitative Ca2+ entry pathway during oscillations is likely regulated by arachidonic acid itself rather than any products of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase pathways. The effect of nordihydroguaiaretic acid can be explained if the principal route for arachidonic acid breakdown is via the lipoxygenase pathway. Inhibition of this pathway by nordihydroguaiaretic acid in a carbachol-stimulated cell would then result in the accumulation of arachidonic acid, enhancing Ca2+ entry sufficiently to generate a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i. Together, these results demonstrate that the agonist-induced, noncapacitative entry of Ca2+ during [Ca2+]i oscillations, which we have shown to play a critical role in driving the oscillations, involves the action of arachidonic acid generated as a result of the activation of a PLA2. Specifically we have shown that (a) muscarinic receptor agonists activate the generation and release of arachidonic acid; (b) this activation was independent of agonist-induced changes in [Ca2+]i and InsP3 levels; (c) inhibition of this activation immediately stopped the noncapacitative Ca2+ entry during oscillations but was entirely without effect on capacitative entry; (d) inhibition of the noncapacitative Ca2+ entry during oscillations could be reversed by addition of low concentrations of exogenous arachidonic acid or by direct activation of PLA2; and (e) addition of the same low concentrations of exogenous arachidonic acid to otherwise unstimulated cells is capable of activating Ca2+ entry. It is now known that there are several types of PLA2, but they can be classified broadly into two structurally and functionally distinct groups: secretory PLA2 (sPLA2) and cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) (32Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the observed effects of isotetrandrine on [Ca2+]i oscillations result from its influence on an agonist-activated PLA2, then clearly this is likely to be a member of the cPLA2 group which includes both Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent enzymes (32Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the PLA2 in nasal gland cells is, however, unknown, and the precise mechanism by which it is activated is unclear. The fact that it does not depend secondarily on the agonist-induced increase in [Ca2+]i suggests that it may be coupled fairly directly to receptor activation, and as such it is possible that the activation involves a distinct PLA2-coupled G protein. However, we have shown previously that the continued oscillatory signal requires the combined action of increases in InsP3 and Ca2+ entry, and we know that the activation of PLC in these cells involves a Gq-type G protein (33Hildebrandt J.-P. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 133: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Hence, one way in which such a combined response could be coordinated would be for both actions to be mediated through the same receptor-G protein complex, perhaps via independent actions of the Gα and Gβγ subunits. Such a putative mechanism is not without precedence as Gβγ subunits have been shown to have several direct effects in various systems (34Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), including the activation of PLA2 (35Jelsema C.L. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3623-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 36Kim D. Lewis D.L. Graziadei L. Neer E.J. Bar-Sagi D. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1989; 337: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). As noted above, the isotetrandrine-induced inhibition of PLA2 is believed to result from the uncoupling of PLA2 from an activating G protein rather than any direct effects on the enzyme itself (25Akiba S. Kato E. Sato T. Fujii T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); and in at least one case (pancreatic acinar cells), it has been proposed that this activation involves the βγ subunits of the PLC-activating G protein Gq (24Tsunoda Y. Owyang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this context, it is particularly intriguing that the PLAP that we have shown to be able to reverse the isotetrandrine-induced inhibition of oscillations shows marked sequence similarity to the β subunits of G proteins (37Peitsch M.C. Borner C. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 292-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Finally, our studies have shown that the biscoclaurine alkaloid isotetrandrine is an effective and readily reversible inhibitor of the noncapacitative entry of Ca2+ seen during agonist-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations, but it is without effect on the capacitative Ca2+ entry induced by high concentrations of an agonist or by thapsigargin. Significantly, this further confirms the existence of a distinct noncapacitative mechanism of activation of agonist-enhanced Ca2+ entry during [Ca2+]i oscillations and provides a new means of specifically blocking this pathway. However, it must be emphasized that all indications suggest that isotetrandrine is acting by interfering with the mechanism of activation of the entry pathway and not with the pathway itself. It remains possible, therefore, that a single entry pathway may be activated by both capacitative and noncapacitative mechanisms. In this context it is interesting that it has been suggested that capacitative activation of Ca2+ entry may involve a GTP-dependent step requiring the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP such as might be mediated by a so-called small G protein (38Fasolato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20737-20740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bird G. St J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21486-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reported participation of arachidonic acid in the regulation of such small G proteins (15Chuang T.-H. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26206-26211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Ligeti E. Pizon V. Wittinghofer A. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) may indicate that they provide the common link for both capacitative and noncapacitative mechanisms of agonist-induced activation of Ca2+ entry.

When the T cell receptor recognizes a foreign antigen presented in the context of the major histocompatibility complex class I, the CTL induces apoptotic cell death in the target cell through one of two distinct mechanisms: Fas-based and granule-mediated cytotoxicity. During granule-mediated killing, T cell receptor activation leads to the induction of function-related genes, including perforin and the granzymes. These are packaged into granules, which are then mobilized to the surface of the CTL that is adjacent to the target cell. Exocytosis of CTL granule contents into the intercellular space between CTL and target cell allows perforin, a pore-forming protein found in the granules (2Podack E.R. Curr. Topics Microbiol.

These enzymes can be divided into three subfamilies: the ICE-like enzymes (ICE, TX/Ich-2/ICErelII, and ICErelIII), the CPP32-like proteases (CPP32, Ced-3, Mch2, and Mch3/CMH-1/ICE-LAP3), and the Nedd-2 proteins (Nedd-2 and Ich-1L). Each of these proteases is synthesized as an inactive precursor requiring cleavage after Asp residues for activation. When the ICE proteases were first discovered, it was postulated that granzyme B, which has substrate specificity requiring an Asp at P1 (32Murphy M.E.P. Moult J. Bleackley R.C. Gershenfeld H.

Strasser A. Cell. 1994; 76: 777-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Although we found no evidence that granzyme B could cleave and activate ICE (35Darmon A.J. Ehrman N. Caputo A. Fujinaga J. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32043-32046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have recently shown that CPP32 is an intracellular substrate both in vitro and in vivo for granzyme B (36Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Other workers have shown that granzyme B can cleave the CPP32-related protease CMH-1/Mch3/ICE-LAP3 in vitro (37Gu Y. Sarnecki C. Fleming M.A. Lippke J.A. Bleackley R.C. Su M.S.-S. J. Biol.

CPP32 (putative cysteine protease of 32 kDa) was identified as the protease responsible for cleavage of the nuclear protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase during the induction of apoptosis (30Nicholson D.W.

Here we examine the ability of cytotoxic cells derived from mice deficient in granzyme B to induce CPP32 cleavage and apoptosis in target cells. Additionally, we use a peptide inhibitor of CPP32 to study its role in target cell DNA fragmentation. Our data demonstrate that CPP32 is cleaved and activated by granzyme B during CTL-mediated cytotoxicity in vivo. Furthermore, this pathway appears to be particularly relevant to DNA fragmentation rather than membrane damage. Mice homozygous for a null mutation in the granzyme B gene have been previously described (12Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Cytotoxic cells from these mice (GB KO) and from control mice (GB WT) were generated as follows. Splenocytes from these mice were activated in primary mixed lymphocyte cultures in the presence of IL-2 using irradiated splenocytes from Balb/c (H-2d) mice as stimulators for 3 days. Dead cells were removed by sedimentation through a Ficoll/metrizoate gradient. CTL21.9 is a cloned cytotoxic T cell line that requires antigenic stimulation (irradiated Balb/c splenocytes) and is dependent on IL-2 (39Garner R. Helgason C.D. Atkinson E.A. Pinkoski M.J. Ostergaard H.L. Sorensen O. Fu A. Lapchak P.H. Rabinovitch A. McElhaney J.E. Berke G. Bleackley R.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5413-5421PubMed Google Scholar). All of the above cells lines were stimulated on a 7-day cycle with irradiated Balb/c splenocytes and were maintained in RPMI 640 supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 µM β-mercaptoethanol (RHFM) containing 60 units/ml recombinant IL-2. Effector cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody (2C11, 1:500 dilution) for 24 h prior to cytotoxicity assays. The L1210 (H-2d) variant transfected with mouse Fas cDNA (L1210-Fas) was kindly provided by Dr. Pierre Golstein, Centre d'Immunologie INSERM-CNRS de Marseille-Luminy, Marseille, France (40Rouvier E. Luciani M.-F. Golstein P. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). EL4 (H-2b) and YAC-1 (H-2a) mouse lymphomas and P815 (H-2d) mastocytoma cells were maintained by continuous culture in RHFM. Cytolytic activity, assessed by measuring 51Cr from labeled target cells, and DNA fragmentation, assessed by measuring [3H]thymidine release, were as described previously (39Garner R. Helgason C.D. Atkinson E.A. Pinkoski M.J. Ostergaard H.L. Sorensen O. Fu A. Lapchak P.H. Rabinovitch A. McElhaney J.E. Berke G. Bleackley R.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5413-5421PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, targets were labeled with 51Cr (DuPont NEN) for 1 h at 37°C or with [3H]thymidine (DuPont NEN) for 24 h at 37°C prior to the assays. Labeled targets were incubated with CTL21.9, GB KO, or GB WT effector cells at an effector to target ratio of 5:1 in a total volume of 200 µl in 96-well V-bottom plates for 2 h for preliminary studies or 4 h for inhibitor studies at 37°C. ConA was added to assays containing EL4, YAC-1, or L1210-Fas cells to a final concentration of 2 µg/ml. Ac-DEVD-CHO was used at a final concentration of 40 µM. CTL activity was calculated using the following formula: % lysis = 100 × (sample - spontaneous release)/(total - spontaneous release). Spontaneous release was determined by incubation of targets in the absence of CTL. Target cells (106) were incubated with appropriate numbers of effector cells at 37°C for 4 h, and then all cells were lysed in 10 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) CHAPS, 5 mM dithiothreitol. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and then the entire lysate was resolved using 12% polyacrylamide SDS gels. Proteins were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride and then probed using an antibody directed against the p17 subunit of CPP32. Detection was by probing with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Corp.). Recent work on apoptosis has focused on the role of the ICE/ced-3 cysteine proteases. We are specifically interested in the role of these proteases during CTL-mediated cytotoxicity. Initial studies of ICE proteases suggested that ICE itself could be a key mediator of apoptotic cell death (17Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar); however, studies of mice lacking ICE revealed that ICE does not play a nonredundant role in apoptosis (18Li P. Allen H. Banerjee S. Franklin S. Herzog L. Johnston C. McDowell J. Paskind M. Rodman L. Salfeld J. Towne E. Tracey D. Wardwell S. Wei F.-Y. Wong W. Kamen R. Seshadri T. Cell. 1995; 80: 401-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have shown that ICE does not act as a substrate for granzyme B (35Darmon A.J. Ehrman N. Caputo A. Fujinaga J. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32043-32046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a CTL-specific serine protease that is required for the early induction of target cell DNA fragmentation (10Shi L. Kraut R.P. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 12Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that granzyme B cleaves and activates the proteases CPP32 and CMH-1/Mch3/ICE-LAP3 during granule-mediated killing (36Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 37Gu Y. Sarnecki C. Fleming M.A. Lippke J.A. Bleackley R.C. Su M.S.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10816-10820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To further study the role of CPP32 during granule-based CTL-mediated cytotoxicity, we first generated cytolytic cells from mice homozygous for a null mutation in the granzyme B gene (GB KO) or from control mice (GB WT). Previous studies using these mice have reported that DNA fragmentation is markedly decreased when effectors lacking granzyme B are used in comparison with control cells (12Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 13Shresta S. MacIvor D.M. Heusel J.W. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5679-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In order to confirm these results using our cell lines, we used 51Cr release (as a measure of membrane integrity) and [3H]thymidine release (as a measure of DNA fragmentation) from labeled YAC-1, EL4, P815, or L1210-Fas (a variant of L1210 transfected with the murine Fas cDNA) target cells as indicators of cytolytic activity. Fig. 1 confirms that the GB KO cells are clearly deficient at inducing DNA fragmentation in susceptible target cells when compared with control cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast, there is no apparent difference in induction of 51Cr release between these cells lines (Fig. 1A). The cytolytic activity (measured as 51Cr release) of these cells was reduced from 65 to 5% in the presence of EGTA, confirming that these cells kill predominantly through the granule pathway (data not shown). We then assessed the ability of each of these effector cells to induce cleavage of CPP32 in target cells. Effector and target cells were combined at an effector to target ratio of 5:1 for 4 h at 37°C, and then all cells were lysed. Lysates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and CPP32 was detected using an antibody directed against the large subunit of CPP32. The results of this study using EL4 and YAC-1 target cells are shown in Fig. 2 and indicate that CPP32 is not cleaved during CTL-mediated cytotoxicity in the absence of granzyme B (GB KO lanes). In contrast, CPP32 is completely cleaved to the active p17/p12 subunits in target cells exposed to control effectors (GB WT lanes, Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained using P815 cells as targets (data not shown). These results clearly show that granzyme B is required for the cleavage and activation of CPP32 during CTL-mediated cytotoxicity and confirm our previous finding that CPP32 may be an intracellular substrate for granzyme B (36Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). If the incubation time of targets with effectors was increased to 24 h, CPP32 still was not cleaved in target cells in the absence of granzyme B (data not shown), further confirming that no other granzyme can substitute for this activity. Together, our results suggest that granzyme B is involved in inducing target cell DNA fragmentation through the cleavage and activation of CPP32 (and probably CPP32-like proteases). To further test this hypothesis, we used the peptide inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO, which has previously been shown to inhibit CPP32 (30Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2737-2742PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it might inhibit all CPP32-like proteases. In contrast, Ac-DEVD-CHO cannot inhibit ICE (30Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar). In these studies, 51Cr and [3H]thymidine release from labeled L1210-Fas cells was measured in the presence or the absence of this inhibitor, using the cytotoxic T cell clone CTL21.9 (which kills using the granule pathway) as effector. The results of this study are shown in Fig. 3. Similar results were obtained using EL4 and YAC-1 as targets (data not shown). Although Ac-DEVD-CHO has no apparent effect on 51Cr release from labeled targets (Fig. 3A), it dramatically reduced [3H]thymidine release (Fig. 3B) from 75 to 8% in this study. These results cannot be due to inhibition of granzyme B itself. Using [35S]Met-labeled CPP32 precursor as an indicator of granzyme B activity, we found that the presence of 200 µM of this inhibitor with granzyme B in an in vitro cleavage assay failed to suppress granzyme B activity (data not shown). Having established that Ac-DEVD-CHO affects only [3H]thymidine release and not 51Cr release, we wondered whether ICE-like proteases also contribute to target cell DNA fragmentation and/or membrane damage. In these studies we used the prototypic ICE inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO. This inhibitor has been shown to inhibit ICE (15Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J.

Our results demonstrate that ICE-like proteases appear to play no role in the induction of target cell DNA fragmentation during granule-mediated killing. In a comparison between the effects of Ac-DEVD-CHO and Ac-YVAD-CHO on [3H]thymidine release from labeled targets, we found no inhibition by Ac-YVAD-CHO, even at the highest concentration used (100 µM, Fig. 4). However, Ac-DEVD-CHO had a striking effect on [3H]thymidine release, with maximal inhibition achieved by 50 µM but clear inhibition even at 5 µM (Fig. 4). These results suggest that ICE-like proteases play no role in the induction of target cell DNA fragmentation, whereas CPP32-like proteases are required for this process. We also found that ICE-like proteases play no role in the induction of target cell membrane damage. Ac-YVAD-CHO exerted no effect on 51Cr release from labeled targets when used in the assay at 40 µM (data not shown). These results are consistent with those of other workers who showed that inhibition of macrophage ICE activity by YVAD-chloromethylketone as demonstrated by suppression of mature IL-1β release had no effect on 51Cr release in response to CTL attack (41Nett-Fiordalisi M. Tomaselli K.J. Russell J.H. Chaplin D.D. J. Leuk. Biol. 1995; 58: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Taken together, these inhibitor studies suggest the involvement of CPP32-like but not ICE-like proteases in the induction of DNA fragmentation during granule-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, neither of these protease families appears to play a significant role in the induction of membrane damage following CTL attack. In conclusion, we have confirmed that CPP32 is probably an intracellular substrate for granzyme B, and we have shown that this represents a nonredundant role for granzyme B. Additionally, the reduced ability of effector cells lacking granzyme B to induce rapid target cell DNA fragmentation can be accounted for by the failure of these cells to cleave and activate CPP32 or a CPP32-like protease because inhibition by Ac-DEVD-CHO also reduces target cell DNA fragmentation. However, neither the use of effector cells lacking granzyme B nor the presence of the CPP32 inhibitor had a significant effect on membrane damage, suggesting that both granzyme B and CPP32 are primarily involved in DNA fragmentation during CTL-induced apoptosis. The lack of effect of Ac-YVAD-CHO on either 51Cr or [3H]thymidine release seems to suggest that ICE-like proteases are not required for granule-mediated cytotoxicity. It has recently been shown that during Fas-mediated killing, ICE-like proteases may be responsible for the activation of CPP32-like proteases (42Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that during granule-mediated killing, granzyme B replaces the function of ICE-like proteases by directly activating the CPP32 proteins. Because DNA fragmentation proceeds in the absence of granzyme B (Fig. 1) and in the absence of CPP32-like activity (Fig. 3, Fig. 4), albeit with reduced efficiency, this suggests an alternate route to DNA fragmentation that does not involve CPP32-like proteins, possibly mediated by other granzymes.

To investigate the mechanism by which integrins mediate the activation of MAP kinases upon binding of NIH 3T3 cells to fibronectin, we assessed the effects of both inhibiting and activating the small GTPase Rho. We observed that inhibition of Rho by the Rho-specific inhibitor C3 exoenzyme or by a dominant negative Rho A (RhoN19) inhibited MAP kinase activation. Conversely, activation of Rho by expression of an activated Rho A mutant (RhoQ63L), or the Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor lbc, enhanced and partially mimicked activation of Erk2 by plating on fibronectin. These results therefore show that Rho is involved in the integrin-dependent activation of MAP kinase.

Cell surface receptors allow eukaryotic cells to receive and respond to extracellular stimuli by activating signal transduction pathways leading to changes in gene expression and cell cycle progression. Integrins are a family of transmembrane receptors that bind to proteins of the extracellular matrix, such as fibronectin, collagen, and vitronectin, and mediate a variety of signaling events (1Hynes R.O.

MAP kinases, also known as Erks (for extracellular-regulated kinases), become activated when cells adhere to substrata coated with integrin ligands, such as fibronectin, laminin type IV collagen, or a synthetic peptide containing the RGD sequence (Arg-Gly-Asp), found in many of these proteins. MAP kinases are considered to be key molecules for the transmission of extracellular signals to the nucleus. Substrates for MAP kinases include many transcription factors, such as TCF, Jun, Fos, Myc, NF-IL6, TAL1, and ATF2 (8Johnson G.L. Vaillancourt R.R. Curr. Opin.

Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar, 15Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 16Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Rho regulates the formation of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers. There is also strong evidence indicating that Rho plays a role in integrin-mediated signaling events. First, activated Rho is known to stimulate stress fiber formation (17Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3665) Google Scholar), and plating of cells onto fibronectin-coated dishes in serum-free medium results in the rapid formation of stress fibers. Second, both Rho and adhesion to fibronectin activate phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (18Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Third, specific inhibition of Rho using botulinum C3 exoenzyme blocks cellular responses, similar to the loss of integrin mediated cell adhesion (18Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 19Kumagai N. Morii N. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Last, injection of activated Rho restores the ability of suspended cells to respond to growth factors similar to adhesion (18Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). In this study we find that Rho is required for the activation of MAP kinase in cells plated on fibronectin. We demonstrate that this activation can be blocked by inhibiting Rho using either a dominant negative Rho mutant or C3 exoenzyme. Furthermore, we find that activation of Rho either by expression of a constitutively active mutant (RhoQ63L) or by the guanine nucleotide exchange protein Lbc (20Zheng Y. Olson M.F. Hall A. Cerione R.A. Toksoz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9031-9034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 21Toksoz D. Williams D.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 621-628PubMed Google Scholar) enhances the activation of MAP kinase observed upon binding to fibronectin and partially mimics this binding in suspended cells. These results demonstrate that Rho is a component of the pathway leading to the activation of MAP kinases by integrins. NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% bovine calf serum. CMV5 RhoN19 and CMV5 RhoQ63L clones were a gift obtained from Dr. Gary Bokoch (18Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), CMV5 Erk2 and CMV5 βgal clones have been described previously (22Renshaw M.W. Lea-Chou E. Wang J.Y.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 76-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For transfections, cells were plated at a density of 4 × 105 cells/6-cm dish 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (22Renshaw M.W. Lea-Chou E. Wang J.Y.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 76-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), using 0.2 µg of pCMV5 Erk2, 0.2 µg of pCMV5 βgal, and 1.6 µg of either the empty control plasmid (pCMV5), pCMV5 RhoN19 or pCMV5 RhoQ63L, per plate. 24 h after transfection, cells were transferred to medium containing 0.5% serum for an additional 24 h. Cells from indicated plates were then trypsinized and suspended in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% BSA (Calbiochem, nuclease- and protease-free), and 0.25 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). They were incubated in suspension for 2 h in dishes which had been coated with 1% heat-denatured BSA (Sigma fraction V). Cells were then transferred to dishes that had been coated with 25 µg/ml fibronectin and blocked with 1% BSA. As a positive control, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml TPA for 10 min prior to harvest. For C3 treatment, C3 was introduced into cells using the LipofectAMINE procedure. Cells were transfected with 11.25 µg of C3 per plate, and after 5 h, the medium was replaced with medium containing 0.1% serum for an additional 3 h. Cells were then trypsinized and suspended in serum-free DMEM and replated onto fibronectin-coated dishes as detailed above. For Lbc expressing cells, 3T3 cells were transfected with the lbc cDNA, and a stable polyclonal population was selected and checked for Lbc expression. Cells were plated and then transferred to medium containing 0.5% calf serum for 24 h and then trypsinized, suspended in serum-free DMEM, and replated onto fibronectin-coated dishes as detailed above. For assays of transfected HA-Erk2, purified anti-HA antibody (Boehringer Mannheim, 12CA5) was used for immunoprecipitations (IP). Anti-Erk2 (C-14, Santa Cruz) was used to IP and measure the activity of endogenous Erk2. Erk activities were measured from 150 µg of cell lysates. For transfected cells, the amount of cell lysate used in the IP was normalized to βgal activity levels to account for transfection efficiencies. βgal activity levels were measured as described previously (23Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) using 20 µg of the cell lysate. For all immunoprecipitations, one-fifth of the samples were saved and run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Hybond C (Amersham Corp.), and immunoblotted using the anti-Erk2 antibody, to measure the amount of Erk2 immunoprecipitated. Erk2 activity was measured using the in-gel kinase assay method as described previously (24Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Samples were run on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein (25Deibler G.E. Martenson R.E. Kies M.W. Prep. Biochem. 1972; 2: 139-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Kinase reactions were performed soaking gels in kinase buffer (26Granot Y. Erikson E. Fridman H. Putten V.V. Williams B. Schrier R.W. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9564-9569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing 25 µCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP and 10 µM cold ATP. Gels were washed exhaustively and analyzed by autoradiography and scanning densitometry using a model I.S. 1000 digital imaging system from Alpha-Innotech Corp. To investigate the role of the small GTPase Rho in the integrin-mediated activation of MAP kinase, we developed an assay using transient expression of hemagglutinin epitope-tagged Erk2 (Fig. 1). Using this assay, we observed activation of MAP kinase upon cell adhesion to fibronectin, similar to the level and time courses previously reported for endogenous Erks (4Miyamoto S. Termoto H.

In these experiments, we found that adherent cells had a low basal level of Erk2 activity (Fig. 1A, lane 1), which after trypsinization and placement of the cells in suspension was reduced to nearly undetectable levels (lane 3). Upon replating onto fibronectin, MAP kinase was substantially activated, consistent with previous work analyzing endogenous Erks (4Miyamoto S. Termoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 5Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol.

The peak of activity varied somewhat between experiments, occurring between 10 and 30 min after plating, then declined at later times. As a positive control, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml TPA for 10 min (lane 2). Integrin-stimulated Erk activation was consistently found to be 30-50% of that obtained with TPA. When dominant negative Rho (RhoN19) (Fig. 1A) was cotransfected with the Erk2, integrin-stimulated activation of the Erk2 kinase was consistently inhibited by 58-65% (Fig. 2). Examination at shorter or longer times showed similar inhibition (data not shown). A 45% reduction in the low basal level was also consistently observed in stably adherent cells. While complete inhibition was never observed, the level of Rho N19 expressed relative to the endogenous Rho protein may not have been sufficient to completely block Rho activity. By contrast, expression of RhoN19 had no effect on the activation of MAP kinase by TPA. We also analyzed the effects of a constitutively activated Rho (RhoQ63L) (Figs. 1B and 2). Cotransfection with RhoQ63L enhanced Erk2 activation upon plating onto fibronectin by 50 ± 12%. Furthermore, the decline in Erk activity observed when cells were detached and held in suspension was substantially inhibited. When RhoQ63L was cotransfected, ERK activity decreased by only 36% (14.0 ± 5.0 in adherent cells, 9.1 ± 3.0 in suspended cells) as compared with a 91% decrease in control cells (9.2 ± 5.0 in adherent cells, 0.8 ± 0.5 in suspended cells) (Fig. 2). These results indicate that not only does activated Rho enhance the response to fibronectin binding, but partially mimics it as well. RhoQ63L did not stimulate Erk2 activity levels in stably adherent cells, in agreement with previous reports (9Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 27Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar, 28Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar); however, it did slightly enhance the response to TPA. These changes in Erk2 activation were not due to differences in transfection efficiencies, since all values were normalized to the amount of Erk2 protein immunoprecipitated. To confirm these results, we analyzed the effects of constitutive activation of endogenous Rho upon integrin-dependent activation of endogenous Erk2. We examined cells expressing the Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange protein Lbc. The maximal activation of Erk2 upon plating onto fibronectin in cells expressing Lbc was 65 ± 18% higher than in control cells, and the duration of the response was also substantially increased (Figs. 3A and 4). We also observed that lbc cells retained a higher level of Erk2 activity in suspension compared to control cells. Thus, activation of endogenous Rho by Lbc gave results that were essentially identical to those obtained with transiently transfected RhoQ63L and HA-Erk2.Fig. 4Quantitative effects of activating or inhibiting endogenous Rho, upon Erk2 activation by integrins. Quantitative measurements of endogenous Erk2 activities were measured in untreated NIH 3T3 cells (Control), C3-transfected cells, as well as Lbc-expressing cells placed in suspension for 2 h and then transferred to fibronectin coated dishes for either 10, 20, 30, 45, or 60 min. Relative levels of activity are expressed as the relative amount of integrin-mediated activation as compared with the peak activation (10 min) observed in control cells. Values represent the data obtained from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Effects of inhibiting endogenous Rho on Erk2 activation were examined by treating cells with C3 exoenzyme. Staining of C3-treated cells with rhodamine-phalloidin showed that 74 ± 3% of the cells had disrupted stress fibers, compared with <5% for control cells, indicating that this fraction received C3. Cells were then trypsinized, replated on fibronectin and endogenous Erk2 activity measured (Fig. 3B). Treating cells with LipofectAMINE alone had no consistent appreciable effect; however, with C3-treated cells we observed a 67% decrease in the peak of Erk2 activation relative to control cells (Figs. 3B and 4). Normalizing for the fraction of C3-treated cells in which Rho function was disrupted indicates that Erk2 was inhibited by approximately 90%. Our results show that inhibiting Rho, either by cotransfection of HA-Erk2 with a dominant negative Rho construct or by treating cells with C3 exoenzyme, had little effect on TPA-stimulated MAP kinase activity, but substantially inhibited the activation by fibronectin. Conversely, activating Rho either with a constitutively activated Rho mutant or by expression of the nucleotide exchange factor lbc specifically enhanced the activation of MAP kinase by fibronectin. Constitutive activation of Rho also partially prevented the decline in basal MAP kinase activity that occurred after cell detachment, indicating that maintaining Rho function in suspended cells can partially substitute for cell adhesion. Essentially identical results were obtained with transiently transfected proteins and endogenous proteins. These data therefore demonstrate that Rho is involved in the activation of MAP kinase by fibronectin. It was recently reported that plating serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells onto fibronectin did not induce MAP kinase activation (29Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In that system, stress fibers and focal adhesions do not form due to inactivation of the Rho pathway by serum starvation. Although serum starvation is likely to alter many cellular pathways, these results are consistent with our findings that Rho activation must occur in order to observe MAP kinase activation by integrins. There are now several examples of signaling pathways in which inhibition of Rho in adherent cells results in behavior similar to suspended cells, while activation of Rho in suspended cells gives rise to behavior that mimics adherent cells (18Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 19Kumagai N. Morii N. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our data join this body of evidence demonstrating that Rho can mediate integrin signaling events and that constitutive activation of Rho prevents inactivation of integrin pathways upon cell detachment. Taken together, these data tend to support a model in which integrins activate Rho, which then mediates downstream integrin-dependent events. This model does not exclude modulation of Rho function by soluble factors such as lysophosphatidic acid or platelet-derived growth factor; indeed, there is ample evidence that Rho is also an important mediator of growth factor-dependent pathways (30Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3774) Google Scholar, 31Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3031) Google Scholar). How Rho contributes to MAP kinase activation is unknown. However, Ras has been indicated via a connection to focal adhesion kinase through a Grb2/SOS interaction (32Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar), and Rho has been shown to modulate focal adhesion kinase activation (19Kumagai N. Morii N. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), providing a possible link. These effects could be mediated by effects of Rho on the actin cytoskeleton, as cytochalasin D, which disrupts actin filaments can also block integrin-mediated activation of both focal adhesion kinase and MAP kinase. Thus, one possible pathway involves activation of Rho which leads to assembly of an actin scaffold required for the proper formation of focal adhesions. These structures may promote the association of signaling molecules such as focal adhesion kinase, which would then interact to induce activation of MAP kinase."

We have now coexpressed SERCA isoforms with the transmembrane sequence of PLN and with epitope-tagged transmembrane sequences of PLN to study intramembrane interactions in the absence of cytoplasmic interactions. Coexpression of the transmembrane sequence of phospholamban (Met-PLN28-52) with SERCA1a, SERCA2a, and SERCA3 inhibited Ca2+ transport by lowering apparent Ca2+ affinity.

Inhibition by PLN1-20-PLN30-52 or by Flag-PLN28-52 was reversed by PLN antibody or by Flag antibody, demonstrating that inhibition by these constructs is reversible and that the inhibitory constructs are properly oriented in the membrane.

The 52 amino acids contained in each subunit of PLN homopentamers are predicted to be divided into three domains (3Fujii J. Ueno A. Kitano K. Tanaka S. Kadoma M. Tada M. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). PLN domain Ia (amino acids 1-20) is highly charged and largely helical (4Mortishire-Smith R.J. Pitzenberger S.M. Burke C.J. Middaugh C.R. Garsky V.M. Johnson R.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7603-7613Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), domain Ib (amino acids 21-30) is polar and unstructured, and domain II (amino acids 31-52) is neutral, very hydrophobic, and helical. Protein-protein interactions between the cytoplasmic domains of PLN and SERCA2a have been demonstrated before, but not after, phosphorylation of PLN and in the absence of elevated Ca2+ (5James P. Inui M. Tada M. Chiesi M. Carafoli E. Nature. 1989; 342: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). It is clear that there is a functional interaction site between the cytoplasmic domains of PLN and SERCA2a, since mutation of any of 13 of the 20 amino acids making up PLN domain Ia (6Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

In earlier studies, the addition of soluble synthetic PLN1-31 suppressed Vmax without affecting Ca2+ affinity of purified SERCA2a, while the in vitro reconstitution of purified SERCA2a with an unphysiological 100-fold molar excess of synthetic PLN28-47 lowered the apparent Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2a (8Sasaki T. Inui M. Kimura Y. Kuzuya T. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1674-1679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Attempts to reproduce these experiments revealed that the addition of excess PLN26-52 uncoupled Ca2+ transport from ATP hydrolysis (9Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Cala S.E. O'Brian J.J. Tatulian S.A. Stokes D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus these experiments did not provide very strong evidence for a transmembrane interaction site between SERCA2a and PLN. Moreover, studies by Kirchberger et al. (10Kirchberger M.A. Borchman D. Kasinathan C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5484-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) showed that mild proteolysis, which removed most of the cytoplasmic sequence of PLN, activated SERCA2a by raising its apparent Ca2+ affinity. The interpretation of the results of this study, however, is clouded by the fact that tryptic digestion of a membrane system could have pleiotropic effects. In order to evaluate the functional effects of intramembrane interactions between PLN and SERCA2a, we added different epitope tags to the NH2 terminus of PLN domain II and coexpressed the constructs with SERCA isoforms, thereby achieving in vivo reconstitution between the two proteins. We have found that PLN domain II inhibits SERCA2a by lowering its apparent affinity for Ca2+. We propose that interactions between transmembrane domains of PLN and SERCA2a are inhibitory but are modulated through long range coupling to the cytoplasmic interaction sites in the two molecules. PLN constructs in which domain I was deleted or replaced with sequences expected to form epitopes for Flag (IBI), hemagglutinin (HA) (11Field J. Nikawa J. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A.

PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 177Google Scholar) using primers with 5′-add-on sequences containing restriction endonuclease sites and encoding proposed epitope sequences. Six PLN constructs were evaluated: PLN1-52, Met-PLN28-52 (no epitope), Flag-PLN28-52, HA-PLN28-52, Myc-PLN30-52, and PLN1-20-PLN30-52. The epitope sequences (italicized and in one-letter code) are: Flag, MDYKDDDDK-L28; HA, MYPYDVPDYA-L28; Myc, MEQKLISEEDL-N30; PLN1-20, MEKVQYLTRSAIRRASTIEM-N30. Although the Flag and PLN1-20 sequences formed functional epitopes, the HA and Myc sequences did not. All constructs were used, however, because they were all functional as PLN analogues. PLN construct cDNAs and SERCA cDNAs were cotransfected into HEK-293 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (6Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, 8 µg of PLN cDNA and 8 µg of SERCA2a cDNA (1:1) were added to each dish. In some cases, however, 4 µg of PLN1-20-PLN30-52 were mixed with 8 µg of SERCA2a cDNA and 4 µg of pMT2 DNA (1:2 ratio) or 12 µg of Met-PLN28-52 were mixed with 4 µg of SERCA3 cDNA (3:1 ratio). In other cases, 0.32 (1:10), 1.6 (1:2), 3.2 (1:1), 6.4 (2:1), 9.6 (3:1), or 12.8 (4:1) µg of PLN cDNA were cotransfected with 3.2 µg of SERCA2a cDNA, pMT2 DNA being added to make a total of 16 µg of DNA per transfection. Reducing SERCA2a cDNA from 8 µg to 3.2 µg reduced Vmax of Ca2+ transport, but not KCa. Microsomes were prepared and assayed for Ca2+ transport activity and data were analyzed as described previously (6Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured under conditions identical to those used for measurement of Ca2+ transport (6Toyofuku T.

Biochem. 1991; 192: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 15Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar), was adapted to the microscale required to measure the inorganic phosphate liberated from ATP during Ca2+ transport by transfected microsomes. The reaction was started by the addition of 80 µl of microsomes (1 mg/ml) to 600 µl of Ca2+ transport reaction mixture. After 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min, the reaction was stopped by the transfer of 100 µl of reaction mixture to 45 µl of malachite green reagent mixture in a 96-well microplate. The malachite green reagent mixture was made by mixing 0.122% malachite green hydrochloride in 6.2 N H2SO4, 5.76% ammonium paramolybdate tetrahydrate, and 11% Tween 20 in a volume ratio of 100:66:2. Color development was quenched after 10 s by the addition of 45 µl of 15.1% sodium citrate dihydrate. Inorganic phosphate liberated in the ATPase reaction was quantified by comparison of absorbance at 570 nm with standard curves generated with known amounts of Na2HPO4 in the presence of 5 mM ATP. At 15 min, 150 µl of the same microsomal sample was withdrawn and filtered for measurement of 45Ca2+ uptake. Background Ca2+ uptake and ATP hydrolysis, defined as those values obtained from cells transfected only with pMT2 vector DNA, were subtracted from each data point. Under these conditions, ATP hydrolysis was found to be linear for at least 25 min. Microsomes (0.8 mg/ml) were phosphorylated by 333 units/ml of cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (Sigma) in 0.15 M KCl, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 µM CaCl2, 3 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 25 µM ATP for 5 min at room temperature. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit was omitted in controls. The samples were then assayed for Ca2+ transport assay as described previously (6Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For detection of functional changes induced by anti-PLN antibody, microsomes transfected with SERCA2a and PLN or PLN1-20-PLN30-52 (1 mg/ml) were incubated with 0.25 mg/ml anti-PLN antibody 1D11, a generous gift from Dr. Robert Johnson, Merck Sharp and Dohme, in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.225 M sucrose, 0.135 M KCl, 0.18 µM CaCl2, 2.7 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.015 M NaCl for at least 30 min on ice. Alternatively, microsomes (0.8 mg/ml) from cells cotransfected with SERCA2a and Flag-PLN28-52 were incubated for 1 h on ice with 0.8 mg/ml anti-Flag antibody M2 (IBI) in a buffer containing 70 mM KCl, 117 mM sucrose, 80 mM NaCl, 9.34 µM CaCl2, 1.4 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5.33 mM sodium phosphate, and 4.67 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Buffer was added to control samples to achieve the same salt composition in samples plus and minus antibody. Ca2+ transport was assayed as described previously (6Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (6Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 0.2-micron polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) were used, and 10 µg of of protein were dissolved in loading buffer at room temperature before separation on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. Antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence using an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Corp.). PLN, when coexpressed with SERCA2a, shifts the curve of Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+ uptake toward a lower apparent Ca2+ affinity (Fig. 1, A-D). Apparent KCa (the Ca2+ concentration that gives half-maximal Ca2+ transport activity) was shifted from pCa 6.63 to pCa 6.31 when PLN and SERCA2a cDNAs were cotransfected in a 1:2 or 1:1 ratio (Fig. 1; Table I). Increasing the ratio of PLN cDNA to SERCA2a cDNA in the transfection system to 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1 did not shift apparent KCa beyond pCa 6.21 under conditions in which an increase in cDNA in the transfection assay induced an increase in PLN synthesis as judged by Western blotting (Fig. 2A).TABLE I.Effects of phospholamban domain II constructs on the apparent affinity of SERCA proteins for Ca2+PLN constructs coexpressed with SERCA constructsKCa (pCa)SERCA2anSERCA1nSERCA3nNone6.63 ± 0.06236.47 ± 0.0546.02 ± 0.0611PLN (1:10)6.42 ± 0.13aAmount of SERCA2a cDNA was 3.2 µg rather than 8 µg per transfection.3NDbND, not determined.NDPLN (1:2)6.31 ± 0.02aAmount of SERCA2a cDNA was 3.2 µg rather than 8 µg per transfection.2NDNDPLN (1:1)6.31 ± 0.08cp < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.216.21 ± 0.02cp < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.35.88 ± 0.082PLN (2:1)6.21 ± 0.05aAmount of SERCA2a cDNA was 3.2 µg rather than 8 µg per transfection.3NDNDPLN (3:1)6.20 ± 0.06aAmount of SERCA2a cDNA was 3.2 µg rather than 8 µg per transfection.2NDNDPLN (4:1)6.25 ± 0.02aAmount of SERCA2a cDNA was 3.2 µg rather than 8 µg per transfection.2NDNDMet-PLN28-526.46 ± 0.06cp < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.76.37 ± 0.05cp < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.45.85 ± 0.09cp < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test., dMet-PLN28-52 DNA was transfected in a weight ratio of 3:1 over SERCA3 cDNA.4Myc-PLN30-526.29 ± 0.09cp < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.4NDNDFlag-PLN28-526.22 ± 0.11cp < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.86.15 ± 0.01cp < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.45.71 ± 0.08cp < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.4HA-PLN28-526.00 ± 0.06cp < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.65.89 ± 0.10cp < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.35.77 ± 0.10cp < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.3PLN1-20-PLN30-52 (1:2)5.76 ± 0.25cp < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.75.61 ± 0.08cp < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.3NDPLN1-20-PLN30-52 (1:1)<5.61eStatistical analysis was not done because Ca2+ uptake was completely inhibited in two experiments, even at 10 µM free Ca2+.55.55 ± 0.07cp < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.35.60 ± 0.01cp < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.3a Amount of SERCA2a cDNA was 3.2 µg rather than 8 µg per transfection.b ND, not determined.c p < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.d Met-PLN28-52 DNA was transfected in a weight ratio of 3:1 over SERCA3 cDNA.e Statistical analysis was not done because Ca2+ uptake was completely inhibited in two experiments, even at 10 µM free Ca2+. Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Immunoblotting of SERCA2a and PLN domain II constructs. In all panels, 10 µg of microsomal protein were separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and the gels were divided horizontally at a level corresponding to the mobility of a protein of Mr 46,000. The upper segment was electroblotted onto 0.2-micron polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for 1.5 h, and the lower segment was blotted for 45 min. The upper segments in A and B were incubated with anti-SERCA2 monoclonal antibody IID8F6, and the lower segments in A and B were incubated with anti-PLN monoclonal antibody 1D11. Panel C was incubated with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody M2. HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Promega) was used as the secondary antibody in all panels. After addition of the substrates for chemiluminescence, the membranes were exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film for the following times: A, upper panel, 5 s; A, lower panel, 15 s; B, upper and lower panels, 30 s; C, 1 min.

Unfortunately, we could not assess the level of expression of Met-PLN28-52, since we had no antibody against domain II. We added epitope tags to PLN domain II in an attempt to measure synthesis of the PLN derivatives but found that they also resulted in very effective inhibitory constructs. Myc-PLN30-52 lowered apparent Ca2+ affinity to pCa 6.29, Flag-PLN28-52 lowered apparent Ca2+ affinity to pCa 6.22, and HA-PLN28-52“supershifted” apparent Ca2+ affinity to pCa 6.00. Our most effective inhibitor of SERCA2a was PLN1-20-PLN30-52. When the ratio of PLN1-20-PLN30-52 cDNA to SERCA2a cDNA in the cotransfection system was 1:2, the PLN construct supershifted apparent KCa to pCa 5.76. When PLN1-20-PLN30-52 and SERCA2a cDNA were transfected in a weight ratio of 1:1, the KCa measured in three of five experiments was supershifted to less than 5.61 pCa units, and in two of five experiments no Ca2+ uptake was observed, even at 10 µM free Ca2+ (Fig. 1B; Table I). In all of these experiments SERCA2a was expressed at about the same level in the absence and in the presence of coexpressed PLN as judged by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2, A and B). The expression level of PLN1-20-PLN30-52, however, appeared to be lower than that of PLN as judged by Western blotting with the same antibody (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2B shows that PLN1-20-PLN30-52 is a mixture of oligomer and monomer much like intact PLN, and in Fig. 2C we show that Flag-PLN28-52 is also a mixture of oligomers and monomer. Since supershifts occurred without apparent overexpression of PLN1-20-PLN30-52 and since we could not achieve supershifting by adding more PLN cDNA to the transfection reaction, we conclude that the supershifts result from a qualitative change in the efficiency of the inhibitory peptides and are not related to overexpression. The PLN constructs also suppressed Ca2+ transport by SERCA1a (16Brandl C.J. deLeon S. Martin D.R. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3768-3774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and SERCA3 (17Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lowering the apparent affinity for Ca2+ in each case (Fig. 1, C and D; Table I). Although SERCA3 has a lower apparent Ca2+ affinity than either SERCA1a or SERCA2a (18Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 2809-2815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), NH2-terminal-truncated and epitope-tagged PLN constructs lowered its Ca2+ affinity even further. The rank order for potency of suppression of Ca2+ uptake by the various PLN constructs was the same for SERCA1a and SERCA2a, but the order of inhibition for Flag-PLN28-52 and HA-PLN28-52 was inverted for SERCA3. To evaluate the possibility that the transmembrane domain of PLN might uncouple Ca2+ uptake from Ca2+-ATPase (9Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Cala S.E. O'Brian J.J. Tatulian S.A. Stokes D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) we measured Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity and Ca2+ uptake simultaneously. As shown in Table II, the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by PLN constructs was mirrored by inhibition of Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity, even though values of Ca2+ uptake and ATP hydrolysis varied from experiment to experiment depending on expression levels. Those samples which exhibited no Ca2+ transport activity also had no ATPase activity. Thus it is unlikely that PLN constructs uncoupled Ca2+ translocation from ATP hydrolysis.TABLE II.Effects of phospholamban domain II constructs on the stoichiometry between Ca2+ translocation and ATP hydrolysisConstructs coexpressed with SERCA2apCanCa2+ uptake in microsomesATP hydrolysis in microsomesCa2+/ATP rationmol/min/mgnmol/min/mgNone6.7576.9 ± 4.54.8 ± 3.11.5 ± 0.55.5720.4 ± 11.110.5 ± 5.52.0 ± 0.7PLN6.7541.7 ± 1.11.9 ± 1.41.0 ± 0.35.5515.4 ± 8.010.1 ± 4.91.7 ± 0.8HA-PLN28-526.7560.7 ± 0.60.6 ± 1.0NDaCa2+/ATP ratio was not determined because both Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+-ATPase activity were at background levels.5.5615.9 ± 4.59.0 ± 2.31.8 ± 0.5PLN1-20-PLN30-52 (1:1)6.7550.10 ± 0.1-0.1 ± 0.4NDaCa2+/ATP ratio was not determined because both Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+-ATPase activity were at background levels.5.556.2 ± 8.12.0 ± 2.9NDbCa2+/ATP ratio was not determined because we detected neither Ca2+ uptake nor ATPase activity in two of five samples in which Ia-PLN30-52 and SERCA2a were cotransfected in a ratio of 1:1, and we detected very little activity in one sample, even at pCa = 5.5.a Ca2+/ATP ratio was not determined because both Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+-ATPase activity were at background levels.b Ca2+/ATP ratio was not determined because we detected neither Ca2+ uptake nor ATPase activity in two of five samples in which Ia-PLN30-52 and SERCA2a were cotransfected in a ratio of 1:1, and we detected very little activity in one sample, even at pCa = 5.5. Open table in a new tab Since PLN1-20-PLN30-52 could potentially be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), we examined the question of whether phosphorylation of PLN domain Ia could exert a regulatory influence over domain II in this chimeric peptide. Unfortunately, PLN1-20-PLN30-52 was not phosphorylated by PKA under conditions in which PLN was phosphorylated, leading to an increase in Ca2+ uptake at a low Ca2+ concentration. Monoclonal antibodies against PLN domain Ia can also reverse PLN inhibition of SERCA2 activity (21Suzuki T. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7018-7023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jones L.R. Field L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11486-11488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mayer E.J.

We observed that SERCA2a activities inhibited by either PLN1-20-PLN30-52 or Flag-PLN28-52 were enhanced by either the anti-PLN antibody 1D11 or the anti-Flag monoclonal antibody M2 at low Ca2+ concentrations (Table III). These antibodies had little effect on the Ca2+ uptake activity of microsomes transfected with SERCA2 alone.TABLE III.Effects of anti-Flag antibody (A) and anti-PLN antibody 1D11 (B) on the inhibition of SERCA2a by phospholamban domain II constructsAConstructs coexpressed with SERCA2apCanCa2+ uptake in microsomesIncreaseControlAntibody-treatednmol/min/mg%None6.7535.4 ± 2.55.0 ± 2.7-9.2 ± 8.36.5416.0 ± 14.514.9 ± 13.6-7.3 ± 6.65.5330.6 ± 26.029.1 ± 26.1-6.6 ± 7.0PLN6.7531.3 ± 0.61.3 ± 0.6-1.1 ± 15.76.534.0 ± 2.74.0 ± 2.714.2 ± 17.45.5320.8 ± 13.120.8 ± 13.15.1 ± 5.5Flag-PLN28-526.7540.9 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.8ap < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.106.4 ± 46.66.543.3 ± 1.45.7 ± 1.6ap < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.81.9 ± 36.85.5414.0 ± 6.514.9 ± 5.913.7 ± 34.6BConstructs coexpressed with SERCA2apCanCa2+ uptake in microsomesIncreaseControlAntibody-treatednmol/min/mg%None6.7534.2 ± 2.34.3 ± 2.44.3 ± 10.46.536.6 ± 3.47.0 ± 3.47.0 ± 7.95.5312.7 ± 3.412.7 ± 7.85.6 ± 10.8PLN6.7530.8 ± 0.23.7 ± 0.8ap < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.353 ± 1136.531.4 ± 0.55.9 ± 1.6ap < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.367 ± 1775.5312.3 ± 1.814.6 ± 2.120 ± 14PLN1-20-PLN30-52 (1:2)6.031.3 ± 0.917.0 ± 7.0ap < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.1668 ± 10935.7534.5 ± 2.520.6 ± 9.1ap < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.383 ± 665.0312.6 ± 5.217.9 ± 8.2ap < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test.40 ± 11a p < 0.05 vs. control by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe F-test. Open table in a new tab We found that PLN constructs which lacked domain Ia, the site of interaction with cytoplasmic domains of SERCA2, were able to inhibit SERCA2a by lowering its apparent affinity for Ca2+. Met-PLN28-52 alone shifted KCa significantly, Myc-PLN30-52 and Flag-PLN28-52 were as effective as PLN in lowering apparent Ca2+ affinity, and HA-PLN28-52 supershifted apparent Ca2+ affinity to values lower than that which could be achieved even with overexpression of native PLN. The inhibitory effects of the epitope-tagged PLN domain II constructs were not correlated with any specific characteristic of the epitope. Met-PLN28-52 was inhibitory without an epitope and the three added epitopes were not structurally related. Moreover, they were negatively charged (-3 for Myc and Flag; -2 for HA) instead of positively charged like PLN (+3) or the domain Ia epitope PLN1-20 (+2). PLN1-20-PLN30-52 in which domain Ib (Pro21-Asn29) was deleted was the strongest inhibitor of SERCA2a. Transfection with a PLN1-20-PLN30-52 cDNA to SERCA2a cDNA ratio of 1:1 led to complete inhibition of Ca2+ transport even at 10 µM Ca2+, and lowering of the ratio to 1:2 brought the K0.5 for Ca2+ activation into the measurable range. Western blotting with an anti-PLN antibody did not provide any indication that PLN1-20-PLN30-52 was overexpressed by comparison with PLN (Fig. 2B). Our PLN constructs also suppressed Ca2+ transport by SERCA1a and SERCA3, lowering their apparent affinity for Ca2+. The site of cytoplasmic interaction with PLN, KDDKPV402 in SERCA2, is conserved as KNDKPI402 in SERCA1a but altered to QGEQLV402 in SERCA3 (17Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the fact that SERCA1a activity is inhibited by native PLN, while SERCA3 activity is scarcely affected by its coexpression with PLN (7Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22929-22932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2809-2815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the sequences of most of the transmembrane helices are highly conserved among the three SERCA isoforms (17Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even though SERCA3 had a lower apparent affinity for Ca2+ than either SERCA1a or SERCA2a (18Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), epitope-tagged or NH2-terminal-truncated PLN constructs, but not PLN itself, lowered the apparent affinity of SERCA3 for Ca2+ even further. The rank order for potency of suppression of Ca2+ uptake by the various PLN constructs was similar for SERCA1a, SERCA2a, and SERCA3. These results are consistent with the view that it is a transmembrane interaction site and not the cytoplasmic interaction site that is responsible for lowering the apparent Ca2+ affinity of all three SERCA molecules. It has been suggested that the transmembrane domain of PLN might uncouple Ca2+ uptake from Ca2+-ATPase (9Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Cala S.E. O'Brian J.J. Tatulian S.A. Stokes D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In our experiments, however, the inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by PLN constructs was mirrored by their inhibition of Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity, and those samples which exhibited no Ca2+ transport activity had no ATPase activity. Thus those of our PLN constructs which were tested did not uncouple Ca2+ translocation from ATP hydrolysis in SERCA2. We could not determine whether phosphorylation of PLN domain Ia could exert a direct regulatory influence over domain II in chimeric peptides, since PLN1-20-PLN30-52 was not phosphorylated by PKA. This lack of recognition of the PKA phosphorylation site in PLN1-20-PLN30-52 is consistent with a change in the exposure of the domain Ia sequence to cytoplasmic molecules in this construct. A monoclonal antibody against PLN domain Ia, however, activated PLN1-20-PLN30-52-inhibited SERCA2a just as it does for PLN-inhibited SERCA2a (21Suzuki T. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7018-7023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jones L.R. Field L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11486-11488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mayer E.J. McKenna E. Garsky V.M. Burke C.J. Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Sardana M. Smith J.S. Johnson Jr., R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1669-1677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An antibody against the Flag epitope also reversed the inhibition of SERCA2a by Flag-PLN28-52. Thus it is apparent that the inhibition of SERCA2a, induced by different PLN constructs, can be reversed by modulation of the cytoplasmic domain of the chimeric PLN constructs, just as modulation of the cytoplasmic domain of intact PLN by phosphorylation or antibody interaction can modulate PLN inhibition of SERCA2a. Conclusions concerning the orientation of two of our chimeras can be drawn from these studies. The activating PLN and Flag antibodies can only be effective from the cytoplasmic side of the sealed Ca2+-impermeable microsomes used in this study. Accordingly, the epitopes in the chimeric molecules PLN1-20-PLN30-52 and Flag-PLN28-52 must be cytoplasmic and the transmembrane sequence must be in the same orientation in the chimeras and in native PLN. From these results we propose a model of PLN-SERCA2a interaction in which PLN interacts with SERCA2a in at least two sites, one in the cytoplasmic sequences of PLN and SERCA2a and one within the transmembrane sequences of PLN and SERCA2a. We propose that the interaction between the transmembrane sequences of PLN and SERCA2a inhibits SERCA2a by altering its apparent Ca2+ affinity. We also propose that interaction between PLN domain Ia and the cytoplasmic domain of SERCA2a is not by itself inhibitory (8Sasaki T. Inui M. Kimura Y. Kuzuya T. Tada M. J. Biol.

If the cytoplasmic interaction is disrupted by PLN phosphorylation or binding of antibody, the inhibitory intramembrane interactions are also disrupted. If the inhibitory transmembrane interaction sites are disrupted by elevated Ca2+ concentrations, leading to Ca2+ binding to the high affinity Ca2+ binding and translocation sites in the transmembrane domain of SERCA molecules, then the regulatory cytoplasmic interaction sites are also disrupted. In a striking analogy, long range interactions between the catalytic ATP hydrolytic site in the cytoplasmic headpiece domain of SERCA1 and the Ca2+ binding and translocation sites in the transmembrane domain, mediated through a stalk sector, are an integral feature of Ca2+ transport by SERCA molecules (24MacLennan D.H. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 1355-1365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25MacLennan D.H. Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Skerjanc I. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 146: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is now clear that PLN also has functional cytoplasmic (domain Ia) and transmembrane (domain II) domains, which are separated by a stalk sector (domain Ib) and that long range interactions occur between these functional domains. This long range coupling may occur entirely within the PLN molecule or it may be mediated by conduction through the SERCA2a molecule from its cytoplasmic to its transmembrane sites of interaction with PLN. In this case, a four-site regulatory circuit, possibly involving the catalytic site in the cytoplasmic domain of SERCA2a and the Ca2+ binding and translocation sites in the transmembrane domain of SERCA2a, might best describe the interactions between SERCA2a and PLN. We propose that PLN interacts only weakly with SERCA3 because the lack of compatible cytosolic interaction sites obviates the enmeshing of the transmembrane interaction sites. The transmembrane sequences of PLN constructs in which domain I is replaced or in which domain Ia is located nearer to the membrane surface (PLN1-20-PLN30-52) may interact directly with the transmembrane sequence of SERCA3, because steric hindrances created by the poor fit of the cytoplasmic interaction sites in the full length molecule are bypassed in the truncated molecule.

The human TEFs are differentially expressed in cultured cell lines and the mouse (m)TEFs are differentially expressed in embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues in early post-implantation embryos. Strikingly, at later stages of embryogenesis, mTEF-3 is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle precursors, whereas mTEF-1 is expressed not only in developing skeletal muscle but also in the myocardium. Together with previous data, these results point to important, partially redundant, roles for these TEF proteins in myogenesis and cardiogenesis. In addition, mTEF-1 is strongly coexpressed with mTEF-4 in mitotic neuroblasts, while accentuated mTEF-4 expression is also observed in the gut and the nephrogenic region of the kidney.

To examine the importance of thrombin signaling in vivo and to define the cloned thrombin receptor's role, we disrupted the thrombin receptor gene (tr) in mice. Platelets from tr−/− mice responded normally to thrombin, but tr−/− fibroblasts showed no thrombin-induced calcium mobilization or phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Thus distinct thrombin receptors act in different tissues. This study focuses on the role of the thrombin receptor in thrombin-induced mitogenesis and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation in mesenchymal cells. Thrombin and thrombin receptor agonist peptide both stimulated DNA synthesis and MAP kinase activation in fibroblasts derived from wild-type mice. These responses were selectively lost in fibroblasts from tr−/− mice. Activation of the cloned thrombin receptor is therefore necessary and sufficient for thrombin-induced mitogenesis and MAP kinase activation in mouse lung fibroblasts. The tr−/− mouse thus provides a valuable model for defining the role of thrombin-induced proliferative events in vivo. Because thrombin-induced MAP kinase activation was attributable to a single receptor expressed at natural levels, mouse lung fibroblasts presented an opportunity to define the pathways that normally mediate activation of MAP kinase by the thrombin receptor. Elimination of phorbol-sensitive protein kinase C by prolonged exposure to phorbol ester only partially inhibited MAP kinase activation by thrombin but completely blocked c-Raf kinase activation. Pertussis toxin partially inhibited MAP kinase activation by thrombin but had no significant effect on c-Raf kinase activation. Thus in mouse lung fibroblasts, one thrombin receptor utilizes two pathways for MAP kinase activation: one is protein kinase C- and c-Raf dependent, and a second is Gi-dependent and c-Raf-independent.

https://openalex.org/W2087281748,"Abstract Endothelial cells express a cell surface co-receptor for plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) which we recently identified as annexin II (Hajjar, K. A., Jacovina, A. T., and Chacko, J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 21191-21197). This protein enhances the catalytic efficiency of t-PA-dependent plasmin generation by 60-fold (Cesarman, G. M., Guevara, C. A., and Hajjar, K. A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 21198-21203). Here, we demonstrate that annexin II is constitutively translocated to the endothelial cell surface within 16 h of biosynthesis, and that cell surface annexin II comprises 4.3 ± 1.0% of the total cellular pool. Exogenous 125I-annexin II bound to EGTA-washed endothelial cells with high affinity (Kd 49 n) and in a calcium-dependent (I50 = 3 μ), phospholipid-sensitive manner. Peptides KASMKGLGTDED and YDSMKGKGTRDK, mimicking the calcium-binding “endonexin” motif (KGXGT) of annexin II, blocked its interaction with endothelial cells. Recombinant annexin II, bearing the calcium-binding site substitution D161A of core repeat 2, failed to compete with binding of the wild type protein to the cell surface, while E246A and D321A mutants, corresponding to core repeats 3 and 4, behaved as effective competitors. These data suggest that translocated annexin II interacts with cell surface phospholipid via a high affinity calcium-dependent binding site that includes residues 118-122 (KGLGT) and the coordinating Asp161 of core repeat 2. Thus, calcium-regulated expression of annexin II on the endothelial cell surface may play a central role in control of plasmin-mediated processes."

The plantar stratum corneum was extracted, and SCCE was purified by the method of Egelrud (1Egelrud T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 200-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 g of stratum corneum were incubated in 1000 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% NaN3, pH 8.0, at 37°C for 24 h. After centrifugation (750 × g, 10 min) the sediments of the dissociated corneocytes were extracted by dilution with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 2 M KCl, pH 8.0 (1:2, w/v) at 4°C for 5 h with gentle agitation. The extracts were cleared by centrifugation (6250 × g, 30 min) and by subsequent filtration (Schleicher & Schüll, Germany; number 595). SCCE was purified from the cleared KCl extract by affinity chromatography on an SBTI column prepared with 20 mg of SBTI and 2.5 ml of Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Remaining active groups of the gel were blocked by ethanolamine. The cleared KCl extract was run through the SBTI column with a flow of 40 ml/h. The column was washed with 20 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 1 M KCl, pH 8.0, and 10 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The bound protein was eluted stepwise with 15 ml of 1, 10, and 100 mM HCl. The separation was monitored by recording the absorbance at 280 nm, and 2-ml fractions were collected in vials containing 1 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to adjust the pH of the eluate at pH 7.5. The purity of SCCE was proven by SDS-PAGE. For N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, pooled fractions of the affinity chromatography were further purified by reversed phase C18 HPLC using a SMART 228 system (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). About 5.5 µg of SCCE were chromatographed on a reversed phase C18 SC (Pharmacia, LKB Biotechnology AB) column using buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and buffer B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). The separation was performed at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min using a 3-ml linear gradient from 10 to 40% B followed by a 1-ml linear gradient to 100% B. The absorption was continuously recorded at 215 nm, and fractions were collected peakwise. Human stratum corneum slices (10 g) were suspended in 100 ml of distilled water, acidified to pH 2.8 by the addition of 1% citrate plus formic acid, diluted with 20 volume % ethanol (97%) and frozen (-80°C). After mechanical disruption by three cycles of freeze-thawing and Ultraturrax homogenization (1 h, 4°C) the solution was centrifuged (6000 × g, 15 min). The supernatant was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon YM5; Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) and diafiltered against 0.01 M ammonium formate, pH 4.0. The extracts were chromatographed by cation exchange HPLC on a Mono S® HR 5/5 column (5 × 50 mm, LKB, Uppsala, Sweden) using three different eluents: buffer A (0.01 M ammonium formate, 25% acetonitrile, pH 4.0), buffer B (0.5 M ammonium formate, 25% acetonitrile, pH 4.0), and buffer C (0.5 M ammonium formate, 25% acetonitrile, pH 3.0). The chromatographic run was performed using buffer A for 10 min (flow 0.5-1.0 ml/min) followed by a 20-min linear gradient to 100% buffer B (flow 1.0 ml/min) and continued by 15 min of buffer B as well as 45 min of buffer C. Proteins were recorded by continuous UV detection at 280 nm, and fractions were collected automatically. 25 µl of each fraction was lyophilized and tested for inhibitory activity for SCCE. SDS-PAGE was performed with a Pharmacia PhastSystem apparatus (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) using homogenous 20% SDS-gels or 8-25% gradient SDS-gels. Samples were lyophilized and solubilized in 0.05 M Tris, 4% SDS, 0.12 g/ml glycine, 0.02% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8. The following molecular mass markers were used: bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), egg albumin (45 kDa), porcine pepsin (34.7 kDa), bovine trypsinogen (24 kDa), bovine β-lactoglobulin (18.4 kDa), and lysozyme (14.3 kDa) (Sigma, MW-SDS-70 kit). Proteins were stained with the silver stain method of Heukeshoven and Dernik (6Heukeshoven J. Dernik R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). A purified freeze-dried sample of SCCE was solubilized in distilled water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A 250-ng aliquot was subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis on an Applied Biosystems model 476A pulsed liquid phase sequencer with on-line analysis of the phenylthiohydantoins using a 120 A PTH analyzer. Since the sample was not derivatized prior to sequencing, cysteines could not be detected. The procedure of Lundstrüm and Egelrud (2Lundstrüm A. Egelrud T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 91: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was followed. About 0.5-mm-thick flakes of stratum corneum were cut parallel to the skin surface from the heels of healthy volunteers. After the tissue had been soaked in 0.01 M sodium phosphate, 0.14 M NaCl, 0.1% NaN3, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.2, for 5 h at room temperature, loosely attached cells were scraped off with a scalpel. Stratum corneum cylinders with a defined surface area were prepared with a 3-mm biopsy punch. Cylinders were incubated in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes with 1 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% NaN3, pH 8.0, for 18 h at 37°C. After vortex agitation (30 s), the tissue pieces were removed from the incubation solution. The released cells were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min), washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and extracted with 1 M NaOH (2Lundstrüm A. Egelrud T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 91: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Solubilized protein was quantified using a detergent-stable protein assay (DC protein assay kit) with bovine serum albumin treated with 1 M NaOH as standard. The linear correlation of detached corneocytes and total alkali-soluble protein has previously been shown by Christensen et al. (7Christensen M.S. Nacht S. Kantor S.L. Gans E.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1978; 71: 289-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Activity of SCCE was monitored using the chromogenic substrate MeO-Suc-Arg-Pro-Tyr-pNA. All assays were performed in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.4 M NaCl, 1% Me2SO, 0.1 mg/ml Triton X-100, pH 8.0, at 37°C. The changes of absorbance at 405 nm were followed up to 1 h in comparison with enzyme-free controls. Inhibition of SCCE was measured after preincubating the enzyme with various inhibitors for 15 min at 21°C. 675 ng of SCCE (final concentration 27 nM) and inhibitors were incubated in 333 µl of assay buffer before the addition of 0.5 mM substrate in 667 µl of assay buffer. Initial velocities of amidolysis were measured as a function of several fixed substrate concentrations (0.1-1.6 mM) for different ALP concentrations (25-850 nM). Substrate with or without ALP in 988 µl of assay buffer was preincubated for 10 min, and the reaction was initiated by adding 12 µl of a SCCE solution (675 ng). The release of p-nitroaniline was monitored at 405 nm for 1 h. The data sets were analyzed using the specific velocity plot according to Baici (8Baici A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a graphical method for the determination of inhibition parameters of both linear and hyperbolic enzyme inhibitors. This method is based on the general modifier mechanism (9Botts J. Morales M. Faraday Soc. Trans. 1953; 49: 696-707Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar) shown in Scheme 1.

Ki = [E][I]/[EI], KS = [E][S]/[ES], αKi = [ES][I]/[ESI], αKS = [EI][S]/[ESI], kcat= catalytic constant, and α and β are coefficients. Assuming that the inhibitor binds in a rapid equilibrium fashion and the catalytic step is irreversible, the following equation holds true (8Baici A. Eur. J.

The specific velocity plot of υ0/υi versus σ/(1 +σ) is a straight line irrespective of the actual values of Ki, α, and β. Various combinations of the α and β coefficients generate any type of inhibition. Linear systems are characterized by β = 0, whereas hyperbolic inhibition is characterized by 0 < β≤ 1. The coefficient α determines whether the inhibition is of competitive, noncompetitive, or mixed character. The coefficients α and β and the inhibition constant Ki can be calculated using replots. Calling a and b the intercepts for σ/(1 +σ) = 0 and 1, respectively, these are obtained by plotting a/(a - 1) and b/(b - 1) versus 1/[I]. aa−1=αKiα−β1β[I]+αα−β(Eq. 2) bb−1=αKi1−β1β[I]+11−β(Eq. 3) Both replots are linear and the kinetic parameters can be calculated from the intercepts on the abscissa, which are -1/Ki for Equation 2 and -1/αKi for Equation 3. SCCE activity was active-site-titrated using recombinant eglin c. Titration with active-site-titrated human sputum elastase (with recombinant elafin) revealed that recombinant ALP was more than 90% active. A fixed amount of SCCE (675 ng) was incubated for 10 min with various amounts of ALP, aprotinin, and eglin c in 333 µl of assay buffer. To determine the residual activity, samples were diluted to 1 ml in assay buffer containing substrate (final concentration 1.33 mM) and then immediately assayed for hydrolytic activity as described above. The equilibrium dissociation constants of ALP and aprotinin for SCCE were determined by fitting Equation 4, an equation for the analysis of hyperbolic, tight binding inhibition (10Szedlacsek S.E. Ostafe V. Serban M. Vlad M.O. Biochem. J. 1987; 254: 311-312Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), to data. For the system SCCE/eglin c Ki was determined by curve fitting according to Equation 5 (this is obtained from Equation 4 with ϵ∞ = 0 and α = ∞). υi=υ0−υ∞21+σα+σαKi[E]t+[I]t[E]t−12+41+σα+σαKi[E]t+υ0+υ∞υ0−υ∞−1+σα+σαKi[E]t−[I]t[E]t(Eq. 4) υi=υ02(1+σ)Ki[E]t+[I]t[E]t−12+4(1+σ)Ki[E]t+1−(1+σ)Ki[E]t−[I]t[E]t(Eq. 5) In Equations 4 and 5, υ0 represents velocity without inhibitor, υi is velocity in the presence of inhibitor; υ∞ is residual velocity at saturating inhibitor concentration, [E]t is total concentration of enzyme (SCCE, 27 nM); and [I]t is total inhibitor concentration (4-2250 nM for ALP, 5-2700 nM for aprotinin, 3-411 nM for eglin c). Nonlinear regression analysis of experimental data was performed with Fig.P (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) and Minsq II (MicroMath, Salt Lake City, UT) software. Using the method previously described by Egelrud (1Egelrud T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 200-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) about 4 µg of active stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme per gram of stratum corneum could be purified by SBTI affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis of unreduced fractions showed one major band with an apparent molecular mass of 24 kDa and a minor band with a slightly higher apparent molecular mass. Further purification of pooled fractions from the affinity chromatography with reversed phase C18 HPLC gave a double peak recorded at 215 nm coinciding with a double peak of SCCE activity. N-terminal sequence analysis of both fractions with SCCE activity gave the same result: Ile-Ile-Asp-Gly-Pro-X-Ala-X-Gly-Ser. In searching for a suitable substrate for kinetic studies, several chromogenic substrates with specificities for chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and elastase-like enzymes were tested for their hydrolysis by SCCE. The resulting data is presented in Table I. MeO-Suc-Arg-Pro-Tyr-pNA proved to be the most effective substrate for SCCE, followed by Z-Phe-Val-Arg-pNA and Suc-Val-Pro-Phe-pNA with 4- and 9-fold lower kcat/Km values, respectively. SCCE did not degrade the two substrates with specificities for trypsin-like enzymes Z-Arg-pNA and p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA. This substrate specificity profile for SCCE is typical for an endopeptidase with chymotrypsin-like activity.TABLE I.Substrate hydrolysis by human stratum corneum chymotryptic enzymeSubstratesaThe substrates were used in a concentration range of 0.05-1.0 mM.

Open table in a new tab In extracts of human stratum corneum we found inhibitory activity for SCCE. Partially purification of these extracts by cation exchange HPLC revealed two inhibitory activities for SCCE (data not shown). Table II shows a qualitative screening of the effects of several inhibitors on the hydrolytic activity of SCCE. ALP, eglin c, and the human plasma inhibitors α1-proteinase inhibitor, α1-antichymotrypsin, and α2-macroglobulin efficiently inhibited SCCE. The inhibitory activity of aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and ZnSO4 was in good agreement with the findings of Egelrud and Lundstrüm (1Egelrud T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 200-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Egelrud T. Lundstrüm A. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1991; 283: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The SCCE activity was only weakly inhibited by elafin in a 100-fold molar excess (Ki = 1.6 × 10-6 M). No significant inhibition of the hydrolytic activity by SCCE was detected with phenanthroline and EDTA (inhibitors of metalloproteases), with E-64 (an inhibitor of cysteine endopeptidases), and with pepstatin (an inhibitor of aspartic endopeptidases).TABLE II.Effects of endopeptidase inhibitors on SCCEInhibitorFinal concentrationActivity ± S.D.nµm%AntileukoproteaseaDissolved in the assay buffer0.1544.0 ± 2.150.5528.0 ± 1.031.118.7 ± 1.232.211.2 ± 0.93ElafinaDissolved in the assay buffer0.1595.1 ± 3.651.566.7 ± 1.733.061.8 ± 5.64Eglin CaDissolved in the assay buffer0.150.2 ± 0.95AprotininaDissolved in the assay buffer0.1537.9 ± 1.550.6721.3 ± 1.031.3314.1 ± 0.732.79.7 ± 0.73Soybean trypsin inhibitoraDissolved in the assay buffer0.150.4 ± 0.85α1-Proteinase inhibitoraDissolved in the assay buffer0.1510.4 ± 3.75α1-AntichymotrypsinaDissolved in the assay buffer0.150.4 ± 0.95α2-MacroglobulinaDissolved in the assay buffer0.1555.8 ± 2.151.054.9 ± 1.93E-64bDissolved in Me2SO.

Open table in a new tab The SCCE-ALP interaction was characterized by incomplete inhibition of the enzyme at saturating ALP concentrations. Before attempting a Ki determination from titration curves, the inhibition type was first investigated using the specific velocity plot (Fig. 1). This method offers many advantages for the diagnosis of classical, i.e. non-tight-binding, reversible inhibitors, for which the condition [I] ≃ [I]t can experimentally be realized. In order to fulfill this criterion we incubated a fixed amount of SCCE with ALP concentrations up to a 35-fold molar excess. Using the replots of the specific velocity plot (Fig. 1, inset) the values of α = 5.6, β = 0.16, and an approximate value of Ki = 72.5 nM were calculated graphically. These values are diagnostic for hyperbolic, mixed type inhibition, i.e. a residual activity is retained by the ESI complex even at saturating inhibitor concentrations, and the inhibition type is a hybrid between competitive and noncompetitive, with a strong competitive component. The graphically determined parameters were fine tuned using Equation 4 for fitting independent data obtained at a fixed substrate concentration and variable inhibitor concentrations as shown in Fig. 2. The purpose of using Equation 4 was to consider the possibility of inhibitor depletion in the lower concentration range, a property that would invalidate the condition [I] ≃ [I]t. Since a fitting according to Equation 4 using all parameters present there would result in meaningless estimates with the few data points available, σ, α, [E]t, and υ0 were treated as known constants (α from Fig. 1), and nonlinear regression was performed considering Ki and υ∞ as the sole unknown parameters. The Ki value of ALP for SCCE was 63.1 ± 2.5 nM (r2 = 0.999), and υ∞ was 0.717 (7.1% of the uninhibited SCCE activity). Using the explicit relationship between υ∞ and υ0, υ∞ = β((1+σ)/(α+σ))υ0 (10Szedlacsek S.E. Ostafe V. Serban M. Vlad M.O. Biochem. J. 1987; 254: 311-312Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the value of β was calculated as 0.18 ± 0.02. Both Ki and β calculated with this method agree with the corresponding values calculated from the specific velocity plot, showing internal consistency.Fig. 2Inhibition of stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme (27 nM) by antileukoprotease. The substrate was MeO-Suc-Arg-Pro-Tyr-pNA (1.33 mM). Bars represent ± S.D. (n = 3), and the solid line represents the fitted curve according to Equation 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Also, aprotinin did not completely inhibit SCCE in a high molar excess (Fig. 3). Using Equation 4, the best curve fit was obtained with an α value of 1000. This indicates that inhibition of SCCE by aprotinin has a competitive, hyperbolic character, with Ki = 26.9 ± 2.5 nM (r2 = 0.995) and a residual activity corresponding to 9.8% of υ0. Eglin c inhibited the hydrolytic activity of SCCE very efficiently and completely. The mechanism corresponded to linear, competitive, tight binding inhibition, so that Equation 5 was fitted to data to obtain Ki = 0.33 ± 0.02 nM (r2 = 0.999) (Fig. 4). Eglin c was used to titrate the operational normality of SCCE. Cell shedding from human plantar stratum corneum was studied in vitro. The released corneocytes were quantified by determination of their protein content. The correlation of desquamated corneocytes and total alkali-soluble protein has previously been shown by Christensen et al. (7Christensen M.S. Nacht S. Kantor S.L. Gans E.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1978; 71: 289-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As shown in Table III, shedding from human callus was inhibited by recombinant ALP in a concentration-dependent manner. An inhibitory effect was also found for aprotinin and eglin c. In addition, elafin had only a weak inhibitory effect on cell shedding, while no significant inhibition was found for pepstatin and E-64.TABLE III.Effects of endopeptidase inhibitors on cell shedding from human callus in vitroInhibitorConcentrationInhibition ± S.E.nµm%Buffer0.0 ± 11.712Antileukoprotease5.063.2 ± 6.8aSignificantly different from the buffer control; p < 0.01.710.080.7 ± 11.4bSignificantly different from the buffer control; p < 0.001.650.096.7 ± 1.1bSignificantly different from the buffer control; p < 0.001.5Elafin5.058.0 ± 17.0cSignificantly different from the buffer control; p < 0.05.510.046.8 ± 27.24Eglin C0.571.5 ± 12.9aSignificantly different from the buffer control; p < 0.01.41.096.1 ± 3.4bSignificantly different from the buffer control; p < 0.001.4Aprotinin5.085.1 ± 8.9aSignificantly different from the buffer control; p < 0.01.310.095.2 ± 3.6aSignificantly different from the buffer control; p < 0.01.3E-64dDissolved in Me2SO.

The inactive SCCE precursor has been expressed in mammalian cells (murine C127 cells) and activated by cleavage of the propeptide with trypsin (4Hannson L. Strümquist M. Bäckman A. Wallbrandt P.

Venereol. 1993; 73: 181-184PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, SCCE mRNA is expressed in the upper spinous and granular layers of the epidermis (3Sondell B. Thornell L.-E. Stigbrand T. Egelrud T. J. Histochem. Cryochem. 1994; 42: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 5Sondell B. Thornell L.-E. Egelrud T. J. Invest.

Dermatol. 1993; 101: 200-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that inhibition of SCCE causes the concomitant complete inhibition of cell shedding from plantar stratum corneum (desquamation) in vitro (2Lundstrüm A. Egelrud T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 91: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) led to the hypothesis that SCCE may be involved in the process of physiological desquamation (1Egelrud T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 200-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lundstrüm A. Egelrud T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 91: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Sondell B.

During the present study, we purified SCCE from human callus to apparent homogeneity in SDS-PAGE (according to Egelrud, Ref. 1Egelrud T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 200-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the N-terminal amino acid sequence was found to be identical to the published data (4Hannson L. Strümquist M. Bäckman A. Wallbrandt P. Carlstein A. Egelrud T. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 269: 19420-19426Google Scholar). In accordance with the observations made by Egelrud and Lundstrüm (1Egelrud T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 200-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Egelrud T. Lundstrüm A. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1991; 283: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we could show that SCCE mainly cleaves chromogenic substrates for chymotrypsin-like enzymes. Therefore, SCCE is a potential candidate for the MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA hydrolyzing activity that can be detected on the skin surface of patients with contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis. 2O. Wiedow, unpublished observation. The regulation mechanisms of SCCE activity in the human epidermis are not known. Therefore, we isolated SCCE inhibitory activity from human plantar callus and scale material of patients with psoriasis. During partial purification it became apparent that two inhibitory activities were present, which, in addition, were also very efficient against human leukocyte elastase. Since only two efficient serine endopeptidase inhibitors are known to be present in the epidermis, namely elafin (also known as SKALP or ESI; Refs. 14Wiedow O.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4370-4375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the inhibitory properties of these acid-stable peptide inhibitors, as well as of other inhibitors, on SCCE. In contrast to the mechanism of other serine endopeptidases, SCCE inhibition by ALP was of the hyperbolic, mixed type with a strong competitive component. This means that, at saturating inhibitor concentration, a residual 7.1% of activity is still present in the presence of synthetic substrates. Nevertheless, the affinity of ALP for SCCE was high. Elafin was a weak inhibitor of SCCE both in the presence of synthetic substrates and in the cell shedding assay. The inhibitory activity of aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and ZnSO4 on SCCE was in good agreement with previous findings (1Egelrud T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 200-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Egelrud T. Lundstrüm A. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1991; 283: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the human plasma-derived serpins, α1-antichymotrypsin and α1-proteinase inhibitor, nearly completely inhibited SCCE. Eglin c, the most powerful reversible peptide inhibitor of human leukocyte elastase (13Braun N.J. Bodmer J.L. Virca G.D. Metz-Virca G. Maschler R. Bieth J.G. Schnebli H.P. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), proved also to be the strongest reversible inhibitor for SCCE described so far (Ki = 0.33 nM) and was a suitable titrant of this enzyme. On the other hand, ALP is likely to be the most relevant human inhibitor for SCCE in vivo. This inhibitor can be extracted from human stratum corneum and is constitutively produced and released from human keratinocytes in vitro (14Wiedow O. Isolierung und Charakterisierung von Serinprotease Inhibitoren der menschlichen Epidermis. Küster, Berlin1995Google Scholar). The pronounced inhibitory activity of ALP for SCCE as well as its inhibition of corneocyte shedding in vitro contrasts with the properties of the other major endopeptidase inhibitor from human skin, elafin. Besides being a weak inhibitor of SCCE, elafin is chiefly found covalently bound to proteins of the cornified envelope of corneocytes in normal stratum corneum (23Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The serpins α1-antichymotrypsin and α1-proteinase inhibitor do not occur in normal epidermis in sufficient concentrations to be relevant for physiological inhibition of SCCE. In summary, we have characterized a potent endogenous inhibitor of SCCE that may be of importance in the regulation of epidermal homeostasis. In fact, the Ki of 63 nM is likely to be of physiological significance, as substantiated by the in vitro assay in which ALP nearly completely inhibited the cell shedding of corneocytes from human callus."
https://openalex.org/W2042481436,"The activity of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV/Gr (CaMKIV/Gr) is shown to be strictly regulated by phosphorylation of three residues both in vitro and in response to antigen receptor-mediated signaling in lymphocytes. One residue, Thr-200, is indispensable for enhancement of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent basal activity by CaMKIV/Gr kinase. This event requires Ca2+/calmodulin in the full-length CaMKIV/Gr but is Ca2+/calmodulin-independent when a truncated version of CaMKIV/Gr is used as a substrate (ΔCaMKIV/Gr1-317 (Δ1-317)). The other two residues, Ser12 and Ser13, are apparently autophosphorylated by the Ca2+/calmodulin-bound CaMKIV/Gr. Phosphorylation of neither Ser12-Ser13 nor Thr312 (the residue in a homologous position to Thr286 of CaMKIIα influences the development of Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity or any other property of CaMKIV/Gr examined. Similarly, removal of the NH2-terminal 20 amino acids has no effect on the activation or function of CaMKIV/Gr. However, mutation of both Ser12 and Ser13 residues to Ala in Δ1-317 completely abrogates activity, while individual substitutions have no effect. These results indicate that the NH2-terminal Ser cluster mediates a novel type of intrasteric inhibition and suggest that three events are required for CaMKIV/Gr activation: 1) Ca2+/calmodulin binding; 2) phosphorylation of the Ca2+/calmodulin-bound enzyme on Thr200 by a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase; and 3) autophosphorylation of Ser12-Ser13. This three-step requirement is unique among the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases.

These results indicate that the NH2-terminal Ser cluster mediates a novel type of intrasteric inhibition and suggest that three events are required for CaMKIV/Gr activation: 1) Ca2+/calmodulin binding; 2) phosphorylation of the Ca2+/calmodulin-bound enzyme on Thr200 by a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase; and 3) autophosphorylation of Ser12-Ser13. This three-step requirement is unique among the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases."

INTRODUCTIONIntegrins are αβ heterodimers that mediate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 2Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). The subjects of this study are two integrins containing the β3 subunit, αvβ3 and αIIbβ3. These two integrins bind the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, and both are associated with several significant tissue remodeling events. The platelet integrin αIIbβ3 mediates platelet aggregation and also platelet adhesion to the subendothelial matrix (3Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Parise L.V. Fitzgerald L.A. Blood. 1988; 71: 831-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Scarborough R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Since platelets are a major constituent of thrombi, αIIbβ3 is thought to play a causal role in myocardial infarction, stroke, and atherogenesis. The αvβ3 integrin is expressed on osteoclasts, tumor cells, and angiogenic endothelial cells. On osteoclasts, αvβ3 directs adhesion to the bone matrix and thus initiates bone resorption (5Miyauchi A. Alvarez J. Greenfield E.M. Teti A. Grano M. Colucci S. Zambonin-Zallone A. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Cheresh D. Hruska K.A.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9901-9907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of αvβ3 on tumors is associated with their metastatic potential presumably because αvβ3 can mediate cell migration on numerous extracellular matrix proteins. The αvβ3 integrin is also apparently required for angiogenesis, and it has been postulated that inhibitors of this integrin could prevent tumor growth by interfering with tumor vascularization (7Brooks P.C. Clark R.F. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar, 8Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar).Extracellular divalent cations regulate integrin function by controlling the integrin ligand binding event. The integrins contain three different types of structural motifs that can bind divalent ions. The first type is homologous to the EF-hand Ca2+ binding motifs (9Strynadka N.C.J. James M.N.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are three or four EF-handlike sites contained within the integrin α subunits (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 10Gulino D. Boudignon C. Zhang L. Concord E. Rabiet M.-J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second metal binding motif, called an A domain is present only in selected integrin α subunits. This domain is about 200 residues in length and has considerable homology to an analogous domain in von Willebrand's factor (11Corbi A.L. Miller L.J. O'Connor K. Larson R.S. Springer T.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4023-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The recent crystallization of the A domains of two integrins, Mac-1 and LFA-1, showed that this protein module contains a divalent ion (Mg2+ or Mn2+) bound at the apex of a dinucleotide binding motif (12Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout P. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 13Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The third type of cation binding motif is present within the amino terminus of the integrin β subunits. This site, originally identified by Loftus et al. (14Loftus J.C. O'Toole T.E. Plow E.F. Glass A. Frelinger A.L. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1990; 249: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), is essential for ligand recognition and was thought to be a modified EF-hand motif. However, it is now thought that the β subunit cation binding site is similar to the metal-binding A domain in both αM and αL (12Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout P. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 13Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).Although each of these structural motifs is known to bind ions, it is not clear how all of the sites coordinate to regulate the ligand binding event. It must be emphasized that ions can have opposing effects on ligand binding to integrins. Divalent ions are certainly required for ligand binding, but in many cases Ca2+ has been shown to inhibit both ligand binding and cell adhesion (15Dransfield I. Cabanas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 16Staatz W.D. Rajpara S.M. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Santoro S.A. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9917-9925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consequently, a current challenge is to understand the distinction between the cation binding sites that promote ligand binding and those that interfere with ligand binding. Three prior reports have addressed the mechanism by which Ca2+ interferes with integrin function. Staatz et al. (16Staatz W.D. Rajpara S.M. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Santoro S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) showed that Ca2+ is a noncompetitive inhibitor of Mg2+-supported collagen binding to the α2β1 integrin, providing initial kinetic evidence that Ca2+ and Mg2+ could bind to different classes of sites on integrin. A second report by Mould et al. (18Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) also indicated the presence of functionally distinct ion binding sites, one of which promotes ligand binding and another that can suppress ligand binding. A study from this laboratory attempted to address the mechanism of cation regulation by measuring kinetic constants for the binding of natural adhesive proteins to the two β3-integrins (19Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the binding between natural adhesive proteins and the β3-integrins rapidly becomes nondissociable (20Orlando R.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19543-19550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Muller B. Zerwes H.-G. Tangemann K. Peter J. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6800-6808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we were only able to define the “apparent” association rate constant (k1app) between ligands and integrin. This rate constant is useful in that it describes the rate at which ligands become stably bound to integrin, but it is really a product of three rate constants, k1, k-1, and k2 (21Muller B. Zerwes H.-G. Tangemann K. Peter J. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6800-6808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, measuring k1app did not allow us to discern the fine kinetic detail of how divalent ions regulate ligand association and dissociation rates.In this report we advance substantially the kinetic model of how cations regulate ligand binding to both αvβ3 and αIIbβ3 by using a model antibody ligand called Fab-9. This antibody was derived from a human antibody directed against human immunodeficiency virus gp120 (22Barbas III, C.F. Hu D. Dunlop N. Sawyer L. Cababa D. Hendry R.M. Nara P.L. Burton D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3809-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, Fab-9 was engineered to contain an optimized integrin-binding RGD motif in the antigen binding site. Fab-9 was then optimized by phage display to have high affinity for both αvβ3 and αIIbβ3 (23Barbas C.F. Languino L. Smith J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10003-10007Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Smith J.W. Hu D. Satterthwait A. Pinz-Sweeny S. Barbas III, C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32788-32795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike natural adhesive proteins, which bind to integrin nondissociably, Fab-9 binds to integrin in a reversible manner. This is presumably because Fab-9 is monomeric and also because it presents only a single contact point for integrin, the RGD-containing loop in heavy chain complementarity determining region 3. The unique features of Fab-9 and the application of surface plasmon resonance to measure binding in real time allowed us to measure the effects of divalent cations on the individual kinetic constants between Fab-9 and integrin. A key assumption in this study is that Fab-9 does not bind divalent ions. We believe this to be reasonable because the antibody from which Fab-9 was engineered binds to its ligand (human immunodeficiency virus gp120) in a cation-independent manner (22Barbas III, C.F. Hu D. Dunlop N. Sawyer L. Cababa D. Hendry R.M. Nara P.L. Burton D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3809-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the current study, we measured the effects of both Ca2+ and Mg2+ on the binding of Fab-9 to both β3-integrins. In summary, this study reveals that there are two classes of cation binding sites on the two β3-containing integrins. The first class of sites promote ligand binding to integrin when occupied by divalent cations. The second class of sites are allosteric to the ligand binding site, are highly specific for Ca2+, and when occupied, increase the dissociation rate between RGD and integrin. To our knowledge this is the first evidence showing that divalent cations regulate the dissociation rate for RGD ligand.DISCUSSIONCytoplasmic factors (29Williams M.J. Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 4: 109-112Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the physiologic status of the cell (4Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Scarborough R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), and extracellular divalent cations (19Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can all influence the affinity between integrins and their ligands. Divalent cations can bind as many as five sites on the integrin (30Rivas G.A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and can promote (19Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) ligand binding. Conversely, ligand can also alter the affinity of integrin for divalent cations (31D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Ciernieswki C. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus, the binding of cations and ligands to integrins are tightly linked. The objective of this study was to elucidate the kinetic details of how divalent cations regulate ligand binding to the β3-integrins. Results from this study reveal two distinct classes of cation binding sites on the integrins. Most importantly, one class of sites is specific for Ca2+, and these sites are allosteric regulators of the ligand dissociation rate.The evidence supporting the existence of two classes of cation binding sites is as follows. First, ligand binding across a range of [Ca2+] is biphasic. At concentrations of ion below 100 µM, Ca2+ potentiates ligand binding. Higher concentrations of Ca2+ block the binding of Fab-9 to both β3-integrins. Thus, the β3-integrins contain a class of high affinity cation binding sites that promote ligand binding and a class of low affinity cation binding sites that inhibit ligand binding. A similar biphasic isotherm, although somewhat less dramatic, was observed across a range of Mn2+ (not shown), indicating that this ion also binds to both classes of binding sites. Interestingly, ligand binding as a function of Mg2+ was monophasic, with an apparent Kd for Mg2+ of 1-2 mM. This ion did not interfere with ligand binding and does not appear to interact with the inhibitory cation binding sites(s). Based on these observations, we conclude that there are two classes of cation binding sites involved in regulating the binding of Fab-9 to integrins. One class of cation binding sites promotes ligand binding and is functionally identical to the ligand-competent (LC) site we (19Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others have previously proposed (18Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The LC site can bind to Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+ and must be occupied for ligand to bind integrin. In agreement with this, studies from this laboratory also suggest that Ca2+ and Mg2+ bind the same LC that promotes ligand binding (data not shown). The other class of sites are specific for Ca2+ and interfere with ligand binding. This inhibitory Ca2+-binding site is called the I site. The I site is evident in two different types of ligand binding studies. In equilibrium binding experiments, where millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ are included in the reaction, ligand binding is suppressed. The presence of the I site can also be inferred from kinetic studies where Ca2+ dissociates ligand that is prebound to integrin. The concentration of Ca2+ required for both effects is similar (IC50 values are 1-2 mM), strongly suggesting that both effects are the result of Ca2+ occupying a single class of binding sites, the I site(s).Our results show that Ca2+ reduces the overall affinity (Kd) but not Bmax of integrin for Fab-9 (Fig. 2). Therefore, Ca2+ is a competitive inhibitor of ligand binding. More importantly, real time binding studies show that Ca2+ increases only the ligand dissociation rate. The overall affinity for ligand (Kd) is a product of the ligand association rate (k1) and dissociation rate (k-1). Calcium ion decreases the overall affinity by increasing k-1, suggesting that Ca2+ is a nonclassical inhibitor. In “pure competitive inhibition” the two competing ligands bind to a common binding site (Fig. 6A). In this case one would expect the competitor to change the affinity for ligand by influencing the ligand association rate. However, the behavior of Ca2+ is more consistent with the model shown in Fig. 6B, where the ligand binding site and the I site are distinct. The fact that Ca2+ can induce dissociation of preformed complexes between Fab-9 and integrin, in which the RGD binding site is occupied, also support the idea that the ion and ligand bind to separate sites. Consequently, the simplest interpretation of these data is that the I site and the RGD binding site are distinct and that the I site regulates the ligand off-rate by allostery. We cannot exclude the possibility that the I site and the RGD binding site may share some contact points; however, the data indicate that the I site remains capable of binding to Ca2+ even when ligand is bound to the integrin.The apparent Kd of the I site for Ca2+ is between 1 and 2 mM (Fig. 2A, Table I), so under physiologic conditions this site is probably occupied. How then, does occupation of the I site influence the binding of natural ligands to integrins? To address this issue, consideration must be given to the differences in the way that natural ligands and Fab-9 bind to integrins. The natural ligands have multiple contact points for integrin that presumably stabilize the integrin-ligand complex so that it is essentially nondissociable (20Orlando R.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19543-19550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Current thinking is that the RGD motif mediates initial contact and that ancillary contacts create a nondissociable integrin-ligand complex (32Bowditch R.D. Hariharan M. Tominna E.F. Smith J.W. Yamada K.M. Getzoff E.D. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This binding reaction has been previously described kinetically by Reaction 1 (21Muller B. Zerwes H.-G. Tangemann K. Peter J. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6800-6808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a two-step reaction leading to a stabilized integrin-ligand complex, L+R⇄k−1k1[LR]→k2LRstabilized REACTION 1where L represents ligand and R represents integrin. The ligand and integrin initially form a reversible ligand-integrin complex (LR). The second step in this reaction, described by the constant k2, leads to an irreversible complex between ligand and integrin. It is important to emphasize that k2> k1 (19Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Muller B. Zerwes H.-G. Tangemann K. Peter J. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6800-6808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, the rate of the forward reaction predominates, and the stabilized complex is the only species that can be detected using conventional binding studies.In contrast to the natural ligands, Fab-9 binds to integrins in a simple and reversible manner that can be described by Reaction 2. L+R⇌k−1k1LR REACTION 2Thus, the binding of Fab-9 is not stabilized by a secondary binding step, and there is not a kinetic constant (k2) to complicate the kinetic analysis.These differences may explain why ions do not always regulate the binding of natural ligands in this same way that they regulate the binding of Fab-9. In fact, there are even substantial differences in the way that cations appear to regulate the binding of natural ligands. Ligands like vitronectin and fibronectin bind to αvβ3 even when Ca2+ is present at millimolar concentrations (19Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the Ca2+-binding site (the I site) does not prohibit their binding to integrin. One explanation for the ability of these two proteins to bind integrin αvβ3 even in the presence of Ca2+ is that ligand and Ca2+ bind in a mutually exclusive manner. Thus, vitronectin and fibronectin may exclude Ca2+ from the I site. Other ligands like fibrinogen and osteopontin cannot bind to αvβ3 when Ca2+ is present (17Hu D. Hoyer J.R. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9917-9925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the binding of these proteins is blocked by Ca2+ binding to the I site. We suggest that Ca2+ occupation of the I site in these equilibrium reactions increases the dissociation rate to the point where it is much faster than the association rate. Therefore, the binding of these proteins to αvβ3 cannot be measured using the current approaches. Other methods, like stopped-flow technology, may be required to measure these kinetic parameters. We also measured the ability of Ca2+ to induce the dissociation of these ligands when they were prebound to αvβ3. We did not observe the induced dissociation of any natural ligands by Ca2+ (not shown). Therefore, the stabilization of ligand binding, described by the constant k2 (Reaction 1), appears to prevent the action of Ca2+ at the I site. In fact, it seems reasonable to speculate that the function of the I site could be lost as a consequence of the stabilized, or nondissociable ligand binding.Extracellular Ca2+ regulates the adhesion and morphology of osteoclasts. This observation has been taken to indicate that osteoclasts contain a Ca2+ receptor that regulates adhesion (33Miyauchi A. Hruska K.A. Greenfield E.M. Duncan R. Alvarez J. Baratollo R. Colucci S. Zambonin-Zallone A. Teitelbaum S.L. Teti A. J. Cell. Biol. 1990; 111: 2543-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 34Zaidi M. Kerby J. Huang C.L. Alam T. Rathod H. Chambers T.J. Moonga B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have previously suggested that the αvβ3 integrin may be the osteoclast Ca2+ receptor (17Hu D. Hoyer J.R. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9917-9925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). One potential function of the I site may be to regulate cellular deadhesion. As shown in Fig. 5, Ca2+ can induce the rounding up of adherent cells. This may be relevant in situations like bone resorption, where the osteoclast rounds up from the bone surface after resorption is completed. The identification of the I site on αvβ3 provides a mechanism by which Ca2+ could induce cellular deadhesion by acting directly on the integrin. One of the limitations in providing an absolute proof of this hypothesis is that natural ligands bind to purified integrin in a nondissociable manner (see above). Therefore, it is difficult to extrapolate directly from binding studies with purified protein to the conditions that exist on the cell surface. Despite the above difference, we have observed instances on whole cells, where the I site may still regulate integrin function. For example, on cells adherent to vitronectin, integrin αvβ3 clusters into focal contacts when Mg2+ is present but fails to assemble in focal contacts when Ca2+ is present. In fact, Ca2+ can induce the dissociation of the integrin from organized focal contacts (35Stuiver I. Ruggeri Z. Smith J.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In conjunction with the data presented here, it is tempting to speculate that the allosteric cation binding site regulates cell surface organization or clustering of integrins. This hypothesis is currently under investigation.We recently put forth a “displacement hypothesis” that may explain much of the regulation of ligand binding to integrins by divalent cations (31D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Ciernieswki C. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We found that just as divalent ions can regulate ligand binding affinity, ligand can also regulate divalent cation binding affinity. Specifically, we found that the addition of RGD ligand to the αIIbβ3 integrin could “displace” the binding of two of three bound Mn2+ ions. We interpreted this result to imply that ligand and divalent cation may actually compete for the same binding site on integrin. The findings in the current study provide support for the displacement hypothesis but also suggest some important modifications. The data presented here show that the binding of ligand to its site and the binding of ion to the I site are mutually exclusive. Yet, the inhibition of ligand binding by ion occupation of the I site is not “purely” competitive. In fact, a major finding of this report is that the I site is allosteric or is physically distinct from the ligand binding site. Presumably, Ca2+ binding to the I site induces a conformational change in the ligand binding site that favors ligand dissociation. Thus, the results from this study indicate that ligand and the displaced divalent cation do not necessarily bind to the same site on integrin as was implied (31D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Ciernieswki C. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Consequently, we conclude that the ligand binding site and the inhibitory Ca2+-binding I site are physically separate sites.Finally, the observations presented here have important implications for drug development. Both integrins, αvβ3 and αIIbβ3, are important pharmaceutical targets. Antagonists of αvβ3 could be used to prevent osteoporosis and perhaps tumor spread. Antagonists of αIIbβ3 have already proven efficacious in preventing thrombus formation in clinical trials. All of the current inhibitors are either monoclonal antibodies or RGD analogs that bind to the integrin's ligand binding site. The data presented here establish the inhibitory Ca2+-binding site as a rational target for inhibitors of integrin function. Antagonists that bind to this site and increase the dissociation rate for ligand may be expected to have pharmacological properties different from compounds that interact with the ligand binding pocket. INTRODUCTIONIntegrins are αβ heterodimers that mediate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 2Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). The subjects of this study are two integrins containing the β3 subunit, αvβ3 and αIIbβ3. These two integrins bind the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, and both are associated with several significant tissue remodeling events. The platelet integrin αIIbβ3 mediates platelet aggregation and also platelet adhesion to the subendothelial matrix (3Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Parise L.V. Fitzgerald L.A. Blood. 1988; 71: 831-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Scarborough R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Since platelets are a major constituent of thrombi, αIIbβ3 is thought to play a causal role in myocardial infarction, stroke, and atherogenesis. The αvβ3 integrin is expressed on osteoclasts, tumor cells, and angiogenic endothelial cells. On osteoclasts, αvβ3 directs adhesion to the bone matrix and thus initiates bone resorption (5Miyauchi A. Alvarez J. Greenfield E.M. Teti A. Grano M. Colucci S. Zambonin-Zallone A. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Cheresh D. Hruska K.A. Osteoporosis Int. 1993; 1: 132-135Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Ross F.P. Chappel J. Alvarez J.I. Sander D. Butler W.T. Farach-Carson M.C. Mintz K.A. Robey P.G. Teitelbaum S.L. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9901-9907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of αvβ3 on tumors is associated with their metastatic potential presumably because αvβ3 can mediate cell migration on numerous extracellular matrix proteins. The αvβ3 integrin is also apparently required for angiogenesis, and it has been postulated that inhibitors of this integrin could prevent tumor growth by interfering with tumor vascularization (7Brooks P.C. Clark R.F. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar, 8Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar).Extracellular divalent cations regulate integrin function by controlling the integrin ligand binding event. The integrins contain three different types of structural motifs that can bind divalent ions. The first type is homologous to the EF-hand Ca2+ binding motifs (9Strynadka N.C.J. James M.N.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are three or four EF-handlike sites contained within the integrin α subunits (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 10Gulino D. Boudignon C. Zhang L. Concord E. Rabiet M.-J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second metal binding motif, called an A domain is present only in selected integrin α subunits. This domain is about 200 residues in length and has considerable homology to an analogous domain in von Willebrand's factor (11Corbi A.L. Miller L.J. O'Connor K. Larson R.S. Springer T.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4023-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The recent crystallization of the A domains of two integrins, Mac-1 and LFA-1, showed that this protein module contains a divalent ion (Mg2+ or Mn2+) bound at the apex of a dinucleotide binding motif (12Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout P. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 13Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The third type of cation binding motif is present within the amino terminus of the integrin β subunits. This site, originally identified by Loftus et al. (14Loftus J.C. O'Toole T.E. Plow E.F. Glass A. Frelinger A.L. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1990; 249: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), is essential for ligand recognition and was thought to be a modified EF-hand motif. However, it is now thought that the β subunit cation binding site is similar to the metal-binding A domain in both αM and αL (12Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout P. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 13Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).Although each of these structural motifs is known to bind ions, it is not clear how all of the sites coordinate to regulate the ligand binding event. It must be emphasized that ions can have opposing effects on ligand binding to integrins. Divalent ions are certainly required for ligand binding, but in many cases Ca2+ has been shown to inhibit both ligand binding and cell adhesion (15Dransfield I. Cabanas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 16Staatz W.D. Rajpara S.M. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Santoro S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 17Hu D. Hoyer J.R. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9917-9925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consequently, a current challenge is to understand the distinction between the cation binding sites that promote ligand binding and those that interfere with ligand binding. Three prior reports have addressed the mechanism by which Ca2+ interferes with integrin function. Staatz et al. (16Staatz W.D. Rajpara S.M. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Santoro S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) showed that Ca2+ is a noncompetitive inhibitor of Mg2+-supported collagen binding to the α2β1 integrin, providing initial kinetic evidence that Ca2+ and Mg2+ could bind to different classes of sites on integrin. A second report by Mould et al. (18Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) also indicated the presence of functionally distinct ion binding sites, one of which promotes ligand binding and another that can suppress ligand binding. A study from this laboratory attempted to address the mechanism of cation regulation by measuring kinetic constants for the binding of natural adhesive proteins to the two β3-integrins (19Smith J.W. Piotrowicz R.S. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 960-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the binding between natural adhesive proteins and the β3-integrins rapidly becomes nondissociable (20Orlando R.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19543-19550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Muller B. Zerwes H.-G. Tangemann K. Peter J. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6800-6808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we were only able to define the “apparent” association rate constant (k1app) between ligands and integrin. This rate constant is useful in that it describes the rate at which ligands become stably bound to integrin, but it is really a product of three rate constants, k1, k-1, and k2 (21Muller B. Zerwes H.-G. Tangemann K. Peter J. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6800-6808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, measuring k1app did not allow us to discern the fine kinetic detail of how divalent ions regulate ligand association and dissociation rates.In this report we advance substantially the kinetic model of how cations regulate ligand binding to both αvβ3 and αIIbβ3 by using a model antibody ligand called Fab-9. This antibody was derived from a human antibody directed against human immunodeficiency virus gp120 (22Barbas III, C.F. Hu D. Dunlop N. Sawyer L. Cababa D. Hendry R.M. Nara P.L. Burton D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3809-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, Fab-9 was engineered to contain an optimized integrin-binding RGD motif in the antigen binding site. Fab-9 was then optimized by phage display to have high affinity for both αvβ3 and αIIbβ3 (23Barbas C.F. Languino L. Smith J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10003-10007Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Smith J.W. Hu D. Satterthwait A. Pinz-Sweeny S. Barbas III, C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32788-32795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike natural adhesive proteins, which bind to integrin nondissociably, Fab-9 binds to integrin in a reversible manner. This is presumably because Fab-9 is monomeric and also because it presents only a single contact point for integrin, the RGD-containing loop in heavy chain complementarity determining region 3. The unique features of Fab-9 and the application of surface plasmon resonance to measure binding in real time allowed us to measure the effects of divalent cations on the individual kinetic constants between Fab-9 and integrin. A key assumption in this study is that Fab-9 does not bind divalent ions. We believe this to be reasonable because the antibody from which Fab-9 was engineered binds to its ligand (human immunodeficiency virus gp120) in a cation-independent manner (22Barbas III, C.F. Hu D. Dunlop N. Sawyer L. Cababa D. Hendry R.M. Nara P.L. Burton D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3809-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the current study, we measured the effects of both Ca2+ and Mg2+ on the binding of Fab-9 to both β3-integrins. In summary, this study reveals that there are two classes of cation binding sites on the two β3-containing integrins. The first class of sites promote ligand binding to integrin when occupied by divalent cations. The second class of sites are allosteric to the ligand binding site, are highly specific for Ca2+, and when occupied, increase the dissociation rate between RGD and integrin. To our knowledge this is the first evidence showing that divalent cations regulate the dissociation rate for RGD ligand."

We previously showed that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and other agents that increase cAMP activated IGF-I gene transcription in primary rat osteoblast cultures through promoter 1 (P1), the major IGF-I promoter, and found that transcriptional induction was mediated by protein kinase A. We now have identified a short segment of P1 that is essential for full hormonal regulation and have characterized inducible DNA-protein interactions involving this site. Transient transfections of IGF-I P1 reporter genes into primary rat osteoblasts showed that the 328-base pair untranslated region of exon 1 was required for a full 5.3-fold response to PGE2; mutation in a previously footprinted site, HS3D (base pairs +193 to +215), reduced induction by 65%. PGE2 stimulated nuclear protein binding to HS3D. Binding, as determined by gel mobility shift assay, was not seen in nuclear extracts from untreated osteoblast cultures, was detected within 2 h of PGE2 treatment, and was maximal by 4 h. This DNA-protein interaction was not observed in cytoplasmic extracts from PGE2-treated cultures, indicating nuclear localization of the protein kinase A-activated factor(s). Activation of this factor was not blocked by cycloheximide (Chx), and Chx did not impair stimulation of IGF-I gene expression by PGE2. In contrast, binding to a consensus cAMP response element (CRE; 5′-TGACGTCA-3′) from the rat somatostatin gene was not modulated by PGE2 or Chx. Competition gel mobility shift analysis using mutated DNA probes identified 5′-CGCAATCG-3′ as the minimal sequence needed for inducible binding.

https://openalex.org/W2043423071,"Abstract The type I transforming growth factor-β receptor (TβR-I) is the efferent component of the receptor complex, which presumably phosphorylates intracellular targets. FKBP12, a binding protein for FK506 and rapamycin, is shown to associate with the cytoplasmic region of TβR-I in vitro. In this report, we investigated the interaction of FKBP12 with TβR-I in vivo. FKBP12 interacts with TβR-I in mammalian cells as well as in yeast. Ligand addition does not affect the interaction, and both constitutively active and kinase-negative mutants of TβR-I bind FKBP12. FKBP12 dissociates from TβR-I in the presence of a high concentration of FK506. The juxtamembrane region of TβR-I, containing the major phosphorylation sites by the type II receptor, is required for the interaction. One of the deletion mutants in this region, which was shown to mediate transcriptional response, does not bind FKBP12, suggesting that FKBP12 is not directly involved in TGF-β signaling. Furthermore TβR-I does not phosphorylate FKBP12 in vitro. FKBP12 may not be a direct substrate of TβR-I but possibly modulates the TβR-I function through its interaction with the regulatory domain of the kinase."

Mediator complex from yeast enables a response to activator proteins and also stimulates basal (unregulated) transcription (6Kim Y.-J. Bjürklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D.

Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region shares sequence homology with viral immediate early proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, such as IE62, ICP4, and IE180 of Varicella-Zoster virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and pseudorabies virus, respectively (discussed in Ref. 31Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine residues in the amino-terminal region negatively regulates transcriptional activity and affects interactions with the VP16 activation domain and with double-stranded DNA (30Ge H. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12691-12695Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M.

The sequence similarity between Tsp1 and PC4 includes the entirety of PC4, and Tsp1 shares, in addition, the capacity to stimulate basal transcription severalfold, interaction with the activation domain of Gal4-VP16 and with DNA, and modulation of these interactions by phosphorylation.Tsp1 differs from PC4 in three regards. First, it is more than twice the size, containing a carboxyl-terminal extension of unknown significance, and further differs in containing fewer amino-terminal serine residues (5 serines in 17 residues of the yeast protein, compared with 9 of 16 and 8 of 13 in the two SEAC domains of the human protein; see Ref. 31Kretzschmar M. Kaiser K. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Cell. 1994; 78: 525-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Second, Tsp1 fails to bind TFIIA, in contrast with PC4 (9Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Finally, Tsp1 had no effect on the level of activated transcription in the yeast system, whereas PC4 enables as much as 90-fold transcriptional enhancement in the human system (9Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The difference in regard to transcriptional activation may relate to the use of mediator complex but not TAFs for studies of activation in the yeast system and TAFs but not mediator in the human system. While TAFs are also present in yeast, their actions may be promoter specific, and TAF-dependent promoters remain to be identified, so investigation of Tsp1 in regard to TAF-dependent transcriptional activation is not yet possible.Following completion of this manuscript, an independent characterization of Tsp1 was reported (33Knaus R. Pollock R. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The protein, termed Sub1, was identified as a suppressor of a cold-sensitive TFIIB mutation, and overexpression of Sub1 was shown to stimulate transcriptional activation in vivo. It was further demonstrated that the protein interacted with TFIIB in vitro and inhibited the formation of TBP-TFIIB-promoter complexes. The genetic characterization of Sub1 complements our biochemical analysis and further suggests that this protein may play a role in transcriptional activation. INTRODUCTIONA set of general transcription factors required for initiation at most RNA polymerase II promoters has been isolated from yeast and mammalian cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Conaway R.C.

All 15 polypeptides of this minimal set of protein factors exhibit significant homology between yeast and human systems. Functional attributes of the protein factors so far determined are similar in the two systems as well.Additional proteins are required for positive regulation (activation) of transcription by enhancer-binding proteins (reviewed in Refs. 3Tjian R.

Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Mediator complex from yeast enables a response to activator proteins and also stimulates basal (unregulated) transcription (6Kim Y.-J. Bjürklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 7Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). A human cofactor of activated transcription, termed USA, comprises several components, including PC4, which stimulates basal transcription as well (8Meisterernst M. Roy A.L. Lieu H.M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 66: 981-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 9Ge H. Roeder R.G.

We report here on the isolation and characterization of this protein and the cloning and expression of the gene that encodes it.

The structure of DAT was studied using the photoaffinity compounds [125I]1-[2-(diphenylmethoxy)-ethyl]-4-[2-(4-azido-3-iodophenyl)ethyl]piperazine ([125I]DEEP), a 1-(2-diphenylmethoxy)-ethyl-4-(3-phenyl propyl)piperazine (GBR analog), and [125I]-3β-(p-chlorophenyl)tropane-2β-carboxylic acid, 4′-azido-3′-iodophenylethyl ester ([125I]RTI 82), a cocaine analog, which had been shown in a previous study to become incorporated into different regions of the DAT primary sequence. The proximity of the photolabeled binding sites to integral membrane structures was investigated by subjecting photolabeled membrane suspensions to limited proteolysis with trypsin and separately analyzing the resulting membranes and supernatants for the presence of photolabeled DAT fragments. Trypsin treatment of [125I] DEEP-labeled membranes generated labeled 45- and 14-kDa DAT fragments that immunoprecipitated with an epitope-specific antiserum generated against amino acids 42-59 near the first putative transmembrane domain, whereas [125I]RTI 82 was found in 32- and 16-kDa tryptic fragments that precipitated with an antiserum directed against a sequence near transmembrane domain 4 (amino acids 225-238). All of the photolabeled fragments were recovered in the protease-treated membranes, indicating that they possess integral membrane structures that prevent their release from the membrane as soluble forms. The size of the two smallest fragments in conjunction with their retention in the membrane suggests that incorporation of the photoaffinity ligands occurs in or near membrane spanning regions and delineates the maximum possible distance between the transmembrane structures, incorporated photolabel, and antibody epitopes. Carbohydrate analysis of the fragments identified sialic acids and N-linked oligosaccharides exclusively on the 45-kDa [125I]DEEP-labeled fragment, which, based on size, would be expected to contain four consensus glycosylation sites between putative transmembrane domains 3 and 4. Photoaffinity labeling after trypsin treatment of membranes showed that the larger but not the smaller fragments retain binding capacity, as the 45- and 32-kDa fragments were capable of becoming photolabeled. Binding of photoaffinity ligands at these fragments was displaced with the same pharmacology as that of intact DATs. These results verify numerous aspects of DAT structure and topology heretofore only predicted from theoretical considerations and extend our knowledge of DAT structure-function properties.

The working model for the topological orientation of the protein places the N and C termini intracellularly, three or four of the glycosylation sites extracellularly, and several consensus phosphorylation sites intracellularly (Fig. 1). dopamine transporters [125I]1-[2-(diphenylmethoxy)-ethyl]-4-[2-(4-azido-3-iodophenyl)ethyl]piperazine 1-(2-diphenylmethoxy)-ethyl-4-(3-phenyl propyl)piperazine [125I]-3β-(p-chlorophenyl)tropane2β-carboxylic acid, 4′-azido-3′-iodophenylethyl ester [3H](−)-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane norepinephrine transporter, TMD transmembrane domain 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The psychotropic drugs cocaine and amphetamine inhibit dopamine reuptake, and the binding of cocaine by DAT is presumed to underlie its reinforcing effects (Ritz et al., 29Ritz M.C. Lamb R.J. Goldberg S.R. Kuhar M.J. Science. 1987; 237: 1219-1223Google Scholar). Numerous other structurally diverse compounds such as N-[1-(2-benzo(b)thiophenyl)cyclohexyl]-piperidine, mazindol, and GBR compounds are also high affinity dopamine uptake blockers and are competitors in DAT ligand binding assays. Although the binding properties of these compounds at DAT have been extensively characterized (Berger et al., 2Berger P. Elsworth J.P. Reith M.E.A. Tanen D. Roth R.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 176: 251-252Google Scholar; Madras et al., 20Madras B.K. Spealman R.D. Fahey M.A. Neumeyer J.L. Saha J.K. Milius R.A. Mol.

Elucidation of these properties at a molecular level could yield insight into the basis of DAT action and provide information useful for the development of therapeutic cocaine treatments. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified specific amino acid residues important for binding of the cocaine analog [3H]CFT in TMD 4 (Wang et al., 40Wang J.B. Davis S. Uhl G. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1993; 19: 745Google Scholar), for dopamine transport and [3H]CFT binding in TMD 1 (Kitayama et al., 17Kitayama S. Shimada S. Xu H. Markham L. Donovan D.M. Uhl G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Synapse. 1993; 15: 58-62Google Scholar). Functional studies performed using chimeras of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters suggest that the N-terminal region of the protein (TMDs 1-4) provides an essential transport activity, that the middle third of the protein (TMDs 5-8) functions in cocaine binding, and that more C-terminal regions (TMDs 11-12) are involved in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium transport (Giros et al., 11Giros B.

A. 1995; 91: 12584-12588Google Scholar). DAT functional domains have also been studied using photoaffinity ligands based on two of the aforementioned classes of uptake blockers, [125I]DEEP, a GBR analog, and [125I]RTI 82, a cocaine analog. Epitope-specific immunoprecipitation of proteolytic fragments generated from SDS-solubilized DATs showed that [125I]DEEP was incorporated near the first two putative transmembrane domains, whereas [125I]RTI 82 was localized to the C-terminal half of the protein (Vaughan, 38Vaughan R.A. Mol. Pharm. 1995; 47: 956-964Google Scholar). The present report describes an extension of this earlier peptide mapping study modified to investigate the relationship of the photolabeled domains to transmembrane structures. This was done by performing the proteolytic treatment on membrane suspensions rather than solubilized DAT samples and separately analyzing the resulting membrane and supernatant fractions for photolabeled DAT fragments. Proteolytic fragments containing integral membrane structures will be retained by the membranes, whereas those lacking membrane structures will be rendered soluble and will be released into the supernatant (Herald et al., 14Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Google Scholar). The data presented in this report demonstrate that proteolyzed DAT domains containing either [125I]DEEP or [125I]RTI 82 remain in the membrane and thus contain integral membrane structures. The small size of two of the fragments indicates that the photoaffinity ligands are incorporated in, or in close proximity to, these transmembrane structures and verifies the position of at least one transmembrane domain in each of these fragments in terms of its maximum possible distance from the incorporated ligand and antibody epitope. While the site of incorporation of the ligands within the primary sequence was consistent with the findings of the previous study, the methodological differences resulted in the production of two novel fragments that yielded additional information relative to the site of [125I]RTI 82 incorporation and to sites of glycosylation. It was also found that the two larger DAT tryptic fragments retained the ability to bind photoaffinity ligands and pharmacological displacers. Rat striatal membranes were homogenized in 10 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.32 sucrose, centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 12 min, and resuspended in the same buffer at a concentration of 6.7 mg/ml original wet weight as described previously (Vaughan, 38Vaughan R.A. Mol. Pharm. 1995; 47: 956-964Google Scholar). [125I]DEEP, or [125I]RTI 82 (specific activity 1100-1800 Ci/mmol) was added to a final concentration of 5 n, the suspensions were incubated on ice for 60 min, and then irradiated with ultraviolet light for 45 s. Membranes were washed twice with 50 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and resuspended in this buffer at a final concentration of 50 mg/ml (original wet weight). 25 µl of the membrane suspension prepared as above was treated for 5 min at 22°C with 25 µl of trypsin prepared in 50 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Final trypsin concentrations ranged from 1 to 200 µg/ml as indicated specifically in the figure legends. At the end of the incubation, soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to equal the concentration of trypsin, and samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min (Fig. 2, Fig. 3) or 10,000 × g for 5 min (remainder of experiments). Supernatants were removed for analysis or were discarded, and the membrane pellets were solubilized with 25 µl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (60 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 10 m dithiothreitol, and 0.5% SDS). Solubilized membranes were analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography, either directly or after immunoprecipitation.Fig. 3Tryptic membranes and supernatants from [125I]RTI 82-labeled DATs. Membranes labeled with [125I]RTI 82 were treated with buffer (lane 1), 20 µg/ml trypsin (lane 2), or 200 µg/ml trypsin (lane 3). At the end of the treatment, membranes were pelleted by centrifugation; supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and samples were either electrophoresed directly (lanes 1-6) or were immunoprecipitated with serum 5 (lanes 7-12). Lanes 1-3, membranes; lanes 4-6, supernatants from membranes in lanes 1-3; lanes 7-9, immunoprecipitation of lanes 1-3; lanes 10-12, immunoprecipitation of lanes 4-6. The polyacrylamide concentration of this gel was 17%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For some experiments, unlabeled membranes were treated with trypsin followed by photolabeling. For these assays, membranes were treated with trypsin exactly as described above, and the supernatants were discarded. The trypsin-treated membranes were resuspended in the sucrose-phosphate buffer followed by the photolabeling and immunoprecipitation procedures. The epitope-specific antisera used in this study were generated against the following regions of the DAT-deduced amino acid sequence: peptide 15, amino acids 6-30; peptide 16, amino acids 42-59; peptide 5, amino acids 225-236; peptide 12, amino acids 541-550; peptide 18, amino acids 580-608 (Fig. 1). The sera were coded with the same number as the immunizing peptide and were determined to be specific for DAT based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblots, immunoprecipitations, and immunohistochemistry as described elsewhere (Vaughan et al., 39Vaughan R.A. Uhl G. Kuhar M.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1993; 4: 209-215Google Scholar; Freed et al., 9Freed C. Revay R. Vaughan R. Kreik E. Kuhar M. Uhl G. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 359: 340-349Google Scholar; Vaughan, 38Vaughan R.A. Mol. Pharm. 1995; 47: 956-964Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, SDS-solubilized membranes were diluted to a final SDS concentration of 0.1% using immunoprecipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, plus 0.05% SDS and 0.1% Triton X-100). To avoid loading large amounts of IgG onto the gels, the DAT antisera were covalently coupled to the protein A-Sepharose beads using the cross-linking reagent dimethyl pimelimidate prior to use in immunoprecipitations (Schneider et al., 30Schneider C. Newman R.A. Sutherland D.R. Asser U. Greaves M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10766-10769Google Scholar). Each sample of diluted, solubilized membranes was incubated with 30 µl of precoupled protein A-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4°C; the beads were washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer, and DAT samples were eluted from the beads with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were analyzed on 15% polyacrylamide gels unless otherwise indicated. For peptide blocking experiments precoupled beads were preincubated for 15 min with either no addition, the immunizing peptide, or an irrelevant peptide prior to adding the DAT sample. The irrelevant peptides used for those experiments were either peptide 4 (amino acids 162-172) or peptide 11 (amino acids 505-516) (Vaughan et al., 39Vaughan R.A. Uhl G. Kuhar M.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1993; 4: 209-215Google Scholar). High and low range Rainbow molecular weight markers from Amersham Corp. were standards on all gels. All immunoprecipitation results reported were produced in two or more independent experiments. Photolabeled, trypsinized samples were immunoprecipitated as described through the step of washing the protein A-Sepharose beads. At that point the beads were incubated with 30 µl of 25 m Tris glycine, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, 0.7% Nonidet P-40, and 5 m EDTA, with or without the addition of 0.3 units of N-glycanase and/or 0.01 unit of neuraminidase. For the coincubation treatments, the neuraminidase treatment was done first for 60 min followed by the addition of the N-glycanase. Samples were incubated overnight at 22°C, followed by elution of DAT samples from the beads with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analysis by electrophoresis and autoradiography. [125I]DEEP and [125I]RTI 82 were synthesized by Dr. F. I. Carrol, Research Triangle Park, NC, and radioiodinated by Dr. John Lever, Johns Hopkins University, as described previously (Grigoriadis et al., 13Grigoriadis D.E. Wilson A.A. Lew R. Sharkey J.S. Kuhar M.J. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 2664-2670Google Scholar; Patel et al., 24Patel A. Boja J.W. Lever J. Lew R. Simantov R. Carroll F.I. Lewin A.H. Philip A. Gao Y. Kuhar M.J. Brain Res. 1992; 576: 173-174Google Scholar). Trypsin was from Boehringer Mannheim; soybean trypsin inhibitor was from Sigma; protein A-Sepharose CL 4B was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; dimethyl pimelimidate was from Pierce, and N-glycanase and neuraminidase were from Genzyme. GBR 12935 was obtained from Research Biochemicals, and mazindol and (−)-cocaine were obtained from NIDA (Baltimore, MD). The effect of trypsin treatment on [125I]DEEP-labeled membranes is shown in Fig. 2. Lanes 1-3 contain control or trypsin-treated membranes, and the corresponding supernatants from these samples are in lanes 4-6. Most of the radioactivity remained in the membrane fraction, and only a negligible amount of radioactivity was released from the membranes into the supernatants. Some proteolytic degradation and redistribution of radiolabel from higher to lower molecular weight forms can be observed. Although the identity of photolabeled DAT in these preparations is known from pharmacological and immunological evidence (Grigoriadis et al., 13Grigoriadis D.E. Wilson A.A. Lew R. Sharkey J.S. Kuhar M.J. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 2664-2670Google Scholar; Patel et al., 24Patel A. Boja J.W. Lever J. Lew R. Simantov R. Carroll F.I. Lewin A.H. Philip A. Gao Y. Kuhar M.J.

Neurosci. 1993; 4: 209-215Google Scholar), the presence of many nonspecifically photolabeled proteins made it necessary to immunoprecipitate the samples to identify the DAT proteolytic fragments. Immunoprecipitation of the membranes and supernatants in lanes 1-6 with DAT antiserum 16 is shown in lanes 7-12. Both unproteolyzed full-length DAT (lane 7) and 45- and 14-kDa DAT fragments (lanes 8 and 9) were quantitatively recovered from membranes, whereas no fragments were detected in the soluble fractions (lanes 10-12). The proteolytic pattern shown here was extremely reproducible. Treatment of membranes with 1 µg/ml trypsin generated approximately equal amounts of full-length DAT and the 45-kDa fragment (lane 8), whereas at 10 µg/ml trypsin, most of the full-length DAT was gone, and the radioactivity was distributed relatively equally between the 45- and 14-kDa fragments (lane 9; see also Fig. 4). Further characterization of these fragments is presented in Fig. 4, Fig. 5.Fig. 5Specificity of immunoprecipitation of [125I]DEEP tryptic fragments. [125I]DEEP-labeled membranes were treated with 10 µg/ml trypsin, and supernatants were removed. Samples were immunoprecipitated with the DAT antisera shown along the top. The sera received pretreatments of no addition (0), the immunizing peptide (specific for each serum as indicated), or an irrelevant peptide (peptide 11), as shown at the bottom, prior to adding the proteolyzed sample. Final peptide concentrations were 200 µg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Tryptic proteolysis of [125I]RTI 82-labeled membranes (Fig. 3) produced a comparable result in that, while degradation of photolabeled proteins was apparent in the membrane samples (lanes 1-3), essentially no radioactivity was released into the supernatants (lanes 4-6). Immunoprecipitation of the samples in lanes 1-6 with DAT antiserum 5 (lanes 7-12) shows that DAT and DAT fragments were recovered exclusively from membranes (lanes 7-9). The fragments generated from [125I]RTI 82-labeled DAT migrated at about 32 and 16 kDa and are characterized in Fig. 6, Fig. 7.Fig. 7Specificity of immunoprecipitation of [125I]RTI 82 tryptic fragments. [125I]RTI 82-labeled membranes were treated with 20 µg/ml trypsin, and supernatants were removed. Samples were immunoprecipitated with the sera shown along the top.

Final peptide concentrations were 200 µg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Full trypsin dose-response curves and time course studies were performed for DATs labeled with each ligand, and only the optimal conditions are shown. At these trypsin concentrations proteolysis was complete in 5 min. The supernatants from the trypsin-treated membranes labeled with both ligands were analyzed with all five of the epitope-specific antisera, but no immunoprecipitable photolabeled fragments were found. Proteolysis of membrane preparations was also examined using V8 protease. While this was the optimal enzyme in the previous study for the SDS-solubilized DATs, it was substantially less effective than trypsin in the membrane suspensions. Because the DAT fragments were found entirely in the membrane fraction, subsequent experiments used only membranes from which the tryptic supernatants had been removed. Although the [125I]DEEP and [125I]RTI 82 fragments generated by V8 protease from SDS-solubilized DATs were immunologically characterized in the previous study, this analysis was re-done for the present study. This was warranted because of the methodological differences between the studies, because the sizes of the proteolytic fragments differed somewhat between the studies, and because [125I]RTI 82 fragments were generated that were smaller than in the previous study. Immunological characterization of the [125I]DEEP fragments generated at two concentrations of trypsin is shown in Fig. 4. The intact DATs remaining after proteolysis (that migrate at about 97 kDa on these high concentration gels) were immunoprecipitated by all five antisera (lanes 1-5 and 7-11) but not by preimmune serum (lanes 6 and 12). The 45-kDa fragment was precipitated with sera 15 and 16 (lanes 1, 2, 7, and 8) but not by the others, and the 14-kDa fragment was precipitated exclusively by serum 16 (lane 8). A lightly labeled fragment at about 32 kDa was precipitated by sera 5, 12, and 18 (lanes 3-5 and 9-11) but not by sera 15 and 16. Precipitation of all fragments with the indicated sera is specific because none of the fragments was recognized by preimmune serum (lanes 6 and 12), and because for all fragments, precipitation was blocked by the inclusion of the immunizing peptide (Fig. 5, center lane of each set) but not an irrelevant peptide (Fig. 5, right lane of each set). Occasionally other minor fragments (e.g. at about 26 kDa) were observed, but their appearance was not reproducible and their characterization was not pursued. Analysis of [125I]RTI 82 tryptic fragments is shown in Fig. 6. Again, the intact DATs precipitated with all immune but not preimmune sera. The fragment at 32 kDa precipitated with sera 5, 12, and 18 (lanes 3-5, and 9-11) but not with sera 15 and 16, whereas the 16-kDa fragment was recognized only by serum 5 (lanes 3 and 9). None of these fragments was precipitated with preimmune serum (lanes 6 and 12), and inclusion of the immunizing peptide (Fig. 7, center lane of each set) but not an irrelevant peptide (Fig. 7, right lane of each set) blocked precipitation of these fragments. Other minor fragments that were not characterized were also observed in these experiments. The photolabeled fragments were analyzed for the presence of carbohydrates by treatment with N-glycanase and neuraminidase, which cleave asparagine-linked oligosaccharides and terminal sialic acids, respectively. [125I]DEEP and [125I]RTI 82-labeled DAT fragments were immunoprecipitated and then treated with these enzymes (Fig. 8). The full-length DATs in these samples (lanes 1 and 5) lose about 25 kDa after N-glycanase treatment (lanes 2 and 6) and about 5 kDa after treatment with neuraminidase (lanes 3 and 7). Use of both enzymes together produces a band that migrates at about 50 kDa (lanes 4 and 8). The 45-kDa [125I]DEEP-labeled fragment underwent parallel reductions in molecular mass with these treatments (lane 1-4), resulting in a band that migrated at 25-30 kDa after deglycosylation with both enzymes. The electrophoretic mobilities of the 14-kDa [125I]DEEP-labeled fragment and the 32-kDa [125I]RTI 82-labeled fragment were unaffected. Assessment of the functional properties of the proteolytic fragments was done by performing photoaffinity labeling after trypsin treatment of membranes (Fig. 9). Unlabeled membranes were treated with 10 µg/ml trypsin for subsequent [125I]DEEP labeling or 20 µg/ml trypsin for subsequent [125I]RTI 82 labeling. After removal of supernatants, the membranes were resuspended and subjected to photoaffinity labeling followed by immunoprecipitation with serum 16 for [125I]DEEP-labeled samples or serum 5 for [125I]RTI 82-labeled samples. Pre-photolabeled membranes were treated with trypsin, immunoprecipitated, and electrophoresed in parallel with the experimental samples. DATs pre-labeled with [125I]DEEP (lane 1) produced the characteristic 45- and 14-kDa fragments when treated with 10 µg/ml trypsin (lane 2). When unlabeled membranes received the same trypsin treatment followed by photolabeling, both full-length DAT and the 45-kDa fragment became labeled (lane 3). The 14-kDa fragment did not become photolabeled even though it was present as determined by the pre-photolabeled sample. Although the labeling of the 45-kDa fragment relative to the intact DAT form is modest in this experiment, in most other experiments it labeled more strongly (e.g. Fig. 10). The parallel analysis using [125I]RTI 82 to label proteolyzed DAT is shown in lanes 4-9. Membranes pre-photolabeled with [125I]RTI 82 and then treated with trypsin produced the previously described 32- and 16-kDa fragments (lanes 4-6). Unlabeled membranes treated with trypsin and then subjected to photolabeling with [125I]RTI 82 produced labeled full-length DAT and the 32-kDa fragment (lanes 7-9). The 16-kDa fragment was not observed to become labeled after proteolysis, even upon long exposures of the films. Further analysis of the function of these fragments involved examination of their pharmacological properties (Fig. 10). Photoaffinity labeling of tryptic fragments with [125I]DEEP (lanes 1-4) or [125I]RTI 82 (lanes 5-8) was performed in the presence of no displacer (lanes 1 and 5), 30 µ (−)-cocaine (lanes 2 and 6), 1 µ GBR 12935 (lanes 3 and 7), or 1 µ mazindol (lanes 4 and 8).

We therefore predicted that mutations at Lys165 and Lys166 should have no effect on the activation of Gla domainless FX. To test this hypothesis, we mutated both residues Lys165 and Lys166 of TF to Ala, Glu, or Gln and examined the ability of these double mutants to support FVIIa-mediated activation of FX, Gla domainless FX, and factor IX (FIX). Each TF mutant was equivalent to wild-type TF in both FVIIa binding and promotion of FVIIa amidolytic activity. However, all three mutants were markedly deficient in supporting FIX and FX activation, with FX activation rates decreased more than FIX activation rates.

Studies were carried out at pH 2.75 over a chloride concentration range of 1-100 mM and at pH 4.80 over a chloride concentration range of 100-400 mM. Competition studies involved successive pairwise comparisons of substrates of increasing enzyme specificity. The orders of specificities, ba > 2cd > ap > cat > tmp at pH 2.75 and ba > 2cd > NADH > ap > cat > tmp at pH 4.80, are the same for both the CPO-H2O2-Cl and hypochlorite-Cl systems.

In all comparisons except ap versus cat, the specificity of the CPO-H2O2-Cl system toward the preferred substrate is higher than that of the hypochlorite-Cl system. Quantitative comparisons between specificities of CPO-H2O2-Cl and hypochlorite-Cl systems indicate that at least 98% of the CPO-catalyzed halogenation reactions of ba, 2cd, NADH, and ap occur by mechanisms in which the substrate reacts directly with the enzyme. Thus, less than 2% of any of the CPO reactions could possibly involve a free oxidized halogen intermediate.

Virol. 1992; 73: 313-321Google Scholar; Wu et al., 38Wu C.A. Nelson N.J. McGeoch D.J. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 435-443Google Scholar). These seven gene products comprise a highly processive heterodimeric DNA polymerase (UL30/UL42 genes), a heterotrimeric DNA helicase-primase (UL5/UL8/UL52 genes), a single-strand DNA-binding protein (SSB) (UL29 gene), and an origin-binding protein (UL9 gene) (reviewed by Challberg (10Challberg M.D. Semin. Virol. 1991; 2: 247-256Google Scholar)). herpes simplex virus type-1 single-strand DNA-binding protein E. coli SSB N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-3-propanesulfonic acid. HSV-1 SSB, henceforth referred to as ICP8 (infected cell olypeptide 8), is a 128-kDa zinc metalloprotein (Gupte et al., 16Gupte S.S. Olson J.W. Ruyechan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11413-11416Google Scholar). It is a functional homologue of Escherichia coli SSB (E-SSB) (Lohman and Ferrari, 21Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Google Scholar), capable of binding to single-strand DNA cooperatively and with high affinity (Lee and Knipe, 19Lee C.K. Knipe D.M. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 731-738Google Scholar; Ruyechan, 29Ruyechan R.T. J. Virol. 1983; 46: 661-666Google Scholar). The DNA-binding site size for ICP8 is based on indirect measurements. Estimates based on the ratios of ICP8 required for stimulation of the HSV-1 DNA polymerase, strand displacement activity, and nuclease protection fall in the range of one ICP8 to 12-22 nucleotides (Boehmer and Lehman, 6Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67 (b): 711-715Google Scholar; Hernandez and Lehman, 17Hernandez T.R. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11227-11232Google Scholar; O'Donnell et al., 26O'Donnell M.E. Elias P. Funnell B.E. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4260-4266Google Scholar). They are consistent with a site size of 15-18 nucleotides estimated by electron microscopy (Makhov et al., 24Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 789-799Google Scholar). In addition to its role as an SSB, ICP8 participates in multiple protein-protein interactions that are probably significant during viral DNA replication (Boehmer and Lehman, 5Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90 (a): 8444-8448Google Scholar; Boehmer et al., 8Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 11227-11232Google Scholar; Liptak et al., 20Liptak L.M. Uprichard S.L. Knipe D.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1759-1767Google Scholar; Lukonis and Weller, 23Lukonis C.J. Weller S.K. J.

Powell K.L. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 501-508Google Scholar). The HSV-1 DNA helicase-primase is thought to be responsible for DNA unwinding and priming of Okazaki fragments at the DNA replication fork (Crute et al., 13Crute J.J. Tsurumi T. Zhu L. Weller S.K. Olivo P.D. Challberg M.D. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2186-2189Google Scholar). The core enzyme consists of the 99-kDa UL5 and 114-kDa UL52 gene products and possesses 5′→ 3′ DNA helicase, DNA-dependent nucleoside triphosphatase, and primase activities (Calder and Stow, 9Calder J.M. Stow N.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3573-3578Google Scholar; Dodson and Lehman, 14Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1105-1109Google Scholar). The primase activity exhibits sequence preference, with the predominant template site in φX174 DNA being 3′-AGCCCTCCCA, with primer synthesis initiating at the underlined C residue (Tenney et al., 35Tenney D.J. Sheaffer A.K. Hurlburt W.W. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9129-9136Google Scholar). The 80-kDa UL8 gene product lacks detectable enzymatic and DNA binding activities (Dodson and Lehman, 14Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1105-1109Google Scholar; Parry et al., 28Parry M.E. Stow N.D. Marsden H.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 607-612Google Scholar), but has been reported to stimulate primer synthesis by the UL5/52 core enzyme (Tenney et al., 34Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar). In addition, it has been proposed that UL8 protein increases utilization of primers synthesized by the UL5/52 proteins (Sherman et al., 31Sherman G. Gottlieb J. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4884-4892Google Scholar). This work is a further investigation into the role of the UL8 subunit. We have examined the effects of UL8 protein on the activities of the UL5/52 proteins in the presence of ICP8. Our results show that UL8 protein is required for optimal DNA helicase, DNA-dependent ATPase, and primase activities in the presence of ICP8. Consequently, we propose that UL8 protein mediates an interaction between ICP8 and the UL5/52 proteins, increasing the utilization of ICP8-covered DNA templates. Phosphoenolpyruvate (potassium salt) and NADH were purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN and Amersham Corp., respectively. Deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides (ultrapure) with the exception of ATP were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. ATP (lithium salt), leupeptin, pepstatin, and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. E. coli SSB was obtained from both Pharmacia Biotech Inc. and U. S. Biochemical Corp. Sequenase Version 2.0 and bovine serum albumin (DNase-free) were purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. and Pharmacia Biotech Inc., respectively. Rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, as solutions in 50% glycerol, were obtained from Sigma. Standards for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were obtained from Bio-Rad. ICP8, UL8 protein, and the UL5/52 core enzyme were purified from total cell extracts of Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 cells infected with Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus recombinant for the HSV-1 UL29, UL8, and UL5/UL52 genes, respectively (Dodson et al., 15Dodson M.S. Crute J.J. Bruckner R.C. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20835-20838Google Scholar; Stow, 33Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 313-321Google Scholar). Stocks of recombinant A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus were prepared in S. frugiperda Sf9 cells as described (Skaliter and Lehman, 32Skaliter R. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10665-10669Google Scholar). Sf21 cells were propagated and infected as described (Skaliter and Lehman, 32Skaliter R. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10665-10669Google Scholar). 48 h (UL8 protein and UL5/52 proteins) or 60 h (ICP8) post-infection, cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen at −80°C. All subsequent manipulations were performed on ice or at 4°C in buffers containing 0.5 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 µg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 m phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 m KCl, and 1.5 m MgCl2) and allowed to swell for 20 min. The cells were lysed with 10 strokes of a tight-fitting pestle (A), and NaCl was added to 1.2. After a 30-min extraction, the debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 60 min in a Beckman type 42.1 rotor. Supernatants were dialyzed twice against 2 liters of buffer B (20 m HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.6, 1 m dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 m EDTA) containing 0.1 (ICP8), 50 m (UL8 protein), or 60 m (UL5/52 proteins) NaCl to give fraction I. All chromatography steps were performed using a Pharmacia FPLC system at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. ICP8 was purified as described previously (Boehmer and Lehman, 5Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90 (a): 8444-8448Google Scholar). At each stage during the purification of UL8 protein and the UL5/52 core enzyme, chromatography fractions were assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining and by immunoblotting using rabbit sera raised against UL8 protein and the UL5/52 core enzyme (courtesy of I. R. Lehman, Stanford University). Final purity was assessed by densitometric scanning of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. UL8 protein fraction I was loaded onto a 5-ml Econo-Pac HTP cartridge (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer C (50 m imidazole HCl, pH 7.0, 1 m dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 50 m NaCl). The column was washed; proteins were eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (0-390 m) in buffer C; and 1-ml fractions were collected. Fractions 7-16, containing the peak of UL8 protein, eluting at ∼75 m ammonium sulfate, were pooled and dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer D (20 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 m EDTA) containing 50 m NaCl to give fraction II. Fraction II was applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with buffer D containing 50 m NaCl. The column was washed, and proteins were eluted with a 10-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0.05-0.5) in buffer D. Fractions (0.25 ml) containing near homogeneous (>95% pure) UL8 protein, eluting at ∼0.3 NaCl, were divided into aliquots, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. The yield of purified UL8 protein was ∼3.5 mg from 2.5 g of cell paste. UL5/52 proteins fraction I was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap heparin column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with buffer B containing 60 m NaCl. The column was washed; proteins were eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient of NaCl (60-600 m) in buffer B; and 1-ml fractions were collected. Fractions 13-28, containing the bulk of UL5/52 proteins, were pooled (fraction II) and applied directly to a 5-ml Econo-Pac HTP cartridge equilibrated with buffer E (10 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 m dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 NaCl). The column was washed; proteins were eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient of sodium phosphate (0.01-0.2) in buffer E; and 1-ml fractions were collected. The column flow-through fraction and fractions 1-12, containing the majority of UL5/52 proteins, were pooled and dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer D containing 50 m NaCl to give fraction III. Fraction III was applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated with buffer D containing 50 m NaCl. The column was washed, and proteins were eluted with a 10-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0.05-0.4), followed by a 1 NaCl step, both in buffer D. Fractions (0.25 ml) containing near homogeneous (>95% pure) UL5/52 proteins, eluting in the 1 NaCl step, were divided into aliquots, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. The yield of purified UL5/52 proteins was ∼4.5 mg from 7.5 g of cell paste. Protein concentrations were determined by using extinction coefficients of 82,720, 130,390, and 171,380 −1 cm−1 at 280 nm for ICP8, UL8 protein, and UL5/52 proteins, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the purified ICP8, UL5/52 proteins, and UL8 protein used in this study. The lower molecular weight species present in the protein preparations were confirmed as proteolytic degradation products by immunoblot analysis. φX174 virion DNA was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Random hexamer oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer and purified by electrophoresis through denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Sambrook et al., 30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The sequences of the oligodeoxyribonucleotides used in this study are shown in Table I. The 90-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide was formed by ligating 14-mer (residues 1-14), 8-mer (residues 15-22), and 68-mer (residues 23-90) oligodeoxyribonucleotides using a 65-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide (complementary to residues 10-74) as a scaffold. The product was purified by electrophoresis through denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Sambrook et al., 30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The DNA helicase substrate was constructed by annealing 5′-32P-labeled 59-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide (residues 26-59 are complementary to residues 1-34 of the 90-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide) to the 90-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide. This produced a Y-shaped partial DNA duplex molecule that possesses a 25-nucleotide 5′-32P-tail that serves as a loading site for the 5′→ 3′ translocation of the UL5/52 DNA helicase.TABLE IOligodeoxyribonucleotides used in this studyNameSequencePB-105′-GTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGACCTGCAGGCATGCCGGTACCGCTTTTGCGGTACCG59-mer5′-TGTTGGTTCTCGTATGCTGCCGGTCTGCCGAATTCACACCGCCGGCGCCCACCACCACC90-mer5′-GGTGGTGGTGGGCGCCGGCGGTGTGAATTCGGCACTGGCCGTCGTATGCTCTTGGTTGTAGGATCCCAGCACATTGAAGGATGCATGGTG Open table in a new tab DNA helicase activity was measured by quantitating the displacement of 5′-32P-labeled 59-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide using the Y-shaped DNA substrate. Reactions (10 µl) were performed at 37°C in 20 m HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 m dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 4.5 m MgCl2 containing 3 m ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 15 n (molecules) DNA substrate, a 5-10-fold molar excess of unlabeled 27-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide to prevent reannealing of the unwound DNA strand, and the indicated concentrations of UL5/52 proteins, UL8 protein, ICP8, and E-SSB. In this and subsequent assays, E-SSB was added to achieve the indicated protein/nucleotide ratios assuming a site size of 35 nucleotides/tetramer of protein (Lohman and Ferrari, 21Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated by the addition of 3 µl of 100 m EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% SDS, 40% glycerol, and 0.5% bromphenol blue. The reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis through nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, and DNA unwinding was measured as described previously (Boehmer et al., 7Boehmer P.E. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1220-1225Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi was coupled to the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ and was measured by a decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm as a function of time (Boehmer and Emmerson, 4Boehmer P.E. Emmerson P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4981-4987Google Scholar). Reactions (75 µl) were performed at 37°C in 20 m HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.6, 1 m dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 3.5 m MgCl2 containing 1 m ATP, 200 µ NADH, 1.5 m phosphoenolpyruvate, 3 units each of lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, 100 n (molecules) oligodeoxyribonucleotide PB-10 as cofactor, 25 n UL5/52 proteins, and the indicated concentrations of UL8 protein, ICP8, and E-SSB. The data were collected with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2S spectrophotometer using PECSS software Version 4.2 to calculate rates of ATP hydrolysis. Primase activity was coupled to the incorporation of [32P]dATP by Sequenase. Reactions (20 µl) were performed at 30°C in 20 m EPPS/NaOH, pH 8.3, 1 m dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 6.5 m MgCl2 containing 1 m each ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP, 40 µ each dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 20 µ [32P]dATP (∼3500 µCi/µmol), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 unit of Sequenase, 1.43 n (molecules) φX174 virion DNA as template, and the indicated concentrations of UL5/52 proteins, UL8 protein, ICP8, and E-SSB. After 60 min, the reaction mixtures were spotted onto individual discs of DE81 paper (Whatman), followed by three 10-min washes in 0.5 sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and one wash in 95% ethanol. The DE81 paper discs were dried, and their radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Fig. 2 shows the ability of the UL5/52 proteins to utilize the Y-shaped partial DNA duplex molecule as a substrate for helicase action. High concentrations of UL5/52 proteins (>250 n) were required to unwind >50% of the DNA substrate. In contrast to the DNA primase activity (Crute and Lehman, 12Crute J.J. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4484-4488Google Scholar), the DNA helicase activity of the UL5/52 proteins was observed to be most active at pH 7.0-7.5, with virtually undetectable levels of activity at pH 8.0-8.6 (data not shown). Fig. 3 shows the effect of ICP8 on the helicase activity of the UL5/52 proteins. The data indicate that concentrations of ICP8 in excess of those of the UL5/52 proteins (>150 n) could stimulate the helicase activity of the UL5/52 proteins up to 3-fold (Fig. 3A). There was no significant DNA unwinding activity in the presence of ICP8 alone. Fig. 3B shows the stimulatory effect of ICP8 on the kinetics of DNA unwinding by the UL5/52 proteins. Fig. 4 shows the effect of UL8 protein on the helicase activity of the UL5/52 proteins in the absence or presence of equimolar (300 n) or excess (450 n) ICP8. Where indicated, UL8 protein was present at a 3-fold molar excess over the UL5/52 proteins. This ratio had previously been employed by Tenney et al. (34Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar) to examine the effect of UL8 protein on the primase activity of the UL5/52 proteins. The addition of this level of UL8 protein had no significant effect on the helicase activity of the UL5/52 proteins (Fig. 4). Further titration of UL8 protein showed no effect on DNA unwinding even when present at a 6-fold molar excess over UL5/52 proteins (data not shown). The addition of UL8 protein to reactions containing UL5/52 proteins and ICP8 markedly increased the level of stimulation of helicase activity observed with ICP8 alone (Fig. 4). While ICP8 concentrations of 300 and 450 n increased DNA unwinding 1.6- and 3.6-fold, respectively, the presence of UL8 protein boosted this stimulation to 3.1- and 8.6-fold, respectively. Increasing the ratio of UL8 protein to UL5/52 proteins did not significantly modulate the stimulatory effect observed in the presence of ICP8 (data not shown). Fig. 5 shows the synergistic effect of ICP8 and UL8 protein on the kinetics of DNA unwinding by the UL5/52 proteins. Fig. 6 shows that heterologous E. coli SSB could not substitute for ICP8 in this synergistic response. The addition of UL8 protein to reactions containing 300 n ICP8 stimulated DNA unwinding by the UL5/52 proteins from 2.3- to 5.6-fold. In contrast, equimolar concentrations of E-SSB led to inhibition of DNA unwinding by the UL5/52 proteins, both in the absence and presence of UL8 protein. The additive effect of ICP8 and UL8 protein on the helicase activity of the UL5/52 proteins was also observed using a DNA substrate in which a 3′-tailed oligodeoxyribonucleotide was annealed to single-strand M13 DNA (data not shown). The results show representative data that were reproducibly observed in three independent experiments. The dependence of helicase action on ATP hydrolysis led us to examine the effects of ICP8, E-SSB, and UL8 protein on the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the UL5/52 proteins. Under the conditions used in this study, DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis by the UL5/52 proteins proceeded with linear kinetics (Fig. 7). When included, UL8 protein was present at a 3-fold molar excess over the UL5/52 proteins. Fig. 8 shows the effects of ICP8, E-SSB, and UL8 protein on the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the UL5/52 proteins. There was no significant effect on the rate of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of UL8 protein. In contrast, ICP8 or E-SSB caused significant inhibition, depending on the protein/nucleotide ratio. An ICP8/nucleotide ratio of 1:7.5, which is in excess of the concentration required to coat the DNA template, reduced the rate of ATP hydrolysis to 36%. At an ICP8/nucleotide ratio of 1:15, the rate of ATP hydrolysis was reduced to 75%. Similarly, a reduction in the rate of ATP hydrolysis was observed at E-SSB concentrations that were in excess or sufficient to coat the DNA template. Thus, E-SSB/nucleotide ratios of 1:17.5 and 1:35 reduced the rate of ATP hydrolysis to 26 and 41%, respectively. The addition of UL8 protein to reactions containing ICP8 resulted in partial or complete restoration of the rate of ATP hydrolysis, depending on the concentration of ICP8. The addition of UL8 protein at an ICP8/nucleotide ratio of 1:7.5 increased the rate of ATP hydrolysis to 51%. Complete (95%) restoration of the rate of ATP hydrolysis was observed in the presence of UL8 protein at an ICP8/nucleotide ratio of 1:15. In contrast, the addition of UL8 protein to reactions containing E-SSB did not increase the rate of ATP hydrolysis. The ability of UL8 protein to increase the rate of ATP hydrolysis in reactions inhibited by the addition of ICP8, but not in those with E-SSB, was also observed at lower protein/nucleotide ratios (data not shown). These effects were observed in several independent experiments. In this study, the primase activity of the UL5/52 proteins was measured using a coupled assay in which RNA primers were extended by Sequenase DNA polymerase using single-strand φX174 DNA as template. To determine the effects of ICP8, E-SSB, and UL8 protein on primase activity, it was imperative to exclude any secondary effects of these proteins on Sequenase activity. Table II shows that UL8 protein had no significant effect on the DNA polymerase activity of Sequenase using single-strand φX174 DNA primed with random hexamer oligodeoxyribonucleotides. In contrast, the addition of ICP8 or E-SSB reduced DNA synthesis to 53 and 75% of the normal level, respectively. Similar results were obtained when using singly primed M13 DNA as template instead of random-primed φX174 DNA (data not shown). The concentrations of ICP8 and E-SSB used were in excess of those required to coat the DNA template, representing protein/nucleotide ratios of 1:15 and 1:17.5, respectively, and were the highest concentrations used in the primase assays. The magnitudes of the effects of ICP8 and E-SSB on Sequenase activity cannot account for their strong inhibition of UL5/52 primase-dependent DNA synthesis (see Fig. 9, Fig. 10). Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that the observed effects of ICP8, E-SSB, and UL8 protein are due to modulation of primase activity and not of Sequenase activity.TABLE II.Effects of ICP8, E-SSB, and UL8 protein on DNA synthesis by SequenaseAdditiondNMP incorporatedActivityaNormalized with respect to the reaction with Sequenase only.pmol%None166.9 ± 2.7100ICP888.0 ± 0.153E-SSB124.6 ± 0.175UL8 protein179.0 ± 1.7107a Normalized with respect to the reaction with Sequenase only.

Where indicated, UL8 protein was present at a 3-fold molar excess over the UL5/52 proteins. Consistent with the observations of Tenney et al. (34Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar), a 3-fold molar excess of UL8 protein could stimulate the primase activity of the core enzyme up to 3-fold (see Fig. 10). Fig. 9 shows that while UL8 protein alone could stimulate primase activity by a factor of 1.3, ICP8 or E-SSB caused significant inhibition, depending on the protein/nucleotide ratio. An ICP8/nucleotide ratio of 1:15, which is sufficient to coat the DNA template, resulted in almost complete inhibition, with 7% residual activity. In contrast, ICP8/nucleotide ratios of 1:30 and 1:60 resulted in much lower levels of inhibition, with 56 and 78% residual activity, respectively. Virtually complete inhibition of primase activity was observed at E-SSB concentrations that were in excess or sufficient to coat the DNA template. Thus, E-SSB/nucleotide ratios of 1:17.5 and 1:35 resulted in 4 and 7% residual activity, respectively. The inhibitory effect of E-SSB was less severe at a ratio of 1:70, with 27% residual activity. The addition of UL8 protein to reactions containing ICP8 resulted in a partial or complete reversal of the inhibition, depending on the concentration of ICP8. At ICP8/nucleotide ratios of 1:15 and 1:30, primase activity was increased to 24 and 74%, respectively. The addition of UL8 protein to reactions containing an ICP8/nucleotide ratio of 1:60 led to complete (98.5%) restoration of primase activity. In contrast, the addition of UL8 protein to reactions containing E-SSB did not restore primase activity. The stimulatory effect of UL8 protein on the UL5/52 primase and the partial UL8 protein-dependent rescue from inhibition by ICP8, present at a protein/nucleotide ratio of 1:15, were observed at all concentrations of UL5/52 proteins examined (Fig. 10). Titration of the molar ratio of UL8 protein to UL5/52 proteins from 0.5 to 15:1 did not enhance the rescue from inhibition by ICP8 (data not shown). We have examined the effect of UL8 protein on the utilization of SSB-covered DNA templates by the UL5/52 DNA helicase-primase core enzyme. In the absence of HSV-1 SSB, ICP8, or E-SSB, UL8 protein had no significant effects on the DNA helicase or DNA-dependent ATPase activities of the UL5/52 proteins. These observations are consistent with data from other laboratories (Calder and Stow, 9Calder J.M. Stow N.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3573-3578Google Scholar; Dodson and Lehman, 14Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1105-1109Google Scholar). In addition, as previously reported by Tenney et al. (34Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar), UL8 protein could stimulate the primase activity of the UL5/52 proteins ∼3-fold. In the absence of UL8 protein, ICP8 stimulated the DNA helicase activity of the UL5/52 proteins ∼3-fold. This observation is not surprising since SSBs frequently stimulate DNA unwinding (Kornberg and Baker, 18Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar; Lohman and Bjornson, 22Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of ICP8 was specific since heterologous E-SSB could not substitute for ICP8, suggesting that ICP8 is not merely stabilizing unwound regions of DNA. Consequently, the ability of ICP8 to stimulate the DNA helicase activity of the UL5/52 proteins is indicative of a specific physical interaction between these proteins. Consistent with our finding, Crute and Lehman (12Crute J.J. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4484-4488Google Scholar) had previously reported the specific requirement for ICP8 in the unwinding of nicked plasmids by the HSV-1 DNA helicase-primase holoenzyme. The primase and DNA-dependent ATPase activities of the UL5/52 core enzyme were strongly inhibited by ICP8 or E-SSB in a manner that varied with the SSB/nucleotide ratio. This observation may be rationalized by assuming that SSBs prevent access of the UL5/52 proteins to the DNA template. The addition of UL8 protein to reactions containing ICP8 and the UL5/52 core enzyme led to further stimulation of DNA unwinding and to reversal of inhibition of the primase and DNA-dependent ATPase activities. These effects were specific for ICP8-covered DNA templates since UL8 protein failed to stimulate reactions containing E-SSB. The DNA helicase-primase holoenzyme purified from HSV-1-infected cells consists of a 1:1:1 complex of the UL5, UL8, and UL52 subunits (Crute and Lehman, 12Crute J.J. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4484-4488Google Scholar). However, it is unclear what the relative ratios of these proteins are in vivo. The only data regarding this issue are that the UL8 transcript (Baradaran et al., 1Baradaran K. Dabrowski C.E. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4251-4261Google Scholar) and protein (Olivo et al., 27Olivo P.D. Nelson N.J. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 196-204Google Scholar), like those for the UL5 and UL52 genes, are of relatively low abundance. In our experiments, UL8 protein was added to the core enzyme to reconstitute the heterotrimeric holoenzyme. Tenney et al. (34Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Micheletti P.A. Bifano M. Hamatake R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5030-5035Google Scholar) reported that optimal in vitro reconstitution of the holoenzyme was achieved at a molar ratio of UL8 protein to UL5/52 proteins of 3:1. Accordingly, in our experiments, UL8 protein was present at a 3-fold molar excess over the UL5/52 proteins. In vivo, we envisage that the UL5/8/52 heterotrimer interaction with ICP8-covered DNA templates would not require an excess of UL8 protein. We propose that UL8 protein functions in a manner analogous to the bacteriophage T4 gene 59 protein and the E. coli DnaC protein. The T4 gene 59 protein has been reported to interact with T4 SSB (gene 32 protein)-coated single-strand DNA, and the DNA helicase component (gene 41 protein) of the T4 DNA helicase-primase (gene 41/61 proteins) (Barry and Alberts, 2Barry J. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (a): 33049-33062Google Scholar, 3Barry J. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (b): 33063-33068Google Scholar; Morrical et al., 25Morrical S.W. Hempstead K. Morrical M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33069-33081Google Scholar; Yonesaki, 39Yonesaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1284-1289Google Scholar). Consequently, its proposed role is to facilitate loading of the T4 DNA helicase-primase onto DNA templates coated with gene 32 protein to initiate lagging-strand DNA synthesis. The situation during E. coli replication is more complex (reviewed by Kornberg and Baker (18Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar)). In this system, the DnaC protein loads the DnaB helicase, and subsequently the DnaG primase, onto E-SSB-coated DNA templates, either in reactions that require DnaA protein and a DnaA protein recognition site or in combination with the primosome proteins PriA, PriB, and PriC and a primosome assembly site. Based on the ability of UL8 protein to mediate a functional interaction between ICP8 and the UL5/52 core enzyme, we hypothesize that there may be a direct interaction between these proteins. In the physiological state, during DNA replication, this interaction would optimize the utilization of ICP8-covered DNA templates. Our assumption of the existence of protein-protein interactions between the subunits of the HSV-1 DNA helicase-primase and ICP8 is supported by the finding that anti-ICP8 rabbit serum can immunoprecipitate a protein complex that contains the HSV-1 DNA helicase-primase holoenzyme, the heterodimeric DNA polymerase, and ICP8 (Skaliter and Lehman, 32Skaliter R. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10665-10669Google Scholar). We are grateful to M.-J. Pillaire for the construction of the Y-shaped DNA helicase substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2090143800,"One key problem in understanding the biosynthesis of collagens remains the assembly of the three α-chains. How and when are the different gene products selected, aligned, and folded into a triple helix? As the spatial arrangement during biosynthesis might be important, we concentrated on whether the rough endoplasmic reticular membrane is involved in this process. Microsomes were prepared from biosynthetically labeled chick tendon fibroblasts. Vesicles were spread as a monomolecular film which was then transferred over several compartments of a filmbalance containing fresh subphase. Fluorograms of the surface film showed that the monolayer contains procollagen chains. When the monolayer was transferred onto a chymotrypsin/trypsin-containing subphase, the gel bands of the proα-chains were shifted into the position of mature α-chains, indicating that only the propeptides were digested and the collagenous regions were protected due to triple helix formation. Our results suggest that newly synthesized proα-chains can associate as trimers and fold into a triple helical conformation while they are still associated with the membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. These processes also occur when interchain disulfide linkage is inhibited, indicating that chain selection and registration is not dependent on formation of covalent bonds among the carboxyl propeptides.

These processes also occur when interchain disulfide linkage is inhibited, indicating that chain selection and registration is not dependent on formation of covalent bonds among the carboxyl propeptides. Collagens are the major structural components of the extracellular matrix (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Kadler K. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 491-619Google Scholar, and references therein). The polypeptide chains containing a varying number of repeating Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeating units with proline commonly found in the Xaa and hydroxyproline frequently located in the Yaa position assemble into triple helices due to the glycine residues in each third position which fit into the center of the helix. The most common of the more than 19 different types of collagens is collagen I which is normally composed of two α1- and one α2-chains (2Ramachandran G.N. Reddi A.H. Biochemistry of Collagen. Plenum Press, New York1976Google Scholar). It is found in most connective tissues, except some cartilages and basement membranes. Trimeric collagen type I molecules assemble into fibrils by head-to-tail arrangement and laterally staggered alignment. The current view of the intracellular steps of collagen biosynthesis (for a review see, e.g. Ref. 3Olson B.R. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of the Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Press, New York1991: 177-220Google Scholar) suggests that translation of the pre-procollagen mRNA starts on nonmembrane bound ribosomes. After the signal peptide forms an intermediate complex with a signal recognition particle, it associates with the ER. 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumNEMN-ethylmaleimidePMSFphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoridePOPC1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl—α-sn-3-glycero-phosphatidylcholine. Once in the ER, the nascent chains undergo extensive cotranslational modifications (4Brownell A.G. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7137-7143Google Scholar), especially hydroxylation of specific peptidyl lysine and proline residues, which is followed by glycosylation of certain hydroxylysyl residues (5Bornstein P. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 3082-3093Google Scholar, 6Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2572-2574Google Scholar). Assembly of the proα-chains into procollagen trimers is initiated by the folding of the C-propeptides of the individual chains and formation of intrachain disulfide bonds, association of the C-propeptides followed by interchain disulfide bond formation (7Byers P.H. Click E.M. Harper E. Bornstein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3009-3013Google Scholar, 8Lukens L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3530-3538Google Scholar), nucleation of the Col1 domain and propagation of the triple helix in a zipper-like action from the COOH to NH2 terminus (9Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 605-613Google Scholar, 10Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Google Scholar, 11Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Google Scholar). The correct sets of three carboxyl propeptides of procollagen I and procollagen III are also formed when triple helix formation is prevented by inhibition of proline hydroxylation (12Bächinger H.P. Fessler L.I. Timpl R. Fessler J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13193-13199Google Scholar, 13Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7637-7646Google Scholar, 14Fessler L.I. Timpl R. Fessler J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2531-2537Google Scholar). The carboxyl propeptides are able to fold separately, followed by recognition and assembly to the trimeric complex. The telopeptide region between the carboxyl propeptides and the start of the collagen helix region are essential for trimer formation in vitro (15Doege K.J. Fessler J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8924-8935Google Scholar). Helix formation is interrupted by the random occurrence of cis peptide bonds which are converted into the trans configuration by peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase in vitro (16Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17144-17148Google Scholar, 17Davis J.M. Boswell B.A. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8956-8962Google Scholar) and probably also in vivo (18Steinmann B. Bruckner P. Superti-Furga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1299-1303Google Scholar, 19Bächinger H.P. Morris N.P. Davis J.M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 45: 152-162Google Scholar). The amino-terminal propeptides then associate and form the short stretch of triple helix within these peptides. endoplasmic reticulum N-ethylmaleimide phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl—α-sn-3-glycero-phosphatidylcholine. An open question in the biosynthetic pathway remains of how and when the different gene products are selected, aligned, and subsequently folded into a triple helix. As the spatial arrangement during biosynthesis is perhaps of relevance, we tried to determine whether the rough ER membrane is involved in chain recognition and association of the three proα-chains. As the maximum rate of a reaction depends on the encounter probabilities of the components, it would be advantageous if at least the initial steps of collagen folding would occur while the single chains are still associated with the internal surface of the lumen of the ER. A reduction of dimensionality has been proposed to be of general advantage for multimolecular diffusion-controlled processes, especially at low concentrations (20Adam G. Delbrück M. Rich A. Davidson N. Structural Chemistry and Molecular Biology. Freeman, San Francisco1968: 198Google Scholar). Based on their analysis of the folding of the carboxyl-terminal propeptide, such a mechanism has been pointed out by Doege and Fessler (15Doege K.J. Fessler J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8924-8935Google Scholar) and is supported by the finding that the components of a triple helical molecule are made in close proximity (21Veis A. Leibovich S.J. Evans J. Kirk T.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3693-3697Google Scholar). We have approached this problem by spreading rough ER-derived vesicles containing biosynthetically labeled procollagen chains as monolayers at the air/water interface. After transferring the monolayer onto fresh subphase we found that procollagen chains were co-transported with the membrane. Testing for the structural arrangement of the polypeptide chains revealed that in this state procollagen is already folded into their triple helical structure. Therefore we propose that trimerization occurs when the single proα-chains are still attached directly or indirectly to the ER membrane. If not otherwise indicated, all chemicals were from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Collagenase (Worthington; CLSPA grade) was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated in 50 m Tris-HCl, 5 m CaCl2, pH 7.6 (22Peterkofsky B. Diegelmann R. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 988-994Google Scholar). Column fractions eluting as the first peak were concentrated by ultrafiltration. On SDS gels, this material shows a single band with an apparent Mr of ∼115,000. Concentrations were determined spectroscopically assuming ϵ280 = 1.67×105−1cm−1 (23Bond M.D. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3085-3091Google Scholar). [14C]Pro, [35S]Met, and [35S]Cys were from DuPont NEN. Lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Purity and lipid composition of rough ER vesicles were checked by thin layer chromatography followed by staining in iodine vapor. Buffers were prepared with MilliQ water. For monolayer experiments, buffers were filtered (0.22 µm) and degassed. The tendon cell preparation basically followed established protocols (24Dehm P. Prockop D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 240: 358-369Google Scholar, 25Kao W.W.-Y. Berg R.A. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8391-8397Google Scholar). Briefly, leg tendon cells from ∼70 eggs of 17-day-old chick embryos were prepared by enzymic digestion. Digested tendons were filtered through lens tissue, pelleted, washed, and resuspended in the same medium with the addition of 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated in this medium for at least 30 min prior to any further treatment. For biosynthetic labeling, cells were pelleted and washed in medium lacking cysteine, proline, and methionine and resuspended. About 1×109 cells were incubated at 7×106 cells/ml at 37°C for 15 min. Labeling was carried out in volumes of 10 ml for 7.5 min or overnight. Label concentrations were 1 mCi/ml [35S]Met and [35S]Cys, and 100 µCi/ml [14C]Pro. To prevent stable triple helix formation by inhibition of hydroxylation, in some experiments cells were incubated overnight in medium containing 3 m α,α′-dipyridyl, and labeling was performed as described above. Cells were washed and resuspended twice at approximately 5 times the cell pellet volume in phosphate-buffered saline without divalent cations. To inhibit disulfide linkage, NEM was added to the buffer to a final concentration of 1 m. Cells were resuspended in homogenization buffer (5 m Hepes, pH 6.8, 250 m sucrose, 1 m PMSF, 1 m NEM, 1 m leupeptin) at 5 times the cell volume (26Stafford F.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1225-1236Google Scholar). This suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −130°C. For vesicle preparation, the cell suspension was thawed on ice and lysed in a 15-ml N2 cavitation bomb (Kontes Co., Millville, NJ) at 3.5 bar for 15 min (27Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Google Scholar). The suspension was extruded into a homogenizer vessel, adjusted to 1 m Mg2+, and then motor dounced at a very slow speed with five strokes of a Teflon pestle. The cell debris was pelleted at 1000 × g. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of the buffer that was used to wash the bomb and that had been adjusted to 1 m Mg2+. The pellet was briefly homogenized again and repelleted. To pellet mitochondria, the supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a SW40Ti Ultra-Clear tube (Beckman). The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of buffer as before but without homogenizing and repelleted. The combined supernatants were underlayed with 2 ml each of 0.44 and 1.3 sucrose in the same buffer. Rough ER microsomes were sedimented through both steps at 105,000 × g for 2 h. For stripping off the ribosomes, the microsomes were resuspended in 4 ml of 5 m Hepes, pH 6.5, 50 m KCl and pelleted at 25,500 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer, the absorbance at 260 nm was measured, and 200 m EDTA was added to a final amount of 0.3 µmol per absorbance unit per cm (28Green M. Alper B.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 368-377Google Scholar). Effective monolayer generation was usually achieved if the absorbance at this step was between 1.5 to 2.0 OD. The stripped vesicles were repelleted, stored on ice, and used immediately for monolayer experiments. Monolayer experiments were performed on a multicompartment trough (model RMC2-T, Mayer Feintechnik, Göttingen, FRG) built according to the design of Fromherz (29Fromherz P. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1975; 46: 1380-1385Google Scholar). The trough design differs from conventional Langmuir film balances in that it uses a circular geometry. The trough area is enclosed within two circles with inner and outer diameters of 130 and 250 mm, respectively, and divided into eight equal parts each covering a 45° sector by knife edged Teflon spacers. The monolayer is further enclosed between two barriers movable by a feedback-controlled motor device located in the center of the trough. One of the barriers holds a high frequency displacement transducer (Collins, Long Beach, CA, model SS-101) coupled to a spring which measures the surface tension by the Wilhelmy method. The surface pressure Π is defined as the difference of the surface tension of the pure subphase and the monolayer covered subphase relating the readily measurable change in surface pressure with the intermolecular forces of the monomolecular film (for details, see e.g. Ref. 30Gaines Jr., G.L. Insoluble Monolayers at Liquid-Gas Interfaces. Interscience Publishers, New York1966Google Scholar). Most of the experiments reported in this study were carried out in the constant surface pressure mode, i.e. any surface pressure increase due to vesicle spreading was compensated by a feedback controlled surface area increase which was monitored as an area change. To avoid leakage of the monolayer at the edges of the Teflon trough, the barriers were milled from Kel-F. The surface pressure was measured with a Wilhelmy plate made of roughened platinum/iridium (Krüss, Hamburg, FRG) with a circumference of 4 cm. The instrument was enclosed in a cabinet mounted on a massive granite block which sat on rubber feet to reduce vibrations. Surface pressure and area data were collected with a sampling rate of 2 s by a computer. After each experiment the trough, barriers, glass rod, and Wilhelmy plate were rigorously cleaned with detergent (RBS 35; Pierce), ethanol, and water. At the beginning of each experiment, the absence of surface active components was checked by compressing the full surface area of the subphase buffer to a minimum area of 15 cm2, which results in a surface pressure increase of less than 1 mN/m. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20-23°C). Lipids were dissolved in hexane (c = 1 mg/ml) and 5 µl were spread to an area of 100 cm2. After allowing the solvent to evaporate, the monolayer was slowly compressed (∼20 cm2/min) to the desired surface pressure which was held constant for the rest of the experiment. The rough ER vesicle pellet (see above) was resuspended in 10-15 µl of subphase buffer by gentle vortexing for ∼30 s. The vesicle spreading technique is reminiscent of the procedure described by Trurnit (31Trurnit H.J. J. Colloid Sci. 1960; 15: 1-13Google Scholar) (see also Verger and Pattus (32Verger R. Pattus F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1976; 16: 285-291Google Scholar)). The vesicle suspension was applied to a wet glass rod (3 mm in diameter) in 2-µl droplets. The glass rod was washed with 20-50 µl of subphase buffer and submerged into the subphase. The monolayer was incubated on the initial subphase for 90-120 min after which it was transferred onto the same buffer (control) or a buffer containing proteases (see below) where it was incubated for 120 min. Transfer was performed by switching off the constant surface pressure feedback control and moving the monolayer by simultaneous displacement of the two barriers in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction. Finally, the monolayer was transferred onto fresh buffer without enzymes and recovered by aspiration into tubes resulting in a volume of 2-3 ml. Completeness of aspiration of the monolayer was ascertained by the decay of the surface pressure to zero at minimal area. In the case of protease experiments, these tubes contained 1-ml solutions of either 1 m EDTA (to inhibit collagenase), 1 m PMSF (to inhibit trypsin and chymotrypsin), or 1 ammonium bicarbonate (to inhibit pepsin). The complete initial spreading subphase as well as the enzyme-containing subphases were collected directly into lyophilizing flasks. All solutions were frozen to −130°C and repeatedly lyophilized. The resulting material was analyzed by fluorography. Subphase buffers were 0.2 ammonium acetate, 0.1 m CaCl2, pH 6.8, except for experiments involving pepsin when 0.1 acetic acid, pH 2.7, was used. Enzymes were dissolved in the subphase buffer directly before use to concentrations of 5 µg/ml collagenase, 100 µg/ml chymotrypsin/10 µg/ml trypsin, or 5 µg/ml pepsin. Gel electrophoresis was performed using 5-20% polyacrylamide gradient gels (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Samples were applied either unreduced or reduced with 20 m dithiothreitol. For fluorography, gels were fixed and soaked in Amplify (Amersham Corp.) for 20 min. Dryed gels were incubated on preflashed Biomax MR film (Kodak) for 1-50 days at −80°C. Ultrathin sections of rough ER vesicles before and after stripping off the ribosomes were analyzed by electron microscopy. Vesicles were washed and resuspended in 0.1 sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and prepared for thin sectioning as described previously (34Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 29-52Google Scholar). Vesicle-derived monolayers were analyzed by negative stain electron microscopy. 600 mesh carbon-coated grids were used without glow-discharge and thus were rather hydrophobic. They were carefully placed on different monolayer areas for 10-60 s and picked up without immersing them into the subphase. Grids were stained for 1 min with 2% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid. To obtain sufficient vesicle material containing procollagen type I chains for use in monolayer experiments, we established a preparation protocol by combining various techniques described (see “Materials and Methods”) (Fig. 1). Fibroblasts are grown from tendons of 17-day chick embryos. For most experiments cells are labeled with radioactive proline, cysteine, and methionine for 7.5 min. Based on pulse-chase experiments, this is about the time required for the synthesis of a complete proα-chain (35Bruckner P. Eikenberry E.F. Prockop D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 607-613Google Scholar, 36Fessler L.I. Morris N.P. Fessler J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4905-4909Google Scholar). To diminish the formation of interchain disulfide linkage during the following preparation steps and during monolayer experiments, cells were briefly treated with 1 m NEM. After washing, the cells were lysed in an N2 cavitation bomb. This step was essential as former homogenization attempts employing a Potter-Elvehjen homogenizer used in the preparation of rough ER vesicles from other tissues resulted in low yields. This might be due to the extensive cytoskeleton network present in this tissue. After removing cell debris and mitochondria, rough ER vesicles were collected by sucrose density centrifugation and stripped off the ribosomes by EDTA treatment. Vesicles were analyzed for their lipid composition by thin layer chromatography. Although this method does not allow for precise quantification, the majority of lipids migrate in the position of phosphatidylcholines both before and after stripping off the ribosomes as judged from the spot intensity after incubation in iodine vapor. Furthermore, significant amounts are found in positions corresponding to (in the order of spot intensity) phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and sphingomyelin. This composition is in agreement with that reported for rough ER membranes prepared from different sources (37White D.A. Ansell G.B. Hawthorne J.N. Dawson R.M.C. Form and Function of Phospholipids. Elsevier Scientific, Amsterdam1973: 441Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of vesicles after thin sectioning (Fig. 2) revealed that the EDTA treatment effectively removed the ribosomes. Vesicles appeared unilamellar with a mean diameter of 350 nm. All monolayer experiments were carried out using volatile subphase buffers which allowed an analysis of the distribution of labeled procollagen chains by SDS-gel electrophoresis and subsequent fluorography. 100 µ CaCl2 was added which corresponds to about the concentration of free calcium in the ER lumen at rest (38Hofer A.M. Schlue W.-R. Curci S. Machem T.E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 788-798Google Scholar). For many of the proteins investigated by monolayer techniques it was found that they undergo surface denaturation when spread at low surface pressures (32Verger R. Pattus F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1976; 16: 285-291Google Scholar, 39Schürholz T. Schindler H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 20: 71-78Google Scholar). For several membrane proteins denaturation can be effectively prevented when the film is generated and held at surface pressures greater than 15 mN/m (39Schürholz T. Schindler H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 20: 71-78Google Scholar). Therefore we spread our vesicles against the pressure generated by a preformed lipid monolayer. POPC was chosen as a lipid as it was shown that phosphatidylcholine does not specifically interact with procollagen (40Choglay A.A. Purdom I.F. Hulmes D.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6107-6114Google Scholar). POPC monolayers are well characterized and are in a liquid expanded state with no phase transition in the 1-45 mN/m range at room temperature (41Smaby J.M. Brockman H.L. Biophys. J. 1985; 48: 701-708Google Scholar). In order to determine the limiting surface pressure above which no further vesicle spreading can be expected, we spread vesicles at constant area conditions against POPC monolayers of different starting surface pressures Πi (Fig. 3A). A quasiconstant final surface pressure Πf was reached after 90-120 min. In a first approximation, the surface pressure difference ΔΠ = Πf−Πi is nearly inversely proportional to Πi. Extrapolation to ΔΠ = 0 reveals a limiting pressure of ∼30 mN/m independent of the initial surface pressures in the 5 to 20 mN/m range. The linear relationship of ΔΠ versus Πi indicates that no significant unfolding of polypeptide chains occurs at low Πi which would result in unproportionally higher values of ΔΠ. The processes involved in the generation of monolayers from bilayer vesicles are only partially understood (39Schürholz T. Schindler H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 20: 71-78Google Scholar, 42Schindler H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 555: 316-336Google Scholar). Interestingly, our limiting surface pressure is within the range of 25-35 mN/m which is frequently thought of as an equivalence surface pressure for the comparison of mono- and bilayer data (42Schindler H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 555: 316-336Google Scholar, 43Demel R.G. Geurts van Kessel W.S.M. Zwaal R.F.A. Roelofsen B. Van Deenen L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 406: 97-107Google Scholar, 44Chapman D. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Goni F.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 67-70Google Scholar). When spread against a preformed POPC monolayer held at a constant surface pressure of 20 mN/m, the area increase is proportional to the amount of vesicles applied (Fig. 3B). This indicates that there is no noticeable interaction of the vesicle material with POPC. Spreading efficiency, however, varied crucially with the age of vesicle. When stored overnight either at 4°C or after freezing and thawing, less than half of the area increase could be observed. To analyze the structure of the monolayer, we spread vesicles at a constant surface pressure of 20 mN/m and waited for 1.5 h up to no further substantial area increase could be observed (Fig. 4a). Then we transferred the monolayer, enclosed between two barriers, over several trough compartments onto fresh subphase, where it was incubated for 2 h. Then the monolayer was transported again onto fresh subphase. Monolayer material from the spreading subphase taken just before transportation and after incubation on the fresh subphase was analyzed by negative stain electron microscopy. After spreading was complete, only a few vesicles could be visualized (Fig. 5A). After transfer, the monolayer appeared completely homogeneous (Fig. 5B). This indicates that any vesicles which have not integrated into the monolayer were effectively removed during transportation. In some areas, in which the monolayer appears broken, meshwork-like structures appear which may correspond to assembled procollagen molecules (Fig. 5C). Our observation that only few unspread vesicles could be found after monolayer transfer contrasts to other studies in which more sophisticated techniques for the removal of unspread vesicles were used (39Schürholz T. Schindler H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 20: 71-78Google Scholar). This may be due to the difference in the spreading technique and the considerably longer time allowed for equilibration.Fig. 5Negative stain electron micrographs of monolayers derived from rough ER vesicles. The monolayer was picked up from the spreading subphase (A) or after transport onto fresh subphase (B). In the latter case, some areas show a fibrillar meshwork underneath the monolayer (C) (bar, 100 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test whether radioactively labeled proteins adhere to the monolayer, we performed the same kind of experiment (Fig. 4a), but collected the final monolayer as well as the spreading subphase and analyzed it by fluorography (Fig. 6). The most prominent bands observed in the vesicle preparation migrate in the position of α1- and α2-procollagen I chains under both reducing and nonreducing conditions indicating that the interchain disulfide bridges within the carboxyl propeptide have not been formed in most of the material. Many less sharp bands appear below these which in part might correspond to not fully synthesized procollagen chains. The monolayer material exhibits essentially the same pattern, but some lower molecular weight proteins are missing, indicating that these proteins dissolve into the subphase. The spreading subphase contains a low amount of protein including full length procollagen chains. When the total amount of labeled protein from the monolayer and subphase material is compared with the amount of vesicles used for spreading by scintillation counting, the recovery rates turn out to be in the range of 20-40%. Most of the losses probably are due to protein adsorption to the surfaces of instruments involved in the experiments. Despite these limitations, our fluorograms show that a substantial amount of procollagen chains adheres to the transported monolayer. To investigate the folding state of the monolayer-associated collagen chains, we incubated the film on a subphase containing a 9:1 mixture of chymotrypsin/trypsin. Triple helical-folded collagen has been shown to be resistant to cleavage by this enzyme mixture, whereas in its unfolded state it is readily digested (45Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Google Scholar). During the incubation on the protease containing subphase, the monolayer area slightly increases due to the high protein concentration (Fig. 4b). Fluorograms of the digested monolayer show an increased electrophoretic mobility and the most distinct bands run in the position of mature collagen type I (Fig. 6). Analogous experiments performed on a 0.1 acetic acid subphase using pepsin as protease show essentially the same results (data not shown). This indicates that the procollagen chains attached to the monolayer are fully folded. However, this might not reflect the folding state within the rough ER as triple helix formation could have occurred during vesicle preparation especially upon lowering the temperature. A large amount of labeled material runs in positions of lower molecular mass and is found both attached to the monolayer as well as in the enzyme-containing subphase. To confirm that the gel bands indeed correspond to collagen, we incubated the monolayer on a subphase containing collagenase (Fig. 4c). Fluorograms of the digested monolayer show a continuum of labeled material running below the position of collagen and procollagen chains, whereas the collagenase-containing subphase shows dist"

In addition, the pronounced effects of introducing three negative charges support the conclusion that the two regions function in a concerted manner. Extracytoplasmic proteins in Escherichia coli often require a signal peptide to direct proper localization. As a group, signal peptides display similar physical properties, including a short positively charged amino terminus, a highly hydrophobic core region, and a more polar carboxyl terminus, which are potentially important for their role in secretion (for a review, see Izard and Kendall (12Izard J.W. Kendall D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)). The importance of the central hydrophobic region has been demonstrated extensively by mutational analyses that test the limits of the hydrophobic requirement (for a review, see Izard and Kendall (12Izard J.W. Kendall D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)). The helical potential, which has been both predicted (Austen, 3Austen B.M. FEBS Lett. 1979; 103: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and observed by physical analyses of synthetic signal peptides (Gierasch, 10Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar; Izard et al., 13Izard J.W. Doughty M.B. Kendall D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9904-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), further defines the core as a unique physical structure that might serve as a recognition element for a proteinaceous component in the export pathway. The positive charge at the amino terminus has been proposed to play a direct role in association of the signal sequence with the membrane due to an electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged phospholipids. Anionic phospholipids are essential for efficient protein transport both in vivo (de Vrije et al., 6de Vrije T. de Swart R.L. Dowhan W. Tommassen J. de Kruijff B. Nature. 1988; 334: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and in vitro (Phoenix et al., 23Phoenix D.A. Kusters R. Hikita C. Mizushima S. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17069-17073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and have been shown to promote the interaction of a precursor protein with phospholipids in a model membrane system (Keller et al., 14Keller R.C.A. ten Berge D. Nouwen N. Snel M.M.E. Tommassen J. Marsh D. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3063-3071Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The positively charged amino terminus may also be regarded as a contributing factor to the formation of a net dipole along the signal sequence (von Heijne (29von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); for a review, see Geller (9Geller B.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2093-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)). Such a dipole may facilitate inner membrane insertion complementary to the energetics of the protonmotive force, i.e. the positively charged residues remain anchored on the cytoplasmic side while the negatively charged residues are readily transported. The positive charge may also enhance a specific interaction between the signal sequence and SecA during the export process. In vitro cross-linking studies of the OmpF-Lpp fusion protein with SecA showed an interaction that was enhanced with increasing net positive charge of the signal sequence (Akita et al., 1Akita M. Sasaki S. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8164-8169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a secretion deficiency due to the presence of a negative charge at the amino terminus was partially suppressed by mutations in the prlD (SecA) gene (Puziss et al., 24Puziss J.W. Fikes J.D. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There have been some indications that the amino terminus and hydrophobic core regions may have overlapping functions. One study revealed that the defect caused by the introduction of a negative charge in the amino terminus was more pronounced when the core region was truncated (Puziss et al., 24Puziss J.W. Fikes J.D. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Bacillus subtilis, an unusually long wild-type core region was shown to tolerate the presence of negatively charged residues in the amino terminus (Chen and Nagarajan, 5Chen M. Nagarajan V. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5796-5801Crossref Google Scholar). Likewise, a core composed of nine leucine residues supports in vitro translocation of a model secretory protein with zero charge, whereas shorter hydrophobic cores require positive charge (Hikita and Mizushima, 11Hikita C. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12375-12379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have investigated the interdependence of these two regions using a systematic series of mutant signal sequences composed of at least one negatively charged residue amino-terminal to a series of simplified core regions with increasing hydrophobicity. We observe very efficient export of mutants containing a negatively charged amino terminus when the core region is sufficiently hydrophobic. However, even a highly hydrophobic signal peptide can be made less efficient if three negative charges are introduced, demonstrating the disruptive influence of excessive negative charge. Interestingly, the negatively charged signal sequence mutants still rely on the protonmotive force and functional SecA, the former suggesting that the role of the membrane potential is not exclusively electrostatic and the latter indicating that a positively charged amino terminus is not the only requirement for engaging SecA. The most efficient negatively charged mutants even demonstrate a competition for the transport pathway by preventing normal levels of secretion of coexpressed wild-type β-lactamase, yet the level of competition is lower than for the corresponding positively charged signal peptide. Our results suggest that the amino terminus and hydrophobic core of the signal peptide function in a concerted manner. E. coli strain AW1043 (Δlac galU galK Δ(leu-ara) phoA-E15 proC::Tn5) was used for mutant construction and in all transport experiments. For general propagation of bacteria and for production of mutants, cells were grown in LB medium (Miller, 19Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) containing 250 µg/ml ampicillin and 50 µg/ml kanamycin. Transport studies were conducted in MOPS 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidCCCPcarbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone. (Neidhardt et al., 20Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under no-phosphate conditions to induce alkaline phosphatase expression. 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone. All of the mutants were produced by cassette mutagenesis by using plasmids that contain unique restriction enzyme sites flanking specific regions of the wild-type and mutant alkaline phosphatase signal peptides. The construction of the WT-Afl vector, which displays an AflII site at the initial methionine of alkaline phosphatase, was described by Izard et al. (13Izard J.W. Doughty M.B. Kendall D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9904-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The AflII site was introduced into vectors containing various alkaline phosphatase signal peptide core region mutants as follows. After digestion of the WT-Afl vector with ScaI and SalI, the intervening 835-base pair DNA segment that included the AflII site was isolated and inserted into mutant vectors from which the ScaI-SalI fragment had been removed. These new vectors were then digested with AflII and SalI and subjected to gel electrophoresis to remove the DNA coding for the wild-type amino terminus of the signal peptide; synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the desired amino-terminal sequence, MEQST, were annealed and ligated with the prepared vectors. Due to interference with the SalI restriction enzyme site, the amino-terminal mutant containing three glutamic acid residues and a 10-leucine core region, 3E10L, was constructed by replacement of the entire signal peptide using the flanking AflII and BssHII sites as described by Izard et al. (13Izard J.W. Doughty M.B. Kendall D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9904-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mutant sequences were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and direct DNA sequencing (Sanger et al., 27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (51934) Google Scholar). To determine the rate of precursor processing, cells were grown to the logarithmic phase, labeled at 37°C with 40 µCi of -[35S]methionine for 40 s, and chased with 4 mg/ml nonradioactive methionine for 30 s and 10 min, after which alkaline phosphatase was immunoprecipitated (Kendall et al., 15Kendall D.A. Bock S.C. Kaiser E.T. Nature. 1986; 321: 706-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To assess the involvement of SecA, cells were treated with sodium azide essentially as described by Oliver et al. (21Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This involved incubating cells with 2 m sodium azide at 37°C for 5 min prior to a 40-s pulse with 40 µCi of -[35S]methionine and a 30-s chase with 4 mg/ml unlabeled methionine. To dissipate the protonmotive force, the procedure of Kuhn and Wickner (16Kuhn A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15914-15918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Cells were incubated at 37°C in 100 µ CCCP in dimethyl sulfoxide or in an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide alone for 1 min prior to a 2-min labeling. To determine the effect of the negatively charged alkaline phosphatase mutants on the transport of coexpressed wild-type protein in the cell, the precursor processing of wild-type β-lactamase was examined. Transport analysis involved a pulse-chase experiment as described above, followed by immunoprecipitation of the whole cell sample with antiserum to β-lactamase. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated using 7.5% 20-cm-long or 20% mini Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Laemmli, 17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204183) Google Scholar) and visualized by fluorography. For quantitation of the precursor and mature forms of alkaline phosphatase or β-lactamase, the radioactive protein was solubilized from the gel by the SOLVABLE™ protocol (DuPont NEN), followed by scintillation counting (Rusch et al., 25Rusch S.L. Chen H. Izard J.W. Kendall D.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, a systematic series of signal sequences for alkaline phosphatase was constructed to investigate the functional inter-relationship between the amino terminus and the hydrophobic core. The simplified core regions were composed of varying ratios of alanine and leucine residues, producing a range of hydrophobicities with minimal variation in amino acid content (Doud et al., 7Doud S.K. Chou M.M. Kendall D.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1251-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar; Rusch et al., 25Rusch S.L. Chen H. Izard J.W. Kendall D.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these sequences have the potential for forming uniform α-helices that may effectively produce a more hydrophobic surface (Izard et al., 13Izard J.W. Doughty M.B. Kendall D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9904-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). By substituting a glutamic acid residue for the lysine in the wild-type amino terminus of signal peptides containing select core regions, this well defined series provides a basis for examining the effect of a negative charge on the association of precursors with the transport pathway. An additional mutant was also generated in which we introduced three negatively charged residues amino-terminal to the 10-leucine core (Fig. 1). The rate of precursor processing for each negatively charged mutant was determined by pulse-chase analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, the presence of a glutamic acid residue in tandem with the wild-type core region resulted in a decrease in the amount of alkaline phosphatase processed within a 30-s chase, from 95 ± 0.2 to 67 ± 3.6%. In contrast, a similar mutant containing a highly hydrophobic core, E10L, was processed very rapidly, in spite of the negative charge at the amino terminus. To determine the degree of hydrophobicity in the core required to overcome the effect of a single negative charge, we reduced the hydrophobicity (through a series of mutants) by incrementally increasing the ratio of alanine to leucine residues from 0:10 to 6:4. Interestingly, little effect of one negative charge is observed for the simplified mutants that have a net hydrophobicity similar to (i.e. E4A6L) or above that of the wild type. It is not until the core region hydrophobicity is dropped to a level corresponding to six alanines and four leucines that substantial inhibition of precursor processing occurs; E6A4L exhibits only 17% processing in a 30-s chase in comparison to 48% in 30 s for the same mutant with the wild-type amino terminus (Doud et al., 7Doud S.K. Chou M.M. Kendall D.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1251-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the introduction of three negative charges adjacent to the 10-leucine core, 3E10L, inhibits secretion. The EWT, E6A4L, and 3E10L mutants process further during a 10-min chase, but do not achieve the extent of processing observed for the other mutants in just 30 s. Lysozyme-EDTA cell fractionation (Laforet and Kendall, 18Laforet G.A. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to confirm the correct localization of the mature form of alkaline phosphatase to the periplasm (data not shown). One question to be addressed was whether these negatively charged mutants followed the same pathway as wild-type signal peptides or if they utilized a different, perhaps less efficient, pathway. Since the amino-terminal positive charge has been suggested to play a role in SecA interaction (Puziss et al., 24Puziss J.W. Fikes J.D. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Akita et al., 1Akita M. Sasaki S. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8164-8169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used a SecA inhibitor to evaluate the extent to which our mutants still interact with this component. Sodium azide has been shown to specifically inhibit the function of the SecA-ATPase, usually resulting in precursor accumulation (Oliver et al., 21Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, the wild-type alkaline phosphatase shows a substantial decrease in precursor processing when treated with azide as compared with an untreated control. In addition, the EWT, E4A6L, and E2A8L mutants exhibit precursor accumulation as a consequence of azide treatment, indicating that the negatively charged mutants still depend on SecA. However, the extent to which azide affects each mutant diminishes as the net hydrophobicity of the core region increases, with the most hydrophobic mutant, E10L, remaining unaffected. The pattern is striking even when the differences in processing among the untreated samples are taken into account; the amounts of mature protein that are affected by azide treatment were calculated to be 73, 53, and 0% for E4A6L, E2A8L, and E10L, respectively. Comparison of the effects of azide on 2A8L (Rusch et al., 25Rusch S.L. Chen H. Izard J.W. Kendall D.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and E2A8L reveals the effect of the negative charge; whereas only 6% of the mature form of 2A8L is affected by treatment with azide, 53% of the mature form of E2A8L is affected under the same conditions. Furthermore, the processing of 3E10L is drastically reduced in the presence of azide. Protein transport has been shown to require the protonmotive force (Kuhn and Wickner, 16Kuhn A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15914-15918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may act directly on the dipole along the signal peptide to affect its bilayer orientation. Treatment of cells with an ionophore, CCCP, allowed us to evaluate the protonmotive force requirement; the results are shown in Fig. 4. The response is not dependent on the presence of amino-terminal positive charge, but rather on the overall efficiency of the signal sequence. The negatively charged mutants with less hydrophobic cores are sensitive to CCCP, indicating that they depend on the protonmotive force. Although the charge on the side chains along the length of the signal peptide now runs counter to the direction of the dipole, these peptides may retain the dipole along the peptide backbone if a helical structure is adopted. As observed for azide treatment, the degree of sensitivity varies, with the most hydrophobic sequences being least sensitive. Although the E2A8L mutant appears unaffected by 100 µ CCCP, it did show a more pronounced defect when treated with 400 µ CCCP (data not shown). Again, the E10L mutant remained unaffected even by the higher concentration of ionophore. Mutants with high affinity for the transport machinery will out compete, and thus inhibit, the secretion of other exported proteins in vivo (Rusch et al., 25Rusch S.L. Chen H. Izard J.W. Kendall D.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The transport of wild-type β-lactamase, coexpressed from the same plasmid as each alkaline phosphatase mutant, provides an indicator of whether the two proteins use the same pathway and their relative affinities for that pathway. As shown in Fig. 5, some of the negatively charged alkaline phosphatase mutants cause inhibition of β-lactamase processing, and the amount of β-lactamase precursor increases with increasing hydrophobicity of the alkaline phosphatase signal sequence. Interestingly, the E10L mutant causes somewhat less β-lactamase precursor accumulation than the 10L mutant, indicating less competition due to the presence of the negative charge, and β-lactamase is completely processed in cells harboring the less efficient mutants, EWT and 3E10L. In this study, the effect of introducing a negative charge into the amino terminus of a signal sequence was titrated by decreasing the level of hydrophobicity in the core region. Our analysis suggests that high hydrophobicity, coupled with an uninterrupted α-helical structure, in the core region can compensate for an altered amino-terminal segment and is consistent with findings using B. subtilis signal peptide mutants (Chen and Nagarajan, 5Chen M. Nagarajan V. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5796-5801Crossref Google Scholar). The results suggest that the amino terminus and core region act together as a unit; when the entire unit is less than ideal, the precursor has a lower affinity for the transport machinery, and export is inefficient. The recognition of the two regions as a unit is significant because it implies that their functions overlap. Treatment of cells with azide and CCCP demonstrated that the negatively charged mutants require both the protonmotive force and SecA for transport. These results are contrary to proposals that the amino-terminal positive charge provides an alignment with the protonmotive force or that it solely drives the interaction with SecA. Several studies using membrane proteins have indicated that the membrane electrochemical potential promotes the transfer of negative charges and inhibits the transfer of positive charges across the bacterial inner membrane (Andersson and von Heijne, 2Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar; Cao et al., 4Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of the protonmotive force might be expected to inhibit the processing of our precursors containing negatively charged amino termini because of the tendency to be inserted into the membrane in the “inverted” orientation (especially since the carboxyl terminus contains a positive charge). However, the efficient processing and localization to the periplasm in the presence of the protonmotive force and the loss of processing in its absence show that these mutants are affected in the same way as the wild type. Mutations in the prlD (SecA) gene partially suppressed the transport defect caused by a negatively charged amino terminus in the maltose-binding protein signal peptide (Puziss et al., 24Puziss J.W. Fikes J.D. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The suppression may not actually be allele-specific; alternatively, the suppression may merely reflect an increased interaction with the hydrophobic core region such that the presence of the negative charge is tolerated. This idea parallels the results of our evaluation of the negatively charged series presented here. We observe a graded response of the mutants described here to CCCP and azide treatment; those with the most hydrophobic cores and fewest negative charges were least sensitive. The diminishing influence of azide on the transport of the more hydrophobic mutants indicates that these require lower levels of SecA. One interpretation of this finding is that the most highly hydrophobic signal peptides simply do not utilize SecA. Alternatively, we propose that the diminishing sensitivity may actually reflect an increasing affinity of these signal sequences for SecA; since the inhibition of SecA by azide treatment may not be complete, signal sequences having a high affinity are successfully secreted via the few sites that remain unaffected by the azide. This is in line with our findings using other mutants (Rusch et al., 25Rusch S.L. Chen H. Izard J.W. Kendall D.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and those described by Sääf et al. (26Sääf A. Andersson H. Gafvelin G. von Heijne G. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Likewise, the impact of CCCP is consistent with the notion that sensitivity strongly depends on the number of sites that remain uninhibited and on the affinity of each mutant for these sites. A similar trend was observed for the dependence of the in vitro translocation of LamB, OmpA, and Skp on SecA and the protonmotive force (Ernst et al., 8Ernst F. Hoffschulte H.K. Thome-Kromer B. Swidersky U.E. Werner P.K. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12840-12845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That the SecA requirements for several different precursors (wild type and mutant) parallel the protonmotive force requirements (Rusch et al., 25Rusch S.L. Chen H. Izard J.W. Kendall D.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar; Ernst et al., 8Ernst F. Hoffschulte H.K. Thome-Kromer B. Swidersky U.E. Werner P.K. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12840-12845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; this study) likely points to a link between SecA and the protonmotive force (Geller, 9Geller B.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2093-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Ernst et al. (8Ernst F. Hoffschulte H.K. Thome-Kromer B. Swidersky U.E. Werner P.K. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12840-12845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the precursor-dependent level of sensitivity may reflect the kinetics of folding or aggregation of the precursors in the cytoplasm, with those that fold least readily more frequently remaining in a translocation-competent state and thus requiring the lowest levels of SecA and the protonmotive force. Our data suggest several complementary possibilities. 1) The most hydrophobic signal peptides may help retard folding of the precursor into a translocation-incompetent state (Park et al., 22Park S. Liu G. Topping T.B. Cover W.H. Randall L.L. Science. 1988; 239: 1033-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). 2) The highly hydrophobic signal peptides may remain more accessible to the secretion pathway. 3) The more hydrophobic signal peptides may possess an inherently higher affinity for the pathway. The increase in precursor accumulation of coexpressed β-lactamase in cells harboring the most highly hydrophobic signal peptides is most easily interpreted in view of the latter possibility. Here, we have shown that very hydrophobic core regions have a high affinity for the transport apparatus, yet the contribution of the positive charge at the amino terminus for less hydrophobic sequences remains evident. The positive charge in tandem with a hydrophobic core may provide a functional unit, possibly for recognition by a proteinaceous component analogous to the recognition of polypeptide sequences with a similar combination of features by the heat shock protein hsc70 (Takenaka et al., 28Takenaka I.M. Leung S.-M. McAndrew S.J. Brown J.P. Hightower L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19839-19844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The binding energy for any interacting proteins will be the sum of the energy derived from several parameters including the free energy of hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions. For the negatively charged signal peptides, maximizing the binding energy derived from the hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction could overcome an unfavorable electrostatic repulsion involving the negative charges on both the protein and the amino terminus of the signal peptide. This study highlights the importance of combining the physical features of both regions in order to provide the functional units of natural targeting sequences. We thank Judith A. Boice for the generous contribution of antiserum to β-lactamase."

While the overwhelming majority of studies indicate that the cellular response to TGF-β is mediated through these receptors, there is controversy as to the particular receptor profile(s) responsible for individual activities. To that end, two competing but not mutually exclusive models have been proposed. The basis of the first model is that all TGF-β signaling requires heteromeric complex formation between the type I and type II TGF-β receptors. There is a great deal of genetic evidence using chemically derived cell mutants in support of such a model (14Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massaguá J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Feng X.-F. Filvaroff E.H. Derynck R. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar). For instance, Wrana et al. (18Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massaguá J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar) have presented data indicating both a physical and functional association between the type I and type II TGF-β receptors. Moreover, recent publications have shown that the type II TGF-β receptor is a constitutively active kinase capable of binding ligand (19Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massaguá J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar, 20Ventura F. Doody J. Liu F. Wrana J.L. Massaguá J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5581-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Once ligand is bound, this results in the recruitment and transphosphorylation of the type I receptor, which allows propagation of the signal to downstream effectors. A fundamental tenet to this model is that the type I TGF-β receptor is unable to bind ligand alone in the absence of the type II receptor (18Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massaguá J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar, 19Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massaguá J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar). Although a great deal of evidence has been generated in support of this model, there is similarly a large amount of data at odds with the heteromeric model. For instance, chemical cross-linking analysis of many nontransformed and transformed cell types has shown TGF-β binding to type I receptors in the absence of type II receptor binding (21Brandes M.E.

Science. 1993; 260: 1335-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar); and (iv) other TGF-β family members such as OP-1 and BMP-4 are capable of binding type I receptors in the absence of type II receptor expression (34ten Dijke P.

While a large amount of data have accumulated both in support of and in argument against the previous discussed TGF-β receptor models, most of the reports are heavily dependent on the use of chemically derived epithelial cell mutants resistant to TGF-β growth inhibition, cross-linking analysis (11Laiho M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7134-7141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although these approaches have merit, the manner in which they have been used does not preclude a number of alternative interpretations (hence the controversy in the literature). To that end, we addressed this question concerning the requirement for TGF-β receptor heteromers or homomers by generating stable cell lines expressing chimeric receptors consisting of the ligand binding domain of the granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) α or β receptors (36Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 12: 3667-3676Crossref Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 37Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai K.-I. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the type I and type II TGF-β receptors. Since high affinity GM-CSF binding occurs through the formation of an α/β heterodimer (37Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai K.-I. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 38Shanafelt A.B. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Kastelein R.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4105-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we can generate cytoplasmic receptor heteromers (type I/type II) or homomers (type I/type I or type II/type II) with essentially total specificity. In addition to directly comparing the signaling capabilities of TGF-β receptor heteromers and homomers, this chimeric approach has a number of other advantages: (i) there is an absence of endogenous GM-CSF receptors which might complicate the analyses; (ii) it includes the ability to test TGF-β signaling in cell lines that have not been chemically mutated (i.e. avoids unknown mutagenic events); (iii) it is amenable to the generation of stable cell lines for examining endogenous cellular responses (i.e. is not solely dependent on transient assays); (iv) all assays are internally controlled in that one can directly compare the response seen with the chimeric receptor (i.e. activated by GM-CSF) to that of the endogenous TGF-β receptor (i.e. activated by TGF-β) in the same cell population; and (v) this approach can be used in essentially any cell system where one wishes to determine the TGF-β receptor complex mediating effects on cellular growth, differentiation, and/or cell signaling. We have initially used this system in mesenchymal AKR-2B cells previously shown to be highly responsive to TGF-β receptor activation (39Alexandrow M.G. Kawabata M. Aakre M. Moses H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3239-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 40Leof E.B. Proper J.A. Goustin A.S. Shipley G.D. DiCorleto P.E. Moses H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2453-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The data support the model initially proposed by Massaguá and colleagues (18Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massaguá J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar, 19Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massaguá J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar) in that all TGF-β receptor signaling requires heteromeric complex formation. For instance, while chimeric receptor heteromers modulate transient, endogenous, and long term growth responses similar to activating the endogenous TGF-β receptor, no signaling activity is observed in chimeric receptor combinations consisting solely of type I/type I or type II/type II TGF-β receptor homomers. Recombinant human granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor was a generous gift from DNAX Research Institute (Palo Alto, CA), and recombinant human TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 were purchased from Austral Biologicals (San Ramon, CA) or R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). No appreciable difference was observed for TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 ligands, and they are used interchangeably to document this response. The type I (ALK-5 or R4) TGF-β receptor was obtained from Dr. Kohei Miyazona (Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan), the type II TGF-β receptor cDNA was obtained from Dr. Harvey Lodish (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA), the human GM-CSF α receptor cDNA was from Dr. Tony Troutt (Immunex Research, Seattle, WA), and the common human GM-CSF β subunit was provided by Dr. Kenneth Kaushansky (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Expression plasmids pNa and pHa were from Dr. Brad Nelson at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle, WA), and the 3TP-Lux reporter plasmid was from Dr. Joan Massaguá (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). AKR-2B cells were grown in 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Summit, Ft. Collins, CO) supplemented Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following transfection with the chimeric receptor expression plasmids the transfected cells were maintained in 5% FBS/DMEM containing 100 µg/ml bioactive Geneticin (Life Technologies) and 50 µg/ml bioactive Hygromycin (Sigma). Cells were detached in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), pH 7.2, containing 40 mM EDTA and 20 mM HEPES. The cells were washed twice in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, RPMI 1640 medium, pH 7.4), and approximately 5 × 105 cells were mixed at 4°C for 2 h with rocking in 200 µl of binding buffer, 100 pM 125I-labeled recombinant human GM-CSF (DuPont NEN) with or without 25-50-fold excess unlabeled GM-CSF. Bound was separated from free by centrifugation at 4°C (12,000 × g for 2 min) through chilled 25% binding buffer with 75% horse serum (41DiPersio J. Billing P. Kaufman S. Eghtesady P. Williams R.E. Gasson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1834-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Life Technologies, Inc.). The pellets were counted in a MiniAxi 5000 series (Packard Instrument Co.) gamma counter, where specific binding routinely represented 70-90% of total binding. Parental AKR-2B cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/10 cm2 culture dish 24 h prior to transfection. Four µg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 100 µl of 2.5 M CaCl2, pH 7.4, and 500 µl of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.3, and added dropwise to 500 µl of 2 × HEBS (140 mM NaCl, 40 mM HEPES, 11 mM dextrose, 10 mM KCl, 1.4 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.2). The precipitate was then added to 10 ml of growth medium (5% FBS/DMEM) covering the cells and incubated for 6 h at 37°C. Following a 2-min 10% glycerol shock, the cultures were placed in fresh growth medium for 36 h prior to a 1:20-1:40 split into selective medium (5% FBS/DMEM, 400 µg/ml Geneticin, 150 µg/ml Hygromycin B, bioactive concentrations). Well isolated clones (2 or 3/10-cm2 plate) were subcloned with polyethylene 8-mm cylinders directly into a well of a 24-well dish (2.0 cm2) and expanded. It was not possible to use known restriction sites to generate the four chimeric receptors. For that reason the receptors were constructed using a modification of the splicing by overlap extension technique (42Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). Three polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) and four different oligonucleotides were required for each chimeric receptor. The following oligonucleotides were used, where the underlined portion denotes the indicated type I or type II TGF-β receptor, the lower case a unique restriction site plus four nucleotides, and the rest the appropriate GM-CSF α or β receptor. For αI (extracellular ligand binding domain of the GM-CSF α receptor fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the type I TGF-β receptor): 1) gatagtcgacGCTCTTCCCTTCTCTCTGACCAG; 2) gataaagcttTTACATTTTGATGCCTTCCTGTTGACTGAGT; 3) GCAATGACAGCTGCCAGCCCGTCGTCAGAACC; 4) GGTTCTGACGACGGGCTGGCAGCTGTCATTGC; for αII: 1) gatatctagaGCTCTTCCCTTCTCTCTGACCAG; 2) gataggatccCTATTTGGTAGTGTTTAGGGAGCCGTCT; 3) ATATGACTAGCAACAACCCGTCGTCAGAACC; 4) GGTTCTGACGACGGGTTGTTGCTAGTCATAT; for βI: 1) gatagtcgacATGGTGCTGGCCCAGGGGCTGCTCTCC; 2) gatagtcgacTTACATTTTGATGCCTTCCTGTTGACTGAGT; 3) GCAATGACAGCTGCCAGCGACTCGGTGTCCCA; 4) TGGGACACCGAGTCGCTGGCAGCTGTCATTGC; for βII: 1) gataggtaccATGGTGCTGGCCCAGGGGCTGCTCTCC; 2) gataggatccCTATTTGGTAGTGTTTAGGGAGCCGTCT; 3) ATATGACTAGCAACAACGACTCGGTGTCCCA; 4) TGGGACACCGAGTCGTTGTTGCTAGTCATAT. The first PCR reaction used oligos 1 and 3 with an appropriate GM-CSF receptor subunit cDNA as template, while the second used oligos 2 and 4 with either a type I or type II TGF-β receptor cDNA as template. The first reaction places a TGF-β receptor complementary sequence and an unique restriction site on the 3′ and 5′ end of the GM-CSF receptor extracellular domain, respectively. Likewise, the second places a GM-CSF receptor sequence and an unique restriction site on the 5′ and 3′ end of the TGF-β receptor transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain, respectively. The products from reactions 1 and 2 were combined in a final splicing PCR reaction using oligos 1 and 2 as primers. Each PCR reaction was performed in a 50-µl volume with 200 ng each of oligonucleotide, 2 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM dNTPs with 100 ng of template plasmid containing cDNA, and 1 unit of Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) in the initial two amplifications and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for the final third splicing by overlap extension reaction. Typically, 20-25 PCR cycles profiled as 94°C 2′, 45°C 1′, and 72°C 1.5′ with 2 min pre- and postdwells at 94°C and 72°C, respectively, were used. These reactions result in splicing the last extracellular amino acid of the GM-CSF α receptor (amino acid 320) (36Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 12: 3667-3676Crossref Scopus (518) Google Scholar) or GM-CSF β receptor (amino acid 435) (37Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai K.-I. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The splicing by overlap extension products were subcloned into PCRII (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and subsequently cloned into the mammalian expression plasmids pNa (αI and αII) and pHa (βI and β2). Chimeric cDNAs were sequenced entirely on both strands by a combination Sanger dideoxy (Sequenase version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and automated PCR-based (Applied Biosystems model 373A version 1.2.1) sequencing. PCR-induced mutations were fixed in a PCR-based cassette (43Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6735) Google Scholar) (DNA region flanked by unique restriction sites) or by direct restriction cassettes with the original cDNA as an unmutated source. All cassettes were resequenced upon ligation into final expression plasmids. One µg of the chimeric receptor plasmid in PCRII (for αII, βI, and βII) or pGEM3Z (for αI) containing cDNAs oriented 3′ of the T7 promoter were transcribed and translated in a coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). The translation products from each reaction were equally split three ways. One was left untreated while the other two were processed for immunoprecipitation prior to separation by SDS-PAGE. Conditions for immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography were as described previously (44Eblen S.T. Fautsch M.P. Burnette R.J. Snyder M. Leof E.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1994-2000PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech and used at 2 µg/ml (type I TGF-β receptor, catalog number sc398; type II TGF-β receptor, catalog number sc400; human GM-CSF α receptor, catalog number sc456; and human GM-CSF β receptor, catalog number sc457). Cells were seeded at 3 × 105 in p60 culture dishes (22 cm2), grown to confluence, washed twice and placed in serum-free MCDB 402 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) for 48 h. Cultures were placed at 37°C in fresh MCDB 402 medium alone or containing 10 ng/ml GM-CSF or TGF-β for 24 h. Fresh GM-CSF or TGF-β was then added directly (10 ng/ml) for an additional 24 h incubation, and the cultures were photographed at 20× phase contrast. Soft agar assays were performed as described previously (45Howe P.H. Bascom C.C. Cunningham M.R. Leof E.B. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6024-6031PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 104 cells were plated into 10% FBS/DMEM containing 0.4% agarose with or without growth factors over a 0.8% agarose, 10% FBS/DMEM plug in p35 culture dishes (9.6 cm2). Growth occurred over a 10-day period at 37°C, and photographs were taken at 10× bright field. The results are representative of three separate experiments, each done in triplicate. Cells were plated in 6-well dishes (9.6 cm2) at 1.5 × 105/well 24 h prior to transfection. Three µg of 3TP-Lux, 0.5 µg of CMV-β-galactosidase, and 7 µl of TransIT LT2 (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI) were combined with Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies) to a final volume of 100 µl. The solution was mixed, incubated for 10 min at 25°C, and then added to cells containing 2 ml of serum-free DMEM for 6 h. After removal of the transfection medium, cells were permitted to recover overnight in 5% FBS/DMEM and made quiescent by incubation in serum-free MCDB 402 medium for 24 h. Cultures were then stimulated in 5% FBS/DMEM for 24 h in the presence or absence of TGF-β or GM-CSF and harvested in 200 µl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined in a Berthold Lumat 9501 luminometer after normalization for transfection efficiency with β-galactosidase. Cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture dishes at 2 × 105 cells/well 24 h before treatment. The serum-containing medium was removed, and the cultures were washed with 2 ml of methionine-free DMEM and placed in 1 ml of serum-free DMEM lacking methionine but supplemented with the indicated growth factors. Following a 2 h treatment at 37°C, cells were pulsed for 2 h with 50 µCi of [35S]Met/Cys Promix/ml (Amersham Corp.) and processed by washing (1 ml) once with PBS, three times with 10 mM Tris, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 µg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), pH 8.0, twice with 2 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and once with PBS (46Carcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massaguá J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The washes solubilize all but the remaining matrix proteins, which were eluted from the plate by addition of 100 µl of 2 × Lammeli buffer containing 10%β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and exposed for autoradiography or scanned with a phosphoimager (Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst version 1.0, Hercules, CA). Cells were detached in DMEM containing 40 mM EDTA and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2. After washing with 5% FBS/DMEM and antibody buffer (PBS containing 2% FBS, 0.02% NaN3), approximately 7.5 × 105 cells were incubated in 100 µl with primary monoclonal antibody at 5 µg/ml (anti-human GM-CSF α receptor, Santa Cruz catalog number sc456; or anti-human GM-CSF β receptor, Santa Cruz catalog number sc457) for 1 h at 4°C with rocking. Cells were washed twice with antibody buffer and incubated with 1:50 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma catalog number F2012) for 45 min at 4°C with rocking. After washing twice with antibody buffer and suspension in 500 µl of PBS containing 0.5 µg of propidium iodide, cells were filtered through a 40 µM nylon mesh prior to flow analysis using a Beckton Dickinson FACS Vantage with PCLYSYS version 1.1 software. As discussed in the introduction, the receptor complex responsible for TGF-β-dependent signaling is presently unclear. As a means to address the two receptor paradigms concerning TGF-β signaling, the chimeric receptors depicted in Fig. 1A were generated (described under “Experimental Procedures”). This system takes advantage of the plasticity inherent in many plasma membrane receptors (47Chang C.P. Lazar C.S. Walsh B.J. Komuro M. Collawn J.F. Kuhn L.A. Tainer J.A. Trowbridge I.S. Farquhar M.G.

After a 15-h pulse the total amount of cell-bound GM3 corresponded to about 2% of the endogenous ganglioside content. Cells were then subjected to a 72-h chase, and the radioactive products from both ganglioside catabolism and salvage processes of catabolic fragments were measured. These data indicated that about 50% of the cell-bound ganglioside underwent metabolic processing, suggesting a ganglioside half-life of 2-3 days. [Neu5Ac-3H] formed from [Neu5Ac-3H]GM3 degradation was mostly re-cycled for the biosynthesis of gangliosides and sialoglycoproteins, only a minor part being degraded to [3H]water, which constituted only 1.6% of total metabolite linked radioactivity. [Sph-3H] from the [Sph-3H]GM3 degradation was partly re-cycled for the biosynthesis of gangliosides, neutral glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin, and partly (about 20% of the total metabolite linked radioactivity) degraded to [3H]water. In Salla fibroblasts metabolic processing of [Neu5Ac-3H]GM3 produced large amounts of free [3H]Neu5Ac, and a reduced incorporation of radioactivity into glycoconjugates (as compared to normal cells). However, the accumulation of free Neu5Ac was not accompanied by an increase of tritiated water. LacCer and Cer from [stearoyl-14C]GM3 catabolism were found to accumulate in Salla fibroblasts, an indication that the enzymes of glycosphingolipid metabolism were affected by the impairment of Neu5Ac egress from lysosomes.

https://openalex.org/W1986514098,"We report the preparation and characterization of interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) refolded from its p20 and p10 protein fragments. Refolded ICE heterodimer (p20p10) was catalytically active but unstable, and in size exclusion chromatography eluted at an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa. The mechanisms of the observed instability were pH-dependent dissociation at low enzyme concentrations, and autolytic degradation of the p10 subunit at high concentrations. Binding and subsequent removal of a high affinity peptidic inhibitor increased the apparent molecular mass to 43 kDa (by size exclusion chromatography), and significantly increased its stability and specific activity. Chemical cross-linking and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the 43-kDa size exclusion chromatography conformer revealed a 60-kDa species, which was absent in the 30-kDa conformer, suggesting that inhibitor binding caused formation of a (p20p10)2 homodimer. The observation of a reversible equilibrium between ICE (p20p10) and (p20p10)2 suggests that analogous associations, possibly between ICE and ICE homologs, can occur in vivo, resulting in novel oligomeric protease species."

Early studies that examined this interaction in vivo employed anti-phosphotyrosine antiserum or antiserum against the PDGF receptor. The recent identification of multiple isoforms of both the regulatory and the catalytic subunit of the enzyme have led us to utilize antisera against p85α and p110α to characterize the association of this particular phosphoinositide 3-kinase complex with the PDGF receptor following ligand stimulation of murine fibroblasts. Both the p85α and p110α subunits rapidly associated with the ligand-activated receptor resulting in a transient, 2-fold increase in the total pool of p110α lipid kinase activity. This association was stable for 15 min after initial stimulation. Subsequently, both subunits began to dissociate from the receptor with similar kinetics. By 60 min this process was complete, demonstrating that p85α and p110α both associate with the receptor and dissociate from the receptor as a dimeric complex. At this time, marked PDGF receptor down-regulation was observed. Immunoprecipitation from metabolically labeled cells revealed that p85α is constitutively phosphorylated on serine residues in quiescent cultures. Upon PDGF stimulation, this phosphorylation upon serine residues was maintained in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation of this subunit. No phosphorylation of the p110α subunit was detected in either quiescent or PDGF-stimulated cells. Quantitation of Western blot analysis demonstrated that only 5% of the total pool of p85α associated with the PDGF receptor upon ligand stimulation. The 2-fold increase in the lipid kinase activity measured in immunoprecipitates using either anti-p85α or anti-p110α antiserum therefore reflects a far greater increase in the specific activity of the enzyme upon its association with the PDGF receptor.

The exact nature of the protease(s) involved is yet to be determined. Here we use activity assays and peptide inhibitors of ICE/Ced-3 proteases to study their role in Fas-mediated killing. We find that while certain inhibitors block DNA fragmentation and chromium release, others do not.

Additionally, we find that CPP32 is not cleaved in all target cells during Fas killing. Although ICE activity (as measured by a fluorogenic substrate) is present in cell lysates from anti-Fas-treated cells, we found no pro-IL-1β-cleaving activity in these lysates.

We have recently shown that CPP32 is involved in granule-mediated cytotoxicity since it is an intracellular substrate for granzyme B (21Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C.

Here we examine the role of ICE/Ced-3 proteases in Fas-mediated killing. Our data suggest the existence of an alternate pathway to DNA fragmentation which does not involve CPP32, since CPP32 is not cleaved in all cells following Fas ligation, and CPP32 inhibition does not suppress DNA fragmentation during Fas-mediated cytotoxicity. The cytolytic hybridoma PMM-1, derived from primary PEL cells, has been described previously (27Kaufmann Y. Berke G. Eshhar Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The L1210 variant transfected with mouse Fas cDNA (L1210-Fas) was kindly provided by Dr. Pierre Golstein, Centre d'Immunologie INSERM-CNRS de Marseille-Luminy, Marseille, France (29Rouvier E. Luciani M.-F. Golstein P. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). EL4 and YAC are mouse lymphomas, Jurkat cells are human T cells. All cells were maintained by continuous culture in RHFM (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (30Helgason C.D. Prendergast J.A. Berke G. Bleackley R.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 3187-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 51Chromium, [3H]thymidine, and [35S]Met were obtained from DuPont NEN. Murine anti-human Fas antibody (IgM) was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., hamster anti-mouse Fas (IgG) was from Pharmingen, and goat anti-hamster IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Target cells (106) were incubated with appropriate numbers of effector cells at 37°C for 4 h, and then all cells were lysed in 10 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) CHAPS, 5 mM dithiothreitol. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and then the entire lysate was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting to polyvinylidene difluoride. The blot was probed using an antibody directed against the p17 subunit of CPP32. Detection was by probing with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by ECL detection (Amersham). Cytolytic activity, assessed by measuring 51Cr release from labeled target cells, and DNA fragmentation, assessed by measuring [3H]thymidine release, were as described previously (28Garner R. Helgason C.D. Atkinson E.A. Pinkoski M.J. Ostergaard H.L. Sorensen O. Fu A. Lapchak P.H. Rabinovitch A. McElhaney J.E. Berke G. Bleackley R.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5413-5421PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled targets were incubated with PMM-1 at the indicated effector-to-target ratio in a total volume of 200 µl in 96-well V-bottom plates for 4 h at 37°C in the presence or absence of the various inhibitors. CTL activity was calculated using the following formula: % lysis = 100 × (sample - spontaneous release)/(total - spontaneous release). Spontaneous release was determined by incubation of targets in the absence of CTL. L1210-Fas or YAC-1 cells were suspended in AIM-V serum-free media (Life Technologies, Inc.) and treated with 1 µg/ml hamster anti-mouse Fas IgG on ice for 30 min. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in AIM-V containing 20 µg/ml goat anti-hamster IgG antibody, in order to cross-link ligated receptors. Incubation proceeded at 37°C for the time points indicated. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40), nuclei were pelleted and the supernatant was assayed for protein content using a BCA Protein Assay Kit from Pierce. The cDNA encoding pro-IL-1β was a gift of Dr. Mike Tocci at Merck Research Laboratories, Rahway, NJ. RNA transcripts were produced by using T7 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a Promega In Vitro Transcription Kit. Template DNA was destroyed after the transcription reaction by treatment with E. coli DNaseI (Promega). In vitro translation was performed in a total volume of 50 µl using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit from Promega. Each reaction included 40 µCi of [35S]Met. Resulting translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For cleavage assays, 50 µg of total protein from lysates of cells treated with anti-Fas antibody were incubated with 3 µl of [35S]pro-IL-1β in a total volume of 30 µl at 37°C overnight. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In other assays, 45 ng of purified human recombinant ICE (generously provided by Nancy Thornberry, Merck Research Laboratories) was added to lysates prior to addition of [35S]pro-IL-1β. Analysis of ICE activity was then as outlined above. Permeability of the inhibitors, as measured by inhibition of IL-1β release, was determined as outlined previously (7Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G.

Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). Inhibition of CPP32 activity was determined as follows. Purified human CPP32 was a generous gift of Dr. Don Nicholson of Merck Frosst Canada Inc., Montráal, and was provided at a concentration of 6 units/µl. This stock solution was diluted 1:50 in 50 mM PIPES/KOH, pH 6.5, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 5 mM DTT for the inhibitor study. The diluted CPP32 (1 µl) was combined with 1 µl of inhibitor stock (diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide) in a final volume of 20 µl and incubated at 37°C for 15 min to allow binding of the inhibitor to CPP32. Following the preincubation, 5 µl of in vitro-translated, fast protein liquid chromatography-purified [35S]PARP (21Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) was added to each reaction, and incubation proceeded at 37°C for an additional 60 min. Reactions were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and cleavage was assessed by autoradiography. Previous work on CTL-mediated cytotoxicity has focused on the role of the apoptotic ICE/Ced-3 cysteine proteases (21Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C.

We have recently shown that the CTL-specific serine protease granzyme B, which is required for the early induction of target cell DNA fragmentation (22Shi L. Kraut R.P. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 23Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), cleaves and activates the ICE/Ced-3 protease CPP32 during granule-mediated killing (21Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Given these results using granule-mediated killing, we wished to further elucidate the role of ICE/Ced-3 proteases, particularly CPP32, during Fas-mediated killing. Our first question was whether CPP32 is cleaved during Fas-induced apoptosis. EL4 and YAC-1 (mouse lymphoma) target cells were incubated with PMM-1 effectors for 4 or 24 h. These effectors kill exclusively through the Fas mechanism (28Garner R. Helgason C.D. Atkinson E.A. Pinkoski M.J. Ostergaard H.L. Sorensen O. Fu A. Lapchak P.H. Rabinovitch A. McElhaney J.E. Berke G. Bleackley R.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5413-5421PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were then assessed for CPP32 status by SDS-PAGE separation followed by Western blotting using an antibody directed against the large subunit of CPP32. The results, shown in Fig. 1A, indicate that when YAC-1 cells are incubated with effectors for 4 h, a band appears at 17 kDa. This band is not present in the time zero sample and represents cleavage of the CPP32 precursor (p32) to the active form (p17/p12). This cleavage product is not apparent in EL4 lysates, even after 24-h incubation with effector cells, and the cleavage in YAC-1 lysates is partial at best. Similar studies using a variant of L1210 transfected with murine Fas cDNA (L1210-Fas) as targets revealed that CPP32 is not cleaved during Fas killing in these cells (data not shown). Concurrent with this study, DNA fragmentation (assessed as [3H]thymidine release) was measured from YAC-1 and EL4 targets incubated with PMM-1 effectors and was found to be normal (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results suggest that CPP32 may be cleaved in some cells during Fas-mediated killing, but is not essential for DNA fragmentation. These results are in direct contrast to our studies of granule-mediated killing, where we found complete cleavage of CPP32 in both EL4 and YAC-1 cells exposed to effectors for 4 h (21Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In addition we have shown that inhibition of CPP32 activity suppresses target cell DNA fragmentation during granule-mediated killing suggesting a critical role for CPP32 in the induction of target cell death during this mode of cytotoxicity (34Darman A.J. Ley T.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21709-21712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It should be noted that DNA fragmentation during Fas-mediated cytotoxicity is consistently more pronounced in YAC-1 cells, where CPP32 is partially cleaved, than in EL4, in which no cleavage of CPP32 is apparent. Thus, cleavage of CPP32 may affect the efficiency of DNA fragmentation. In our next series of experiments, we used a battery of peptide inhibitors, summarized in Table I, which were synthesized for their ability to inhibit ICE/Ced-3 proteases. Briefly, inhibitor 1 contains the prototypic sequence of an ICE/Ced-3 inhibitor, VAD, with an amino-terminal phenylalanine which lacks an amino group. Inhibitor 2 is the Ac-YVAD-CHO ICE inhibitor often used to study ICE/Ced-3 proteases (Ki,ICE = 0.76 nM (7Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Yamin T.-T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. MacCoss M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar)). Inhibitor 3 was originally identified as a CPP32 inhibitor (19Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar) with the structure Ac-DEVD-CHO (Ki,CPP32 = 0.2 nM (19Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar)). Inhibitor 4 is the reduced aldehyde of inhibitor 2 and acts as a negative control. Although extensive kinetic studies have not been performed on CPP32 in the presence of these inhibitors, in an in vitro assay looking at the ability of CPP32 to cleave PARP, inhibitors 1 and 2 inhibit CPP32 in the range 100 nM to 1 µM, far above the Ki of inhibitor 3, suggesting that these peptides are poorly inhibitory toward CPP32 (data not shown).TABLE I.Summary of structures and properties of peptide inhibitorsInhibitorStructureInhibition of ICEaInhibition constants: k (second order rate constant) for inhibitor 1; Ki for inhibitors 2-4.Inhibition of CPP32aInhibition constants: k (second order rate constant) for inhibitor 1; Ki for inhibitors 2-4.FeaturesReference1Ph(Ch2)2C(=O))-Val-Ala-AspC(=O)CH2O-Ph(F)51,100,000 M-1s-1NDbND, not determined.Competitive, irreversible332Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-CHO0.76 nM>10,000 nMCompetitive reversible73Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHOND0.2 nMCompetitive reversible194Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-CH2OH>10,000 nMNDCompetitive reversibleN.

Open table in a new tab Studies using these inhibitors addressed their effect on 51Cr or [3H]thymidine release (as a measure of membrane integrity or DNA fragmentation, respectively) from labeled target cells, using PMM-1 cells (which kill through the Fas pathway) as effectors. The results using L1210-Fas as target cells are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. Similar results were obtained using EL4 cells as targets (data not shown). In these experiments, only inhibitor 1 had a significant effect on target cell 51Cr and [3H]thymidine release induced by ligation of the Fas receptor. Intriguingly, inhibitor 3, the CPP32 inhibitor, had no effect on either chromium or thymidine release, suggesting no role for CPP32 in cell death following ligation of Fas. This result is consistent with our finding that CPP32 is not cleaved in these cells during Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A). For comparison, we studied the effect of these inhibitors on Fas-induced death of YAC-1 cells, in which CPP32 is cleaved following Fas ligation (Fig. 1A). Again, labeled target cells were incubated with PMM-1 effectors in the presence or absence of the inhibitors, and then 51Cr or [3H]thymidine release was measured. The data, presented in Fig. 2, C and D, clearly show that inhibitor 1 has a significant effect on both 51Cr and [3H]thymidine release from these cells following Fas ligation. Additionally, inhibitor 3 (the CPP32 inhibitor) also suppressed [3H]thymidine release from YAC-1 cells. This is in contrast to the results using inhibitor 3 with L1210-Fas cells (Fig. 2, A and B). When taken together with the results from Fig. 1, Fig. 2, A and B, these studies lead to the conclusion that CPP32 is not essential for Fas-induced cell death since it is not always cleaved during Fas-mediated apoptosis. In cells which exhibit no CPP32 cleavage, the CPP32 inhibitor (inhibitor 3) affects neither 51Cr nor [3H]thymidine release. However, there is a correlation between CPP32 cleavage and inhibition of DNA fragmentation by inhibitor 3, suggesting that CPP32 may be involved in Fas-induced cell death in some cells. We wondered whether the results using inhibitor 1 could be explained by inhibition of ICE itself, since other investigators have previously found that an “ICE” activity is involved in Fas-mediated cytotoxicity (24Los M. Van de Craen M. Penning L.C. Schenk H. Westendorp M. Baeuerle P.A. Drüge W. Krammer P.H. Fiers W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nature. 1995; 375: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 25Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), a result which we have confirmed using lysates from anti-Fas-treated cells in a fluorogenic assay (data not shown). To evaluate ICE activity, cell lysates from YAC-1 cells treated with anti-Fas antibody were tested for their ability to cleave pro-IL-1β to produce the 17-kDa IL-1β. To date, ICE is the only known ICE/Ced-3 protease capable of activating pro-IL-1β. [35S]Pro-IL-1β, which is translated as a doublet due to the use of an alternate initiation codon, was incubated overnight with lysates from YAC-1 cells treated with anti-Fas antibody for up to 8 h. The results, shown in Fig. 3A, revealed that treatment of YAC-1 cells with anti-Fas did not result in the appearance of any pro-IL-1β-cleaving activity. Similar results were obtained using lysates from both L1210-Fas and human Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas (data not shown). The lack of ICE activity was not due to the presence of a cellular inhibitor of ICE since supplementing the lysates with purified recombinant human ICE resulted in cleavage of pro-IL-1β (Fig. 3B), detected by appearance of the 17.5-kDa mature IL-1β. Therefore, the increased ICE activity seen during Fas-mediated apoptosis is not due to activation of ICE itself, and the inhibitory action of inhibitor 1 cannot be explained by inhibition of ICE. One possible explanation for the lack of effect of some of these inhibitors during Fas-mediated killing would be that the inhibitor fails to enter the target cell (7Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Yamin T.-T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. MacCoss M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). Using a whole cell assay for IL-1β release, we have found that although the IC50 values for these inhibitors are relatively high compared to the Ki value for ICE (IC50,1 = 3 µM; IC50,2 = 2.5 µM) they are still below the concentration used in these studies (40 µM). Our evidence also supports the idea that inhibitor 3 is able to enter the target cells. In Fas-mediated killing, we have shown that 40 µM inhibitor 3 can suppress DNA fragmentation from YAC-1 cells, which correlates with cleavage of CPP32 in these cells. In addition, we have previously found that 40 µM inhibitor 3 can suppress granule-mediated DNA fragmentation in YAC-1, EL4, and L1210-Fas cells (34Darman A.J. Ley T.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21709-21712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that the failure of these inhibitors to affect Fas-mediated killing cannot be explained by poor membrane permeability. These results suggest the involvement of an ICE-like protease during Fas-mediated killing. This protease is suppressed by inhibitor 1 but is not ICE itself since no ICE activity is apparent in these cells following Fas ligation, and the prototypical ICE inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO (inhibitor 2) has no effect on either 51Cr or [3H]thymidine release from labeled targets during Fas-mediated cytotoxicity. The inhibition profile seen with inhibitor 1 suggests that the protease in question goes on to induce both membrane blebbing and DNA fragmentation within the target cell. While CPP32 may be cleaved and activated during this process, its activity is not essential since CPP32 is not cleaved in all cells. However, in cases where CPP32 is cleaved, this activity is involved in DNA fragmentation. Additionally, it seems that a second mechanism exists for the induction of target cell DNA fragmentation which does not proceed through CPP32 since fragmentation proceeds in the absence of CPP32 activation. This is the first demonstration of apoptosis in the absence of CPP32 activation and suggests that a cell may possess multiple mechanisms which culminate in apoptotic cell death. Since Mch3α has similar kinetics for inhibition by Ac-DEVD-CHO (inhibitor 3, Ki,Mch3α = 1.8 nM (16Fernandes-Alnemri T. Takahashi A. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Fritz L. Tomaselli K.J. Wang L. Yu Z. Croce C.M. Salvesen G. Earnshaw W.C. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6045-6052PubMed Google Scholar)), these results also suggest that Mch3α is not essential for Fas-mediated apoptosis. The presence of an alternate pathway for induction of DNA fragmentation, which does not involve CPP32, is intriguing and has not been previously demonstrated. Based on our results, we would predict that an ICE/Ced-3 protease exists which is suppressed by inhibitor 1 but not by inhibitor 3 and is involved in the induction of 51Cr and [3H]thymidine release during Fas-induced apoptosis. Further work to determine the nature of this pathway and the proteases involved will be essential to the understanding of apoptosis and CTL-mediated cytotoxicity and may aid in the design of novel immunosuppressants.

INTRODUCTIONDNA polymerases must recognize and incorporate the correct dNTP with high fidelity to maintain genetic stability. The interaction of the polymerase with the DNA primer-template is essentially nonspecific, since the enzyme must bind to an “infinite” number of sequences during replication, while dNTP-template base recognition must be highly specific for DNA replication of high fidelity. Since the role of the polymerase in dNTP recognition and selection is poorly understood, elucidation of polymerase-dNTP interactions under a variety of conditions will aid our understanding of this fundamental process.During the last several years our knowledge of the structure of DNA polymerases and their interactions with substrates has evolved significantly. The three-dimensional structures of several DNA polymerases have been solved by x-ray crystallography including the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (1Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G.

Thus, solution studies to characterize the dNTP binding pocket of β-pol permit comparison with recent crystallographic structures. HIV-1 RT utilizes both RNA and DNA templates during proviral DNA synthesis, and chemical modification and cross-linking approaches have been used to define the substrate binding sites (19Sobol R.W.

This approach has been utilized with other template-dependent systems for the study of the substrate binding sites of RNA polymerase (23Grachev M.A. Mustaev A.A.

Anarbaev R.O. Lavrik O.I. Biochimie. 1995; 77: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The chemically reactive substrate analog is covalently incorporated into the enzyme, and polymerase is subsequently labeled by the addition of radioactively labeled substrate. Only substrate analogs bound at the active site will be labeled in this manner. Substrate analogs not bound at the active site would be catalytically inactive and invisible in this analysis. This procedure for affinity labeling permits discrimination between specific and nonspecific labeling of the enzyme.In the present study, a photoreactive analog of dCTP, carrying a photoreactive group on the 4-amino group of the base (Fig. 1), was used for labeling the dNTP binding sites of HIV-1 RT and DNA polymerase β. Two approaches of photolabeling were utilized. The first approach utilizes the introduction of the substrate analog (i.e. FABdCMP) onto the 3′-end of a primer by the activity of the polymerase. After the analog has been incorporated into the DNA, the polymerase is UV-irradiated to covalently attach the 3′-end of the primer to the polymerase. In an alternate approach, the dNTP analog is first covalently attached to the polymerase by UV-irradiation and subsequently labeled by the addition of a 32P-labeled primer-template allowing incorporation of “catalytically competent” cross-linked analog onto the primer. The influence of a chain-terminated primer-template on the level of catalytically competent complex was also examined.DISCUSSIONThe crystallographic analyses of DNA polymerases complexed with nucleic acids substrates has rapidly advanced our understanding of polymerase structure and function (3Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The dNTP binding site of DNA polymerase β has been identified from the crystal structure of the ternary substrate complex (9Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). It is important to complement these crystallographic studies with solution techniques to probe both structure and function. A promising solution technique is the specific labeling of an enzyme based on the “catalytic competence” of a covalently bound substrate. We used a new photoreactive analog of dCTP carrying a photoreactive azido group attached to a spacer arm (Fig. 1) to specifically label the dNTP binding pocket of HIV-1 RT and mammalian β-pol. The azido moiety is approximately 10 Å from the site of attachment at N-4 of the nucleotide base.Using this photoreactive dCTP substrate, we have demonstrated catalytically competent labeling of RT and β-pol (Fig. 2B). This indicates that these enzymes can bind the dCTP analog and subsequently incorporate the covalently cross-linked analog onto a primer. Thus, these DNA polymerases can productively bind dNTPs in the absence of primer-template, and the dNTP bound to the active site can subsequently be incorporated when a primer-template binds to the enzyme. Although steady-state kinetic analysis indicates that an ordered addition of substrates is preferred with primer-template binding first, it is clearly not obligatory based upon the evidence from the current study. To further investigate this point, we determined whether a primer-template will influence the labeling of HIV-1 RT or β-pol. We compared the dCTP analog cross-linked in the presence and absence of a dideoxyprimer-template. The dCTP analog cannot be incorporated onto a terminated primer, but the primer-template could influence the nucleic acid interactions in the dNTP pocket of these DNA polymerases. Our results demonstrate a higher level of UV cross-linking with HIV-1 RT (Fig. 4A), suggesting more favorable interactions within the dNTP binding pocket and concomitant greater labeling in the presence of dideoxyprimer-template. However, this was not observed for DNA polymerase β (Fig. 4B). This differential pattern of labeling with these two polymerases may reflect differences in polymerization mechanism. Whereas the replicative RT is mildly processive, β-pol is distributive on the substrates used in this study. In addition, it has recently been demonstrated that β-pol can incorporate a dNTP in a crystal where the polymerase is bound to the blunt end of duplex DNA (12Beese L.S. Friedman J.M. Steitz T.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14095-14101Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, there is no templating nucleotide, yet dNTP binding and incorporation occur.DNA polymerases for which the structure has been determined have palm subdomains that are structurally very similar. However, if the active site carboxylic acids are used to align the palm subdomains of HIV-1 RT and β-pol, the primer is observed to be entering the active site from opposite sides (9Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 42Steitz T.A. Smerdon S.J. Jäger J. Joyce C.M.

This has led some groups to question the significance of the β-pol ternary complex to whether it is catalytically correct (14Patel P.H. Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J.P. Tantillo C. Clark Jr., A.D. Raag R. Nanni R.G. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5351-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 15Arnold E. Ding J. Hughes S.H. Hostomsky Z. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and others to suggest that the structural similarity observed upon alignment of the palm subdomains of HIV-1 RT and β-pol should be ignored in favor of alignment of the bound DNA substrate (42Steitz T.A. Smerdon S.J. Jäger J. Joyce C.M. Science. 1994; 266: 2022-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To determine whether dNTP contacts in the β-pol ternary complex structure are specific, two side chains observed to interact directly with the incoming dNTP in the crystal structure of the ternary complex were altered by site-directed mutagenesis; the side-chain of Asn279 is within hydrogen bonding distance to the O-2 of the incoming ddCTP, and the C-β of Asp276 is near C-4 and C-5 of the ddCTP base (Fig. 6A). The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the Asp276 mutants was similar to that of wild-type enzyme, due to a parallel modest decrease in both kcat and Km (Fig. 6B). In contrast, kcat for the Asn279 mutants was similar to wild-type enzyme, but the apparent binding affinity was decreased, resulting in a lower catalytic efficiency as compared with wild-type enzyme (40Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12141-12144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Catalytically competent cross-linking of the mutants of Asn279 generated very low labeling, whereas mutants of Asp276 displayed a significantly increased labeling relative to wild-type enzyme (Fig. 7). Labeling was, therefore, dependent on the apparent dNTP binding affinity (Km) and not catalytic efficiency or kcat. Interestingly, removing the charged side chain of Asp276 resulted in a strong increase in FABdCTP labeling. The effect was most pronounced when the acidic side chain was replaced with a hydrophobic side chain (i.e. Val), which could preserve van der Waals contact with the base. These results illustrate that labeling of the β-pol dNTP binding site is specific and that the ternary complex crystal structure can guide further study of dNTP binding and fidelity.It has been demonstrated that the γ-phosphate of the dNTP plays an important role in dNTP binding and selection (44Doronin S.V. Nevinsky G.A. Malygina T.O. Podust V.N. Khomov V.V. Lavrik O.I. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 45Knorre D.G. Lavrik O.I. Nevinsky G.A. Biochimie. 1988; 10: 655-661Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, even for noncomplementary dNTPs, the contribution of the triphosphate moiety and particularly the γ-phosphate is important (45Knorre D.G. Lavrik O.I. Nevinsky G.A. Biochimie. 1988; 10: 655-661Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the similar γ-phosphate binding observed in the binary β-pol·dATP and ternary primer-template-ddCTP complexes (8Sawaya M.R. Pelletier H. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1930-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that interactions of the dNTP base and triphosphate moieties provide essential and nonspecific preliminary arrangement of the incoming dNTP in the dNTP binding pocket of DNA polymerases. The complementary base of the template completes the dNTP pocket and provides a mechanism for “sensing” correct Watson-Crick base pairing. It has recently been demonstrated that the Arg283 side chain of human β-pol plays a crucial role in correctly orienting the template base for efficient nucleotide incorporation with high fidelity (40Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12141-12144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).Finally, UV irradiation of HIV-1 RT with the photoreactive dCTP analog, followed by its incorporation onto a 32P-labeled primer-template, indicates that the location of the dNTP binding pocket utilized for polymerization resides in the 66-kDa subunit of the RT heterodimer (Fig. 2A, lane 5). This exclusive labeling of the p66 subunit is in agreement with previous dNTP cross-linking studies of HIV-1 RT (21Cheng N. Merrill B.M. Painter G.R. Frick L.W. Furman P.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7630-7634Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The catalytically competent labeling of p51·p51 HIV RT homodimers with the dCTP photoreactive substrate was also achieved (data not shown), indicating that an active site can be formed in the absence of p66. When the dCMP moiety of the photoreactive analog was introduced into the 3′-end of the growing primer, a minor labeling of the p51 subunit of the heterodimer was observed (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Under these conditions, the 3′-primer terminus may reorient itself, reflecting a subtle change in conformation or complete dissociation from the enzyme followed by rebinding at an alternate site. Since the active site of the p51 subunit is occluded by the connection subdomain (2Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar), specific cross-linking to the p51 subunit may not be expected to occur. Yet, a short loop between two β-strands (β7 and β8) of p51 is near the p66 active site, so that a minor amount of specific p51 cross-linking might occur. Photoaffinity labeling of heterodimers of HIV-1 RT by oligonucleotides containing the same photoreactive group at the 5′-end of the primer strand indicated equivalent labeling of both subunits. 2S. N. Khodyreva, A. S. Levina, M. I. Dobrikov, A. A. Koshkin, O. I. Lavrik, M. Buckle, M. Ricchetti, P. Roux, and M. Buc, submitted for publication. These data suggest that when the photoreactive probe is introduced at the opposite end of the primer (i.e. 5′-end) from where it was incorporated in this study, it is near a subunit interface contacting both subunits. INTRODUCTIONDNA polymerases must recognize and incorporate the correct dNTP with high fidelity to maintain genetic stability. The interaction of the polymerase with the DNA primer-template is essentially nonspecific, since the enzyme must bind to an “infinite” number of sequences during replication, while dNTP-template base recognition must be highly specific for DNA replication of high fidelity. Since the role of the polymerase in dNTP recognition and selection is poorly understood, elucidation of polymerase-dNTP interactions under a variety of conditions will aid our understanding of this fundamental process.During the last several years our knowledge of the structure of DNA polymerases and their interactions with substrates has evolved significantly. The three-dimensional structures of several DNA polymerases have been solved by x-ray crystallography including the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (1Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G.

Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Thus, solution studies to characterize the dNTP binding pocket of β-pol permit comparison with recent crystallographic structures. HIV-1 RT utilizes both RNA and DNA templates during proviral DNA synthesis, and chemical modification and cross-linking approaches have been used to define the substrate binding sites (19Sobol R.W.

This approach has been utilized with other template-dependent systems for the study of the substrate binding sites of RNA polymerase (23Grachev M.A. Mustaev A.A.

The chemically reactive substrate analog is covalently incorporated into the enzyme, and polymerase is subsequently labeled by the addition of radioactively labeled substrate. Only substrate analogs bound at the active site will be labeled in this manner. Substrate analogs not bound at the active site would be catalytically inactive and invisible in this analysis. This procedure for affinity labeling permits discrimination between specific and nonspecific labeling of the enzyme.In the present study, a photoreactive analog of dCTP, carrying a photoreactive group on the 4-amino group of the base (Fig. 1), was used for labeling the dNTP binding sites of HIV-1 RT and DNA polymerase β. Two approaches of photolabeling were utilized. The first approach utilizes the introduction of the substrate analog (i.e. FABdCMP) onto the 3′-end of a primer by the activity of the polymerase. After the analog has been incorporated into the DNA, the polymerase is UV-irradiated to covalently attach the 3′-end of the primer to the polymerase. In an alternate approach, the dNTP analog is first covalently attached to the polymerase by UV-irradiation and subsequently labeled by the addition of a 32P-labeled primer-template allowing incorporation of “catalytically competent” cross-linked analog onto the primer. The influence of a chain-terminated primer-template on the level of catalytically competent complex was also examined."

Bcd, a homeodomain protein, is distributed as an anterior-to-posterior gradient in the embryo. It stimulates the expression of the hunchback (hb) gene in the anterior half in an all-or-none fashion. We have recently shown that Bcd binds cooperatively to a hb enhancer element and proposed that cooperative DNA binding is facilitated by an interaction between Bcd molecules. In this report, we further analyze the interaction between Bcd molecules and define regions important for protein-protein interaction. We show that the homeodomain of Bcd alone fails to interact with another Bcd molecule efficiently. The protein sequence flanking either side of the homeodomain restores the protein-protein interaction function. Mutations in the homeodomain that affect DNA binding do not adversely affect the protein-protein interaction function, suggesting that the surfaces for DNA binding and protein-protein interaction are separable. Finally, we demonstrate that the homeodomain of Bcd alone, unlike the intact Bcd, fails to bind DNA cooperatively. These results further support the notion that cooperative DNA binding is facilitated by the interaction between Bcd molecules. They strongly suggest that protein-protein interaction is an important property of Bcd for its biological activities.

We previously used phosphorylation-specific antibodies to define major differences in c-erbB-2 tyrosine kinase activity between overexpressing human tumor cell lines (Epstein, R. J., Druker, B. J., Roberts, T. M., and Stiles, C. D. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 10435-10439). Here we extend this approach to define the relationship between c-erbB-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent transmodulation. Phosphorylation-specific antibodies to the juxtamembrane PKC site Thr686 recognize tyrosine-dephosphorylated wild-type c-erbB-2 following G8/DHFR 3T3 cell treatment with PKC agonists. B104-1-1 cells transformed by activated c-erbB-2 express a subset of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors that are homologously phosphorylated on Thr686, indicating that Thr686 phosphorylation alone is insufficient to abrogate receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Similarly, the c-erbB-2-overexpressing human cancer cell lines SK-Ov-3 and BT-474 express constitutively Thr686-phosphorylated receptors. SK-Ov-3 cells express predominantly kinase-inactive c-erbB-2 that is heavily Thr686-phosphorylated, indicating that Thr686 phosphorylation in this line is heterologous in origin. In contrast, BT-474 cells express constitutively autophosphorylated c-erbB-2 despite Thr686 phosphorylation. These results indicate that Thr686 phosphorylation does not directly abolish c-erbB-2 activity and suggest that such phosphorylation reflects constitutive PKC activity induced by either receptor-activating mutations or heterologous growth factors. The latter possibility suggests in turn that c-erbB-2 interacts in an as yet undefined way with heterologous growth factor receptors in human tumor cells.

Using this experimental design, seven PKC isozymes were analyzed for their ability to trans-activate the collagenase and uPA promoters. Our results demonstrate that only PKC γ, ϵ, and η trans-activated the collagenase promoter and that binding of Ap-1 family members to the collagenase 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE) was not responsible for the isozyme-specific trans-activation. In contrast, the uPA promoter was stimulated by all of the PKC isozymes examined (PKC α, βII, γ, γ, ϵ, ζ, and η).

Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar; Asaoka et al., 7Asaoka Y. Nakamura S. Yoshida K. Nishizuka Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 414-417Google Scholar). PKC is also activated by phorbol esters and is considered the major phorbol ester receptor in the cell (Nishizuka, 40Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Google Scholar). Once activated, PKC plays a key regulatory role in a variety of cellular functions such as stimulation or repression of growth, changes in morphology, and modulation of gene expression (reviewed in Nishizuka 41Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Google Scholar; Nishizuka 43Nishizuka Y. Cancer. 1989; 63: 1892-1903Google Scholar). Extensive molecular cloning and biochemical studies have revealed that PKC is a family of related polypeptides. Eleven mammalian genes have been isolated and cloned that code for 12 different PKC isozymes identified by the following Greek symbols α, βI, βII, γ, γ, ϵ, ζ, η, θ, ι, λ, and µ (reviewed in Dekker and Parker, 19Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Google Scholar). protein kinase C 4-β 13-dibutyrate urokinase plasminogen activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element human dermal fibroblast chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay base pair(s) fetal bovine serum. Structurally, the PKC isozymes are heterogeneous and can be divided into four subfamilies based on their primary structure and activation requirements. The conventional isozymes (α, βI, βII, and γ) contain two constant domains, C1 and C2, within their regulatory element and require calcium for activation, whereas the novel isozymes (γ, ϵ, η, and θ) lack a C2 region in their regulatory domain and do not require calcium for activation. The atypical isozymes (ζ, ι, and λ) lack a C2 region and have only one cysteine-rich stretch in their C1 region. These isozymes do not require calcium, diacylglycerol, or phorbol esters for activation (Dekker and Parker, 19Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Google Scholar; Liscovitch and Cantley, 38Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 329-334Google Scholar). The fourth subfamily has only one member (PKC µ). The unique feature of this isozyme is its long N-terminal region that may function as a transmembrane domain. Like the novel and atypical PKC isozymes, PKC µ lacks the C2 domain and does not require calcium for activation (Johannes et al., 33Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Google Scholar; Johannes et al., 34Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Dieterich S. Oberhagemann P. Link G. Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 303-307Google Scholar). In addition to structural differences, the PKC isozymes also display functional heterogeneity due, in part, to differences in tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and substrate selectivity. For example, some of the isozymes are present in the majority of tissues investigated (α, γ, ζ) whereas others (γ, η, and θ) are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (Dekker and Parker, 19Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Google Scholar; Hug and Sarre, 30Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been reported that in resting cells PKC α, β, and ζ are found in the cytosol; PKC θ is predominantly in the particulate fraction, and PKC η is located in the nucleus. The subcellular location of PKC γ and ϵ is cell type-specific (reviewed in Hug and Sarre, 30Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Google Scholar). Furthermore, substrate selectivity of the PKC isozymes has been demonstrated. Goode et al. (22Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Google Scholar) have shown that glycogen synthase kinase-3B (GSK-3B), an enzyme involved in the activation of c-Jun (a member of the Ap-1 transcription factor family), is a much better substrate for PKC α, βI, and γ than it is for PKC βII, whereas PKC ϵ is unable to significantly phosphorylate GSK-3B. This isozyme hierarchy for substrate phosphorylation is seen with a number of PKC substrates including the epidermal growth factor receptor (Ido et al., 31Ido M. Sekiguchi K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 215-218Google Scholar), the neuron-specific protein F1/GAP-43 (Sheu et al., 51Sheu F.-S. Marais R.M. Parker P.J. Bazan N.G. Routtenberg A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 1236-1243Google Scholar), and the vitamin D receptor (Hsieh et al., 29Hsieh J.-C. Jurutka P.W. Galligan M.A. Terpening C.M. Haussler C.A. Samuels D.S. Shimizu Y. Shimizu N. Haussler M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9315-9319Google Scholar). This high degree of structural and functional heterogeneity found among the isozymes suggests that each isozyme plays a unique role within the cell. PKC has been shown to be associated with enhanced expression of both the collagenase and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) genes (Rajabi et al., 47Rajabi M.R. Solomon S. Poole A.R. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1992; 167: 194-200Google Scholar; Juarez et al., 35Juarez J. Clayman G. Nakajima M. Tanabe K.K. Saya H. Nicolson G.L. Boyd D. Int. J.

Due to the large heterogeneity that exists among the PKC isozymes as described above, it is possible that the isozymes regulate the collagenase and uPA promoters differently. To test this idea, co-transfections were performed in human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) with a plasmid that expresses an individual PKC isozyme and a plasmid containing either the porcine uPA or human collagenase promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene. Our results indicate that these two promoters are regulated differently by the PKC isozymes and suggest a biological explanation for the heterogeneity that exists within the PKC family. The plasmid containing the human collagenase promoter linked to the cat gene, −1200/+63 Cat (Angel et al., 3Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlick P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7 (a): 2256-2266Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Hans Jobst Rahmsdorf. pCAT4660 (Cassady et al., 16Cassady A.I. Stacey K.J. Nimmo K.A. Murphy K.M. Ahe D. Pearson D. Botteri F.M. Nagamine Y. Hume D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6839-6847Google Scholar), a plasmid containing the porcine uPA promoter sequences linked to the cat gene, was a gift from David A. Hume. The expression vector pSVHNX-neo was constructed from the parent plasmid pSV2HNXB that contains the β-lactamase gene and a prokaryotic origin of replication from pBR322 (pBR322 sequences 2064-4361), the SV40 origin of replication and early promoter (SV40 sequences 270-5190), a 16-bp polylinker containing unique HindIII, NruI, XhoI, and BglII sites, the SV40 t antigen intervening sequence (SV40 sequences 4100-4710), and the SV40 early region polyadenylation signal (SV40 sequences 2770-1782). pSVHNX-neo was then constructed by the following steps. The neomycin resistance gene was isolated from pSV2-neo (Southern and Berg, 53Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341Google Scholar) on an NdeI to BamHI fragment, and the ends were made blunt with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I plus dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and TTP. This fragment was then inserted in the unique BamHI site of pSV2HNXB that previously had been blunted as described above. An oligonucleotide containing an NheI site flanked by XhoI sites was then ligated into the unique XhoI site creating a unique NheI site. The individual PKC cDNAs were then ligated (either cohesive or blunt-ended) into the NheI site; isolation and cloning of these cDNAs have been described (Basta et al., 11Basta P. Strickland M.B.

A plasmid containing the PEA-3 and TRE of the collagenase promoter, pTRETK-CAT, was constructed as follows. The thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus type I was isolated from pHSV-106 (Life Technologies, Inc.) on a PvuII to BglII fragment. This fragment was blunted with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I as described above and inserted at the XbaI site of pCAT-Basic (Promega Corp.) that had also been made blunt. A 71-bp oligonucleotide containing the collagenase PEA-3 and TRE (collagenase promoter sequences −111 to −40) was then inserted into the SphI site creating pTRETK-CAT. Human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) were purchased from Clonetics Corp. and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 2 m -glutamine (Sigma) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone Laboratories). One day prior to transfection, HDF were plated at a density of 106 cells/100-mm culture dish. Calcium phosphate DNA precipitates (Wigler et al., 55Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Google Scholar) were prepared with 5 µg of either −1200/+63 CAT or pCAT4660 and 10 µg of either a plasmid expressing an individual PKC isozyme or the control vector pSVHNX-neo. Four hours after transfection, 1.0 ml of 15% glycerol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was placed on the cells for 60 s. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then fresh culture medium with either 10 or 1% FBS was added to the dishes. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and then removed from the dishes by scraping in TEN buffer (40 m Tris, pH 7.5, 1.0 m EDTA, 150 m NaCl). After centrifugation, the pellet of cells was resuspended in 100 µl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.0 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A cellular lysate was prepared by three consecutive cycles of freeze/thaw, and the protein concentration was determined for each lysate using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). The amount of Cat activity or the concentration of Cat protein present in the lysates was then determined. Cat activity was measured according to the method of Gorman et al. (23Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 µg of protein was used for each assay and diluted to 145 µl with 0.25 Tris, pH 7.8, containing 4 m acetyl-CoA (Boehringer Mannheim) and 0.5 µCi of [14C]chloramphenicol (DuPont NEN). After incubating at 37°C overnight, 1.0 ml of ethyl acetate was added to stop the reaction and to extract the acetylated and nonacetylated chloramphenicol species. The chloramphenicol species were then separated by ascending thin layer chromatography in a chamber saturated with a chloroform:methanol (95:5) solvent. The chloramphenicol species were quantitated with the Betascope 603 Blot Analyzer (Betagen Corporation). Percentage of acetylation was calculated by dividing the quantity of acetylated chloramphenicol by the sum of all chloramphenicol species. The concentration of Cat protein present in transfected cells was measured with an ELISA kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Manufacturer's recommendations were followed with a few modifications. Each sample contained 25 µg of protein dissolved in sample buffer to 100 µl; this solution was transferred to a microtiter plate well containing Cat antibody and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. The rest of the procedure was followed according to the manufacturer's recommendations until the final stage when samples were incubated at room temperature with substrate plus enhancer for at least 15 min; the absorbance of each sample was then measured at 405 nm with a Dynatech MR 5000 (Dynatech Laboratories) microplate reader. Cat protein concentrations were extrapolated from a standard curve prepared with Cat enzyme supplied in the kit. The degree of trans-activation of the uPA or collagenase promoter by the PKC isozymes was calculated and expressed as fold activation. Fold activation was calculated by dividing the percentage of acetylation (TLC method) or the amount of Cat protein produced (ELISA method) from each co-transfection by that value generated from the co-transfection containing the control plasmid, pSVHNX-neo. Statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software JMP (SAS Institute Inc.), version 3.0. To determine if a given isozyme had activity significantly greater than the control, a one sample t test was performed on the logarithm of the fold activation for each isozyme. The logarithm transformation was used because fold activation was determined on a ratio scale. One-sided p values are reported because only increased activity is of interest. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. HDF were transfected with 10 µg of pSVHNX-neo, pSPKCϵ, or pSPKCζ as described above. Forty-eight hours after the glycerol shock, nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Dignam et al. (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). The probe for the gel mobility retardation assays was a 17-bp, double-stranded oligonucleotide encompassing the TRE motif from the human collagenase promoter. The sequence of this oligonucleotide is as follows, AAGCATGAGTCAGACAC. The oligonucleotide was labeled at the 5′ ends with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN). Nuclear extracts (1 µg) were incubated under conditions similar to those described by Carthew et al. (15Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 439-448Google Scholar) at 25°C for 30 min with 0.03 pmol (approximately 10,000 cpm) of probe. The 10-µl reaction mixture also contained 200 ng of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 15% glycerol, 20 n HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 m KCl, 5 m MgCl2, 0.2 m EDTA, and 0.5 m dithiothreitol. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on either a 4 or 4-20% gradient, nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. After the gel was dried, the protein-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography. The quantity of probe in each band was determined by analyzing the dried gel with a Betascope 603 Blot Analyzer (Betagen Corp.) or by analyzing the autoradiogram with an Ultrascan XL Laser Densitometer (Pharmacia). To investigate PKC isozyme regulation of promoters containing classical phorbol ester-responsive sequences, co-transfections were performed in HDF with a plasmid containing either the human collagenase promoter or the porcine uPA promoter linked to the cat gene (−1200/+63 CAT or pCAT 4660, respectively) and either the control vector (pSVHNX-neo) or a plasmid expressing an individual PKC isozyme (“Materials and Methods,”Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2A, only PKC γ, ϵ, and η (members of the novel PKC subfamily) trans-activated the collagenase promoter, whereas PKC α, βII, γ, and ζ were unable to significantly enhance transcription above that of the control vector, pSVHNX-neo. Interestingly, the uPA promoter was significantly trans-activated to varying degrees by all of the PKC isozymes tested (Fig. 2B). Taken together these results demonstrate that the collagenase promoter is regulated in an isozyme-selective manner, and at least two phorbol ester-inducible promoters, collagenase and uPA, are not regulated in a similar manner by the PKC isozymes. Because each isozyme significantly trans-activated at least one promoter in the study discussed above, we felt that all of the exogenous PKC isozymes were in a functional state. To investigate further this issue, the co-transfections were repeated with 1% FBS instead of the usual 10% in the culture medium following co-transfection. Under these conditions, none of the isozymes trans-activated the collagenase promoter (Fig. 3A), and only PKC ϵ weakly stimulated the uPA promoter above that seen with the control vector (Fig. 3B). Therefore, these data suggest that a substance present in the FBS was responsible for activating the exogenous isozymes that resulted in the data shown in Fig. 2. The observation that only PKC ϵ and η strongly trans-activated the collagenase promoter represents an interesting and unique finding. Therefore, additional studies were performed to investigate the mechanism for selective gene regulation. The sequence responsible for phorbol ester induction of the collagenase promoter is located between −111 and −40 and contains both a PEA-3 and a TRE motif and a TTCA sequence (Angel et al., 4Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49 (b): 729-739Google Scholar; Gutman and Wasylyk, 24Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Google Scholar; Auble and Brinckeroff, 8Auble D.T. Brinckeroff C.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4629-4635Google Scholar). To determine if this sequence is involved in PKC ϵ and η trans-activation, a plasmid was first constructed that contains −111 to −40 of the collagenase promoter upstream of the HSV-1 thymidine kinase promoter linked to the cat gene, pTRETK-CAT (Fig. 4A). Co-transfections were then performed with pTRETK-CAT and either the control vector (pSVHNX-neo), pSPKCϵ, pSPKCζ, or pSPKCη. Consistent with the results described above, PKC ϵ and η significantly trans-activated this region of the collagenase promoter, whereas ζ was unable to stimulate transcription above that seen with the control vector (Fig. 4B). Although the fold induction was less when the smaller region of the promoter was used compared with the results with the entire promoter (4.0 to 4.5 versus 5.5 to 7.5, respectively), regulation of the collagenase promoter by PKC ϵ and η appears to be mediated, at least in part, through the PEA-3/TRE motifs. PKC isozymes have been implicated in altering the DNA binding activity of c-Jun, a member of the Ap-1 family of transcription factors (Boyle et al., 14Boyle W.J. Smeal T. Defize L.H.K. Angel P. Woodgett J.R. Karin M. Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 573-584Google Scholar; Jackson, 32Jackson S.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 104-108Google Scholar; Goode et al., 22Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Google Scholar). In addition, Ap-1 family members have been shown to regulate transcription of the collagenase promoter at the TRE site (Angel et al., 4Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49 (b): 729-739Google Scholar; Angel et al., 5Angel P. Allegretto E.A. Okino S.T. Hattori K. Boyle W.J. Hunter T. Karin M. Nature. 1988; 332: 166-171Google Scholar; Chiu et al., 17Chiu R. Boyl W.J. Meek J. Smeal T. Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 54: 541-552Google Scholar). Because PKC ϵ enhanced transcription of the collagenase promoter at the PEA-3/TRE, a gel mobility retardation assay was performed to determine if Ap-1 family members are bound to the collagenase TRE when exogenous PKC ϵ is present. A 17-bp oligonucleotide probe representing the native collagenase TRE, nuclear extracts prepared from cells transfected with pSPKCϵ, and varying concentrations of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides representing either the native or a mutant TRE sequence were used in the gel mobility retardation assay. The mutant sequence has previously been shown to have very little TRE activity (Angel et al., 4Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49 (b): 729-739Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 5A, a single band was produced in all lanes suggesting that a single protein or a single protein complex is bound to the TRE. The amount of bound probe in each lane was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” As seen in Fig. 5B, the native TRE sequence competed for Ap-1 factor binding in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the mutant TRE oligonucleotide efficiently competed for binding only at the 100-fold concentration. These results demonstrate that an Ap-1 family member is specifically bound to the TRE sequence when exogenous PKC ϵ is present in the nuclear extracts. Although a single band was produced in the gel mobility retardation assay described above, subtle changes in the form of the protein or complex of proteins bound to the TRE may have occurred in response to exogenous PKC ϵ. We have found that better resolution of protein-DNA complexes from gel mobility retardation assays can be obtained on gradient, nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (Birch et al., 12Birch K.A. Heath W.F. Hermeling R.N. Johnston C.M. Stramm L. Dell C. Smith C. Williamson J.R. Reifel-Miller A.E. Diabetes. 1996; 42: 642-650Google Scholar). Therefore, additional gel mobility retardation assays were performed to further investigate the molecular mechanism for PKC ϵ-selective gene regulation. As seen in Fig. 6A, two distinct bands (B1 and B2) were consistently produced when binding reactions containing nuclear extracts prepared from cells transfected with the control vector, pSPKCϵ, or pSPKCζ and incubated with the 17-bp TRE probe were resolved on 4-20% gradient gels. These two bands could represent either two different Ap-1 dimers or two forms, perhaps phosphorylation alterations, of the same dimer bound to the TRE. As mentioned above, PKC isozymes have been shown to alter the DNA binding activity of Ap-1 family members (Boyle et al., 14Boyle W.J. Smeal T. Defize L.H.K. Angel P. Woodgett J.R. Karin M. Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 573-584Google Scholar; Jackson, 32Jackson S.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 104-108Google Scholar; Goode et al., 22Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Google Scholar); therefore, the density of B1 and B2 in each lane was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Only small variations in the total amount of bound probe (B1 + B2) were detected (Fig. 6B); however, the relative amount of probe present in B1 compared with B2 was altered. The amount of probe bound in B1 increased while that in B2 decreased when nuclear extracts prepared from cells transfected with pSPKCϵ or pSPKCζ were compared with cells transfected with the control vector, pSVHNX-neo (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that the total amount of protein bound to the TRE was altered only slightly by exogenous PKC isozymes, whereas the protein or form of protein bound was significantly altered. Surprisingly, the binding pattern and the quantity of bound probe were very similar for extracts prepared from cells transfected with pSPKCϵ or pSPKCζ. These observations suggest that trans-activation of the collagenase promoter by PKC ϵ is not due to alterations in the binding of Ap-1 family members to the TRE motif. Due to the heterogeneity that exists among the PKC family of isozymes and reports that suggest that individual isozymes may have distinct roles in biological functions (Nishizuka, 42Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Google Scholar; Borner et al., 13Borner C. Guadagno S.N. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12892-12899Google Scholar; Dekker and Parker, 19Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Google Scholar), we designed the study presented here to investigate trans-activation of two phorbol ester-responsive genes by individual PKC isozymes. Our finding that the collagenase promoter is regulated only by the novel PKC isozymes γ, ϵ, and η clearly demonstrates that some promoters are regulated by specific PKC isozymes and supports the idea that individual isozymes have unique functions within the cell. Other investigators have also presented data demonstrating isozyme-selective gene regulation. Kariya et al. (36Kariya K.-I. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10023-10026Google Scholar) have shown that the β-myosin heavy chain promoter is regulated better by PKC β than by α. In addition, the primary response gene, ST2, has recently been shown to be regulated by PKC βII, γ, ζ, and η but not by α, γ, or ϵ (Kieser et al., 37Kieser A. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 189-193Google Scholar), and Hata et al. (26Hata A. Akita Y. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9122-9129Google Scholar) have shown that a concatenated TRE cluster is trans-activated by PKC α, βII, and ϵ but not γ. Although the results by these investigators are interesting, our data may more accurately reflect PKC isozyme regulation as we have used full-length cellular promoters, transiently expressed PKC isozymes, and physiological stimulation. In addition to isozyme-selective gene regulation, we have shown that two phorbol ester-responsive promoters are regulated differently by the PKC isozymes (compare Fig. 2A and 2B). The TRE in both the human collagenase promoter (Angel et al., 3Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlick P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7 (a): 2256-2266Google Scholar) and the porcine uPA promoter (Rorth et al., 50Rorth P. Nerlov C. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5009-5017Google Scholar) is required for induction of gene expression by tumor-promoting agents. In addition, the PEA-3 site on these promoters acts synergistically with the TRE to achieve maximal levels of induction (Gutman and Wasylyk, 24Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Google Scholar; Rorth et al., 50Rorth P. Nerlov C. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5009-5017Google Scholar). Although the PEA/TRE motifs found in these promoters are similar, their sequences, the spacing between the PEA-3 and TRE, and their location within the promoter are unique to each gene (Angel et al., 3Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlick P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7 (a): 2256-2266Google Scholar; Cassady et al., 16Cassady A.I. Stacey K.J. Nimmo K.A. Murphy K.M. Ahe D. Pearson D. Botteri F.M. Nagamine Y. Hume D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6839-6847Google Scholar). While it remains unknown whether these differences are responsible for the diverse trans-activation profiles seen in this study, it is possible that substrates for the different PKC isozymes differentiate the two promoters at these sites. Similar to our finding that serum concentrations greater than 1% are necessary to achieve trans-activation (Fig. 2, Fig. 3), other investigators have shown that a substance present in serum activates PKC (Abdel-Ghany et al., 2Abdel-Ghany M. El-Gendy K. Zhang S. Raden D. Racker E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1761-1765Google Scholar). In fact, Ohno et al. (45Ohno S. Mizuno K. Adachi Y. Hata A. Akita Y. Akimoto K. Osada S. Hirai S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17495-17501Google Scholar) report that serum selectively activates the PKC isozymes. Our data with the collagenase promoter (Fig. 2A) is consistent with the data of Ohno et al. (45Ohno S. Mizuno K. Adachi Y. Hata A. Akita Y. Akimoto K. Osada S. Hirai S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17495-17501Google Scholar), i.e. serum activation leads to selective trans-activation by the novel PKC isozymes. However, our findings with the uPA promoter (Fig. 2B) suggest that all of the isozymes are functional, and the inability to trans-activate the collagenase promoter by some of the isozymes (PKC α, βII, γ, and ζ) in Fig. 2A is due to a mechanism distal to isozyme activation. An Ap-1 family member was shown to be bound to the collagenase TRE when nuclear extracts prepared from HDF transfected with pSPKCϵ were used in a gel mobility retardation assay (Fig. 5, A and B). When additional binding reactions were separated on 4-20% gradient gels, two distinct bands were clearly seen (Fig. 6A). The two bands could represent two different Ap-1 dimers (such as c-Jun/c-Jun or c-Jun/c-Fos) bound to the TRE. Different dimers have been shown previously to migrate to different positions in a gel mobility retardation assay (de Groot et al., 18de Groot R.P. Karperien M. Pals C. Karperien W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2523-2532Google Scholar). Alternatively, the two bands could represent two different forms, perhaps phosphorylation forms, of the same dimer. Both c-Fos and c-Jun have been shown to be phosphorylated by a number of protein kinases (Abate et al., 1Abate C. Marshak D.R. Curran T. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2179-2185Google Scholar; Jackson, 32Jackson S.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 104-108Google Scholar; Smeal et al., 52Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Pirrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Google Scholar; Pulverer et al., 46Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Google Scholar), and phosphorylation is known to alter the electrophoretic migration of c-Fos (Barber and Verma, 10Barber J.R. Verma I.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2201-2211Google Scholar). Although PKC ϵ trans-activates the full-length collagenase promoter (Fig. 2A) and the −111 to −40 region from the collagenase promoter (Fig. 4B), it does not appear to alter the binding pattern (Fig. 6A) or enhance total binding (Fig. 6B) of Ap-1 family members to the TRE. The most likely explanation for this finding is that the TRE is not solely responsible for trans-activation. The PEA-3 site or a combination of the TTCA, PEA-3, and TRE may all be required for trans-activation of the collagenase promoter as suggested by Auble and Brinckeroff (8Auble D.T. Brinckeroff C.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4629-4635Google Scholar). Interestingly, other investigators have also shown that PKC isozyme-selective trans-activation is not necessarily consistent with the binding of Ap-1 family members at the TRE. Hata et al. (26Hata A. Akita Y. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9122-9129Google Scholar) have shown that PKC γ is unable to stimulate transcription from multiple TREs linked to the cat gene, although γ enhances binding of proteins at the TRE site. Our findings together with those of others suggest that additional factors and/or an alteration of bound Ap-1 family members may be necessary to achieve transcriptional activation at this site. In fact, the results shown in Fig. 6C suggest that either the type of protein (Ap-1 dimer) or form of protein bound to the TRE was altered in PKC ϵ-transfected cells; however, these alterations do not appear to correlate with isozyme-selective transcriptional activity as an increase in B1 compared with B2 was also seen with nuclear extracts prepared from cells transfected with pSPKCζ. In conclusion, we have shown that two promoters (human collagenase and porcine uPA) that contain classical phorbol ester-responsive elements were regulated differently by PKC isozymes. The collagenase promoter was only trans-activated significantly by PKC γ, ϵ, and η, whereas the uPA promoter was stimulated by additional isozymes. We also show that the sequences between −111 to −40 of the collagenase promoter were at least partially responsible for the isozyme-specific activity. Although the exact mechanism for this specificity remains unknown, we demonstrate that changes in binding of Ap-1 family members to the TRE motif induced by PKC ϵ does not correlate with isozyme selective activation. We are grateful to Dr. James R. Miller and Steve Kovacevic for providing us with the PKCβII cDNA and to Sphinx Pharmaceuticals for providing us with the cDNAs for PKC α, γ, γ, ϵ, ζ, and η. We also thank Dr. Mel Baez for making pSV2HNXB available for our studies."

These transformed cell lines were treated with 0.01 mM H2O2 for 25 days and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activities of these cell lines were measured. The CAT activities of transformed cell lines were latent in normal culture conditions, but were activated by retreatment with 0.2 mM H2O2 for 1 h.

Biggar R.J. Weiss S.H. Melbye M. Goedert J.J. Ann. Intern. Med. 1985; 103: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The production of HIV-1 has been found to be very low before onset of the disease, although the provirus DNA is inserted into the host cell DNA (2Fauci A.S. N. Engl. J.

The latent HIV-1 can be activated by superinfection with another DNA virus such as the cytomegalovirus or herpes virus (4Mosca J.D. Bednarik D.P. Raj N.B.K. Rosen C.A. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Pitha P.M. Nature. 1987; 325: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), but little is known about this mechanism of activation of latent HIV-1. On the other hand, the nuclear factor κ-B (NF-κB) is known to be a strong activator of the HIV-1 promoter (5Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar), and activation of NF-κB by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been reported (6Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that oxidative stress such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide may be important in the activation of latent HIV-1. human immunodeficiency virus 1 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase hydrogen peroxide long term dilute H2O2 N-acetyl-L-cysteine long terminal repeat base pairs. To examine this possibility, we transfected pCD12 (HIV-LTR-CAT) plasmid into human lymphoid cell lines and obtained stable transformants (cf. Refs. 4Mosca J.D. Bednarik D.P. Raj N.B.K. Rosen C.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24553-24556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cell lines showed low CAT activity like latent HIV-1 in normal culture condition. The CAT activity was markedly elevated when these transformant cells were cultured in the presence of 0.2 mM H2O2 for 1 h, but on treatment of 0.05 mM H2O2 the CAT activity remained at a low level. However, when the transformed cells were pretreated with a dilute H2O2 (0.01 mM) for about 25 days, the CAT activity of transformed cell lines could be markedly elevated by retreatment with 0.05 mM H2O2 for 1 h. This activation of the HIV-1 promoter by a comparatively low concentration of H2O2 seems interesting, because patients latently infected with HIV-1 presumably receive various oxidative stresses as results of physical movements and metabolism during the long latency period (8Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar, 9Hayaishi O. Ueda K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 46: 95-116Crossref Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In the early period of latency, the patients may have only cells of the “low CAT activity type” but when they undergo oxidative stress for a long time like cells during a long term culture with a dilute H2O2, the latent virus may be activated and comparatively low oxidative stress may cause marked activation of HIV-1 gene expression. From this view point, our transformed cell lines may act as a good model of lymphoid cells in patients infected with HIV-1 (cf. Refs. 10Nabel G. Baltimore D.

The medium was changed 18 h after protoplast fusion, and the cells were cultured further for 2 days. Then they were selected with G418 in RPMI 1640 medium. After the selection with G418 for about 3 weeks, permanently transformed clones (HL60CD, U937CD, MOLT4CD (transformed by pCD12) and HL60SV, U937SV, MOLTSV (transformed by pSV2CAT), respectively (cf.

These cell lines were treated with H2O2 (0, 0.05, or 0.2 mM) for 1 h and then they were cultured in normal RPMI 1640 for 48 h, collected, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Samples of 5 × 105 cells were suspended in 0.25 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and cellular extracts were prepared by five cycles of freezing (-80°C) and thawing. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was measured by incubating whole cell extracts with 14C-labeled chloramphenicol and 5 mM acetyl coenzyme A at 37°C for 18 h. Acetylated chloramphenicol was separated from nonacetylated chloramphenicol by ascending thin-layer chromatography (16Kurata S-I. Wakabayashi T. Ito Y. Miwa N. Ueno R. Marumouchi T. Kurata N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Chromatograms were examined and quantitated with a Fuji image analyzer BA100. Nuclear proteins binding to the NF-κB binding motif were detected by the Life Technologies, Inc. kit. Briefly, 42-mer DNA containing two NF-κB DNA motifs (GGGGACTTTCC) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP for binding with nuclear extracts. Nuclear extracts were prepared at intervals by the method of Dignam et al. (17Dignam J.D. Lebowiz E.F. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) after treatment of the cells with H2O2. Samples of 5 ng of end-labeled DNA fragments were bound with 3 mg of nuclear proteins in a solution of 20 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.9), 100 mM KCl, 20%(v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2, 125 mM spermidine, and 3 mg of poly(dI-dC) for 20 min. The preparations were then separated by electrophoresis in 4% polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate-EDTA buffer and autoradiographed. For competition assays, excess amounts of cold 42-mer fragments and a synthetic mutant sequence of the NF-κB motif (TCGACAGAATTCACTTTCCGAGAGGCTCGA) (18Lenardo M.J. Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Baltimore O. Cell. 1989; 57: 287-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) were used for binding assays. For supershift assays, 10-fold diluted rabbit antiserum against NF-κB (p65) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was also added to the binding reaction. The complexes of NF-κB motif DNA, nuclear protein, and antibody were identified by electrophoresis as described previously (19Metzger S. Halaas J.L. Breslow J.L. Sladek F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16831-16838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-LTR DNA was digested with SacI and PvuII to obtain a 120-bp DNA fragment (16Kurata S-I. Wakabayashi T. Ito Y. Miwa N. Ueno R. Marumouchi T. Kurata N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This 120-bp fragment, which contained the NF-κB motif, was also end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP for binding with nuclear extracts. Band shift assays were performed as described above. After band shift assay, shifted bands were removed and eluted from the gel by electrophoresis and their radioactivities determined. The protein-DNA complexes obtained were immunoprecipitated with anti-NF-κB p65 rabbit serum, and the recovery of radioactivity of [32P]-labeled DNA was also determined. Transformed cell lines were obtained by the protoplast fusion method as described previously (7Kurata S-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24553-24556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three cell lines (HL60, U937, and MOLT4) transformed by pCD12 (HIV-LTR-CAT) plasmid were named HL60CD, U937CD, and MOLT4CD, respectively, and the same cells transformed by pSV2CAT plasmid were named HL60SV, U937SV, and MOLT4SV, respectively (cf. Ref. 7Kurata S-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24553-24556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and MOLT4 cells transformed by mutant pCD12 were named MOLT4CD*. For short term H2O2 treatment, these cell lines were treated with 0, 0.05, or 0.2 mM H2O2 for 1 h, then washed with normal medium (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum), and cultured for 48 h. Samples of 5 × 105 of these cells were then used for measurement of CAT activity by thin-layer chromatography (Fig. 1A, part a). The CAT activities were measured as percentage conversion of the acetylated form of chloramphenicol from extracts derived of transformed cell lines. The CAT activities of HL60CD cell line treated with 0, 0.05, and 0.2 mM H2O2 were 0, 5.2, and 65.3%, respectively, and almost the same results were obtained in U937CD and MOLT4CD cell lines (Fig. 1A, part b). It was found that on short term (1 h) H2O2 treatment with a moderate concentration of H2O2 (0.05 mM), the CAT activity of pCD12-transformed cell lines were only weak; however, a high concentration of H2O2 (0.2 mM) treatment resulted in a marked activation of CAT activity (cf. Ref. 6Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar). The CAT activity of pSV2CAT-transformed cells were extremely high and did not change on treatment with H2O2, but the CAT activity of MOLT4CD* was low and did not change on treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 1A). For long term dilute H2O2 treatment, transformed cell lines were treated with 0.01 mM H2O2 for 25 days. At 5-day intervals 0.01 mM H2O2-treated transformed cell lines were collected. The cells were retreated with 0, 0.05, or 0.2 mM of H2O2 for 1 h, washed with normal medium, and cultured for an additional 48 h. The CAT activities of the HL60CD cell line measured as a percentage conversion of the acetylated form of chloramphenicol after short term H2O2 treatment (0, 0.05, 0.2 mM for 1 h) were about 0, 5.2, and 65.3%, respectively (cf. Fig. 1A), but in long term treatment (25 days) the CAT activities were about 7.0, 68.4, and 71.0%, respectively (Fig. 1B). It was found that long term dilute H2O2 treatment (4 h/day for 20 days or more) slightly elevated the CAT activity. And when these cells were retreated by 0.05 mM H2O2 for 1 h, marked elevations of CAT activity were observed. Almost the same results were obtained in U937CD and MOLT4CD cell lines. This sensitization of CAT activity by dilute H2O2 was abolished by the antioxidant (NAC, 20 mM) treatment (Fig. 1C). Marked elevation of CAT activity induced by a moderate concentration (0.05 mM) of H2O2 after long term dilute H2O2 treatment may indicate that the latent HIV-1 promoter in infected cells became sensitive on long term treatment with a low concentration (0.01 mM) of H2O2. In contrast CAT activity of MOLT4CD* cell remained at a low level after long term dilute H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1B; cf. Fig. 1A). Many patients infected with HIV-1 show a long latency period. If this latency of infected patients corresponds with the “latency” of expression from the HIV promoter in transformed cells, sensitization of the HIV-1 promoter in transformed cells in the presence of a low concentration of H2O2 may represent one of the activation processes of latent HIV-1 in infected patients. Patients presumably suffer oxidative stress during the long latency period, so long term treatment of H2O2 of transformed cells may be a useful model for the onset of AIDS by oxidative stress. Binding proteins of the NF-κB DNA motif were detected with a Life Technologies, Inc. kit. A 42-mer DNA containing two GGGGACTTTCC motifs was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and added to nuclear proteins extracted from transformed cells treated with 5-day intervals of 0.01 mM H2O2 for 25 days and then 0, 0.05, and 0.2 mM of H2O2 for 1 h. Then the labeled 42-mer DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis and their mobility shifts were examined. The time course of binding to the 42-mer DNA on long term dilute H2O2 treatment of transformed cells was examined for 25 days (Fig. 2A, parts a and b). It was found that the percentage shift of the 42-mer DNA fragment corresponded well with CAT activity in pCD12 transformed cell lines. The same band shift patterns were also obtained in the mutant pCD12 transformed cell line (MOLT4CD*), but the CAT activity of this cell was low (Fig. 2A, cf. Fig. 1B). These shifted bands disappeared on addition of 50-fold excess amounts of unlabeled 42-mer DNA fragments, but not on addition of 25-fold excess of unlabeled mutant NF-κB motif (Fig. 2A, part a). When the above treated cells were also pretreated with NAC (20 mM), the shifted bands decreased in intensity or disappeared (Fig. 2B). On treatment with NAC, the percentage shift of the labeled 42-mer DNA fragment also corresponded with the CAT activity in pCD12 transformed cell lines (Fig. 2B, cf. Fig. 1C). The shifted bands from nuclear extract of 0.2 mM H2O2-treated cells were also supershifted by antisera against NF-κB p65 protein, and several supershifted bands appeared (in Fig. 2B). These results suggest that pCD12 transformed cells potentially produce an NF-κB-like transcription activating factor by long term dilute H2O2 treatment, corresponding with the CAT activity. To examine the binding activity of the NF-κB-like factor with the transcription-activating motif in HIV-1-LTR, a SacI,PvuII fragment (120 bp) containing the NF-κB binding DNA motif of HIV-1-LTR (20Rosen C.A. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Cell. 1985; 41: 813-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) was isolated, end-labeled, and incubated with nuclear proteins of transformed cell lines. The time courses of mobility shift on long term dilute H2O2 treatment (Fig. 3A) and NAC treatment (Fig. 3B) were also examined. Essentially the same results were obtained as with the 42-mer NF-κB DNA binding motif (Fig. 3, cf. Fig. 2). After band shift assay, shifted bands (except supershifted bands) were eluted from the gel and then DNA-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-NF-κB p65 rabbit serum. The recoveries of radioactivity from shifted bands of transformed cells were about 75% or more. These results also strongly suggest that pCD12-transformed cell lines potentially produce an NF-κB-like transcription-activating factor (which could bind to the HIV-LTR region) on long term dilute H2O2 treatment corresponding with the CAT activity. The transformed cells showed a latency for production of CAT activity, but when these cells were maintained in the medium with a low concentration of H2O2, they became potent producers of an NF-κB-like factor, and the HIV-1 promoter was activated by even a moderate concentration of short term H2O2 treatment. Patients infected with HIV-1 show a latency for a long time. The latency for the production of HIV-1 in transformed cell seems to correspond well with the latency of the cells of infected patients (8Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar, 9Hayaishi O. Ueda K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 46: 95-116Crossref Scopus (445) Google Scholar). It is interesting that the activation of transformed cells by treatment with a low concentration of H2O2 for a long time seems to correspond with the activation of the latent HIV-1 virus in patients. Physical movement and normal metabolism should cause various types of oxygen stress in the body (9Hayaishi O. Ueda K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 46: 95-116Crossref Scopus (445) Google Scholar). As in transformed cells, this oxygen stress over a long period may result in activation of the latent virus by NF-κB. Therefore, the present cell system may be a useful model of HIV-1 virus activation and production of AIDS. We thank Drs. F. Wong-Staal and T. Okamoto for gifts of plasmid pCD12."

A central region of enhancer 1, the enhancer core domain, contains at least four cis-acting sequence motifs that are essential for enhancer 1 activity. In this study, we have investigated an essential motif within the core domain previously defined as footprint V (FPV). Transient transfection analyses demonstrate that FPV is capable of independently functioning in a liver-specific manner to activate transcription. Therefore, to further examine the liver-specific properties of FPV-mediated enhancer 1 activity, we have carried out the biochemical purification and characterization of FPV binding activity from rat liver nuclei. This study has conclusively identified hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β (HNF-3β), a liver-enriched member of the HNF-3/forkhead gene family, as the predominant purified protein that interacts with the FPV motif. Moreover, a cellular protein(s) that copurified with HNF-3β specifically interacts with a novel sequence motif that partially overlaps FPV. Since this novel motif contains a palindromic sequence, we have tentatively referred to the protein(s) that binds to this site as palindrome-binding factor (PBF). Additional evidence indicates that HNF-3β and PBF cooperatively interact with enhancer 1.

The majority of individuals that are chronically infected with HBV ultimately experience severe liver disease (1Degroote J. Fevery J. Lepoutre L. Gut. 1979; 19: 510-513Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and are at high risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (2Szmuness W. Prog. Med.

To investigate the regulatory mechanisms that contribute to the hepatotropic nature of this virus, a considerable amount of work has focused on liver-specific aspects of HBV gene expression (for recent reviews, see Refs. 4Yen T.S.B. Semin. Virol. 1993; 4 (references therein): 33-42,Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar and 5Kosovsky M.J. Qadri I. Siddiqui A. Koshy R. Caselmann W.H. Hepatitis B Virus: Molecular Mechanisms in Disease and Novel Strategies for Therapy. Imperial College Press, London1996Google Scholar). The HBV genome is a partially double-stranded circular DNA molecule that is composed of ~3200 base pairs (Fig. 1A). The compact nature of this small genome necessitates an extensively overlapping arrangement of the genetic information. Therefore, it is likely that a number of complex mechanisms regulate the temporal and differential expression of the viral RNAs. This regulation is mediated by the HBV promoter and enhancer elements (see Fig. 1A), which have been shown to exhibit liver-specific properties (4Yen T.S.B. Semin. Virol. 1993; 4 (references therein): 33-42,Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 5Kosovsky M.J. Qadri I. Siddiqui A. Koshy R. Caselmann W.H.

Furthermore, a recent analysis of transgenic mice has provided in vivo evidence suggesting that the liver-specific activity of the core/pregenomic promoter is dependent upon the combined activities of enhancers 1 and 2 (22Billet O.

Molecular Biology of the Hepatitis B Virus. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL, and references therein1991: 193Google Scholar). The activities attributed to enhancer 1 in a broad spectrum of cell types are most likely facilitated by a complex array of liver-enriched as well as ubiquitous trans-acting cellular factors that are capable of specifically interacting with enhancer 1 (see Fig. 1B and Refs. 4Yen T.S.B.

Although ubiquitous factors may activate enhancer 1 in non-hepatocytes, the activity of enhancer 1 within the HBV-infected liver is likely to be dependent upon cooperative interactions between multiple liver-enriched and ubiquitous factors (27Dikstein R.

The functional activity attributed to each motif correlates with the binding activity of a sequence-specific trans-acting cellular factor(s), which include NF-1 (at FPIV), members of the nuclear receptor family (at the RARE), and EF-C/RFX-1 (at FPIII). While the factor(s) that interacts with the FPV sequence motif was previously designated as the hepatitis B liver factor (31Trujillo M.A. Letovsky J. Maguire H.F. Lopez-Cabrera M. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3797-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), recent studies have suggested that one or more of the three known isoforms of hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF-3α, -β, and/or -γ) interact with FPV (36Chen M.

The HNF-3 isoforms are liver-enriched members of the HNF-3/forkhead gene family (41Lai E. Clark K.L. Burley S.K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, we have further investigated the biochemical and functional properties of the FPV sequence motif. Transient transfection studies indicate that the FPV motif independently functions in a liver-specific manner to activate transcription. To identify the liver-enriched factor(s) that interacts with the FPV motif, we have biochemically purified FPV binding activity from rat liver nuclei using three cycles of oligonucleotide affinity chromatography. Our analyses have indicated that the β-isoform of HNF-3 preferentially interacts with the FPV motif, while the previously implicated α- and γ-isoforms (36Chen M. Hieng S. Qian X. Costa R. Ou J.-H. Virology. 1994; 205: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 37Ori A. Shaul Y. Virology. 1995; 207: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) do not associate with the FPV oligonucleotide affinity matrix in the context of a complex mixture of rat liver nuclear proteins. Furthermore, an additional cellular factor(s) that copurified with HNF-3β, which has been tentatively designated as palindrome-binding factor (PBF), has been shown to interact with enhancer 1 at a novel site that partially overlaps the NF-1- and HNF-3β-binding sites. This work also provides evidence supporting the conclusion that HNF-3β and PBF cooperatively interact with enhancer 1. The following oligonucleotides were utilized throughout this study: (i) V (wild-type), which spans the FPV sequence motif (nucleotides 1124-1139) within enhancer 1, 5′-GATCCGGCCTTTCTAAGTAAACAGTACATGAA-3′; (ii) V′ (point mutant), which contains the identical point mutations in the FPV motif previously used for functional analyses of enhancer 1 (34Huan B. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9059-9063Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), 5′-GATCCGGCCTTTCTAAcgAAACAtcACATGAA-3′ (point mutations are shown in lower-case letters); (iii) NS (nonspecific competitor), 5′-GATCCGTCAAAGAATTGGTCTTTG-3′; and (iv) TTR, which spans the HNF-3-binding site within the transthyretin promoter (45Costa R.H. Grayson D.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1415-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), 5′-GATCGTTGACTAAGTCAATAATCAGAATCAG-3′. The wild-type (V) and mutant (V′) oligonucleotides described above were used to generate clones containing multimerized binding sites. Double-stranded V and V′ were independently multimerized in the presence of DNA ligase. Multimers containing three and four copies were isolated and cloned into pGEM-3 to generate pGFPV3 (wild-type) and pGFPV4′ (point mutant), respectively. DNA sequencing (Sequenase 1.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was performed to confirm the orientation and copy number of the multimerized region. A DNA fragment containing the SV40 early promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase gene was excised from plasmid pSLuc2 (46Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned into pGFPV3 and pGFPV4′ to generate the reporter plasmids pFPV3Luc (wild-type) and pFPV4′Luc (point mutant), respectively. Plasmid pENSLuc contains the wild-type enhancer 1 (nucleotides 966-1308, HBV subtype adw2) located upstream of the SV40 early promoter (SV40Ep) and the luciferase reporter gene (34Huan B. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9059-9063Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Plasmids pSLuc2 and pSV2Luc (47de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2463) Google Scholar) contain SV40Ep (enhancerless) and SV40Ep/enhancer located upstream of the luciferase gene, respectively. Transient transfection assays were performed using the human hepatoma cell line Huh-7 (48Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Miyano K. Yamane T. Sato J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar) and the human dedifferentiated liver cell line SK-Hep-1 (49Fogh J. Trempe G. Fogh J. Human Tumor Cells in Vitro. Plenum Press, New York1975: 115Crossref Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of ~5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin (75 units/ml)/streptomycin (50 units/ml) at 37°C. Cell monolayers (~50% confluent) were transfected with 2 µg of a relevant luciferase reporter plasmid and 1 µg of a β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pCH10) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Four hours post-transfection, the plates were furnished with 2 ml of fresh medium. The cells were further incubated for 40 h, harvested, and then analyzed for luciferase (47de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2463) Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) expression. Enhancer 1 binding activity was monitored throughout the purification procedure using the DNase I footprinting assay that is described below. Fresh livers were excised from female rats (Sprague-Dawley) and immediately placed in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5) on ice. The isolation of rat liver nuclei and the subsequent preparation of nuclear extract were carried out as described previously (51Graves B.J. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Cell. 1986; 44: 565-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The remaining steps of the purification were conducted at 4°C. Unless stated otherwise, all column chromatography was performed using the Pharmacia FPLC system. Prior to column chromatography, samples were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Rat liver nuclear extract (Fraction I) was fractionated by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. The protein fraction containing FPV binding activity (0-50% saturated (NH4)2SO4; Fraction II) was then desalted by gravity flow using an Econo-Pac 10DG column (Bio-Rad) that was initially equilibrated with buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10% glycerol, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µM leupeptin, and 1 µM pepstatin). Fraction II was then applied at 18 ml/h to a 15-ml heparin-Sepharose column that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µM leupeptin, and 1 µM pepstatin) containing 0.2 M KCl. The column was washed with 25 ml of buffer B containing 0.2 M KCl, and protein fractions were then eluted with a 60-ml linear gradient of 0.2-0.6 M KCl in buffer B. Heparin-Sepharose fractions that exhibited FPV binding activity were pooled (Fraction III) and then dialyzed against buffer A containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Wild-type and mutant oligonucleotide affinity columns were prepared as described previously (52Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides V and V′, respectively. Ligated oligonucleotides (~10 copies of V or V′/ligated DNA strand) were covalently attached to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with a coupling efficiency of ~85%, which resulted in the coupling of ~100 µg of DNA/ml of resin. The wild-type and mutant affinity resins (1 ml) were packed into separate columns (HR 5/5, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and stored with a solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.3 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3. Prior to affinity chromatography, columns were equilibrated with buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 1 µM leupeptin) containing 0.1 M KCl. Fraction III was mixed with 10 µg/ml nonspecific competitor DNA (poly[d(I·C)], Boehringer Mannheim) and incubated for 10 min on ice. The sample was then clarified as described above and applied to the wild-type affinity column (DNA affinityI) at 9 ml/h. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer C containing 0.1 M KCl, and protein fractions were then eluted with a 9-ml step gradient of 0.2-1.0 M KCl in buffer C. Fractions containing FPV binding activity were pooled (Fraction IV) and then dialyzed against buffer C containing 0.1 M KCl. The remaining affinity chromatography steps were carried out in the absence of poly[d(I·C)]. Fraction IV was clarified and then applied to the mutant affinity column (DNA affinityII) as described above. Fractions containing PBF binding activity were pooled and then dialyzed against buffer D (25 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 M KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 25% glycerol, and 1 µM leupeptin). Fractions containing FPV binding activity were pooled (Fraction V) and directly applied to the wild-type affinity column (DNA affinityIII) as described above. Protein fractions eluted from DNA affinityIII that exhibited FPV binding activity were pooled (Fraction VI) and then dialyzed against buffer D. Purified fractions were analyzed for protein content according to the method of Bradford (53Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (210741) Google Scholar) using γ-globulins as protein standards. Samples utilized for protein-DNA interaction assays and immunoblot analyses were supplemented with carrier protein (bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml). Protein samples were rapidly frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath prior to storage at -80°C. The DNase I footprinting assay was carried out essentially as described (54Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar) in the presence of a DNA fragment spanning nucleotides 1074-1308 on the HBV genome (enhancer 1 probe). The enhancer 1 probe was end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol; ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), ethanol-precipitated, purified from a 5% polyacylamide gel, and then utilized for DNase I footprinting analyses (25,000 cpm/reaction). DNase I digestion products were analyzed on 8 M urea, 8% polyacylamide gels. Following electrophoresis (2 h at 1500 V), which was carried out in 1 × TBE buffer (90 mM Tris base, 64.6 mM boric acid, and 2.5 mM EDTA (pH 8.3)), gels were dried and then exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat AR) for 24-48 h at -80°C. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed with the enhancer 1 probe described above. Fraction VI (~0.34 ng of protein/sample) was preincubated in EMSA reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 16.7 µg/ml poly[d(I·C)], 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 1 µM leupeptin) for 10 min on ice. The samples were then supplemented with the enhancer 1 probe (8000 cpm) and incubated for an additional 20 min on ice. Samples analyzed in the presence of unlabeled competitor DNA (5-125-fold molar excess of competitor DNA relative to the pro"

DNA sequences in the vicinity of the human metallothionein IIA (hMTIIA) gene transcription start site share homology with some of the previously identified Inr elements. However, in the present study we have found by in vitro transcription assays that the hMTIIA promoter does not contain a typical Inr. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified several DNA-protein complexes at the hMTIIA gene transcription start site. A partially purified protein fraction containing replication protein A (RPA) binds to the hMTIIA gene transcription start site and represses transcription from the hMTIIA promoter in vitro. In addition, overexpression of the human 70-kDa RPA-1 protein represses transcription of a reporter gene controlled by the hMTIIA promoter in vivo. These findings suggest that hMTIIA transcription initiation is controlled by a mechanism different from most mammalian and viral promoters and that the previously identified RPA may also be involved in transcription regulation.

Analysis of a large number of mammalian gene promoters revealed the existence of a conserved 5′-TATA-3′ sequence centered at around −30 (relative to the start of initiation) and a conserved 5′-CA-3′ sequence with A at +1 (1Bucher P. Trifonov E.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 10009-10026Google Scholar). The TATA element binds TFIID and directs RNA polymerase and other required basal initiation factors to assemble a stable preinitiation complex. The importance of a TATA element was demonstrated in studies where deletion of this element from a promoter resulted in spurious initiation and a low level of transcription (reviewed in Refs. 2Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Google Scholar and 3Myers R.M. Tilly K. Maniatis T. Science. 1986; 232: 613-618Google Scholar). However, not all eukaryotic genes contain a TATA consensus sequence upstream of their transcription initiation. Promoter studies of some of these TATA-less genes suggest that transcription initiation relies heavily on sequences surrounding the start site called initiator (Inr) 1The abbreviations used are: InrinitiatorRPAreplication protein AhMTIIAhuman metallothionein IIAEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayDTTdithiothreitolFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyCATchloramphenicol acetyl transferase. elements (4Beaupain D.

In one study, a 17-base pair element surrounding the transcription start site of the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase gene was sufficient for accurate basal transcription of this gene both in vitro and in vivo. In the presence of either a TATA box or the SV40 21-base pair repeats, a greatly increased level of transcription initiates specifically from this element (7Smale S.T. Baltimore D.

Inr elements can be divided into many categories. Although they were first discovered in TATA-less promoters, many TATA-containing promoters also possess Inr elements (7Smale S.T. Baltimore D.

Some Inrs are weakly bound by a general transcription factor such as TFII-I, RNA polymerase II, or TFIID, but they appear to lack recognition sites for specific DNA binding proteins (9Carcamo J. Buckbinder L. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8052-8056Google Scholar, 11Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Google Scholar, 13Kaufmann J. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 821-829Google Scholar), whereas others contain high affinity recognition sites for specific DNA-binding proteins (6Means A.L. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell.

There are many definitions for an Inr in the current literature. The original definition for an Inr was a discrete promoter element that can act alone or in concert with either a TATA box or upstream element to direct specific transcription initiation (7Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Google Scholar). Later, the term Inr was restricted to the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase Inr and elements that have sequence homology to the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase Inr (10O'Shea-Greenfield A. Smale S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1391-1402Google Scholar). At another extreme, the Inr has been used to describe any promoter element that determines the transcription start site (17Nakatani Y. Brenner M. Freese E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4289-4293Google Scholar). More recently, Inr elements have been defined as elements that can localize a transcription start site and mediate the action of at least some upstream activators in the absence of a TATA box (18Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Google Scholar). Whatever the definition, Inr elements are widespread in mammalian and viral promoters. In one study, O'Shea-Greenfield and Smale (10O'Shea-Greenfield A. Smale S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1391-1402Google Scholar) inserted start site regions from eight different promoters downstream of the SV40 21-base pair repeats and found that all except the HIV-1 promoter exhibited Inr activity. Subsequently, it was shown that the HIV-1 core promoter lacks a simple Inr element but contains a bipartite activator at the transcription start site (19Zenzie-Gregory B. Sheridan P. Jones K.A. Smale S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15823-15832Google Scholar). The important conclusion is that start site region from many but not all mammalian and viral genes contain Inr activity. In fact, before the discovery of Inr elements, it was found that many DNA elements surrounding the start site of transcription can activate transcription (for examples see Refs. 20Ayer D.E.

Given the apparent importance of Inr elements and the wide distribution of them in many mammalian and viral gene promoters, there is a definite need to understand the mechanism by which they function and how they may regulate transcription. We have previously shown that the adeno-associated virus P5 promoter initiation region binds the transcription factor YY1 (12Seto E. Shi Y. Shenk T. Nature. 1991; 354: 241-245Google Scholar, 30Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.-S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Google Scholar). We have also found that this initiation sequence shares homology with the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase Inr and is important for accurate basal transcription. Further, partially purified YY1 can restore basal level transcription from a P5 Inr in a HeLa extract depleted of YY1 or a Drosophila embryo extract devoid of YY1 activity, whereas a YY1-specific antibody can block the reactivation. This was one of the first studies to identify a cellular factor that can mediate transcription through an Inr element and place the P5 Inr in the distinct class of Inrs that bind a sequence-specific protein. Interestingly, a computer alignment of eukaryotic promoter initiation sequences (at the +1 nucleotide) revealed that the sequence immediately surrounding the human metallothionein IIA (hMTIIA) gene transcription start site exhibits homology to the P5 Inr (P5, 5′-GGTCTCCATTTTG-3′; hMTIIA, GCACTCCACCACG). This hMTIIA transcription start site is identical to a sequence found in a fish Xiphophorus maculatus promoter (31Friedenreich H. Schartl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3299-3305Google Scholar) and the promoter of the human α-2 macroglobulin gene (32Matthijs G. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. Marynen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 65-72Google Scholar). It also shares over 80% identity with a sequence located in the human androgen receptor promoter (33Tilley W.D. Marcelli M. McPhaul M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13776-13781Google Scholar). It has not yet been established whether sequences in these other promoters are part of a transcription start site or whether they play an essential role in transcription. Nevertheless, this high conservation of DNA sequences suggests that the hMTIIA transcription start site may be important for accurate regulation of transcription of the hMTIIA and other genes and thus may represent an individual recognition site for a component of the transcriptional machinery. In fact, it has been suggested that a specific protein may bind to this site in the hMTIIA promoter (34Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Google Scholar, 35Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Google Scholar). In addition to the fact that the hMTIIA transcription start site contain DNA sequences similar to other Inrs, we were interested in examining the hMTIIA gene transcription start site for other reasons. The hMTIIA gene is a good example of the complexity of protein-DNA interactions that can occur at a single promoter to influence the transcription of a gene. Although extensive analysis of the 5′-flanking regions of this promoter revealed a variety of trans-acting factors that bind to different upstream cis-acting sites (34Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Google Scholar, 35Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Google Scholar, 36Lee W. Haslinger A.

Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Google Scholar), the role of the initiation region in basal transcription regulation is not known. A detailed study of the importance of the hMTIIA initiation site alone and characterization of possible factors that may interact with this region has not yet been done. In spite of the homology to known Inrs in other mammalian and viral gene transcription start sites, we demonstrate in these studies that the hMTIIA transcription start site lacks a functional Inr element. More interestingly, we have demonstrated that several proteins bind to this transcription start site and repress transcription. One of these proteins has been identified as the human replication protein A (RPA), originally found as a multisubunit protein being absolutely required for SV40 DNA replication (39Fairman M.P. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1211-1218Google Scholar, 40Wobbe C.R. Weissbach L. Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Murakami Y. Bullock P. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Shi Y. Shenk T. Nature. 1991; 354: 241-245Google Scholar). phMTIIA+1, pMLTATA/hMTIIA+1, and pSp1/hMTIIA+1 were constructed as described for TdT and P5 plasmids used in similar studies (7Smale S.T.

Heyer W.-D. Kolodner R. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12090-12098Google Scholar) in the vector pcDNAI/Amp (Invitrogen) such that the CMV promoter would express sense RPA-1 RNA, whereas pCMV-RPA(−) contains the RPA-1 gene in the opposite orientation. Plasmid p4′5CAT contains the hMTIIA promoter sequence (49Karin M. Richards R.I. Nature. 1982; 299: 797-802Google Scholar) from −286 to +73 linked to the CAT reporter gene. Plasmid pRSV-βgal that carries the β-galactosidase gene downstream from the long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus has been described (50Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Google Scholar). To construct pG4-RPA(+), the 70-kDa RPA-1 cDNA was subcloned into plasmid pSG424 (51Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Google Scholar) downstream and in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Plasmid pG4-RPA(−) was constructed identically but with the RPA-1 cDNA in the opposite orientation such that it would express the Gal4 DNA-binding domain alone. Reporter plasmids pGal4TKCAT (30Shi Y.

All plasmid constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (55Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies that recognize different RPA subunits have been described (56Kenny M.K. Schlegel U. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7693-7700Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody to transcription factor Sp1 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All antibodies were purified by protein A-Sepharose chromatography, concentrated with ammonium sulfate, and dialyzed with 50 m Tris, pH 8, 150 m KCl, and 0.02% NaN3. HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (57Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). Each reaction (in a 25-µl total volume) contained 500 ng of DNA template, 10 m MgCl2, 40 ng of poly(dG-dC), 2.4 m HEPES, pH 7.9, 2.4% (v/v) glycerol, 12 m KCl, 0.024 m EDTA, 0.06 m DTT, 0.5 m ATP, 0.5 m GTP, 0.5 m CTP, 0.5 m UTP, 1 m creatine phosphate, and approximately 60-80 µg of HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30°C and terminated by the addition of 225 µl of stop buffer (1% SDS, 10 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 m EDTA, pH 8.0, and 5 µg/ml yeast tRNA). Following phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, template DNAs were degraded with 5 units of RNase-free DNase (Promega) for 1 h at 37°C. In some reactions, different amounts of an oligodeoxynucleotides were added to the mixture prior to the addition of ribonucleotides. The RNA products were analyzed by primer extension (58McKnight S.L. Kingsbury R. Science. 1982; 217: 316-324Google Scholar). Briefly, after ethanol precipitation, RNA pellets were resuspended in 15 µl of RNase-free buffer containing 150 m KCl, 10 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 m EDTA, and radiolabeled oligodeoxynucleotide primer. RNA and primers were hybridized by incubation for 90 min at 60°C and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. For extension reactions, 30 µl of reaction mixture (30 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 15 m MgCl2, 8.3 m DTT, 0.225 mg/ml actinomycin D, 0.22 m of dNTPs, and 0.66 units/µl avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase) were added to each sample and incubated for 1 h at 42°C. 32P-Labeled extension products were extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in formamide loading dye, and separated on 8% sequencing gels. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Single-stranded oligodeoxnucleotides were labeled individually with [γ32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, heated together at 65°C, and allowed to anneal by slow cooling to room temperature. Each reaction contained 20 fmol of labeled DNA, 12 m HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 5 m MgCl2, 60 m KCl, 1 m DTT, 50 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 m EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 or 1 µg of poly(dI-dC), and approximately 7 µg of HeLa cell extract or approximately 0.4 µg of purified protein in a 12-µl total volume. Unlabeled specific and nonspecific competitors or antibodies were included in some reactions. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, separated on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (0.0225 Tris borate, and 0.0005 EDTA), dried, and subjected to autoradiography. A nuclear extract was prepared from 100 liters of HeLa cells by the method of Dignam et al. (57Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). This extract (185 ml, 2.3 g) was dialyzed against buffer A (20 m HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 50 m KCl, 0.2 m EDTA, 0.5 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 m DTT) and then applied to a 2.6 × 40-cm P11 phosphocellulose column. After washing with buffer A, bound proteins were eluted with a 1.5-liter gradient from 0.05 to 1 KCl in buffer A. Protein-DNA complexes were detected by EMSA described above. Proteins forming complexes I and III eluted at about 250 m KCl. These fractions were pooled (100 ml, 190 mg), dialyzed against buffer B (50 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 50 m KCl, 1 m EDTA, 1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 m benzamidine, and 0.5 m DTT), and then applied to a 1.6 × 20-cm DEAE-Sephacel column. Bound proteins were eluted with a 400-ml gradient from 0.05 to 1 KCl in buffer B. Proteins forming complex III (34 ml, 21 mg) eluted at 250 m KCl were partially resolved from those forming complex I. After dialysis against buffer B, the sample was applied to an FPLC HR5/5 Mono Q column, and bound proteins were eluted with a 20 ml gradient from 0.05 to 0.75 KCl in buffer B. Proteins forming complex III (8 ml, 14 mg) eluted at 350 m KCl were resolved from those forming complex I. This fraction was then separated by gel filtration through a 1.6 × 60-cm Superdex 200 column (two identical fractions of 4-ml samples) that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.25 KCl. Active fractions (26 ml, 2 mg) were dialyzed against Buffer C (50 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m EDTA, 0.5 m DTT, and 1 ammonium sulfate) and then applied to an FPLC HR 5/5 phenyl superose column. Bound proteins were eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from 1 to 0 ammonium sulfate in buffer C. Active fractions (10 ml, 200 µg) that eluted at about 0.3 ammonium sulfate were dialyzed against buffer B and then fractionated by FPLC Mono Q chromatography as described above. The most highly purified fractions that formed complex III were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Centricon-10 filter (Amicon) as described by the manufacturer. Polypeptides were separated by electrophoresis through a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Polypeptides on the membranes were visualized by staining with 0.1% Ponceau S in 5% acetic acid. After destaining with 5% acetic acid, the appropriate strips of membrane were excised, washed with H20, and stored at −20°C prior to in situ digestion with trypsin (59Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Google Scholar). The resulting peptide mixture was separated by narrow bore high performance liquid chromatography using a Vydac C18 2.1 × 150-mm reverse phase column on a Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC/1040 diode array detector. Optimum fractions from each peptide chromatogram were chosen based on differential UV absorbance at 210, 277, and 292 nm, peak symmetry, and resolution. Peaks were further screened for length and homogeneity by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a Finnigan Lasermat 2000. Selected fractions were submitted to automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 477A or Hewlett Packard G1005 protein sequencer. Details of strategies for the selection of peptide fractions and their microsequencing have been previously described (60Lane W.S. Galat A. Harding M.W. Schreiber S.L. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 151-160Google Scholar). CV1 cells were grown on 60-mm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were done with the calcium phosphate method (61Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1978; 14: 725-731Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed by repeated freeze/thaw cycles, and extracts were assayed for CAT activity as described previously (52Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays were performed using the Galacto-Light kit (Tropix). Previously, using in vitro transcription assays, we and others have demonstrated that many mammalian gene transcription start sites possess Inr activities. Here, we tested the ability of the hMTIIA transcription start site (−7 to +11 [hMTIIA+1]) to direct and activate transcription in the presence or the absence of either the adenovirus major late TATA box (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3) or multiple Sp1 binding sites (Fig. 1, lane 4). Compared with the P5 Inr, the hMTIIA initiation site gave no detectable transcription activity with or without upstream activator binding sites. This is somewhat surprising, given the earlier findings (12Seto E. Shi Y. Shenk T. Nature. 1991; 354: 241-245Google Scholar, 47Smale S.T. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Google Scholar) that a major late TATA box or multiple Sp1 sites alone can confer spurious and low level initiations (although it has been suggested that these low level initiations may be artificial). All transcription reactions were repeated at least three times with consistent results using different nuclear extract and template preparations. Therefore, at least by two definitions (7Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Google Scholar, 18Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Google Scholar), unlike many mammalian and viral promoters, the hMTIIA transcription start site does not possess an Inr. Two models could be invoked to explain our observation of the lack of an hMTIIA Inr activity. First, it is possible that proteins, either a universal Inr-binding protein or others that may augment the strength of an Inr, do not bind the hMTIIA start site. Alternatively, one can imagine that similar to the SV40 major late promoter transcription start site (62Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Zuo F. Murray E.E. Loritz K. Mertz J.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2206-2219Google Scholar), the hMTIIA start site could bind a transcription repressor. Of course, these two models need not be mutually exclusive; it is also possible that the hMTIIA start site binds to a combination of positive and negative factors, and the net result is a lack of Inr activity. Any rigorous test of these models requires the identification of DNA sequence that conveys Inr activity and characterization of proteins that interact with the hMTIIA start site DNA. Five plasmids were constructed to contain DNA sequences mutated to mimic the P5 Inr. These plasmids were derived from pMLTATA/hMTIIA+1 (Fig. 1, lane 3, and Fig. 2A, lane 8), which contains the adenovirus major late TATA box upstream of the hMTIIA+1. In vitro transcription assays were performed, and the results are displayed in Fig. 2A. We found that mutations of the hMTIIA start site at nucleotides +2 and +3 (from CC to TT) imparted Inr activity. This is consistent with previous findings that the sequence requirement for Inr activity resides primarily between −1 and +3 with CATT being a much stronger Inr than CACC (18Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Google Scholar). If the lack of hMTIIA Inr activity is a result of a repressor acting on the hMTIIA+1, then one would predict that only hMTIIA+1mt2 would have lost its ability to bind this putative repressor. In contrast, if the lack of hMTIIA Inr activity is a result of the absence of an activator, then one would have to predict that hMTIIA+1mt2 and no other mutants gained the ability to bind this putative activator. We reasoned that if the lack of an Inr activity from the hMTIIA+1 is due to the binding of a repressor, then the addition of DNA containing the hMTIIA+1 sequences into the in vitro transcription mixture should titrate out the repressor binding activity and restore transcription. In contrast, if the lack of an Inr activity from the hMTIIA start site is due to the lack of binding of an Inr activator, then the addition of DNA containing the hMTIIA start site sequences into the in vitro transcription reactions should have no effect on transcription activity. As shown in Fig. 2B, oligodeoxynucleotide containing hMTIIA+1 increased transcription initiation from a pMLTATA/hMTIIA+1 template (compare lane 1 with lanes 2-4). This activation of transcription is highly specific and requires specific hMTIIA+1 sequences, and as a mutated sequence (which presumably can no longer bind the putative repressor) cannot compete with the repression activity (Fig. 2B, lane 5); sequences that cannot restore transcription activity (Fig. 2A, lane 7, which presumably retains binding to the putative repressor) effectively competed with the repression activity (Fig. 2B, lane 6). Furthermore, excess hMTIIA+1 oligodeoxynucleotides have no effect on transcription of the P5 Inr (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 7 and 8)."
https://openalex.org/W2031960519,"Previously, our laboratory has shown that prolactin (PRL) inhibits epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced DNA synthesis. One pathway for the initiation of DNA synthesis is EGF-receptor (EGF-R) signaling through Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). To determine the effects of PRL on EGF-induced MAPK activation and phosphorylation, MAPK or phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) was immunoprecipitated from normal murine mammary epithelial (NMuMG) cells treated with PRL (100 ng/ml) and/or EGF (10 ng/ml) for 10-min periods. EGF-induced phosphorylation and activation were then examined by Western analysis and a myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific kinase assay. The p42 isoform of MAPK showed a distinct decrease in activity and phosphorylation when cells were treated with PRL. Concluding that PRL affects EGF signaling upstream of MAPK, we examined the effect of PRL on EGF-induced Ras activity. NMuMG cells were incubated with [32P]orthophosphoric acid, treated as described above, immunoprecipitated with an antibody specific to Ras, and nucleotides were eluted and separated by TLC. Ras activity as measured by GTP:GDP ratio was increased by EGF, but not by PRL. Additionally, PRL in combination with EGF abolished the ability of EGF to induce Ras activity. Those studies suggest that PRL alters the EGF signaling pathway upstream of Ras. Because Ras activation by EGF involves EGF-stimulated association of EGF-R with Grb2, the EGF-R was immunoprecipitated and a Western blot was probed for Grb2. As expected we found that EGF stimulated an association of EGF-R with Grb2, PRL, however, blocked this association. When we looked at the ability of Shc to associate with the EGF-R, we found that PRL and EGF had little effect on this association. The studies demonstrate that PRL either directly or indirectly inhibits the ability of EGF to induce EGF-R association with Grb2, to activate Ras, and to activate and phosphorylate MAPK.

High affinity EGF receptors have been identified in the mammary gland (Taketani and Oka, 34Taketani Y. Oka T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80 (b): 2647-2650Google Scholar) and shown to be developmentally regulated (Edery et al., 7Edery M. Pang K. Larson L. Colosi T. Nandi S. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 405-411Google Scholar). Current dogma holds that a biological response, such as DNA synthesis, can be traced back to EGF binding to the EGF-R (Gill et al., 14Gill G.N. Santon J.B. Bertics P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. Suppl. 1987; 5: 35-41Google Scholar). One early consequence of EGF binding to its receptor is receptor dimerization and interchain autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues (Yarden and Schlessinger, 40Yarden Y. Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1434-1442Google Scholar). It is believed that Grb2, a SH2 domain protein, binds the phosphorylated receptor and aids in the activation of Sos-1 (Lowenstein et al., 22Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Google Scholar; Egan et al., 8Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinber R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Google Scholar). Sos-1 enhances Ras protein exchange factors converting GDP to the biologically active, GTP-bound Ras (Egan et al., 8Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinber R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Google Scholar). Upon activation, Ras assists Raf-1 localization to the membrane where it initiates a cascade of phosphorylation events including the phosphorylation and activation of the mitogen activating kinase kinase (MEK) and the mitogen activating protein kinase (MAPK) (Stokoe et al., 32Stokoe D. MacDonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1466Google Scholar; Gardner et al., 13Gardner A.M. Vaillancourt R.R. Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 193-201Google Scholar). Recently another SH2 domain protein has been shown to associate with the EGF-R. This protein, Shc, is tyrosine phosphorylated when bound to the EGF-R via a tyrosine phosphorylation site and SH2 domain interaction (Ruff-Jamison et al., 31Ruff-Jamison S. McGlade J. Pawson T. Chen K. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7610-7612Google Scholar). Shc then has the ability to associate with Grb2 through another tyrosine phosphorylation-SH2 interaction, eventually leading to Ras activation and mitogenesis (Pelicci et al., 29Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Google Scholar; Rozakis-Adcock et al., 30Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Google Scholar). The exact binding mechanism of Shc to the EGF-R has recently been under debate. One group found a phosphotyrosine recognition domain named phosphotyrosine binding domain on the Shc protein (Kavanaugh et al., 18Kavanaugh W.M. Turck C.W. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 1177-1179Google Scholar) which also has the ability to associate with the autophosphorylated EGF-R (van der Geer et al., 38van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Lai V.K.-M. Stephens R. White M.F. Kaplan D. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 963-968Google Scholar). It has also been discovered that a mutated EGF-R in the autophosphorylation site still retains the ability to bind tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc, again leading to Ras activation (Li et al., 21Li N. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3457-3465Google Scholar). Therefore, the functional interaction of Shc and the EGF-R has yet to be fully characterized. Although EGF and other growth factors signal through a variety of pathways, the Ras/MAPK cascade has been heavily investigated. MAPKs are a family of highly conserved serine/threonine kinases that are activated by phosphorylation on both tyrosine and threonine, mediated by MEK (Boulton et al., 2Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenhesser S.D. DePinto R.A. Panaytos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopaulos G.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 663-675Google Scholar; Crews et al., 6Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Cell Growth Diff. 1992; 3: 135-142Google Scholar). MAPK phosphorylation and activation has been shown to correlate with a variety of events, including cell proliferation and differentiation (reviewed in Crews et al. (6Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Cell Growth Diff. 1992; 3: 135-142Google Scholar)). In some cell lines, MAPK activation appears to be required for mitogenesis (Pages et al., 28Pagès G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.-C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Google Scholar), but this may not be universal. Constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway (via expression of a constitutively active MEK) has been shown to induce tumorigenic transformation (Mansour et al., 23Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. VandeWoude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Google Scholar). However, in other cell lines, MAPK activation is not associated with increased growth, but with cell differentiation (Traverse et al., 36Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem J. 1992; 288: 351-355Google Scholar). There is some suggestion (from PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells) that these differential activities of MAPK may be due to temporal differences in the length of time MAPK remains active (Traverse et al., 36Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem J. 1992; 288: 351-355Google Scholar). Whether this represents a general mechanism is unclear. Previous research (Fenton and Sheffield, 11Fenton S.E. Sheffield L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 773-780Google Scholar) suggested that PRL modulation of EGF induced DNA synthesis is due to altered EGF-R function, including decreased receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. If correct, this model would imply that PRL decreases EGF induced signaling events, such as receptor-Grb2 association, Ras activation, and MAPK activation. Therefore, the objective of this project was to evaluate the effects of PRL on EGF-R mediated signaling events. NMuMG (Owens, 27Owens R.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1974; 52: 13750-13758Google Scholar) mammary epithelial cells from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) were maintained in culture conditions of 100% humidity at 37°C with an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) on Falcon and Corning plates and flasks (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ, and Corning, NY, respectively). NMuMG cells were plated on 100-mm plates (10-20 million cells/plate) and allowed to grow for 24 h. Cells were then serum starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 18 h prior to treatment. For the anti-Ras immunoprecipitation 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with ∼10 µ phosphate and 0.2 mCi of [32P]orthophosphoric acid was added to each treatment plate for 4 h at 37°C prior to treatment application. Treatments of 100 ng/ml PRL, 10 ng/ml EGF, 100 ng/ml PRL, and 10 ng/ml EGF, or consecutive treatments of 100 ng/ml PRL then 10 ng/ml EGF were added for 10 min for the anti-Ras immunoprecipitation and for 5 min for the anti-EGF-R immunoprecipitation. (For the cells that were pretreated with PRL, they were treated for 10 min before the EGF was added for the anti-Ras immunoprecipitation and 5 min before the EGF was added for the anti-EGF-R immunoprecipitation.) Each plate was washed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or Hanks' balanced salt solution. Samples were then lysed with 500 µl of extraction buffer (50 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 m MgCl2, 150 m NaCl, 5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) or 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 5 m EDTA, 30 m sodium pyrophosphate, 50 µ sodium fluoride, 100 µ sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% sodium azide, and 1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), for anti-Ras immunoprecipitations or anti-EGF-R, anti-MAPK, and anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitations, respectively. The lysates were then incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C to clear samples. The supernatants were then incubated with 5 µg of anti-Ras polyclonal antibody (UBI, Lake Placid, NY) plus 25 µl of agarose-conjugated protein A (Oncogene Science, Uniondale, NY) for 30 min, with 4 µg of anti-EGF-R sheep polyclonal antibody (UBI) plus 25 µl of agarose-conjugated protein G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h, with 5 µg of anti-p42MAPK (UBI) plus 25 µl of agarose-conjugated protein A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h, or with agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine (Oncogene Science) for 2 h. Agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 3 min, washed 3 times with lysis buffer, and the pellets were resuspended in 100 µl of SDS loading dye (Laemmli, 19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) or 20 µl of 1 KH2PO4, pH 3.3, for the anti-EGF-R and anti-MAPK or anti-Ras immunoprecipitates, respectively. The anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitation required an elution step with incubation of the pellet in 1 m p-nitrophenyl phosphate in lysis buffer for 1 h and 100 µl of the supernatant was added to 100 µl of SDS loading dye. Samples from the immunoprecipitations were separated by 14, 12, or 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Laemmli, 19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as described by Towbin et al. (35Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) at 150 volts for 1 h at 4°C. Membranes were blocked in PBS and 3% Tween 20 (PBS-T) supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4°C. The membranes were then probed with 1 µg/ml anti-Ash/Grb2 monoclonal antibody (UBI), 0.2 µg/ml anti-Shc polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 0.5 µg/ml anti-human EGF-R sheep polyclonal antibody (UBI), 5 µg/ml anti-MAPK (UBI; recognizing 42- and 44-kDa forms), 5 µg/ml anti-Erk2 (42 kDa specific; UBI), 10 µg/ml anti-phosphothreonine (Sigma), or 100 µg/ml anti-phosphotryosine monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Science) in PBS-T containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed 6 times for 5 min each, with PBS-T containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The secondary antibody for all but the EGF-R and Shc antibodies was anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:1000. For the EGF-R antibody an anti-sheep IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) and for the Shc antibody an anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) were used at the same dilution as above. The membranes were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature and washed again as above. The proteins were then detected using enhanced chemiluminescence as described by the manufacturer (DuPont, Boston, MA). For determination of MAPK activity, p42MAPK immunoprecipitates were suspended in 30 µl of assay buffer (50 m Tris, pH 7.2, 10 m MgCl2, 1 m sodium orthovanadate). To this suspension, 10 µl of myelin basic protein (1 mg/ml) was added and reactions started by adding [γ-32P]ATP (10 µl of a 500 µ solution containing 10 µCi of 32P). Reactions were continued for 5 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 50 µl of SDS loading buffer and heating samples in boiling water for 5 min. Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE, gels dried, and autoradiography performed using calcium tungstate intensifying screens and pre-flashed Fuji x-ray film. The Collage™ image analysis system (Fotodyne, New Berlin, WI) was used to determine relative densities of the myelin basic protein bands. Samples from anti-Ras immunoprecipitates were analyzed using thin layer chromatography (TLC). PEI-cellulose-F glass plates (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) were spotted with 10 µl of each sample and 10 µl of GTP and GDP standards (Sigma). The TLC was developed with 1 KH2PO4, pH 4.5. The plates were dried and exposed to x-ray film. The film was then developed and analyzed using a computer aided densitometry program (Collage™). Densities were corrected for different specific activities of GTP and GDP, and reported as ratio of GTP:GDP. All experiments were replicated at least three times. Quantitative data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. Means were compared by planned comparisons as described under “Results” (Gill, 15Gill J.L. Design and Analysis of Experiments in the Animal and Medial Sciences. Iowa State University Press, Ames IA1978Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, significance level was at least p < 0.05 for all comparisons deemed significant. Preliminary time course studies indicated that EGF elevates MAPK phosphorylation at a maximum level between 5 and 10 min (data not shown). Therefore 10 min was chosen as a time point in the following MAPK studies. Immunoprecipitates of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins probed with anti-MAPK (Fig. 1) indicated that EGF increased phosphorylation of both 42- and 44-kDa forms of MAPK. PRL increased phosphorylation of the 44-kDa form, but not the 42-kDa MAPK. Interestingly, PRL appeared to inhibit the ability of EGF to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the 42-kDa MAPK. In subsequent experiments (Fig. 2), p42MAPK was immunoprecipitated and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine. The results of these studies confirmed the previous results, that EGF increased p42MAPK tyrosine phosphorylation and that PRL blocked this effect. Similar results were also observed for threonine phosphorylation of MAPK.Fig. 2Verification of EGF and PRL effects on p42MAPK tyrosine phosphorylation. The 42-kDa form of MAPK was immunoprecipitated (IP) and Western blots probed with anti-phosphotyrosine (panel A), anti-MAPK (panel B), or anti-phosphothreonine (panel C). C, control; E, EGF, 10 ng/ml for 10 min; P, PRL, 100 ng/ml for 10 min; EP, simultaneous treatment with EGF and PRL; PE, sequential treatment with PRL, then EGF. Representative of three blots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As expected from the MAPK phosphorylation studies, p42MAPK activity was increased 16-fold by EGF treatment (Fig. 3). PRL appeared to give a slight increase in MAPK activity (approximately double control activity), which may be due to either a small PRL activation of p42MAPK or to precipitation of a small amount of p44MAPK along with the p42MAPK. In addition to EGF activation of MAPK, these results also indicated that the PRL antagonism of p42MAPK phosphorylation was reflected in kinase activity of the immunoprecipitated p42MAPK. Simultaneous or sequential addition of PRL and EGF resulted in slightly greater kinase activity than controls, but in both cases the kinase activity was significantly less than that observed with EGF alone. Time course studies were also used in the Ras activity assays to determine the optimal time of EGF induced Ras activation. Treatment for 10 min with EGF appeared to give maximal stimulation of Ras (not shown) and was therefore the time point used in subsequent studies. EGF increased the amount of GTP bound to Ras over 6-fold from untreated cells, as measured by Ras immunoprecipitation from 32P-labeled cells, followed by TLC analysis of GTP:GDP ratios (Fig. 4). PRL alone did not significantly increase the amount of GTP associated with Ras. In addition, PRL inhibited the ability of EGF to increase GTP bound to Ras. Since Ras is active when binding GTP, it follows that EGF stimulates Ras activity while PRL alone and in combination with EGF (simultaneously or sequentially) fail to increase Ras activity. Ras activation is part of a major pathway for cell proliferation in mammary epithelial cells (Mulchahy, 26Mulchahy L.S. Smith M.R. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1985; 313: 241-243Google Scholar). These data suggest that EGF increased stimulation of the Ras pathway, whereas PRL blocks the ability of EGF to activate Ras. Because EGF activation of Ras is thought to occur via EGF induced association of the EGF-R with Grb2, we examined the effect of PRL on EGF-R association with Grb2. Immunoprecipitates of EGF receptor probed with anti-Grb2 indicated that EGF increased Grb2 association with the receptor, and that this association was decreased by PRL treatment (Fig. 5A). These changes did not appear to be associated with changes in the amount of EGF-R immunoprecipitated, but did appear to associate with changes in receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5, B and C). Recently Shc has been shown to be involved with EGF induced signaling. We examined the effect of PRL and EGF in EGF-R association with Shc. Immunoprecipitates of EGF receptor probed with anti-Shc indicate that Shc is associated with the receptor constitutively and that neither EGF nor PRL affected this association in any reproducible manner (Fig. 6). Since Shc itself is tyrosine phosphorylated, we also looked at the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc with EGF and PRL stimulation and again observed no distinct change in phosphorylation levels (data not shown). Initial results of these studies indicated that PRL decreased the ability of EGF to phosphorylate and activate p42MAPK (Erk2). These results were anticipated as a previous study (Fenton and Sheffield, 11Fenton S.E. Sheffield L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 773-780Google Scholar) demonstrated that EGF and PRL altered phosphorylation of 40-50-kDa proteins when total phosphorylation was examined. However, the exact identity of the proteins was not established in that study. These results presented here clearly identify the proteins as MAPKs. MAPK phosphorylation and activation have previously been shown to be induced by a variety of growth factor signaling via tyrosine kinase receptors, including EGF (reviewed in Crews et al. (6Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Cell Growth Diff. 1992; 3: 135-142Google Scholar)). In at least some cases, increased MAPK activity appears to be necessary for growth factor-induced mitogenesis (Pages et al., 1993). However, in other cases MAPK activation appears to be associated with cellular differentiation. In PC12 cells, this difference has been attributed to different temporal patterns of MAPK inactivation (Traverse et al., 36Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem J. 1992; 288: 351-355Google Scholar). However, to the best of our knowledge, this hypothesis has not been examined in other model systems. In addition to tyrosine kinase receptors, cytokine receptors, such as those for growth hormone and for PRL, have been shown to increase phosphorylation and activation of MAPKs (Moller et al., 25Möller C. Hansson A. Enberg B. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23403-23408Google Scholar). Interestingly, the present study indicated that, while EGF increased phosphorylation of both 42- and 44-kDa forms of MAPK, PRL alone had no effect on p42MAPK phosphorylation, but increased p44MAPK phosphorylation. The reason for this is unclear, since most studies to date have reported similar patterns of activation of 42- and 44-kDa forms of MAPK. Because Ras activation appears to play a critical role in EGF-induced MAPK activation in systems studied to date, we examined the effects of EGF and PRL on Ras activation. These studies indicated that PRL lacks the ability to stimulate the Ras signaling pathway. Thus, PRL activation of p44MAPK phosphorylation would appear to proceed via a Ras-independent pathway. Recently, Erwin et al. (9Erwin R.A. Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Farrar W.L. Rui H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3512-3518Google Scholar) showed PRL treatment doubled Ras activity when compared to that of the untreated rat T cell lymphoma Nb2 cell line. We also saw this doubling of Ras activity when NMuMG cells were treated with PRL in comparison to untreated cells, but this was not statistically significant in our studies and was substantially smaller than the increase induced by EGF. Previously, PRL receptor has been shown to associate with and activate Raf (Clevenger et al., 5Clevenger C.V. Torigoe T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5559-5565Google Scholar). Whether PRL receptor might associate with other activators of MEK, such as MEKK, is unknown. PRL receptor also associates with members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases (Clevenger and Medaglia, 4Clevenger C.V. Medaglia M.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 674-681Google Scholar). Members of the Src family bind to and activate Raf (Cleghon and Morrison, 3Cleghon V. Morrison D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17749-17755Google Scholar). In addition, PRL has previously been shown to activate protein kinase C (Banerjee and Vonderhaar, 1Banerjee R. Vonderhaar B.K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 90: 61-67Google Scholar; Marte et al., 24Marte B.M. Meyer T. Stabel S. Standke G.J. Jaken S. Fabbro D. Hynes N.E. Cell Growth & Diff. 1994; 5: 239-247Google Scholar), which may in turn activate the MAPK pathway as well as other signaling pathways, such as the JNK pathway (Lebrun et al., 20Lebrun J.-J. Ali S. Sofer L. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14021-14026Google Scholar). EGF stimulation of Ras activity was inhibited by PRL. Since Ras is generally acknowledged to be a critical signaling event in EGF induction of MAPK activity, the PRL antagonism of EGF induced Ras activity would seem to be a likely mechanism by which PRL inhibits EGF signaling. However, these findings do not indicate the exact mechanism by which Ras activation was inhibited by PRL. Because EGF is thought to activate Ras via EGF receptor association with adapter proteins such as Grb2 (Lowenstein et al., 22Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Google Scholar), we examined the association of the EGF-R with Grb2. Results of these studies confirmed that PRL blocked the ability of the EGF-R to associate with Grb2. This process was associated with a decrease in EGF-R tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, these studies support a model in which PRL induces a modification in EGF-R or an early signaling event that leads to reduced EGF-R autophosphorylation. This autophosphorylation reduction leads to a decrease in Grb2 association with the EGF-R, which in turn reduces or eliminates Ras activation and consequent activation of the MAPK pathway. Interestingly, PRL and EGF had little or no effect on EGF-R/Shc association. Together with the data in this paper and previous studies showing that Shc can associate with a mutant EGF-R that is not autophosphorylated (Li et al., 21Li N. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3457-3465Google Scholar) but Shc could not be tyrosine phosphorylated by this mutant (Gotoh et al., 16Gotoh N. Muroya K. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Chida K. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2525-2533Google Scholar) leads us to believe that Shc is not playing a major role in the PRL sensitive EGF signaling pathway we are studying. If Shc is involved it could be activated through PRL since it was found that PRL, via JAK2 activation, has the ability to recruit Shc to the membrane and that the total amount of Shc protein found in the membrane fraction increases with PRL stimulation (Erwin et al., 9Erwin R.A. Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Farrar W.L. Rui H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3512-3518Google Scholar). So perhaps PRL is recruiting Shc to the membrane to be phosphorylated by an undefined kinase, which then allows Shc to associate with the EGF-R. The PRL-induced pathway which alters EGF-R signaling remains unclear. A wide variety of signaling mechanisms have been postulated for PRL, including the JAK-STAT pathway (Lebrun et al.. 1994), Src-related kinases (Clevenger and Medaglia, 4Clevenger C.V. Medaglia M.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 674-681Google Scholar), and activation of protein kinase C (Banerjee and Vonderhaar, 1Banerjee R. Vonderhaar B.K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 90: 61-67Google Scholar; Marte et al., 24Marte B.M. Meyer T. Stabel S. Standke G.J. Jaken S. Fabbro D. Hynes N.E. Cell Growth & Diff. 1994; 5: 239-247Google Scholar). Clearly these pathways are not mutually exclusive, and PRL action may involve a multifaceted signaling system. Previous studies have suggested that protein kinase C phosphorylates the EGF-R and decreases its tyrosine kinase activity (Hunter et al., 17Hunter T. Ling N. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 480-485Google Scholar). Thus, while prolactin modulation of EGF signaling via phosphorylation of the EGF-R appears likely, the exact enzymology of the pathway remains unclear. Studies in our laboratory are now underway to clarify the involvement of PRL-stimulated PKC in down-regulation of EGF-R signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2044243849,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH)-mediated gene activation was assessed in the osteoblast-like rat cell line ROS17/2.8 with two PTH fragments harboring distinct activating domains: PTH-(1-34) and PTH-(28-48). The PTH response of genes expressed immediate early in the cell cycle or in the osteoblast developmental sequence was investigated. In addition, subtractive cloning was used to identify genes in ROS17/2.8 cells that are activated by the two PTH domains. PTH-(1-34) immediately increased the transcript levels of c-fos and c-jun at a considerably higher rate than PTH-(28-48). A significant immediate PTH effect on osteoblastic marker genes could not be detected, with the exception of elevated ornithine decarboxylase transcript levels. However, continuous application of PTH-(1-34) increased transcript levels of the osteoblast-specific osteocalcin gene and reduced those of other osteoblastic marker genes including alkaline phosphatase and the PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor. By subtractive cloning, nine cDNAs were isolated corresponding to mRNAs directly up-regulated by PTH-(1-34) or PTH-(28-48). Among these were a cyclic phosphodiesterase, a (cytosine 5)-methyltransferase, an 80-kDa protein kinase C substrate, junB, and a novel GC-binding protein. Three cDNAs are unknown at present. Interestingly, in all cases, the efficiency of gene activation by PTH-(28-48) was substantially lower in comparison with PTH-(1-34). PTH-mediated protein kinase C signaling in ROS17/2.8 cells may therefore constitute a minor pathway in comparison with the dominant cAMP/protein kinase A cascade. Parathyroid hormone (PTH)-mediated gene activation was assessed in the osteoblast-like rat cell line ROS17/2.8 with two PTH fragments harboring distinct activating domains: PTH-(1-34) and PTH-(28-48). The PTH response of genes expressed immediate early in the cell cycle or in the osteoblast developmental sequence was investigated. In addition, subtractive cloning was used to identify genes in ROS17/2.8 cells that are activated by the two PTH domains. PTH-(1-34) immediately increased the transcript levels of c-fos and c-jun at a considerably higher rate than PTH-(28-48). A significant immediate PTH effect on osteoblastic marker genes could not be detected, with the exception of elevated ornithine decarboxylase transcript levels. However, continuous application of PTH-(1-34) increased transcript levels of the osteoblast-specific osteocalcin gene and reduced those of other osteoblastic marker genes including alkaline phosphatase and the PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor. By subtractive cloning, nine cDNAs were isolated corresponding to mRNAs directly up-regulated by PTH-(1-34) or PTH-(28-48). Among these were a cyclic phosphodiesterase, a (cytosine 5)-methyltransferase, an 80-kDa protein kinase C substrate, junB, and a novel GC-binding protein. Three cDNAs are unknown at present. Interestingly, in all cases, the efficiency of gene activation by PTH-(28-48) was substantially lower in comparison with PTH-(1-34).

Studies on structure-activity relations of PTH have revealed that some of the triggered cellular reactions are related to certain distinct domains on the PTH sequence. The hormone needs the first two N-terminal amino acids and its principal receptor-binding region (at positions 25-34) to stimulate adenylate cyclase (20Jüppner H. Martinez J.

Treatment with the mid-regional fragment PTH-(28-48) causes a cAMP-independent stimulation of DNA synthesis in chicken cartilage cells and rat osteoblasts in vivo and in vitro (23Sümjen D. Binderman I. Schlüter K.-D. Wingender E. Mayer H. Kaye A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Sümjen D. Schlüter K.-D. Wingender E. Mayer H. Kaye A.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The responsible mitogenic core domain was localized to region 30-34 of the PTH molecule and uses the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate/Ca2+/PKC pathway. In addition, an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity was reported after treatment of different osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells with the carboxyl-terminal fragment PTH-(53-84) (25Murray T.M. Rao I.G. Muzaffar S.A. Ly H. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1097-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In summary, these observations led to the hypothesis that PTH is a polyhormone that is defined as a peptide containing several distinct regions, each possessing distinct biological activities (26Mallette L.E. Bilezikian J.P. Levine M.A. Marcus R. The Parathyroids. Raven Press Ltd., New York1994: 171Google Scholar). The respective implications and contributions of the two above-mentioned signal transduction pathways (adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C) in mediating the alterations of gene expression observed in PTH-responsive cells are not well understood. An insight into the roles of PKA- and PKC-dependent signals in PTH action would require the selective activation of either one of the two messenger systems. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine whether or not the PTH fragments PTH-(1-34) (harboring the adenylate cyclase- and PKC-activating domains) and PTH-(28-48) (harboring the PKC-activating domain only) have distinct effects on gene expression in osteoblastic ROS17/2.8 cells. We investigated the effects of the two PTH fragments on the expression of the two immediate-early genes c-fos and c-jun, which play important roles in regulating the expression of osteoblastic marker genes upon PTH application, and analyzed the response of osteoblastic marker genes upon PTH application. In addition, to identify further immediate-early genes involved in the signaling of the different PTH fragments, we have used subtractive cDNA cloning to characterize mRNAs expressed in ROS17/2.8 cells as a response to PTH induction. Osteoblastic rat osteosarcoma ROS17/2.8 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The medium was changed every other day, and the cells were subcultivated once a week. For cAMP assays, cells were plated in 6-well plates at 5200 cells/cm2; for thymidine incorporation assays, cells were seeded in microtiter plates at a density of 12,000 cells/cm2; and for RNA isolations, cells were seeded at 6000 cells/cm2 in tissue culture dishes with an area of 64 or 165 cm2. Upon reaching confluence, cells were grown in serum-free medium for 24 h. The cells were incubated, if not otherwise stated, for the indicated time periods with PTH-(1-34) (300 nM), PTH-(28-48) (300 nM), forskolin (100 µM), or TPA (1 µM), respectively. Cycloheximide treatment started 30 min before the addition of the inducers at 100 µg/ml. The synthetic human peptides PTH-(1-34) and PTH-(28-48) were obtained from the Peptide Synthesis Unit (Gesellschaft für Biotechnologische Forschung, Braunschweig, Germany). The purity of the peptides was verified by high pressure liquid chromatography (C18) and NMR spectroscopy. Cells were cultured as outlined above. The cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and preincubated for 20 min at 37°C in serum-free medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma), which inhibits phosphodiesterase activity. Stimulation was performed by an additional 15-min incubation with the corresponding PTH fragment. Incubation was stopped by aspirating the medium and washing the cells once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Incubations were conducted in triplicates. cAMP was extracted with 1 ml of acidified ethanol (1.75 ml of HCl, 100 ml of ethanol) overnight at -20°C. The extract was removed, evaporated to dryness, and redissolved in 200 µl of phosphate-buffered saline. Duplicates were assayed for cAMP by a competitive binding method using a commercially available [3H]cAMP radioassay kit (Amersham Buchler). Experimental values are expressed as picomoles of cAMP/well. The rate of DNA synthesis was assayed in monolayer culture by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into perchloric acid-precipitable material. Cells were cultivated in 200 µl of medium for 30 h in 96-well microtiter plates as described above. Then, the cells were washed once with serum-free medium, followed by an additional 30-h incubation in the latter medium. The indicated effector molecules were added, and incubation was continued for another 16 h. Radioactive DNA labeling was achieved by the addition of 10 µl of [3H]thymidine during the final 2 h of incubation. Subsequently, the medium was discarded, and the cells were lysed by 0.1 N NaOH. The DNA was precipitated by the addition of 2% perchloric acid for 30 min at 4°C. The precipitated material was transferred to Ready Filter X-tal (Beckman Instruments) with a Scatron Model AS semiautomatic cell harvester, washed with deionized water, and dried at 70°C. Precipitated radioactivity was determined with a β-counter using the X-tal program (Beckman Instruments). Incorporated radioactivity was compared with that of untreated control cells. Concerning the thymidine incorporation assay, each test consisted of 10 identically treated wells and was repeated at least three times, as outlined above. All other data were obtained in duplicates or triplicates in at least three independent experiments. Data are presented in a quantitative fashion as the means ± S.E. ROS17/2.8 cells were cultivated as described above. Cells were harvested at the indicated time intervals, and total RNA was isolated by guanidinium/CsCl step gradients. Total cellular RNA (10 µg) was separated electrophoretically on a 2.2 M formaldehyde, 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Hybridization was carried out with nick-translated 32P-labeled gene-specific DNA probes. The level of induction is the mean of at least three replicate experiments in relation to β-actin mRNA levels to correct for loading variations. Quantification was performed with an imaging system (WinCam 2.0, Cybertech, Berlin). Poly(A)+ RNA (mRNA) isolated from untreated (control) ROS17/2.8 cells or from cells after treatment with PTH-(1-34) or PTH-(28-48) was reverse-transcribed into double-stranded cDNA by a commercially available kit (Gibco-BRL). cDNAs were inserted directionally into the phagemid pTZ18R or pTZ19R (Pharmacia, Uppsala) following the method of Dorssers and Postmes (27Dorssers L. Postmes A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Four cDNA libraries were constructed in this respect: three cDNA libraries in pTZ18R from PTH-(1-34)-treated, PTH-(28-48)-treated, or control ROS17/2.8 cells (target libraries in (+)-orientation) and one control (driver) library in pTZ19R (in (-)-orientation). The cDNAs of the target libraries are in inverse orientation in regard to the cDNAs of the driver library. Libraries were established in Escherichia coli F′ (SURE) by electroporation. The primary cDNA libraries consisted of 3 × 105 individual cDNA clones in the case of the control (driver) cDNA library in (-)-orientation. The target cDNA libraries consisted of 4.8 × 105 individual cDNA colonies in the case of PTH-(28-48) treatment and 4.2 × 105 in the case of PTH-(1-34) treatment. 8.2 × 105 individual colonies were obtained from the control (target) cDNA library in (+)-orientation. Isolation of induced genes was performed by a combined method using subtraction followed by differential screening. The strategy is outlined in Fig. 1. Basically, a modified method of Duguid et al. (28Duguid J.R. Rohwer R.G. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5738-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) was used. For the generation of single-stranded cDNA, libraries in E. coli SURE were infected with the interference-defective helper phage M13K07. The resulting single-stranded libraries were purified by QIAGEN column chromatography (Diagen, Düsseldorf, Germany). Then, the single-stranded driver library in (-)- orientation was photobiotinylated in two rounds with a commercially available kit (Gibco-BRL) following the manufacturer's directions. 2.5 µg of single-stranded target cDNA from the two PTH-treated libraries in (+)-orientation were subjected to a two-round subtraction from 25 µg of the biotinylated single-stranded driver DNA library in (-)-orientation. The same procedure was applied to 2.5 µg of single-stranded cDNA from the control library in (+)-orientation, which was subtracted twice from 25 µg of the biotinylated control (driver) library. The latter step was essential for generating the control probe for the differential screening procedure following the subtraction (see below). Separation was achieved by streptavidin/phenol treatment. Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and the “reverse primer” complementary to a part of the lacZ gene in pTZ18R were used to convert the resulting single-stranded subtractive libraries into the double-stranded form. These double-stranded subtractive libraries were transferred into E. coli SURE by electroporation. The subtractive control library (from untreated control cells) consisted of 4.9 × 104 individual clones. The sizes of the subtractive libraries from PTH-(28-48)- and PTH-(1-34)-treated cells were 3.6 × 105 and 2.3 × 105 individual clones, respectively, indicating a reduction factor of 102/round of subtraction. The subtractive libraries originating from the PTH-induced cells were replica-plated onto nitrocellulose sheets. In parallel, the cDNA clones from all subtractive libraries were amplified, and the recombinant plasmids were isolated. The cDNA inserts were excised by digestion with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and HindIII. Inserts ranging from 0.5 to 3 kilobase pairs were eluted from the gel and used as hybridization probes in the differential screening step to follow. Replica-plated colonies from the PTH-(1-34) and PTH-(28-48) subtractive libraries were analyzed by colony hybridization with nick-translated 32P-labeled inserts either from the subtractive control library (representing the background of the system) or from the PTH-(1-34) or PTH-(28-48) subtractive library. Colonies exhibiting positive hybridization signals with the latter two probes were considered for further (Northern) analyses. Accession numbers for PTH-regulated cDNA sequences in the EMBL Data Library are X95079-X95094[GenBank][GenBank][GenBank][GenBank][GenBank][GenBank][GenBank][GenBank][GenBank][GenBank][GenBank][GenBank][GenBank][GenBank][GenBank]. The purpose of this study was to elucidate cAMP/PKA- as well as calcium/PKC-mediated gene expression after PTH treatment of ROS17/2.8 cells. Therefore, we analyzed and optimized the response of rat osteoblast-like ROS17/2.8 cells upon treatment with two PTH fragments, PTH-(1-34) (harboring the adenylate cyclase- and PKC-activating domains) and PTH-(28-48) (harboring the PKC-activating domain). A proliferative influence has been reported for both PTH fragments, but only the amino-terminal hormone fragment PTH-(1-34) is able to elicit a cAMP response (23Sümjen D. Binderman I. Schlüter K.-D. Wingender E. Mayer H. Kaye A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Majeska R.J. Rodan G.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1981; 33: 36Google Scholar). Regarding cAMP synthesis, under our experimental conditions, only PTH-(1-34) was able to invoke a response (Fig. 3). We observed a PTH-dependent stimulation of thymidine incorporation by both hormone fragments. However, the amino-terminal fragment always exhibited a reduced capacity for DNA synthesis in comparison with the cAMP-independent mid-regional PTH fragment at comparable concentrations (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Application of PTH-(28-48) at a concentration of 100 nM led to a 3-fold induction of DNA synthesis, which is not significantly elevated at higher fragment concentrations (data not shown). On the basis of these results, we treated ROS17/2.8 cells with PTH-(1-34) and PTH-(28-48) at concentrations of 300 nM, i.e. under conditions where the biological responses regarding cAMP-independent mitogenicity and cAMP synthesis are optimal in ROS17/2.8 cells.Fig. 2PTH-(1-34)- and PTH-(28-48)-mediated [3H]thymidine incorporation in ROS17/2.8 cells. Cells were plated, cultivated, exposed to the indicated doses of PTH-(1-34) or PTH-(28-48), and assayed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Values are the means ± S.E. of 7-10 individual tests.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PTH is able to activate all of these signal transduction pathways (see above). Both PTH fragments were applied in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. After 30 min, PTH-(1-34) as well as forskolin caused an increase of 2 orders of magnitude in c-fos transcripts. The response of c-fos to PTH-(28-48) treatment was considerably lower, while the protein kinase C activator TPA failed to elicit a significant c-fos response in these cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the c-jun transcripts (3.2 and 2.7 kilobases) were already constitutively expressed during the non-induced state in ROS17/2.8 cells. Treatment with PTH fragments led to a moderate increase in c-jun transcripts only (~3-fold) (Fig. 4B). As observed for c-fos, this induction was mimicked by treatment with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, but not with TPA, suggesting that the main pathway for c-fos and c-jun activation in these cells involves PKA activation. Induction was also observed in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), indicating that this response is independent of de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 4, A and B). It has also been documented that ornithine decarboxylase, which is an essential enzyme in polyamine synthesis and plays an important role in proliferation and differentiation, readily responds to PTH-(1-34) treatment in osteoblasts of various sources (34Takigawa M. Watanabe R. Ishida H. Asada A. Suzuki F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 84: 311-314Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 35Lüwik C.W.G.M. van Zeeland J.K. Hermann-Erlee M.P.M. Calcif.

PTH-(1-34) was able to increase the levels of ornithine decarboxylase transcripts alone and in the presence of CHX, which is in contrast to PTH-(28-48) (Fig. 5A) and which substantiates that ornithine decarboxylase is predominantly activated by the PKA pathway.Fig. 5Response of osteoblastic marker genes to application of PTH-(1-34) and PTH-(28-48). A, application of PTH-(1-34) and PTH-(28-48) for 4 h in the presence and absence of CHX; B, application of PTH-(1-34) and PTH-(28-48) for prolonged time periods. For Northern analyses, ROS17/2.8 cells were plated and treated essentially as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Hybridization was with probes of comparable specific activity, and the blots represent a 48-h exposure. The osteocalcin blots were exposed for 2 weeks. The level of induction is given as the level of induction/control. Values represent the mean of three replicate experiments in relation to β-actin mRNA levels to correct for loading variations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ROS17/2.8 cells express a high level of osteoblastic marker genes such as collagen α1(I), osteonectin, osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase, and the PTH/PTHrP receptor. The osteocalcin transcript, which is highly specific for late stages of osteoblastic development, was detected, albeit at a rather reduced level (Fig. 5A). Short-term application (4 h) of PTH-(1-34) and PTH-(28-48) in the presence or absence of CHX influenced only marginally the transcript levels for collagen α1(I), osteonectin, osteopontin, and the PTH/PTHrP receptor. In contrast, long-term application of PTH-(1-34) caused a down-regulation of the PTH/PTHrP receptor and alkaline phosphatase mRNA levels, while in this case, the level of osteocalcin mRNA was stimulated considerably (~5-fold) (Fig. 5B). ROS17/2.8 cells exhibited all traits of an osteoblastic cell line under our experimental conditions. We monitored fast as well as slow responses upon PTH treatment in this system. To further analyze the direct response of these osteoblastic cells upon PTH-(1-34) and PTH-(28-48) treatment, we performed subtractive cloning. PTH-(1-34) and PTH-(28-48) were applied in the presence of CHX for 4 h to subconfluent ROS17/2.8 cells. The presence of CHX during the PTH treatment should enable the isolation of mRNAs synthesized or stimulated by an immediate response in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, CHX exerts a stabilizing effect upon many unstable RNA species. The subtractive cDNA cloning of PTH-(1-34)- and PTH-(28-48)-inducible genes was performed with a modified phagemid system (28Duguid J.R. Rohwer R.G. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5738-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This strategy was combined with a differential screening procedure as detailed under “Materials and Methods” and outlined in Fig. 1. A total of 288 clones were scored as positive after the differential screening step. 75 of these were chosen at random to be further analyzed by Northern analyses (30 from the PTH-(28-48)- and 45 from the PTH-(1-34)-induced subtractive libraries). 29 clones were positive in detecting mRNAs stimulated by CHX, by PTH, or by combined PTH/CHX treatment. 18 of these were induced by CHX treatment only, while nine were induced either by PTH alone or by combined PTH/CHX treatment. These nine clones were characterized further by sequencing (Fig. 6 and Table I).TABLE I.Features of isolated cDNAs of enriched mRNAs after PTH treatmentcDNA clonemRNAInduced byLevel of induction after treatment with inducersPTH-(28-48)PTH-(28-48) + CHXPTH-(1-34)PTH-(1-34) + CHXCHXPTH-(1-34)PTH-(28-48)kbakb, kilobase; +, induced; -, non-induced.1-34I-11 (phosphodiesterase)4.5-+-+-3.81.61-34II-14.2-+-+-9.55.81-34II-5 (methyltransferase)5.2+++++2.01.31-34II-104.3---+-8.80.928-48II-181.5-+-+-179.128-48II-223.8---+-5.40.928-48II-28 (PKC substrate)4.4+++++5.12.628-48II-36 (GC-binding protein)4.4+++++14.44.128-48II-43 (junB)2-+-++3.12.5a kb, kilobase; +, induced; -, non-induced.

The cDNA clone 28-48II-36 represents the rat version of a cDNA encoding a novel GC-binding protein isolated from a murine cDNA library. 2M. Yamauchi, T. Swayne, R. Gray, B. Freitag, R. Lee, S. Barmada, B. Berwin, and E. Barklis, submitted for publication. Another clone (28-48II-43) harbors part of the rat immediate-early response gene junB. Four cDNAs for PTH-activated mRNAs are not functionally characterized at present (1-34II-1, 1-34II-10, 28-48I"
