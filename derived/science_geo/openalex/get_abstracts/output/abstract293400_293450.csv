https://openalex.org/W1986782082,"Additional x-ray structure studies on low chalcocite generally confirm the previously reported structure but show that either disorder is present or the true space group is not P2(1)/c but Pc, four of the 96 copper atoms in the monoclinic unit cell taking on twofold (linear) coordination. The crystal structure of djurleite has been solved in space group P2(1)/n, the monoclinic cell having parameters a = 26.897, b = 15.745, and c = 13.565 angstroms; beta = 90.13 degrees ; and a content of 248 copper and 128 sulfur atoms. Of the 62 different copper atoms in the structure, 52 are in threefold, triangular coordination with sulfur, nine in tetrahedral, and one in linear coordination."

The color phases are created by ""wax filaments"" that spread from the tips of miniature tubercles that cover the cuticle surface. The meshwork that accumulates at low humidity reduces transcuticular water loss and may lower the rate at which body temperature rises under a radiation load by increasing reflectance."
https://openalex.org/W2076222288,"Although the role of anions such as nitrate, chloride, and sulfate in inhibiting the crystallization of aluminum hydroxide in soils and geological deposits is generally accepted, the dramatic effect of the carbonate ion in maintaining aluminum hydroxide gel in the amorphous form has been overlooked by most earth scientists. Examination of bauxite occurrences suggests that the inhibiting effect of carbonate is quite apparent in the smaller grain size of gibbsite in karstic bauxite deposits as compared to that in lateritic bauxite. Scarbröite, a crystalline aluminum hydroxy carbonate, has been observed in rare instances. It is suggested that the highly reactive carbonate-containing aluminum hydroxide gels used as pharmaceutical antacids are amorphous or poorly crystalline forms of scarbröite. The effect of the sulfate anion is also apparent in certain bauxite deposits where dissolution of gibbsite by sulfuric acid has resulted from the oxidation of pyrite, with subsequent reprecipitation of gibbsite."

By varying the strength of the electric field, it is possible to change the size of the suspended droplets and even, if desired, to isolate a single drop."
