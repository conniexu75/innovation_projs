https://openalex.org/W2022484322,"Ethanol induces hemorrhagic gastric erosions and causes a dose-dependent decrease in the concentration of nonprotein sulfhydryl compounds in rat gastric mucosa. Sulfhydryl-containing drugs protect rats from ethanol-induced gastric erosions, whereas sulfhydryl blocking agents counteract the mucosal cytoprotective effect of prostaglandin F2 beta. These observations suggest that endogenous nonprotein sulfhydryls may mediate prostaglandin-induced gastric cytoprotection and that sulfhydryl drugs may have potential for preventing or treating hemorrhagic gastric erosions."
https://openalex.org/W2060258698,"We have measured the overall statistical efficiency of human subjects discriminating the amplitude of visual pattern signals added to noisy backgrounds. By changing the noise amplitude, the amount of intrinsic noise can be estimated and allowed for. For a target containing a few cycles of a spatial sinusoid of about 5 cycles per degree, the overall statistical efficiency is as high as 0.7 +/- 0.07, and after correction for intrinsic noise, efficiency reaches 0.83 +/- 0.15. Such a high figure leaves little room for residual inefficiencies in the neural mechanisms that handle these patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2061514522,"Ovariectomized adult female canaries were treated with physiological doses of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, or estradiol. Singing, which is typical of males, occurred in the testosterone-treated birds but not in any of the other birds. The effect of these hormones was assessed on dendrites from a class of neurons in the nucleus robustus archistriatalis (RA), a forebrain nucleus for song control. The RA neurons of the testosterone-treated birds had dendritic trees resembling those of intact males. The RA neurons of the estradiol- and dihydrotesterone-treated birds resembled those of intact females. All hormone-treated groups had dendrites that were significantly longer than those of untreated ovariectomized females. Thus gonadal hormones induce dendritic growth in the adult avian brain."

The responses of C- and A-fiber nociceptive afferents in the monkeys and subjective responses by the humans were compared. The burn resulted in increased sensitivity of the A fibers, decreased sensitivity of the C fibers, and increased pain sensibility (hyperalgesia) in the human subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2064832621,"Hyperthermic shock induces the synthesis of a novel protein (P71) in many rat tissues in vivo. In incubated rat tissue slices P71 is the major protein synthesized even though it is undetectable in the tissues of a normal, unstressed rat. P71 is ""heat shock"" protein, and it may be induced in vivo by stimuli other than hyperthermia. These results indicate that caution must be used in studies of protein synthesis in tissue explants, since the pattern of proteins synthesized by rat tissue slices is characteristic of stressed tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2054625309,An electron microscopic and electrophysiological investigation was made of Merkel cell-neurite complexes in the sinus hair follicles of the cat. These mechanoreceptors respond with very precise phase locking to heavy-frequency vibratory stimuli as well as to static hair displacements. The mechanoelectric transduction process is faster than that known for any other somatic mechanoreceptor. These data show that the nerve endings themselves and not the Merkel cells are the mechanoelectric transducer elements in these receptors.
https://openalex.org/W195608166,"We have studied a line of 3T6 mouse embryo fibroblasts grown in progressively increasing concentrations of methotrexate. Resistance of cells to low concentrations of the inhibitor (less than 5 X 10(-5) M) is attributed to selective multiplication of the genes coding for dihydrofolate reductase and the resulting elevation of enzyme content. Cells isolated at a higher methotrexate concentration (4 X 10(-4) M) contain high levels of a dihydrofolate reductase with a reduced affinity for methotrexate. The altered dihydrofolate reductase exhibits a 270-fold reduction in binding affinity for methotrexate as measured by equilibrium dialysis (Kd = 5.4 X 10(-8) M versus 2 X 10(-10) M for the wild type enzyme). While binding to NADPH is unchanged, the Km for dihydrofolate is increased 3-fold over wild type enzyme and the turnover number for the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate is decreased 20-fold. The altered dihydrofolate reductase shows a broader and more predominant acidic peak in its pH profile for this reaction. The molecular weights of the altered and wild type enzymes are identical as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, but 2-dimensional electrophoresis reveals a significant basic shift in the migration of the altered enzyme. Studies with various folic acid analogs suggest that modifications involving the para-aminobenzoyl moiety of the inhibitor molecules are associated with the most dramatic differential binding between the altered and wild type dihydrofolate reductases."
https://openalex.org/W2118856655,"Cultured peritoneal macrophages have previously been shown to release a potent mitogen for mesenchymal cells. Peritoneal macrophages are derived from peripheral blood monocytes, one of the principal inflammatory cells associated with numerous tissue responses to injury. Cultured human monocytes can be activated by endotoxin or concanavalin A to secrete a potent growth factor(s) that is active on human smooth muscle cells, human fibroblasts and 3T3 cells. The optimal conditions for activation of monocyte release of this monocyte derived growth factor(s) MDGF) were to expose 5-day-old monocyte cultures (initially plated at 6.8 X 10(5) cells/ml medium) to 10 microgram/ml endotoxin or 6 microgram/ml concanavalin A for approximately 20 hr. Monocytes can secrete MDGF into serum-free medium supplemented with 0.15% bovine serum albumin, MDGF stimulates both DNA synthesis and increase in cell number and is trypsin-sensitive, heat labile and nondialyzable. The relationship of MDGF to other monocyte products and its potential importance in wound repair and atherogenesis are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1990109007,"Coupling mass spectrometers in series provides a new technique that has many advantages for the analysis of specific organic compounds in complex mixtures. Sensitivity to picograms of targeted compounds can be achieved with high specificity and nearly instantaneous response. The targeted compound is selectively ionized, and its characteristic ions are separated from most others of the mixture in the first mass spectrometer. The selected primary ions are then decomposed by collision, and from the resulting products the final mass analyzer selects secondary ions characteristic of the targeted compound. Tandem mass spectrometry can achieve specificities and sensitivities equivalent of those of methods such as radioimmunoassay and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, while performing analyses in much shorter times."
https://openalex.org/W1989338836,"I have tested the hypothesis that at least some of the known tumor promoters may act by facilitating gene amplification. A series of single-step selections for resistance to methotrexate, a specific inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), was carried out with 3T6 cells in the presence and in the absence of a potent tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Incidence of methotrexate-resistant, colony-forming 3T6 cells is increased up to 100 fold if selection is carried out in the presence of TPA. For a major portion of this new TPA effect to be observed, it is sufficient to add TPA simultaneously with methotrexate. The effect of TPA on the incidence of methotrexate resistance is detectable at less than 20 nM TPA and is maximal at about 200 nM TPA. Phorbol (a nonpromoting analog of TPA), thymidine and dimethylsulfoxide each fail to produce any TPA-like effect in this system. DHFR gene copy numbers per cell in clones resistant to 100, 200 and 300 nM methotrexate are approximately 3, 10 and 16 times higher, respectively, than the DHFR gene copy number in the parental 3T6 cells. These numbers do not depend on the presence or absence of TPA during methotrexate selection."

https://openalex.org/W2071021913,"Poxviruses, unlike other DNA viruses, replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells and use their own system of transcription. Examination of one early mRNA synthesized in vivo and in vitro indicated that it has multiple closely spaced 5′ and 3′ ends. A remarkable 88% AT-rich 60 by DNA sequence was found immediately upstream of the initiation of transcription sites. Although DNA sequences that bear some homology to Pribnow and Hogness boxes are present, additional recognition sequences located further upstream of procaryotic and eucaryotic initiation sites are absent. A possible initiation of translation codon occurs about 50 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the message. The transcript terminates near or within a hexanucleotide CTATTC that is tandemly repeated four times. Sequences similar to those regulating termination of transcription in procaryotes or poly(A) addition in eucaryotes were not found, suggesting that poxviruses have evolved unique recognition signals."

https://openalex.org/W1986592101,"We have determined the DNA sequence of a 770 by Pst I fragment containing 450 nucleotides of the 5′ flanking region of the chicken lysozyme gene. S1-nuclease mapping was performed to localize the 5′ end of nuclear RNA containing lysozyme-specific sequences and of the mRNA. We present evidence that the 5′ noncoding region of the chicken lysozyme mRNA is heterogeneous in length. The 5′ termini of the different mRNAs map 29, 31 and 53 nucleotides upstream from their common initiation codon. The 5′ ends of lysozyme-specific nuclear RNAs map at positions similar to that of the mRNA. AT-rich regions and sequences similar to the E. coli RNA polymerase recognition sequence are found around 30 and 70 nucleotides upstream from each of these 5′ termini. The AT-rich regions differ, however, from the canonical Goldberg-Hogness box in that they do not contain the extremely conserved TATA sequence motif. Sequence comparison at the 5′ end of the lysozyme, conalbumin and ovalbumin genes reveals only one region of partial homology, 140 nucleotides upstream from the mRNA start sites."
https://openalex.org/W2085940695,Field potentials and extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o) were simultaneously monitored in the molecular layer of the rat cerebellar cortex during stimulation of the parallel fibers. The synaptic field potential elicited by stimulation was reduced by several methods. Reduction of synaptic field potentials was accompanied by a marked increase in the excitability of the parallel fibers. This change in excitability was related to the degree of extracellular K+ accumulation associated with parallel fiber stimulation. These findings support the proposal that increases in [K+]o associated with activity in postsynaptic elements can modulate the excitability of presynaptic afferent fibers.
https://openalex.org/W1974868147,"The perception of emotion in verbal and facial expression, and the spontaneous production of conversational speech were studied in patients with unilateral focal excisions of frontal, temporal, or parieto-occipital cortex. Lesions of the left hemisphere impaired the matching of verbal descriptions to appropriate verbal categories of emotional states, whereas with lesions of the right hemisphere, the matching of different faces displaying similar emotional states was impaired. The effects of lesions of both left and right hemisphere occurred regardless of the locus of the lesion. On the other hand, frontal-lobe lesions had differential effects upon unsolicited talking; lesions of the left frontal lobe virtually abolished this behavior, whereas lesions of the right frontal lobe produced excessive talking. These data suggest that the nature of the behavioral stimulus as well as the locus and side of damage must be considered in the study of the neural basis of affective behavior."
https://openalex.org/W105949446,"Interaction and electron transfer between highly purified microsomal cytochrome P-450 from phenobarbital-induced rabbits and cytochrome b5 from uninduced rabbits was investigated by difference and stopped-flow spectrophotometry. Formation of a 1:1 complex between ferric P-450 and b5, demonstrated by difference spectrophotometry, was observed only when both cytochromes were incorporated into micelles of phosphatidylcholine. The dissociation constant (Kd) of the complex was decreased from 2.3 microM to 0.4 microM in the presence of 1 mM benzphetamine. The apparent Kd of benzphetamine was reduced from 220 microM to 50 microM upon addition of b5. The influence of ferrous b5 on the autooxidation of the oxyferrous intermediate of P-450 in the presence and in the absence of substrate was investigated by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. Both cytochromes were reduced photochemically, so that experiments could be carried out in the absence of the corresponding reductases and reduced pyridine nucleotides. Kinetic analysis of the data showed that formation of a 1:1 complex between ferrous P-450 and b5 was a prerequisite for electron transfer between the cytochromes. Here again, incorporation of both cytochromes into micelles was absolutely required for this process. Kd was decreased from 7.5 microM to 2.2 microM in the presence of 1 mM benzphetamine. The rate of electron transfer from b5 to oxyferrous P-450, derived from the kinetics of reoxidation of either b5 or P-450, was increased from 2.5 s-1 to about 4 to 7 s-1 in the presence of 1 mM benzphetamine. These results provide the first quantitative data on the electron transfer between the b5 and P-450, whose rate constant is compatible with the observations made on the effect of b5 on hydroxylation reactions catalyzed by the P-450 enzyme system."
https://openalex.org/W1976617783,"Mutant L cells, designated LR cells, were isolated after ""curing"" a persistently infected cell line (L/C) with antireovirus serum. The LR cells were shown to be virus-free; no reovirus was detectable by infectious center assays, plaque assays, presence of viral proteins, presence of viral dsRNA and immunofluorescence studies. Persistent infections were readily established n LR cells following infection with either cloned, low passage wild-type reovirus or cloned, low passage reovirus isolated from carrier cultures. Reovirus isolated from carrier cultures, however, grew much better than wild-type reovirus in LR cells and showed complete dominance over wild-type reovirus in coinfection experiments. Infection of LR cells with wild-type reovirus resulted in a low-level persistent infection with inefficient viral replication; these mutant L cells were partially resistant to infection with wild-type reovirus. In contrast, infection of the mutant L cells with virus isolated from the persistently infected cells resulted in a persistent infection accompanied with efficient viral replication. Infection of the original L cells with either wild-type reovirus or reovirus isolated from the persistently infected cells resulted in a lytic infection with no surviving cells. Thus the host cell plays a crucial role in the maintenance of persistent reovirus infection. Our results show that there is a coevolution of both mutant L cells and mutant reovirus during persistent infection."

Complex olfactory learning may be mediated by the olfactory thalamocortical system and not by olfactory projections to the limbic system.
https://openalex.org/W1998002010,"The use of intact bacterial cells or tissue slices of plant and animal origin as immobilized biocatalysts has extended the possible range of potentiometric bioselective membrane electrodes beyond that of conventional enzyme electrodes. The use of such materials as biocatalysts offers advantages in situations where isolated enzymes are not available or where multistep reaction paths are required. The resulting bioselective electrodes also offer exceptional ease of preparation, time stability, and low cost."
https://openalex.org/W2169835829,"Almond emulsin peptide:N-glycosidase has been partially purified by using a new 3H-labeled 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-octaglycopeptide substrate derived from ovalbumin. The enzyme hydrolyzes the beta-aspartylglycosylamine linkage of both high mannose and biantennary complex glycopeptides, as shown by the isolation of the corresponding carbohydrate-free peptides containing aspartic acid and intact oligosaccharides with the core di-N-acetylchitobiosyl moiety at the reducing end. Complex glycopeptides appear to be the preferred substrates. The location of the oligosaccharide on the peptide backbone and its chain length are major determinants for enzymatic activity. Glycosylated asparagine residues are hydrolyzed less favorably if present at the carboxyl- or NH2-terminal position of a peptide chain. Glycopeptides containing long, bulky oligosaccharide chains are cleaved by peptide:N-glycosidase at least 15-fold faster than their corresponding endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-modified, peptide-GlcNAc counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W1487734642,"In the presence of a salt in an excess amount, the oxidation of native MbO2 was enhanced considerably above the normal autoxidation in buffr alone with the formation of the corresponding MetMb . anion complex. This anion-induced oxidation of MbO2 was measured for each salt at some 30 different values of pH in 0.1 M buffer at 25 degrees C. The anions examined were SCN-, F-, OCN-, N3- and CN-. The resulting pH dependence shows that the reaction involves two types of the displacement processes of O2- from MbO2 by the anion, i.e. those with and without proton assistance. The Bronsted plots for the rate constants versus the pKa values of the conjugate acids of anions indicate that the displacing oxidation of MbO2 proceeds by way of a nucleophilic attack of anions on the iron center and that both H2O and OH- can react with native MbO2 as the most common nucleophiles in vivo. These findings lead to a view that the proton-catalyzed nucleophilic displacement of O2- from MbO2 by an entering water molecule, or SN2 mechanism with proton assistance, is the basis for most of the autoxidation reaction under normal conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2094659428,"The effects of diffuse cerebral dysfunction on oculomotor reaction time were assessed in patients with dementia of presumed Alzheimer's etiology and in normal age-matched control subjects. Patients were classified into mild, moderate, and severe groups on the basis of independent neurological, neuropsychological, and neuroradiological ratings for disease severity. Saccadic latencies to targets appearing in parafoveal and near peripheral vision showed significant increases from the normal controls to dementia groups, with each severity subdivision clearly differentiated from the others in terms of mean oculomotor reaction time. These data offer strong evidence for a direct relationship between degree of cortical structural integrity and simple oculomotor reaction time and suggest a higher cortical regulatory role in sensory-motor integration."
https://openalex.org/W1512043388,"The interaction of terbium(III) (Tb3+) with synthetic and native nucleic acids, including circular supercoiled DNA, has been studied. Fluorescence spectroscopy has revealed that: (a) the intrinsic fluorescence of Tb3+ is greatly enhanced upon binding either xanthine or guanine residues; (b) slight chemical modification of the nucleoside bases abrogates energy transfer; (c) binding affinity increases with chain length; (d) protonation of the N-7 site of xanthine or guanine obviates energy transfer in Tb3+-homopolynucleotide complexes; and (e) unimpaired base residues in supercoiled DNA are capable of measurably enhancing Tb3+ fluorescence. In addition, equilibrium dialysis experiments with 160Tb3+ show that double helical polynucleotides (which do not enhance Tb3+ emission) bind more cation/molar nucleotide residue than do single-stranded polynucleotides. Melting profiles demonstrate that at low Tb3+: base ratios, the lanthanide destabilizes helical DNA and prevents reannealing of strands following thermal denaturation. These data suggest the existence of two Tb3+ binding sites on the unpaired residues of polynucleotide chains: the phosphate moiety and electron donor groups on the nucleoside bases."
https://openalex.org/W1505498207,"The rates of type I collagen synthesis in sheep lung, tendon, and skin were evaluated during the latter half of fetal development and compared with the levels of type I procollagen mRNA, quantified by molecular hybridization with a type I procollagen specific complementary DNA, and with the activity of total procollagen mRNA measured by in vitro cell-free translation. In the lung and tendon, the levels of type I procollagen mRNA and activity of total procollagen mRNA parallel collagen synthesis during development. In the skin, however, type I collagen synthesis declines sharply during fetal development, but both type I procollagen mRNA levels and total procollagen mRNA activity remain at the high levels of early development. These observations suggest that in developing lung and tendon, type I procollagen mRNA levels are likely the major determinants of the levels of type I collagen synthesis. In contrast, the dichotomy between type I procollagen mRNA levels and rates of type I collagen synthesis in the developing sheep skin suggest the skin utilizes mechanisms in addition to mRNA levels to modulate expression of the type I collagen gene."
https://openalex.org/W1967088046,"A photoregulated chelating agent has been synthesized. It is a photochromic azobenzene compound containing two iminodiacetic acid groups and can exists as cis and trans stereoisomers. The planar trans isomer does not bind zinc ions. On exposure to light of 320 nanometers, the trans isomer is converted to a nonplanar cis isomer, which, because of cooperativity between the two iminodiacetic acid groups, binds zinc ions with the value of the binding constant estimated to be 1.1 x 10(5) +/- 9.2 x 10(5) liters per mole at a ratio of one molecule of chelating agent to one zinc ion. The interconversion of the cis and trans isomers is reversible, suggesting possible application of this class of compounds as photoresponsive ion pumps."

https://openalex.org/W1579247397,"We report here the purification of an angiogenic substance from the Walker 256 rat ascites tumor which is mitogenic for fetal bovine aortic endothelial cells in culture and which also stimulates new blood vessel growth in vivo. Purification was monitored in endothelial cell cultures by cell counting or by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Lyophilized crude tumor cell homogenate was extracted with absolute ethanol, and the extract was further purified by silica gel column chromatography. The most purified material eluted with ethyl acetate:methanol (25:1) and behaved as a single component when analyzed either by thin layer chromatography with both silica gel and polyethylene-imine-cellulose systems or by reversed phase (C18) high pressure liquid chromatography. Bio-Gel P-30 chromatography indicates a Mr 400-800 for the active material. The mitogenic activity of the purified material was observed with the vascular endothelial cells cultured in serum-less as well as serum-containing media. The angiogenic activity of this material was revealed in both the chicken chorioallantoic membrane and rat corneal micropocket bioassays. Our results demonstrate that a factor with mitogenic and angiogenic activities can be purified from the Walker rat tumor by a novel, facile, and high yield process."

https://openalex.org/W1522861351,"The enzymatic reduction of acyl-CoA to long chain alcohol by NADPH ion a particulate fraction from developing rat brain has been studied in detail. Addition of serum album in to the assay stimulated activity, due to protection of the substrate acyl-CoA from hydrolysis by an endogenous hydrolase. The optimum amount of albumin depended upon the amount of acyl-CoA added and was found to be 0.5 to 2.0 mol of albumin/mol of acyl-CoA. A series of saturated and unsaturated acyl-CoAs from C12 to C22 was tested, and it was found that the enzyme was specific for only the palmitoyl (16:0)-, stearoyl (18:0)-, and oleoyl (18:1)-CoAs, thus accounting for the observed ether lipid composition in brain. The enzyme specifically utilized only B side hydrogen of [4-3H]NADPH (2 mol/mol of alcohol formed). By various criteria, it was shown that free palmitaldehyde was not an intermediate of the reaction, implying that a single enzyme catalyzes the two consecutive reductions. However, small amounts of palmitaldehyde were produced by this system and were shown to be derived from the same enzyme; probably resulting from partial degradation of an unstable enzyme-bound intermediate. Activity was fully inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents, and from the results of substrate protection experiments, it was concluded that an essential thiol was located at the active site of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2024048974,"Rat hearts perfused with calcium-free media exhibit an age-dependent response when a normal calcium concentration is restored to the perfusate. The response of 15- and 26-day hearts is an explosive cell death which includes immediate cessation of contractile activity, as well as release of large amounts of creatine phosphokinase activity and myoglobin. Between birth and 15 days of age, the sensitivity of the heart to this calcium-induced cellular disruption changes from a relative insensitivity before 6 days of age to a slight but constant sensitivity from 7 to 11 days of age, and to full sensitivity at 15 days of age. This pattern of sensitivity may be due to the rapid increase in complexity and quantity of the membrane systems of cardiac myocytes during the first 15 days of growth."
https://openalex.org/W1544928360,"The presence of 10 mM sodium molybdate has a profound effect on the physical behavior of glucocorticoid receptors submitted to ammonium sulfate precipitation or to DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Molybdate inhibits the inactivation of the unoccupied receptor and prevents the transformation of the steroid-bound receptor that occurs when rat liver cytosol is precipitated with ammonium sulfate. The transformed glucocorticoid . receptor complex is precipitated at 30 to 35% ammonium sulfate, whereas the unoccupied receptor and the untransformed steroid-bound receptor are precipitated at 45 to 55% of ammonium sulfate saturation. The untransformed steroid . receptor complex precipitated at 45 to 55% ammonium sulfate saturation in the presence of molybdate can undergo temperature-mediated transformation when it is redissolved in buffer without molybdate. The presence of molybdate in both the loading buffer and eluting gradient during DEAE-cellulose chromatography prevents the transformation of steroid-bound receptor to a less negatively charged, DNA-binding state which otherwise occurs during the chromatographic procedure. In the presence of molybdate, DEAE-chromatography yields a 33-fold purification of the untransformed steroid . receptor complex."

https://openalex.org/W1550311908,"The biosynthesis and processing of type V procollagens was investigated in chick embryo blood vessels labeled with radioactive amino acids. Monomeric, pepsin-sensitive pro alpha 1 V and pro alpha 2 V chains are slowly assembled into triple helically folded molecules. A small proportion of these procollagen V molecules contain interchain disulfide bridges, and the disulfide-linked heterodimer and heterotrimer (pro alpha 1 V)2pro alpha 2 V were found. A relatively fast conversion of procollagen V to p-collagen V is followed by slow change to collagen V. This time course is similar to the processing of procollagen III and is much slower than the rate of appearance of type I collagen in blood vessels. A combination of sedimentation and electrophoretic analyses was used to measure the relative size of the type V chains and to demonstrate attachment of noncollagenous peptides (Mr = 33,000) to p alpha 2 V by disulfide linkage. Similar quantitative pulse-chase studies were made with calvaria and crop. As the same unusual features of assembly and processing of type V chains were seen in muscle, bone, and blood vessels, we conclude that these are characteristic of type V collagen biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1488363328,"The enzyme kinetics of estrogen 2-hydroxylase from rat liver microsomes has been investigated using two radiotracer methods. The conversion of [4-14C]estradiol to [4-14C]2-hydroxyestradiol by microsomes was examined by isolation of the catechol estrogen. [6,7-3H]2-Hydroxyestradiol was prepared and added at the end of the incubation as a recovery marker for quantitation. Initial velocity conditions of less than 10% product formation were established. The enzyme kinetics for estrogen 2-hydroxylase from male rat liver follows classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics producing a linear Lineweaver-Burk plot. The apparent Km for estradiol under these conditions was 2.2 microM; the Vmax for freshly prepared microsomes was 5.0 nmol/mg/min while that for microsomes stored at -70 degrees C was 0.51 nmol/mg/min. On the other hand, estrogen 2-hydroxylase from female rat liver microsomes did not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics and yielded a nonlinear double reciprocal plot. Analogous kinetic data were obtained with another radiotracer assay measuring the release of 3H2O from [2-3H]estradiol. Thus, the estrogen 2-hydroxylases of male and female rat liver differ in enzyme kinetic properties. The upwardly curving Lineweaver-Burk plot of the kinetic data of the female rat liver microsomes suggests that more than one binding site for estradiol may exist on this enzyme complex and/or that this particular estrogen 2-hydroxylase system exhibits cooperative effects."
https://openalex.org/W2070708460,"Visually conditioned heart rate change in the pigeon has been developed as a vertebrate model system for the cellular neurophysiological analysis of associative learning. In previous studies of the ""final common path,"" it was shown that both the vagal and sympathetic cardiac innervations contribute to this response. The present experiments indicate that, prior to any behavioral training, the visual stimulus elicits a small decrease in the discharge of vagal cardiac neurons. During conditioning, this stimulus evokes a progressively greater decrease in discharge that parallels the acquisition of the conditioned cardioacceleration. In contrast, nonassociative control animals show habituation of the initial decrease in discharge. These data confirm the involvement of the vagal cardiac innervation in conditioned heart rate change, indicate that the vagal innervation acts synergistically with the sympathetic to produce cardioacceleration, and suggest that a short-latency pathway mediates the conditioned response."

https://openalex.org/W1563014186,"A new method for studying the physicochemical determinants of IgE-mediated activation of basophils is described. Rat basophil leukemia cells having IgE receptors were preincubated with monoclonal anti-dinitrophenyl IgE. These cells were then exposed to liposomes containing dinitrophenyl conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine. The release of serotonin was measured. Using this system it was observed that liposomes containing dinitrophenyl conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine by aminoethylformamidomethoxy acetyl (but not by caproic acid) were able to trigger the release of serotonin. Solid liposomes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and 2 mol % hapten were more potent inducers of serotonin release than liposomes composed of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and hapten, but the fluid liposomes definitely triggered the cells to release serotonin. The addition of cholesterol to both types of liposomes enhanced their potency as activators and diminished the difference between the two types of phospholipid. This occurred despite the fact that cholesterol renders the solid liposomes fluid. Since it is unlikely that these fluid membranes can provide lateral forces that produce IgE-Fc receptor molecular clustering, we conclude that either receptor clustering is not necessary for basophil triggering, or molecular clustering is driven by molecular forces derived from IgE and components of the basophil cell."

(1979) FEBS Let. 100, 253-257) with a sugar composition identical with that of GM1, II3 alpha NeuAc-GgOse4Cer (Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc beta 1 leads to 4Gal(3 leads from 2 alpha NeuAc) beta 1 leads to 4G1c beta 1 leads to 1'ceramide), isolated from rat ascites hepatoma was further characterized. In contrast to GM1, the sialic acid in this ganglioside was susceptible to clostridial sialidase in the absence of bile salts. Based on the sequential enzymic hydrolysis, permethylation analysis and direct probe mass spectrometric analysis, the structure of this ganglioside is determined to be: NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc beta 1 leads to 4Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc leads to ceramide. The structure of this ganglioside is identical with that biosynthesized in vitro (Stoffyn, A., Stoffyn, P., and Yip, M. C. M. (1975) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 409, 97-103)."
https://openalex.org/W1559690733,"Abstract The role of different thyroid states on the rate of rat liver glucokinase synthesis and degradation was studied in vivo by the radioimmunochemical technique. In eu- and hyperthyroid starved rats, glucose refeeding induced a rapid and similar increase in glucokiase synthesis and activity, whereas in hypothyroid rats, only minor alterations in synthesis and activity was observed. 3,3',5'-Triiodo-L-thyronine substitution in hypothyroid animals restored the response of the enzyme within 24 h. The thyroid states per se had only a minor effect on glucokinase synthesis during the starvation period. In addition, in hypo-, eu-, and hyperthyroid rats adapted to a glucose diet, glucokinase degradation was estimated by double-pulse-labeling experiments, applying [14C]- and [3H]leucine. From the 3H/14C ratios, similar apparent half-lives were calculated: 17-19 h. It is concluded that thyroid hormones in their physiological range are an essential factor in the induction of hepatic glucokinase in vivo, exerting their action probably via a permissive effect, yet the degradation rate is unaffected by the thyroid state."
https://openalex.org/W2019715964,"Each of four monkeys (Macaca mulatta) was operantly conditioned to slow and to speed heart rate through a shock-avoidance procedure. During these sessions, electrical brain stimulation that produced tachycardia and pressor responses was delivered on alternate, 64-second segments to one of several brain regions. All animals were able to attenuate the increases in heart rate produced by brain stimulation during the slowing sessions when posterior hypothalamic and striatal regions were stimulated but not when anterior hypothalamic or subthalamic areas were stimulated. During speeding or control sessions during which heart rate was monitored, brain stimulation continued to increase heart rate."

https://openalex.org/W2088114612,"Su+7 tRNA, the amber-suppressing anticodon mutant of tRNA(Trp) (E. coli), also relaxes stringent control. Further mutant Su+7 tRNAs have been isolated that have lost this regulatory effect. The sequence changes we have observed are a unique set. They include partially active suppressor tRNAs with a C to A change in the T pseudo uracil CG common sequence and in the anticodon stem. The activity of the T pseudo uracil CG and anticodon-stem mutants suggests that neither sequence is essential for ribosomal function. The third mutated site, a D-stem alteration, dramatically disturbs tRNA maturation. The mutations add to our knowledge of tRNA function, particularly with regard to the dispensability of the T pseudo uracil CG sequence for activity at the ribosomal A site."
https://openalex.org/W2016687245,"The erythrocytes of the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), an egg-laying mammal, were examined for the presence of phosphorylated compounds. The erythrocytes contained only 0.03 +/- 0.01 micromoles of adenosine 5'-triphosphate per milliliter of cells. This amount is two orders of magnitude less than that in human cells. Although the echidna erythrocytes had an abundance of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and other glycolytic intermediates, no other energy-rich pyridine and purine compounds were detected."

https://openalex.org/W1548224534,"3-Phosphoglycerate kinase was isolated from horse muscle and subjected to the action of cyanogen bromide. The resulting peptides were separated using gel filtration combined with either ion exchange chromatography on phosphocellulose in 6 M urea or high voltage paper electrophoresis. The sequence of the largest peptide, CB5, has been determined by a combination of automated and manual Edman degradation carried out on the intact peptide and derivatives obtained by proteolytic digestion. The isolation of two peptides derived from CB5 by cleavage of the bond between Asp109 and Pro110 facilitated the sequence analysis of CB5. The sequence analysis of the remaining 13 cyanogen bromide fragments and the complete sequence of the enzyme are described in the second paper of this series (Merrett, M. (1981), J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10293-10305)."
