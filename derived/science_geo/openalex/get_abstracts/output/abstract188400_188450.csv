https://openalex.org/W1999625215,"When small numbers of colloidal microspheres are attached to the surfaces of liquid emulsion droplets, removing fluid from the droplets leads to packings of spheres that minimize the second moment of the mass distribution. The structures of the packings range from sphere doublets, triangles, and tetrahedra to exotic polyhedra not found in infinite lattice packings, molecules, or minimum-potential energy clusters. The emulsion system presents a route to produce new colloidal structures and a means to study how different physical constraints affect symmetry in small parcels of matter."

https://openalex.org/W1976065917,"Barriers to dispersal between populations allow them to diverge through local adaptation or random genetic drift. High-resolution multilocus sequence analysis revealed that, on a global scale, populations of hyperthermophilic microorganisms are isolated from one another by geographic barriers and have diverged over the course of their recent evolutionary history. The identification of a biogeographic pattern in the archaeon Sulfolobus challenges the current model of microbial biodiversity in which unrestricted dispersal constrains the development of global species richness."
https://openalex.org/W1988917342,"The multidomain proapoptotic molecules BAK or BAX are required to initiate the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. How cells maintain the potentially lethal proapoptotic effector BAK in a monomeric inactive conformation at mitochondria is unknown. In viable cells, we found BAK complexed with mitochondrial outer-membrane protein VDAC2, a VDAC isoform present in low abundance that interacts specifically with the inactive conformer of BAK. Cells deficient in VDAC2, but not cells lacking the more abundant VDAC1, exhibited enhanced BAK oligomerization and were more susceptible to apoptotic death. Conversely, overexpression of VDAC2 selectively prevented BAK activation and inhibited the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Death signals activate ""BH3-only"" molecules such as tBID, BIM, or BAD, which displace VDAC2 from BAK, enabling homo-oligomerization of BAK and apoptosis. Thus, VDAC2, an isoform restricted to mammals, regulates the activity of BAK and provides a connection between mitochondrial physiology and the core apoptotic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2100378386,"Rearrangement of RET proto-oncogene is the major event in the etiopathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). We report a high prevalence of BRAFV599E mutation in sporadic PTC and in PTC-derived cell lines. The BRAFV599E mutation was detected in 23 of 50 PTC (46%) and in three of four PTC-derived cell lines. The prevalence of the BRAFV599E mutation in PTC is the highest reported to date in human carcinomas, being only exceeded by melanoma. PTC with RET/PTC rearrangement as well as the TPC-1 cell line (the only one harboring RET/PTC rearrangement) did not show the BRAFV599E mutation. BRAFV599E mutation was not detected in any of 23 nodular goiters, 51 follicular adenomas and 18 follicular carcinomas. A distinct mutation in BRAF (codon K600E) was detected in a follicular adenoma. Activating mutations in RAS genes were detected in 15% of FA, 33% of FTC and 7% of PTC. BRAFV599E mutation did not coexist with alterations in any of the RAS genes in any of the tumors. These results suggest that BRAFV599E mutation is frequent in the etiopathogenesis of PTC. The BRAFV599E mutation appears to be an alternative event to RET/PTC rearrangement rather than to RAS mutations, which are rare in PTC. BRAFV599E may represent an alternative pathway to oncogenic MAPK activation in PTCs without RET/PTC activation."

https://openalex.org/W2151571592,"Observations indicate that the height of the tropopause-the boundary between the stratosphere and troposphere-has increased by several hundred meters since 1979. Comparable increases are evident in climate model experiments. The latter show that human-induced changes in ozone and well-mixed greenhouse gases account for approximately 80% of the simulated rise in tropopause height over 1979-1999. Their primary contributions are through cooling of the stratosphere (caused by ozone) and warming of the troposphere (caused by well-mixed greenhouse gases). A model-predicted fingerprint of tropopause height changes is statistically detectable in two different observational (""reanalysis"") data sets. This positive detection result allows us to attribute overall tropopause height changes to a combination of anthropogenic and natural external forcings, with the anthropogenic component predominating."
https://openalex.org/W2057655240,"Strontium, carbon, and oxygen isotope data and radiocarbon ages document at least 30,000 years of hydrothermal activity driven by serpentinization reactions at Lost City. Serpentinization beneath this off-axis field is estimated to occur at a minimum rate of 1.2 x 10(-4) cubic kilometers per year. The access of seawater to relatively cool, fresh peridotite, coupled with faulting, volumetric expansion, and mass wasting processes, are crucial to sustain such systems. The amount of heat produced by serpentinization of peridotite massifs, typical of slow and ultraslow spreading environments, has the potential to drive Lost City-type systems for hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of years."
https://openalex.org/W2133493439,"The Hawaiian-Emperor hotspot track has a prominent bend, which has served as the basis for the theory that the Hawaiian hotspot, fixed in the deep mantle, traced a change in plate motion. However, paleomagnetic and radiometric age data from samples recovered by ocean drilling define an age-progressive paleolatitude history, indicating that the Emperor Seamount trend was principally formed by the rapid motion (over 40 millimeters per year) of the Hawaiian hotspot plume during Late Cretaceous to early-Tertiary times (81 to 47 million years ago). Evidence for motion of the Hawaiian plume affects models of mantle convection and plate tectonics, changing our understanding of terrestrial dynamics."

To determine the basis of the net force imbalance that causes spindle displacement in one-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, we fragmented centrosomes with an ultraviolet laser. Analysis of the mean and variance of fragment speeds suggests that the force imbalance is due to a larger number of force generators pulling on astral microtubules of the posterior aster relative to the anterior aster. Moreover, activation of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide- binding protein (Gprotein) alpha subunits is required to generate these astral forces."

https://openalex.org/W1985111805,"The subplate forms a transient circuit required for development of connections between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex. When subplate neurons are ablated, ocular dominance columns do not form in the visual cortex despite the robust presence of thalamic axons in layer 4. We show that subplate ablation also prevents formation of orientation columns. Visual responses are weak and poorly tuned to orientation. Furthermore, thalamocortical synaptic transmission fails to strengthen, whereas intracortical synapses are unaffected. Thus, subplate circuits are essential not only for the anatomical segregation of thalamic inputs but also for key steps in synaptic remodeling and maturation needed to establish the functional architecture of visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1990540601,"It is well known that hunting dramatically reduced all baleen whale populations, yet reliable estimates of former whale abundances are elusive. Based on coalescent models for mitochondrial DNA sequence variation, the genetic diversity of North Atlantic whales suggests population sizes of approximately 240,000 humpback, 360,000 fin, and 265,000 minke whales. Estimates for fin and humpback whales are far greater than those previously calculated for prewhaling populations and 6 to 20 times higher than present-day population estimates. Such discrepancies suggest the need for a quantitative reevaluation of historical whale populations and a fundamental revision in our conception of the natural state of the oceans."
https://openalex.org/W1969695473,"Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) regulate the development and growth of the blood and lymphatic vascular systems. Of the three VEGF receptors (VEGFR), VEGFR-1 and -2 are expressed on blood vessels; VEGFR-2 is found also on lymphatic vessels. VEGFR-3 is expressed mainly on lymphatic vessels but it is also up-regulated in tumor angiogenesis. Although VEGFR-3 is essential for proper lymphatic development, its signal transduction mechanisms are still incompletely understood. Trans-phosphorylation of activated, dimerized receptor tyrosine kinases is known to be critical for the regulation of kinase activity and for receptor interaction with signal transduction molecules. In this study, we have identified five tyrosyl phosphorylation sites in the VEGFR-3 carboxyl-terminal tail. These sites were used both in VEGFR-3 overexpressed in 293 cells and when the endogenous VEGFR-3 was activated in lymphatic endothelial cells. Interestingly, VEGF-C stimulation of lymphatic endothelial cells also induced the formation of VEGFR-3/VEGFR-2 heterodimers, in which VEGFR-3 was phosphorylated only at three of the five sites while the two most carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues appeared not to be accessible for the VEGFR-2 kinase. Our data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal tail of VEGFR-3 provides important regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation sites with potential signal transduction capacity and that these sites are differentially used in ligand-induced homo- and heterodimeric receptor complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2041922085,"Arginine-rich peptides, penetratins, as part of a number of cellular and viral proteins, can penetrate across plasma membrane directly, without participation of endocytosis. We show that one of penetratins, the basic domain 47-57 of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, transcription factor Tat (Tat peptide), is able to interact with plasmid DNA electrostatically. These interactions result in formation of polyelectrolytic complexes at various negative/positive charge ratios of plasmid DNA and Tat peptide. Plasmid DNA is capable of binding to Tat peptide up to 1.7-fold excess of the complex positive charge. The DNA-Tat complexes can be used for delivery of plasmid DNA into mammalian cells. Transfection efficacy of cultured cells by DNA-Tat complexes is stimulated by free Tat peptide, most likely because it protects DNA-Tat complexes from disruption by anionic proteoglycans of cellular surface. Our data strongly argue in favor of the endocytosis-dependent mechanism of DNA-Tat complex uptake by mammalian cells similarly to internalization of complexes of plasmid DNA with other polycationic carriers. Moreover, different cell lines use different endocytosis-mediated pathways for DNA-Tat complex internalization. Intravenous injections to mice of DNA-Tat complexes in comparison with injections of naked DNA showed an inhibitory effect of DNA-Tat complex positive charge on expression of transferred gene. A low level of foreign gene expression in the liver of mice injected intravenously with positively charged DNA-Tat complexes is accounted for by inactivation of DNA-Tat complexes in the bloodstream due to their interactions with serum albumin.

Arginine-rich peptides, penetratins, as part of a number of cellular and viral proteins, can penetrate across plasma membrane directly, without participation of endocytosis (for review see Refs. 1Schwarze S.R.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Little is known about how penetratins enter the cell. There are data about contacts of the positively charged arginine residues of these peptides with plasma membrane phospholipids. These contacts result in an inversion of lipid bilayer and subsequent penetratin translocation inside the cell (3Berlose J.P. Convert O. Derossi D. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Google Scholar, 4Derossi D. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 84-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). The best characterized penetratins are the basic domain 47-57 of Tat protein (Tat peptide) and a fragment of the third α-helix of the Antennapedia transcription factor homeodomain (1Schwarze S.R. Dowdy S.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 45-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 2Prochaiantz A. Curr. Opin.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 84-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Tat is a small nuclear transcriptional activator protein encoded by human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (for review see Ref. 5Jeang K.-T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The high efficiency and high rate of Tat peptide-mediated cellular internalization have drawn attention of researchers to penetratins as tools for delivery of pharmacological compounds, including high molecular weight proteins, inside cells (1Schwarze S.R. Dowdy S.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 45-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Intravenous injections to mice of bacterial β-galactosidase fused with Tat peptide led to the appearance of active enzyme in different tissues and organs in as early as 20 min after the injection (6Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, several recent reports (7Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vives E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 585-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar, 8Kramer S.D. Wunderli-Allenspach H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have challenged the existence of a special mechanism for the Tat penetratin cellular uptake. The main arguments are as follows: (i) the artificial fluorescent staining of cells treated with labeled penetratins during the cell fixation step; (ii) insufficient washing of treated cells from uninternalized Tat peptide in fluorescence-activated cell sorter experiments (7Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vives E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 585-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar); and (iii) inability of Tat peptide to enter liposomes or intact Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, contrary to earlier observations (8Kramer S.D. Wunderli-Allenspach H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, little is known about particular pathways of Tat peptide entrance into cells, and as usual endocytosis seems to be unable to ensure the rate and efficiency of Tat peptide containing compound internalization (6Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). Development of gene delivery tools for mammals is one of the main approaches in gene therapy. Despite the relatively low efficiency of non-viral carriers of foreign genes in comparison with viral vectors, the former are much more advantageous than the latter with respect to biological inertness, little health risks, and the possibility of repeated administrations. Therefore, the efforts have been continuing to improve properties of these gene carriers. The current non-viral systems of gene transfer are generally based on use of polyelectrolytic complexes of plasmid DNA with polycations, such as cationic lipids, polyethyleneimine, poly-l-lysine, and cationic (lysine-rich) peptides (9Niidome T. Takaji K. Urakawa M. Ohmori O. Wada A. Hirayama T. Aoyagi H. Bioconjugate Chem. 1999; 10: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The latter are now considered to be the most perspective carriers, as they lack toxicity and immunogenicity, as compared with high molecular weight polycations. Despite a number of publications on use of cationic peptides for gene transfer into mammalian cells, very few data have been obtained about the detailed mechanism of internalization of DNA-peptide complexes. Entrance of such complexes into cells appears to be accomplished via different variants of non-receptor-mediated endocytosis (9Niidome T. Takaji K. Urakawa M. Ohmori O. Wada A. Hirayama T. Aoyagi H. Bioconjugate Chem. 1999; 10: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The main limiting factors for effective expression of transferred genes are a rescue of polyelectrolytic DNA-peptide complexes from endosomes and following translocation of those complexes into the nucleus (9Niidome T. Takaji K. Urakawa M. Ohmori O. Wada A. Hirayama T. Aoyagi H. Bioconjugate Chem. 1999; 10: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Gottschalk S. Sparrow J.T. Hauer J. Mims M.P. Leland F.E. Woo S.L. Smith L.C. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 448-457PubMed Google Scholar). Cationic properties of Tat peptide allowed us to assume the following: (i) it might interact with DNA to form polyelectrolytic complexes; (ii) these complexes, by analogy with DNA/lysine-rich peptide ones described earlier (10Gottschalk S.

HIV/AIDS and Related Problems. 2001; 5: 112Google Scholar). Previously, we and others (13Dizhe E.B. Akifiev B.N. Pavlotskaya A.V. Burov S.V. Perevozchikov A.P. Rus. J.

The ability of Tat peptide to enter cells avoiding endocytotic pathways rises the question about the mechanisms of DNA-Tat complex transfer into mammalian cells. Here we show that Tat peptide is able to interact with plasmid DNA electrostatically. These interactions lead to the formation of polyelectrolytic complexes at various negative/positive charge ratios of plasmid DNA and Tat peptide. Our results demonstrate that Tat peptide loses its penetratin properties within the DNA-Tat complexes, most likely through neutralization of positive charges of its arginine residues by the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA. The DNA-Tat complexes enter cells by means of endocytosis, in contrast to cellular uptake of free Tat peptide. The data obtained should be taken into account in an attempt to develop versatile gene delivery systems based on penetratins for therapy of human diseases. Materials—Chemicals used were purchased from Sigma, Fisher, Amersham Biosciences, Roche Applied Science, and from Russian manufacturers (analytical or high purity grade); enzymes for gene engineering were purchased from Fermentas (Lithuania) and Scientific Industrial Corp. SibEnzyme (Russia). Cell Lines—Human hepatoma cells HepG2, Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO1, and buffalo green monkey kidney cells BGM 1The abbreviations used are: BGM, buffalo green monkey; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT, reverse transcriptase. were obtained from the Cell Culture Bank of Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences (Russia). Animals—Mice (strain C57Bl/6, males) used for the in vivo experiments were purchased from the Rappolovo Nursery of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences (Russia). Plasmids—pCMVL (7.8 kbp), the expression vector for bacterial reporter gene lacZ under control of the early human cytomegalovirus gene promoter, was constructed using gene engineering techniques as described previously (16Perevozchikov A.P. Dizhe E.B. Serov S.M. Kuryshev V.Y. Arredouani M. Parfenova N.S. Shavlovskii M.M. Nasonkin I.O. Drapchinskaya N.L. Bondarev I.E. Tsarapkina E.V. Sukonina V.E. Denisenko A.D. Gaitskhoki V.S. Klimov A.N. Mol. Biol. (Moscow). 1997; 31: 216-223PubMed Google Scholar). pCMVluc (4.8 kbp) contains luciferase reporter gene driven by human cytomegalovirus gene promoter. It was constructed from pGL3-basic vector (Promega) and pCMVL. pAlg (15 kbp) containing the 12-kbp fragment of human genomic locus including full apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) gene under control of its own promoter was kindly provided by Dr. L. Chan (Baylor College of Medicine). Peptide Synthesis and Fluorescent Labeling—Lysine-rich peptide K8 (YKAK8WK) (10Gottschalk S. Sparrow J.T. Hauer J. Mims M.P. Leland F.E. Woo S.L. Smith L.C. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 448-457PubMed Google Scholar) and arginine-rich peptide derived from the basic domain of Tat protein (47YGRKKRRQRRR57) (2Prochaiantz A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis, using the tert-butyloxycarbonyl/benzyl strategy by a NPS-4000 semi-automatic synthesizer (Neosystem Laboratoires (France)) on an 4-methylbenzhydrylamine-resin (0.55 mmol/g; 0.25 mmol). To introduce the fluorescent label, the Tat peptide was N-terminally conjugated with 4(5)-carboxyfluorescein, using N,N′-p-diisopropylcarbodiimide/1-hydrobenzotriazole activation in N,N-dimethylformamide (17Weber P.J.A. Bader J.E. Folkers G. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cleavages of peptides from the polymer and simultaneous deprotection were carried out using trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and standard protocol from Applied Biosystems (18Applied Biosystems Inc.Introduction to Cleavage Techniques. Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA1990Google Scholar). Crude peptides were dissolved in 50% acetic acid and passed through a Sephadex G-15 column in 50% acetic acid, and then were purified to homogeneity by preparative high pressure liquid chromatography on a Delta Pak C18 column (Waters, Milford, MA) in an H2O, acetonitrile, 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid system, and their purity was verified by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography. The final products were checked by amino acid analysis and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Preparation of Plasmid DNA-Cationic Peptide Complexes—DNA-peptide complex formations were performed as described earlier (10Gottschalk S. Sparrow J.T. Hauer J. Mims M.P. Leland F.E. Woo S.L. Smith L.C. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 448-457PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Plasmid DNA was purified by ultracentrifugation in CsCl gradient and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) to a concentration of 24 μg/ml. Peptides (K8, Tat, or Tat-F) were dissolved in deionized water (10 mg/ml) immediately before use. To form the DNA-peptide complex, peptide solution was added dropwise to DNA with agitation. Different amounts of peptides were added to obtain charge ratios (positive charges of peptide versus negative charges of DNA) that ranged from 0.3 to 20. To complete complex formation, the reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Determination of DNA/Tat Stoichiometry—To evaluate the maximally possible Tat peptide content in DNA-Tat complexes, these were prepared under a saturating concentration of Tat peptide (10-fold excess of Tat peptide positive charges versus negative DNA ones), as described above. Fifty μg of pCMVL for each experiment was used. The complexes were diluted 20 times with PBS and were purified from unbound peptides by ultrafiltration on Centricon centrifugal filter units YM-10 (Millipore catalog number 4205). To determine the amount of bound Tat peptide in the purified DNA-Tat complex, the calibration curve (dependence of heparin amounts sufficient for complete disruption of DNA-Tat complexes on content of Tat peptide in reaction mixtures) was generated. For this purpose, a series of preliminary EMSAs was performed to determine the amounts of heparin needed for complete disruption of DNA-Tat complexes formed at various charge ratios. Briefly, after completion of complex formation, various amounts of heparin were added, and the mixtures were incubated for 10 min at room temperature followed by EMSAs. DNA content in an aliquot of purified complex was spectrophotometrically determined after DNA displacement from complex by heparin. The total DNA content in the complex was calculated. The amount of Tat peptide in the purified DNA-Tat complex containing 1 μg of DNA was calculated based on the amount of heparin sufficient for complete complex disruption, using the calibration curve described above. The direct stoichiometry study of DNA-Tat complexes was performed by EMSA in 1% agarose gel using 4(5)-carboxyfluorescein-labeled Tat peptide (Tat-F). In some experiments the agarose gel after electrophoresis was soaked with heparin solution for 30 min (58 μg/ml in electrophoretic buffer with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml)) to release DNA from complexes and restore DNA/ethidium bromide fluorescence. Cell Transfection, β-Galactosidase, and Luciferase Assays—HepG2, CHO1, and BGM cells were seeded on 35-mm culture dishes at a density of 1 × 104 cells per cm2 and grown to subconfluent layers in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Calcium phosphate transfection procedure was performed as described elsewhere (19Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar). 12 μg of DNA per dish were used in all experiments. For transfection by means of DNA-peptide complexes, cells were washed three times with serum-free DMEM, and the complexes of DNA-peptide were prepared under various DNA/peptide charge ratios, as described above (12 μg of pCMVL in 500 μl of PBS per dish), with 2 ml of DMEM containing 4 mm CaCl2 added to the cells. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed out from pCMVL-Tat complexes with 1 ml of heparin solution (58 μg/ml in PBS) three times (10 min per each washing) and were supplied with fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. In some experiments, DMEM without CaCl2 was used or a 2-h incubation was performed at +4 °C (see “Results”). The cells were further incubated for 24 h to allow the reporter gene expression. β-Galactosidase assays were performed following the standard protocols, using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside or 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrates. Activity of luciferase was measured on a scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments) by using a luciferase assay system (Promega, catalog number E4030) in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines. Protein concentration in cell lysates was measured by the Bradford assay. Relative β-galactosidase activity was calculated as D 420 optical density per mg of total proteins in cell lysates per 1 h. The luciferase activity is shown in relative light units that correspond to counts/min/mg of total protein in cellular lysates. Fluorescent Microscopy—Exponentially growing cells were seeded on 35-mm plates on a glass coverslip and cultured overnight. The culture medium was discarded, and the cells were washed with PBS. Equal amounts of free Tat-F or pCMVL-Tat-F complex dissolved in 500 ml of PBS were added to the cell monolayer together with 2 ml of fresh Opti-MEM for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were rinsed three times for 10 min with cold PBS containing heparin (58 μg/ml). For direct detection of fluorescein-labeled peptides, cells were mounted in a PBS/glycerol mixture (2:1, v/v) containing antifading reagent. The distribution of fluorescence was analyzed on a Leica TCS SP1 confocal microscope. Quantification of Internalized Tat-F and DNA-Tat-F Complexes—For the quantification experiments HepG2, CHO1, and BGM cells were grown under the same conditions as for transfection procedures (see above). To exclude the presence of free Tat-F in the reaction mixtures, complexes of pCMVL with Tat-F were prepared at Tat/DNA charge ratio of 1:1. Equal amounts of free Tat-F or Tat-F within pCMVL-Tat-F complexes were added to the cells (12 μg of pCMVL per dish in 500 μl of PBS) dissolved in 2 ml of DMEM containing 4 mm CaCl2. The cells were incubated with the peptide-containing medium for 2 h and then washed three times (10 min per washing) with 1 ml of heparin solution (58 μg/ml in PBS) and harvested. The crude cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were obtained as described elsewhere (20Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed by osmotic shock (30 min at 0 °C) in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA) followed by addition of Nonidet P-40 detergent to the final concentration of 0.6%, and additional incubation for 5 min at 0 °C was carried out. Nuclei were precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 s. Supernatant was considered as a cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear fraction was obtained by extraction of nuclear pellet with hypertonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) for 30 min at 0 °C. Nuclear membranes and nuclear matrix were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatant was considered as a nuclear fraction. Fluorescence intensities of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were measured using Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer (model 650-60). Excitation wavelength was set at 460 nm and emission wavelength at 523 nm, with slits of excitation and emission set at 20 and 10 nm, respectively. Treatment of cells with various reagents (sodium azide and nystatin) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) was performed in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C. Prior to addition of free Tat-F or pCMVL-Tat-F complexes, the cells were pretreated with the above-mentioned reagents for 1 h. The internalized Tat-F-peptides and pCMVL-Tat-F complexes were quantified after a 2-h incubation of the cells with Tat-F or DNA-Tat-F complexes in the presence of the reagents. DNA/Ethidium Bromide Fluorescence Restoration Assay—The ability of BSA to restore fluorescence in DNA-Tat complexes was examined as described previously (21Dash P.R. Read M.L. Barrett L.B. Wolfert M.A. Seymour L.W. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) by using Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer (model 650-60). pCMVL-Tat complexes were prepared at DNA/Tat charge ratio of 1:1 as described above. After the complexes were formed they were diluted with PBS containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) to give rise to final DNA concentration of 3.1 μg/ml. Various amounts of BSA were added to the complexes, and mixtures were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The fluorescence was measured by excitation and emission wavelengths at 510 and 595 nm, respectively, with slits of excitation and emission set at 20 and 10 nm, respectively. Interactions of BSA with Tat-F—To study interactions between BSA and Tat-F, BSA was added to Tat-F solution (36 μm) up to a concentration of 3.5 mg/ml. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the probes were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Intravenous Injections of DNA-Tat Complexes to Mice and Analysis of Transferred Gene Expression—To study tissue distribution of DNA-Tat-F complexes and the efficiency of DNA-Tat complex delivery in vivo, complexes of DNA-Tat or DNA-Tat-F in comparison with the naked plasmid DNA (10 μg per animal) or free Tat-F were injected into the mouse tail vein by conventional (slow injection in a small volume (200 μl) of PBS) or hydrodynamics-based (rapid injection in a large volume of PBS) procedures as described previously (22Liu F. Song Y.K. Liu D. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1258-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). 6-8-Week-old C57BL/6 male mice weighing 17-19 g were used. The mice were sacrificed, and their brain, liver, kidney, lung, and spleen were isolated. Crude cytoplasmic fractions were obtained by homogenization of organ samples in 6 volumes of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA) with subsequent incubation for 30 min at 0 °C. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min. Tat-F quantification of obtained cytoplasmic fractions was performed as described above. Expression of human apoA-I gene in the liver of the mice treated with pAlg-Tat complexes was demonstrated by nested RT-PCR performed on total cellular RNA isolated from mouse liver 3 days after administration, using the guanidine isothiocyanate method (23Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar). After digestion with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science), RNA was subjected to reverse transcription, using an oligo(dT) primer and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) to generate first-strand cDNA. The PCR primers were selected by “Primer” software developed by V. Prutkovsky and O. Sokur, Institute of Influenza, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. The outer pair of primers (5′-CCTGGGATCGAGTGAAGGAC-3′ and 5′-CGTGCTCAGATGCTCGGTGG-3′) spans a 522-bp region, and the inner one (5′-CGCCTTGGGAAAACAGCTAA-3′ and 5′-GCTCCATCTCCTCCTGCCAC-3′) spans a 214-bp region of human apoA-I cDNA. Human apoA-I in the mouse sera was determined by the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human apoA-I and secondary goat antibodies to rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Diaminobenzidine was used as a chromogenic substrate. Polyclonal antibodies to human apoA-I were obtained as described earlier (24McVicar J. Kunitake S.T. Hamilton R.L. Kane J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1356-1360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as means ± S.E. The statistical analyses of differences between compared groups were performed using a non-paired t test. Differences were considered statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level. All statistical analyses were performed using the program Statistica 5.0, StatSoft, Inc. Tat peptide electrostatically interacts with plasmid DNA by forming polyelectrolytic complexes that are able to penetrate into mammalian cells. Tat peptide is able to form polyelectrolytic complexes with plasmid DNA at the physiological level of ionic strength and at various DNA/Tat charge ratios, as confirmed by EMSA (data not shown). To test the ability of those complexes to transform cultured mammalian cells, we performed transfection of human hepatoma cells HepG2 by β-galactosidase expression vector pCMVL complexed with Tat peptide in comparison with a standard calcium phosphate transfection procedure (Fig. 1, a and b). Transfection efficiency by pCMVL-Tat complexes (about 12%) was found to be compatible with one obtained by the calcium phosphate technique. In parallel experiments, HepG2 cells were transfected with preformed complexes pCMVL-K8 known to be effectively used for cell transfection (10Gottschalk S. Sparrow J.T. Hauer J. Mims M.P. Leland F.E. Woo S.L. Smith L.C. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 448-457PubMed Google Scholar) or with pCMVL-Tat (Fig. 1c). These results demonstrate that Tat peptide is able to transfer pCMVL into cells as efficiently as K8. The transfection efficiency is enhanced when the complexes are prepared at the cationic peptide charge excess versus the DNA anionic charge. The maximal transfection level was achieved with pCMVL-Tat complexes prepared at a 1:5 negative/positive charge ratio. Further elevation of Tat amounts used for the complex formation leads to a decrease of transfection efficiency (Fig. 1d). To study the stoichiometry of positively charged pCMVL-Tat complexes, interactions of DNA with Tat peptide were carried out at the 10-fold excess of the Tat peptide positive charge versus the DNA negative one. After purification of the formed complex from unbound Tat peptide by ultrafiltration, the pCMVL-Tat complex containing the maximal possible amount of Tat was obtained. Tat peptide content in the complex was measured by heparin reverse titration (Fig. 2, a and b), whereas DNA content was determined after complete complex disruption by heparin (see “Experimental Procedures”). The plasmid DNA was found to be capable of binding to Tat peptide up to 1.7-fold the complex positive charge excess. These results were confirmed by EMSA of DNA-Tat-F complexes prepared at various DNA/Tat peptide ratios (Fig. 2c). Formation of complexes at DNA/Tat peptide charge ratios lower than 1:1.7 leads to detection of free Tat-F in reactio"

https://openalex.org/W2076040549,"The electronic structure of PuO(2+/-x) was studied using first-principles quantum mechanics, realized with the self-interaction corrected local spin density method. In the stoichiometric PuO2 compound, Pu occurs in the Pu(IV) oxidation state, corresponding to a localized f4 shell. If oxygen is introduced onto the octahedral interstitial site, the nearby Pu atoms turn into Pu(V) (f3) by transferring electrons to the oxygen. Oxygen vacancies cause Pu(III) (f5) to form by taking up electrons released by oxygen. At T = 0, the PuO2 compound is stable with respect to free oxygen, but the delicate energy balance suggests the possible deterioration of the material during long-term storage."

https://openalex.org/W2061831020,"The p53 tumor suppressor is frequently inactivated in tumors by point mutations in the DNA-binding domain, resulting in loss of sequence-specific DNA binding and transcription function. We present evidence that ellipticine can restore the transactivation function of several transfected p53 mutants (175 H, 248W, 249S, 273 H, 281G), resulting in the induction of p53-responsive genes (p21(WAF1),MDM2) and activation of a p53-responsive luciferase reporter. Ellipticine also activates mutant p53 function in tumor cells expressing endogenous 194F, 233L, 241F, and 273C mutants. Treatment with ellipticine alters mutant p53 reactivity to conformation-sensitive Pab1620 and Pab240 antibodies and increases its sequence-specific DNA-binding activity in vivo. Finally, ellipticine activates mutant p53 and induces p21(WAF1) and MDM2 expression in nude mouse tumor xenografts. These results demonstrate that ellipticine can restore transcription function to mutant p53. This property may contribute to the selectivity of ellipticine-derived compounds against tumor cell lines expressing mutant p53."
https://openalex.org/W1977937744,"The SLIT family of genes consists of large extracellular matrix-secreted and membrane-associated glycoproteins. The Slits (Slit1-3) are ligands for the repulsive guidance receptors, the robo gene family. The Slit-Robo interactions mediate the repulsive cues on axons and growth cones during neural development. In a recent report, we demonstrated that promoter region CpG island of human SLIT2 was frequently hypermethylated in lung, breast and colorectal tumours and the silenced gene transcript suppressed the malignant phenotype in in vitro assays. In this report we undertook epigenetic, genetic and expression analysis of SLIT2 gene in a large series of gliomas and glioma cell lines. Promoter region CpG island of SLIT2 was found to be methylated in 71% (5/7) of glioma cell lines and was unmethylated in five DNA samples from normal brain tissues. The hypermethylation of the SLIT2 promoter region in glioma cell lines correlated with loss of expression and treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine reactivated SLIT2 gene expression. In primary gliomas, SLIT2 was methylated in 59% (37/63) of tumours analysed. In addition, SLIT2 expression was downregulated in methylated gliomas relative to unmethylated tumour samples, as demonstrated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Loss of heterozygosity analysis revealed that SLIT2 methylated gliomas retained both alleles of a microsatellite marker within 100 kb of the SLIT2 gene at 4p15.2. Exogenous expression of SLIT2 in a glioma cell line that was heavily methylated for SLIT2 decreased in vitro colony formation. Our data indicate that SLIT2 is frequently inactivated by promoter region CpG island hypermethylation in gliomas and may be a good candidate for a glioma tumour suppressor gene (TSG) located at 4p15.2. Furthermore, our data suggest that a detailed analysis of both the cancer genome and epigenome will be required to identify key TSGs involved in glioma development."
https://openalex.org/W2023541920,"Enhanced expression of both integrin alpha v beta 3 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFr) has been described in glioblastoma tumors. We therefore explored the possibility that integrin alpha v beta 3 cooperates with PDGFr to promote cell migration in glioblastoma cells, and extended the study to identify the Src family members that are activated on PDGF stimulation. Glioblastoma cells utilize integrins alpha v beta 3 and alpha v beta 5 to mediate vitronectin attachment. We found that physiologic PDGF stimulation (83 pm, 10 min) of vitronectin-adherent cells promoted the specific recruitment of integrin alpha v beta 3-containing focal adhesions to the cell cortex and alpha v beta 3-mediated cell motility. Analysis of PDGFr immunoprecipitates indicated an association of the PDGFr beta with integrin alpha v beta 3, but not integrin alpha v beta 5. Cells plated onto collagen or laminin, which engage different integrins, exhibited significantly less migration on PDGF stimulation, indicating a cooperation of alpha v beta 3 and the PDGFr beta in glioblastoma cells that promotes migration. Further analysis of the cells plated onto vitronectin indicated that PDGF stimulation caused an increase in Src kinase activity, which was associated with integrin alpha v beta 3. In the vitronectin-adherent cells, Lyn was associated preferentially with alpha v beta 3 both in the presence and absence of PDGF stimulation. In contrast, Fyn was associated with both alpha v beta 3 and alpha v beta 5. Moreover, PDGF stimulation increased the activity of Lyn, but not Fyn, in vitronectin-adherent cells, and the activity of Fyn, but not Lyn, in laminin-adherent cells. Using cells attached to mAb anti-alpha v beta 3 or mAb anti-integrin alpha 6, we confirmed the activation of specific members of the Src kinase family with PDGF stimulation. Down-regulation of Lyn expression by siRNA significantly inhibited the cell migration mediated by integrin alpha v beta 3 in PDGF-stimulated cells, demonstrating the PDGFr beta cooperates with integrin alpha v beta 3 in promoting the motility of vitronectin-adherent glioblastoma cells through a Lyn kinase-mediated pathway. Notably, the data indicate that engagement of different integrins alters the identity of the Src family members that are activated on stimulation with PDGF."
https://openalex.org/W1970121621,"Transcription from the ASNS (asparagine synthetase) gene is increased in response to either amino acid (amino acid response) or glucose (endoplasmic reticulum stress response) deprivation. These two independent pathways converge on the same set of genomic cis-elements within the ASNS promoter, referred to as nutrient-sensing response element-1 and -2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis provides the first in vivo evidence for activating transcription factor (ATF)-3 binding to the proximal ASNS promoter containing the nutrient-sensing response element-1 sequence. Overexpression of the full-length ATF3 protein caused a concentration-dependent biphasic response in ASNS promoter-driven transcription. Both amino acid limitation and activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response by glucose deprivation caused an increase in ATF3 mRNA content. However, reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed that the increase in the ATF3 mRNA species detected by Northern analysis actually encoded both full-length ATF3 and two predicted truncated ATF3 isoforms (ATF3ΔZip2c and ATF3ΔZip3). Based on sequence analysis, one of the predicted truncated proteins (ATF3ΔZip3) is likely incapable of binding DNA; and yet, exogenous expression of the cDNA enhanced starvation-induced or ATF4-activated ASNS transcription, possibly by sequestering corepressor proteins.

ASNS (asparagine synthetase) encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the glutamine- and ATP-dependent conversion of aspartic acid to asparagine (1Richards N.G.J. Schuster S.M. Adv. Enzymol. 1998; 72: 145-198PubMed Google Scholar). ASNS expression in mammalian tissues is highly regulated by the nutritional status of the cells.

Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells have evolved complex responses to cell stress, and these responses often serve as a protective function. The up-regulation of ASNS transcription upon nutrient stress suggests that ASNS is a critical cellular defense gene, although the exact roles of ASNS and the molecular mechanisms for activation have not been extensively investigated. Therefore, characterization of the transcriptional regulation of the ASNS gene following amino acid deprivation will not only provide information on the cellular mechanisms for reacting to amino acid limitation (3Gong S.S.

Together, NSRE-1 and NSRE-2 function as an enhancer in that transcriptional activity is orientation- and location-independent, and they can transfer amino acid responsiveness to a heterologous promoter (9Zhong C. Chen C. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In vitro binding experiments and overexpression of specific transcription factors and their dominant-negative mutants have demonstrated that activation of the ASNS gene involves activating transcription factor (ATF)-4 (10Siu F.

ATF3 is expressed at low levels in normal and quiescent cells, but can be rapidly induced in response to diverse extracellular stress signals and might be involved in controlling a wide variety of cellular activities (12Chen B.P. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 13Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2398-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing within the ATF3 gene is known to occur, and truncated ATF3 isoforms have been reported (14Hashimoto Y. Zhang C. Kawauchi J. Imoto I. Adachi M.T. Inazawa J. Amagasa T. Hai T. Kitajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2398-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Chen B.P. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to full-length ATF3 (ATF3-FL), which forms homodimers and, in this way, functions as a transcriptional repressor (13Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar), the truncated isoforms (ATF3ΔZip, ATF3ΔZip2a, and ATF3ΔZip2b) can function as transcriptional activators (14Hashimoto Y. Zhang C. Kawauchi J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activation is thought to occur because the truncated ATF3ΔZip isoforms lack the leucine zipper dimerization and DNA-binding domains, but retain the binding site for ATF3-associated corepressors. Therefore, increased expression of these isoforms causes gene activation indirectly by sequestering corepressor complexes. Further evidence for this hypothesis comes from the observation that the ATF3ΔZip isoform can activate promoters lacking an ATF3-binding site (15Chen B.P. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell signal mechanisms for regulation of the splicing events that determine which ATF3 isoforms are produced are unknown. The lengths of the mRNA species encoding the full-length and truncated ATF3 proteins are not sufficiently different to permit ready detection by conventional Northern blotting, so reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR is required to distinguish them (14Hashimoto Y. Zhang C. Kawauchi J. Imoto I. Adachi M.T. Inazawa J. Amagasa T. Hai T. Kitajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2398-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Our data from HepG2 hepatoma cells show that ATF3 mRNA content is increased by either amino acid or glucose deprivation, but that the induced mRNA contains multiple sequences that arise from alternative splicing. When translated, these mRNA species would encode multiple ATF3 isoforms, including two newly identified truncated proteins (ATF3ΔZip2c and ATF3ΔZip3). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments established that ATF3-FL bound to the proximal ASNS promoter containing the NSRE-1 sequence in vivo. Overexpression of ATF3-FL caused a biphasic response. Low plasmid concentrations resulted in a further enhancement of transcription from the ASNS promoter mediated by ATF4, but high plasmid concentrations caused an antagonism of the action of ATF4. Expression of the ATF3ΔZip2c cDNA in HepG2 cells had no detectable effect on ASNS promoter-driven transcription. In contrast, transfection of the cDNA for the other newly identified variant, ATF3ΔZip3, enhanced starvation-induced transcription mediated by ATF4 in a concentration-dependent manner.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Human HepG2 hepatoma cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM; Mediatech, Herndon, VA) (pH 7.4) supplemented to contain the recommended amount of the manufacturer's nonessential amino acid solution, 4 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 95% air incubator. Given that ASNS promoter expression is induced by nutrient depletion, cell cultures were replenished with fresh MEM and serum 12 h prior to initiating all treatments. Nutrient deprivation was performed by incubating the cells for 12 h in complete MEM, in MEM lacking histidine or glucose, or in MEM containing 5 μg/ml tunicamycin or 300 nm thapsigargin. All treatment media contained 5% dialyzed FBS during the 12-h treatment.Northern Analysis—HepG2 cells (2.65 × 106 cells) were seeded on 60-mm dishes for 24 h; given fresh MEM for an additional 12 h before treatment; and then transferred to fresh complete MEM, glucose-free MEM, or histidine-free MEM for 12 h, each supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS. To address the role of transcription or translation during amino acid starvation, actinomycin (5 μm) or cycloheximide (100 μm) was added to parallel dishes. Total cellular RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) following the supplier's recommendations. For Northern analysis, 15 μg of RNA was size-fractionated and capillary-transferred to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) as described (7Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31139-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 32P-Radiolabeled cDNA probe synthesis for ATF3 and ribosomal protein L7a was performed as described (16Aslanian A.M. Fletcher B.S. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Following hybridization and washing, the blots were exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.), and the results were quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The pCG-ATF3 vector, which contains a cDNA for ATF3-FL under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, was generously provided by Dr. Tsonwin Hai (Ohio State University). The ATF3 cDNA probe was generated by restriction enzyme digestion of pCG-ATF3 using XbaI and BamHI.Identification of Multiple ATF3 mRNA Species by RT-PCR—HepG2 cells (2.65 × 106 cells) were seeded on 60-mm dishes for 24 h; given fresh MEM for an additional 12 h; and then transferred for 12 h to fresh complete MEM or to histidine-free MEM, each supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS. Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted using Concert™ cytoplasmic RNA reagent (Invitrogen) to eliminate DNA and hnRNA contaminants according to the procedure recommended by the supplier. ATF3 sequences were amplified by the QIAGEN one-step RT-PCR kit. The RT reaction was performed at 50 °C for 30 min, followed by 95 °C for 15 min, to activate HotStarTaq DNA polymerase and to inactivate the RT. For ATF3-FL, PCR was performed at 95 °C for 60 s, 58 °C for 90 s, and 72 °C for 120 s for 30 cycles. In contrast, the amplification temperature for the alternatively spliced mRNA species was 60 °C. The primers used to amplify ATF3-FL were the 5′-primer (5′-ATGATGCTTCAACACCCAGGC-3′) and the 3′-primer (5′-TTAGCTCTGCAATGTTCCTTC-3′). The primers used to amplify the ATF3ΔZip2c and ATF3ΔZip3 mRNAs were the 5′-primer (5′-ATGATGCTTCAACACCCAGGC-3′) and the Zip3 primer (5′-GCTCATCAAGCTGCGAGAGG-3′), as originally chosen by Hashimoto et al. (14Hashimoto Y. Zhang C. Kawauchi J. Imoto I. Adachi M.T. Inazawa J. Amagasa T. Hai T. Kitajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2398-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The PCR amplification products were subcloned into the TOPO-TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing.To measure the relative amount of the three different ATF3 mRNA species, quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed using a DNA Engine Opticon 2 system (MJ Research, Inc., Reno, NV) and detection with SYBR green I. The reactions were incubated at 50 °C for 30 min, followed by 95 °C for 15 min to activate the polymerase and amplification at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s for 35 cycles. After PCR, melting curves were acquired by stepwise increases in the temperature from 55 to 95 °C to ensure that a single product was amplified in the reaction. Samples from at least three independent time courses were analyzed.Transient Transfection and Expression—The rat ATF4 cDNA, generously provided by Dr. Jawed Alam (Ochsner Clinic Foundation, New Orleans, LA) (17He C.H. Gong P. Hu B. Stewart D. Choi M.E. Choi A.M. Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), was cloned into the pcDNA3.1/myc-his(–) vector (Invitrogen), and its expression was driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. All ATF3 cDNAs used for expression studies were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/zeo (Invitrogen) to generate the ATF3 expression vectors driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. The ASNS –173/+51 promoter/Luc reporter plasmid was made by inserting nucleotides –173 to +51 of the ASNS promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene using the HindIII site of the pGL3 plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). HepG2 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were seeded on 24-well plates 18 –24 h before transfection with Superfect reagent (QIAGEN Inc.) at a ratio of 6 μl of Superfect to 1 μg of DNA. For each transfection, 0.5 μg of the ASNS –173/+51 promoter/Luc plasmid was used along with the indicated amounts of the transcription factor expression plasmids. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant among experimental groups by the addition of empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid. Eighteen hours following transfection, the cells were transferred to fresh complete MEM containing 5% dialyzed FBS for 12 h before preparing cell extracts for analysis of luciferase activity. To prepare the extract, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). The lysates were collected and stored at –80 °C until used. Twenty microliters of cell extract was used for firefly luciferase assays using the luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), and luminescence was measured with a luminometer. The luciferase activity measured in each assay was normalized to the protein concentration in the corresponding cell lysate. At least three independent transfections were performed for each experimental condition, and all experiments were repeated with separate batches of cells.ChIP Analysis—ChIP analysis was performed following the protocol of Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were seeded at 2 × 107/150-mm dish, grown for 24 h, transferred to fresh MEM for 12 h, and then treated either in complete MEM or in MEM lacking histidine for 5 h. Protein-DNA cross-linking was initiated by adding formaldehyde directly to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1% and stopped 10 min later by adding 2 m glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Sonication was performed using a Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher) for five bursts at power 9 for 40 s with 2 min cooling on ice between each burst. Extract equaling 1 × 10 7 HepG2 cells was incubated with 2 or 4 μg of either rabbit anti-chicken IgG or rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus of ATF3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and then the antibody-bound complex was precipitated by protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA fragments in the immunoprecipitated complex were released by reversing the cross-linking at 65 °C for 4 h and purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN Inc.). Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using primers designed by Vector NTI Version 7.1 software (InforMax Inc., Frederick, MD) to amplify ASNS genomic sequence –87 to –22 (human ASNS-87F primer, 5′-TGGTTGGTCCTCGCAGGCAT-3′; and human ASNS-22R primer, 5′-CGCTTATACCGACCTGGCTCCT-3′). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed using the DNA Engine Opticon 2 system and detection with SYBR green I. The PCRs were set up in a reaction volume of 25 μl. 2-Fold serial dilutions of input chromatin were used to generate a standard curve for determining the relative amount of products. The standards and the samples in duplicate were simultaneously amplified using the same reaction master mixture. The reactions were incubated at 95 °C for 15 min to activate the polymerase, followed by amplification at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s for 35 cycles. After PCR, melting curves were acquired by stepwise increases in the temperature from 55 to 95 °C to ensure that a single product was amplified in the reaction. The results are expressed as -fold induction over the control sample. Samples from at least three independent immunoprecipitations were analyzed.Immunoblotting—Total cell extracts (30 μg/sample) were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to a Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). The membrane was stained with fast green to check for equal loading between lanes and then incubated with 5% blocking solution (5% (w/v) Carnation nonfat dry milk, 30 mm Tris base (pH 7.5), 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and 200 mm NaCl) for 2 h at room temperature on a rotator. Immunoblotting was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus of ATF3 at a concentration of 0.2 μg/ml in 5% blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were washed for 5 × 5 min with 1% blocking solution on a shaker and then incubated with peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) at a 1:20,000 dilution for 45 min at room temperature. The blots were then washed for 5 × 5 min with 1% blocking solution and for 2 × 5 min with 30 mm Tris base, 0.05% Tween 20, and 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.5). The bound secondary antibody was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Biomax MR film.RESULTSTwo separate cis-elements, NSRE-1 and NSRE-2, are both required for induction of the ASNS gene in response to activation of the amino acid response or ERSR pathway (8Barbosa-Tessmann I.P.

The NSRE-1 sequence has been shown to bind both ATF4 and C/EBPβ (10Siu F. Bain P.J. LeBlanc-Chaffin R. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol.

During the course of the previous studies, unpublished electrophoresis mobility shift assay experiments revealed a small but reproducible amount of ATF3 binding to the NSRE-1 complex. The experiments described below extend those initial observations and investigate the regulatory role of ATF3 in ASNS gene expression.ATF3-FL Modulates ASNS Promoter Activity—To determine whether ATF3-FL expression alters ASNS promoter activity, HepG2 cells were transiently cotransfected with the ASNS –173/+51 promoter/Luc reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of an ATF3-FL expression plasmid. After 36 h, the cells were transferred to complete MEM or to MEM lacking either histidine or glucose for 12 h prior to isolation of extracts for measurement of luciferase activity (Fig. 1). ASNS promoter-driven luciferase activity was increased in both the histidine-deprived (∼6 times control) and glucose-deprived (>2 times control) cells without exogenous ATF3 expression. Expression of ATF3-FL (0.5 μg of DNA/2 × 105 cells) caused an 80% inhibition of the basal (MEM) luciferase activity and a complete inhibition of enhanced luciferase activity following either histidine or glucose deprivation (Fig. 1A). These data indicate that, at relatively high expression levels, ATF3-FL can serve as a strong repressor of both basal and regulated ASNS expression, consistent with its known action on other genes (18Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6700-6707Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 19Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar).ATF3 mRNA Content Is Increased by Either Amino Acid or Glucose Deprivation—To determine whether or not the expression of ATF3 itself might be increased by amino acid or glucose deprivation, HepG2 cells were incubated in complete MEM or in MEM lacking either histidine or glucose for 12 h. Total RNA was isolated for measurement of ATF3 mRNA content by Northern analysis (Fig. 1B). ATF3 mRNA content was increased to ∼6 times the control value (MEM) if histidine was deleted from the culture medium and to ∼4 times the control value following glucose deprivation. The presence of increased ATF3-FL protein was also documented using antibody raised against the C terminus and thus specific for the full-length protein (Fig. 1C).To investigate whether or not ATF3 is induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress stimuli other than glucose deprivation, HepG2 cells were treated for 1–8 h with either tunicamycin (5 μg/ml) or thapsigargin (300 nm), both of which cause ER stress by inhibiting protein N-glycosylation and ER Ca2+-ATPase, respectively (Fig. 2). ATF3 mRNA was increased to ∼7 times the control value only 1 h after treating the cells with thapsigargin, whereas the increase in ATF3 mRNA following tunicamycin or glucose deprivation was significantly delayed. These results are consistent with earlier reports demonstrating that the ATF3 gene is activated by a variety of stress responses (13Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2Time course of ATF3 mRNA content following ER stress. HepG2 cells were incubated for 0–18 h in MEM, in MEM containing tunicamycin (Tm; 5 μg/ml) or thapsigargin (Tg; 300 nm), or in MEM lacking glucose. At the times indicated, RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern analysis (20 μg of RNA/lane) for ATF3 or ribosomal protein L7a mRNA content. The data were quantified and are expressed as a ratio of the value obtained for ribosomal protein L7a. The results shown in the gel represent a typical blot, and the graph illustrates the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Where not shown, the error bars are contained with the symbol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test the role of de novo RNA synthesis in the ATF3 mRNA increase, HepG2 cells were histidine-deprived in the presence or absence of 5 μm actinomycin D, and then total RNA was analyzed for ATF3 mRNA content, with ASNS mRNA serving as a positive control (Fig. 3). The ATF3 mRNA content was detectably increased within 1 h of histidine depletion and reached a maximum value of ∼18 times the control (MEM) at 6 h (Fig. 3B). Consistent with a possible regulatory role of ATF3 in the ASNS gene, the ASNS mRNA content lagged behind the ATF3 mRNA content and was not increased until 3 h after removing histidine from the medium, reaching a value of ∼16 times the control at 12 h (Fig. 3C). Inhibition of de novo RNA synthesis by actinomycin D completely prevented the increase in ATF3 mRNA accumulation in response to amino acid limitation, indicative of transcriptional control by stress stimuli (13Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). ASNS mRNA accumulation was also completely prevented by actinomycin D, consistent with its known transcriptional regulation by amino acid limitation (2Kilberg M.S. Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). If ATF3 represents an upstream step in ASNS gene regulation, it is of mechanistic interest to determine whether the nutrient deprivation-induced expression of ATF3 mRNA requires newly synthesized proteins. The increase in ATF3 mRNA in response to amino acid limitation was completely insensitive to blocking protein synthesis by cycloheximide, suggesting that the necessary regulatory proteins were present prior to nutrient deprivation (data not shown).Fig. 3Induction of ATF3 and ASNS mRNA content by histidine deprivation requires de novo RNA synthesis. HepG2 cells were incubated for 0–12 h in MEM or in MEM lacking histidine in the presence or absence of 5 μm actinomycin D (ActD). At the times indicated, RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern analysis (20 μg of RNA/lane) for ATF3, ASNS, or ribosomal protein L7a mRNA content. The data were quantified and are expressed as a ratio of the value obtained for ribosomal protein L7a. The results shown in A represent a typical blot, and the graphs for ATF3 (B) and ASNS (C) illustrate the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification and Analysis of Predicted ATF3 Isoforms—As described in the Introduction, certain cell types express truncated ATF3 isoforms (14Hashimoto Y.

https://openalex.org/W2042629891,"Upon encountering macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), human monocytes undergo a series of cellular signaling events leading to an increase in Akt activity. However, the regulation of these events is not completely understood. Because the inositol 5′-phosphatase SHIP-1 is an important regulator of intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, an important second messenger necessary for Akt activation, we hypothesized that SHIP-1 was involved in the regulation of M-CSF receptor (M-CSF-R)-induced Akt activation. In the human monocytic cell line, THP-1, SHIP-1 became tyrosine-phosphorylated following M-CSF activation in a Src family kinase-dependent manner. Transfection of 3T3-Fms cells, which express the human M-CSF-R, with wild-type SHIP-1 showed that SHIP-1 was necessary for the negative regulation of M-CSF-induced Akt activation. In THP-1 cells, SHIP-1 bound Lyn, independent of the kinase activity of Lyn, following M-CSF activation. Utilizing a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, we found that SHIP-1 bound to Lyn via the SHIP-1 Src homology 2 domain. Furthermore, transfection of THP-1 cells with a wild-type SHIP-1 construct reduced NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation of a reporter gene, whereas a SHIP-1 Src homology 2 domain construct resulted in an increase in NF-κB activation. Additionally, in 3T3-Fms cells, Lyn enhanced the ability of SHIP-1 to regulate Akt activation by stabilizing SHIP-1 at the cellular membrane. Finally, macrophages isolated from both SHIP-1- and Lyn-deficient mice exhibited enhanced Akt phosphorylation following M-CSF stimulation. These data provide the first evidence of the involvement of both SHIP-1 and Lyn in the negative regulation of M-CSF-R-induced Akt activation.

However, the process by which M-CSF induces monocyte survival and/or differentiation into macrophages and the signaling proteins that function as negative regulators of these events are not completely understood. The M-CSF receptor (M-CSF-R) is a receptor tyrosine kinase, in vivo expression of which is limited to monocytes, macrophages, proliferating smooth muscle cells, and cells of the female reproductive tract (6Inaba T. Yamada N. Gotoda T. Shimano H. Shimada M. Momomura K. Kadowaki T. Motoyoshi K. Tsukada T. Morisaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5693-5699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Arceci R.J.

Upon binding its ligand, M-CSF, the receptor dimerizes and undergoes auto- and trans-phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. These tyrosine residues, based upon the human M-CSF-R protein sequence, include tyrosine 561 (Tyr-561), Tyr-699, Tyr-708, Tyr-723, and Tyr-809, and bind specific signaling proteins once they become phosphorylated (8Alonso G.

We have previously shown that the M-CSF-R activates the serine/threonine kinase Akt in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner to promote cellular survival (18Kelley T.W. Graham M.M. Doseff A.I.

The activation of PI 3-kinase converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), leading to increased levels of the second messenger PI(3,4,5)P3. The SH2 domain-containing inositol 5′-phosphatase, SHIP-1, acts as a negative regulator of Akt phosphorylation by dephosphorylating PI(3,4,5)P3 to PI(3,4)P2 (19Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P.

SHIP-1 was first characterized as an ∼145-kDa protein that became tyrosine-phosphorylated upon interleukin-3 stimulation of a murine hematopoietic cell line (19Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that SHIP-1 has several alternatively spliced isoforms, including 135, 125, and 110 kDa (22Damen J.E. Liu L. Ware M.D. Ermolaeva M. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Blood. 1998; 92: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lucas D.M. Rohrschneider L.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 1922-1933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, SHIP-1 was shown to be involved in the negative regulation of B-cell and IgE receptor signaling (24D'Ambrosio D. Fong D.C. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 54: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 25Fong D.C. Malbec O. Arock M. Cambier J.C. Fridman W.H. Daeron M. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 54: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A related gene product to SHIP-1 was also identified and was named SHIP-2 (26Pesesse X. Deleu S. De Smedt F. Drayer L. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). SHIP-2 is characterized by the same 5′-phosphatase activity as SHIP-1. However, whereas both SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 hydrolyze PI(3,4,5)P3 in vitro, only SHIP-1 hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate (27Wisniewski D. Strife A. Swendeman S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Kavanaugh W.M. Tempst P. Clarkson B. Blood. 1999; 93: 2707-2720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, unlike SHIP-1, which is limited to cells of the hematopoietic lineage, SHIP-2 is predominantly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle and the placenta, and differs from SHIP-1 in both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions (26Pesesse X. Deleu S. De Smedt F. Drayer L. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 28Habib T. Hejna J.A. Moses R.E. Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18605-18609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). SHIP-1 has been extensively studied in B-cells, T-cells, and mast cells. However, little attention has been placed on the involvement of SHIP-1 in monocytes and the specific mechanisms used by this phosphatase to regulate M-CSF-induced cellular signaling. Recently, the Src kinase Lyn has been shown to directly phosphorylate SHIP-1 both in vitro and in vivo (29Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19090-19097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance of this phosphorylation remains unclear. Specifically, there is no clear consensus on whether the tyrosine phosphorylation affects either its enzymatic activity or its localization to the plasma membrane. However, membrane targeting of this phosphatase is critical, as the main target of SHIP-1, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, is located in the plasma membrane. Because SHIP-1-deficient mice exhibit hyperplasia of myeloid cells and M-CSF is important in myeloid cell homeostasis, we hypothesized that SHIP-1 was involved in the regulation of M-CSF-induced cellular signaling in monocytes and sought to define the mechanism of this regulation. Here we report that SHIP-1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon M-CSF activation of THP-1 cells, and this phosphorylation occurred in a Src family kinase-dependent manner. Transfection of 3T3-Fms cells with WT SHIP-1 demonstrated the importance of SHIP-1 in regulating M-CSF-induced Akt activation. Additionally, following M-CSF stimulation of THP-1 cells, SHIP-1 associated with the Src kinase Lyn. This association occurred via the SH2 domain of SHIP-1, and was independent of the kinase activity of Lyn. WT SHIP-1 reduced NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation of a reporter gene in M-CSF-activated THP-1 cells. Furthermore, in 3T3-Fms cells, Lyn enhanced the ability of SHIP-1 to regulate Akt activation by promoting the localization of SHIP-1 to the membrane. Finally, macrophages isolated from both SHIP-1 or Lyn-deficient mice exhibited enhanced Akt phosphorylation after M-CSF stimulation in comparison to macrophages isolated from wild-type mice. These data provide the first evidence of the involvement of both Lyn and SHIP-1 in M-CSF-R signaling, leading to a new paradigm regarding SHIP-1 activation, phosphorylation, and stability at the cell membrane. Cells—The THP-1 cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. NIH/3T3-Fms cells were a kind gift from Dr. Martine Roussel (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) and were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen).

All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Macrophage Isolation and Culture—Femoral and tibial bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) were obtained from C57/BL6 wild-type and SHIP-1-deficient mice (30Helgason C.D. Damen J.E. Rosten P. Grewal R. Sorensen P. Chappel S.M. Borowski A. Jirik F. Krystal G. Humphries R.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1610-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), and 129/Sv wild-type and Lyn-deficient mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). Bone marrow progenitor cells were flushed out with ice-cold RPMI and then plated in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 10 μg/ml polymyxin B, and 20 ng/ml M-CSF. Cells were cultured in a 37 °C incubator for 5 days with addition of fresh M-CSF each day. Adherent mononuclear phagocytes were attached to the bottom of the plates and differentiated to macrophages. Those BMM were serum-starved for 24 h at 37 °C before re-stimulation with 100 ng/ml M-CSF. Cells were lysed in Akt A buffer (50 mm Tris (pH = 7.5), 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 3 mm Na3VO4, 5 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin), and cell lysates were quantitated using the Bio-Rad DC assay (Hercules, CA) and used for Western analysis. M-CSF Stimulation—THP-1 cells or NIH/3T3-Fms cells were serumstarved on ice for 4.5 h in RPMI 1640 or DMEM without fetal bovine serum. Cells were then supplemented with 100 ng/ml M-CSF and incubated at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed in 1 ml of TN1 lysis buffer (125 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH = 8.0), 10 mm EDTA (pH = 8.0), 10 mm Na4P2O7 ·10H2O, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 3 mm Na3VO4, 5 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) and centrifuged, and supernatants were used for analysis. Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—THP-1 cells or BMM lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C. 20 μl of a 50% suspension of Protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) was added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were then washed two times in 1 ml of lysis buffer, resuspended in 45 μl of SDS-loading buffer (30 mm Tris (pH = 6.8), 2.3% SDS, 0.01% w/v bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol), and boiled for 5 min. Samples were separated via 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked in TBS (pH = 7.75) supplemented with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) for 20 min at room temperature. Membranes were immunoblotted in TBS (pH = 7.75) supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. Blots were thoroughly washed in TBS + 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with 0.6 μg of the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody at room temperature for 12 min. Blots were then thoroughly washed in TBS + 0.1% Tween 20 and were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). GST Fusion Protein Pull-down Experiments—THP-1 cells were treated with or without 100 ng/ml M-CSF, lysed in 1 ml of TN1 lysis buffer, and incubated with 10 μg of the GST-SHIP-1 SH2 domain or GST alone and 50 μl of a slurry of glutathione-Sepharose. Samples were rocked overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed two times with TN1 lysis buffer and treated in the same manner for Western blotting as described above. Inhibitors—2 μg/ml amounts of PP2 or PP3 or an equivalent volume of Me2SO (vehicle control) were added to THP-1 cells in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and incubated at room temperature for 15 min prior to stimulation with M-CSF. Plasmids—NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and pEGFP was purchased from Clontech. Wild-type SHIP-1 and the SHIP-1 SH2 domain cloned into pCDNA3 were a generous gift from Dr. K. Mark Coggeshall (Oklahoma Medical Research Facility, Oklahoma City, OK). WT Lyn cloned into pcDNA3 was a kind from Dr. Henry Metzger (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The GST-AKT construct was a kind gift from Dr. R. B. Pearson (Trescowthick Research Laboratories, Melbourne, Australia). Transfection of THP-1 Cells and Luciferase Assays—THP-1 cells were transfected by electroporation (310 V, 950 microfarads; Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II) with 20 μg of wild-type SHIP-1 or SHIP-1 SH2 domain, 5 μg of NF-κB-luc plasmid, and 2 μg of pEGFP to normalize for transfection efficiency. Transfectants were harvested 24 h later and activated by adding M-CSF for 6 h at 37 °C. The cells were lysed in 100 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using the Promega luciferase assay reagent. Transfection of NIH/3T3-Fms Cells—Cells were seeded to ∼70% confluence 24 h prior to transfection in 100-mm tissue culture dishes. On the day of transfection, cells were incubated with 1.5 μg of WT SHIP-1 and 0.5 μg of GST-Akt (to normalize for transfection efficiency) plus 50 μl of Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and incubated for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were then removed from tissue culture plates and serum-starved on ice for 4.5 h prior to incubation with 100 ng/ml M-CSF. For the Lyn transfections, 1.0 μg of WT SHIP-1, 1.0 μg of WT Lyn, and 0.5 μg of GST-Akt were added to cells and treated in the same manner as described above. In cells transfected without SHIP-1 or Lyn, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was added to the transfection mixture to equalize DNA quantity. Membrane Preparations of 3T3-Fms Transfectants—3T3-Fms cells were transfected with SHIP-1 plus Lyn or pcDNA3 as described above. Cells were then resuspended in 500 μl of Buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH = 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4) and sonicated to lyse cells. Samples were then centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min to clear the nuclear fraction. Samples were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was designated as the cytosolic fraction. The membrane fraction (pellet) was then washed thoroughly in Buffer A and resuspended in 100 μl of TN1 lysis buffer, vortexed repeatedly for 30 min on ice, and then spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was designated as the membrane fraction. SHIP-1 Becomes Phosphorylated following M-CSF Stimulation and Negatively Regulates Akt Activation—Because M-CSF-deficient mice have reduced numbers of monocytes and macrophages and SHIP-1-deficient mice suffer expansion and infiltration of macrophages and other myeloid cells into many organs, including the lungs (5Wiktor-Jedrzejczak W. Urbanowska E. Aukerman S.L. Pollard J.W. Stanley E.R. Ralph P. Ansari A.A. Sell K.W. Szperl M. Exp. Hematol. 1991; 19: 1049-1054PubMed Google Scholar, 30Helgason C.D. Damen J.E. Rosten P. Grewal R. Sorensen P. Chappel S.M. Borowski A. Jirik F. Krystal G. Humphries R.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1610-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine the molecular details of SHIP-1 function following M-CSF stimulation. In the monocytic-like cell line, THP-1, which endogenously expresses both SHIP-1 and the M-CSF-R, Akt becomes rapidly phosphorylated after 1 min on threonine 308 (Thr(P)-308) following M-CSF activation (Fig. 1A, top panel), an event that is associated with Akt activity following growth factor stimulation (31Stokoe D.

A. 2001; 98: 10983-10985Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Additionally, SHIP-1 becomes rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated after 1 min following M-CSF activation of THP-1 cells (Fig. 1B, top panel), indicating that THP-1 cells are a good model for studying M-CSF-R signaling. Each blot was subsequently re-probed to ensure equal loading (Fig. 1, A and B, bottom panels). Recent studies investigating the functional consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation on SHIP-1 enzymatic activity revealed two interesting findings. First, Phee et al. (29Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19090-19097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) demonstrated that membrane localization, not phosphorylation, of SHIP-1 was the critical event for induction of its enzymatic activity. Second, it has been shown that Fcγ RIIb1 phosphorylation results in SHIP-1 phosphorylation and subsequent enzymatic activity. This concept was supported in a recent study published by Hibbs et al. (35Hibbs M.L. Harder K.W. Armes J. Kountouri N. Quilici C. Casagranda F. Dunn A.R. Tarlinton D.M. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1593-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 36Tridandapani S. Kelley T. Pradhan M. Cooney D. Justement L.B. Coggeshall K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which demonstrated that SHIP-1 hyperphosphorylation correlated with Fcγ RIIb1 hyperphosphorylation in B-cells, leading to the inhibition of signaling events. Taken together, these events indicate that signaling through the M-CSF-R stimulates both positive signaling events, in terms of Akt activation, and negative signaling events, in terms of SHIP-1 phosphorylation. Because Akt utilizes PI(3,4,5)P3 to localize to the plasma membrane, and SHIP-1 reduces the availability of PI(3,4,5)P3 by converting PI(3,4,5)P3 to PI(3,4)P2, SHIP-1 may play a role in limiting Akt activation after M-CSF activation. To further investigate the importance of SHIP-1 in M-CSF-R-induced cellular signaling, we decided to use 3T3-Fms cells. These cells, which have been utilized in previous studies to study M-CSF-R signaling (18Kelley T.W. Graham M.M. Doseff A.I. Pomerantz R.W. Lau S.M. Ostrowski M.C. Franke T.F. Marsh C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26393-26398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 37Cheng M. Wang D. Roussel M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6553-6558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), are stably transfected with the human M-CSF-R but do not contain SHIP-1, therefore making it a useful model for this study. These cells were transiently transfected with or without wild-type SHIP-1 plus GST-Akt, and Thr(P)-308 GST-Akt levels were measured. Fig. 1C shows that transfection of 3T3-Fms cells with wild-type SHIP-1 (top panel, lanes 1 and 2) reduced Thr(P)-308 GST-Akt levels following M-CSF activation in comparison to cells that were not transfected with SHIP-1 (top panel, lanes 3 and 4). This blot was then re-probed for total Akt to show equal loading (Fig. 1C, middle panel). These data are quantitated and represented in graph form in Fig. 1D. The graph compares the -fold increase in Thr(P)-308 GST-Akt levels, following M-CSF stimulation, of the SHIP-1-transfected and non-transfected lanes relative to non-stimulated. In the absence of SHIP-1, the level of Thr(P)-308 GST-Akt after M-CSF stimulation is ∼7.7-fold greater than non-stimulated. In the presence of SHIP-1, the -fold difference is only ∼5.3-fold for M-CSF-stimulated versus non-stimulated. To ensure that 3T3-Fms cells do not endogenously express SHIP-1, we also performed immunoprecipitations of SHIP-1-transfected and non-transfected cells and saw evidence of SHIP-1 expression only in the SHIP-1-transfected cells (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). Furthermore, SHIP-1 became tyrosine-phosphorylated following M-CSF activation of 3T3-Fms cells (data not shown). These data indicate the importance of SHIP-1 in the negative regulation of M-CSF-induced Akt activation. The Src Kinase Inhibitor PP2 Decreases the Phosphorylation of SHIP-1 following M-CSF Activation of THP-1 Cells—Because SHIP-1 is phosphorylated following M-CSF activation of THP-1 and 3T3-Fms cells, we next wanted to determine the possible mediator of this phosphorylation. Previous studies of signaling through the M-CSF-R have indicated the involvement of the Src kinases, specifically via tyrosine 561 (9Courtneidge S.A. Dhand R. Pilat D. Twamley G.M. Waterfield M.D. Roussel M.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Similarly, Phee et al. (29Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19090-19097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have recently shown that the Src kinase Lyn phosphorylates SHIP-1 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Li et al. (38Li H.L. Davis W.W. Whiteman E.L. Birnbaum M.J. Pure E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6890-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have shown that Lyn-deficient B-cells displayed hyperactivation of Akt, indicating a negative regulatory role for this Src kinase and a possible candidate responsible for the phosphorylation of SHIP-1. Therefore, we next investigated the whether SHIP-1 was phosphorylated in a Src kinase-dependent manner. Fig. 2A shows that preincubation of THP-1 cells with PP2, an inhibitor of the Src kinases, prior to M-CSF activation reduced the phosphorylation of SHIP-1 (top panel, lanes 6–10) compared with the vehicle control (Me2SO)-treated samples (top panel, lanes 1–5). Quantitation of these bands is shown in Fig. 2B and indicates that preincubation of THP-1 cells with PP2 resulted in a ∼2-fold reduction in SHIP-1 phosphorylation after 1 min of M-CSF treatment compared with the Me2SO-treated lane. Although these data do not signify that Lyn is responsible for the phosphorylation of SHIP-1, they do indicate that the Src kinases are an important component following M-CSF activation. SHIP-1 Associates with Lyn after M-CSF Activation via the SH2 Domain of SHIP-1—Next, because of the published data regarding the importance of Lyn in both phosphorylating SHIP-1 and negatively regulating Akt activation, we sought to determine whether SHIP-1 associated with Lyn following M-CSF activation. By utilizing THP-1 cells, we show that SHIP-1 associated with Lyn following M-CSF activation (Fig. 3A, top panel, lane 2). The same blot was re-probed for SHIP-1 to show equal loading (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). Furthermore, this association was not inhibited by preincubation of THP-1 cells with PP2 (Fig. 3B, top panel, lane 3) or the PP2-inactive analog PP3 (lane 4). The same blot was also re-probed with SHIP-1 to show equal loading (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). These data indicate that the association of SHIP-1 and Lyn is M-CSF-dependent but independent of both the kinase activity of Lyn and the phosphorylation of SHIP-1. Given that the association of SHIP-1 and Lyn was activation-dependent, we next sought to determine whether the SH2 domain of SHIP-1 was involved in binding Lyn. Therefore, we utilized a GST fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of SHIP-1. We added this GST-SH2 domain to resting or M-CSF-stimulated THP-1 cell lysates and found that the SH2 domain of SHIP-1 interacted with Lyn following M-CSF activation of THP-1 cells (Fig. 4A, lane 2). Consistent with our previous study with endogenous SHIP-1, this interaction was not inhibited by preincubation of THP-1 cells with PP2 or PP3 (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4, respectively), indicating"

Optical pulses coincident with the giant radio pulses were on average 3% brighter than those coincident with normal radio pulses.

Electron lifetime against synchrotron cooling matches the source transit time over the x-ray features' length. Such an x-ray detection of a pulsar bow shock (with no Halpha emission) allows us to gauge the pulsar electron injection energy and the shock magnetic field while constraining the angle of Geminga's motion and the local matter density."

Failure to adapt to osmotic stress can result in apoptotic cell death. In the present study, we assessed the role of aldose reductase, the key enzyme of the polyol pathway, in cardiac myocyte apoptosis. Hyperosmotic stress, elicited by exposure of cultured rat cardiac myocytes to the nonpermeant solutes sorbitol and mannitol, caused identical cell shrinkage and adaptive hexose uptake stimulation. In contrast, only sorbitol induced the polyol pathway and triggered stress pathways as well as apoptosis-related signaling events. Sorbitol resulted in activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p54 c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and protein kinase B. Furthermore, sorbitol treatment resulting in induction and activation of aldose reductase, decreased expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL, increased DNA fragmentation, and glutathione depletion. Apoptosis was attenuated by aldose reductase inhibition with zopolrestat and also by glutathione replenishment with N-acetylcysteine. In conclusion, our data show that hypertonic shrinkage of cardiac myocytes alone is not sufficient to induce cardiac myocyte apoptosis.

Programmed cell death culminating in apoptosis is responsible for normal tissue homeostasis and has increasingly been implicated in mediating pathological cell loss (1Kerr J.R.F. Wyllie A.H. Curie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is accompanied by characteristic morphological changes, including cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, plasma membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and the formation of apoptotic bodies (2Saraste A. Pulkki K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). In recent years, molecular signaling pathways leading to apoptosis have been elucidated, and the central role of caspases in initiation of events characteristic of this form of cell death, such as DNA fragmentation, is well established (3Hengartner M.O.

However, other osmotically active substances such as mannitol are intravenously administered in the treatment of a number of clinical conditions including myocardial reperfusion injury (16Paczynski R.

Circulation. 1984; 70: I91-I95PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these beneficial applications, little is known about the effects of mannitol on cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The primary mechanism of action of hyperosmotic stress appears to be mechanical and related to shrinkage of these cells. However, the underlying mechanisms by which hyperosmotic stress triggers apoptosis in the cardiomyocyte remain unknown. Maeno et al. (21Maeno E. Ishizaki Y. Kanaseki T. Hazama A. Okada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9487-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) have shown that apoptotic volume decrease, which is caused by disordered cell volume regulation, is an early prerequisite for events leading to apoptotic cell death. To avoid excessive alterations in volume, cells have developed regulatory mechanisms including ion transport across the membrane and changes in metabolism. The ability of cells to resist osmotic shrinkage by cell volume regulation parallels their resistance to apoptosis after osmotic shock (22Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C950-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

AR catalyzes the formation of sorbitol from glucose using NADPH as a cofactor (24Garcia-Perez A. Martin B. Murphy H.R. Uchida S. Murer H. Cowley Jr., B.D. Handler J.S. Burg M.B. J. Biol.

Although the induction of AR has been associated with compensatory responses to hyperosmotic stress, it also plays an important role in the development of complications in diabetes (29Cohen M.P.

However, in lens epithelial cells and pancreatic β-cells, AR activation induced apoptosis, possibly causing an imbalance in redox status (36Hamaoka R. Fujii J. Miyagawa J. Takahashi M. Kishimoto M.

In cultured retinal pericytes, glucose-induced apoptosis is mediated through the AR pathway, involving increased oxidative stress characterized by reduced GSH contents (38Mika K. Nakamura J.

Whether osmotically active nonionic substances such as sorbitol or mannitol induce AR and whether this enzyme mediates apoptosis as a consequence of hyperosmotic stress in cardiac myocytes has not been investigated. In this study, we addressed such issues in cardiomyocytes and asked whether sorbitol- and mannitol-mediated hyperosmotic stress activate different signaling pathways. We also investigated whether induction of AR and increased intracellular sorbitol levels mediates hyperosmotic stress-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate here in cultured rat cardiomyocytes that mannitol or sorbitol induced hyperosmotic stress, reduced cell volume, and stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake to a similar degree. Treatment with sorbitol, but not mannitol, induced and activated AR, decreased sorbitol dehydrogenase levels, stimulated intracellular sorbitol accumulation, increased DNA fragmentation, and decreased the levels of the antiapoptotic Bcl-xL protein. Phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK was enhanced in the presence of sorbitol but not with mannitol. Both JNK isoforms (p46 and p54) were differentially activated by sorbitol and mannitol. p38-MAPK and protein kinase B (PKB) were activated to a lesser extent by both sorbitol and mannitol at hyperosmotic concentrations. Increases in AR protein levels and activity by sorbitol-induced hyperosmotic stress were differentially regulated by ERK, p38-MAPK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/PKB pathways. GSH intracellular levels were decreased by hyperosmotic sorbitol but not by mannitol. Hyperosmotic sorbitol-induced apoptosis was attenuated by zopolrestat, a specific AR inhibitor. DNA fragmentation stimulated by sorbitol was also prevented by N-acetylcysteine (NAC; a GSH precursor). Our data demonstrate that AR contributes to apoptosis triggered by hyperosmotic stress in cultured cardiac myocytes. These data also indicated that our current understanding of the protective mechanisms of mannitol in myocardial reperfusion injury needs to be reevaluated.

Culture and Treatment of Cardiomyocytes—Cardiac myocytes were prepared from hearts of 3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (40Foncea R. Andersson M. Ketterman A. Blakesley V.

Rats were bred in the Animal Breeding Facility of the Faculty of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Chile (Santiago, Chile). Cardiomyocytes were plated at a final density of 1.4 × 103/mm2 on gelatin-coated 35-, 60-, or 100-mm Petri dishes. For fluorescence measurements, cells were plated on gelatin-coated 25-mm glass coverslips in 35-mm Petri dishes. Cardiac myocytes were cultured in the absence or presence of different concentrations of sorbitol or mannitol dissolved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/medium 199. The final osmolarities of culture media containing different amounts of sorbitol or mannitol were determined using a freezing point osmometer (Osmet). Cultured cardiomyocytes were identified using an anti-β-myosin heavy chain antibody. Cell cultures were at least 95% pure. Preparation of Cell Extracts—Cardiomyocytes were scraped into 100 μl of cold lysis buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 140 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein content of supernatants was determined by a Bio-Rad Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Soluble fractions were heated at 95 °C with 0.33 volumes of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis for Aldose Reductase and Sorbitol Dehydrogenase—Cell lysates were matched for protein (15 μg), separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose (0.45 μm) using a Trans-blot unit (Bio-Rad) for 1.5 h at 100 V. Membranes were blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST) overnight at 4 °C. Anti-AR or -SDH primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution (1:5,000). Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at 25 °C. After washing in PBST (4 × 15 min each), blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1:5,000 in 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBST). Blots were washed again in PBST (4 × 15 min each), and specific binding was detected using ECL with exposure to Kodak film for 2–10 s. Each blot was quantified by scanning densitometry. Aldose Reductase Activity—Cultured cardiomyocytes were exposed to culture media containing different concentrations of sorbitol or mannitol at the indicated times. Cells were then rinsed three times with PBS and lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Cell extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for1hat4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were dialyzed in 2 liters of lysis buffer overnight. The dialyzed samples were incubated with 1 ml of DEAE-cellulose pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. AR was eluted with increasing NaCl concentrations (0–300 mm). The fraction with the highest AR activity (50 mm NaCl) was used throughout the study. Enzyme activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 37 °C by monitoring the decrease in absorbance of NADPH at 340 nm for 3 min in the absence or presence of 5 mm d-glucose as a substrate (25Das B. Srivastava S. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 1145-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay, in a total volume of 1 ml, contained 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.4 m Li2SO4, 5 mm d-glucose, enzyme (1–3 μg of protein); the reaction was started by the addition of 100 μm NADPH. One unit of the enzyme was defined as 1 μmol of NADPH oxidized per min at 37 °C. Determination of Intracellular Sorbitol Levels—Intracellular sorbitol level was determined essentially as described by Malone (42Malone J. Diabetes. 1980; 29: 861-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured cardiac myocytes (4 × 106 cells/60-mm Petri dish) were lysed with 200 μl of 6% (w/v) HClO4 and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were neutralized with 62 mm glycine (pH 9.4). Sorbitol was determined using a 40-μl sample in glycine buffer 50 mm (pH 9.4), 0.64 units of SDH, and 0.2 mm β-NAD, in a final volume of 0.5 ml. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, samples were analyzed in a spectrofluorometer (emission, 366 nm; excitation, 452 nm). The acid pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of 1 m NaOH and incubated for 30 min at 50 °C. Protein content was determined by the Lowry method (43Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results were expressed as mg of sorbitol per mg of protein. Assessment of Cell Volume—Cardiomyocyte relative volume was determined by calcein measurements using a modified protocol (44Barros L.F. Barnes K. Ingram J.C. Castro J. Porras O.H. Baldwin S.A. Pflugers Arch. 2001; 442: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, cardiomyocytes grown on glass coverslips were loaded at room temperature with 5 μm calcein-acetoxymethyl ester for 5–10 min in Krebs Ringer phosphate HEPES buffer (KRPH; 136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.25 mm CaCl2,5mm Na2PO4,20mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 25 mm glucose (KRPH-glc). Cells were imaged at room temperature every 30 s at 488-nm excitation/510–545-nm emission using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope. Under these conditions, dye bleaching was negligible. In order to compare values from different cells, data were standardized by assigning base-line fluorescence (F 0) the value of 1. Glucose Transport Assay—Cardiomyocytes were placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/medium 199 containing 25 mm glucose for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with KRPH buffer and either untreated or stimulated as described in the legend to Fig. 4. Uptake of 0.2 mm 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose was estimated over a period of 2 min in KRPH buffer at 4 °C by a protocol modified from a previous communication (45Barros L.F. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Control experiments showed that at these temperatures intracellular hexose concentrations were less then 20% of the extracellular values. Carrier-mediated uptake rates were obtained by subtracting nonspecific uptake. The latter was measured in the presence of 20 μm cytochalasin B and was less than 10% of the basal uptake. Transport was stopped with three washes of 50 μm phloretin in ice-cold PBS. Radioactivity was released with 1% Triton X-100 and measured by liquid scintillation counting (45Barros L.F. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Samples were normalized for protein content using the Bradford protein assay. ERK, p38-MAPK, JNK, and PI3K/PKB Signaling Pathway Activation—Western blots were performed as described above. The membranes were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-phospho-ERK antibody, anti-phospho-p38-MAPK antibody, anti-phospho-JNK antibody, or anti-phospho-PKB antibody. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-ERK antibody, anti-p38-MAPK antibody, anti-JNK antibody, or anti-PKB antibody. Blots were quantified by laser-scanning densitometry. Results were expressed as the ratio of phosphorylated protein kinase to total protein kinase levels. All blots were controlled for equal loading. Bcl-xL Levels—Bcl-xL levels were determined by Western blot analysis for Bcl-xL. Proteins (20–50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% (w/v) nonfat milk powder in PBS (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST) for 60 min at room temperature. Primary antibody was diluted 1:1,000 in blocking solution. Nitrocellulose was incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing in PBST (three times for 10 min each), nitrocellulose was incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1:5,000 in 1% (w/v) nonfat milk powder in PBST). After repeating the washing procedure described above, bound antibody was detected by ECL with exposure to Hyperfilm for 0.5–30 min. Blots were quantified by scanning densitometry. DNA Fragmentation—For the detection of DNA fragmentation, cells were washed with cold PBS. DNA was prepared by scraping the cells into 1 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 0.8 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 8 mm Tris-HCl (TE; pH 8.0) and 4% SDS. The DNA was extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting DNA was incubated with proteinase K (50 μg/ml, Sigma) for 1 h at 50 °C to facilitate protein disruption. DNA was re-extracted from supernatants with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). DNA, precipitated from the upper aqueous phase with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ice-cold ethanol, was left at –20 °C overnight before centrifugation. Pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of TE buffer, followed by a 60-min incubation with DNase-free RNase A (2 mg/ml; Sigma) at 37 °C. Samples were re-extracted, and DNA was precipitated as described above. Pellets were resuspended in TE buffer, and DNA concentrations were quantified from the absorbance at 260 nm. DNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose and visualized by staining with a solution containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide (46Morales M.P. Gálvez A. Eltit J.M. Ocaranza P. Díaz-Araya G. Lavandero S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Measurement of Intracellular Glutathione—GSH levels were determined using an enzymatic assay according to Anderson and Meister (47Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9530-9533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of Results and Statistical Analysis—Data shown are the means ± S.E. of the number of independent experiment indicated (n)or representative experiments performed on at least three separate occasions with similar outcome. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance, and comparisons between groups were performed using a protected Tukey's test. A value of p < 0.05 was set as the limit of statistical significance. Effect of Hyperosmotic Solutions of Sorbitol and Mannitol on Polyol Pathway in Cultured Cardiomyocytes—AR is the first enzyme in the polyol pathway, and different reports have shown that a hyperosmotic environment stimulates the expression and activity of AR in many cell types (48Kaneko M. Carper D. Nishimura C. Millen J. Bock M. Hohman T.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 49Mizisin A.P. Li L. Perello M. Freshwater J.D. Kalichman M.W. Roux L. Calcutt N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F90-F97PubMed Google Scholar). The time course of hyperosmotic AR induction by sorbitol is depicted in Fig. 1A. Induction of AR was slow and only detectable after 8 h of hyperosmotic exposure. Maximum AR levels were reached after 24 h; however, after 32 h, AR levels decreased again. To assess whether hyperosmolarity affects the levels of AR in cardiac myocytes, we compared the amount of AR protein in lysates obtained from isosmotically or hyperosmotically treated cardiomyocytes with sorbitol and mannitol for 24 h. AR was detected as a single band with M r 36,000 in isosmotically and hyperosmotically treated cells. Hyperosmotic challenge with sorbitol (400 and 600 mosmol/kg water) caused an increase (1.4- and 2.5-fold, respectively) in the amount of AR protein after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 1B). Mannitol did not significantly change AR protein levels in hyperosmotically treated cardiomyocytes when compared with control cells maintained under isosmotic conditions (270 mosmol/kg water) (Fig. 1B). Thus, AR induction in cardiac myocyte was dependent on the nature of the osmolyte. Hyperosmolarity is also a known regulator of AR activity in some cell types (23Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F983-F996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we next determined whether the increases in AR protein levels were paralleled by increases in AR activity levels. Most human tissues have three forms of aldo-keto reductases, namely aldose reductase and aldehyde reductases I and II (26Srivastava S.K. Golblum R.M. Hair G.A. Das B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 800: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Since there is some overlap in the substrate specificity of various aldo-keto reductases, AR is usually purified by DEAE column chromatography (26Srivastava S.K. Golblum R.M. Hair G.A. Das B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 800: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that aldehyde reductase is not expressed in cardiac muscle (50Vander Jagt D.L. Robinson B. Taylor K.K. Hunsaker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20982-20987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this partial purification step ensured that measurements in our assay were specific for AR activity. As shown in Fig. 1C, sorbitol-supplemented hyperosmotic medium increased AR activity. In general, AR protein content paralleled the changes in AR activity induced by sorbitol (Fig. 1, B and C). Under all hyperosmotic conditions tested, mannitol failed to increase AR activity in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 1C). Collectively, these results suggest that mannitol neither activated AR nor induced AR expression in rat cardiac myocytes. Several studies in other cell types have suggested that the o"
https://openalex.org/W2149117537,"Viral protein R (Vpr) of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) is the major virion-associated accessory protein that affects a number of biological functions in the retroviral life cycle, including promotion of the transport of the preintegration complex into the nucleus and the induction of G2 host cell cycle arrest. Our recent investigation of the conformational heterogeneity of the proline residues in the N terminus of Vpr suggested a functional interaction between Vpr and a host peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) that might regulate the cis/trans interconversion of the imidic bond within the conserved proline residues of Vpr in vivo. Using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, Far Western blot, and pulldown experiments a physical interaction of Vpr with the major host PPIase cyclophilin A (CypA) is now demonstrated. The interaction domain involves the N-terminal region of Vpr including an essential role for proline in position 35. The CypA inhibitor cyclosporin A and non-immunosuppressive PPIase inhibitors such as NIM811 and sanglifehrin A block expression of Vpr without affecting pre- or post-translational events such as transcription, intracellular transport, or virus incorporation of Vpr. Similarly to CypA inhibition, Vpr expression is also reduced in HIV-1 infected CypA–/– knock-out T cells. This study thus shows that in addition to the interaction between CypA and HIV-1 capsid occurring during early steps in virus replication, CypA is also important for the de novo synthesis of Vpr and that in the absence of CypA activity, the Vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest is completely lost in HIV-1-infected T cells.

One of these gene products, the highly conserved 96-amino acid viral protein R (Vpr) has received considerable attention, and a number of biological functions have been attributed to its presence in various cellular and extracellular compartments. The most intensively investigated biological functions of Vpr are those affecting the translocation of the preintegration complex of the incoming virus from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and the arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (1Sherman M.P. Greene W.C. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2Sherman M.P. Schubert U. Williams S.A. de Noronha C.M. Kreisberg J.F. Henklein P. Greene W.C.

The nuclear targeting function of Vpr has been associated with HIV-1 infection of terminally differentiated macrophages. Regarding the second function of Vpr, which leads to G2 cell cycle arrest in HIV-1-infected and/or Vpr-transfected human cells, it was implicated that this activity provides an intracellular milieu conductive for enhanced viral replication by increasing HIV LTR-driven gene expression (4Goh W.C.

Virol. 1998; 72: 4686-4693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that the prolonged G2 arrest induced by Vpr ultimately leads to apoptosis of the infected cell. Conversely, early anti-apoptotic effects of Vpr have also been described that are superceded later by its pro-apoptotic effects (9Conti L. Matarrese P. Varano B. Gauzzi M.C. Sato A. Malorni W. Belardelli F. Gessani S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3293-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These pro-apoptotic effects of Vpr may result from either effects on the integrity of the nuclear envelope or direct mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (10Ferri K.F. Jacotot E. Blanco J. Este J.A. Kroemer G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 926: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), perhaps involving Vpr-mediated formation of ion channels in cellular membranes (11Piller S.C. Ewart G.D. Premkumar A. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).As the biologically relevant activity of the multifunctional Vpr has not yet been clarified, the molecular bases for many of its effects remain elusive. To date structural studies of the full-length molecule have been hampered by the fact that this protein does not crystallize, and the use of NMR techniques is complicated by the strong tendency for Vpr to undergo self-association. In addition, the structure of Vpr depends critically on the solution conditions, and an unresolved apparent heterogeneity in the composition of the polypeptide has been observed (12Wecker K. Morellet N. Bouaziz S. Roques B.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3779-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Henklein P. Bruns K. Sherman M.P. Tessmer U. Licha K. Kopp J. de Noronha C.M.

However, a somewhat limited model is slowly emerging from structural studies of fragments of Vpr (14Luo Z. Butcher D.J. Murali R. Srinivasan A. Huang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These studies were performed in aqueous solution that required the presence of either detergents or micelles to detect the most structured forms of Vpr. The secondary structures in Vpr emerging from these analyses (summarized in the accompanying paper (19Bruns K. Fossen T. Wray V. Henklein P. Tessmer U. Schubert U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43156-43169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar)) suggest the presence of an α-helix-turn-α-helix motif between residues 17 and 48 and an amphipathic α-helix between amino acids 53–55 and 78–83 (12Wecker K. Morellet N. Bouaziz S. Roques B.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3779-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15Schuler W. Wecker K. de Rocquigny H. Baudat Y. Sire J. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2105-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These helices most likely play a key role in self-association and the interaction of Vpr with heterologous proteins (13Henklein P. Bruns K. Sherman M.P. Tessmer U. Licha K. Kopp J. de Noronha C.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32131-32137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both helical domains are highly conserved and contribute to the formation of a novel nuclear import signal (21Sherman M.P. de Noronha C.M. Pearce D. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8159-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The distal helix also contains a leucine-rich nuclear export signal whose function is inhibited by leptomycin B (22Sherman M.P. de Noronha C.M. Heusch M.I. Greene S. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1522-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The C terminus of Vpr contains a basic amino acid-rich segment between residues 73 and 96 for which little definite structure has been assigned (15Schuler W. Wecker K. de Rocquigny H. Baudat Y. Sire J. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2105-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, this region is conserved and influences the stability and, potentially, the structure of the entire protein (8Yao X.J. Mouland A.J. Subbramanian R.A. Forget J. Rougeau N. Bergeron D. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4686-4693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It contains a bipartite, arginine-rich nuclear import signal that can promote nuclear uptake of heterologous proteins via the nuclear pore complex (22Sherman M.P. de Noronha C.M. Heusch M.I. Greene S. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1522-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23Jenkins Y. McEntee M. Weis K. Greene W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Various investigations have shown that the C-terminal domain also participates in a number of specific protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions such as with NCp7 (24de Rocquigny H. Petitjean P. Tanchou V. Decimo D. Drouot L. Delaunay T. Darlix J.L. Roques B.P. J. Biol.

Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), RNA (26de Rocquigny H. Caneparo A. Delaunay T. Bischerour J. Mouscadet J.F. Roques B.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3654-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the adenine nucleotide translocator of the mitochondrial pore (27Jacotot E. Ravagnan L. Loeffler M. Ferri K.F. Vieira H.L. Zamzami N. Costantini P. Druillennec S. Hoebeke J. Briand J.P. Irinopoulou T. Daugas E. Susin S.A. Cointe D. Xie Z.H. Reed J.C. Roques B.P. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar).In contrast to the C-terminal domain, few functional properties have been attributed to the N-terminal domain of Vpr, and its participation as an interaction surface with other molecules has received less attention. Many previous structural characterizations of Vpr (for instance see Refs. 12Wecker K. Morellet N. Bouaziz S. Roques B.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3779-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Henklein P. Bruns K. Sherman M.P. Tessmer U. Licha K. Kopp J. de Noronha C.M. Greene W.C. Wray V. Schubert U. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32131-32137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown the important influence of environmental factors and indicate that in vivo folding of Vpr will probably require the presence of structure-stabilizing interacting factors (for review see Ref. 3Bukrinsky M. Adzhubei A. Rev. Med. Virol. 1999; 9: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently focused our attention on the N-terminal domain of Vpr (19Bruns K. Fossen T. Wray V. Henklein P. Tessmer U. Schubert U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43156-43169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and found that two of the four conserved prolines at residues 14 and 35 in this domain exhibit an unusually high content of cis-conformations of the imidic bond. Based on the cis/trans phenomenon that could be important for the folding of Vpr, it was projected that a potential interaction between Vpr and a host peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) might regulate the interconversion of the imidic bond of these N-terminal proline residues of Vpr in vivo.As for most other intracellular parasites, the replication of HIV depends on the interaction with host cell factors, and some of these are incorporated specifically into progeny virions. Among the most abundant cellular proteins and the first ever found in HIV-1 virions is cyclophilin A (CypA). This protein is specifically incorporated into HIV-1 virions, but not into virions of other lentiviruses, through an interaction with a proline-rich region of the HIV-1 capsid (CA) protein. In particular, Pro-222, which is conserved in the CA region of all HIV-1 Gag polyproteins, appears to be important for the interaction of HIV-1 Gag with CypA (Refs. 28Franke E.K. Yuan H.E. Luban J. Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar and 29Thali M. Bukovsky A. Kondo E. Rosenwirth B. Walsh C.T. Sodroski J. Gottlinger H.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar; for review see Refs. 30Luban J. Cell. 1996; 87: 1157-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar and 31Ott D.E. Rev. Med. Virol. 2002; 12: 359-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Earlier studies using two-hybrid screens found that HIV-1 Gag binds to most of the known members of the family of CyPs (32Luban J. Bossolt K.L. Franke E.K. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). CyPs were originally described as binding partners of cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive cyclic undecapeptide used clinically to prevent allocraft rejection (33Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Speicher D.W. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). CsA binds with nanomolar affinity to CypA, and this complex inhibits calcineurin, a calcium-dependent phosphatase that regulates the expression of various cytokine genes in activated T cells (for review see Ref. 34Ivery M.T. Med. Res. Rev. 2000; 20: 452-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). CyPs belong to the PPIases, a group of enzymes found in organisms ranging from prokaryotes to humans, that catalyze the otherwise relatively slow cis/trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds in vitro. As CyPs have been proposed to regulate protein folding in vivo (34Ivery M.T. Med. Res. Rev. 2000; 20: 452-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) it was conceivable that the family of CyPs, and CypA in particular, are possible candidates for providing a PPIase activity that regulates cis/trans interconversion in Vpr.A large body of evidence supports a function of CypA in formation of infectious HIV-1 viruses (for review see Refs. 30Luban J. Cell. 1996; 87: 1157-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar and 31Ott D.E. Rev. Med. Virol. 2002; 12: 359-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These studies were based either on mutation within gag or the use of competitive CypA inhibitors such as CsA that interfere with the CypA-Gag interaction (35Steinkasserer A. Harrison R. Billich A. Hammerschmid F. Werner G. Wolff B. Peichl P. Palfi G. Schnitzel W. Mlynar E. et al.J. Virol. 1995; 69: 814-824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Billich A. Hammerschmid F. Peichl P. Wenger R. Zenke G.

Gottlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7110-7113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A more conclusive proof that among the other 14 known members of mammalian CyPs only CypA plays a functional role in supporting HIV-1 replication was provided by selective genetic inactivation of the gene encoding CypA in human CD4+ T cells (40Braaten D. Luban J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1300-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition, the competitive inhibitor CsA exhibits high affinity for the hydrophobic pocket of almost all CyPs and thus competitively inhibits the interaction of CypA with HIV-1 Gag (28Franke E.K. Yuan H.E. Luban J. Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 29Thali M. Bukovsky A. Kondo E. Rosenwirth B. Walsh C.T. Sodroski J. Gottlinger H.G.

The immunosuppressive activity of CsA is not correlated with anti-HIV activity, since the nonimmunosuppressive derivative NIM811 ([methyl-Ile4]-cyclosporin) is an even more potent inhibitor of CypA-mediated HIV-1 replication than the parental CsA (29Thali M.

Thus, CsA and related nonimmunosuppressive derivatives form an interesting class of drugs that can modulate the interaction of CypA with other proteins.In the present work, we demonstrate an unexpected interplay of Vpr with CypA that depends of the N-terminal domain of Vpr containing conserved proline residues. Most importantly, we report that CypA regulates the expression of Vpr and is required for the Vpr-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest in HIV-1-infected T cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSBIAcore Spectroscopy—Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed at 25 °C using a BIACORE 2000 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) equipped with a CM5 research-grade sensor chip. Recombinant CypA (Sigma) was immobilized at a concentration ranging from 4200 to 11200 response units using standard amine-coupling chemistry in three flow cells, and a further flow cell without CypA was used as a control. The peptides Vpr1–40, Vpr1–20, Vpr21–40, and respective proline mutants were dissolved at concentrations ranging from 1 to 250 μm in a running buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4) and were injected over the flow cells at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Data were collected at a rate of 2.5 Hz during the 120-s association and dissociation phase. Results were corrected for the response unit values of the reference cell (without CypA) to exclude unspecific binding of Vpr to the chip matrix. Experiments were repeated at least three times, each with two different charges of Vpr peptides and CypA, and afforded reproducible data.Northern Blot Analysis—HeLa cells were transfected with pCMV-FLAG-Vpr, and 5 h post-transfection cells were treated with CsA (50 μg/ml), NIM811 (10 μg/ml), SFA (10 μg/ml), or no inhibitor (aliquot of solvent Me2SO). Following 0, 2, or 8 h of treatment, cells were harvested, washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen immediately at –80 °C. Total cell RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen), and 10 μg of each RNA sample was separated in 1.2% denaturing agarose gel containing 17.8% formaldehyde. Following blotting and UV cross-linking to the nylon membrane (Hybond-N™; Amersham Biosciences) the membrane was pre-hybridized for 5 h at 65 °C in Denhardt's solutions containing salmon sperm DNA and poly(A) RNA according to modification of a standard procedure described previously (43Valent P. Bevec D. Maurer D. Besemer J. Di Padova F. Butterfield J.H. Speiser W. Majdic O. Lechner K. Bettelheim P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3339-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For hybridization oligonucleotides (FLAG probe 5′-cttgtcgtcatcgtctttgtatgccat-3′, Vpr probe 5′-agtaacgcctattctgctatgtcgacacccaattctgaaatg-3′) were radioactively labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using terminal transferase (220 582; Roche Applied Science) and added to the hybridization solution for 12 h at 65 °C. After washing, blots were analyzed by autoradiography. For internal control blots were stripped for 30 min in 0.1% SDS at 70 °C and re-hybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (5′-ccatggtggtgaagacgccagtggactcc-3).Transfection, Infections, Immunostaining, Flow Cytometry, and DNA Content Analysis—Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000™ or calcium phosphate for precipitation of DNA. T cell cultures were infected with isogenic strains of HIV-1NL4–3, differing only by the presence or absence of vpr (44Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Eckstein D.A. Sherman M.P. Penn M.L. Chin P.S. De Noronha C.M. Greene W.C. Goldsmith M.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1407-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Generally, 107 cells were incubated with virus stocks (200 ng of p24Gag) in 1 ml of medium for 2 h prior to washing and subsequent culturing at 1 × 106 cells per ml for the indicated times. HIV-infected cells were fixed and permeabilized with a solution of 1% paraformaldehyde, 1 mg/ml human IgG (Gemini Bio-Products, Inc.), and 0.1% Tween 20 in FACS buffer for at least 1 h. 106 cells were immunostained in 50 μl of FACS buffer with 1:50 dilution of the monoclonal anti-p24 antibody KC57 (Lot 13; Coulter), conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. Cellular DNA content was assessed by additional staining with 0.01 mm To-Pro-3 iodide (Molecular Probes) in the presence of 1 mg/ml RNaseA followed by analysis using a FACS-can™ flow cytometer acquiring linear fluorescence in the FL4 channel. DNA profiles were analyzed with FlowJo software (Treestar).Cell Culture, Pulse-Chase, and Western Blot Analyses—CD4+ human T lymphoma Jurkat T cell lines and the knock-out line PPIA – / – were cultured in RPMI 1640, and HeLa cells (ATCC CCL2) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (2 mCi/ml), and pulse-chase experiments and immunoprecipitation were performed as described (46Schubert U. Clouse K.A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7699-7711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Vpr detection in virions cell, culture supernatants were tested with p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to assess peak virus replication during a 7- to 10-day period. Virus pellets were normalized for CA content by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and aliquots were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed by Western blot with rabbit antibodies specific for CA and Vpr followed by enhanced chemiluminescence staining. For Western blot kinetic analyses, HeLa cells were transfected with pCMV-FLAG-Vpr, pCMV-3HA-Vpr wild type, pCMV-3HA-VprP5,10,14A, or pCMV-3HA-VprP35N, and after the optimum time post-transfection necessary to initiate homologous gene expression that was determined for each construct, cells were harvested by scraping, aliquoted in RPMI, and treated with CsA (50 μg/ml), NIM811 (10 μg/ml), SFA (10 μg/ml), or no inhibitors (aliquot of solvent Me2SO). Samples were taken 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h after beginning of drug treatment, and cell lysates were separated in 14% SDS-PAA gels. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with specific antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. For internal controls blots were stripped for 20 min in 2% mercaptoethanol and 1% SDS at 65 °C and a re-incubated with antibodies specific for actin and CypA.Plasmids and Antibodies—The pCMV-FLAG-Vpr DNA plasmid directs the expression of HIV-1NL4–3 Vpr with the FLAG epitope at the N terminus (47Kino T. Gragerov A. Kopp J.B. Stauber R.H. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The pCMV-3HA-Vpr vector was used to express Vpr with an N-terminal hemagglutin (HA) tag of HIV-1NL4–3 (21Sherman M.P. de Noronha C.M. Pearce D. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8159-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mutations at proline residues 5, 10, 14, and 35 were introduced by designing PCR primers containing the indicated changes and cloning into the plasmid directly. The plasmid pNLenv1 represents an env-deleted version of HIV-1NL4–3 (46Schubert U. Clouse K.A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7699-7711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for FLAG, actin, and HA were obtained from Sigma, the CypA antibody was from Calbiochem, and the Vpr antibody was as described (13Henklein P. Bruns K. Sherman M.P. Tessmer U.

The peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Dianova.In Vitro and in Vivo Complex Formation of Vpr and CypA—1 μg of each, recombinant CypA (Calbiochem) and sVpr, were incubated in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, at 22 °C for 12 h. Aliquots of the mixture were denatured in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (without reducing agents), incubated at room temperature for 30 min, separated in a 12.5% PAA gel, and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-CypA (Calbiochem) and anti-Vpr (R-96) antibodies. For co-immunoprecipitation, 3 × 107 HeLa cells transfected with pCMV-FLAG-Vpr were lysed in lysis buffer (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1% (w/v) digitonin (Wako)), and the cytosolic fraction was isolated by centrifugation (4 °C, 15 min, 14,000 × g) and incubated with anti-FLAG antibodies for 12 h at 4 °C.

The nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of the C family members are relatively divergent compared with many ABC proteins. They also differ in their ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP. In MRP1, NBD1 binds ATP with high affinity, whereas NBD2 is hydrolytically more active. Furthermore, ATP binding and/or hydrolysis by NBD2 of MRP1, but not NBD1, is required for MRP1 to shift from a high to low affinity substrate binding state. Little is known of the structural basis for these functional differences. One minor structural difference between NBDs is the presence of Asp COOH-terminal to the conserved core Walker B motif in NBD1, rather than the more commonly found Glu present in NBD2. We show that the presence of Asp or Glu following the Walker B motif profoundly affects the ability of the NBDs to bind, hydrolyze, and release nucleotide. An Asp to Glu mutation in NBD1 enhances its hydrolytic capacity and affinity for ADP but markedly decreases transport activity. In contrast, mutations that eliminate the negative charge of the Asp side chain have little effect. The decrease in transport caused by the Asp to Glu mutation in NBD1 is associated with an inability of MRP1 to shift from high to low affinity substrate binding states. In contrast, mutation of Glu to Asp markedly increases the affinity of NBD2 for ATP while decreasing its ability to hydrolyze ATP and to release ADP. This mutation eliminates transport activity but potentiates the conversion from a high to low affinity binding state in the presence of nucleotide. These observations are discussed in the context of catalytic models proposed for MRP1 and other ABC drug transport proteins. MRP1 belongs to subfamily “C” of the ABC transporter superfamily.

Multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 1 (ABCC1) belongs to the “C” subfamily of the ABC superfamily and was discovered by virtue of its ability to cause multidrug resistance when overexpressed in a human small cell lung cancer cell line (1Cole S.P.C.

The MRP1 multidrug resistance phenotype is similar to that resulting from overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-GP), and involves resistance to many relatively hydrophobic, natural product type, cytotoxic agents. However, unlike P-GP, MRP1 can also transport various structurally unrelated organic anionic conjugates, including: glutathione, glucuronide, and sulfate conjugates, such as the potent mediator of inflammation, cysteinyl leukotriene LTC4, the cholestatic glucuronide-conjugated estrogen E217βG, the sulfate conjugate estrone 3-sulfate, and the glutathione epoxide conjugate of the highly mutagenic aflatoxin B1 (3Cole S.P.

Typically, the functional form of ABC proteins consists of two hydrophilic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) located at the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane and two hydrophobic transmembrane spanning domains (MSD) that are thought to form the translocation pathway. The predicted topology of some of the ABCC transporters such as MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, MRP6, and MRP7, as well SUR1 and SUR2, is unusual in that it includes an additional NH2-terminal MSD that probably contains five transmembrane segments and has an extracellular NH2 terminus (11Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H. Grant C.E. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23623-23630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 12Kast C. Gros P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29122-29129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The NBDs of ABC proteins contain three conserved motifs required for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis: the Walker A and B motifs (14Walker J.E. Eberle A. Gay N.J. Runswick M.J. Saraste M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1982; 10: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the ABC signature sequence (LSGGQ) or C-motif (15Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis and substrate transport is strongly dependent on cooperativity between the NBDs. In P-GP, inactivation of either NBD by mutation of essential residues in the Walker A motif completely abolishes ATP-dependent transport activity (16Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4592-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Azzaria M. Schurr E. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5289-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The NBDs of P-GP can also be exchanged without loss of function and in the original model proposed for the catalytic cycle of P-GP (18Beaudet L. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17159-17170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the alternating hydrolysis of one ATP molecule by either NBD results in transport of one molecule of substrate (19Senior A.E. al Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 20Senior A.E. Bhagat S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). More recently, a variation of this model has been proposed in which one ATP hydrolysis event results in substrate transport and hydrolysis of a second ATP is required to restore the protein to a high affinity substrate binding state (21Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Whether or not each NBD is limited to a distinct role in the transport process has not been established. However, studies of P-GP in which positions of NBDs were exchanged suggest that the location of the NBD in the protein may influence its ability to bind and hydrolyze nucleotide. Thus although interchangeable without loss of function, the NBDs may not be functionally identical in the intact transporter (18Beaudet L. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17159-17170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Germann U.A. Cheng P.W. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13887-13899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical evidence in the E. coli histidine permease suggests that its two identical HisP subunits may be functionally asymmetric (23Kreimer D.I. Chai K.P. Ferro-Luzzi A.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14183-14195Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Compared with many transporters, the NBDs of ABCC proteins are structurally relatively divergent such that there is greater similarity between comparable NBDs in different ABCC members than between NBDs in the same protein (24Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13098-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A considerable body of evidence also indicates that NBDs within a single protein differ functionally. We and others have shown that in MRP1, the NBDs differ considerably with respect to ATP binding and vanadate-dependent trapping of ADP (24Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17626-17630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although trapping of ADP by NBD2 of MRP1 requires that NBD1 be able to bind and possibly to hydrolyze ATP, the binding of ATP by NBD1 is preserved when NBD2 is inactivated by essential mutations in its Walker A motif (24Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13098-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 25Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20280-20287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Inactivation of each NBD also has different effects on transport activity. A number of NBD1 mutations that eliminate ATP hydrolysis and diminish ATP binding decrease transport activity by only 60–70%, whereas comparable NBD2 mutations inactivate the protein (24Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13098-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The different effects of these mutations strongly suggest that the catalytic cycle of MRP1 differs from that first proposed for P-GP and prokaryotic transporters with two essentially identical NBDs (16Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4592-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 29Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To begin defining the structural basis of the functional differences between the two NBDs of MRP1, we have examined the role of the acidic residue immediately COOH-proximal to the highly conserved core of the Walker B motif. In NBD1, this residue is Asp, whereas in NBD2, it is Glu, as is found in the NBDs of most ABC proteins (Fig. 1). The function of this Glu residue had been studied in several ABC transporters, such as HisP and P-GP, but its role in the catalytic cycle remains controversial. In HisP, mutation of this residue to Gln results in a protein able to bind ATP but with no detectable ATPase activity (30Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 31Moody J.E. Millen L. Binns D. Hunt J.F. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21111-21114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Comparable mutations in NBD1 and NBD2 of the P-GP murine homologue, mdr3, result in loss of ATPase activity but the protein can trap ADP at the mutated NBD in the presence of vanadate, suggesting that ADP release is impaired (32Urbatsch I.L. Julien M. Carrier I. Rousseau M.E. Cayrol R. Gros P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14138-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, similar studies of human P-GP found that although ADP release was impaired when the corresponding Glu residues in both NBDs were mutated to Gln, single mutants in either NBD were able to release ADP but unable to proceed through a second catalytic cycle (33Sauna Z.E. Muller M. Peng X.H. Ambudkar S.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13989-14000Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To investigate the roles played by Asp793 and Glu1455 adjacent to the core Walker B NBD1 and NBD2 motifs of MRP1, respectively, we have both exchanged these residues and mutated them to a number of amino acids lacking carboxylate side chains. The mutations have been expressed singly and in combination using a baculovirus dual expression system we have described previously, which enables highly efficient reconstitution of a functional transporter from two “half-molecules” that can be readily separated by SDS-PAGE (34Gao M. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27782-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus quantitative effects of the mutations on nucleotide binding, trapping, and release by individual NBDs can be easily assessed (24Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13098-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Similarly, the influence of mutations on the ability of the high affinity MRP1 substrate, LTC4, to photolabel sites in the second and third MSDs can also be determined (35Qian Y.M. Qiu W. Gao M. Westlake C.J. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38636-38644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that differences between the ATP binding and hydrolysis characteristics of the two NBDs of MRP1 are attributable in large part to the presence of Asp rather than Glu adjacent to the NBD1 Walker B motif at position 793. In addition, we demonstrate that contrary to expectations based on the alternating site model of catalysis, increasing the hydrolytic activity of NBD1 by introduction of Glu in place of Asp decreases rather than increases transport of LTC4. This decrease in transport activity is associated with an increase in ADP trapping at the mutant NBD1 and a marked reduction in trapping by the co-expressed wild-type NBD2. Finally, we present evidence that conversion of the protein from a high affinity substrate binding conformation to a low affinity transition state occurs when NBD2 is occupied by either ATP or ADP and is prevented when NBD1 is occupied by ADP.

MRP1 cDNA Mutation—The pFBDual-MRP1 1–932/932-1531 construct (pFBDual-halves, pFBDual-D123/D45) was cloned into pFASTBAC Dual (Invitrogen). This construct, encoding the NH2- and COOH-proximal half-molecules of MRP1, has been described by Gao et al. (24Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

The Glu793 and Asp1455 mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a Clontech transformer kit. The templates used for site-directed mutagenesis, pGEM-NBD1 and pGEM-NBD2, were described previously (24Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

The forward primers for D793E and E1455D were 5′-CCTCTTCGATGAGCCCCTCTCAGC-3′ and 5′-CTTGTGTTGGATGATGCCACGGCAGC-3′, respectively. The presence of the mutation and the fidelity of the sequence of the MRP1 coding region were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (ACGT Corp., Ontario, Canada). The Bsu36I-SphI fragments bearing mutations at NBD1 were isolated from pGEM-NBD1 and used to replace the same region in pFBDual-halves to create pFBDual-halves/D793E. The EcoRI-KpnI fragments with mutations at NBD2 were isolated from pGEM-NBD2 and used to replace the equivalent region in pBS-Asp45 to generate pBS-D45/E1455D. This was then digested with NcoI and KpnI and the NcoI-KpnI fragment was used to replace the equivalent region of pFBDual-Asp45 to give pFBDual-D45/E1455D. Finally, the SalI-XbaI fragment of pFBDual-halves was isolated and cloned into pFBDual-D45/E1455D, which had been digested with the same enzymes, to generate pFBDual-halves/E1455D. In the D793E/E1455D double mutant, the SalI-XbaI fragment with the mutation in NBD1 was isolated and ligated to pFBDual-D45/E1455D, which had been digested with the same enzymes, to generate pFBDual-halves/D793E/E1455D.

Various MRP1 polypeptide amounts were estimated by comparison with Sf21 cell-expressed wild-type MRP1 loaded using the same conditions. Densitometry of the film images was performed using a ChemiImager™ 4000 (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). The relative protein expression levels were calculated by dividing the integrated densitometry values obtained for 0.5 and 1.0 μg of total membrane protein from infected cells expressing the mutant proteins by the integrated densitometry values obtained for the comparable amounts of total membrane proteins from infected cells expressing the wild-type protein. Each comparison was performed three times in independent experiments. The results were then pooled, and the mean values were determined.

The pH of vanadate solution was adjusted to 10 using 2 m HCl and boiled for 10 min. The solution must become colorless. Just before using, this solution must be boiled 10 min and diluted to 10 mm with transport buffer. Membrane vesicles (20 μg of protein) were resuspended in transport buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2, and 1–15 μm 8-azido-32P-nucleotide (ALT Corp.; specific activity between 5 and 20 Ci mmol–1). Unless otherwise indicated in the figure legend, the 15-min incubation at 37 °C was performed in the presence or absence of 1 mm vanadate. The reaction was started by addition of 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP, 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, or 8-azido-[α-32P]ADP and stopped by transfer on ice and addition of ice-cold buffer as previously described. Unreacted nucleotides were then removed (2×) by addition of 150 μl of ice-cold buffer followed by centrifugation. Pellets were resuspended in 14 μl of ice-cold buffer and vesicle membranes were irradiated for 7 min on ice in a Stratalinker UV cross-linker (λ = 302 nm) as previously described by Gao et al. (24Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13098-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). After the addition of Laemmli buffer (4×), containing dithiothreitol (100 mm final), membrane vesicles were electrophoresed on gradient SDS-PAGE (7–15%). After drying for 2 h at 80 °C, gels were autoradiographed in a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiographed using Kodak Bio-Max MS films. Transport of [3H]LTC4 into Insect Membrane Vesicles—Uptake of [3H]LTC4 (50 nm, 182 Ci mmol–1, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) into membrane vesicles was measured at 23 °C in the presence of ATP (4 mm) or AMP (4 mm) using a rapid filtration technique as previously described (7Loe D.W.

Photoaffinity Labeling by MRP1 with [3H]LTC4—Unless otherwise indicated in the figure legend, insect membrane vesicles (75 μg of protein in 20 μl) were incubated with [3H]LTC4 (0.13 μCi, 200 nm) at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were then frozen in liquid nitrogen (1 min), followed by UV irradiation (1 min). This was repeated 10 times. Radiolabeled vesicles were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (7–15%). Proteins were fixed by 25% isopropyl alcohol, 65% water, and 10% acid acetic, for 30 min, and gels were dried at 80 °C for 2 h and autoradiographed on Kodak Bio-Max MS films (35Qian Y.M. Qiu W.

Wild-type and various mutant MRP1 half-molecules were co-expressed in Sf21 cells infected with baculovirus dual-expression vectors. The levels of co-expressed MRP1 fragments in membrane vesicles from infected cells were then determined by immunoblotting, using the rat mAb MRPr1 (epitope amino-acids 238–247) and murine mAb MRPm6 (epitope amino-acids 1511–1520) to detect NH2- and COOH-proximal fragments, respectively. Membrane vesicles from insect cells infected with a β-Gus baculovirus construct were used as a negative control. No MRP1 specific binding was detected by mAb MRPr1 and mAb MRPm6 in cells infected with the β-Gus vector. Effect of D793E and E1455D Single and Double Mutations on LTC4 Transport Activity—LTC4 uptake by membrane vesicles from Sf21 cells expressing wild-type and mutant MRP1 half-molecules was determined at 23 °C, as described by Loe et al. (7Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The expression levels of mutant and wild-type proteins were determined to be comparable by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A) and transport activity values have not been normalized. Uptake at 3 min, by vesicles containing the D793E mutant NH2-terminal fragment and the wild-type COOH-proximal half was ∼20% of that obtained with vesicles containing two wild-type fragments. The transport activity of vesicles containing either the E1455D mutant fragment and the wild-type NH2-terminal half, or co-expressed D793E and E1455D mutant fragments was similar to that of the β-Gus control (Fig. 2B). Thus the effects of the D793E and E1455D mutations on LTC4 transport were similar to previously described mutations of the Walker A motif that eliminate ATP hydrolysis and decrease ATP binding by NBD1 and NBD2, respectively (24Gao M.

In this study, CVX, purified from venom, behaves as expected, i.e. it binds to platelet GPVI and recombinant human GPVI, induces platelet aggregation and platelet prothrombinase activity, and binds uniquely to GPVI in ligand blots of SDS-denatured proteins. Nonetheless, we find that CVX has a dual specificity for both GPVI and native but not denatured human GPIbα. First, CVX binds to human GPIbα expressed on the surface of CHO cells. Second, CVX binds weakly to murine platelet GPIbα but more strongly to human platelet GPIbα, as evidenced by comparative binding to wild-type, GPVI(–/–), FcRγ (–/–), and human GPIb transgenic mice. Third, the binding of CVX to human GPIbα is inhibited by soluble, recombinant human GPVI. Fourth, CVX binding to GPIbα is disrupted by phenylalanine substitutions at GPIbα tyrosine-276, tyrosine-278, and tyrosine-279, which also disrupts von Willebrand factor and α-thrombin binding to GPIbα. Fifth, CVX binding to GPIbα on Chinese hamster ovary cell transfectants is inhibited by function-blocking murine monoclonal anti-GPIbα antibodies. Lastly, CVX fails to bind to denatured GPIbα in detergent extracts of platelets. Three separate preparations of CVX (two purified by the authors; one obtained commercially) produced equivalent results. These results indicate that CVX exhibits dual specificity for both native GPIbα and GPVI. Furthermore, the binding site on GPIbα for CVX may be close to that for von Willebrand factor.

Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N.C. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27035-27041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The active protein is composed of two disulfide-linked subunits, CVXα (13.9 kDa) and CVXβ (12.6 kDa), which noncovalently assemble into a tridimeric complex (α β)3 (3Nidergang F. Alcover A. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Francischetti I.M.B. Bon C. Leduc M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Both subunits have been cloned and sequenced and exhibit homology with the carbohydrate recognition domain of C-type lectins (4Leduc M. Bon C. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 5Andrews R.K. Kamiguti A.S. Berlanga O. Leduc M. Theakston R.D. Watson S.P. Haemostasis. 2001; 31: 155-172PubMed Google Scholar). C-type snake proteins are produced in the venom of numerous true vipers and pit vipers (5Andrews R.K. Kamiguti A.S. Berlanga O. Leduc M. Theakston R.D. Watson S.P. Haemostasis. 2001; 31: 155-172PubMed Google Scholar). They can be composed of homodimers or heterodimers, often present in multiples, each subunit exhibiting homology to the carbohydrate recognition domain of C-type lectins. Unlike the C-type lectins, however, the subunits of the heterodimeric C-type proteins, such as CVX, do not retain the mannose or galactose recognition sequences and, thus, no longer bind carbohydrate. The ability to bind calcium is retained and may be critical for their activity. A number of the C-type viper venom proteins target platelet receptors, including the glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) complex and GPVI. The majority, including alboaggregin A (6Dormann D. Clemetson J.M. Navdaev A. Kehrel B.E. Clemetson K.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and alboluxin (7Du X. Magnenat E. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 87: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), exhibit dual specificity for these receptors, whereas only CVX and the lesser studied trimucytin (8Teng C.M. Ko F.N. Tsai I.H. Hung M.L. Huang T.F. Thromb. Haemost. 1993; 69: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) bind selectively to GPVI. CVX is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation in vitro, acting presumably through mechanism(s) that are initiated by its binding to GPVI (1Polgar J. Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N.C. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13576-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 2Jandrot-Perrus M. Lagrue A.H. Okuma M. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27035-27041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The strongest evidence that CVX binds uniquely to GPVI is derived from its selective binding in Western blot assays. CVX binds so selectively to GPVI in detergent-solubilized platelet protein preparations that it can be used to quantitate this receptor (9Furihata K. Clemetson K.J. Deguchi H. Kunicki T.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1857-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) within the milieu of total platelet proteins. Naturally, this method would not detect binding that might require a native conformation of a target protein. Conversely, the strongest evidence that GPIb is not involved in CVX-induced platelet activation lies in the failure of numerous inhibitory anti-GPIb antibodies (2Jandrot-Perrus M. Lagrue A.H. Okuma M. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27035-27041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) to significantly block its activity. This conclusion relies on the assumption that the epitopes on GPIb that are occupied by von Willebrand factor (VWF) are identical to or sufficiently proximal to epitopes occupied by CVX. Given these caveats, the unique specificity of CVX for GPVI has not been challenged, and it has become the archetypical GPVI-specific agonist. During the course of our own studies of the effects of CVX on platelet function, particularly studies using stable, transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines and receptor-deficient or transgenic mice, we noted a number of results that are inconsistent with a unique specificity of CVX for GPVI. In this report, we summarize our systematic re-evaluation of the specificity of CVX and provide conclusive evidence that CVX binds to the native conformation of human but not mouse GPIbα. In view of these findings, the exact contribution of GPVI vis-à-vis the GPIb complex to platelet activation by CVX needs to be carefully reinvestigated. Purification and Labeling of CVX—CVX was purified from Crotalus durissus terrificus venom (Miami Serpentarium Laboratories, Punta Gorda, FL) as described previously (9Furihata K. Clemetson K.J. Deguchi H. Kunicki T.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1857-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, 250 mg of lyophilized venom was dissolved in 8 ml of 300 mm NaCl, 100 mm ammonium formate, pH 3.5 (buffer A) containing the following protease inhibitors: Pefabloc-SC (1 μg/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), l-1-chloro-3[4-tosyl-amido]-7-amino-2-heptanone (50 μg/ml), N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (100 μg/ml), benzamidine (10 mm), leupeptin (4 μm), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), 5 mm EDTA, and 0.05% NaN3. Insoluble components were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded on a column (16 × 1200-mm) packed with Sephacryl S-300HR (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated with buffer A. Two-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and each was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining of the gels. Fractions that showed a band at 85 kDa under nonreduced conditions and two bands of 14 and 16 kDa under reduced conditions were further analyzed for their ability to induce platelet aggregation. Before the platelet aggregation assays, each fraction was neutralized with 1/10 volume of 1 m Tris, pH 8.5. Fractions positive by both SDS-PAGE and platelet aggregating activity were pooled, concentrated in a Speed-Vac, and then dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% sodium azide. Purified CVX was made to 2 mm EDTA and kept at 4 °C. During the course of these studies, two separate batches of CVX were purified from a single lot of C. durissus venom and are designated CVX.1 and CVX.2. CVX was also obtained commercially from Pentapharm, Ltd. (Basel, Switzerland) and is referred to as CVX.P. To prepare biotin-conjugated CVX, purified CVX in PBS, pH 7.4, at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was mixed with 1/100 volume of Sulfo-NHS-LC biotin (Molecular Probes) dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 10 mg/ml to give a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. After 2 h incubation at ambient temperature, the mixture was extensively dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% sodium azide to remove free biotin. Recombinant Soluble Human GPVI—Soluble GPVI cDNA was constructed from full-length GPVI cDNA by PCR using the forward primer BglII-WT containing a 5′ BglII restriction site (5′-AGATCTCAGAGTGGACCGCTCCCCAAG-3′) and the reverse primer XbaI-GP6R containing a 3′ XbaI restriction site (5′-TCTAGAGTTGCCCTTGGTGTAGTACTG-3′). After verifying the nucleotide sequence, the PCR-amplified cDNA was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into the Drosophila expression vector pMT/BiP/V5-His (Invitrogen) at BglII and EcoRI sites to enable expression of the GPVI sequence from glutamine-21 through phenylalanine-223 followed by His6. To establish stable Drosophila S2 cell lines expressing soluble GPVI, a selection vector pPac-HygB was developed by inserting the Hygromycin B resistance gene, amplified by PCR from the pREP4 vector (Invitrogen), into the Drosophila expression vector pPac. The GPVI cDNA construct and pPac-HygB were cotransfected into S2 cells at a ratio of 20:1 using the Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were grown for 48 h in the presence of the DNA mixture and then cultured in medium containing 300 μg/ml Hygromycin B for 4 weeks. Stable cell lines survived this selection and were transferred to serum-free medium (Invitrogen). Secretion of soluble GPVI into the culture medium was induced by addition of 500 μm copper sulfate. His6-tagged soluble GPVI was purified from harvested culture supernatants by adsorption/elution from a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The presence of purified, soluble GPVI was established by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Using biotin-CVX as the detection reagent, purified recombinant GPVI migrates as a single protein band with an MW App of 45,000 under nonreduced conditions. cDNA Constructs—The cDNAs for GPIbβ and GPIX were cloned into the tetracycline (Tet)-OFF expression vector, pTRE (Clontech). The cDNA encoding GPIbα was cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pCDNA3.1Zeo (Invitrogen). The cDNA encoding GPVI and FcRγ were cloned into 3.1(+) and pcDNA3.1(+)/myc-His B, respectively. We generated a mutant GPIbα3F, by using the Quick Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GPIbα3F is a mutant in which three tyrosine residues (276, 278, and 279) critical for VWF binding have been replaced with phenylalanines. CHO Cell Transfectants—CHO cells were maintained in 5% CO2 and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.5 mm nonessential amino acids, and 2 mm l-glutamine (Whittaker Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD). A CHO cell line expressing the Tet-controlled transactivator (CHO-AA8, Tet-Off) was purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech. Transfection of CHO cells was performed using liposome (TransFast, Promega, Madison, WI). A stable CHO cell line was established that expresses human GPIbβ and human GPIX, cloned into the Tet-OFF expression vector pTRE, and the selection plasmid, pTK/Hyg (CHO:(tβ/IX)). pTK/Hyg facilitates selection of stable transformants with hygromycin (800 μg/ml, Invitrogen). Because of pTRE, the presence of Tet (200 ng/ml) represses expression of both GPIbβ and GPIX, whereas the removal of Tet induces both gene products. The cell line CHO:(tβ/IX) was transfected with the plasmid pCDNA3.1Zeo in which were cloned the wild-type human GPIbα to generate CHO:(tβ/IX)α or the mutant GPIbα3F to generate CHO:(tβ/IX)α3F. In the case of the CHO:VI(tβ/IX)α cell, we transfected the cDNA of human wild-type GPIbα and GPVI/FCRγ into the CHO:(tβ/IX) cell. This cell line constitutively expresses GPIbα and GPVI/FcRγ, whereas the expression of GPIbβ and GPIX remains Tet-repressible. After culture for 10 days in the presence of Zeocin (800 μg/ml, Invitrogen), we selected single colonies and further cultured these for 2 weeks to establish stable clones. Surface expression of recombinant GPIbα was analyzed by flow cytometry using FITC-LJ-P3 (10Handa M. Titani K. Holland L.Z. Roberts J.R. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12579-12585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clones exhibiting comparable high expression levels were selected. Expression of GPVI was analyzed by Western blotting using LJ6.5. Mice—C57BL/6J mice are referred to as wild-type. Mice deficient in FcRγ were kindly provided by Prof. Toshiyuki Takai (Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan). Mice deficient in murine GPIbα and having a human GPIbα transgene were described previously (11Ware J. Russell S. Ruggeri Z.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2803-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in GPVI were established as described by Kato et al. (12Kato K. Kanaji T. Russell S. Kunicki T.J. Furihata K. Kanaji S. Marchese P. Reininger A. Ruggeri Z.M. Ware J. Blood. 2003; 102: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A 9-kb HindIII restriction fragment spanning mouse GPVI gene exons I–III was cloned into pBS/KS–. Within this subcloned fragment a premature stop codon was created immediately 3′ to the initiation codon by double-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Stratagene). A unique restriction site was also added 3′ to the premature stop codon to allow insertion of a phosphoglycerate kinase-neor cassette (kindly provided by Dr. Richard Hynes, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MO) within exon 1. The final targeting construct contained 4.5-kb arms, both 5′ and 3′, and the 1.7-kb neor selectable marker immediately downstream to the initiating Met codon. The targeting vector was linearized with NotI and electroporated into DS2A embryonic stem (ES) cells at the Dartmouth Transgenic Facility (Lebanon, NH). Transfected cells were selected for G418 resistance, and ∼180 clones were expanded for analysis by Southern blotting. A HincII/HindIII restriction fragment outside the targeting vector sequence was used to probe HincII digests of ES cell DNA. Correct homologous recombination was further confirmed by Southern analysis of XbaI-digested ES cell DNA hybridized with a 1.1-kb fragment containing exons 2 and 3. All probes were labeled by [α-32P]dATP using the Prime-It II Random Primer Labeling kit from Stratagene. Three clones with the predicted homologous recombination event were confirmed with additional probes and PCR analysis to validate the correct generation of a GPVI-targeted allele. The positive ES cells were microinjected into C57BL/6J mouse blastocysts and were implanted into pseudopregnant females. Chimeric mice were bred to C57BL/6J black mice to test for germ-line transmission. Two chimeric mice from different ES cells produced germ-line offspring as assessed by coat color transmission. Heterozygous mice were crossed to produce the three genotypes, WT (GPVI+/+), heterozygous (GPVI+/–), and homozygous-deficient (GPVI–/–). Studies comparing the three genotypes, such as tail bleeding times, were performed blindly on littermates from GPVI+/– × GPVI+/– crosses before genotype analysis. Flow Cytometry—Three μl of whole blood was mixed with 50 μl of PBS containing 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA) and 0.1 μg of biotin-CVX. The mixture was gently agitated and then incubated for 15 min at ambient temperature. Two μl of streptavidin-phycoerythrin (PE; PharMingen) was then added, and the mixture was gently agitated and incubated for an additional 15 min at ambient temperature. To measure the expression of GPIbα, 3 μl of whole blood were mixed with 1 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated LJ-P3 diluted in 50 μl of PBS-BSA. One ml of PBS was added to each sample mixture just before the FACS assay. Measurements were obtained using a Becton Dickinson FACScan, and the data were reported as geometric mean fluorescence intensity (GMFI). Data analysis was performed using WinMDI 2.8. 2Internet address: facs.Scripps.edu/software.html. Western Blot—Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 1% SDS. Twenty μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically onto a Sequi-Blot polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Nonspecific binding of proteins was blocked by incubation of the membrane for 60 min in a solution of 5% fat-free milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 145 mm NaCl (TBS) plus 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T). The membrane was then incubated with anti-GPVI antibody LJ6.5 (10 μg/ml in TBS-T) for 120 min at room temperature. After three subsequent rinses in fresh TBS-T, the membrane was further incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in TBS-T at room temperature for 60 min. After a final three rinses in TBS-T, bound LJ6.5 visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Purification and Characterization of CVX—CVX.1 and CVX.2 used in the present study were purified as described (9Furihata K. Clemetson K.J. Deguchi H. Kunicki T.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1857-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). CVX.1 is the same batch used in studies published previously, where it was shown to induce platelet aggregation in citrated platelet-rich plasma at concentrations ≥20 pm, stimulate platelet prothrombinase activity, and bind exclusively to GPVI (and not at all to GPIbα) in ligand blot assays of total SDS-denatured platelet proteins (9Furihata K. Clemetson K.J. Deguchi H. Kunicki T.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1857-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). CVX.2, purified more recently, has the same biological properties as CVX.1 but differs slightly in composition (or conformation). In SDS-PAGE, under nonreduced conditions (Fig. 1), higher molecular weight components are visible in the biotinylated CVX.1 preparation that are not present in biotinylated CVX.2 or CVX.P. Although these might represent contaminants, it is more likely that they are additional oligomers of CVX, because only the anticipated α and β subunits of CVX (14 and 16 kDa, respectively) are detected in each preparation after reduction. CVX.1 was prepared more than 2 years before CVX.2 and had been stored at 4 °C in 0.05% (w/v) NaN3, which may account for a gradual accumulation of larger molecular weight entities. Nonetheless, subsequent studies (see below) would demonstrate that all three CVX preparations have the same specificities. CVX Binds to Human GPIbα Expressed on the Surface of CHO Cells—To confirm the specificity of purified CVX for denatured, recombinant human GPVI and its lack of reactivity with denatured, recombinant human GPIbα, we used a panel of stable CHO cell transfectants (Table I). First, a stable CHO cell line was established that expresses human GPIbβ and human GPIX under the control of Tet-responsive elements (CHO:(tβ IX)). This cell line was then transfected with either WT human GPIbα or mutated human GPIbα (GPIbα3F) to generate CHO: (tβ IX)α and CHO:(tβ IX)α3F, respectively. Because the surface expression of GPIbα depends upon the simultaneous expression of both GPIbβ and GPIX, addition of Tet represses the expression of the GPIb complex. Using CHO:(tβ/IX), we also established CHO:VI(tβ IX)α, in which human GPIbα, human GPVI, and human FcRγ were stably cotransfected. In this CHO cell line, expression of GPVI and FcRγ are constitutive, whereas the expression of the GPIb complex remains controllable by Tet. In each of the subsequent figures depicting flow cytometry results, a single representative experiment is shown. In each case, the results were confirmed in two or more independent experiments.Table IStable, transfected CHO cell lines used in this studyHuman platelet glycoproteins expressedCHO cell lineTet-responsiveConstitutiveIbβGPIXIbαIbα3FGPVICHO:(tβIX)XXCHO:(tβIX)αXXXCHO:(tβIX)α3FXXXCHO:VI(tβIX)αXXXX Open table in a new tab With these stable transfectants in hand, we compared the binding of biotin-CVX.1 and the GPIbα-specific murine monoclonal antibody LJ-P3 to CHO:(tβ/IX) and CHO:(tβ/IX)α (Fig. 2A). Lacking GPIbα, CHO:(tβ/IX) is not bound by LJ-P3 (Fig. 2A, upper left panel) or biotin-CVX.1 (Fig. 2A, lower left panel) either in the absence (Fig. 2A, dense curve) or presence (Fig. 2A, thin curve) of Tet. On the other hand, CHO:(tβ/IX)α, which expresses human GPIbα under the control of Tet, is bound by LJ-P3 (Fig. 2A, upper right panel) and biotin-CVX.1 (Fig. 2A, lower right panel) in the absence of Tet but not in the presence of Tet. The subtle increase in binding of LJ-P3 to CHO:(tβ/IX)α (GMFI, 3.77) compared with CHO:(tβ/IX) (GMFI, 1.73) in the presence of 200 ng/ml of Tet probably reflects a very low level of GPIbα surface expression in the absence of the β/IX subunits. In the absence of β/IX, GPIbα can be detected on the surface of transfected CHO cells as a dimer. 3T. Kanaji, unpublished observation. Next, using CHO:VI(tβIX)α, we measured CVX binding to GPVI versus GPIbα. As shown in Fig. 2B (left panel), the presence of Tet results in a 9-fold reduction in the binding LJ-P3 to CHO:VI(tβIX)α. (GMFI shifts from 22.14 to 2.41 in the presence of Tet.) At the same time, the binding of biotin-CVX decreases by roughly one-half (Fig. 2B, right panel). No significant change in synthesis of GPVI was observed in the presence or absence of Tet, as determined by Western blot assay with murine monoclonal anti-GPVI antibody LJ6.5 (Fig. 2C). In the case of CHO:(tβ/IX)α (negative control), no GPVI was detected in lysates of cells cultured in the absence of Tet (Fig. 2C, left lane). In the case of CHO:VI(tβ/IX)α, GPVI synthesis is constitutive, and the level of the GPVI band is equivalent in cells cultured in the absence (Fig. 2C, center lane) or presence of 200 ng/ml Tet (Fig. 2C, right lane). These results suggest that CVX can bind to both human GPVI and human GPIbα. CVX Binds Closely to the Sequence 276–279 of GPIbα— A mutant form of GPIbα, generated by site-directed mutagenesis, was used to further localize the CVX binding site. In GPIbα3F, three tyrosine residues (276, 278, and 279) critical for VWF binding (Fig. 3A) have been replaced with phenylalanines (13Marchese P. Murata M. Mazzucato M. Pradella P. De Marco L. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9571-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As shown in the figure, the tyrosine 278 and 279 residues are not conserved in the murine VWF sequence. By flow cytometry (Fig. 3B), the binding of anti-GPIbα (LJP3) and biotin-CVX.1 to CHO cells transfected with WT (CHO: (tβ IX)α) and mutated human GPIbα (CHO:(tβ IX)α3F) are compared. Tet-repressible binding of both LJ-P3 (Fig. 3B, upper panels) and biotin-CVX.1 (Fig. 3B, lower panels) is apparent in the case of CHO:(tβ IX)α (Fig. 3B, left), which expresses the WT human GPIbα. The expression of the GPIbα3F mutant (Fig. 3B, right) had no effect on LJ-P3 binding but resulted in a virtual elimination of CVX.1 binding. Previous studies had established that LJ-P3 binds equally well to both GPIbα and GPIBα3F. These results indicate that the three tyrosines in the sequence 276–279 of GPIbα are necessary for the binding of CVX. These findings imply that a qualitative defect in the ability of GPIbα to bind VWF (as observed in the case of GPIbα3F) may also negatively influence the binding of CVX. It remains to be determined whether the GPIbα sequence 276–279 is directly involved in the binding of CVX or exerts an important allosteric effect on the binding site. Once again, the specificity of CVX.1 for GPIbα was confirmed in each case by the marked decline in binding after cells were incubated in the presence of Tet. CVX Binding to GPIbα Is Inhibited by Function-blocking Anti-GPIbα Antibody—Further evidence is consistent with an interpretation that CVX binds close to or at the VWF binding region of GPIbα. Competition experiments were conducted with the murine monoclonal antibody LJ-Ib1 that inhibits VWF binding to GPIbα (Fig. 4). CVX.1 binding to GPIbα expressed by CHO:(tβ IX)α in the absence of Tet is inhibited by function-blocking anti-GPIbα antibody LJ-Ib1 (Fig. 4, left panel) but not by a second anti-GPIbα antibody LJ-Ibα 1 (Fig. 4, right panel), which recognizes a sequence distinct from the VWF binding region of GPIbα. LJ-Ib1 and LJ-Ibα1 were chosen because of their selective binding to different epitopes on GPIbα. LJ-Ib1 is a selective inhibitor of VWF binding to GPIbα (10Handa M. Titani K. Holland L.Z. Roberts J.R. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12579-12585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas LJ-Ibα1 is a non-inhibitory antibody that recognizes an epitope within residues 1–237 (10Handa M. Titani K. Holland L.Z. Roberts J.R. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12579-12585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together with the results obtained above with mutant GPIbα, these results are consistent with an interpretation that CVX is binding to a site close to the VWF binding region of GPIbα. The Binding of CVX to Human GPIbα Expressed on the Surface of CHO Transfectants Is Inhibited by Soluble, Recombinant GPVI—To further eliminate the possibility that the binding of CVX preparations to two distinct receptors is the result of more than one constituent, we measured the ability of recombinant human GPVI to compete with the binding of CVX.1 to GPIbα (Fig. 5). The binding of CVX.1 to CHO:(tβ/IX)α (in the absence of Tet) is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by soluble, recombinant human GPVI. A 20-fold molar excess of human GPVI (27.6 pmol; Fig. 5, dashed curve) results in a 70% decrease in the binding of CVX.1. An intermediate level of inhibition is seen in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of human GPVI (Fig. 5, normal curve). This indicates that there is dose-dependent, competitive binding of CVX to both GPVI and GPIbα. On the basis of these results, it is unlikely that the binding of CVX to GPIbα is attributable to a protein contaminant in the CVX.1 preparation. It is also obvious that residual binding of CVX occurs despite the addition of a 20-fold molar excess of soluble GPVI. This might reflect a lower affinity of CVX for soluble, recombinant GPVI relative to surface-expressed GPIbα.

We recently identified βγ subunit-binding peptides that we proposed bound to a “hot spot” on βγ subunits, stimulating G protein dissociation without stimulating nucleotide exchange and activating G protein signaling in intact cells. AGS3, a member of the activators of G protein signaling family of proteins, also activates G protein signaling in a nucleotide exchange-independent manner, and AGS3 homologues are involved in asymmetric cell division during development. Here we demonstrate that a consensus G protein regulatory (GPR) peptide from AGS3 and related proteins is sufficient to induce G protein subunit dissociation and that both the GPR and hot spot-binding peptides promote dissociation to extents comparable with a known G protein activator, AMF. Peptides derived from adenylyl cyclase 2 and GRK2 prevented formation of the heterotrimeric complex but did not alter the rate of α subunit dissociation from βγ subunits. These data indicate that these nucleotide exchange-independent G protein activator peptides do not simply compete for α interactions with βγ subunits, but actively promote subunit dissociation. Thus, we propose two novel mechanisms for nucleotide exchange independent activation of G protein signaling, one that involves conformational changes in the α subunit and one that involves conformational changes in the βγ subunits.

Heterotrimeric G proteins activated by G protein-coupled receptors mediate a wide variety of cellular processes (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which G protein-coupled receptors activate G proteins have not been fully defined, but involve interactions between the activated receptor, G protein α subunits, and perhaps G protein βγ subunits. This interaction leads to the exchange of GDP for GTP on the G protein α subunit, leading to a conformational change resulting in dissociation of the βγ subunits from the α subunits (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar, 2Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). The free αGTP and βγ subunits interact with downstream targets and regulate their activities. Multiple mechanisms for G protein activation that do not rely on G protein-coupled receptors or even nucleotide exchange are becoming increasingly apparent. We recently identified a receptor independent mechanism for activation of G protein βγ subunit signaling by peptides derived from a random peptide phage display screen that we have proposed bind to a “hot spot” on βγ subunits (3Scott J.K.

Protein interaction hot spots are regions on protein surfaces thought to have unique characteristics suited to driving protein-protein interactions that are often selected for in random peptide screens (5Delano W.L.

AGS3 binds to α subunits and activates the signaling pathway without stimulating nucleotide exchange on the Gα subunit (7Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard S. Duzic E.

Sequences similar to a 25–30 amino acid repeat region in AGS3 were found in multiple other proteins and suggested to be a signature G protein regulatory (GPR) motif (7Takesono A. Cismowski M.J.

This motif was also independently postulated to be a G protein-binding motif and termed the GoLoco motif (9Siderovski D.P. Diverse-Pierluissi M. De Vries L. Trends Biochem.

Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To determine whether the GPR peptides and βγ hot spot-binding peptides uniquely target critical sites on G protein subunits to promote subunit dissociation or if they are simply steric competitors of α-βγ binding, we analyzed and compared the effects of multiple peptides believed to interact at the βγ-α subunit interface for their ability to induce the α subunit dissociation from βγ subunits. We conclude that both the hot spot and GPR motif consensus peptides have the unique ability to dissociate heterotrimers by a mechanism that most likely involves conformational changes in the βγ and α subunits, respectively. Peptides—SIGK, QEHA, and βARK-ct peptide (643–670) were synthesized by Alpha Diagnostics International, purified by high performance liquid chromatography to greater than 90% purity, and their identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. The SIGK peptide was derived from the previously described SIRK (SIRKALNILGYPDYD) peptide using a doping mutagenesis and rescreening strategy (14Gallop M.A. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Fodor S.P. Gordon E.M. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Since SIGK had an apparently higher affinity for βγ than SIRK but whose properties were otherwise similar to SIRK, this peptide was used throughout the studies described here. The sequences of these peptides were as follows: SIGK, SIGKAFKILGYPDYD; QEHA, QEHAQEPERQYMHIGTMVEFAYALVGK; βARK-ct peptide, WKKELRDAYREAQQLVQRVPKMKNKPRS. The GPR consensus motif peptide, TMGEEDFFDLLAKSQSKRMDDQRVDLAG, was synthesized and purified by Biosynthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). All the peptides were dissolved in water. Preparation of Biotinylated β 1 γ 2 Subunits—The cDNA for rat β1 subunit was subcloned into a baculovirus transfer vector for expression of amino-terminal fusions of a biotin acceptor peptide and the biotinylated β1 subunit was expressed as described previously (7Takesono A.

Biotinylated β1γ2 was purified from Sf9 cells using hexahistidine-tagged αi1 following the procedure described previously (15Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Measurement of α-βγ Interactions by Flow Cytometry—Binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled myristoylated αi1 (F-αi1) to biotinylated β1γ2 (b-βγ) subunits was measured using a flow cytometry assay (4Goubaeva F. Ghosh M. Malik S. Yang J. Hinkle P.M. Griendling K.K. Neubig R.R. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19634-19641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Sarvazyan N.A. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7934-7940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). F-αi1 was kindly provided by Dr. Richard Neubig and was prepared by reacting purified myristoylated αi1 with fluorescein isothiocyanate, followed by dialysis and repurification by βγ-agarose chromatography (16Sarvazyan N.A. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7934-7940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The resulting F-αi1 has a specific activity of 11 pmol of [35S]GTPγS bound per μg and 0.9 mol of dye/mol of protein incorporated. Biotinylated βγ (50 pm final concentration) was mixed with streptavidin beads in HEDNMLG buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 150 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm Mg2+, 0.1% C12E10, 10 μm GDP) at room temperature. After 30 min, the beads were washed twice by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge with HEDNMLG buffer and resuspended in the same buffer at 105 beads/ml (50 pm βγ). For α subunit dissociation experiments, the beads with bound 50 pm βγ subunits were premixed with 300 pm F-αi for 10 min prior to the addition of the different peptides or αi1. For equilibrium binding measurements 300 pm F-αi1 and peptides or αi1 were added simultaneously. The amount of F-αi1 bound to beads with b-βγ was assayed at the times indicated in the figure legends using a BD Biosciences FACs Calibur flow cytometer. Nonspecific binding, determined by the simultaneous addition of 300 pm F-αi1 and 50 nm myristoylated αi1 subunits to the b-βγ bound beads, was 10–20% of the total signal and was subtracted from the mean channel numbers from each experiment unless otherwise indicated. Comparison of the βγ Hot Spot-dependent Dissociation Mechanism with AMF-induced Subunit Dissociation—We wanted to determine whether the βγ hot spot-dependent mechanism for subunit dissociation was similar in magnitude to classically described mechanisms for subunit dissociation. AMF (AlF4- plus Mg2+) is a well characterized mediator of G protein subunit dissociation. We chose AMF for the comparison rather than GTP or GTPγS, because the rate of dissociation of the G protein subunits by AMF is not limited by the GDP release rate. To measure αi binding and dissociation from βγ, we used a flow cytometry assay developed by Sarvazyan et al. (16Sarvazyan N.A. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7934-7940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that measures protein α-βγ binding at concentrations of α and βγ near the Kd for their interaction. In this assay, biotinylated βγ (b-βγ) was immobilized on the surface of beads and fluorescein labeled αi1 (F-αi1) was added. F-αi1 that bound to b-βγ on the beads was detected by the flow cytometer. The binding was concentration-dependent, and on and off rates could be measured. To demonstrate that the βγ hot spot-binding peptide (SIGK) and AMF could inhibit α subunit interactions with βγ, they were compared for their effects on the initial binding of F-αi1 to b-βγ. Excess unlabeled myristoylated αi1 was used to measure nonspecific binding. SIGK, AMF, and αi all inhibited formation of the heterotrimeric F-αi1βγ complex to comparable extents, indicating they were equally effective at preventing heterotrimer formation (Fig. 1A). Next we measured the effects of SIGK on subunit dissociation. First we determined the concentration of SIGK required for dissociation of an F-αi1βγ complex (Fig. 1B). Increasing concentrations of SIGK caused a progressive increase in disruption of the preformed complex with maximal dissociation observed between 20 and 30 μm peptide. To compare the SIGK-mediated dissociation rates with AMF, we compared a maximally effective concentration of SIGK with a standard concentration of AMF (30 μm AlCl3, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2) that should be sufficient to activate all of the α subunits (17Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Sternweis P.C. Ross E.M. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 752-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both SIGK and AMF enhanced the release of α subunits from βγ subunits relative to the intrinsic αi1 off rate (measured by addition of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled myristoylated αi1) (Fig. 1C). The k off with AMF was 0.62 min–1 and with SIGK was 0.5 min–1 compared with the intrinsic off rate of 0.1 min–1. The intrinsic off rates are difficult to calculate accurately, because the extent of intrinsic dissociation in this short time course was only 20%. Significantly more intrinsic dissociation occurs with longer time courses, but it is during this initial dissociation phase that the greatest effects of the peptides are observed. Since the off rates induced by SIGK and AMF are similar, it indicates that the βγ subunit-binding peptide-dependent dissociation mechanism has the potential to increase the α-βγ dissociation rate to an extent comparable with the classical G protein α subunit activation dependent dissociation. Effect of MgCl2 on the Rate of α Subunit Dissociation from the Heterotrimeric Complex—Magnesium is known to profoundly affect the interaction of α and βγ subunits, and dissociation by activation of the α subunit with either GTPγS or AlF4- is strongly dependent upon Mg2+concentration (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar, 18Katada T. Northup J.K. Bokoch G.M. Ui M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3578-3585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Magnesium stabilizes interactions of AlF4- and GTPγS at the nucleotide-binding site and directly influences subunit dissociation through an undefined lower affinity site. For the experiment in Fig. 1C, SIGK-mediated dissociation was measured with 1.2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm EDTA (0.2 mm free Mg2+). To determine whether Mg2+ was required for subunit dissociation by SIGK, we measured SIGK-mediated dissociation in the absence of MgCl2, in the presence of 1 mm EDTA (Fig. 1D). SIGK was able to significantly enhance subunit dissociation in the absence of Mg2+, indicating Mg2+ is not required for this dissociation mechanism. Addition of Mg2+at a free concentration of 10 mm increased the intrinsic off rate of F-αi as expected from 0.1 min–1 in the absence of Mg2+ to 0.37 min–1 with 10 mm Mg2+. The rate of α subunit dissociation by SIGK increased from 0.43 min–1 without Mg2+ to 1.14 min–1 with 10 mm Mg2+. Effect of βγ-Binding Peptides on the Interaction of F-α i1 with βγ—Since SIGK and other hot spot-binding peptides enhance the off rate of α from βγ subunits, it suggests they do not act simply by competition for reformation of spontaneously dissociating α-βγ complexes. Such a mechanism would not increase the dissociation rate relative to the intrinsic off rate of α dissociation from βγ. Based on this we have suggested that the peptides stabilize a conformation of βγ subunits that has a lower affinity for α leading to an enhanced rate of α subunit dissociation (4Goubaeva F. Ghosh M. Malik S. Yang J. Hinkle P.M. Griendling K.K. Neubig R.R. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19634-19641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism might be that a small peptide could compete for one of the two major contacts of α subunits with the sides and top of the β subunit torus during transient separation of one of these contacts, thereby leading to an enhancement of the dissociation rate. If there were nothing unique about the hot spot-binding peptides, and it were simply a competitor at the α-βγ interface, this model would predict that any peptide that bound at the α subunit interface with βγ should enhance the off rate. To try to distinguish between these two mechanisms, we tested two βγ-binding peptides thought to bind to βγ subunits at the α subunit interface. QEHA is a 27-residue peptide derived from the second catalytic domain of adenylyl cyclase 2 (amino acids 956–982) and inhibits βγ regulation of several effectors including K+ channels, phospholipase C-β, and adenylyl cyclase (19Chen J. DeVivo M. Dingus J. Harry A. Li J. Sui J. Carty D.J. Blank J.L. Exton J.H. Stoffel R.H. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Logothetis D.E. Hildebrandt J. Iyengar R. Science. 1995; 268: 1166-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The IC50 for QEHA effects on most processes was 50–200 μm. Cross-linking of the QEHA peptide to the β subunit is prevented by the α subunit, suggesting it binds to βγ within the α subunit-binding site (19Chen J. DeVivo M. Dingus J. Harry A. Li J. Sui J.

Another peptide derived from the COOH-terminal region of GRK2 (βARK-ct, 643–670) (21Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also binds to βγ subunits, has an IC50 of 100 μm for its effects, and has properties consistent with binding at the α subunit-binding site on βγ subunits. This notion is supported by the recently determined co-crystal structure of α subunits with GRK2 (22Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J.G. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), demonstrating binding of the region of GRK2 corresponding to this peptide to a region on βγ that overlaps with the α subunit-binding site. To confirm that these peptides block α-βγ interactions, the ability of these peptides to block binding of F-αi1 to βγ was tested by flow cytometry. Both peptides inhibited the heterotrimer formation with QEHA inhibiting by 90% and βARK-ct peptide (300 μm) by more than 65% compared with 85% by SIGK (Fig. 2A). This supports the idea that QEHA and βARK-ct peptide can inhibit α-βγ interactions probably by directly competing for α binding to βγ. To determine whether QEHA and βARK-ct peptides can stimulate release of αi1 from the heterotrimer, we measured the off rates in the presence of these peptides at concentrations that significantly inhibited α binding to βγ. Neither of these peptides caused any significant enhancement of the rate of dissociation of the α subunits from the preformed complex (Fig. 2B). There are some minor differences in the rate of dissociation for QEHA, βARK, and the intrinsic dissociation rate, but these differences were not consistently reproducible and were not significant. Thus, while being able to compete for α-βγ interactions they are unable to promote dissociation of α from βγ. These data strongly suggest that the βγ hot spot-binding peptides act through a unique mechanism that does not involve simple steric occlusion of α binding sites on βγ subunits. Effect of a GPR Consensus Motif Peptide on Association and Dissociation of Gαβγ—A class of proteins that stimulate G protein βγ subunit signaling by a nucleotide exchange-independent mechanism is the AGS proteins. AGS3 binds to α subunits, inhibits GDP release, and promotes βγ subunit signaling in yeast and is involved in establishing βγ and α subunit-dependent asymmetric cell division in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila. A 28-amino acid (GPR) motif consensus peptide derived from AGS3 and other related proteins is able to bind to α subunits and inhibit nucleotide exchange in a manner comparable with larger protein fragments of AGS3 (10Peterson Y.K.

Bernard M.L. Lanier S.M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40981-40985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Since a GPR-like peptide from RGS14 binds to α subunits near the α-βγ interface, it was proposed that these peptides enhance βγ subunit-dependent processes by competing for rebinding of α to βγ by steric occlusion of the βγ binding site on α (13Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We directly tested whether the GPR peptide could inhibit α-βγ binding and/or promote subunit dissociation. 1 μm GPR peptide was able to inhibit α binding to βγ to an extent greater than that observed with 10 μm SIGK (Fig. 3A). The IC50 for inhibition of α-βγ interactions was ∼250 nm (Fig. 3B), comparable with that observed for the ability of the peptide to inhibit GDP dissociation from α subunits. Next we tested whether 1 μm GPR peptide could cause dissociation of a preformed α-βγ complex. The GPR peptide caused a rapid dissociation of the G protein subunits, about 2-fold faster (0.95 min–1) than that observed with 25 μm SIGK (0.5 min–1) and about 13-fold higher than the intrinsic off rate of the F-αi1 subunit (Fig. 3C). The GPR peptide very potently promoted dissociation (Fig. 3D) and was about 10-fold more potent than SIGK (compare Fig. 3D with Fig. 1B). Thus, the GPR consensus peptide is a very potent and effective promoter of G protein subunit dissociation. Since they dramatically increase the dissociation rate of α from βγ, it strongly suggests that the GPR peptides act by a non-competitive mechanism. We compared the effects of the GPR peptides and βγ hot spot-binding peptides with peptides that are thought to bind at the G protein βγ subunit-α subunit interface. We show that AC2- and βARK-derived peptides are capable of blocking βγ-α subunit interactions consistent with previous data, suggesting that they bind at the α-βγ interface. These competitor peptides were unable to enhance the rate of G protein subunit dissociation, while SIGK and GPR peptides significantly enhanced subunit dissociation. The enhanced rates of G protein subunit dissociation by SIGK and GPR peptides were comparable with a known activator of G proteins, AMF. This strongly suggests that neither the SIGK peptides nor the GPR peptides are simply acting by preventing reassembly of dissociated subunits to lead to G protein activation. The GPR- and βγ-binding peptides are unique in that they induce subunit dissociation, probably through conformational alterations of α or βγ subunits respectively. In the x-ray crystallographic structural model of a GPR-like peptide from RGS 14 in a complex with αi1 (13Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), conformations of switch I and II are altered relative to heterotrimeric αiGDP βγ. These conformational differences could result in subunit dissociation via a mechanism analogous to the GTP or AlF4--dependent conformational changes in the switch regions of the α subunit that contribute to subunit dissociation (24Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). GPR proteins play important roles in regulation of asymmetric cell division in Drosophila (25Schaefer M. Petronczki M. Dorner D. Forte M. Knoblich J.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and in C. elegans (26Gotta M. Dong Y. Peterson Y.K. Lanier S.M. Ahringer J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1029-1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In particular, they appear to regulate the polarized distribution of free βγ and α subunits derived from heterotrimers required for correct orientation of mitotic spindles. In α subunit immunoprecipitates from Drosophila sensory organ precursor cells, Pins (an AGS3 homologue in Drosophila) and a peptide representing the GPR motif from Pins disrupted α-βγ interactions when added during the immunoprecipitation (25Schaefer M. Petronczki M. Dorner D. Forte M. Knoblich J.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Our results that directly measure subunit dissociation are consistent with these results. The data presented also support a model where a conformational change in βγ subunits induced by hot spot-binding peptides results in destabilization of interactions with α subunits and an increase in the k off for subunit dissociation. βγ subunits have indeed been shown to undergo conformational changes upon binding of phosducin (27Loew A. Ho Y.K. Blundell T. Bax B. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 28Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), although the functional significance of these changes are not entirely understood. A mechanism for βγ-binding peptide-mediated enhancement of subunit dissociation, whatever the details of the mechanism, is clearly very distinct from other mechanisms that exist for promoting subunit dissociation by either GPR peptides or nucleotide binding that involve conformational alterations of the switch regions of the α subunits. We thank Dr. Richard Neubig for both his advice on performing the flow cytometry experiments and for providing us with fluorescein labeled αi1."

Thus, Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation provides a mechanism to eliminate the activated pools of PTKs via protein degradation, complementing dephosphorylation and other regulatory processes.Studies with mammalian Cbl-b and Cbl-c, as well as Cae-norhabditis elegans and Drosophila Cbl homologues, have demonstrated the conservation of this mechanism (20Rao N.

Reflecting a critical role of Cbl family proteins as negative regulators of PTK signaling, the Cbl-deficient mice exhibit hypercellular lymphoid organs and increased branching morphogenesis of the mammary gland, whereas the Cbl-b-deficient mice demonstrate fulminant autoimmune disease either spontaneously or upon immunization with autoantigens (22Murphy M.A. Schnall R.G.

Huang F. Haines D. Gu H. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar).Although the functional roles of the association of Cbl with PTKs have begun to be elucidated, the role of Cbl interactions with other components of PTK signaling has remained less clear. Cbl functions as a major substrate of phosphorylation by various PTKs with which it interacts (6Lupher Jr., M.L. Rao N. Eck M.J. Band H. Immunol.

Three well characterized tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal part of Cbl mediate its association with Vav (Tyr-700), the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Tyr-731), and the adaptor proteins of the Crk family (Tyr-774) (4Miyake S.

The potential functional consequences of these associations are of great interest. Two fundamentally opposite roles, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive, have been suggested. One view is that phosphorylated Cbl serves as a scaffold to assemble signaling complexes, thus facilitating PI 3-kinase-, Vav-, or Crk-dependent cellular responses, such as cell survival and migration (20Rao N. Dodge I. Band H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 753-763PubMed Google Scholar). Given the recent appreciation of the evolutionarily conserved function of Cbl proteins as ubiquitin ligases, we and others have suggested that Cbl may also target non-kinase signaling proteins for ubiquitinylation, which in turn may either target these proteins for degradation or regulate their function independently of degradation (20Rao N. Dodge I. Band H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 753-763PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fang D. Wang H.Y. Fang N. Altman Y. Elly C. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4872-4878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Notably, Cbl-b was shown to constitutively interact with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and induce PI 3-kinase ubiquitinylation, although a change in protein levels was not observed nor did proteasome inhibitors increase the levels of ubiquitin-tagged PI 3-kinase. In conjunction with the inhibitory effect of PI 3-kinase inhibitors on the hyperactive phenotype of Cbl-b–/– T cells, these findings led the authors to suggest that Cbl-b-dependent ubiquitinylation negatively regulates the PI 3-kinase activity in a degradation-independent manner (30Fang D. Liu Y.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar); however, it remains possible that the inability of the investigators to detect an effect of Cbl on PI 3-kinase levels may simply reflect a small size of the Cbl-associated PI 3-kinase pool. Thus, there is a clear need to further elucidate the biochemical and functional consequences of the association of Cbl with non-PTKs targets. In this study, we have focused on the role of the association of Cbl with Vav.Vav is a hematopoietic-restricted member of a family (Vav, Vav2, and Vav3) of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the Rho family of small GTPases, especially Rac and Rho (31Bustelo X.R.

Vav proteins contain a calponin homology domain, an acidic region, a pleckstrin homology domain, a Dbl homology (DH) domain characteristic of all Rho family GEFs, a zinc finger domain, and two SH3 domains flanking a single SH2 region (31Bustelo X.R. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 65-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Vav-mediated Rac activation plays an important role in antigen receptor-induced cytoskeletal reorganization, and activation of stress-activated protein kinases and several important transcription factors, such as the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) and NF-κB (35Crespo P.

Among over 40 known human Rho/Rac GEFs, the Vav family is distinct in that the activity of these proteins is directly modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (35Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Vav is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to stimulation of the T and B cell antigen receptors in a Syk/ZAP70- and Src-family PTK-dependent manner (43Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M.

Although phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues regulates Vav activity, that of Tyr174 in the acidic region is quite critical, as it relieves the DH domain from the autoinhibition imposed by its intramolecular association with the N-terminal region (47Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Indeed, a Tyr → Phe mutation at Tyr-174 converts Vav into an oncogene, and enhances Vav-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization as well as JNK and NF-AT activation (48Kuhne M.R. Ku G. Weiss A. J. Biol.

Vav was shown to interact with Cbl in both thymocytes and peripheral T cells upon stimulation through the TCR (27Marengere L.E. Mirtsos C. Kozieradzki I. Veillette A. Mak T.W. Penninger J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 70-76PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide competition experiments suggested that the Cbl/Vav association was mediated by the Vav SH2 domain binding to phosphorylated Tyr-700 on Cbl (27Marengere L.E. Mirtsos C. Kozieradzki I. Veillette A. Mak T.W. Penninger J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 70-76PubMed Google Scholar).

However, studies directly establishing a role for Cbl family proteins in the regulation of Vav are lacking, and it is unknown whether the Cbl ubiquitin ligase activity is involved in such regulation. Here, we demonstrate that Cbl functions as a ubiquitin ligase toward Vav, and that this activity allows Cbl to negatively regulate Vav-mediated signaling.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells—293T human embryonic kidney epithelial cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratory, Logan, UT).

Eighteen hours after transfection, the cells (2 × 105 cells/ well) were seeded in quadruplicate for each stimulation condition, and stimulated for 6–8 h at 37 °C with media alone, 0.25 μg/ml anti-CD3 mAb, or 0.25 μg/ml each of anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 mAb. Luciferase assays were performed on equal aliquots of cell lysates according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). Where indicated, the cells were cotransfected with a Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (pRL-TK; Promega). Firefly (NF-AT) and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega), and NF-AT luciferase activity in each sample was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity to control for any variability in the transfection efficiency; the data are presented as mean ± standard deviation of quadruplicate samples.

https://openalex.org/W1992095999,"The 96-residue human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) accessory protein Vpr serves manifold functions in the retroviral life cycle including augmentation of viral replication in non-dividing host cells, induction of G2 cell cycle arrest, and modulation of HIV-induced apoptosis. Using a combination of dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism, and NMR spectroscopy the N terminus of Vpr is shown to be a unique domain of the molecule that behaves differently from the C-terminal domain in terms of self-association and secondary structure folding. Interestingly, the four highly conserved proline residues in the N terminus are predicted to have a high propensity for cis/trans isomerism. Thus the high resolution structure and folding of a synthetic N-terminal peptide (Vpr1–40) and smaller fragments thereof have been investigated. 1H NMR data indicate Vpr1–40 possesses helical structure between residues 17–32, and for the first time, this helix, which is bound by proline residues, was observed even in aqueous solution devoid of any detergent supplements. In addition, NMR data revealed that all of the proline residues undergo a cis/ trans isomerism to such an extent that ∼40% of all Vpr molecules possess at least one proline in a cis conformation. This phenomenon of cis/trans isomerism, which is unprecedented for HIV-1 Vpr, not only provides an explanation for the molecular heterogeneity observed in the full-length molecule but also indicates that in vivo the folding and function of Vpr should depend on a cis/trans-proline isomerase activity, particularly as two of the proline residues in positions 14 and 35 show considerable amounts of cis isomers. This prediction correlates well with our recent observation (Zander, K., Sherman, M. P., Tessmer, U., Bruns, K., Wray, V., Prechtel, A. T., Schubert, E., Henklein, P., Luban, J., Neidleman, J., Greene, W. C., and Schubert, U. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 43170–43181) of a functional interaction between the major cellular isomerase cyclophilin A and Vpr, both of which are incorporated into HIV-1 virions."

https://openalex.org/W1999679043,"B16 melanoma (B16M) cells with high GSH content show high metastatic activity. However, the molecular mechanisms linking GSH to metastatic cell survival are unclear. The possible relationship between GSH and the ability of Bcl-2 to prevent cell death was studied in B16M cells with high (F10) and low (F1) metastatic potential. Analysis of a Bcl-2 family of genes revealed that B16M-F10 cells, as compared with B16M-F1 cells, overexpressed preferentially Bcl-2 (approximately 5.7-fold). Hepatic sinusoidal endothelium-induced B16M-F10 cytotoxicity in vitro increased from approximately 19% (controls) to approximately 97% in GSH-depleted B16M-F10 cells treated with an antisense Bcl-2 oligodeoxynucleotide (Bcl-2-AS). l-Buthionine (S,R)-sulfoximine-induced GSH depletion or Bcl-2-AS decreased the metastatic growth of B16M-F10 cells in the liver. However, the combination of l-buthionine (S,R)-sulfoximine and Bcl-2-AS abolished metastatic invasion. Bcl-2-overexpressing B16M-F1/Tet-Bcl-2 and B16M-F10/Tet-Bcl-2 cells, as compared with controls, showed an increase in GSH content, no change in the rate of GSH synthesis, and a decrease in GSH efflux. Thus, Bcl-2 overexpression may increase metastatic cell resistance against oxidative/nitrosative stress by inhibiting release of GSH. In addition, Bcl-2 availability regulates the mitochondrial GSH (mtGSH)-dependent opening of the permeability transition pore complex. Death in B16M-F10 cells was sharply activated at mtGSH levels below 30% of controls values. However, this critical threshold increased to approximately 60% of control values in Bcl-2-AS-treated B16M-F10 cells. GSH ester-induced replenishment of mtGSH levels (even under conditions of cytosolic GSH depletion) prevented cell death. Our results indicate that survival of B16M cells with high metastatic potential can be challenged by inhibiting their GSH and Bcl-2 synthesis."

Zagórowska I. Adamiak R.W. Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. Symp. Ser. 1999; 2: 191-196Google Scholar, 35Nifosi R. Reyes C.M. Kollman P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4944-4955Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). From these studies it is apparent that the conformation of the bulge differs significantly in the absence and presence of the Tat protein. The bulge residues are partially stacked in the free TAR RNA. Upon binding of Tat, the bulge is extruded from the TAR helix and a base triple is formed that involves the first bulge residue U23 and the A27-U38 base pair. The binding of Tat to TAR thus coincides with a dramatic change in the tertiary structure of TAR, which may occur by an induced fit or conformational capture mechanism (36Leulliot N. Varani G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about the structural properties of the six-nucleotide apical loop of the TAR hairpin. NMR studies demonstrated considerable conformational flexibility in the loop with a tendency to form a compact loop structure (30Aboul-ela F. Karn J. Varani G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 313-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 37Colvin R.A. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 930-935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Michnicka M.J. Harper J.W. King G.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It appears that the most structured regions are at either end of the loop, consistent with stacking of loop residues on the stem-closing base pair (30Aboul-ela F. Karn J. Varani G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 313-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 37Colvin R.A. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 930-935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Jaeger J.A. Tinoco Jr., I.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and relaxation experiments suggested that A35 has an unusual local environment and is extruded from the apical loop (40King G.C. Harper J.W. Xi Z. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 436-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A few investigators have proposed distinct structural features of the apical TAR loop. The possibility of a protonated non-canonical C30-A35H+ base pair, yielding a tetraloop structure for TAR has been suggested (39Jaeger J.A. Tinoco Jr., I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12522-12530Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a cross-loop base pair involving residue C30 and the penultimate loop residue G34 has been proposed (41Critchley A.D. Haneef I. Cousens D.J. Stockley P.G. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This interaction has been observed transiently in molecular dynamics simulations (34Kulinski T. Bielecki L. Olejniczak M. Zagórowska I. Adamiak R.W. Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. Symp. Ser. 1999; 2: 191-196Google Scholar, 35Nifosi R. Reyes C.M. Kollman P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4944-4955Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and it was recently suggested that the C30-G34 cross-loop base pair is required for binding of cyclin T1 (42Richter S. Cao H. Rana T.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6391-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this study, we specifically address the structure of the TAR loop and its involvement in the HIV-1 LTR promoter activity. We present evidence that the TAR apical loop can indeed form the C30-G34 base pair. Biochemical studies and molecular dynamics with a model TAR hairpin, and modified analogues thereof, indicate that residue G34 is oriented inside the loop. G34 can form relatively stable hydrogen bonds with C30. The C30-G34 base pair stacks on the C29-G36 closing base pair of the stem. Subsequent analysis of mutant TAR constructs in LTR-luciferase assays confirmed the importance of the cross-loop base pair in Tat-mediated transcriptional activation. Oligoribonucleotide Synthesis—The synthesis of 29-mer HIV-1 TAR RNA and its 2-aminopurine riboside modified analogues AP34 and AP35 was performed using solid-support aided phoshoramidite chemistry and applying the 2′-O-tBDMSi protection (43Usman N. Ogilvie K.K. Jiang M.Y. Cedergren R.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 7845-7854Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar). After 1 μmol of scale synthesis and deprotection with fluoride ion, the RNA was purified by preparative 19% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, followed by electroelution with a Biotrap BT 1000 and desalting on NAP columns. The sequence of the oligomers was confirmed by RNA sequencing with ribonuclease T1. UV Melting and Thermodynamics—UV melting of the chemically synthesized oligomers was measured on a temperature controlled Beckman DU70 spectrophotometer in the temperature range from 10 to 98 °C (heating rate of 1.0 °C min-1, sampling at each 0.3 °C). The buffer for thermodynamic studies was 1 m NaCl, 10 mm phosphate (pH 7.0). The RNA concentrations, varied over 50-fold range, were calculated from the absorbance at 260 nm measured at 80 °C using single-strand extinction coefficients approximated by a nearest-neighbor model. Unimolecular hairpin formation was checked by oligomer concentration dependence of the UV melting profiles. Prior to the measurement, the RNA was renatured by incubation at 85 °C for 3 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Absorbance versus temperature profiles were fit to two-state transition model with sloping baselines by using the nonlinear least-squares program MeltWin. The experiments were repeated 3-5 times. Thermal denaturation of in vitro synthesized 1/466 HIV-1 RNA was measured on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 2 spectrophotometer at a heating rate of 0.5 °C min-1 with sampling at each 0.1 °C. Samples contained ∼3.0 μg of RNA dissolved in 140 μl of 50 mm sodium Cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2). Prior to the measurement, the RNA was renatured by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Electrophoretic analysis of the samples prior to the analysis confirmed the monomeric state of the RNA. No significant degradation of the transcripts was apparent after the measurement as judged by analysis of the RNA on a sequencing gel. Pb 2+ -induced RNA Phosphodiester Bond Cleavage—The oligoribonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase, gel purified and quantitated on a Beckmann LS5000TA scintillation counter. The RNA was refolded by heating at 80 °C for 30 s, followed by slow cooling to room temperature in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 40 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 8 μm carrier tRNA. Freshly prepared Pb(OAc)2 was added to final concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2 mm. This reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. At least three independent experiments were performed with each oligomer. RNA cleavage ladders were generated by boiling the RNA in formamide for 40 min. G-specific sequencing ladders were generated by incubation with 0.2 units/μl RNase T1 in 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 4.5) and 7 m urea for 10 min at 55 °C. All reactions were quenched by the addition of the equal volume of gel loading buffer (8 m urea, 20 mm EDTA, tracking dyes) and transferred to dry ice. Reaction products were separated by 19% PAGE (8 m urea). Cleavages were visualized and quantitatively analyzed using a Typhoon 8600 apparatus with ImageQuant software. The images were not edited and linear relationship between signal and image intensity was retained. Modeling and Molecular Dynamics Simulations—The 29-mer RNA models of the wild-type sequence and mutants AP34 and AP35 were built using the Amber 4.1 (44Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 74: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2686) Google Scholar) suite of programs and the initial coordinates according to model #17 of TAR from the 1ANR PDB file (30Aboul-ela F. Karn J. Varani G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 313-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The force field parameters for 2-aminopurine riboside were developed using the Gaussian 94 (45Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Gill P.M.W. Johnson B.G. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Raghavachari K. Al-Laham M.A. Zakrzewski V.G. Ortiz J.V. Foresman J.B. Cioslowski J. Stefanov B.B. Nanayakkara A. Challacombe M.

Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA1996Google Scholar) and Resp (46Cieplak P. Cornell W.D. Bayly C. Kollman P.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1995; 16: 1357-1377Crossref Scopus (872) Google Scholar) programs. Na+ counterions were added and solvated in a rectangular periodic boundary conditions box, an 8.5 Å thick water layer was maintained in all dimensions around the RNA molecules. The simulations were carried out with the Sander module using the Amber force field (44Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 74: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2686) Google Scholar) on a Cray J916 computer. The protocol for the simulations consisted of an equilibration procedure followed by up to 1.6 ns of unrestrained molecular dynamics in 300 K with the long-range electrostatic interactions treated using the particle-mesh Ewald summation method (PME) (47York D.M. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 99: 8345-8348Crossref Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Frames were collected every 1 ps. Conformational analysis was based on the last 50 non-minimized frames. Models of the 14-mer TAR RNA mini-hairpin (fragment 26-39) were built using the INSIGHTII program. Coordinates for the backbone of an initial structure were taken from the NMR structure of the adenosine-rich hexaloop RNA hairpin (PDB code 1bvj) (48Puglisi E.V. Puglisi J.D. Nat. Med. 1998; 5: 1033-1036Google Scholar). The HIV-1 TAR sequence was modeled onto the structure by appropriate base substitutions, while keeping the original orientation of the replaced bases. The structure was subsequently minimized and remodeled. The resulting models of the hairpin were solvated in a water box containing TIP3P water. 13 Na+ ions were added to neutralize system. The whole system was first minimized with harmonic constraints applied to the RNA and finally, without any constraints. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the CHARMM version 27 program, and force field parameters Charmm27 (49Foloppe N. MacKerell A.D. J. Comp. Chem. 2000; 21: 86-104Crossref Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) on a Pentium III multiprocessor cluster. MD simulations of each model started with heating the whole system from 50 to 300 K, 320 K, or 340 K in 6 ps followed by 4 ps of equilibration. MD simulations where run in the NVE ensemble, using periodic boundary condition, time step 0.002 ps and the SHAKE algorithm. Frames were collected every 2 ps. The trajectories collected at given temperatures were searched for the regions showing low RMSD, displaying locally stable conformations of the apical loop structure. In Vitro Transcription—PCR products to be used as DNA templates for in vitro transcription were generated as described previously (50Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To produce transcript in which the sequence of the TAR loop (GGG, nt 32-34) was changed to AAA, the PCR was performed with an antisense primer termed TAR T7 AAA: (5′-AAT TCT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG GTC TCT CTG GTT AGA CCA GAT TTG AGC CUA AAA GCT CTC TGG-3′). The 466-nt HIV-1 transcripts were synthesized from PCR templates with the Ambion T7 megashortscript transcription kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was excised from a 4% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, using UV shadowing for visualization. The RNA was eluted from the gel slice by overnight incubation in 1× Tris/borate EDTA buffer at 4 °C and continuous shaking. After precipitation and ethanol washing the RNA was dissolved in demineralized water, heated at 80 °C and cooled slowly to room temperature. Aliquots were stored at -20 °C. RNA Structure Probing—For chemical structure probing, 2 μg of in vitro synthesized RNA corresponding to the first 80 nucleotides of HIV-1 transcripts (1-80) was dissolved in water and heated to 80 °C. Tubes were then placed in a 60 °C water bath, salt was added and the solution was allowed to slowly cool to 37 °C. Final solutions contained 50 mm Na Cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) and 1.0 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 100 μl. A volume of 1.0 μl of DMS or kethoxal was added and allowed to react for 5 and 15 min, respectively. Reactions were stopped by adding 5 μl of 10 μg/μl total Escherichia coli tRNA and subsequent precipitation with ammonium acetate. The precipitated RNA was dissolved in 10 μl of water, of which 2 μl was used for primer extension reactions. The primer used anneals to nucleotides 61-80 of the transcript, primer R80/61. Reverse transcription with the AMV reverse transcriptase was performed as described previously (50Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Samples were precipitated and loaded on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The intensity of reverse transcriptase stops caused by base modification was analyzed on a Storm 860 phosphorimager. Plasmid Constructs—The pBlue3′LTR-luc plasmid contains an XhoI-HindIII fragment from the HIV-1 LAI proviral DNA, encoding the complete U3 region, the transcription start site (+1) and R sequences up to position +82, coupled to the Firefly luciferase reporter gene (51Jeeninga R.E. Hoogenkamp M. Armand-Ugon M. de Baar M. Verhoef K. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3740-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). For mutation of the TAR hairpin, a PCR was performed with the primer LAI5′X (5′-CAT TCT AGA TGG AAG GGC TAA TTC ACT CCC-3′) and one of the following a mutagenic primers (substituted nucleotides underlined): TAR(U30G34): 5′-AGG CTT AAG CAG TGG GTT CCC TAG TTA GCC AGA GAG CTC CCA AGC TCA A-3′; TAR(C30A34) 5′-GAG GCT TAA GCA GTG GGT TCC CTA GTT AGC CAG AGA GCT TCC AGG-3′; TAR(U30A34) 5′-GAG GCT TAA GCA GTG GGT TCC CTA GTT AGC CAG AGA GCT TCC AAG CTC AA-3′; TAR(G30G34): 5′-AGG CTT AAG CAG TGG GTT CCC TAG TTA GCC AGA GAG CTC CCA CGC TCA A-3′; TAR(C30C34) 5′-GAG GCT TAA GCA GTG GGT TCC CTA GTT AGC CAG AGA GCT GCC AGG-3′; TAR(G30C34) 5′-GAG GCT TAA GCA GTG GGT TCC CTA GTT AGC CAG AGA GCT GCC ACG CTC AA-3′. The PCR fragments were digested with BfrI and DraIII and cloned in the corresponding sites of pBlue3′LTR-luc. All mutations were verified by sequence analysis. The pRL-CMV plasmid contains the Renilla luciferase reporter gene and the CMV promoter elements and is used as an internal control reporter plasmid in transfection assays. pcDNA3-Tat expresses the HIV-1 LAI Tat gene under control of the CMV promoter (52Verhoef K. Koper M. Berkhout B. Virology. 1997; 237: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cells and Transfection—Transfection of C33A was performed the calcium phosphate method as previously described (53Das A.T. Klaver B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 81-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SupT1 T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected by electroporation. 5 × 106 cells were washed in RPMI 1640 with 20% fetal calf serum, mixed with DNA in 0.4-cm cuvettes and electroporated at 250 volts and 960 μF, and then resuspended in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum. The transcriptional activity of the wild-type and TAR-mutated HIV-1 LTRs was determined by transfection of SupT1 T cells with 5 μg of wild-type or TAR mutated pBlue3′LTR-luc, 0.5 μg of pRL-CMV, with or without 0.5 μg of pcDNA3-Tat. At 2 days after transfection, cells were isolated by centrifugation at 260 g for 10 min. The Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system was used to determine the firefly and Renilla luciferase levels. Comparative Sequence Analysis—Sequences of different HIV-1 isolates were obtained from the HIV data base at Los Alamos (web.lanl.gov/). Only isolates with a complete TAR sequence were considered in the analysis, yielding a total of 654 sequences from most of the prevailing HIV-1 subtypes. Thermal Denaturation of HIV-1 RNA with a Mutated TAR Loop—To test if the TAR loop is structured, we performed a UV-melting experiment with transcripts corresponding to the 5′-terminal 466 nucleotides of the wild-type HIV-1 RNA and a mutant in which the apical loop residues 32-34 were changed from GGG to AAA (Fig. 1). Three discrete transitions are apparent for both transcripts, which we termed T m1, T m2, and T m3. The high-temperature transition T m3 has previously been shown to correspond to the TAR hairpin, and the intense T m2 transition reflects melting of the extended LDI stem in the downstream leader domain (50Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). T m1 is a rather diffuse transition that occurs at low temperature, which may suggest melting of a tertiary structure motif in the HIV-1 RNA. The melting temperatures of T m1 and T m2 are similar for the wild-type RNA and the AAA mutant, but we consistently observed a difference of 1.6 °C for the TAR melting transition T m3. This difference is significantly higher than the experimental variation that we measured for duplicate samples (<0.5 °C). Thus, the sequence change in the loop has destabilized the TAR hairpin, which indicates that the loop is structured and contributes to the stability of the TAR hairpin. Electrophoretic and Thermodynamic Properties of 2-Amino-purine-substituted TAR Hairpins—To study the structure of the TAR loop in more detail, we synthesized 29-mer TAR hairpins with the wild-type sequence and 2-aminopurine substitutions at position 34 or 35 (Fig. 2A). When these oligoribonucleotides were checked for their purity in denaturing PAGE, all three fragments demonstrated the same electrophoretic mobility (results not shown). However, under non-denaturing PAGE conditions, the modified hairpin AP34 exhibits significantly increased mobility compared with the wild-type hairpin (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the AP35 hairpin shows practically the same mobility as the wild-type hairpin. This effect was independent of different incubation procedures used for refolding of the RNA prior to non-denaturing PAGE (results not shown). Thus, the different electrophoretic mobility of hairpin AP34 indicates a substantial change in the structural properties of its apical loop in comparison with the wild-type and AP35 hairpins. Next, we performed melting experiments with the 29-mer hairpins and derived the thermodynamic parameters by numerical analysis (Table I). Each hairpin melts in a single transition and melting temperatures (T m) were independent on the RNA concentration in the range from 0.3 to 15 μm, which indicates the absence of dimeric or higher order RNA complexes. Both AP34 and AP35 are less stable than the wild-type TAR hairpin, as reflected in a decrease of the melting temperatures. The difference of melting temperature T m between the wild-type TAR and AP35 is small (0.6 °C), but the ΔG 037 of AP35 is ∼0.81 kcal/mol higher than that of the wild-type RNA. Thermodynamic parameters of AP34 are more evidently different. The T m of AP34 is 3.2 °C lower and ΔG 037 is 1.0 kcal/mol higher than that of wild-type TAR. Thus, the replacement of G34 by a AP leads to a significant destabilization of TAR hairpin that is more severe than the same substitution at position 35. These results indicate that residue G34 is more important than A35 in maintaining a structured apical loop.Table IThermodynamic parameters for the wild-type, AP34, and AP35 TAR hairpinsTAR RNAΔG 037ΔHΔSTmΔΔG 037ΔΔHΔΔSkcal/molkcal/molcal/K mol°Ckcal/molkcal/molcal/K molwt−8.06 ± 0.09−70.7 ± 2.1−201.8 ± 4.076.5 ± 0.3ΔP34−7.05 ± 0.11−67.2 ± 1.9−194.0 ± 5.173.3 ± 0.311.01+3.5+7.8ΔP35−7.25 ± 0.13−65.1 ± 1.5−186.5 ± 4.675.9 ± 0.4+0.81+5.6+15.3 Open table in a new tab Lead-induced Cleavage of 2-Aminopurine-substituted TAR Hairpins—Metal ion promoted RNA cleavage can be used to map single stranded regions and metal coordination sites in an RNA structure (54Ciesiolka J.

https://openalex.org/W2043599946,"Beta-catenin is an executor of Wnt signaling and it can control cell fate and specification. Deletion of exon 3 from the endogenous beta-catenin gene in differentiating mammary alveolar epithelium of the mouse results in the generation of an activated protein that lacks amino acids 5-80. This is accompanied by a loss of mammary epithelial differentiation and a transdifferentiation process to squamous metaplasias. To further understand the molecular process of transdifferentiation, the expression of genes in mammary tissue was profiled in the absence and presence of activated of beta-catenin. Microarrays were generated that carry about 8500 cDNA clones with approximately 6000 obtained from mammary tissue. Mutant tissues, which had undergone either partial (TD1) or complete (TD2) squamous transdifferentiation, were compared with wild-type mammary tissue. Four groups of genes were identified. Group 1 contained genes whose expression was induced in both mutant tissues. Groups 2 and 3 contained genes that were active preferentially in TD2 and TD1, respectively. Group 4 contained genes suppressed in both samples. Using this approach, known and unknown genes activated in the transdifferentiation process were identified. A new 20 kDa protein (PANE1) induced upon transdifferentiation was nuclear in nonconfluent cells and cytoplasmic in confluent or dividing cells. Lastly, stabilization of beta-catenin resulted in the retention of differentiated epithelium upon involution and altered activities of several proteases in transdifferentiated mammary epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2025864852,"Transactivating proteins associated with complex onco-retroviruses including human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1) and bovine leukemia virus (BLV) mediate transformation using poorly understood mechanisms. To gain insight into the processes that govern tumor onset and progression, we have examined the impact of BLV-Tax expression on ovine B-cells, the targets of BLV in experimentally infected sheep, using B-cell clones that are dependent on CD154 and gammac-common cytokines. Tax was capable of mediating progression of B-cells from cytokine dependence to cytokine independence, indicating that the transactivator can over-ride signaling pathways typically controlled by cytokine receptor activation in B-cells. When examined in the presence of both CD154 and interleukin-4, Tax had a clear supportive role on B-cell growth, with an impact on B-cell proliferation, cell cycle phase distribution, and survival. Apoptotic B-cell death mediated by growth factor withdrawal, physical insult, and NF-kappaB inhibition was dramatically reduced in the presence of Tax. Furthermore, the expression of Tax was associated with higher Bcl-2 protein levels, providing rationale for the rescue signals mediated by the transactivator. Finally, Tax expression in B-cells led to a dramatic increase of nuclear RelB/p50 and p50/p50 NF-kappaB dimers, indicating that cellular signaling through NF-kappaB is a major contributory mechanism in the disruption of B-cell homeostasis. Although Tax is involved in aspects of pathogenesis that are unique to complex retroviruses, the viral strategies associated with this transactivating oncoprotein may have wide-ranging effects that are relevant to other B-cell malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2023206012,"The N-terminal proline-rich domain of human p53 has been shown to be important for the induction of apoptosis. However, the corresponding region in mouse and other species is not highly conserved and has been less well studied. In this paper, we have characterized mutants with deletions in this region of mouse p53. Our results demonstrate that deletions in the proline-rich domain have varying effects on function ranging from no effect to severe impairment of cell death activity, depending on precisely which residues are deleted. We also show that the mutants differ in their ability to transactivate different p53 target promoters. Although we have been able to obtain mutants selectively impaired for apoptosis, our data are not generally consistent with this region being a functional domain. The data are more consistent with the interpretation that the region influences function by altering local protein structure which may affect promoter discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W2039734446,"We previously reported the identification of a novel zinc-finger gene, designated ZSG, fused to Ewing sarcoma gene (EWS) by a submicroscopic paracentric inversion of 22q12 in a small round cell sarcoma presenting a translocation t(1;22)(p34;q12). We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of the breakpoint in 1p34, which encompasses the gene coding for mitochondrial Hinge protein ubiquinol-cytochrome C reductase hinge gene (UQCRH). All the three breakpoints, two on 22q12 and one in 1p34, interrupt different genes: EWS, ZSG and UQCRH. We determined the genomic structure of UQCRH, characterized its splicing variants and identified a transcribed processed pseudogene. The analysis of UQCRH expression in normal tissues and cancer cell lines revealed absent expression of UQCRH in two ovarian and one breast cancer cell lines and reduced expression in a further breast carcinoma cell line. CpG island methylation upstream exon 1 was detected in all the three cell lines with absent expression. Moreover, treatment with demethylating agent 5-azacytidine restored UQCRH expression in OAW42 ovarian cancer cells. These data provide preliminary evidence of the inactivation of UQCRH gene in cancer either by structural rearrangements or epigenetic mechanisms."

Therefore, E2 is essential for the viral life cycle. The E2 protein interacts with several proteins involved in the cellular response to DNA damage including p53, TopBP1, and PARP. We therefore set out to establish whether DNA-damaging agents can regulate E2 activity. Here we show that UVB irradiation downregulates transcriptional activity of both HPV16 and HPV8 E2, while hydroxyurea and etoposide do not. This downregulation of E2 activity is independent of p53 function as it occurs in p53 wild type and null cell types as well as in the presence of functional HPV16 E6 that degrades p53. Using stable cell lines expressing E2 we show that this downregulation of E2 function by UVB is due to a reduction of the E2 protein half-life. The identification of the pathway(s) through which UVB downregulates E2 transcriptional activity and protein levels will present a novel target for the treatment of HPV-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2010606793,"Helicases are among the first enzymes to encounter DNA damage during DNA processing within the cell and thus are likely to be targets for the adverse effects of DNA lesions induced by environmental chemicals. Here we examined the effect of cis- and trans-opened 3,4-diol 1,2-epoxide (DE) DNA adducts of benzo[c]phenanthrene (BcPh) at N 6 of adenine on helicase activity. These adducts are derived from the highly tumorigenic (–)-(1R,2S,3S,4R)-DE as well as its less carcinogenic (+)-(1S,2R,3R,4S)-DE enantiomer in both of which the benzylic 4-hydroxyl group and epoxide oxygen are trans. The hydrocarbon portions of these adducts intercalate into DNA on the 3′ or the 5′ side of the adducted deoxyadenosine for the 1S- and 1R-adducts, respectively. These adducts inhibited the human Werner (WRN) syndrome helicase activity in a strand-specific and stereospecific manner. In the strand along which WRN translocates, cis-opened adducts were significantly more effective inhibitors than trans-opened isomers, indicating that WRN unwinding is sensitive to adduct stereochemistry. WRN helicase activity was also inhibited but to a lesser extent by cis-opened BcPh DE adducts in the displaced strand independent of their direction of intercalation, whereas inhibition by the trans-opened stereoisomers in the displaced strand depended on their orientation, such that only adducts oriented toward the advancing helicase inhibited WRN activity. A BcPh DE adduct positioned in the helicase-translocating strand did not sequester WRN, nor affect the rate of ATP hydrolysis relative to an unadducted control. Although the Bloom (BLM) syndrome helicase was also inhibited by a cis-opened adduct in a strand-specific manner, this helicase was not as severely affected as WRN. Because BcPh DEs form substantial amounts of deoxyadenosine adducts at dA, their adverse effects on helicases could contribute to genetic damage and cell transformation induced by these DEs. Thus, the unwinding activity of RecQ helicases is sensitive to the strand, orientation, and stereochemistry of intercalated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adducts.

Helicases are enzymes that disrupt complementary strands of duplex DNA in a reaction dependent on nucleoside-5′-triphosphate hydrolysis (1Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev.

Evidence suggests that helicases play important roles in DNA metabolism, and a growing number of helicases have been linked to human disease (4Mohaghegh P. Hickson I.D. Hum. Mol.

Pathways of DNA replication, recombination, and repair are affected by DNA lesions, and the effects of helicases on such pathways are probably modulated by their interactions with chemically modified DNA. Although the mechanism for DNA unwinding has been studied for several helicases (reviewed in Refs. 1Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 2Marians K.J. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: R227-R235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 3Patel S.S.

Hickson I.D. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Only limited information is available pertaining to the mechanism of DNA unwinding by RecQ helicases, and no crystallographic data are currently available. Biochemical studies of the prototype member, Escherichia coli RecQ helicase, indicate that the enzyme utilizes multiple interacting ATP-binding sites to unwind double-stranded DNA (7Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 232-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The human WRN gene product, which is defective in the premature aging disorder Werner syndrome, encodes a 1,432 amino acid protein with the seven conserved motifs found in the RecQ family of Super-family 2 DNA helicases (8Yu C.E.

Thus, WRN is thought to translocate 3′–5′ along the bound single-stranded DNA residing between the duplex portions of a helicase directionality substrate. However, unidirectional translocation of WRN on a DNA lattice remains to be demonstrated. Although the DNA substrate specificity of WRN (11Brosh Jr., R.M. Waheed J. Sommers J.A. J. Biol.

Our recent work demonstrated that WRN helicase is able to unwind a synthetic replication fork in the direction of the fork (11Brosh Jr., R.M. Waheed J. Sommers J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23236-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), a biochemical activity that may be important for the maintenance of fork progression. WRN was recently shown to interact functionally with DNA polymerase δ by stimulating the enzymatic rate of nucleotide incorporation (21Kamath-Loeb A.S. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4603-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown that WRN facilitates polymerase δ synthesis through hairpin and tetraplex structures that impede the polymerase, suggesting that WRN may remove secondary structure at a stalled replication fork to allow polymerase δ synthesis to proceed (22Kamath-Loeb A.S.

The results to be reported here suggest that WRN may not function properly to ensure replication fork progression if the fork is blocked by a covalent DNA adduct, even though WRN may disrupt other DNA structures such as tetraplexes (13Mohaghegh P.

In this study, we examined the effects of site-specific benzo[c]phenanthrene (BcPh) DE adducts at N 6 of deoxyadenosine (Scheme I) positioned centrally in the double-stranded region of a forked DNA duplex substrate on the unwinding activity catalyzed by WRN helicase. These adducts are derived by both cis- and trans-opening of the (–)-(1R,2S,3S,4R)- and (+)-(1S,2R,3R,4S)-enantiomers of the DE in which the benzylic 4-hydroxyl group and epoxide oxygen are trans. The DEs are examples of mutagenic and carcinogenic bay-region diol epoxide metabolites that are formed from PAH by the combined action of cytochrome P-450 and epoxide hydrolase (27Jerina D.M.

Notably, human liver microsomes metabolize BcPh via the carcinogenic diol epoxide pathway to a greater extent than do microsomes from rat liver (36Baum M. Amin S. Guengerich F.P. Hecht S.S. Kohl W. Eisenbrand G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The metabolically derived BcPh DEs react extensively with dA residues in DNA in vitro (37Dipple A.

In particular the (–)-(1R,2S,3S,4R)-BcPh DE is one of the most tumorigenic PAH DEs identified to date (40Levin W. Chang R.L. Wood A.W. Thakker D.R. Yagi H. Jerina D.M. Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2257-2261PubMed Google Scholar).A particularly useful feature of the PAH DEs is the variety of structural motifs exhibited by the different DE adducts within duplex DNA. These structural motifs have been well characterized by NMR studies. The aromatic portions of the 1R and 1S trans-opened BcPh DE N 6-dA adducts used in this study (see Fig. 1) intercalate between adjacent base pairs in duplex DNA (41Cosman M. Fiala R. Hingerty B.E.

Local stretching of the double helix accommodates the intercalated aromatic rings, and the adducted adenine retains Watson-Crick base pairing to its complement within the helix despite some buckling and propeller twisting of the adducted base pair. The non-aromatic benzo-rings are situated in the major groove, and the intercalated aromatic portion projects toward but not into the minor groove. These trans-opened BcPh DE-dA adducts are oriented such that the aromatic moiety of the 1R dA adduct intercalates on the 5′ side of the adducted adenine base, whereas the aromatic moiety of the 1S dA adduct intercalates on the 3′ side (41Cosman M. Fiala R. Hingerty B.E. Laryea A. Lee H. Harvey R.G. Amin S. Geacintov N.E. Broyde S. Patel D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12488-12497Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 42Cosman M. Laryea A.

Although the solution structures of cis-opened BcPh DE-dA adducts in DNA have not been determined by NMR, the two cis-adducts in the present study are likely to exhibit the same dependence of the direction of intercalation on their configuration at C-1 as their trans-analogs.Fig. 1Inhibition of WRN helicase activity by a single BcPh DE adduct positioned in the strand on which WRN translocates is dependent on the stereochemistry of the adduct.

The cis-S BcPh DE-dA adduct in the strand on which WRN is presumed to translocate was a potent inhibitor of unwinding activity, but a forked duplex containing this adduct did not sequester WRN to any greater extent than an unmodified control. The trans-S adduct was not as effective as the cis-S isomer in inhibiting translocation. Inhibition of unwinding activity is also sensitive to the orientation of the adduct (toward or away from the advancing helicase) in the displaced strand of the duplex region, which is opposite to the strand on which the helicase translocates.MATERIALS AND METHODSProteins—Recombinant hexahistidine-tagged WRN protein (wild-type, WRN-E84A) was overexpressed using a baculovirus/Sf9 insect system and purified as described previously (43Orren D.K.

Helicase reactions were initiated by the addition of the respective helicase and then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were quenched with 10 μl of loading buffer (50 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol) containing a 10-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide with the same sequence as the labeled strand. The products of the helicase reactions were resolved on nondenaturing 12% (19:1 acrylamide: bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled DNA species in polyacrylamide gels were visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantitated using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The percent helicase substrate unwound was calculated by the formula: percent unwinding = 100 × (P/(S + P)), where P is the product and S is the residual substrate. The values of P and S have been corrected after subtracting background values in controls containing no enzyme and heat-denatured substrate, respectively. Helicase data represent the mean of at least three independent experiments with mean ± S.D. shown by error bars.For helicase sequestration studies, WRN (3.6 nm, 72 fmol) was preincubated with the indicated amounts (0–500 fmol) of “unlabeled” single-stranded DNA (oligonucleotides unadducted A or adducted E) or “unlabeled” forked-duplex DNA molecules (substrates 1-unadducted or 5-cis-S) in standard helicase reaction buffer (described above) containing 2 mm ATP for 3 min at 24 °C. 10 fmol of radiolabeled forked-duplex molecule (11-tracker) was subsequently added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 7 min at 37 °C. Reactions were then quenched and resolved on native polyacrylamide gels as described above. Typically, 75–90% of the tracker-11 helicase substrate was unwound in reactions lacking the competitor DNA molecule. Displacement (% Control) is expressed relative to the control reactions lacking the competitor DNA.ATPase Assays—ATPase assay reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 5% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mm MgCl2, the indicated duplex DNA effector concentration, 0.8 mm [3H]ATP, and 55 nm WRN. Reactions were initiated by the addition of WRN and incubated at 37 °C. Samples (5 μl) were removed at 2-min intervals and evaluated by thin layer chromatography as described previously (50Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). <20% of the substrate ATP was consumed in the reaction over the entire time course (10 min) of the experiments. K eff values (Table III) were determined using linear regression analysis from double reciprocal plots of ATP hydrolysis initial rate versus forked-duplex DNA effector concentration (Fig. 4).Table IIIHydrolysis of ATP by WRN in presence of forked-duplex DNA effectorsTable IIIHydrolysis of ATP by WRN in presence of forked-duplex DNA effectorsFig. 4WRN requires similar concentrations of BcPh DE-modified and unmodified forked duplex for half-maximal ATP hydrolysis activity. DNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis reactions were as described under “Materials and Methods” using 55 nm WRN, 0.8 mm [3H]ATP, and the indicated concentration of 1-unadducted (•)or5-cis-S (○) forked duplex as the DNA effector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSTo understand better the effects of DNA structural elements on WRN-unwinding activity, we investigated how the helicase is affected by a series of structurally related single covalent DNA adducts. Specifically, the helicase substrates are forked DNA duplexes with a covalently bonded site-specific BcPh DE adduct in one of the two DNA strands (Table I) and positioned centrally in the 20-mer duplex region (Table II). For the purposes of this study, the stereochemistry and position of the adduct within the DNA duplex were varied. In the first class of substrates (Table II, substrates 1–5 with a 5-nucleotide 3′-unduplexed tail), the adduct is positioned within the shorter 25-mer strand on which WRN is presumed to 3′–5′ translocate. The second class of substrates (Table II, substrates 6–10 with a 25-nucleotide 3′-unduplexed tail) contains the same adducts as the first class, but the adduct is on the 25-mer strand opposite to the 45-mer strand on which WRN translocates. Because the forked-duplex substrates used in this study contain a relatively short duplex tract (20 bp), we were able to study WRN helicase activity by measuring the release of the labeled intact 45-mer in the absence of an auxiliary factor such as replication protein A. Our choice of forked-duplex DNA substrates harboring a site-specific BcPh DE adduct enabled us to assess the effects of adduct stereochemistry, orientation, and strand occupation on WRN helicase activity.Inhibition of WRN Helicase Activity by a Single BcPh DE-dA Adduct in the Strand on Which WRN Translocates—We first tested helicase substrates with the single BcPh DE-dA adduct positioned centrally in the duplex tract on the strand on which WRN translocates (substrates 1–5). For all of the five substrates tested, the percent duplex DNA substrate unwound depended on the concentration of WRN present in the reaction (Fig. 1). For both the adducted and unadducted forked-duplex (20 bp) substrates, WRN exonuclease activity at the blunt end of the DNA substrate was minimal (<2%) as evidenced by the appearance of an intact released oligonucleotide on native gels (Fig. 1A) and confirmed by analysis of products on urea-denaturing gels (data not shown). Similar DNA unwinding of substrate 1-unadducted by an exonuclease-defective mutant WRN protein (WRN-E84A) was also observed (data not shown). These results are consistent with a previous observation that displacement of short (16 and 22 bp) duplex tracts by WRN helicase activity is more rapid than digestion by the WRN exonuclease activity (51Opresko P.L. Laine J.P. Brosh Jr., R.M. Seidman M.M. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44677-44687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Significant inhibition of WRN helicase activity by all four BcPh DE adducts was detected at all of the WRN concentrations tested, and the extent of helicase inhibition depended on the stereochemistry of the specific adduct (Fig. 1). Notably, the cis-opened adducts inhibited WRN unwinding more effectively than the trans-adducts (Fig. 1B). This difference was statistically significant at WRN protein concentrations of 2.4 and 4.8 nm. At a WRN concentration of 2.4 nm (Fig. 1B), the 5-cis-S adduct profoundly inhibited helicase"
https://openalex.org/W1964161644,"We previously showed that COL1A1 expression is up-regulated at the transcriptional level in systemic sclerosis (SSc) fibroblasts and that the CCAAT-binding factor (CBF) is involved in this increased expression. Ecteinascidin 743 (ET-743) is a chemotherapeutic agent that binds with sequence specificity to the minor groove of DNA and inhibits CBF-mediated transcriptional activation of numerous genes. Therefore, we examined the effects of ET-743 on the increased COL1A1 expression in SSc fibroblasts. The drug caused a potent and dose-dependent inhibition of type I collagen biosynthesis, which reached 70-90% at 700 pm without affecting cell viability. The same drug concentration caused 60-80% reduction in COL1A1 mRNA levels. The stability of the corresponding transcripts was not affected. In vitro nuclear transcription assays demonstrated a 54% down-regulation of COL1A1 transcription. Transient transfections with COL1A1 promoter constructs containing the specific CBF binding sequence into SSc cells previously treated with 700 pm ET-743 failed to show an effect on COL1A1 promoter activity. Furthermore, ET-743 did not affect the binding of CBF or Sp1 transcription factors to their cognate COL1A1 elements. However, treatment with 700 pm ET-743 of stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells expressing a human type II procollagen gene under the control of the human COL1A1 promoter caused a greater than 50% reduction in the production of type II procollagen and a similar decrease in the corresponding type II procollagen transcripts. These results indicate that ET-743 is a potent inhibitor of COL1A1 transcription. However, this effect cannot be explained by a direct effect on CBF binding to the COL1A1 promoter. Although the exact mechanisms responsible for the transcriptional inhibition of COL1A1 by ET-743 are not apparent, our observations suggest that the drug may be an effective agent to decrease collagen overproduction in SSc and other fibrotic diseases."
