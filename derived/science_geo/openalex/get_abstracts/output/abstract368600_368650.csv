https://openalex.org/W2010957046,"In these new reports, three different research groups independently find that various T cell populations are crucial mediators of obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction. They also show that pharmacological approaches that target these T cells are beneficial, thus opening the door to possible new therapeutic approaches to treating obesity-related diseases such as diabetes ( pages 846–847 , 914–920 and 921–929 ). Obesity is accompanied by chronic, low-grade inflammation of adipose tissue, which promotes insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes. These findings raise the question of how fat inflammation can escape the powerful armamentarium of cells and molecules normally responsible for guarding against a runaway immune response. CD4+ Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells with a unique phenotype were highly enriched in the abdominal fat of normal mice, but their numbers were strikingly and specifically reduced at this site in insulin-resistant models of obesity. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments revealed that these Treg cells influenced the inflammatory state of adipose tissue and, thus, insulin resistance. Cytokines differentially synthesized by fat-resident regulatory and conventional T cells directly affected the synthesis of inflammatory mediators and glucose uptake by cultured adipocytes. These observations suggest that harnessing the anti-inflammatory properties of Treg cells to inhibit elements of the metabolic syndrome may have therapeutic potential."

However, genomic diversity is difficult to generate in the laboratory and new phenotypes do not easily arise on practical timescales. Although in vitro and directed evolution methods have created genetic variants with usefully altered phenotypes, these methods are limited to laborious and serial manipulation of single genes and are not used for parallel and continuous directed evolution of gene networks or genomes. Here, we describe multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) for large-scale programming and evolution of cells. MAGE simultaneously targets many locations on the chromosome for modification in a single cell or across a population of cells, thus producing combinatorial genomic diversity. Because the process is cyclical and scalable, we constructed prototype devices that automate the MAGE technology to facilitate rapid and continuous generation of a diverse set of genetic changes (mismatches, insertions, deletions). We applied MAGE to optimize the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce the industrially important isoprenoid lycopene. Twenty-four genetic components in the DXP pathway were modified simultaneously using a complex pool of synthetic DNA, creating over 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic variants per day. We isolated variants with more than fivefold increase in lycopene production within 3 days, a significant improvement over existing metabolic engineering techniques. Our multiplex approach embraces engineering in the context of evolution by expediting the design and evolution of organisms with new and improved properties."
https://openalex.org/W2097126393,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is organized as a cellular hierarchy initiated and maintained by a subset of self-renewing leukemia stem cells (LSC). We hypothesized that increased CD47 expression on human AML LSC contributes to pathogenesis by inhibiting their phagocytosis through the interaction of CD47 with an inhibitory receptor on phagocytes. We found that CD47 was more highly expressed on AML LSC than their normal counterparts, and that increased CD47 expression predicted worse overall survival in three independent cohorts of adult AML patients. Furthermore, blocking monoclonal antibodies directed against CD47 preferentially enabled phagocytosis of AML LSC and inhibited their engraftment in vivo. Finally, treatment of human AML LSC-engrafted mice with anti-CD47 antibody depleted AML and targeted AML LSC. In summary, increased CD47 expression is an independent, poor prognostic factor that can be targeted on human AML stem cells with blocking monoclonal antibodies capable of enabling phagocytosis of LSC."
https://openalex.org/W2103746815,"Macrophages clear pathogens and damaged or aged cells from the blood stream via phagocytosis. Cell-surface CD47 interacts with its receptor on macrophages, SIRPalpha, to inhibit phagocytosis of normal, healthy cells. We find that mobilizing cytokines and inflammatory stimuli cause CD47 to be transiently upregulated on mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitors just prior to and during their migratory phase, and that the level of CD47 on these cells determines the probability that they are engulfed in vivo. CD47 is also constitutively upregulated on mouse and human myeloid leukemias, and overexpression of CD47 on a myeloid leukemia line increases its pathogenicity by allowing it to evade phagocytosis. We conclude that CD47 upregulation is an important mechanism that provides protection to normal HSCs during inflammation-mediated mobilization, and that leukemic progenitors co-opt this ability in order to evade macrophage killing."
https://openalex.org/W2087573417,"Gary Felsenfeld and colleagues examine the distribution of H3.3- and H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes genome-wide. They find that regions at transcription start sites of active genes, which were thought to be “nucleosome-free regions,” are enriched for unstable H2A.Z and H3.3 double-variant nucleosomes. These results suggest that double-variant nucleosomes may be important in the regulation of transcription factor access to promoters. To understand how chromatin structure is organized by different histone variants, we have measured the genome-wide distribution of nucleosome core particles (NCPs) containing the histone variants H3.3 and H2A.Z in human cells. We find that a special class of NCPs containing both variants is enriched at 'nucleosome-free regions' of active promoters, enhancers and insulator regions. We show that preparative methods used previously in studying nucleosome structure result in the loss of these unstable double-variant NCPs. It seems likely that this instability facilitates the access of transcription factors to promoters and other regulatory sites in vivo. Other combinations of variants have different distributions, consistent with distinct roles for histone variants in the modulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2059261163,"Mast cells, which are involved in inflammation and wound healing, have now been shown to have a role in obesity and diabetes in a new report by Guo-Ping Shi and his colleagues. They go on to show that pharmacological inhibition of mast cell function is sufficient to reduce these metabolic disturbances in mice, suggesting a new therapeutic avenue in the clinic for these disorders. Although mast cell functions have classically been related to allergic responses1,2,3, recent studies indicate that these cells contribute to other common diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysm and cancer4,5,6,7,8. This study presents evidence that mast cells also contribute to diet-induced obesity and diabetes. For example, white adipose tissue (WAT) from obese humans and mice contain more mast cells than WAT from their lean counterparts. Furthermore, in the context of mice on a Western diet, genetically induced deficiency of mast cells, or their pharmacological stabilization, reduces body weight gain and levels of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases in serum and WAT, in concert with improved glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure. Mechanistic studies reveal that mast cells contribute to WAT and muscle angiogenesis and associated cell apoptosis and cathepsin activity. Adoptive transfer experiments of cytokine-deficient mast cells show that these cells, by producing interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), contribute to mouse adipose tissue cysteine protease cathepsin expression, apoptosis and angiogenesis, thereby promoting diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. Our results showing reduced obesity and diabetes in mice treated with clinically available mast cell-stabilizing agents suggest the potential of developing new therapies for these common human metabolic disorders."

Microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) associate with growing microtubule plus ends and control microtubule dynamics and interactions with different cellular structures during cell division, migration, and morphogenesis. EB1 and its homologs are highly conserved proteins that play an important role in the targeting of +TIPs to microtubule ends, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. By using live cell experiments and in vitro reconstitution assays, we demonstrate that a short polypeptide motif, Ser-x-Ile-Pro (SxIP), is used by numerous +TIPs, including the tumor suppressor APC, the transmembrane protein STIM1, and the kinesin MCAK, for localization to microtubule tips in an EB1-dependent manner. Structural and biochemical data reveal the molecular basis of the EB1-SxIP interaction and explain its negative regulation by phosphorylation.

Our findings establish a general “microtubule tip localization signal” (MtLS) and delineate a unifying mechanism for this subcellular protein targeting process. +TIPs constitute a diverse group of evolutionarily conserved microtubule-associated proteins that specifically accumulate at the ends of growing microtubules (Schuyler and Pellman, 2001Schuyler S.C.

They play important roles in essential cellular activities, including chromosome segregation, cell polarization and migration, organelle transport, and intracellular signaling. Furthermore, +TIPs are also implicated in coordinating complex aspects of cell shape and architecture and in the development of cancer (for reviews, see Galjart and Perez, 2003Galjart N. Perez F.

End binding protein-1 (EB1) recently emerged as a master regulator of dynamic +TIP interaction networks at growing microtubule ends. Two facts underline its central role. First, EB1 and its family members autonomously track microtubule tips independent of any binding partners, most likely by recognizing structural features of growing microtubule ends (Sandblad et al., 2006Sandblad L.

Second, the C-terminal moiety of EB1 (denoted EB1c) binds to an array of structurally and functionally unrelated +TIP binding partners, including the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein, the microtubule-actin crosslinking factor (MACF), the cytoplasmic linker protein (CLIP170), CLIP-associated proteins (CLASPs), the transmembrane protein stromal interaction molecule-1 (STIM1), the dynactin large subunit p150glued, and the mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK) (reviewed in Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008Akhmanova A.

The structure of the C-terminal domain of EB1 has been elucidated by X-ray crystallography (Honnappa et al., 2005Honnappa S. John C.M. Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Steinmetz M.O.

However, a general molecular basis of microtubule tip tracking for the majority of EB1-binding partners, which do not contain CAP-Gly domains, remains elusive. A major reason for this lack of knowledge is that prominent +TIPs, such as APC, MACF, CLASPs, STIM1, and MCAK, do not use well-defined, folded domains for EB1 targeting, which makes both functional and structural studies challenging. Work with APC and MACF suggested that these two proteins both contain an intrinsically unstructured sequence region of approximately 40 residues that binds to EB proteins in vitro (Bu and Su, 2003Bu W. Su L.K. Characterization of functional domains of human EB1 family proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49721-49731Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, Honnappa et al., 2005Honnappa S. John C.M.

Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Based on a crystal contact artifact seen in uncomplexed EB1c crystals and mutagenesis, we previously showed that an Ile-Pro dipeptide is important for the interaction of an APC-derived polypeptide fragment with EB1c in vitro (Honnappa et al., 2005Honnappa S. John C.M. Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Steinmetz M.O. Structural insights into the EB1-APC interaction.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, it was left open whether these sequence regions and amino acid determinants regulate the microtubule plus-end tracking activity of APC and MACF in cells and, more importantly, whether or not they define a general motif for +TIP interaction with EB1 and for localization to microtubule ends. Despite the recent progress in understanding EB-dependent microtubule plus-end targeting, many basic questions remain unresolved. (1) Is there a direct correlation between EB1 binding and microtubule plus-end tracking of +TIPs? (2) How is it possible for EB1 proteins to recognize the diverse range of +TIPs in spite of little or no sequence homology among them? (3) What are the sequence requirements and mechanisms that regulate the targeting of +TIPs to EB1 and microtubule ends? By using a multidisciplinary approach, we address these questions in detail in this paper. We establish that the highly conserved C-terminal domain of EB1 recognizes a short linear sequence motif found in a large number of important +TIPs for microtubule plus-end tracking, determine the recognition mechanism in atomic detail, and show how phosphorylation regulates EB1 binding and microtubule tip-targeting activity. Our findings reveal that microtubule plus-end tracking of individual +TIPs in cells can be abrogated by specific mutations in a short sequence stretch, opening the way for detailed analysis of the role of microtubule tip localization in many fundamental cellular activities. On a broader scope, they provide a unifying view of an important subcellular protein targeting process responsible for the dynamic behavior of an array of functionally and structurally diverse proteins. To test whether structurally and functionally diverse +TIPs share common sequence motifs, we performed a sequence analysis with the DILIMOT algorithm (see Experimental Procedures). Two related sequence stretches, Ser-x-Ile-Pro-x-Pro and Ser-x-Ile-Pro, were identified as high-significance motif candidates (henceforth termed the SxIP motif, where x denotes any amino acid residue; Figure 1) present within sequence domains that were predicted to be intrinsically disordered. Inspection of the regions flanking the SxIP motif reveals little if any conservation between +TIP families outside of this motif, although high content of serine, proline, and basic residues is evident. This analysis suggests that SxIP motifs embedded within basic and proline/serine-rich sequence regions are characteristic features of +TIPs such as APC, MACF, CLASP, STIM1, and MCAK. To determine the functional significance of SxIP motifs, we prepared GFP-tagged APC and MACF2 fragments and analyzed their interaction with EB1 by GST pull-down assays and their localization in cells by time-lapse imaging. 39- and 43-residue fragments derived from the C-terminal regions of APC and MACF2 (APC39 and MACF43), respectively, each encompassing one SxIP motif, interacted with EB1 and weakly but significantly tracked growing microtubule ends (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2J; Movies S1 and S2 available online). In order to interfere with EB1 binding and microtubule tip tracking, we replaced the hydrophobic Ile-Pro dipeptide in the SxIP motif of MACF43 (Ile5479 and Pro5480 of human MACF2) with the residues Asn-Asn (MACF43-NN), hypothesizing that if the Ile-Pro dipeptide makes contacts with a hydrophobic surface of EB1, this interaction would be weakened by two polar residues (Honnappa et al., 2005Honnappa S. John C.M. Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Steinmetz M.O. Structural insights into the EB1-APC interaction.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This residue substitution indeed eliminated binding to EB1 as well as microtubule tip tracking (Figures 2C and 2J; Movie S1). Replacement of the three basic MACF43 residues Lys5478, Arg5484, and Lys5485 within or in the vicinity of the SxIP motif with the polar residues Gln, Asn, and Asn, respectively (MACF43-QNN), also abolished EB1 binding and microtubule end localization (Figures 2D and 2J; Movie S1). Finally, single-site substitutions targeting the serine (replacement with Ala or Asn), isoleucine (Asn), or proline (Asn) residues of SxIP were sufficient to abrogate microtubule tip tracking (Figure S1). These findings suggest that the identity of the residues at the SxIP motif positions 1, 3, and 4 as well as the presence of basic residues flanking SxIP are important for both binding to EB1 and for tracking of growing microtubule ends in cells. Another well-studied +TIP fragment, CLASP2M, which is derived from the central part of human CLASP2, interacts with EB1 and robustly tracks growing microtubule ends (Figures 2F and 2J; Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2005Mimori-Kiyosue Y. Grigoriev I. Lansbergen G. Sasaki H. Matsui C. Severin F. Galjart N. Grosveld F. Vorobjev I. Tsukita S. Akhmanova A. CLASP1 and CLASP2 bind to EB1 and regulate microtubule plus-end dynamics at the cell cortex.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that human CLASP2 contains two tandemly repeated SxIP motifs within the CLASP2M fragment (Figure 1). To assess the role of these two motifs, we replaced the Ile-Pro dipeptides of the two SxIP motifs individually or simultaneously with the polar dipeptide Ser-Ser (CLASP2M-SS1, CLASP2M-SS2, and CLASP2M-SS12). Introducing Ser-Ser into either of the SxIP motifs of CLASP2M alone did not reduce binding to EB1 in GST pull-down experiments, but it significantly reduced accumulation of the two CLASPM mutants at microtubule tips (Figures 2G, 2H, and 2J; Movie S5). In contrast, CLASP2M-SS12 displayed a strong reduction in EB1 binding and failed to localize to growing microtubule ends (Figures 2I and 2J; Movie S5). To test the hypothesis that the two SxIP motifs of CLASPM cooperate to enhance microtubule tip tracking, we performed experiments with other +TIP polypeptides. A short 18-residue fragment of MACF43 (MACF18) shows only weak but significant localization to polymerizing microtubule ends (Figure S2; Movie S3). This localization was greatly enhanced by generating a dimeric version of this peptide through N-terminal fusion to the two-stranded leucine zipper (LZ) coiled-coil domain of GCN4 (MACF18LZ; Figure S2; Movie S3). Remarkably, robust plus end tracking was still observed with a dimer of a 12-residue MACF2 peptide (MACF12LZ; Figures 1 and 2E; Movie S4), showing that a surprisingly short polypeptide can mediate microtubule plus-end localization. Dimerization of APC39 (APC39LZ) also resulted in a strong increase in microtubule tip accumulation (Figure S2; Movie S2). These findings show that concerted action of two SxIP motifs considerably enhances the affinity of +TIPs for growing microtubule plus ends. Next, we designed experiments with the intention to interfere with the microtubule tip tracking activities of more complex, full-length +TIPs in cells. The first set of experiments was performed with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein STIM1. STIM1 contains an N-terminal intra-ER moiety, which is followed by a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic C-terminal part that includes an SxIP motif (note that the serine is conservatively replaced by a threonine; Figure 1). Wild-type STIM1 (STIM1-WT) bound EB1 in GST pull-down experiments and tracked microtubule ends at sites where growing microtubule tips contacted the ER membrane network (Figures 3A and 3F; Movie S6; Grigoriev et al., 2008Grigoriev I. Gouveia S.M. van der Vaart B. Demmers J. Smyth J.T. Honnappa S. Splinter D. Steinmetz M.O. Putney Jr., J.W. Hoogenraad C.C. Akhmanova A. STIM1 is a MT-plus-end-tracking protein involved in remodeling of the ER.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 177-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Replacement of the Ile-Pro dipeptide of the SxIP motif by Asn-Asn (STIM1-NN) abrogated both binding to EB1 and microtubule plus-end tracking (Figures 3B and 3F; Figure S3; Movie S6). We performed a similar set of experiments with the microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin-13 MCAK. MCAK is a dimer that consists of an N-terminal domain with an SxIP motif (Figure 1), followed by a central motor domain and a C-terminal tail. GFP-tagged wild-type MCAK (MCAK-WT) interacted with EB1, bound the microtubule lattice, and strongly accumulated at polymerizing microtubule ends (Figures 3C and 3F; Figure S3; Movie S7; Moore et al., 2005Moore A.T. Rankin K.E. von Dassow G. Peris L. Wagenbach M. Ovechkina Y. Andrieux A. Job D. Wordeman L. MCAK associates with the tips of polymerizing microtubules.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast, an MCAK mutant in which the Ile-Pro dipeptide of the SxIP motif was substituted by Asn-Asn (MCAK-NN) displayed no binding to EB1 and no accumulation at microtubule ends, although it could still bind along the microtubule shaft (Figures 3D and 3F; Figure S3; Movie S7). In addition to MCAK, the human kinesin-13 family includes KIF2A and KIF2B, which contain no SxIP motifs within their N termini and are thus predicted not to track microtubule ends. Indeed, both proteins failed to accumulate at polymerizing microtubule ends although they weakly bound microtubule shafts as observed for MCAK-WT and MCAK-NN (Figure S4; Movie S8; Moore et al., 2005Moore A.T. Rankin K.E. von Dassow G. Peris L. Wagenbach M. Ovechkina Y. Andrieux A. Job D. Wordeman L. MCAK associates with the tips of polymerizing microtubules.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Taken together, our findings show that a diverse range of +TIPs use SxIP motifs embedded within basic and proline/serine-rich sequence regions to bind to EB1 and to localize to growing microtubule plus ends. Furthermore, tracking of microtubule ends is greatly enhanced by repetition of the SxIP motif within a +TIP or by oligomerization of SxIP motif-containing +TIPs. +TIPs are frequently the target of kinases at multiple sites (Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. Tracking the ends: a dynamic protein network controls the fate of microtubule tips.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). For example, Ser2789 and Ser2793, which are both in the vicinity of the SxIP motif identified in human APC (Figure 1, underlined), represent Cdc2 and GSK-3β phosphorylation sites, respectively (Nathke, 2004Nathke I.S. The adenomatous polyposis coli protein: the Achilles heel of the gut epithelium.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 337-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The effect of phosphorylation at these sites on binding to the C-terminal domain of EB1 (EB1c) was assessed in vitro by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) with a polypeptide corresponding to the sequence of APC39 (APCp1; Bu and Su, 2003Bu W.

Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Steinmetz M.O. Structural insights into the EB1-APC interaction.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). ITC revealed that two APCp1 peptides bind to one EB1c dimer, with an equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, of 5.8 ± 0.1 μM (Figure S5), consistent with previous findings (Honnappa et al., 2005Honnappa S.

The function of MCAK is well known to be regulated by Aurora B phosphorylation (Andrews et al., 2004Andrews P.D. Ovechkina Y. Morrice N. Wagenbach M. Duncan K. Wordeman L. Swedlow J.R. Aurora B regulates MCAK at the mitotic centromere.Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 253-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, Lan et al., 2004Lan W. Zhang X. Kline-Smith S.L.

Aurora B phosphorylates centromeric MCAK and regulates its localization and microtubule depolymerization activity.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 273-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, four out of the five Aurora B phosphorylation sites, i.e., Ser95, Ser109, Ser111, and Ser115, cluster in the vicinity of the SxIP motif (Figure 1, underlined). To mimic phosphorylation at these sites, we simultaneously mutated three of these serine residues, Ser95, Ser109, and Ser111, to glutamate (MCAK-3E). In cells, the phosphomimicking MCAK mutant accumulated along microtubules in a manner that was similar to the wild-type protein. In contrast to the wild-type protein, however, MCAK-3E bound only very weakly to EB1 in GST pull-down experiments and failed to track growing microtubule ends (Figures 3E and 3F; Movie S7). This finding is in agreement with a previous study showing that mutating all five Aurora B phosphorylation sites to glutamates abolishes microtubule tip tracking (Moore et al., 2005Moore A.T. Rankin K.E. von Dassow G. Peris L. Wagenbach M. Ovechkina Y. Andrieux A. Job D. Wordeman L. MCAK associates with the tips of polymerizing microtubules.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A recent study suggested that GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of several serine residues surrounding the SxIP sites of CLASP2 interferes with the binding to EB1 and to microtubule tips (Kumar et al., 2009Kumar P. Lyle K.S. Gierke S. Matov A. Danuser G. Wittmann T. GSK3beta phosphorylation modulates CLASP-microtubule association and lamella microtubule attachment.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 895-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Overall, these data demonstrate that phosphorylation in the vicinity of SxIP motifs negatively regulates the localization of +TIPs to microtubule ends by decreasing their affinity for EB1. To test whether EB1 is sufficient for localizing proteins containing SxIP motifs to growing microtubule ends, we reconstituted the process with purified components (Bieling et al., 2007Bieling P. Laan L. Schek H. Munteanu E.L. Sandblad L. Dogterom M. Brunner D. Surrey T.

GFP-labeled human EB1-tracked growing microtubule ends as previously described (Figure 4A; Movie S9; Bieling et al., 2007Bieling P. Laan L. Schek H. Munteanu E.L. Sandblad L. Dogterom M. Brunner D.

In the presence of unlabeled EB1, both GFP-tagged MACF43 and a 436-residue C-terminal fragment of STIM1 encompassing the SxIP motif (STIM1c; Grigoriev et al., 2008Grigoriev I.

In the absence of EB1, however, we observed only microtubule lattice binding but no tip localization of MACF43 and STIM1c (Figure S6). Given that modification of the SxIP motif within +TIPs has been shown to interfere with their localization to growing microtubule tips in cells (Figure 2, Figure 3), these in vitro results imply that the EB1-SxIP motif interaction is not only necessary but also sufficient for many +TIPs to track growing microtubule ends. To obtain insight into the structural basis of SxIP motif recognition by EB1, we attempted to crystallize a complex formed between EB1c and a representative peptide from one of the +TIPs. After screening of different constructs, we succeeded in solving the structure of an EB1c fragment lacking the last 8 C-terminal residues (EB1cΔC8) in a complex with a 30-residue peptide derived from the C-terminal region of human MACF2 (MACFp1; residues 5468–5497) at 2.5 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography (Table 1; Figure 5).Table 1X-Ray Data Collection and Refinement StatisticsEB1cΔC8-MACFp1Wavelength, Å1.0009Space group (no.)P21 (4)Resolution range, Å50-2.5 (2.56-2.5)Unit cell, a, b, and c in Å45.6, 44.9, 74.8, β = 98.6°No. of observed reflections31520No. of unique reflections10167RsymbRsym = ∑h∑i | Ii(h) − <I(h)> | / ∑h∑iIi(h), where Ii(h) and < I(h) > are the ith and mean measurement of the intensity of reflection h., %8.8 (42.6)aFigures in parentheses indicate the values for the outer shell of the data.I/σ (I)9.9 (3.4)aFigures in parentheses indicate the values for the outer shell of the data.Completeness, %96.1 (97.6)aFigures in parentheses indicate the values for the outer shell of the data.No. of Refined AtomsProteins/peptides2290Water19R-factor/free R-factorcR = ∑|FPobs − FPcalc|/ ∑FPobs, where FPobs and FPcalc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively.0.22/0.25Rmsd bond lengths/bond anglesdRmsd, root-mean-square-deviation from the parameter set for ideal stereochemistry.0.01/1.1a Figures in parentheses indicate the values for the outer shell of the data.b Rsym = ∑h∑i | Ii(h) − <I(h)> | / ∑h∑iIi(h), where Ii(h) and < I(h) > are the ith and mean measurement of the intensity of reflection h.c R = ∑|FPobs − FPcalc|/ ∑FPobs, where FPobs and FPcalc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively.d Rmsd, root-mean-square-deviation from the parameter set for ideal stereochemistry.

In this study, we investigated the hyaluronan (HA)-induced interaction between CD44 (a primary HA receptor) and protein kinase Cϵ (PKCϵ), which regulates a number of human breast tumor cell functions. Our results indicate that HA binding to CD44 promotes PKCϵ activation, which, in turn, increases the phosphorylation of the stem cell marker, Nanog, in the breast tumor cell line MCF-7. Phosphorylated Nanog is then translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus and becomes associated with RNase III DROSHA and the RNA helicase p68. This process leads to microRNA-21 (miR-21) production and a tumor suppressor protein (e.g. PDCD4 (program cell death 4)) reduction. All of these events contribute to up-regulation of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and MDR1 (multidrug-resistant protein), resulting in anti-apoptosis and chemotherapy resistance. Transfection of MCF-7 cells with PKCϵ or Nanog-specific small interfering RNAs effectively blocks HA-mediated PKCϵ-Nanog signaling events, abrogates miR-21 production, and increases PDCD4 expression/eIF4A binding. Subsequently, this PKCϵ-Nanog signaling inhibition causes IAP/MDR1 down-regulation, apoptosis, and chemosensitivity. To further evaluate the role of miR-21 in oncogenesis and chemoresistance, MCF-7 cells were also transfected with a specific anti-miR-21 inhibitor in order to silence miR-21 expression and inhibit its target functions. Our results indicate that anti-miR-21 inhibitor not only enhances PDCD4 expression/eIF4A binding but also blocks HA-CD44-mediated tumor cell behaviors. Thus, this newly discovered HA-CD44 signaling pathway should provide important drug targets for sensitizing tumor cell apoptosis and overcoming chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer cells.

A number of studies have aimed at identifying those molecules that are specifically expressed by epithelial tumor cells and correlate with metastatic behavior and chemoresistance.

HA is a nonsulfated, unbranched glycosaminoglycan, consisting of repeating disaccharide units, d-glucuronic acid, and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (9Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.

The biosynthesis of HA is regulated by three mammalian HA synthase isozymes, HA synthase 1, 2, and 3 (11Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol.

Underhill C.B. Chen L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 428-433PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, HA is digested into a variety of smaller-sized molecules by various hyaluronidases (16Stern R. Jedrzejas M.J. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 818-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Activation of extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes, such as the hyaluronidases, appears to be closely associated with tumor progression (17Bourguignon L.Y. Singleton P.A. Diedrich F. Stern R. Gilad E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26991-27007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In addition, HA is enriched in many types of tumors (18Haylock D.N. Nilsson S.K.

In certain tumor types, the level of HA has been found to be predictive of malignancy (19Toole B.P. Wight T.N. Tammi M.I. J. Biol.

CD44 is generally expressed in a variety of isoforms that are products of a single gene generated by alternative splicing of variant exons inserted into an extracellular membrane-proximal site (25Screaton G.R.

CD44 is also expressed in tumor stem cells that have the unique ability to initiate tumor cell-specific properties (27Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S. Benito-Hernandez A. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3983-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (8334) Google Scholar). In fact, CD44 is proposed to be one of the important surface markers on cancer stem cells (27Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S.

HA binding to CD44 is known to be involved in the stimulation of both receptor kinases (e.g. ErbB2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and TGFβ receptors) and non-receptor kinases (e.g. c-Src and ROK) (28Bourguignon L.Y.

Protein kinase C (PKC), a family of serine-threonine kinases, plays a pivotal role in signal transduction and a number of cellular functions (35Gorin M.A. Pan Q. Mol. Cancer. 2009; 8: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It consists of at least 11 different isoforms, including the novel type of PKC isoforms, such as PKCϵ (36Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). A previous study found that PKCϵ is associated with the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins (37Steinberg R. Harari O.A. Lidington E.A. Boyle J.J. Nohadani M. Samarel A.M. Ohba M. Haskard D.O. Mason J.C. J. Biol.

PKC also functions to prevent apoptosis in a number of cells by up-regulating inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) proteins (e.g. X-linked IAP (XIAP) and survivin) and by inhibiting caspases (37Steinberg R. Harari O.A. Lidington E.A. Boyle J.J. Nohadani M. Samarel A.M. Ohba M. Haskard D.O. Mason J.C. J. Biol.

Down-regulation of PKCϵ by treating cells with PKC inhibitors sensitizes tumor necrosis factor-α-mediated cell death in breast tumor cells (39Basu A. Mohanty S. Sun B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, PKCϵ appears to be functionally linked to anti-apoptotic effects and survival pathways in tumor cells. In addition, activation of certain PKC isoforms has been implicated in the induction and maintenance of the multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype (40Hofmann J. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 125-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Specifically, an increase in PKCϵ expression is closely associated with the drug-resistant phenotype in epithelial tumor cells (40Hofmann J. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 125-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the product of the MDR1 (ABCB1) gene, is a transmembrane ATP-dependent transporter known to play a role in drug fluxes and chemotherapeutic resistance in a variety of cancers (41Baker E.K. El-Osta A. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).

The question of whether there is a functional link between PKCϵ and Nanog signaling in HA-CD44-mediated oncogenesis and drug resistance in breast tumor cells has not yet been addressed. The miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved and function as negative regulators of gene expression by inhibiting the expression of mRNAs that contain complementary target sites referred to as the “seed region” (49Cowland J.B. Hother C. Grønbaek K. APMIS. 2007; 115: 1090-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Previous data have revealed that human miRNAs are processed from capped and polyadenylated transcripts that are precursors to the mature miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) (50Cai X. Hagedorn C.H. Cullen B.R. RNA. 2004; 10: 1957-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). In mammalian miRNA biogenesis, primary transcripts of miRNA genes (pri-mRNAs) are subsequently cleaved to produce an intermediate molecule containing a stem loop of ∼70 nucleotides (pre-mRNAs) by the nuclear RNase III enzyme DROSHA and exported from the nucleus by exportin 5 (49Cowland J.B. Hother C. Grønbaek K. APMIS. 2007; 115: 1090-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A second RNase III enzyme, Dicer, then generates the mature miRNA, which is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex in association with the argonaute protein that induces silencing via the RNA interference pathway (51Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Liu J. Hannon G.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Although Dicer has an important role in the silencing action of miRNAs, recent studies have shown that silencing can still occur in cells that lack Dicer (52Giraldez A.J. Cinalli R.M. Glasner M.E. Enright A.J. Thomson J.M. Baskerville S. Hammond S.M. Bartel D.P. Schier A.F. Science. 2005; 308: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that the nuclear p68-RNA helicase is required in the uptake of certain miRNAs into the silencing complex (53Salzman D.W. Shubert-Coleman J. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32773-32779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). p68 belongs to a family of proteins that are involved in RNA metabolism processes, such as translation and RNA degradation (54de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 192-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). A previous study showed that miR-21 processing or biogenesis (via the precursor pri-miR-21) required p68 and DROSHA in breast tumor cells (55Davis B.N. Hilyard A.C. Lagna G. Hata A. Nature. 2008; 454: 51-61Google Scholar). Several transcription factors, including Nanog, also appear to be involved in the regulation of pri-miRNA expression during development (56Lee Y. Kim M. Han J. Yeom K.H. Lee S. Baek S.H. Kim V.N. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4051-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (3208) Google Scholar). Whether HA-CD44-mediated signaling is involved in miR-21 maturation/production and chemotherapy resistance in breast tumor cells has not been determined. Accumulating evidence indicates the involvement of non-coding miRNAs (∼22 nucleotides) in both cancer development and multidrug resistance (57Si M.L. Zhu S. Wu H. Lu Z. Wu F. Mo Y.Y. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2799-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Analysis of the array profile of miRNA expression in normal breast and breast carcinoma tissues reveals that miRNA-21 (miR-21) is abundantly produced in tumors compared with normal tissues (57Si M.L. Zhu S. Wu H. Lu Z. Wu F. Mo Y.Y. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2799-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). The functional significance of miR-21 has been elucidated in several recent studies following the discovery of its specific targets (58Asangani I.A. Rasheed S.A. Nikolova D.A. Leupold J.H. Colburn N.H. Post S. Allgayer H. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2128-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). miR-21 is now one of the most studied miRNAs due to its involvement in cancer progression. It has recently been shown that miR-21 plays a role in the inhibition of a tumor suppressor protein, such as PDCD4 (program cell death 4) via a conserved site within the 3′-untranslated region of the mRNA (58Asangani I.A. Rasheed S.A. Nikolova D.A. Leupold J.H. Colburn N.H. Post S. Allgayer H. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2128-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar, 82Wickramasinghe N.S. Manavalan T.T. Dougherty S.M. Riggs K.A. Li Y. Klinge C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 2584-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of PDCD4 expression by miR-21 leads to tissue invasion and metastasis (58Asangani I.A. Rasheed S.A. Nikolova D.A. Leupold J.H. Colburn N.H. Post S. Allgayer H. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2128-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar, 82Wickramasinghe N.S. Manavalan T.T. Dougherty S.M. Riggs K.A. Li Y. Klinge C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 2584-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Thus, miR-21 is currently considered to be an oncogene. In this study, we have investigated a novel HA-CD44-mediated PKCϵ signaling mechanism that regulates the stem cell marker (Nanog)-associated miR-21 production. Our results indicate that HA-CD44-activated PKCϵ stimulates Nanog phosphorylation, which in turn, activates Nanog signaling-regulated miR-21 production. These events lead to the tumor suppressor protein (PDCD4) reduction, IAP/MDR1 (P-gp) overexpression, anti-apoptosis, and chemoresistance in breast tumor cells. Inhibition of either PKCϵ-Nanog signaling or silencing of miR-21 expression/function by transfecting breast tumor cells with PKCϵ siRNA (or Nanog siRNA) or anti-miR-21 inhibitor not only results in PDCD4 up-regulation and PDCD4-eIF4A complex formation but also causes a reduction of IAP/MDR1 (P-gp) and an enhancement of apoptosis and chemosensitivity. Our findings provide important new insights into understanding the roles that HA-CD44-mediated PKCϵ activation and Nanog-regulated miR-21 play in regulating anti-apoptosis and chemotherapy resistance in breast tumor cells. Human breast tumor cell line MCF-7 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were routinely serum-starved (and thereby deprived of serum HA) before adding HA.

Immunoreagents, such as rabbit anti-PKCϵ antibody, goat anti-Nanog antibody, mouse anti-PDCD4 antibody, rabbit anti-MDR1 (P-glycoprotein 170) antibody, and goat anti-actin antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Several immunoreagents, including rabbit anti-DROSHA antibody, mouse anti-p68 antibody, and rabbit anti-phosphoserine antibody, were obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Rabbit anti-eIF4A and rabbit anti-survivin were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA) and Abcam (Cambridge, MA), respectively. Mouse anti-XIAP antibody was from BD Biosciences. Doxorubicin hydrochloride and paclitaxel (Taxol) were obtained from Sigma. Healon HA polymers (∼500,000-dalton polymers), purchased from Amersham Biosciences and The Upjohn Co. were prepared by gel filtration column chromatography, using a Sephacryl S1000 column. The purity of the HA polymers used in our experiments was further verified by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography, followed by protein and endotoxin analyses, using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and an in vitro limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Cambrex Bio Science, Inc., Walkersville, MD), respectively. No protein or endotoxin contamination was detected in this HA preparation. PKCϵ substrate peptide-2 was obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA). The siRNA sequence targeting human PKCϵ and Nanog (from mRNA sequence; GenBankTM accession number NM_005400 and NM_024865, respectively) corresponds to the coding region relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon. Target sequences were selected, using the software developed by Ambion Inc. As recommended by Ambion, PKCϵ- or Nanog-specific targeted regions were selected beginning 50–100 nucleotides downstream from the start codon. Sequences close to 50% G/C content were chosen. Specifically, PKCϵ siRNA, PKCϵ-specific target sequence (AAGATGAAGGAGGCGCTCAGTT), and scrambled sequences were used. In the case of Nanog, Nanog-specific target sequences (target 1, AATCTTCACCTATGCCTGTGA; target 2, AATGAAATCTAAGAGGTGGA; target 3, AAACCATGGATTTATTCCTAA) and scrambled sequences were used. MCF-7 cells were then transfected with siRNA, using siPORT Lipid as transfection reagent (SilencerTM siRNA transfection kit; Ambion) according to the protocol provided by Ambion. Cells were incubated with 50 pmol of PKCϵ siRNA or Nanog siRNA or 50 pmol of siRNA containing scrambled sequences or no siRNA for at least 24 h before biochemical experiments. Anti-miRTM targeting miR-21 (anti-miR-21 inhibitor) (catalogue number 17000; Ambion) and its corresponding negative control (catalogue number 17010; Ambion) were transfected into MCF7 cells, using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) for 24 h. Cells were then treated with HA or without HA in various experiments, as described below. The final concentrations of anti-miR-21 and miRNA-negative control used in various experiments were 30 nmol/liter. MCF-7 cells (untreated or treated with PKCϵ siRNA or Nanog siRNA or siRNA with scrambled sequences or pretreated with anti-CD44 antibody) were incubated with HA (50 μg/ml) (or without HA) for various time intervals (e.g. 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, or 24 h) at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared, using the extraction kit from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA) according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. Both cell lysate and the cytosolic fraction of MCF-7 cells (pretreated with anti-CD44 antibody or transfected with PKCϵ siRNA, Nanog siRNA, siRNA with scrambled sequences, anti-miR-21 inhibitor, or miRNA-negative control or without any treatment, followed by HA (50 μg/ml) addition (or no HA addition) for various time intervals (e.g. 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, or 24 h) at 37 °C) were immunoblotted using various immunoreagents (e.g. rabbit anti-PKCϵ (2 μg/ml), goat anti-Nanog (2 μg/ml), rabbit anti-MDR1 (2 μg/ml), mouse anti-PDCD4 (2 μg/ml), rabbit anti-eIF4A (2 μg/ml), rabbit anti-survivin (2 μg/ml), mouse anti-XIAP, or goat anti-actin (2 μg/ml) (as a loading control), respectively). In addition, immunoprecipitation was conducted after homogenization of the cell lysate using rat anti-CD44 antibody, followed by goat anti-rat IgG-beads. Subsequently, the immunoprecipitated materials were solubilized in SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed, and blotted onto nitrocellulose. After blocking nonspecific sites with 3% bovine serum albumin, the nitrocellulose filters were incubated with rabbit anti-PKCϵ antibody (2 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. In some cases, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with goat anti-Nanog antibody, followed by rabbit anti-goat IgG-beads. Subsequently, the immunoprecipitated materials were processed for immunoblotting using rabbit anti-phosphoserine antibody (2 μg/ml). In some cases, the nuclear fraction of MCF-7 cells (untransfected or transfected with PKCϵ siRNA, Nanog siRNA, or scrambled sequence siRNA plus 50 μg/ml HA (or no HA) for various time intervals (e.g. 0, 5, 15, or 30 min) at 37 °C was used for rabbit anti-DROSHA antibody-conjugated immunoprecipi"

For a video summary of this article, see the PaperFlick file available with the online Supplemental Data. Transcription regulatory networks capture physical and regulatory relationships between sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs), and between TFs and their target genes (Walhout, 2006Walhout A.J.M. Unraveling Transcription Regulatory Networks by Protein-DNA and Protein-Protein Interaction Mapping.Genome Res. 2006; 16: 1445-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Paralogous TFs are grouped into families based on the type of DNA binding domain they possess. Such families grow by gene duplications upon which identical and therefore fully redundant TFs emerge. After acquiring mutations, duplicate TFs diverge and may become partially redundant. Upon further mutation completely nonredundant, yet paralogous TFs may emerge (Figure 1A). Paralogous TF families often expand with organismal complexity. For instance, whereas the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has 42 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins (Reece-Hoyes et al., 2005Reece-Hoyes J.S. Deplancke B. Shingles J. Grove C.A. Hope I.A. Walhout A.J.M. A compendium of C. elegans regulatory transcription factors: a resource for mapping transcription regulatory networks.Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R110Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the human genome encodes more than 100 (Simionato et al., 2007Simionato E. Ledent V. Richards G. Thomas-Chollier M. Kerner P. Coornaert D. Degnan B.M. Vervoort M. Origin and diversification of the basic helix-loop-helix gene family in metazoans: insights from comparative genomics.BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The expansion and divergence of TFs has been proposed to lead to increased regulatory complexity, biological specificity and organismal complexity. Paralogous TFs often have different biological functions. For example, loss of C. elegans bHLH TFs results in phenotypes ranging from neuronal defects to embryonic lethality (see e.g., Chen et al., 1994Chen L. Krause M. Sepanski M. Fire A. The Caenorhabditis elegans MYOD homologue HLH-1 is essential for proper muscle function and complete morphogenesis.Development. 1994; 120: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar, Hallam et al., 2000Hallam S.

The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors LIN-32 and HLH-2 function together in multiple steps of a C. elegans neuronal sublineage.Development. 2000; 127: 5415-5426PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, mutations in paralogous TFs can result in different diseases. For instance, mutations in TWIST and HAND1, both bHLH TFs, can result in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and heart hypoplasia, respectively (Howard et al., 1997Howard T.D. Paznekas W.A. Green E.D. Chiang L.C. Ma N. Ortiz de Luna R.I. Garcia Delgado C. Gonzalez-Ramos M. Kline A.D. Jabs E.W. Mutations in TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.Nat.

A loss-of-function mutation in the binding domain of HAND1 predicts hypoplasia of the human hearts.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 1397-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). TFs engage in numerous molecular interactions; they bind DNA and often dimerize with each other (Grove and Walhout, 2008Grove C.A. Walhout A.J. Transcription factor functionality and transcription regulatory networks.Mol. Biosyst. 2008; 4: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, they exhibit specific spatiotemporal expression patterns (Reece-Hoyes et al., 2007Reece-Hoyes J.S. Shingles J. Dupuy D. Grove C.A. Walhout A.J. Vidal M. Hope I.A. Insight into transcription factor gene duplication from Caenorhabditis elegans Promoterome-driven expression patterns.BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Together we refer to such interactions and expression patterns as “TF parameters.” A main challenge in regulatory and genome biology is to understand the mechanisms of TF divergence and to disentangle the contribution of each of the parameters to this process. Specific questions are to what extent members of a TF family differ in each of these parameters, and if differences in any one parameter are more prevalent than differences in another (Figure 1B). Assessment of metazoan TF divergence requires the comprehensive and standardized measurement of multiple TF parameters and the incorporation of these parameters into a single, integrated network. Initial studies in yeast revealed a large degree of redundancy for the eight Yap TFs, as well as functional divergence through DNA binding specificities and interactions with chromatin proteins (Fernandes et al., 1997Fernandes L. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Struhl K. Yap, a novel family of eight bZIP proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with distinct biological functions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6982-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, Tan et al., 2008Tan K. Feizi H. Luo C. Fan S.H. Ravasi T. Ideker T.G.

USA. 2008; 105: 2934-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of divergence in large metazoan TF families remain unexplored (Figure 1B). Numerous metazoan TFs have been studied individually, but the resulting data are sparse due to assay incompleteness and heterogeneity. Therefore, such data could not be used to determine the extent and mechanisms of divergence of complete TF families. Here, we comprehensively determined the dimerization, spatiotemporal expression and DNA binding specificities for nearly all members of the C. elegans bHLH family, and modeled these data into an integrated network (see Figure S1 available with this article online). We systematically compared all the nodes in this network and asked whether they have a high connectivity, i.e. are “promiscuous,” or if they display low connectivity, i.e. are “specific.” Together, these analyses reveal the overall extent of divergence within the C. elegans bHLH family, as well as the relative contribution of each parameter to TF divergence. We first grouped the C. elegans bHLH proteins according to the classes outlined previously, and supplemented by our own data described below (Massari and Murre, 2000Massari M.E. Murre C. Helix-loop-helix proteins: regulators of transcription in eucaryotic organisms.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar; Figure S2).

However, the dimerization partners of the majority of C. elegans bHLH TFs remained unidentified. We performed pair-wise yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays to identify bHLH-bHLH dimers (Walhout et al., 2000Walhout A.J.M. Sordella R. Lu X. Hartley J.L. Temple G.F. Brasch M.A. Thierry-Mieg N. Vidal M. Protein interaction mapping in C. elegans using proteins involved in vulval development.Science. 2000; 287: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). In total, we examined 765 bHLH-bHLH combinations involving 39 bHLH proteins (Table S1). Five bHLH proteins exhibited medium to strong levels of autoactivation (HLH-2, HLH-30, SBP-1, MXL-3, and HIF-1) and could only be tested as prey (Figure 2A). In total, we detected 22 dimers (2 homodimers and 20 heterodimers) involving 26 bHLH proteins (Figures 2B and S3). The complete dimerization network is shown in Figure 2C. We supplemented this network with homodimeric interactions for HLH-25, HLH-27, HLH-29, REF-1, HLH-11, MXL-3, and HLH-30, because we detected their specific DNA binding in protein binding microarray (PBM) and/or yeast one-hybrid assays (Deplancke et al., 2006Deplancke B.

Together, the resulting bHLH network contains 9 homodimers and 21 heterodimers involving 34 proteins. The majority of bHLH proteins exhibit highly specific dimerization as they interact with only a single other bHLH protein (Figure 2C). However, there are two bHLH proteins that interact with multiple other bHLH proteins. The first is AHA-1, the C. elegans Arnt ortholog that dimerizes with all known class VII members (Figure S2). Members of this class contain a PAS domain that mediates protein-protein interactions (Crews, 1998Crews S.T. Control of cell lineage-specific development and transcription by bHLH-PAS proteins.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The second is HLH-2, which binds to 14 other bHLH proteins, many orthologs of which are known to interact with the HLH-2 ortholog in other organisms (interologs, Figure 2D). Taken together, the dimerization network displays both specificity and promiscuity as most bHLH proteins interact with one, but some interact with many other bHLH proteins. To analyze the spatiotemporal expression pattern of bHLH genes, we generated transgenic animals that express the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of bHLH gene promoters (Tables S2 and S3). The earliest GFP expression that we observed was at the ∼24-cell stage with Pcnd-1 and Pngn-1. For five bHLH promoters we did not detect any GFP expression (Table S4). This may be because they are missing distal activating elements, are incorrectly annotated, or are active under conditions that we did not examine (e.g., in dauers or males). We found that some hlh promoters are active broadly, whereas others drive GFP expression in a more restricted fashion (Table S4). The promoters corresponding to both bHLH proteins that dimerize with multiple partners, AHA-1 and HLH-2, confer broad GFP expression, whereas their partners are generally expressed in a more restricted manner. Conversely, some tissues express few bHLH TFs, whereas other tissues express many. For instance, numerous hlh promoters drive expression in the vulva, but only the ref-1 promoter is active in the pharyngeal-intestinal valve. If spatiotemporal expression plays an important role in functional TF divergence, one could expect that proteins that dimerize exhibit greater coexpression than proteins that do not dimerize. To test this, we annotated the spatiotemporal expression of the bHLH gene promoters using a controlled vocabulary and calculated the tissue overlap coefficient (TsOC) (Martinez et al., 2008Martinez N.J. Ow M.C. Reece-Hoyes J. Ambros V. Walhout A.J. Genome-scale spatiotemporal analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans microRNA promoter activity.Genome Res. 2008; 18: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) between all bHLH-bHLH pairs. As expected, dimerization partners are more likely to be coexpressed than bHLH proteins that do not dimerize with each other (Figure 3A, Fisher's exact test p < 0.001). Together, our observations identify specificity and promiscuity in the spatiotemporal expression network, both from the bHLH and from the tissue standpoint (visualized in the integrated network below). We used a dual-reporter approach to determine where and when HLH-2 and each of its partners are coexpressed, because these involve most of the heterodimers we identified. We created a transgenic C. elegans strain that carries a Phlh-2::mCherry::his-11 construct that drives expression of a red fluorescent protein (mCherry) in the nucleus of cells where Phlh-2 is active. Phlh-2 exhibits broad activity in the embryo and its activity becomes more restricted in larvae and adults, consistent with previous HLH-2 immunofluorescence data (Figures 3B and S4 and Table S4; Krause et al., 1997Krause M. Park M. Zhang J.-M. Yuan J. Harfe B.D. Xu S.-Q. Greenwald I. Cole M.D. Paterson B.M. Fire A. A C. elegans E/Daughterless bHLH protein marks neuronal but not striated muscle development.Development. 1997; 124: 2179-2189PubMed Google Scholar). We crossed the Phlh-2::mCherry::his-11 transgenic animals with relevant Phlh::GFP lines (corresponding to HLH-2 partners), resulting in double transgenic animals. When the two hlh promoters are active in the same cell, these cells appear with a green cytoplasm and yellow nucleus in a merged fluorescence image (Figures 3B, 3C, and S4). HLH-2 and most of its partners are first expressed at the comma stage of embryogenesis (Figure S4), which is associated with the onset of cellular differentiation. This is in agreement with observations that orthologs of HLH-2 partners are important regulators of cell lineage commitment and differentiation (Massari and Murre, 2000Massari M.E. Murre C. Helix-loop-helix proteins: regulators of transcription in eucaryotic organisms.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). However, there is some temporal specificity as some HLH-2 dimers are expressed only during embryogenesis and in the first larval stage (e.g., HLH-2/HLH-3) whereas others are expressed throughout the lifetime of the animal (e.g., HLH-2/HLH-8). As has been observed for other organisms, we found that the HLH-2 partners exhibit a more tissue-restricted expression pattern as compared to HLH-2 (Massari and Murre, 2000Massari M.E. Murre C. Helix-loop-helix proteins: regulators of transcription in eucaryotic organisms.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar; Table S4). Posthatching, most HLH-2 heterodimers are expressed only in a subset of tissues, including neurons, the vulva, some hypodermal cells, and distal-tip cells (Figure 3C). In summary, we observed broader, or “tissue-promiscuous,” activity for several bHLH promoters, including those that correspond to the bHLH proteins that interact with multiple partners, and we observed more restricted, or “tissue-restricted,” activity for others. Conversely, we observed that some tissues express many, whereas others express few, bHLH genes. bHLH TFs bind DNA as obligatory homo- or heterodimers and are classically described as recognizing E-box sequences (CANNTG)(Massari and Murre, 2000Massari M.E. Murre C. Helix-loop-helix proteins: regulators of transcription in eucaryotic organisms.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Previously, a handful of DNA sequences that can be bound by seven of the known C. elegans bHLH dimers had been identified (Harfe et al., 1998Harfe B.D. Vaz Gomes A. Kenyon C. Liu J. Krause M. Fire A.

However, in those studies only one or a few of all possible E-boxes were considered, and no experiments were done to determine the comprehensive DNA binding preferences of all C. elegans bHLH dimers. We used PBM assays to comprehensively identify the sequence preferences of the bHLH dimers (Berger et al., 2006Berger M.F. Philippakis A.A. Qureshi A.M. He F.S. Estep 3rd, P.W. Bulyk M.L.

Radhakrishnan M. et al.High-resolution DNA binding specificity analysis of yeast transcription factors.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We first tested each available bHLH TF individually in PBM assays as a GST fusion protein and obtained DNA binding profiles for MXL-3, HLH-1, HLH-11, HLH-25, HLH-26, HLH-27, HLH-29, HLH-30, and REF-1, demonstrating that these proteins can bind DNA without protein partners, presumably as homodimers. Proteins that yielded sequence-specific DNA binding profiles in PBM assays but that were not detected as interacting with any bHLH protein by Y2H assays (e.g., HLH-25) may dimerize in a DNA-dependent manner (Peirano and Wegner, 2000Peirano R.I. Wegner M. The glial transcription factor Sox10 binds to DNA both as a monomer and dimer with different functional consequences.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3047-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Importantly, none of the bHLH proteins that participate in heterodimeric interactions exhibited significant sequence-specific DNA binding on their own (Figures 4A, S5, and S6). To determine the DNA binding profiles of heterodimeric TFs, we incubated the DNA microarrays simultaneously with a GST-fusion bHLH protein that did not bind to DNA on its own, and a FLAG-tagged partner protein with subsequent detection using a fluorophore-conjugated anti-GST antibody. We examined each of the bHLH heterodimers identified by our Y2H screen in this manner. We obtained DNA binding profiles for nine homodimers and ten heterodimers, including most heterodimers involving HLH-2, two class IV dimers, and five out of six REF-1 family proteins (Class VI) (Figures S7 and S8, see below). We did not detect any sequence-specific DNA binding by the bHLH-PAS class of dimers, even though these readily form heterodimers in the Y2H system. It is possible that sequence-specific DNA binding by members of this class requires ligands or post-translational modifications (Crews, 1998Crews S.T. Control of cell lineage-specific development and transcription by bHLH-PAS proteins.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The PBM-derived 8-mer data span the full affinity range of DNA binding preferences (Berger et al., 2006Berger M.F. Philippakis A.A. Qureshi A.M. He F.S. Estep 3rd, P.W. Bulyk M.L. Compact, universal DNA microarrays to comprehensively determine transcription-factor binding site specificities.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1429-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). We calculated enrichment scores (ESs) from the PBM signal intensities for all possible 8-mers, and for each bHLH dimer that yielded sequence-specific DNA binding, and derived position weight matrices (PWMs) for each dimer (Table S5 and Figure S8). We imposed a conservative threshold (ES ≥ 0.40) to identify significantly bound 8-mers. We then hierarchically clustered both the dimers and the 8-mers and found that the bHLH proteins can be grouped into two clusters corresponding to different bHLH classes (Figure S2): Cluster I contains HLH-2 and its partners, HLH-1 and HLH-11, and cluster II contains class III, IV, and VI bHLH proteins (Figure 4B). As expected, HLH-2-containing dimers (cluster I) exhibit a strong preference for E-box sequences (CANNTG) (Massari and Murre, 2000Massari M.E. Murre C. Helix-loop-helix proteins: regulators of transcription in eucaryotic organisms.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, cluster II dimers, in addition to binding a few E-boxes, also bind multiple non-E-box sequences. These resemble E-boxes, but contain a C or A in the fifth position and a G or T in the sixth position of the binding site (CAYRMK). These “E-box-like sequences” include the reported CACGCG binding site of Drosophila Hairy, and N-boxes (CACNAG), which are bound by Drosophila Enhancer of Split (Davis and Turner, 2001Davis R.L. Turner D.L. Vertebrate hairy and Enhancer of split related proteins: transcriptional repressors regulating cellular differentiation and embryonic patterning.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8342-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We determined the statistical significance of the preference of each bHLH dimer for E-box and E-box-like sequences as compared to all other 8-mers (Figure S7). As shown in Figure 4A, neither HLH-2 nor HLH-10 alone can bind significantly to any E-box or E-box-like sequence. However, when combined, they can bind five different sequences. Figure 4C shows that the bHLH DNA binding network also displays degrees of specificity and promiscuity. For instance, only HLH-1 homodimers can bind CAA-containing E-boxes (Figure S7). Some E-boxes and E-box-like sequences are preferred by relatively few dimers, whereas others are bound by many dimers. For example, CACATG is bound by only four dimers, but CACCTG is bound by ten distinct dimers. Conversely, some bHLH dimers bind few E-boxes or E-box-like sequences whereas others bind many: HLH-30 binds only CACGTG, but HLH-2/HLH-10 binds five different E-boxes (Figure 4C). This demonstrates that there is specificity and promiscuity in the bHLH DNA binding network, both from the view of the proteins and at the level of their DNA binding sequences. The PBM ES of a particular DNA sequence bound by a dimer is a reflection of relative DNA binding affinities (Berger et al., 2006Berger M.F. Philippakis A.A. Qureshi A.M. He F.S. Estep 3rd, P.W. Bulyk M.L. Compact, universal DNA microarrays to comprehensively determine transcription-factor binding site specificities.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1429-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). We noticed that the ES distribution for 8-mers corresponding to a particular dimer/sequence combination varied greatly. For instance, both HLH-26 and MDL-1/MXL-1 bind CACGTG E-boxes, but HLH-26 does so with a broad ES range and MDL-1/MXL-1 with a very narrow ES range (Figure 4D). This suggests that, in contrast to MDL-1/MXL-1, not all CACGTG E-boxes are bound equally well by HLH-26. We considered the possibility that differences may be due to effects of nucleotides flanking the core CACGTG E-box. Indeed, flanking nucleotides have been reported previously to contribute to bHLH dimer DNA binding (Fisher and Goding, 1992Fisher F. Goding C.R. Single amino acid substitutions alter helix-loop-helix protein specificity for bases flanking the core CANNTG motif.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, Walhout et al., 1998Walhout A.J.M. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T.M. Sequences flanking the E-box contribute to cooperative binding by c-Myc/Max heterodimers to adjacent binding sites.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 189-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effects of nucleotides flanking the E-box and E-box-like sequences had not been analyzed systematically for most bHLH TFs. Since each bHLH monomer may directly contact the flanking nucleotide immediately 5′ of the E-box (Ellenberger et al., 1994Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C.

We found that for the MDL-1/MXL-1 dimer each of the four possible nucleotides flanking the CACGTG core sequence is recognized approximately equally well; the ES for each relevant 8-mer is between 0.49 and 0.50 (Figure 4E). However, HLH-26 exhibits a strong preference for a 5′ A or G (median 8-mer ES > 0.40), and disfavors a 5′ T (median 8-mer ES < 0.10) and, to a lesser"

Unexpectedly, we noted Par-4 protein is spontaneously secreted by normal and cancer cells in culture, and by Par-4 transgenic mice that are resistant to spontaneous tumors. Short exposure to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducing agents further increased cellular secretion of Par-4 by a brefeldin A-sensitive pathway. Secretion occurred independently of caspase activation and apoptosis. Interestingly, extracellular Par-4 induced apoptosis by binding to the stress response protein, glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78), expressed at the surface of cancer cells. The interaction of extracellular Par-4 and cell surface GRP78 led to apoptosis via ER stress and activation of the FADD/caspase-8/caspase-3 pathway. Moreover, apoptosis inducible by TRAIL, which also exerts cancer cell-specific effects, is dependent on extracellular Par-4 signaling via cell surface GRP78. Thus, Par-4 activates an extrinsic pathway involving cell surface GRP78 receptor for induction of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2045202254,"Although endocytosis maintains synaptic transmission, how endocytosis is initiated is unclear. We found that calcium influx initiated all forms of endocytosis at a single nerve terminal in rodents, including clathrin-dependent slow endocytosis, bulk endocytosis, rapid endocytosis and endocytosis overshoot (excess endocytosis), with each being evoked with a correspondingly higher calcium threshold. As calcium influx increased, endocytosis gradually switched from very slow endocytosis to slow endocytosis to bulk endocytosis to rapid endocytosis and to endocytosis overshoot. The calcium-induced endocytosis rate increase was a result of the speeding up of membrane invagination and fission. Pharmacological experiments suggested that the calcium sensor mediating these forms of endocytosis is calmodulin. In addition to its role in recycling vesicles, calcium/calmodulin-initiated endocytosis facilitated vesicle mobilization to the readily releasable pool, probably by clearing fused vesicle membrane at release sites. Our findings provide a unifying mechanism for the initiation of various forms of endocytosis that are critical in maintaining exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2064539804,"Intrinsic immune responses autonomously inhibit viral replication and spread. One pathway that restricts viral infection in plants and insects is RNA interference (RNAi), which targets and degrades viral RNA to limit infection. To identify additional genes involved in intrinsic antiviral immunity, we screened Drosophila cells for modulators of viral infection using an RNAi library. We identified Ars2 as a key component of Drosophila antiviral immunity. Loss of Ars2 in cells, or in flies, increases susceptibility to RNA viruses. Consistent with its antiviral properties, we found that Ars2 physically interacts with Dcr-2, modulates its activity in vitro, and is required for siRNA-mediated silencing. Furthermore, we show that Ars2 plays an essential role in miRNA-mediated silencing, interacting with the Microprocessor and stabilizing pri-miRNAs. The identification of Ars2 as a player in these small RNA pathways provides new insight into the biogenesis of small RNAs that may be extended to other systems."

https://openalex.org/W1980092395,"Vascular permeability is a complex process involving the coordinated regulation of multiple signaling pathways in the endothelial cell. It has long been documented that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) greatly enhances microvascular permeability; however, the molecular mechanisms controlling VEGF-induced permeability remain unknown. Treatment of microvascular endothelial cells with VEGF led to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS are required for VEGF-induced permeability as treatment with the free radical scavenger, N-acetylcysteine, inhibited this effect. Additionally, treatment with VEGF caused ROS-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of both vascular-endothelial (VE)-cadherin and beta-catenin. Rac1 was required for the VEGF-induced increase in permeability and adherens junction protein phosphorylation. Knockdown of Rac1 inhibited VEGF-induced ROS production consistent with Rac lying upstream of ROS in this pathway. Collectively, these data suggest that VEGF leads to a Rac-mediated generation of ROS, which, in turn, elevates the tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and beta-catenin, ultimately regulating adherens junction integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1973181654,"Here we identify a component of the nuclear RNA cap-binding complex (CBC), Ars2, that is important for miRNA biogenesis and critical for cell proliferation. Unlike other components of the CBC, Ars2 expression is linked to the proliferative state of the cell. Deletion of Ars2 is developmentally lethal, and deletion in adult mice led to bone marrow failure whereas parenchymal organs composed of nonproliferating cells were unaffected. Depletion of Ars2 or CBP80 from proliferating cells impaired miRNA-mediated repression and led to alterations in primary miRNA processing in the nucleus. Ars2 depletion also reduced the levels of several miRNAs, including miR-21, let-7, and miR-155, that are implicated in cellular transformation. These findings provide evidence for a role for Ars2 in RNA interference regulation during cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2015924792,"Progressive telomere attrition or uncapping of the shelterin complex elicits a DNA damage response as a result of a cell's inability to distinguish dysfunctional telomeric ends from DNA double-strand breaks. Telomere deprotection activates both ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase-dependent DNA damage response pathways, and promotes efficient non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) of dysfunctional telomeres. The mammalian MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN; NBS1 is also known as NBN) complex interacts with ATM to sense chromosomal double-strand breaks and coordinate global DNA damage responses. Although the MRN complex accumulates at dysfunctional telomeres, it is not known whether mammalian MRN promotes repair at these sites. Here we address this question by using mouse alleles that either inactivate the entire MRN complex or eliminate only the nuclease activities of MRE11 (ref. 8). We show that cells lacking MRN do not activate ATM when telomeric repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2) is removed from telomeres, and ligase 4 (LIG4)-dependent chromosome end-to-end fusions are markedly reduced. Residual chromatid fusions involve only telomeres generated by leading strand synthesis. Notably, although cells deficient for MRE11 nuclease activity efficiently activate ATM and recruit 53BP1 (also known as TP53BP1) to deprotected telomeres, the 3' telomeric overhang persists to prevent NHEJ-mediated chromosomal fusions. Removal of shelterin proteins that protect the 3' overhang in the setting of MRE11 nuclease deficiency restores LIG4-dependent chromosome fusions. Our data indicate a critical role for the MRN complex in sensing dysfunctional telomeres, and show that in the absence of TRF2, MRE11 nuclease activity removes the 3' telomeric overhang to promote chromosome fusions. MRE11 can also protect newly replicated leading strand telomeres from NHEJ by promoting 5' strand resection to generate POT1a-TPP1-bound 3' overhangs."
https://openalex.org/W2039648381,"The long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a multifunctional soluble pattern recognition molecule that is crucial in innate immune protection against opportunistic fungal pathogens such as Aspergillus fumigatus. The mechanisms that mediate downstream effects of PTX3 are largely unknown. However, PTX3 interacts with C1q from the classical pathway of the complement. The ficolins are recognition molecules of the lectin complement pathway sharing structural and functional characteristics with C1q. Thus, we investigated whether the ficolins (Ficolin-1, -2, and -3) interact with PTX3 and whether the complexes are able to modulate complement activation on A. fumigatus. Ficolin-2 could be affinity-isolated from human plasma on immobilized PTX3. In binding studies, Ficolin-1 and particularly Ficolin-2 interacted with PTX3 in a calcium-independent manner. Ficolin-2, but not Ficolin-1 and Ficolin-3, bound A. fumigatus directly, but this binding was enhanced by PTX3 and vice versa. Ficolin-2-dependent complement deposition on the surface of A. fumigatus was enhanced by PTX3. A polymorphism in the FCN2 gene causing a T236M amino acid change in the fibrinogen-like binding domain of Ficolin-2, which affects the binding to GlcNAc, reduced Ficolin-2 binding to PTX3 and A. fumigatus significantly. These results demonstrate that PTX3 and Ficolin-2 may recruit each other on pathogens. The effect was alleviated by a common amino acid change in the fibrinogen-like domain of Ficolin-2. Thus, components of the humoral innate immune system, which activate different complement pathways, cooperate and amplify microbial recognition and effector functions."

However, the mechanisms controlling such specific lineage engagement divisions remain elusive. Several cellular regulators have been identified that can either promote or restrict HSC cycling, but their mutation in genetic models exclusively affected self-renewal (Orford and Scadden, 2008Orford K.W.

By contrast, regulators that selectively control lineage-specific commitment divisions of HSCs have not been identified. In this context, the importance of both transcription factor and cytokine signaling for lineage engagement has been invoked (Metcalf, 2007Metcalf D.

Transcription factors with effects on stem cell cycling so far were exclusively found to affect self-renewal divisions (Orford and Scadden, 2008Orford K.W. Scadden D.T.

Hematopoietic cytokines.Blood. 2008; 111: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) have been interpreted as a permissive role of cytokine signaling in lineage engagement. On the other hand, examples have been reported where ectopic cytokine signals resulted in lineage conversion and thus supported an instructive model (Kondo et al., 2000Kondo M. Scherer D.C.

Furthermore, MafB-deficient macrophages show increased responsiveness to M-CSF-induced morphological changes (Aziz et al., 2006Aziz A. Vanhille L. Mohideen P. Kelly L.M. Otto C. Bakri Y. Mossadegh N. Sarrazin S. Sieweke M.H. Development of macrophages with altered actin organization in the absence of MafB.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6808-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). M-CSF has been mainly characterized for its lineage-specific effects on monocytes and macrophages (Pixley and Stanley, 2004Pixley F.J. Stanley E.R. CSF-1 regulation of the wandering macrophage: complexity in action.Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 628-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), but earlier work also suggested that M-CSF can act on primitive stem and precursor cell populations (Kriegler et al., 1994Kriegler A.B. Verschoor S.M. Bernardo D. Bertoncello I. The relationship between different high proliferative potential colony-forming cells in mouse bone marrow.Exp. Hematol. 1994; 22: 432-440PubMed Google Scholar), which upon more detailed characterization were also found to express its receptor (Akashi et al., 2003Akashi K. He X. Chen J. Iwasaki H. Niu C. Steenhard B. Zhang J. Haug J. Li L.

Cell. 2002; 3: 137-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Here, we report that MafB deficiency specifically sensitized HSC populations to M-CSF-induced cell division, specific upregulation of the early myeloid selector gene PU.1, and a dramatically enhanced myeloid-specific repopulation activity that does not affect self-renewal or differentiation into other lineages. Our results point to a role for MafB in the maintenance of a balanced lineage potential of HSCs by selectively restricting myeloid commitment divisions that give rise to PU.1+ progenitors in response to M-CSF signaling. Together, these data suggest that the potential of stem cells to produce differentiated progeny of a specific lineage bias can be subject to control by integrated cytokine/transcription factor circuits, where variation in cell-intrinsic sensitivity limits like those set by MafB can render external cues such as M-CSF instructive. Hematopoietic transcription factors with established roles in mature myeloid cells can have important functions in HSCs (Iwasaki and Akashi, 2007Iwasaki H. Akashi K.

Intrinsic and extrinsic control of haematopoietic stem-cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Here, we found significant expression of the monocyte/macrophage transcription factor MafB in the highly LT-HSC-enriched CD34−Flt3/Flk2− population of the primitive c-kit+,sca+,lin− (KSL) bone marrow fraction but not in downstream progenitors such as in Flt3+KSL multipotent progenitors (MPPs) or in committed common myeloid (CMPs) and granulocyte macrophage (GMPs) progenitors (Figures S1A and S1B available online). Since MafB can influence cellular proliferation in other systems and cell-cycle status is an important determinant of stem cell activity, we further investigated the effect of MafB deficiency on HSC proliferation. Cell-cycle analysis consistently revealed an increased rate of cell division for MafB−/− cells in highly LT-HSC-enriched populations as defined by two different stringent marker combinations (CD150+ or CD34− cells in the Flt3− KSL [KSLF] fraction) but not in other KSL fractions (Figures 1A, 1B, S1C, and S1D). When we further analyzed the consequence of increased HSC proliferation on stem cell activity in competitive reconstitution assays, we observed a significant advantage of MafB−/− but not WT HSCs over normal competitors that resulted in an increased contribution of MafB−/− cells to the KSL fraction (Figure 1C). Surprisingly, this competitive advantage of MafB−/− HSCs differentially affected the repopulation of lymphomyeloid progeny and resulted in striking differences in the contribution to the different lineages of the hematopoietic system. Twelve weeks after reconstitution, myeloid Mac1+ cells in spleen and bone marrow were largely derived from MafB−/− donor cells with a 3-fold and 11-fold excess over WT competitors, respectively (Figure 1D). This competitive advantage was maintained long term in the KSL fraction (Figures S2A and SB) and in mature myeloid cells, including F4/80+ macrophages (Figure 1D). Interestingly, however, the repopulation advantage was lineage specific and not observed in lymphoid or erythroid cells. In peripheral lymphoid organs or bone marrow, the original ratio of donor to competitor was maintained in T cells and only slightly increased in B cells (Figure 1D). Since erythroid cells only weakly express the Ly5 surface marker, we analyzed MafB−/− donor contribution to Ter119+ erythroid cells in the bone marrow by quantitative genomic PCR. Quantitative PCR of nonfunctional GFP sequences that specifically tag the MafB knockout allele (Blanchi et al., 2003Blanchi B. Kelly L.M. Viemari J.C. Lafon I. Burnet H. Bevengut M. Tillmanns S. Daniel L. Graf T. Hilaire G. et al.MafB deficiency causes defective respiratory rhythmogenesis and fatal central apnea at birth.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1091-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) revealed a linear standard curve for defined mixtures of WT and MafB−/− cells (Figures 1E and 1F) and a consistent advantage of MafB−/− donor cell contribution to Mac-1+ cells but a contribution to the erythroid lineage that reflected the original injected donor to competitor ratio (Figure 1G). Despite this strong myeloid-biased repopulation advantage, we did not observe an abnormal increase of total KSL (Figures S2C and S2D) or myeloid cells, myeloproliferative disorders, or leukemia (Figure S3), indicating that MafB−/− HSCs outcompeted WT cells in the generation of myeloid progeny without transgressing compartment limits. To further define the efficiency and kinetics of the myeloid specific repopulation advantage, we followed the contribution of MafB−/− HSCs to blood leukocytes of mice reconstituted in excess of competitor cells. Whereas at all dilutions MafB−/− stem cells continued to stably contribute to T cells at the initially injected ratio over the whole observation period, we observed a progressively increasing contribution of MafB−/− Ly5.2 but not WT Ly5.2 cells to myeloid Mac-1-positive leukocytes even at a 10-fold or 50-fold excess of competitor cells (Figure 2A). This became first observable between 4 and 6 weeks after reconstitution, when originally coinjected progenitors have exhausted their life span and peripheral blood cells will be mainly derived from donor stem cells. At 15 weeks after reconstitution with equal initial input, MafB−/− cells had almost entirely outcompeted the WT cells, and in the case of a 10-fold initial competitor excess still provided most cells in the Mac-1-positive population. Strikingly, even at the initial ratio of 1/50, which corresponded to the arithmetic equivalent of ∼0.2 to 0.6 MafB−/− LT-HSCs (assuming a LT-HSC frequency of 1–3/100,000 cells; Bryder et al., 2006Bryder D. Rossi D.J. Weissman I.L. Hematopoietic stem cells: the paradigmatic tissue-specific stem cell.Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 338-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), one out of four injected mice showed a progressive and principally MafB−/− contribution to the myeloid compartment by 15 weeks after reconstitution, whereas the three other mice had no Ly5.2 contribution. Together, these results indicated that even at a vast excess of competitor cells, few, possibly a single, MafB−/− stem cells could rapidly and progressively outcompete normal cells in the repopulation of the myeloid compartment but continued to contribute faithfully at original ratios to the development of T cells. Increased proliferative potential of HSCs is frequently associated with stem cell exhaustion and eventual hematopoietic failure of bone marrow transplants (Orford and Scadden, 2008Orford K.W. Scadden D.T. Deconstructing stem cell self-renewal: genetic insights into cell-cycle regulation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). To determine whether this was the case for MafB−/− HSCs, we investigated whether a myeloid selective repopulation advantage could be sustained through serial transplantations. As shown in Figure 2B, serial bone marrow transfer from mice originally reconstituted with a 10-fold excess of competitor cells into secondary and tertiary hosts resulted in continued lymphohematopoietic reconstitution for a cumulative period of over one year and a progressively increasing contribution of MafB−/− HSCs to the myeloid compartment. By contrast, MafB−/− HSCs continued to faithfully contribute to the T cell lineage at the originally injected ratio. Furthermore, self-renewal was not abnormally increased, as serial transplantation did not affect the total number of KSL cells in the bone marrow (Figure S5). Repeated transfer of CFU-S12 colonies from competitive WT or MafB−/− reconstitutions also showed complete hematopoietic failure and death of recipients after the fifth transplantation (Figure 2C), as expected from previous reports (Siminovitch et al., 1964Siminovitch L. Till J.E. McCulloch E.A. Decline in colony-forming ability of marrow cells Subjected to Serial Transplantation into Irradiated Mice.J. Cell. Physiol. 1964; 64: 23-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our results indicate that MafB−/− HSCs neither abnormally exhaust nor increase their self-renewal capacity, continue to contribute to all lineages, and sustain a progressively increasing myeloid repopulation advantage through serial transplantation. We next investigated whether the myeloid-specific repopulation advantage of MafB−/− HSCs was cell intrinsic and was reflected in increased generation of myeloid progeny in culture. Toward this end, we cultured sorted KSL cells under myeloid differentiation conditions in SCF, TPO, and M-CSF (Iwama et al., 2004Iwama A. Oguro H. Negishi M. Kato Y. Morita Y. Tsukui H. Ema H. Kamijo T. Katoh-Fukui Y. Koseki H. et al.Enhanced self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells mediated by the polycomb gene product Bmi-1.Immunity. 2004; 21: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) or in the presence of Flt-3 ligand and Il-7 on OP9-DL1 cells, which support T cell differentiation from HSC populations (Schmitt and Zuniga-Pflucker, 2002Schmitt T.M. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Induction of T cell development from hematopoietic progenitor cells by delta-like-1 in vitro.Immunity. 2002; 17: 749-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Cell counts at 24 hr intervals revealed that after 4.5 days under myeloid conditions, MafB−/− cells had generated significantly more progeny cells than their WT counterparts (Figure 3A). By contrast, MafB−/− cells showed no difference from WT cells under lymphoid differentiation conditions (Figure 3B). Notably, the increased cell production under myeloid conditions did not prevent differentiation or change the final phenotype of differentiated cells, as judged by a similar Mac-1/Gr-1 or CD25/CD44 expression profile after 5 days of myeloid or T cell differentiation conditions, respectively (Figures 3A and 3B). Furthermore, increased generation of myeloid progeny from MafB−/− KSL cells depended on an increased response to myeloid conditions during the initial culture period (Figure 3C), whereas myeloid-committed CMPs responded well but showed no difference between WT and MafB−/− samples (Figure 3D). Consistent with this and in contrast to KSL cell controls, purified sca−, ckit+ progenitors that include CMP also couldn't initiate a myeloid specific repopulation advantage in vivo (Figure S6). Together, these observations indicated that the increased proliferation and myeloid specific repopulation advantage of MafB−/− HSCs corresponded to an intrinsic capacity to specifically generate more myeloid progeny in culture. The ability of MafB−/− KSL cells to generate more myeloid progeny was only observed in the presence but not in the absence of M-CSF (Figure 3C). Furthermore, other myeloid cytokines such as GM-CSF, Il-3, and G-CSF or FGF, a cytokine with profound effects on HSCs (Zhang and Lodish, 2008Zhang C.C. Lodish H.F. Cytokines regulating hematopoietic stem cell function.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2008; 15: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) that acts through a similar receptor tyrosine kinase as M-CSF, also had no differential effect (Figure 3E). When we further investigated this M-CSF response in vivo by cell-cycle analysis 16 hr after direct injection of recombinant M-CSF into the blood stream of WT or MafB−/− reconstituted mice, we also observed a significant increase in the cycling fraction of MafB−/− KSL cells but not of c-kit+sca− progenitors (Figures 3F and 3G). This enhanced M-CSF-specific response could depend on increased M-CSF receptor (M-CSFR) expression, increased cellular sensitivity to M-CSFR signaling, or both. Although we observed a small increase of M-CSFR message levels both in total KSL and HSC-enriched KSLF cells (Figures S7A and S7B), this effect appeared to be too small to account for the observed phenotype and may simply occur as a secondary effect of higher sensitivity to receptor signaling, since the expression of M-CSFR is under positive feedback control from its own signals (Xie et al., 2001Xie Y. Chen C. Hume D.A. Transcriptional regulation of c-fms gene expression.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 34: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To uncouple M-CSFR signaling from regulation of its promoter, we therefore infected WT or MafB−/− cyclophosphamide-mobilized stem/precursor cells with a td-tomato retrovirus expressing a constitutively active form of M-CSFR (M-CSFR∗), whose signaling and expression is independent of exogenous M-CSF (Carlberg and Rohrschneider, 1994Carlberg K. Rohrschneider L. The effect of activating mutations on dimerization, tyrosine phosphorylation and internalization of the macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After 36 hr in culture, we observed a significant increase of cycling cells (S/G2/M) in M-CSFR∗ over control virus infected MafB−/− KSL cells but not in WT KSL cells or in the uninfected td-tomato− population (Figures 4A and 4B). To further test whether conversely, ectopic MafB expression could specifically restrict M-CSFR dependent myeloid divisions under conditions of uncoupled receptor expression and signaling, we used a conditionally transformed T lymphoid cell line that ectopically expresses M-CSFR from a heterologous, M-CSF-independent promoter and does not express endogenous MafB or M-CSFR (EGER-fms; Bourette et al., 2007Bourette R.P. Grasset M.F. Mouchiroud G. E2a/Pbx1 oncogene inhibits terminal differentiation but not myeloid potential of pro-T cells.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). After infection with a MafB-GFP or GFP control retrovirus, we cultured this cell line alternatively under myeloid or lymphoid conditions in M-CSF or Il-7/SCF, respectively. BrdU incorporation and cell-cycle analysis revealed that MafB almost completely inhibited M-CSF-dependent cell division, but had no effect on cell-cycle progression under lymphoid conditions (Figures 4C and 4D). Thus, both gain- and loss-of-function experiments in multipotent cells revealed that MafB can selectively limit sensitivity to M-CSFR signaling. To further test whether increased sensitivity to endogenous M-CSF signaling was at the basis of the myeloid-specific repopulation advantage of MafB−/− HSCs in vivo, we generated a GFP retrovirus expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against the M-CSFR (shFms), which was highly effective in reducing its surface expression (Figure 4E). We infected MafB−/− Ly5.2 fetal liver cells with shFms virus, injected them together with F1 competitor cells into lethally irradiated Ly5.1 recipients, and analyzed the effect on competitive repopulation in the spleen, where a myeloid-specific advantage of MafB−/− HSCs could already be detected 12 days after reconstitution (Figure S8). Comparison of GFP+ and GFP− populations in the Mac-1+ and Mac-1− fraction of shFms virus-infected donor cells revealed that reduction of M-CSFR levels decreased the myeloid-specific repopulation advantage of MafB−/− cells (Figure 4F), whereas a control virus had no such effect (data not shown)."

Given its critical nature, a phase III human CSP malaria vaccine trial is ongoing. The CSP is composed of three regions as follows: an N terminus that binds heparin sulfate proteoglycans, a four amino acid repeat region (NANP), and a C terminus that contains a thrombospondin-like type I repeat (TSR) domain. Despite the importance of CSP, little is known about its structure. Therefore, recombinant forms of CSP were produced by expression in both Escherichia coli (Ec) and then refolded (EcCSP) or in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (PpCSP) for structural analyses. To analyze the TSR domain of recombinant CSP, conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies that recognized unfixed P. falciparum sporozoites and inhibited sporozoite invasion of HepG2 cells in vitro were identified. These monoclonal antibodies recognized all recombinant CSPs, indicating the recombinant CSPs contain a properly folded TSR domain structure. Characterization of both EcCSP and PpCSP by dynamic light scattering and velocity sedimentation demonstrated that both forms of CSP appeared as highly extended proteins (Rh 4.2 and 4.58 nm, respectively). Furthermore, high resolution atomic force microscopy revealed flexible, rod-like structures with a ribbon-like appearance. Using this information, we modeled the NANP repeat and TSR domain of CSP. Consistent with the biochemical and biophysical results, the repeat region formed a rod-like structure about 21–25 nm in length and 1.5 nm in width.

Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is a serious global health issue, resulting in an estimated 1.5 million deaths annually, primarily among infants and young children. Ongoing multifaceted global intervention strategies to control malaria include drug treatment, insecticide usage, bed-net use, and vaccine development. However, parasite and mosquito control measures have met with limited success resulting from an increased drug and insecticide resistance within the Plasmodia and mosquito populations, respectively. Vaccine development represents an encouraging approach given that previous animal and human studies using irradiated sporozoites demonstrated the feasibility of producing an efficacious vaccine (1Clyde D.F.

Although the exact immunologic correlates of protection remain elusive, an abundance of evidence indicates that protection against liver stage parasites is complex, involving multiple immune mechanisms (4Franke E.D.

To date, the majority of the pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine development has focused on the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), 2The abbreviations used are: CSPcircumsporozoite proteinTSRthrombospondin-like type I repeatmAbmonoclonal antibodyISIinhibition of sporozoite invasionECMEagle's essential minimum complete mediaDTTdithiothreitolBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolPBSphosphate-buffered salineSEC-MALS-QELS-HPLCsize exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering-quasi-elastic light scatter detection; high pressure liquid chromatographyqRTquantitative real timerrecombinantAFMatomic force microscopyEcCSPE. coli CSPPpCSPP. pastoris CSPESI-MSelectrospray ionization-mass spectrometry-MLmechanical microfluidization lysis-CLchemical detergent lysis. 2The abbreviations used are: CSPcircumsporozoite proteinTSRthrombospondin-like type I repeatmAbmonoclonal antibodyISIinhibition of sporozoite invasionECMEagle's essential minimum complete mediaDTTdithiothreitolBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolPBSphosphate-buffered salineSEC-MALS-QELS-HPLCsize exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering-quasi-elastic light scatter detection; high pressure liquid chromatographyqRTquantitative real timerrecombinantAFMatomic force microscopyEcCSPE. coli CSPPpCSPP. pastoris CSPESI-MSelectrospray ionization-mass spectrometry-MLmechanical microfluidization lysis-CLchemical detergent lysis. the predominant surface antigen on sporozoites. CSP can be segmented into three regions as follows: the N-terminal region containing region I; the central repeat region; and the C-terminal region containing the thrombospondin-like type I repeat (TSR). Initial CSP vaccine development focused on the central repeat region that contains the immunodominant B cell epitope (12Herrington D.A. Clyde D.F. Losonsky G. Cortesia M. Murphy J.R. Davis J. Baqar S. Felix A.M. Heimer E.P. Gillessen D. et al.Nature. 1987; 328: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). However, vaccine constructs quickly evolved to incorporate both the central repeat region containing the B cell epitopes and the C terminus containing the TSR domain, T cell epitopes, and B cell epitopes (13Nardin E.H. Oliveira G.A. Calvo-Calle J.M. Castro Z.R. Nussenzweig R.S. Schmeckpeper B. Hall B.F. Diggs C. Bodison S. Edelman R. J. Infect.

Currently, the most advanced and moderately effective malaria vaccine, RTS,S, is composed of a portion of the central repeat and the C-terminal regions linked to the hepatitis B surface antigen (15Bejon P.

However, recent studies have highlighted the physiological importance of the N-terminal region (16Ancsin J.B. Kisilevsky R. J. Biol.

Moreover, this epitope was not only found to be immunogenic but the resulting antibodies were determined to be inhibitory in a sporozoite invasion assay (18Rathore D. Nagarkatti R. Jani D.

To better understand the structure of CSP and to produce good quality recombinant protein for human vaccine-directed studies, we generated full-length and near full-length recombinant CSP. We examined two expression systems, Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, to determine their feasibility to generate CSP. To assist the characterization of the rCSPs, we generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that were characterized biologically prior to being used to examine the rCSPs. Additionally, each of the rCSP molecules was extensively biochemically and biophysically characterized. The results collated together have enabled the molecular modeling of CSP as a long flexible, rod-like protein. To generate antibodies toward CSP, we utilized a Saccharomyces cerevisiae-expressing CSP (ScCSP) clone generated by David Kaslow. 3D. Kaslow, unpublished data. The 3D7 DNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number XM_001351086) corresponding to CSP amino acids Phe20 to Ser384 was cloned into the Saccharomyces expression vector YEpRPEU3 using the cloning sites NheI and ApaI. The resulting transcribed gene contained a His6 tag. The sequence of CSP was verified prior to fermentation. Fermentation material was produced as described previously (20Stowers A.W. Zhang Y. Shimp R.L. Kaslow D.C. Yeast. 2001; 18: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and purified using a two-step purification scheme: nickel affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography. Purified ScCSP was supplied to A&G Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Columbia, MD) to generate a panel of mAbs. Mice were boosted twice with a fragment ScCSP with an N-terminal sequence beginning at amino acid Ser301 (GenBankTM accession number XM_001351086). Hybridoma supernatants were screened by Western blot against sporozoite lysates and confocal microscopy of live sporozoites. Antibodies determined to be reduction-sensitive were isotyped and subclassed using the Thermo Scientific Pierce rapid isotyping kit per the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To ascertain whether or not the mAbs generated toward the ScCSP had biological significance, they were examined using an in vitro assay to determine their ability to inhibit sporozoite invasion of HepG2 cells. In brief, analysis of the invasion of HepG2 clone A16 cells (21Hollingdale M.R. Leland P. Schwartz A.L. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1983; 32: 682-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) by P. falciparum sporozoites (strain NF54) in the presence or absence of test anti-CSP IgG was performed using qRT-PCR to determine the percent invasion of the HepG2 cells. The details for the ISI assay are provided below. Each well of a 48-well plate (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) was coated with ECL cell attachment matrix (catalog number 08-110, Millipore, Billerica, MA) in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 1 h. This ECL solution was aspirated immediately prior to adding the HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were maintained in Eagle's essential minimum complete media (ECM), Eagle's essential minimum media (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1% 100× l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 units/ml) (Invitrogen). In preparation for seeding, HepG2 cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in ECM to a final concentration of 300,000 cells/ml. After aspiration of ECL solution, 300 μl of the HepG2 cell suspension was added to each well and incubated overnight at 37 °C. P. falciparum sporozoites (strain NF54) were grown in Anopheles stephensi adult female mosquitoes until harvest. Mosquitoes were collected in a cylindrical chamber, placed at −20 °C for 5–10 min, and soaked in 70% ethanol. They were then serially washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing penicillin/streptomycin plus antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen) and ECM. Each mosquito was dissected by separating the head from the thorax and removing the salivary glands from the head and/or thorax. The salivary glands were stored in ECM at room temperature until use. After all mosquitoes were dissected, the salivary glands were pooled and disrupted by passing through a 28½-gauge needle. The sporozoites released from the salivary glands were counted and diluted in ECM to a final concentration of 500,000 sporozoites/ml. Each serum sample to be tested was diluted in ECM to 2× the desired final concentration. The anti-sporozoite (CSP) antibody, navy falciparum sporozoite antibody 1 (NFS1) (developed by immunizing mice with whole sporozoites), used as a positive control, was diluted to a concentration of 200 μg/ml. For each well, 55 μl of the test or control serum was mixed with 55 μl of the sporozoite suspension and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Old medium was aspirated, and then 100 μl of each sporozoite/serum mixture was added to each well and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. After the 3-h invasion incubation, each well was washed twice with fresh ECM and incubated overnight (15–21 h) at 37 °C. To generate a standard curve for the qRT-PCR, sporozoites were serially diluted in ECM (4,860 to 20 sporozoites), added to HepG2 monolayers. Total host-cell/parasite material was collected and stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction. Following an overnight incubation at 37 °C, HepG2 cells were washed at room temperature, trypsinized at 37 °C, and transferred to an RNase-free microcentrifuge tube. Free sporozoites were removed by twice pelleting the host cells at 1500 rpm for 2 min. The pellet was stored at −80 °C or used directly for RNA extraction. RNA was extracted and isolated from host cell/parasite material using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and RNA quality was assessed in a GeneQuant Pro DNA/RNA calculator (GE Healthcare) using quartz capillaries (GE Healthcare). Only RNA with an A260/280 ratio greater than 1.9 was used in further experiments. RNA was uniformly diluted to <100 ng/ml, added to PCR plates, and then transcribed to cDNA using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Reaction volumes of 20 μl were used in a Thermal Cycler (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA) set at the following amplification cycle: 25 °C for 10 min; 37 °C for 120 min; 85 °C for 5 s; hold at 4 °C. The resulting cDNA was used immediately or stored at −20 °C. The following probe and primers were used to detect parasite 18 S rRNA: Taqman® MGB probe (Applied Biosystems, sequence 5′-6FAM-CAG GTC TGT GAT GTC C-MGBNFQ-3′); sequence detection primer 1 (Applied Biosystems, sequence 5′-TAA CAC AAG GAA GTT TAA GGC AAC A-3′); sequence detection primer 2 (Applied Biosystems, sequence 5′-CGC GTG CAG CCT AGT TTA TCT-3′). To prepare the qRT-PCR plate, cDNA (∼15–20 ng/ml), probe (250 nm), and primers (600 nm) were mixed with TaqMan® Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) to a total volume of 20 μl per reaction in a MicroAmp Fast Optical 96-well reaction plate (Applied Biosystems). The reaction plate was then placed in a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) to quantify parasite 18 S rRNA using the default thermal cycling conditions as follows: stage 1 enzyme activation, 95 °C for 20 s; stage 2 (repeated 40 times), melting at 95 °C for 3 s, annealing, and polymerizing at 60 °C for 30 s. Results were analyzed automatically once after each run was completed. Experimental samples were compared with the standard curve generated from host cell/sporozoite mixtures containing known numbers of sporozoites. The percent inhibition was determined by comparing the number of sporozoites invaded after mAb treatment with the number of sporozoites invaded without mAb treatment. Sporozoite extract, equivalent to ∼2 × 106 sporozoites per lane, was loaded onto a 4–12% gradient BisTris gel under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Samples analyzed under reduced conditions were either mixed with dithiothreitol (DTT) (Sigma) at a final concentration of 50 mm (reduced) or mixed with DTT followed by treatment with iodoacetamide (Sigma) at a final concentration of 200 mm (reduced and alkylated). Following the electrophoretic separation, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting using standard methods (22Narum D.L. Nguyen V. Zhang Y. Glen J. Shimp R.L. Lambert L. Ling I.T. Reiter K. Ogun S.A. Long C. Holder A.A. Herrera R. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23Narum D.L. Ogun S.A. Thomas A.W. Holder A.A. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2899-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). All washes were performed in 1× PBS with 0.5% Tween 20. Development of the membrane was performed by incubating the nitrocellulose membrane with 0.5 μg/ml purified IgG from the CSP-specific mAbs diluted in blocking buffer (1× PBS, 0.5% Tween 20, and 5% skim milk). Primary antibody was detected with goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Detection was achieved using the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium-component phosphatase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), as per the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant protein was performed on 4–12% gradient BisTris polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) under nonreducing and reduced/alkylated conditions. Immunoblotting was performed as described above using 4–12% gradient BisTris polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) under nonreducing, reducing, and reduced/alkylated conditions. Immunofluorescence assay analysis was performed as per standard protocol (24Singh S. Plassmeyer M. Gaur D. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20043-20048Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Sporozoites collected by the Ozaki method were washed with RPMI medium and incubated with blocking media (1× PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin) at 4 °C (25Ozaki L.S. Gwadz R.W. Godson G.N. J. Parasitol. 1984; 70: 831-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All primary and secondary antibody incubations were carried out at 4 °C and separated by extensive washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad). The samples were mounted under coverslips using Vectashield hard-set mounting medium and then stored at 4 °C until images were acquired by confocal microscopy as described previously (24Singh S. Plassmeyer M. Gaur D. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20043-20048Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A Leica SP2 confocal microscope using Leica confocal software was used for image acquisition. All images were collected by using a PL APO ×100/1.4 oil immersion objective and a confocal zoom of ×6. Alexa 488 conjugate was excited by an argon laser (488 nm). All images were collected as three-dimensional data sets (z-stacks) with a step size of 0.1221 nm between the successive optical sections. De-convolution of all image stacks was performed using Huygens Essential (Scientific Volume Imaging) to improve the maximum resolution of the data, as well as to minimize background noise. Deconvolved images were saved and analyzed through Imaris image analysis software (version 5.7.2, Bitplane). Confocal images in this study are displayed as maximum projection of the three-dimensional image stacks. The amino acid sequence of CSP (Indian isolate, GenBankTM accession number AAN87606) was used to generate a codon-optimized synthetic gene for expression in E. coli (GeneArt, Regensburg, Germany). The construct, corresponding to amino acids Leu19 to Ser411 of the full-length CSP, was subcloned into the E. coli pET-24a+ expression vector downstream of the T7 promoter using the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites (EMD Chemicals Inc., Gibbstown, NJ). The resulting transcribed gene incorporates the additional amino acid sequence LEHHHHHH. Recombinant EcCSP was expressed using E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Fermentation of BL21(DE3)-EcCSP was performed in a 5-liter bioreactor using defined medium at 37 °C, as described previously (26Singh S. Kennedy M.C. Long C.A. Saul A.J. Miller L.H. Stowers A.W. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 6766-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When the absorbance at 550 nm reached 40–45, the temperature was reduced to 25 °C and induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm for 3 h. Cell culture was harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. The frozen cell pellet was disrupted using either mechanical lysis or chemical lysis. For mechanical lysis, the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 m urea, 5 mm DTT) and passed through a microfluidizer (M110Y, Microfluidics Corp., Newton, MA) three times at 19,000 pounds/square inch. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g to pellet and remove the inclusion bodies and cellular debris. EcCSP was then captured from the soluble fraction using a nickel-Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) column under reducing and denaturing conditions using a buffer containing 6 m guanidine-HCl and 5 mm DTT. For chemical lysis, the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of lysis buffer (20 mm citrate, 1% SB3-12 (Sigma), 0.1% ABS-14 (Sigma), 75 mm NaCl, pH 7.7) and mixed for 2 h at room temperature. Following the addition of lysis buffer to the cell pellet, 25 units of benzonase (Novagen/EMD Chemicals, Inc., Gibbstown, NJ) per ml of lysis buffer was added. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g to pellet inclusion bodies and cellular debris. Inclusion bodies were washed with water and then solubilized in solubilization buffer (11 mm Tris, 111 mm sodium phosphate, 6 m guanidine-HCl, pH 8.0) overnight at room temperature. Solubilized EcCSP was captured under reducing and denaturing conditions using a nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) column. Nickel-captured EcCSP was refolded on a Sephacryl S-300 HR column. A sample load of ∼2–3% of a column volume was loaded on a pre-equilibrated column with refold buffer 1 (20 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm guanidine-HCl, 1 m urea, 500 mm arginine, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.2) and eluted from the column using refold buffer 2 (20 mm sodium phosphate, 1 m urea, 500 mm arginine, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2). EcCSP was subsequently dialyzed and purified on a Q-Sepharose HP (GE Healthcare) column and polished using a size exclusion Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) column. As with the E. coli expression of CSP, the amino acid sequence of CSP (GenBankTM accession number AAN87606) was used to produce a Pichia codon optimized synthetic gene for expression in the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris (Invitrogen). A shortened CSP construct corresponding to amino acids Gly86 to Ser410 was cloned into the XhoI and XbaI sites of the Pichia expression vector pPICZαA as per the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting transcribed gene lacked a His6 tag. Prior to linearization with SacI and transformation into P. pastoris, the gene sequence of CSP was verified. Recombinant protein was produced in 5-liter bioreactors as described previously (22Narum D.L. Nguyen V. Zhang Y. Glen J. Shimp R.L. Lambert L. Ling I.T. Reiter K. Ogun S.A. Long C. Holder A.A.

Biotechnol. 2006; 121: 458-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A scalable purification process will be detailed elsewhere. However, in brief, secreted PpCSP was subjected to depth filtration (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany), followed by capture on a CM Hyper Z column (Pall, East Hills, NY), purification by Q-Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare), and polished with a size exclusion Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). The final bulk antigen was diluted to 1.0 mg/ml in saline, pH 7.4, sterile-filtered, and stored at −80 °C. Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using a BIAcore 3000 biosensor, operating with the BIAcore Control software (BIAcore 3000, BIAcore AB, Sweden). All experiments were performed at 25 °C. Three kinetic binding assays were employed to ascertain the binding properties of the recombinant CS proteins. Three mAbs, 1G12, 4B3, and 4C2, were immobilized to the CM5 sensor chip using an amine coupling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). The CM5 chip surface was activated with an equal molar mix of N-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, followed by immobilization of mAbs 1G12 in 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 4B3 in 10 mm acetate, pH 6.5, or 4C2 in 10 mm acetate, pH 6.0. Unreacted sites were blocked with ethanolamine (GE Healthcare). Each of the mAbs was immobilized in either flow cell 2 or 4 at 600 response units, whereas flow cells 1 and 3 were activated and then de-activated to serve as reference surfaces. For the interaction studies, recombinant CS proteins were serially diluted in Hanks' balanced solution buffer (GE Healthcare) at concentrations from 10 nm to 1 μm. Samples were injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 2 min. The sensor chip was regenerated using two injections at 30 μl/min of 10 mm glycine, pH 3.0, for 30 and 10 s with a 2-min stabilization period. Data were analyzed using BIAevaluation (GE Healthcare) and fit a 1:1 model. For the indirect kinetic analysis, mAb 4B3 was immobilized on a CM5 chip as stated previously. CS prote"
https://openalex.org/W1964375147,"The synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin 1 is thought to convey the calcium signal onto the core secretory machinery. Its cytosolic portion mainly consists of two C2 domains, which upon calcium binding are enabled to bind to acidic lipid bilayers. Despite major advances in recent years, it is still debated how synaptotagmin controls the process of neurotransmitter release. In particular, there is disagreement with respect to its calcium binding properties and lipid preferences. To investigate how the presence of membranes influences the calcium affinity of synaptotagmin, we have now measured these properties under equilibrium conditions using isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Our data demonstrate that the acidic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), but not phosphatidylserine, markedly increases the calcium sensitivity of synaptotagmin. PI(4,5)P2 binding is confined to the C2B domain but is not affected significantly by mutations of a lysine-rich patch. Together, our findings lend support to the view that synaptotagmin functions by binding in a trans configuration whereby the C2A domain binds to the synaptic vesicle and the C2B binds to the PI(4,5)P2-enriched plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2111379402,"Defective responses to DNA single strand breaks underlie various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the exact role of this repair pathway during the development and maintenance of the nervous system is unclear. Using murine neural-specific inactivation of Xrcc1, a factor that is critical for the repair of DNA single strand breaks, we found a profound neuropathology that is characterized by the loss of cerebellar interneurons. This cell loss was linked to p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and occurred as interneuron progenitors commenced differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W1996870265,"Little is known about the regulation of eicosanoid synthesis proximal to the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α), the initial rate-limiting step. The current view is that cPLA2α associates with intracellular/phosphatidylcholine-rich membranes strictly via hydrophobic interactions in response to an increase of intracellular calcium. In opposition to this accepted mechanism of two decades, ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P) has been shown to increase the membrane association of cPLA2α in vitro via a novel site in the cationic β-groove of the C2 domain (Stahelin, R.

In this study we demonstrate that C1P is a proximal and required bioactive lipid for the translocation of cPLA2α to intracellular membranes in response to inflammatory agonists (e.g. calcium ionophore and ATP). Last, the absolute requirement of the C1P/cPLA2α interaction was demonstrated for the production of eicosanoids using murine embryonic fibroblasts (cPLA2α−/−) coupled to “rescue” studies.

The production of AA is the initial rate-limiting step in the production of eicosanoids, and the major phospholipase that regulates eicosanoids synthesis in response to agonists is group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2α) (2Clark J.D.

Activation of cPLA2 in cells requires the association of the enzyme with intracellular membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This translocation of cPLA2α from the cytosol to intracellular membranes is mediated by a Ca2+-dependent lipid binding domain (CaLB domain) located at the N terminus of the enzyme (4Reynolds L.J.

However, it is not known if physiologic calcium is sufficient to activate and translocate cPLA2α to membranes in cells or if activation also requires the generation of other activating lipids, such as the focus of this study, ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P).One possible activating lipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate, was ruled out by Balboa and co-workers (11Casas J. Gijón M.A. Vigo A.G. Crespo M.S. Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) as a lipid co-factor required for the translocation of the enzyme. This group showed that the interaction with this lipid (via its catalytic domain) was required for full activity of cPLA2α after the enzyme translocated to the membrane (11Casas J.

Specifically, we showed that C1P induced a dramatic increase of cPLA2α activity strictly by increasing the residence time of cPLA2α to membranes, whereas phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate enhanced the enzymes catalytic activity and membrane penetration (13Subramanian P.

Mutations of specific amino acids of this region significantly reduced the affinity for C1P (>65%) without an effect on basal enzyme activity, calcium-dependent PC affinity (supplemental Table 1), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate activation/affinity (1Stahelin R.V.

The identification and characterization of the C1P interaction site in cPLA2α allowed our laboratory to determine whether C1P played a role in regulating cPLA2α translocation and, thus, eicosanoid synthesis in response to inflammatory agonists.DISCUSSIONIn this study we demonstrate that C1P is a proximal and required bioactive lipid for the activation of cPLA2α. Specifically, the interaction of C1P with cPLA2α was necessary for the translocation of the enzyme to internal membranes and for the production of the eicosanoid subspecies, PGE2, in response to various inflammatory agonists (e.g. calcium ionophore, ATP, TNFα, and IL-1β). Previously activation/translocation of cPLA2α in cells was shown to require the association of cPLA2α with membranes via the Ca2+-dependent lipid binding domain (CaLB domain) (3Leslie C.C. J. Biol.

For two decades, the theory of cPLA2α activation/translocation held that the enzyme interacted with PC-rich membranes in response to an intracellular calcium increase via charge-negation and hydrophobic interactions. Whereas this theory could not explain the micromolar kca for the interaction of the enzyme with PC vesicles, the CaLB domain was indeed required for the enzyme to bind substrate PC in a Ca2+-dependent manner as well as required for agonist-induced activation of the enzyme in cells (3Leslie C.C.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, this study explicitly demonstrates that Ca2+ alone is not sufficient to activate and translocate the enzyme to internal membranes in cells (3Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 32Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Li W.H. Llopis J. Dennis E.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5398-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the interaction of C1P with β-groove of the CaLB domain of cPLA2α is a requirement for efficient recruitment of the enzyme to internal PC-rich membranes in response to calcium and inflammatory agonists, dispelling the dogmatic theory of two decades while corroborating the requirement of the CaLB domain. Furthermore, substrate PC is not sufficient to effect the translocation of cPLA2α under physiologic conditions as the enzyme is cytosolic before activation even though PC is present in membranes in great abundance (33Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Therefore, this study demonstrates the absolute requirement of the C1P/cPLA2α interaction for the activation of cPLA2α during the inflammatory response. Because C1P has been shown to be essential in the translocation of cPLA2α, we can also now deduce a link between the production of C1P and inflammatory responses.The requirement of C1P in the translocation/activation of cPLA2α adds another level of complexity to the activation of this enzyme. Multiple levels of regulation are not uncommon for many rate-limiting steps in biosynthetic pathways, and both lipid co-factors and post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation at serine 505, 515, and 727 have been reported in regulating the activation of cPLA2α. Currently, the role of phosphorylation of cPLA2α in the induction of translocation is controversial due to conflicting reports, but the requirement of the phosphorylation of cPLA2α at serine 505, 515, and 727 for full activity of the enzyme in vitro and in vivo is not questioned based on studies from a number of laboratories (34Thomas W. Coen N. Faherty S. Flatharta C.O. Harvey B.J. Steroids. 2006; 71: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 35Pavicevic Z. Leslie C.C. Malik K.U. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37542-37551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Specifically, recent findings suggest that in response to an inflammatory agonist, cPLA2α is phosphorylated on serine 515 by CAMKII followed by serines 505 and 727 by serine/threonine kinases of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (34Thomas W. Coen N. Faherty S. Flatharta C.O. Harvey B.J. Steroids. 2006; 71: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 35Pavicevic Z. Leslie C.C. Malik K.U. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37542-37551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As with the lipid co-factor, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate, the bulk of the data suggests that phosphorylation plays more of a role in enzyme activity once the enzyme is associated with endogenous membranes. In regard to the translocation of cPLA2α, the only other report as to a required mechanism for the translocation of cPLA2α suggested that ceramide played a role in the association of cPLA2α to membranes via the CaLB domain (37Huwiler A. Johansen B. Skarstad A. Pfeilschifter J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 7-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These findings have met with skepticism in recent years because of the similarity of ceramide effects to diacylglycerol on cPLA2α activity in vitro and the inability of other laboratories to repeat the findings on the ceramide/cPLA2α interaction at near physiologic salt concentrations. Thus, ceramide 1-phosphate is currently the only lipid known to strongly interact with cPLA2α and dramatically regulate the association of enzyme with PC-rich vesicles and, now, because of this study, internal membranes in “live” cells.Based on the findings in this study and the reports in the literature, one can now theorize the scenario of this complex activation of cPLA2α. Essentially, most inflammatory agonists induce an increase in intracellular calcium. Upon the increase in intracellular calcium, CAMKII becomes activated, leading to the phosphorylation of serine 515 followed by phosphorylation of serine 505 and serine 727. Simultaneously, calcium and possibly CAMKII (there is a consensus CAMKII phospho-site in ceramide kinase) lead to the induction of ceramide 1-phosphate in PC-rich membranes. A fully active cPLA2α interacts with C1P increasing residence time at internal membranes followed by phosphoinositide (PIP) association and membrane penetration of the catalytic domain of cPLA2α (Fig. 5). In support of this theory of cPLA2α activation by PIPs after C1P association, PIPs would be localized near “pools” of C1P in the trans-Golgi due to 1) ceramide kinase localizing to PIPs via its PH-domain and 2) ceramide transport protein, the protein that delivers substrate ceramide to the trans-Golgi for ceramide kinase, which requires PIP association to insert ceramide into membranes. Thus, future studies are warranted to explore this hypothesis in detail.One inconsistency with our findings of a role for CERK-derived C1P as a major player in cPLA2α activation and eicosanoid synthesis in cells and in vivo are recent studies by Bornancin and co-workers (26Graf C. Niwa S. Müller M. Kinzel B. Bornancin F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 373: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Boath A. Graf C. Lidome E. Ullrich T. Nussbaumer P. Bornancin F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8517-8526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These researchers found that cells derived from mice with the genetic ablation of CERK had no effect on AA release and eicosanoid synthesis in response to inflammatory agonists. There are two plausible explanations for the incongruent findings of this study and the Bornancin study. First, at least one other biosynthetic pathway for the generation of C1P exists (see Fig. 1, panel D), which may provide the C1P for activation of cPLA2α in the cell models used by the Bornancin group (e.g. peritoneal macrophages) (26Graf C. Niwa S. Müller M. Kinzel B. Bornancin F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 373: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our presented study utilizes a mutant cPLA2α, which specifically focuses on the interaction of C1P and cPLA2α, negating the unknown specificity of CERK for eicosanoid generation in other cell models. A second explanation could simply be adaptation in the CERK knock-out mouse. To date, only one chain length of C1P has been examined in the CERK knock-out mouse. It is plausible that increases (or changes in subcellular localization) in other chain lengths of C1P via up-regulation of separate anabolic pathways could lead to adaptation, making conclusions for a non-role of CERK in eicosanoid synthesis premature at this time. Regardless, the presented study demonstrates an absolute requirement for the C1P/cPLA2α interaction for the induction of cPLA2α translocation and eicosanoid synthesis in response to inflammatory agonists. Further studies will hopefully determine whether these unknown pathways of C1P generation can “cross”-signal or whether they play roles in different cellular mechanisms.This plausible link between C1P generation and inflammation coupled with this study demonstrating that C1P is upstream of cPLA2α activation may lead to a much-needed and new generation of therapeutics for inflammatory disorders and cancer. For example, a chemical inhibitor of cPLA2α as well as genetic ablation of cPLA2α was also shown to prevent the development of airway inflammation in the AHR mouse model of asthma (38Malaviya R. Ansell J. Hall L. Fahmy M. Argentieri R.L. Olini Jr., G.C. Pereira D.W. Sur R. Cavender D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 539: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Ablation of the cPLA2α gene also significantly reduced pulmonary edema, and cPLA2α is also found to be a mediator of acute lung injury induced by sepsis via production of inflammatory mediators, such as eicosanoids (38Malaviya R. Ansell J. Hall L. Fahmy M. Argentieri R.L. Olini Jr., G.C. Pereira D.W. Sur R. Cavender D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 539: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In regard to cancer phenotypes, COX-2-derived eicosanoids, such as PGE2, contribute to tumorigenesis (39Jakobsson P.J. Thorén S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Indeed, COX-2 has been shown to be up-regulated in colon cancer, breast, and lung cancers (40Kutchera W. Jones D.A.

Vainio H. Ristimäki A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4997-5001PubMed Google Scholar), and research studies have shown that the levels of PGE2 is higher in cancer tissue and than in normal tissue (43McLemore T.L. Hubbard W.C.

Subbaramaiah K. Nemenoff R.A. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) demonstrated that increased PGE2 levels are necessary for the production of lung tumors in mice. Furthermore, breeding the knock-out mice for cPLA2α or COX-2 with a mouse model of adenomatous polyposis dramatically reduced the multiplicity and size of colon tumors (46Fosslien E. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2000; 37: 431-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 47Williams J.L. Borgo S. Hasan I. Castillo E. Traganos F. Rigas B.

Taken together, these observations suggested that ablation of this pathway regulated by the direct target of C1P, cPLA2α, has potential as a drug target for lung inflammation, osteoarthritis, and cancer.For specific targeting of eicosanoid synthesis, inhibitors of the cPLA2α/C1P interaction would provide high specificity for this mechanism while keeping the potential therapeutic value for treating the mentioned disorders. The production of this type of inhibitor may not even be a challenging undertaking because C1P interacts with cPLA2α with a stoichiometry of >4.8 molecules of C1P (13Subramanian P. Stahelin R.V.

Furthermore, published findings from Goñi and Alonso suggest that a multimeric lipid structure of ≥6 molecules of C1P is formed in cellular membranes (48Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Based on the calcium dependence of the C1P/cPLA2α interaction, it is not inconceivable that calcium may regulate the conformation of this lipid structure modulating the specificity of protein/lipid interactions. Compounds synthesized to specifically block the formation of this structure may indeed provide a new generation of specific anti-inflammatory therapeutics while limiting unwanted side effects.In conclusion, this study shows that C1P fulfills all five requirements of a regulated and bioactive lipid. First, both this study and previous studies have shown that C1P levels are regulated in response to inflammatory agonists. Second, our previous work has also shown that exogenous C1P induces a specific biochemical and cellular response (release of AA), and this action of C1P demonstrated high lipid specificity in the induction of cPLA2α interaction/activation, AA release, and eicosanoid synthesis (1Stahelin R.V.

Last, the interaction of C1P and cPLA2α is explicitly required for activation and translocation of the enzyme as well as subsequent prostanoid synthesis. Therefore, the presented study provides the last “missing link” in cPLA2α translocation and activation, validating C1P as a new lipid messenger in biological systems. This study should generate significant insight into novel aspects of signal transduction by lipids, activation of cPLA2α, and the regulation of prostaglandin synthesis. It also suggests C1P/cPLA2α interaction as a novel target for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics for inflammatory disorders, cancer, and sepsis.

The production of AA is the initial rate-limiting step in the production of eicosanoids, and the major phospholipase that regulates eicosanoids synthesis in response to agonists is group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2α) (2Clark J.D.

Activation of cPLA2 in cells requires the association of the enzyme with intracellular membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This translocation of cPLA2α from the cytosol to intracellular membranes is mediated by a Ca2+-dependent lipid binding domain (CaLB domain) located at the N terminus of the enzyme (4Reynolds L.J.

https://openalex.org/W2075482716,"Chromosomal replication initiation requires the regulated formation of dynamic higher order complexes. Escherichia coli ATP-DnaA forms a specific multimer on oriC, resulting in DNA unwinding and DnaB helicase loading. DiaA, a DnaA-binding protein, directly stimulates the formation of ATP-DnaA multimers on oriC and ensures timely replication initiation. In this study, DnaA Phe-46 was identified as the crucial DiaA-binding site required for DiaA-stimulated ATP-DnaA assembly on oriC. Moreover, we show that DiaA stimulation requires only a subgroup of DnaA molecules binding to oriC, that DnaA Phe-46 is also important in the loading of DnaB helicase onto the oriC-DnaA complexes, and that this process also requires only a subgroup of DnaA molecules. Despite the use of only a DnaA subgroup, DiaA inhibited DnaB loading on oriC-DnaA complexes, suggesting that DiaA and DnaB bind to a common DnaA subgroup. A cellular factor can relieve the DiaA inhibition, allowing DnaB loading. Consistently, DnaA F46A caused retarded initiations in vivo in a DiaA-independent manner. It is therefore likely that DiaA dynamics are crucial in the regulated sequential progress of DnaA assembly and DnaB loading. We accordingly propose a model for dynamic structural changes of initial oriC complexes loading DiaA or DnaB helicase."

Although a number of PPARγ target genes that may contribute to the reduction of circulating free fatty acids after TZD treatment have been identified, the relevant PPARγ target genes that may exert the anti-lipolytic effect of TZDs are unknown. Here we identified the anti-lipolytic human G-protein-coupled receptor 81 (GPR81), GPR109A, and the (human-specific) GPR109B genes as well as the mouse Gpr81 and Gpr109A genes as novel TZD-induced genes in mature adipocytes. GPR81/Gpr81 is a direct PPARγ target gene, because mRNA expression of GPR81/Gpr81 (and GPR109A/Gpr109A) increased in mature human and murine adipocytes as well as in vivo in epididymal fat pads of mice upon rosiglitazone stimulation, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of PPARγ in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed a significant decrease in Gpr81 protein expression. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells revealed a conserved PPAR:retinoid X receptor-binding site in the proximal promoter of the Gpr81 gene, which was proven to be functional by electromobility shift assay and reporter assays. Importantly, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Gpr81 partly reversed the inhibitory effect of TZDs on lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Because of a high calorie diet and a sedentary lifestyle, obesity and its associated co-morbidities like hypertension, type II diabetes, and atherosclerosis rapidly increase worldwide (1James W.P. J. Intern. Med. 2008; 263: 336-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Adipose tissue is the major site of lipid storage in the body and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of whole body metabolic homeostasis and therefore in the pathophysiology of obesity (2Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2006; 444: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). After a meal, excess fuel substrates are partitioned to adipose tissue where they are processed and stored as triglycerides (TAG). 2The abbreviations used are: TAGtriglycerideChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationEMSAelectromobility shift assayFAfatty acidFFAfree fatty acidGPRG-protein-coupled receptorLPLlipoprotein lipasehMADShuman multipotent adipose-derived stem cellsPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorPPREPPAR-response elementRXRretinoid X receptorSGBSSimpson-Golabi Behmel syndromeTZDthiazolidinedionePPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor γChIP-seqsequencing ChIPsiRNAsmall interfering RNARTreverse transcription. 2The abbreviations used are: TAGtriglycerideChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationEMSAelectromobility shift assayFAfatty acidFFAfree fatty acidGPRG-protein-coupled receptorLPLlipoprotein lipasehMADShuman multipotent adipose-derived stem cellsPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorPPREPPAR-response elementRXRretinoid X receptorSGBSSimpson-Golabi Behmel syndromeTZDthiazolidinedionePPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor γChIP-seqsequencing ChIPsiRNAsmall interfering RNARTreverse transcription. Conversely, during fasting TAGs are hydrolyzed to free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol, and the FFA released into the bloodstream can subsequently be used by other organs as energy substrates. The latter process, termed lipolysis, is tightly regulated by hormones and cytokines (3Duncan R.E. Ahmadian M. Jaworski K. Sarkadi-Nagy E. Sul H.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2007; 27: 79-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The three main hormones that regulate lipolysis in humans are insulin, which inhibits lipolysis, and catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline) and glucagon, which stimulate lipolysis. In rodents, inhibition of lipolysis by adenosine presents an additional regulatory pathway. Lipolysis is deregulated in obesity; basal lipolysis rates are increased (4Reynisdottir S. Langin D. Carlström K. Holm C. Rössner S. Arner P. Clin. Sci. 1995; 89: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas the stimulation of lipolysis by catecholamines (5Large V. Peroni O. Letexier D. Ray H. Beylot M. Diabetes Metab. 2004; 30: 294-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) as well as the anti-lipolytic action of insulin (6Jensen M.D. Haymond M.W. Rizza R.A. Cryer P.E. Miles J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1168-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) are inhibited. The impairment of hormonal control of lipolysis may be due to high levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, which is overproduced by adipose tissue in obese humans and rodents (7Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (5970) Google Scholar). Deregulated lipolysis results in increased circulating FFA levels and lipid accumulation in nonadipose tissues, ultimately contributing to insulin resistance and other obesity-related metabolic disorders (8Bays H. Mandarino L. DeFronzo R.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). triglyceride chromatin immunoprecipitation electromobility shift assay fatty acid free fatty acid G-protein-coupled receptor lipoprotein lipase human multipotent adipose-derived stem cells peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPAR-response element retinoid X receptor Simpson-Golabi Behmel syndrome thiazolidinedione peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ sequencing ChIP small interfering RNA reverse transcription. triglyceride chromatin immunoprecipitation electromobility shift assay fatty acid free fatty acid G-protein-coupled receptor lipoprotein lipase human multipotent adipose-derived stem cells peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPAR-response element retinoid X receptor Simpson-Golabi Behmel syndrome thiazolidinedione peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ sequencing ChIP small interfering RNA reverse transcription. One of the key regulators of adipocyte differentiation, maintenance, and function is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors (9Lehrke M. Lazar M.A. Cell. 2005; 123: 993-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). PPARγ exists in two isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2. PPARγ2 has an additional 30 amino acids at the N terminus, and its expression is restricted to adipose tissue, while PPARγ1 is more widely distributed (e.g. adipocytes, lower intestine, monocytes, and macrophages). In vitro and in vivo studies showed that PPARγ is both necessary and sufficient to induce adipogenesis (9Lehrke M. Lazar M.A. Cell. 2005; 123: 993-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). PPARγ bind as an obligate heterodimer with the retinoic acid X receptors (RXRs) to PPAR-responsive elements (PPREs), which consist of two direct repeats of six nucleotides (AGGTCA) interspaced by one nucleotide (DR-1). Upon binding of ligand these proteins undergo a conformational change, which allows the interaction with so-called coactivators, starting a cascade of protein interactions and modifications that finally results in the induction of specific target genes (10Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the endogenous ligands for PPARγ have not been firmly established, natural compounds like polyunsaturated fatty acids and eicosanoids have been shown to activate PPARγ. In addition, the antidiabetic drugs, such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) act as high affinity PPARγ ligands (11Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3435) Google Scholar). Administration of these TZDs to obese and/or insulin-resistant patients has been shown to reduce circulating FFAs and thereby improve insulin sensitivity. Part of these effects may be explained by the stimulatory effect of TZDs on adipocyte differentiation, thereby increasing lipid storage capacity in adipose tissue. In addition, PPARγ also regulates a number of genes essential for the adipocytic phenotype, such as genes involved in lipid uptake, lipid synthesis, lipid droplet stabilization, glycerol/FA recycling, and FA oxidation (12Nielsen R. Pedersen T.A. Hagenbeek D. Moulos P. Siersbaek R. Megens E. Denissov S. Børgesen M. Francoijs K.J. Mandrup S. Stunnenberg H.G. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2953-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Because elevated levels of serum FFAs promote insulin resistance (13Boden G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), an important potential mechanism for the beneficial effects of TZDs is therefore the net partitioning of lipids in adipose tissue. Consistent with this notion, genes encoding proteins involved in lipid uptake in adipocytes, such as lipoprotein lipase, CD36, and the oxidized LDL receptor have been reported to be directly regulated by PPARγ (9Lehrke M. Lazar M.A. Cell. 2005; 123: 993-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). In addition, PPARγ directly regulates the expression of genes directly involved in lipid storage, like the lipid-droplet proteins perilipin and S3-12 (14Dalen K.T. Schoonjans K. Ulven S.M. Weedon-Fekjaer M.S. Bentzen T.G. Koutnikova H. Auwerx J. Nebb H.I. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). PPARγ also regulates genes (potentially) involved in the “futile cycle” (9Lehrke M. Lazar M.A. Cell. 2005; 123: 993-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 15Kershaw E.E. Schupp M. Guan H.P. Gardner N.P. Lazar M.A. Flier J.S. Am. J. Physiol.

Several findings suggest that PPARγ and TZDs may also be implicated in the regulation of lipolysis. First, the TZD troglitazone has been shown to lower basal lipolysis rates in differentiated adipocytes (this study and see Refs. (17Lenhard J.M. Kliewer S.A. Paulik M.A. Plunket K.D. Lehmann J.M.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Okazaki H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Yahagi N. Tomita S. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Kimura S. Gotoda T. Shimano H. Yamada N. Ishibashi S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3368-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Second, introduction of a dominant-negative form of PPARγ in mature adipocytes resulted in increased lipolysis, suggesting that PPARγ normally inhibits this process (22Tamori Y. Masugi J. Nishino N. Kasuga M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2045-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Finally, treatment of diabetic patients with TZDs has been shown to restore insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis (23Miles J.M. Wooldridge D. Grellner W.J. Windsor S. Isley W.L. Klein S. Harris W.S. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Boden G. Cheung P. Mozzoli M. Fried S.K.

Metabolism. 2002; 51: 169-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the relevant PPARγ target genes that may exert the anti-lipolytic effect of TZDs are unknown. To identify novel target genes that may play a role in the effects of TZDs on lipid metabolism, we performed a transcriptome analysis in human adipocytes treated with the TZD rosiglitazone. In this study we show that TZDs induce the expression of two anti-lipolytic G-protein-coupled receptors, GPR81/Gpr81 and GPR109A/Gpr109A, in human and murine adipocytes. In addition, a third anti-lipolytic GPR, the human-specific GPR109B, is also induced by rosiglitazone. This PPARγ-mediated activation may occur through a conserved PPRE located in the GPR81 promoter. The coordinated PPARγ-mediated regulation of the GPR81/Gpr81 and GPR109A/Gpr109A genes (and GPR109B in humans) presents a novel mechanism by which TZDs may reduce circulating FFA levels and perhaps ameliorate insulin resistance in obese patients. Rosiglitazone and GW9662 were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals and Cayman Chemical, respectively. Anti-PPARγ antibody (2345S) was from Cell Signaling; anti-GPR81 antibody (NLS2095) was from Novus Biologicals; anti-GPR109A (GTX12610) was from GeneTex, and anti-tubulin (T5168) was from Sigma.

Concentrations and purity were determined on a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Isogen). RNA integrity was checked on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) with 6000 NanoChips. Part of the RNA samples from four 6-cm dishes was used for quantitative RT-PCR (see under “RNA Isolation and Real Time PCR”). Remaining RNA samples from four 6-cm dishes were pooled and used for microarray analysis. Samples were hybridized on human NUGO arrays from Affymetrix.

At 20 weeks of age, the diet of half of the mice group was supplemented with rosiglitazone (0.01% w/w) for a week. At the end of the experiment epididymal white adipose tissue was dissected, weighed, and used for RNA isolation. The animal experiments were approved by the animal experimentation committee of Wageningen University. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were differentiated as described above. Three independent samples of total RNA were extracted at different time points using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using the superscript first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Gene expression levels were determined by quantitative real time PCR with the MyIq cycler (Bio-Rad) using SYBR-green (Bio-Rad) and normalized to TFIIb expression. The primers used were as follows: murine TFIIb forward primer, 5′-TCCTCCTCAGACCGCTTTT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CCTGGTTCATCATCGCTAATC-3′; murine Gpr81 forward primer, 5′-GGTGGCACGATGTCATGTT-3′, and reverse primer 5′-GACCGAGCAGAACAAGATGATT-3′; murine Gpr109A forward primer, 5′-TCCAAGTCTCCAAAGGTGGT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TGTTTCTCTCCAGCACTGAGTT-3′; murine Fapb4 forward primer, 5′-GAAAACGAGATGGTGACAAGC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TTGTGGAAGTCACGCCTTT-3′; human 36B4 forward primer, 5′-CGGGAAGGCTGTGGTGCTG-3′, and reverse primer 5′- GTGAACACAAAGCCCACATTCC-3′; human GPR109A forward primer, 5′-TTCAGAGAATGCGATTTAGGG-3′, and reverse primer 5′-ACACCTTGCAACCAGTCTCC-3′; human GPR109B forward primer, 5′-TTCTGTGGGGCATCACTGT-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GCCATTCTGGATCAGCAACT-3′; and human GPR81 forward primer, 5′-AATTTGGCCGTGGCTGATTTC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-ACCGTAAGGAACACGATGCTC-3′. For Western blot analyses, differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8,0; 0,1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100; 10 mm EDTA; 150 mm NaCl; 1% sodium deoxycholate containing protease inhibitors). Total cell lysate was diluted in 4× Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore). α-PPARγ, α-GPR81, α-GPR109A, α-FABP4, and α-tubulin antibodies were used to probe for the respective proteins. ECL Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for detection, and signals were quantified using a densitometer. ChIP assays were performed exactly as described earlier (32Nielsen R. Grøntved L. Stunnenberg H.G. Mandrup S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5698-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The primers used for ChIP assays were as follows: murine Gpr81 forward primer, 5′-AGTGCCAGAGAGGGGAGACT-3′, and reverse primer 5′-CGTTTCTCTGCAGACCTTCC-3′; murine β-globin forward primer, 5′-CCTGCCCTCTCTATCCTGTG-3′, and reverse primer 5′-GCAAATGTGTTGCCAAAAAG-3′; human GPR81 forward primer, 5′-CTGGAGAGCACACAAAGCTG-3′, and reverse primer 5′-CCACTCCAGGAAATGTTTGG-3′; and human β-globin forward primer, 5′-TGGTATGGGGCCAAGAGATA-3′, and reverse primer 5′-TAGATGCCTCTGCCCTGACT-3′. ChIP-seq was performed as described earlier (12Nielsen R. Pedersen T.A. Hagenbeek D. Moulos P. Siersbaek R. Megens E. Denissov S. Børgesen M. Francoijs K.J. Mandrup S. Stunnenberg H.G.

The sequences of the double-stranded DNA oligomers used, containing the wild type or mutant PPRE from the mouse G-protein-coupled receptor 81 promoter (between −128 and −98 of the Gpr81 gene), were as follows: mGpr81 wild type, 5′-CCGGGGACGGGTAGTCAGGCAAAGGTTAGGGAGGA-3′; mGpr81 mutant A, 5′-CCGGGGACGGCAAGTCACCCAAAGGTTAGGGAGGA-3′; and mGpr81 mutant B, 5′-CCGGGACGGGTAGTCTCGCAAACCTTAGGGAGGA-3′. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated as described above. At day 6 cells were detached using 5× trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen), washed in medium containing 4% glycerol. For each reaction 2 million cells were resuspended in buffer L (AMAXA cell line Nucleofector kit L), and control (D-001210-01-20; Dharmacon), murine-specific PPARγ (number 2 J-040712-06 Dharmacon), or custom-made Gpr81 (5′-ACCTGGAAGTCAAGCACTATT; Dharmacon) siRNA oligonucleotides were delivered into adipocytes (500 nm of each siRNA/2 million cells) by electroporation (AMAXA Nucleofector II). Cells were reseeded, and 20 h post-electroporation cells were incubated with 1 μm rosiglitazone for an additional 28 h. Subsequently, cells were harvested for Western blot analysis, and media (n = 4) were collected for glycerol measurements. Glycerol levels were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions (Instruchemie). To identify novel TZD-regulated genes in mature human adipocytes, we performed transcriptome analysis in differentiated hMADs (30Rodriguez A.M. Elabd C. Delteil F. Astier J. Vernochet C.

Out of 361 genes that were up-regulated after 6 h of treatment with the TZD rosiglitazone (data not shown), we selected the human-specific G-protein-coupled receptor 109B (GPR109B) to explore in more detail. Together with GPR109A and GPR81, GPR109B belongs to the class A rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors. GPR109A (also called puma-g) and the human-specific GPR109B are 96% homologous (33Lee D.K.

Interestingly, the GPR81, GPR109A, and GPR109B genes are colocalized on human chromosome 12 and share synteny with murine Gpr81 and Gpr109A on mouse chromosome 5 (Fig. 1A) (45Offermanns S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 384-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For this reason, expression of the GPR109A and GPR81 genes, which were not represented on the microarray, was determined together with the GPR109B gene in differentiated hMADs cells. Using quantitative RT-PCR, mRNA expression of these three genes was found to increase 4–5-fold after treatment with rosiglitazone for 6 h (Fig. 1B). The same experiment was performed in another human adipocyte cell line, the SGBS cell line (29Wabitsch M. Brenner R.E. Melzner I. Braun M. Möller P. Heinze E. Debatin K.M. Hauner H. Int. J. Obes. Relat Metab. Disord. 2001; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In these cells a similar mRNA expression profile was observed (Fig. 1C). To investigate whether conserved mechanisms of regulation exist in mouse adipocytes, we examined the effect of rosiglitazone treatment on Gpr81 and Gpr109A mRNA expression in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As was observed for the human adipocytes, treatment of murine adipocytes with rosiglitazone stimulated the mRNA expression levels of Gpr81 and Gpr109A up to 4-fold (Fig. 1D). Finally, we examined the effect of rosiglitazone treatment"

IGFBP-3 potentiated EGF-stimulated EGF receptor activation and DNA synthesis, and this was blocked by inhibitors of SphK activity or small interference RNA-mediated silencing of SphK1, but not SphK2, expression. Similarly, IGFR1 phosphorylation and DNA synthesis stimulated by LR3-IGF-I (an IGF-I analog not bound by IGFBP-3), were enhanced by IGFBP-3, and this was blocked by SphK1 silencing. SphK1 expression and activity were stimulated by IGFBP-3 ∼2-fold over 24 h. Silencing of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) or S1P3, but not S1P2, abolished the effect of IGFBP-3 on EGF-stimulated EGFR activation. The effects of IGFBP-3 could be reproduced with exogenous S1P or medium conditioned by cells treated with IGFBP-3, and this was also blocked by inhibition of S1P1 and S1P3. These data indicate that potentiation of growth factor signaling by IGFBP-3 in MCF-10A cells requires SphK1 activity and S1P1/S1P3, suggesting that S1P, the product of SphK activity and ligand for S1P1 and S1P3, is the “missing link” mediating IGF and EGFR transactivation and cell growth stimulation by IGFBP-3.

Baxter R.C. Endocrine Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar). As the predominant carrier of IGFs in the endocrine system, IGFBP-3 regulates the movement of these growth factors from the circulation to target tissues and inhibits their proliferative and antiapoptotic cellular effects by blocking their activation of the type 1 IGF receptor (IGFR1) at the cell surface. In vitro studies in a variety of cell types have revealed that IGFBP-3 may also impact on cell growth and survival independently of modulating IGF bioactivity, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by regulation of apoptotic effector proteins (2Butt A.J.

Although the mechanism linking IGFBP-3 with growth stimulation in vivo remains unclear, we and others have shown that, in vitro, IGFBP-3 can enhance the effects of stimulatory growth factors. Human and bovine skin fibroblasts exposed to low concentrations of exogenous IGFBP-3 exhibit enhanced IGF-stimulated DNA synthesis (14DeMellow J.S. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In addition to transducing S1P signaling, the G-protein-coupled S1P receptors have been implicated in signal amplification of a variety of growth factors receptors, including the EGF and platelet-derived growth factor receptors, via receptor transactivation (23Daub H.

In this study we investigated whether the sphingosine kinase system is involved in modulation of growth factor receptor signaling pathways by IGFBP-3 and demonstrate that SphK1 expression is stimulated by IGFBP-3 in MCF-10A cells, and its activity is required for potentiation of EGF and IGF-I signaling by IGFBP-3 in these cells.DISCUSSIONDespite well documented growth-inhibitory and apoptotic activity in many cell types (3Butt A.J.

Indeed, we and others have described cell models where IGFBP-3 bioactivity undergoes a switch from antiproliferative to proliferative (36Butt A.J. Martin J.L. Dickson K.A. McDougall F. Firth S.M.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying this switch, and IGFBP-3's growth stimulatory and survival activity, are particularly important in light of suggestions that IGFBP-3 may constitute a novel therapy for the treatment of some malignancies (41Perks C. Holly J. Horm. Metab. Res. 2003; 35: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 42Ali O. Cohen P. Lee K.W. Horm. Metab. Res. 2003; 35: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Enhancement of growth factor activity by IGFBP-3 was first described by the authors' laboratory two decades ago, when it was shown that preincubation with IGFBP-3 enhanced subsequent IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis in human skin fibroblasts (14DeMellow J.S. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). This observation was later confirmed in bovine fibroblasts (15Conover C.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3191-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and the demonstration of enhancement of IGF bioactivity in IGFBP-3-overexpressing MCF-7 breast cancer cells (16Chen J.C. Shao Z.M. Sheikh M.S. Hussain A. LeRoith D. Roberts C.J. Fontana J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and bovine mammary cells (43Grill C.J. Cohick W.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) indicated that the phenomenon was neither cell type-specific or peculiar to non-transformed cell lines. More recently, we showed that IGFBP-3 also potentiates signaling and growth effects stimulated by EGF, with no evidence of direct interaction between IGFBP-3, and EGFR or EGF (18Martin J.L. Weenink S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2969-2976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the explanation of these stimulatory effects of IGFBP-3 has remained elusive.A clue that IGFBP-3 modulation of growth factor receptor signaling might explain, at least in part, its growth promoting effects in vivo came with our observation that xenograft tumors of T47D breast cancer cells expressing IGFBP-3, which grow faster than T47D cells that do not express IGFBP-3, have elevated tissue levels of EGFR, and exhibit increased sensitivity to EGF in vitro (36Butt A.J. Martin J.L. Dickson K.A. McDougall F. Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 1950-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This, taken together with the observation that the effects of IGFBP-3 on IGF-I bioactivity are also independent of direct interaction between growth factor and binding protein (15Conover C.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3191-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 43Grill C.J. Cohick W.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 44Conover C.A. Bale L.K. Durham S.K. Powell D.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3098-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), prompted us to explore the possibility of a single mechanism by which IGFBP-3 enhances growth factor signaling. The data presented here support this postulate by showing that the effects of IGFBP-3 on both EGFR and IGFR1 signaling pathways are blocked when SphK1 activity is down-regulated, either pharmacologically or by RNA interference silencing of expression. Although we have previously shown that IGFBP-3 potentiates the stimulatory effect of EGF on cell growth over 7 days, as well as DNA synthesis (18Martin J.L. Weenink S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2969-2976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), it was not possible in the present study to examine the effect of reducing SphK1 activity on 7-day cell growth, because SphK1 down-regulation or inhibition caused substantial cell death over this period (data not shown).The involvement of the SphK system in the effects of IGFBP-3 on growth factor receptor signaling is further supported by our finding that pharmacological inhibition or reduced expression of the S1P receptors S1P1 and S1P3 abolished potentiation of EGFR activation by IGFBP-3. This suggests that S1P1 and S1P3 act in a coordinated manner to enhance EGFR signaling. By contrast, silencing of S1P2 had no effect on EGFR phosphorylation. These findings are similar to those made in various cell models investigating other functions of S1P receptors, with silencing of S1P1 or S1P3 shown to abolish endothelial cell morphogenesis (45Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell. 1999; 99: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), S1P-mediated rescue from stress-induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (46Kwon Y.G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10627-10633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and migration of ovarian cancer cells (47Wang D. Zhao Z. Caperell-Grant A. Yang G. Mok S.C. Liu J. Bigsby R.M. Xu Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1993-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). By contrast, down-regulation of S1P2 is associated with increased proliferation and/or cell survival (47Wang D. Zhao Z. Caperell-Grant A. Yang G. Mok S.C. Liu J. Bigsby R.M. Xu Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1993-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that this receptor mediates inhibitory signaling.Direct measurement of S1P levels in conditioned media by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was unsuccessful due to insufficient assay sensitivity. However, supporting a role for extracellular S1P in IGFBP-3 effects, we showed that medium conditioned by cells treated with IGFBP-3, but stripped to remove added or cell-derived IGFBP-3, was able to enhance EGFR phosphorylation in a manner inhibitable by S1P1 and S1P3 blockade. Furthermore, exogenous S1P mimicked the effects of IGFBP-3 on growth factor receptor signaling and bioactivity. Taken together, our data point conclusively to S1P, the product of sphingosine kinase activity, being the “missing link” that mediates potentiation of IGF and EGF receptor activity and growth stimulation by IGFBP-3.The SphK system has been implicated in signaling involving numerous growth factor receptors with diverse function, including EGFR (23Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar), IGFR1 (29El-Shewy H.M. Johnson K.R. Lee M.H. Jaffa A.A. Obeid L.M. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31399-31407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (24Rosenfeldt H.M. Hobson J.P. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 836-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), vascular epidermal growth factor receptor (48Visentin B. Vekich J.A. Sibbald B.J. Cavalli A.L. Moreno K.M. Matteo R.G. Garland W.A. Lu Y. Yu S. Hall H.S. Kundra V. Mills G.B. Sabbadini R.A. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 225-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), and transforming growth factor-β receptor (49Xin C. Ren S. Kleuser B. Shabahang S. Eberhardt W. Radeke H. Schafer-Korting M. Pfeilschifter J. Huwiler A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35255-35262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Some of these effects appear to involve transactivation of growth factor receptors by S1P receptors, with consequent potentiation of downstream signaling pathways to promote cell proliferation, survival, and differentiated function (22Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Molec. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). A number of different mechanisms appear to be involved in enhancement of growth factor receptor signaling by the S1P receptors. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, increased EGFR activation in response to estrogen was secondary to increased SphK activity and S1P production, and required matrix metalloproteinase-activated release of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, a ligand for EGFR (28Sukocheva O. Wadham C. Holmes A. Albanese N. Verrier E. Feng F. Bernal A. Derian C.K. Ullrich A. Vadas M.A. Xia P. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It was postulated that, in this model, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor release required activation of S1P3 by extracellular S1P (28Sukocheva O. Wadham C. Holmes A. Albanese N. Verrier E. Feng F. Bernal A. Derian C.K. Ullrich A. Vadas M.A. Xia P. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the present study there was no evidence of activation of either EGFR or IGFR1 by IGFBP-3 in the absence of exogenous growth factor receptor ligands, arguing against IGFBP-3 inducing the release of endogenous ligands for EGFR or IGFR1 whether via SphK and S1P or independently of this system. Ligand-independent transactivation of EGFR by G-protein-coupled receptor has also been described (23Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar) and was suggested to involve intracellular signal cross-talk, although the underlying mechanism was not described. We propose that, in our cell model, the effects of IGFBP-3 on growth factor receptor activation also involve intracellular cross-talk between growth factor receptors and S1P-stimulated S1P receptors and are mediated directly by extracellular S1P.S1P stimulation of DNA synthesis in MCF-10A cells was reversed by inhibitors of EGFR or IGFR1 tyrosine kinase activity, and importantly, IGFBP-3 potentiation of LR3-IGF-I-stimulated IGFR1 activation was also prevented by EGFR kinase inhibitors. This suggests that there is significant cross-talk between these signaling receptors and pathways in these cells, and specifically, that EGF receptor transactivation by IGFBP-3 is required for the potentiating effect of IGFBP-3 on IGFR1 signaling. Consistent with the findings of the present study, IGF-stimulated phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase was blocked by an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ZD1839 or gefitinib) in normal breast epithelial cells (50Ahmad T. Farnie G. Bundred N.J. Anderson N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1713-1719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Of note, however, the effects of IGF-I were not blocked by ZD1839 in mammary fibroblasts or MCF-7 breast cancer cells (50Ahmad T. Farnie G. Bundred N.J. Anderson N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1713-1719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), implying the existence of complex cell type-specific mechanisms regulating receptor transactivation. Interestingly, that study also showed that IGFR1 and EGFR co-precipitated from breast epithelial cell lysates, suggesting physical interaction between the two receptors.It remains unclear how IGFBP-3 regulates expression of SphK1 in MCF-10A cells. Granata et al. (20Granata R. Trovato L. Lupia E. Sala G. Settanni F. Camussi G. Ghidoni R. Ghigo E. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 5: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) suggested that IGFBP-3 stimulation of SphK1 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells was secondary to increased expression and release of IGF-I, but the mechanism underlying IGFBP-3's induction of IGF-I expression was not addressed. In our cell model IGFBP-3 alone did not stimulate IGFR1 phosphorylation in MCF-10A cells, excluding the release of endogenous IGFR1 ligands in response to IGFBP-3. Furthermore, by contrast with the very rapid (within 5 min) increase in SphK expression in response to IGFBP-3 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (19Granata R. Trovato L. Garbarino G. Taliano M. Ponti R. Sala G. Ghidoni R. Ghigo E. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1456-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we found no significant effect of IGFBP-3 gene expression at time points earlier than 3 h in MCF-10A cells, protein expression was not elevated until 6 h after stimulation with IGFBP-3, and SphK1 activity was not significantly increased until after 10 h of treatment with IGFBP-3. Our observations are similar to a prolonged time-course reported for increased SphK expression and activity in response to estradiol in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (51Sukocheva O.A. Wang L. Albanese N. Pitson S.M. Vadas M.A. Xia P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 17: 2002-2012Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar), attributed to genotropic rather than non-genotropic actions of estradiol. Interestingly, we found that, whereas expression of SphK1 was reduced to unstimulated levels 24 h after addition of IGFBP-3, SphK1 enzyme activity remained high at this time point. This is likely to reflect a prerequisite for post-translational events, namely SphK1 phosphorylation and membrane translocation, for SphK1 enzyme activity (52Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5491-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) rather than simply the expression of the protein.Our observation of down-regulation of SphK2 gene expression over the same time course is also novel, because IGFBP-3 was reported to have no effect on SphK2 expression in the studies of Granata and co-workers (19Granata R. Trovato L. Garbarino G. Taliano M. Ponti R. Sala G. Ghidoni R. Ghigo E. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1456-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20Granata R. Trovato L. Lupia E. Sala G. Settanni F. Camussi G. Ghidoni R. Ghigo E. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 5: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and SphK1 knock-out mice do not exhibit increased expression of SphK2 in the brain or kidney (53Allende M.L. Sasaki T. Kawai H. Olivera A. Mi Y. van Echten-Deckert G. Hajdu R. Rosenbach M. Keohane C.A. Mandala S. Spiegel S. Proia R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52487-52492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Whether the differences between these studies and ours reflect cell- or tissue-specific regulation of these enzymes is not known. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that down-regulation of SphK2 may contribute further to a growth-promoting effect of IGFBP-3, as this isoform of sphingosine kinase appears to act predominantly as a growth inhibitor and inducer of apoptosis (31Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2125-2129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Elucidating the pathways and mediators of IGFBP-3 modulation of SphK expression is now an important goal of future research.A significant role for endogenous IGFBP-3 in potentiating EGFR and IGFR1 signaling is supported by our data showing that silencing of IGFBP-3 expression attenuates ligand-stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR and IGFR1. This tonic stimulatory effect of endogenous IGFBP-3 may explain, at least in part, clinical and laboratory findings of a high level of expression of IGFBP-3 associated with increased tumor size or malignancy (8Yu H.

https://openalex.org/W1985126333,"Metastatic progression of melanoma is associated with overexpression and activity of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). However, the mechanism by which CREB contributes to tumor progression and metastasis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that stably silencing CREB expression in two human metastatic melanoma cell lines, A375SM and C8161-c9, suppresses tumor growth and experimental metastasis. Analysis of cDNA microarrays revealed that CREB silencing leads to increased expression of cysteine-rich protein 61 (CCN1/CYR61) known to mediate adhesion, chemostasis, survival, and angiogenesis. Promoter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that CREB acts as a negative regulator of CCN1/CYR61 transcription by directly binding to its promoter. Re-expression of CREB in CREB-silenced cells rescued the low CCN1/CYR61 expression phenotype. CCN1/CYR61 overexpression resulted in reduced tumor growth and metastasis and inhibited the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2. Furthermore, its overexpression decreased melanoma cell motility and invasion through Matrigel, which was abrogated by silencing CCN1/CYR61 in low metastatic melanoma cells. Moreover, a significant decrease in angiogenesis as well as an increase in apoptosis was seen in tumors overexpressing CCN1/CYR61. Our results demonstrate that CREB promotes melanoma growth and metastasis by down-regulating CCN1/CYR61 expression, which acts as a suppressor of melanoma cell motility, invasion and angiogenesis.

CREB and ATF-1 belong to the leucine zipper class of transcription factors.

A number of reports have suggested that CREB is involved in melanoma progression We have demonstrated previously that quenching CREB activity in metastatic melanoma cells by means of a dominant-negative form of CREB (KCREB) leads to a decrease in their tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in nude mice (21Xie S. Price J.E. Luca M. Jean D. Ronai Z. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2069-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In that study, we identified two mechanisms by which overexpression of CREB/ATF-1 contributes to the metastatic phenotype: first, CREB/ATF-1 plays an essential role in cell invasion by regulating the CRE-dependent expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and the adhesion molecule genes MCAM/MUC18 (21Xie S.

Indeed, expression of a dominant-negative form of CREB (KCREB) in metastatic melanoma cells sensitizes them to thapsigargin-induced apoptosis (12Jean D. Harbison M. McConkey D.J. Ronai Z. Bar-Eli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24884-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In an analogous manner, intracellular expression of an inhibitory anti-ATF-1 single chain variable fragment (ScFv) antibody in MeWo melanoma cells suppresses their tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in nude mice (21Xie S. Price J.E. Luca M. Jean D. Ronai Z. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2069-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Jean D. Bar-Eli M. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 21: 275-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of ScFv anti-ATF-1 renders the melanoma cells susceptible to thapsigargin-induced apoptosis in vitro and causes massive apoptosis in tumors transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice (23Jean D. Tellez C. Huang S. Davis D.W. Bruns C.J. McConkey D.J. Hinrichs S.H. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2721-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that phosphorylation of CREB and ATF-1 can be stimulated by a bioactive lipid platelet-activating factor (PAF) in metastatic melanoma cells (17Melnikova V.O. Mourad-Zeidan A.A. Lev D.C. Bar-Eli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2911-2922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). PAF-induced CREB phosphorylation leads to the overexpression and activation of MMP-2 and membrane type 1-MMP (17Melnikova V.O. Mourad-Zeidan A.A. Lev D.C. Bar-Eli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2911-2922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In line with our observations, another study demonstrated that down-regulation of CREB expression with small interfering RNA in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells suppresses their growth by inducing apoptotic cell death (24Aggarwal S. Kim S.W. Ryu S.H. Chung W.C. Koo J.S. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanisms of CREB-induced tumor growth and metastasis and identify other proteins/factors involved in CREB-induced tumor growth and metastasis, we silenced CREB expression by stably transfecting the highly metastatic human melanoma cell lines A375SM and C8161-c9 with a lentivirus-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA). We found that CREB silencing resulted in the up-regulation of cysteine-rich protein 61 (CCN1/CYR61) expression. CCN1/CYR61 is a member of the growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene family consisting of CYR61/CCN1, connective tissue growth factor/CCN2, and nephroblastoma overexpressed/CCN3. CCN proteins have been shown to mediate functions as diverse as cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, survival, differentiation, and extracellular matrix formation (25Brigstock D.R. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 178: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). They also regulate more complex processes, such as angiogenesis and tumorigenesis (26Perbal B. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 103-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). CCN1/CYR61 was the first cloned member of the CCN family. It is a 40-kDa cysteine-rich heparin-binding protein that either localizes intracellularly or is secreted into the extracellular milieu where it associates with the extracellular matrix and cell surfaces (27Chen Y. Du X.Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 28Leask A. Abraham D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4803-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that CCN1/CYR61 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis, decreases angiogenesis, and induces apoptosis of melanoma cells in vivo. This is the first report to identify CCN1/CYR61 as a tumor suppressor in human melanoma. The A375SM human melanoma cell line was established from pooled lung metastases produced by A375-P cells injected intravenously into nude mice (29Li L. Price J.E. Fan D. Zhang R.D. Bucana C.D. Fidler I.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1989; 81: 1406-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) as described previously (30Huang S. Jean D. Luca M. Tainsky M.A. Bar-Eli M. The EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4358-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The aggressive amelanotic human melanoma cell line C8161-c9 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 (DMEM-F12) supplemented with 5% FBS as described previously (31Welch D.R. Bisi J.E. Miller B.E. Conaway D. Seftor E.A. Yohem K.H. Gilmore L.B. Seftor R.E. Nakajima M. Hendrix M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 47: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The SB-2 melanoma cell line was isolated from a primary cutaneous lesion as described previously (32Verschraegen C.F. Giovanella B.C. Mendoza J.T. Kozielski A.J. Stehlin Jr., J.S. Anticancer Res. 1991; 11: 529-535PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The 293FT cells (Invitrogen) used to produce the lentiviral shRNA were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS according to the manufacturer's instructions. CREB-targeting shRNA (CREB-shRNA) (target sequence: 5′-GAGAGAGGTCCGTCTAATG-3′), CCN1/CYR61 shRNA (target sequence: 5′-CGCATCCTATACAACCCTTTA-3′), and a nontargeting shRNA (NT-shRNA) (target sequence: 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′) were designed with a hairpin and sticky ends (ClaI and MluI) for use with the lentiviral system developed and kindly provided by Didier Trono (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland) (33Wiznerowicz M. Trono D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8957-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were annealed into the lentiviral gene transfer vector, pLVTHM, using the ClaI and MluI restriction enzyme sites. Competent Escherichia coli were transformed with the annealed lentiviral vector and grown overnight. Several bacterial colonies were then isolated and grown in Luria broth overnight. DNA was isolated from the bacterial culture using a Maxi Plasmid DNA purification kit (Qiagen). The DNA was sequenced to test for proper insertion and length of the inserts. The lentivirus was then produced by transfecting human embryonic kidney cells (293FT; Invitrogen) with the sequence-verified PLVTHM vector containing either the CREB-shRNA or the CCN1/CYR61 shRNA sequences, the packaging plasmid (MD2G), and the envelope plasmid (PAX2), which are required for viral production. Three days later, the viral supernatant was collected and filtered to remove cellular debris. To silence CREB, highly metastatic A375SM and C8161-c9 cell lines plated at 70% confluency in 6-well plates were transduced with the virus. To silence CCN1/CYR61, SB-2 cells were plated at 60% confluency in 6-well plates and transduced with the virus. After 16 h, the virus-containing medium was removed and replaced with normal growth medium. Transduced cells were sorted by green fluorescent protein. RNA (20 ng/μl) from A375SM and C8161-c9 cell lines transduced with CREB-shRNA or nontargeting (NT) shRNA were harvested using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was then made into cDNA using TaqMan reverse transcriptase reagents (Applied Biosystems). The primers and fluorescence probes were obtained from Applied Biosystems (CCN1/CYR61: Assay ID Hs00155479_m1). Reaction components for reverse transcription-PCR and amplifications were described previously (34Villares G.J. Zigler M. Wang H. Melnikova V.O. Wu H. Friedman R. Leslie M.C. Vivas-Mejia P.E. Lopez-Berestein G. Sood A.K. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 9078-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Amplifications were run in triplicates, and averages were obtained after normalization with 18s rRNA (Applied Biosystems). Data were expressed in -fold increase. The total RNA was extracted from A375SM and reverse-transcribed using a commercial kit (Clontech). The ORF of CCN1/CYR61 was PCR-amplified from the reverse transcription product with the following two primers: C61C-Xba-F, 5′-GCTCTAGAATGAGCTCCCGCATCGCCAGGG-3′ and C61C-Cla-H3-R: 5′-CCCAAGCTTATCGATTTAGTCCCTAAATTTGTGAATGTC-3′. The PCR product was digested with XbaI and HindIII and cloned into pcDNA3.1(−) through the same two restriction enzyme sites. The inserted CCN1/CYR61 ORF was confirmed by sequencing. For making the lentiviral construct the DNA fragment containing cytomegalovirus promoter and CCN1/CYR61 ORF was cut out from the above pcDNA3.1- CYR61 vector with MluI and ClaI and cloned into lentiviral vector. The recombinant lentivirus was produced with 293T according to the standard protocol. To make CCN1/CYR61 stably expressing lines, A375SM and C8161-c9 were plated in 6-well plate and transduced with the virus containing the expression vector. After 48 h, the cells were replated in growth medium containing 500 μg/ml puromycin. Two weeks later, colonies were isolated and plated into 6-well plates. The overexpression of CCN1/CYR61 was confirmed by Western blot. As control, cells were transduced with empty vector (EV). The lentiviral CREB expression vector was developed as described above. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from the A375SM cells, and the ORF of CREB was amplified by PCR from the reverse transcription product with the following two primers: CreB-XbaF, 5′-GCTCTAGAATGACCATGGAATCTGGAGCCGAG-3′ and CreB-Cla-H3R: 5′-CCCAAGCTTatcgaTTAATCTGATTTGTGGCAGTAAAG-3′. To create a nontargetable CREB expression vector we utilized the following oligonucleotides: CreB1B-ReF, 5′-GAAGCAGCACGAAAGAGAGAAGTGCGACTGATGAAGAACAGGGAAGCAG-3′; and CreB1B-ReR, 5′-CTGCTTCCCTGTTCTTCATCAGTCGCACTTCTCTCTTTCGTGCTGCTTC-3′. To rescue CREB expression in stably CREB-silenced cells, A375SM and C8161-c9 CREB-shRNA or NT-shRNA were plated in 6-well plates and transduced with the virus containing either the nontargetable CREB expression vector or empty vector. After 48 h, the cells were replated and selected as described previously. The CREB expression was confirmed by Western blot. CREB, pCREB, CCN1/CYR61, and MMP-2 were detected in total cell extracts (20 μg) by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore). The membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. The blots were then probed overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies at dilutions of 1:2000 (anti-CREB or pCREB, Cell Signaling Technology), 1:1000 (anti-CYR61, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and 1:1000 (anti-MMP-2, Cell Signaling Technology). After 2 h of incubation with horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibody, immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL detection system per the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). For detecting CCN1/CYR61 in the nuclear extract, A375SM and C8161-c9 nuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear extraction kit (Panomics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Conditioned media were collected after culturing cells in serum-free media for 48 h. The methanol precipitation method was performed with 10 ml of each sample. Briefly, 3 volumes of methanol, 1 volume of chloroform, and 4 volumes of H2O were added, mixed well, and centrifuged at maximum speed for 1 min. The upper aqueous phase was removed without disturbing the protein at the interface. Subsequently, 8 volumes of methanol were added, and the sample was vortexed to mix. Following methanol precipitation at −20 °C for 30 min, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 15 min to form protein pellets. The pellets were then air-dried and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Microarray analysis was performed using a human genome U133 Plus 2.0 array (Affymetrix). The microarrays were produced in the microarray core facility of Codon Bioscience (Houston, TX). Total RNA was isolated from NT-shRNA- and CREB-shRNA-transduced A375SM cells using the Clontech Advantage RT-for-PCR kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The data were analyzed using the Affymetrix software program as described previously (35Mourad-Zeidan A.A. Melnikova V.O. Wang H. Raz A. Bar-Eli M. Am. J. Pathol. 2008; 173: 1839-1852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The CNN1/CYR61 promoter region (nucleotides −960 to +65 from the transcription initiation site) was amplified from A375SM genomic DNA using the following primers: forward, 5′-GAAGATCTGGAGAAGGCGCGGAGGGCGC-3′; reverse, 5′- ggggtacCTCCCCGCGTTCGTTTCCTCTCG-3′. The fragment was digested with KpnI and BglII and ligated into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Analysis of transcription factor binding sites was performed using GENOMATIX software. Site-directed mutagenesis of the CRE sites, replacing CG of the GACGTCA CRE site with AT, was performed using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectin or Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In a 24-well plate, a total of 2.5 × 104 cells/well were transfected with 0.5 μg of the empty pGL3 expression vector or with 0.5 μg of the pGL3-CYR61 or pGL3-CYR61-promoter-mutant-containing firefly luciferase expression constructs. For each transfection, 2.5 ng of cytomegalovirus-driven Renilla luciferase reporter construct (pRL-CMV, Promega) was included. After 4 h, the transfection medium was replaced with serum-containing growth medium. After 48 h, the cells were harvested and lysed, and the luciferase activity was assayed utilizing a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The luciferase luminescence (relative light intensity × 106) was measured with a LUMIstar microplate reader (BMG Labtech). The ratio of firefly luciferase activity to cytomegalovirus-driven Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize any differences in transfection efficiency among samples. All constructs were fully sequenced in both directions before use. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using the ChIP-IT Express kit from Active Motif according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, and the cross-linking reaction was stopped with 0.125 m glycine. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in a hypotonic buffer, and cell nuclei were isolated using a Dounce homogenizer. The chromatin was then sheared into 200–1000-bp fragments by adding an enzymatic solution for 10 min at 37 °C. Fractions of the chromatin solutions were incubated overnight at 4 °C with either 3 μg of anti-CREB or IgG control antibodies cross-linked to magnetic beads. The immune complexes were then eluted from the magnetic beads, and proteins were reverse cross-linked at 65 °C for 2.5 h. Proteins were digested with 2 μl of proteinase K at 37 °C for 1 h, extracted in elution buffer, and analyzed by PCR. A 250-bp fragment spanning the −515 to −265 region of the CCN1/CYR61 promoter was amplified by PCR using the following primer sequences: forward, 5′-CAGATAACTTGCCTCTCACC-3′; and reverse, 5′-TACGACTTATGTTGGGAAGG-3′. The invasion assay was performed using BioCoat Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences) primed according to the manufacturer's directions. A solution of 20% FBS in DMEM-F12 or MEM was placed in the lower well to act as a chemoattractant. For experiments using A375SM or C8161-c9 cell lines, 2.5 × 103 cells in 500 μl of serum-free medium were placed in the upper chamber of the Matrigel plate and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Experiments using SB-2 cells were carried out as described previously (36Gershenwald J.E. Sumner W. Calderone T. Wang Z. Huang S. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3363-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cells on the lower surface of the filter were stained with Protocol Hema3 stain set (Fisher Scientific). Each sample was analyzed under a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope at ×10 magnification. Pictures were taken using a Leica DFC 320 R2, and images were evaluated by Photoshop. The data were expressed as the average number ± S.D. of cells from four fields that migrated to the lower surface of the filter. A375SM and C8161-c9 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and allowed to reach complete confluence. To make the wound, the growth medium was aspirated and replaced by calcium-free PBS to prevent the killing of cells at the edge of the wound caused by exposure to high calcium concentrations. Subsequently, a blue plastic P1000 pipette tip (Fisher) was used to scratch the cell monolayer to create a cleared area. The wounded cell layer was washed once with fresh medium to remove loose cells and then refed with fresh growth medium. The wounds were observed using phase contrast microscopy on an inverted microscope. Images were taking at regular intervals over the course of 12 to 48 h. Images were analyzed by digitally drawing lines (using Adobe Photoshop) and averaging the positions of the migrating cells at the wound edges. We determined the cell migration distance by measuring the width of the wound, dividing by 2, and subtracting this value from the initial half-width of the wound. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized by sequential washing with xylene, graded ethanol, and PBS. Antigen retrieval was done by heating in a steam cooker in 1× Target Retrieval Solution (Dako) for 30 min. After cooling and washing with PBS, endogenous peroxide was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxidase inhibitor in PBS for 12 min. Nonspecific proteins were blocked in 5% horse serum and 1% goat serum for 20 min. Slides were incubated with anti-MMP-2 (1:400; Chemicon) or anti-human CCN1/CYR61 (polyclonal, 1:100; Novus Biologicals) antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then with a peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. Signal was detected by staining with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Phoenix Biotechnologies) substrate for 6 min and then counterstaining with Gill's hematoxylin No. 3 (Sigma) for 20 s. For CD31 staining, frozen tissue sections were fixed by incubation with cold acetone for 5 min followed by a 1:1 mixture of acetone/chloroform and again by cold acetone for 5 min each. Nonspecific proteins were blocked in 4% fish gelatin in PBS for 20 min. Overnight incubation at 4 °C with rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody (1:800; Pharmingen) was performed followed by a 1-h incubation with goat anti-rat Alexa 594 (1:500; Invitrogen) at room temperature. After washes in PBS, the samples were counterstained with Hoechst dye (Molecular Probes) for 10 min at room temperature. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP end labeling (TUNEL) assay was done using a commercial kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol after CD31 staining. Briefly, tumor sections were rinsed with PBS and incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After two washes in PBS, the slides were incubated in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature followed by two washes in PBS. Slides were incubated with equilibration buffer for 10 min at room temperature. Tumor sections were then covered with TUNEL incubation buffer (50 μl/slide) and incubated in a humidified chamber at 4 °C overnight. The reaction was terminated by washing the slides with SSC for 15 min at room temperature followed by three washes in PBS to remove unincorporated fluorescein-dUTP. Slides were observed using a fluorescent microscope. MMP-2 activity was determined on substrate-impregnated gels as described previously (17Melnikova V.O. Mourad-Zeidan A.A. Lev D.C. Bar-Eli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2911-2922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 103 melanoma cells were plated in 6-well dishes and allowed to attach for 24 h. Then the medium (normal growth medium with 10% FBS) was removed and replaced with serum-free medium overnight. The supernatants were collected and their volumes adjusted to the cell number, and a total of 60 μl of supernatant was loaded onto a gelatin-impregnated (1 mg/ml; Sigma) 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and separated under nonreducing conditions. As a positive control, 1% FBS in normal growth medium was used. For the negative control, serum-free medium was used. Plates were shaken for 1 h in 2.5% Triton X-100 (Fisher Scientific) to remove all of the SDS from the gels. Plates were then removed, and the gels were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in 50 mmol/liter Tris, 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mmol/liter CaCl2, and 0.002% Brij 35 (w/v) at pH 7.6. At the end of the incubation, the gels were stained with 0.5% Coomassie G-250 (Bio-Rad) in methanol/acetic acid/H2O (30:"

Comparison of gene expression profiles of nonmodified human preadipocytes (n = 4) with the parallel TSHR* population revealed significant up-regulation of 27 genes including hyaluronan (HA) synthases (HAS) 1 and 2. The array data were confirmed by quantitative PCR of HAS1 and HAS2 and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurement of HA; all values were significantly increased (p < 0.03) in TSHR*-expressing preadipocytes (n = 10). Preadipocytes (n = 8) treated with dibutyryl (db)-cAMP display significantly increased HAS1 and HAS2 transcripts, HAS2 protein, and HA production (p < 0.02). HAS1 or HAS2 small interfering RNA treatment of db-cAMP-stimulated preadipocytes (n = 4) produced 80% knockdown in HAS1 or 61% knockdown in HAS2 transcripts (compared with scrambled), respectively; the corresponding HA production was reduced by 49 or 38%. Reporter assays using A293 cells transfected with HAS1 promoter-driven plasmids containing or not containing the proximal CRE and treated with db-cAMP revealed that it is functional. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, using a cAMP-responsive element-binding protein antibody, of db-cAMP-treated preadipocytes (n = 4) yielded products for HAS1 and HAS2 with relative fold increases of 3.3 ± 0.8 and 2.6 ± 0.9, respectively. HA accumulates in adipose/connective tissues of patients with thyroid dysfunction. We investigated the contributions of TSH and thyroid-stimulating antibodies and obtained small (9–24%) but significant (p < 0.02) increases in preadipocyte HA production with both ligands. Similar results were obtained with a TSHR monoclonal antibody lacking biological activity (p < 0.05). We conclude that TSHR activation is implicated in HA production in preadipocytes, which, along with thyroid hormone level variation, explains the HA overproduction in thyroid dysfunction.

HA is a ubiquitous linear polysaccharide component of the extracellular matrix, which influences cellular proliferation and migration following injury and plays an important biological role in tissue remodeling, wound healing, and the phenotypic transformation of cells (4Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). HA occupies a large hydrodynamic volume acting as a lubricant, support, and cushion in different tissues. It is synthesized on the inner surface of the plasma membrane and extruded to the extracellular matrix by three differentially regulated HAS enzymes about the control of which very little is known (5Itano N.

The skin and adipose/connective tissue of individuals with thyroid dysfunction accumulate glycosaminoglycans (GAG), predominantly HA (7Smith T.J. Bahn R.S. Gorman C.A. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 366-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). HA is hydrophilic and thus generates the widespread build-up of mucopolysaccharide that produces edema in hypothyroidism. In contrast, the deposition of HA is assumed to be more localized in hyperthyroid conditions such as Graves disease (GD) in which the orbital and pretibial regions are the most affected and can result in Graves ophthalmopathy (GO) and pretibial myxoedema, respectively (8Weetman A.P. Q. J. Med. 1993; 86: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The major cause of thyroid dysfunction is autoimmunity, and several immunomodulators, e.g. interleukin-1 and transforming growth factor β (both macrophage products), can induce/enhance HA production in vitro (9Kaback L.A. Smith T.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 4079-4084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wang H.S. Tung W.H. Tang K.T. Wong Y.K. Huang G.J. Wu J.C. Guo Y.J. Chen C.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, serum IgG from patients with GD can induce hyaluronan production in cultured GD (but not normal) fibroblasts. The effect appears to be mediated by the receptor for IGF-1 and related activating antibodies (11Smith T.J. Hoa N. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Activation of the TSHR occurs in most patients with thyroid dysfunction through thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSAB) in hyperthyroid GD or elevated TSH in hypothyroidism. In light of our array data, we hypothesize that TSAB or supraphysiological TSH target and activate the TSHR and stimulate the overproduction of HA. We report our findings on HA production in response to activation and/or cross-linking of the TSHR achieved using ligands and gain-of-function TSHR mutations naturally occurring in toxic adenoma and familial hyperthyroidism (reviewed in Ref. 12Paschke R. Ludgate M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1675-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). All of the reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and tissue culture components were from Cambrex unless otherwise stated. Adipose tissue was collected with informed consent and local research ethics committee approval from several depots: orbit (n = 12, 9 patients with GO all undergoing decompressive surgery and having inactive disease with a clinical activity score below 2) and nonorbit (n = 11, predominantly subcutaneous from patients undergoing elective open abdominal surgery for nonmetabolic conditions). Orbital preadipocytes were obtained from adipose tissue explants, and nonorbital preadipocytes were obtained by collagenase digest, both as previously described (13Zhang L. Baker G. Janus D. Paddon C. Fuhrer D. Ludgate M. Invest. Opthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 5197-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Preadipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 10% fetal calf serum (complete medium (CM)) and were used at low passage number (<6); hence not all samples were analyzed in all experiments. Activating mutant TSHR (L629F) was introduced into the various preadipocyte populations using retroviral vectors, previously produced in our laboratory (14Fuhrer D. Lewis M.D. Alkhafaji F. Starkey K. Paschke R. Wynford-Thomas D. Eggo M. Ludgate M. Endocrinology. 2006; 144: 4018-4030Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Geneticin selection resulted in mixed populations stably expressing the various TSHR, which exhibit increased basal levels of cAMP compared with the equivalent nonmodified cell population, all as previously described (13Zhang L. Baker G. Janus D. Paddon C. Fuhrer D. Ludgate M. Invest. Opthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 5197-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The nonmodified and mutant TSHR preadipocyte populations from four different individuals were cultured in CM in 10-cm Petri dishes until 90% confluent. RNA was then extracted from the cells using TRIzol reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality was verified using an Agilent bioanalyzer prior to cDNA synthesis and in vitro transcription. The resulting cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133A chips, and the data were analyzed using Affymetrix MAS 5.0 software. Following successful QC analysis, the data were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes using an unpaired Bayesian t test (15Baldi P. Long A.D. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) with a false detection rate correction (16Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. R. Stat. Soc. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar) for multiple testing. For visualization, the data were log-transformed and median-centered before hierarchical clustering and heat map visualization. The expression of gain-of-function TSHR mutation provided one method. Alternatively, ∼5 × 104 nonmodified preadipocytes were plated in 6-well plates or 60-mm dishes in CM, and when they reached 70–80% confluence were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated for 4 or 24 h with 10−3 m dibutyryl cAMP (db-cAMP). Nonmodified preadipocytes in CM were also treated for varying time periods with 1–10 milliunits/ml TSH; 1 μg/ml monoclonal TSAB (IRISAB 2*); 1 μg/ml TSHR monoclonal antibodies lacking bioactivity (3G4 and BA8*); and 1 μg/ml monoclonal antibody to human thyroid peroxidase (mAb 47). The various cell populations were plated in 6-well plates in CM, RNA was extracted following the various treatments, and 1 μg was reverse transcribed using standard protocols for QPCR analysis. Primers for the three HAS subtypes were designed using DNASTAR software to span intron-exon boundaries; details are provided in Table 1. To generate plasmid standards, PCR fragments were subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the plasmid identity was confirmed by sequencing. QPCR was conducted using SYBR Green incorporation measured on a Stratagene MX 3000. Each reaction comprised 1 μl of plasmid standard containing 106 to 102 copies, in a total volume of 25 μl. Initially the optimal primer combination, to generate a homogeneous amplification peak in the absence of primer dimers, was determined for each subtype.TABLE 1PCR primers used indicating exon location and size of ampliconForward primerReverse primerhAPRT (247 bp)GCTGCGTGCTCATCCGAAAG (exon 3)CCTTAAGCGAGGTCAGCTCC (exon 5)hHAS-1 (375 bp)AAGGCGCTCGGAGATTCGGTGGACT (exon 2)GCTGAGCATGCGGTTGGTGAGGTG (exon 4)hHAS-2 (362 bp)CTGGGACGAAGTGTGGATTATGTA (exon 2)ACCCGGTTCGTGAGATGC (exon 4)hHAS-3 (417 bp)CTCGGCCCAGCGCATCTCCTT (exon 2)ACATCTCCCCCGACTCCCCCTACT (exon 3) Open table in a new tab QPCR measurement of HAS1/2/3 transcripts in the samples used 1 μl of cDNA (of a 20-μl reverse transcription step) in the reaction. Comparison with standard curves for each subtype (included in each experiment) permitted calculation of absolute values for each sample (transcripts/μg input RNA). In addition, transcripts for a housekeeping gene, APRT, were measured so that values could be expressed relative to this (transcripts/1000 APRT). In a single QPCR experiment, all of the measurements were made in triplicate; the standard curve was also run at least in duplicate in each reaction. For all experiments to measure HA, preadipocytes were plated in CM in 6-well plates but then washed in the same medium but without fetal calf serum and incubated in this for the 24 h prior to collection. Culture supernatants from nonmodified preadipocytes (treated or not with db-cAMP or TSHR ligands) and untreated L629F-expressing preadipocytes (48 h in serum-free medium) at 70–100% confluence were collected, centrifuged to remove dead cells, and stored at −80 °C until analysis. HA was measured in neat 24-h supernatants (determined by preliminary experiments using neat, 1:10 and 1:100) using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Corgenix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. ng/104 cells. Subcutaneous preadipocytes from four individuals were cultured in 60-mm dishes until 70% confluent and treated (or not) for 24 h with 10−3 m db-cAMP. The proteins were extracted in Laemmli buffer containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The samples (containing 20 μg of protein) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as previously described (17Al-Khafaji F. Wiltshire M. Fuhrer D. Mazziotti G. Lewis M.D. Smith P.J. Ludgate M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 34: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The blots were probed with goat polyclonal antibodies to HAS1 and HAS2 from Santa Cruz (sc-23145 and sc-34067). Both antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution, and the blots were incubated at 4 °C overnight. The proteins were detected using an anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:5000, room temperature for 1 h; GE Healthcare) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus; GE Healthcare). Preadipocytes (n = 4) were plated in 60-mm dishes until 70% confluent, and 24 h before transfection they were switched to culture medium without antibiotics. The cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight in 2.5 ml of culture medium containing 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 1 μl of 100 μm HAS1, HAS2, or scrambled siRNA (Applied Biosciences) to produce a final concentration of 40 nm. At the end of the incubation the cells were washed, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and treated for 24 h with 10−3 m db-cAMP; RNA and culture supernatants were collected for QPCR and ELISA measurements. Initially HAS1 and HAS2 locus sequences were analyzed for the presence of putative transcription factor-binding sites using the updated MatInspector program from the Genomatix suite (18Cartharius K. Frech K. Grote K. Klocke B. Haltmeier M. Klingenhoff A. Frisch M. Bayerlein M. Werner T. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2933-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). The reporter assays employed three plasmids to test cAMP-mediated transactivation of HAS1. The first comprises 201 base pairs of HAS1 proximal promoter and includes the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) recognition sequence (TGACGTCA) at −128/−120; the second is identical, but the CRE has been mutated (tgacTGACGTCA to taacATACCTTA, in this modified promoter Genomatix software did not identify a CREB site, all other sites remained recognizable, and the changes created no new sites); the third comprises the proximal 108 base pairs and thus lacks the CRE. In all cases the promoter regions were cloned into the EcoRI/HindIII site of the pGL3 modified basic luciferase reporter vector as previously described (19Jenkins R.H. Thomas G.J. Williams J.D. Steadman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41453-41460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, the pSVβgal (Promega) plasmid was incorporated to control for transfection efficiency. Transcriptional response to cAMP was assessed in several different cell types including A293, COS, and C2C, all plated at 1 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. All of the cell types were transfected with 500 ng of luciferase reporter and 100 ng of β-galactosidase reporter using TransfastTM transfection reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h in serum-free medium, the cells were treated for 4 or 24 h with 10−5 m forskolin ± 10−4 m isobutylmethylxanthine or 10−4 m dibutyryl cAMP; 24 h later the cells were lysed in 120 μl/well lysis buffer (Promega). To measure β-galactosidase, 50 μl of cell lysate was transferred to a clear 96-well plate and incubated with an equal volume of ice-cold assay buffer (120 mm Na2HPO4·12H2O, 80 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1.33 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, pH 7.5) at room temperature for 30 min, and the absorbance was read at 420 nm using an ELISA plate reader. the results are expressed in optical density units. The luciferase activity in a 50 μl of cell lysate was determined using Promega's dual luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions and was measured on an automatic luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; TR717). The results are expressed in relative light units. The final results are expressed as corrected relative light units, i.e. normalization of luciferase values to β-galactosidase activity (relative light units/optical density unit). Individual experiments were all performed in triplicate. Preadipocytes (n = 3) were cultured in 100-mm dishes in CM until they reached 80% confluence. They were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated or not for 4 h with 10−3 m dibutyryl cAMP. Chromatin was prepared, and ChIP assays were performed using the EpiQuick ChIP kit (Epigentek) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. The cross-linked nuclear extracts were sonicated to obtain small length DNA fragments ranging from 200 to 800 bp. A polyclonal antibody to CREB (sc-186x; Santa Cruz) was used for the immunoprecipitation. The human HAS1 promoter CRE site (−128/−120) was analyzed by PCR amplification; the following primers were used: HAS-1F (76-bp fragment immediately adjacent to CRE), CCCGCCTGCGCTGGTCTTCA; and HAS-1R, CTCTCCGGCTTGCTCTCC. The human HAS2 promoter (−664/−656) full site CRE was analyzed using the following primers: HAS-2F (113-bp fragment spanning CRE), ACGGCAGAAACCTCTTTATGA; and HAS-2R, TCTAAAAAGATCGCGGTGGT. The data were analyzed using the Bayesian t test with false detection rate correction, Wilcoxon signed ranks test, or Student's t test. In all cases p < 0.05 was considered significant. The statistical analysis applied is indicated in the table/figure legends. To investigate a possible role for TSHR activation in the lineage-specific differentiation of adipose-derived precursors, we compared the gene expression profiles (Fig. 1) of control (empty vector) subcutaneous preadipocytes from four individuals with the same populations expressing L629F TSHR. After applying stringent statistical methods (Bayesian t test with false detection rate correction) to account for the high degree of intrasample variation, only 48 genes remained whose expression was significantly different between the two. HAS1 and HAS2 were among the 27 genes whose expression was significantly up-regulated (3.3- and 1.5-fold, respectively) in the L629F populations. To confirm the array data, a further 10 preadipocyte samples (predominantly subcutaneous) were then analyzed using QPCR for HAS isoform transcript measurement and ELISA to quantify HA production. The results are summarized in Table 2. In all of the samples analyzed, the APRT housekeeper “crossing the threshold” (Ct) values were in the region of 20–21. HAS1 Ct values were much higher (27Stair-Nawy S. Csóka A.B. Stern R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Crisp M. Starkey K.J. Lane C.

Because no significant differences were observed between nonmodified preadipocytes or the same cells transduced with the empty vector (data not shown), both populations provided adequate controls. Activation of the TSHR, as in the L629F expressing cells, induces signaling via the cAMP cascade. Consequently we used db-cAMP to investigate whether the observed increases were indeed caused by elevated cAMP; the results are shown in Fig. 2. Treatment of nonmodified preadipocytes with 10−3 m db-cAMP (n = 8) for 4 h significantly increased HAS1 TCN (p < 0.02) and HAS2 TCN (p < 0.008). When treatment was for 24 h, there were significant increases in HAS1 TCN (p < 0.05), HAS2 TCN (p < 0.008), and HA by ELISA (p < 0.0001). HAS3 TCN were not significantly modified by the treatment (data not shown). To determine whether the db-cAMP treatment had induced an equivalent increase in HAS1 and HAS2 proteins in the preadipocytes, Western blot analysis was attempted. When probing with an antibody to HAS1, the protein bands corresponding to the expected Mr were at the limit of detection and impossible to quantify. The HAS2 antibody produced a strong signal with a protein of apparent molecular mass 53 kDa, and densitometry, used to produce a ratio of HAS2 (53 kDa):actin (n = 4), revealed that its expression was increased from 7.6 ± 0.35 to 9.6 ± 0.98 (p < 0.03, Student's) by treatment with the cAMP mimetic. A protein at 63 kDa was also increased by db-cAMP but was at the limit of detection. A representative blot is shown in Fig. 3. In view of the lack of protein expression data for HAS1, we then applied HAS1 siRNA to subcutaneous preadipocytes from four individuals. In basal conditions, 40 nm HAS1 siRNA produced a 58% reduction in transcripts for HAS1 (p < 0.03), a 52% increase in HAS2 (p < 0.04), and no change in secreted HA (Fig. 4A). When the cells were stimulated with 10−3 m db-cAMP, HAS1 siRNA produced an 80% reduction in transcripts for HAS1 (p < 0.0005), no change in HAS2, and a 49% reduction in HA (p < 0.007) in the culture medium (Fig. 4B). Equivalent experiments using HAS2 siRNA produced a 56% reduction in transcripts for HAS2, a 60% increase in HAS1 transcripts, and a 70% reduction in secreted HA (all p < 0.05) in basal conditions (Fig. 4C). In db-cAMP stimulated cells HAS2 siRNA resulted in a 61% decrease in HAS2 transcripts accompanied by a 38% reduction in secreted HA (both p < 0.05) but did not affect HAS1 transcript levels (Fig. 4D). The proximal promoter of HAS1 (a tata-less gene) has a perfect full site consensus CRE (TGACGTCA) at position −128/−120 relative to the transcription start site; there are also two half-sites further upstream. The HAS2 promoter also contains a full site CRE at −656 (and half-sites at −892, −2751 and −5305) relative to the transcription start site, but unlike the full CRE in the HAS1 promoter, this is not predicted to be functional (20Conkright M.D. Guzmán E. Flechner L. Su A.I. Hogenesch J.B. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1101-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments used a reporter construct in which luciferase is under the control of the proximal 201 bp of HAS1 promoter, containing the intact CRE, which was transfected into four different cell types (COS, HepG2, C2C, and A293). The only cell type to produce any increase in light output when treated with db-cAMP or forskolin was the A293. Consequently they were selected for further study. Subsequent experiments employed the same construct in addition to several controls; these were the empty pGL3 vector, the proximal HAS1 promoter from −108 (lacks the CRE), and the proximal HAS1 promoter from −201 in which the CRE had been mutated by site-directed mutagenesis. A representative experiment shown in Fig. 5 illustrates two points: 1) that significant increases in light output were observed only in the presence of an intact CRE and a cAMP mimetic and 2) that the −201 promoter containing an intact CRE contains elements necessary for basal transcription of the HAS1 gene. A similar 2–3-fold increase in light output was obtained using 10−5 m forskolin, but again only in A293 cells transfected with the construct in which the CRE was intact (data not shown). To determine whether the CRE is functional in vivo, we then undertook chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments on preadipocytes treated for 4 h with 10−3 m db-cAMP, using an antibody to CRE binding protein, CREB. Subsequent amplification (QPCR) of the HAS1 promoter CRE region using primers immediately adjacent to the CRE (amplicon size 76bp) produced a relative fold increase of 3.3 ± 0.8 (n = 3). In contrast, no PCR products were detected when using the primer pair designed to produce a larger amplicon (287 bp) flanking the CRE. Fig. 6A shows a representative example of the 76-bp amplicons obtained. For completeness we also examined the HAS2 promoter. There was a relative fold increase of 2.6 ± 0.9 (n = 3) when using a primer pair that covers the −664/−656 full site CRE. The primers produced an amplicon of 113 bp, as illustrated in Fig. 6B. No consistent PCR products were obtained using primer pairs just upstream of the −664/−656 full site or in the region of the intronic CRE or −5305, −2754, and −892 half-site CREs in the HAS2 promoter. The experiments performed thus far have either introduced constitutively active TSHR or biochemical reagents to increase intracellular cAMP, both of which target the entire preadipocyte population. To mimic the in vivo situation existing in patients with thyroid dysfunction, in which a small proportion of cells express the TSHR, we investigated the effects of physiological (TSH) and pathological (TSAB) TSHR ligands in subcutaneous preadipocytes from seven individuals. The results are summarized in Table 3; small but significant inc"
https://openalex.org/W2170397837,"We identified small-molecule dimer disruptors that inhibit an essential dimeric protease of human Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) by screening an alpha-helical mimetic library. Next, we synthesized a second generation of low-micromolar inhibitors with improved potency and solubility. Complementary methods including size exclusion chromatography and 1H-13C HSQC titration using selectively labeled 13C-Met samples revealed that monomeric protease is enriched in the presence of inhibitor. 1H-15N HSQC titration studies mapped the inhibitor binding site to the dimer interface, and mutagenesis studies targeting this region were consistent with a mechanism where inhibitor binding prevents dimerization through the conformational selection of a dynamic intermediate. These results validate the interface of herpesvirus proteases and other similar oligomeric interactions as suitable targets for the development of small-molecule inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2075437564,"BCL-2 family proteins regulate apoptotic cell death. BCL-2 proteins localize to intracellular membranes such as endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, and some family members translocate from the cytoplasm to mitochondria following a cell death stimulus. The prototypical family member Bcl-2 was originally identified at chromosome translocation breakpoints in human follicular lymphoma and was subsequently shown to promote tumorigenesis by inhibiting cell death rather than by promoting cell-cycle progression.

BCL-2 family proteins have traditionally been classified according to their function and their BCL-2 homology (BH) motifs. The general categories include multidomain antiapoptotic proteins (BH1-BH4), multidomain proapoptotic proteins (BH1-BH3), and proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (see Table 1). In the traditional view, anti-death BCL-2 family members in healthy cells hold pro-death BCL-2 family members in check. Upon receiving a death stimulus, BH3-only proteins inactivate the protective BCL-2 proteins, forcing them to release their pro-death partners. These pro-death BCL-2 family proteins homo-oligomerize to create pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane, resulting in cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm, which leads to caspase activation and cell death. An alternative model suggests that anti-death BCL-2 proteins bind and inhibit a subset of BH3-only proteins (e.g., BID) that otherwise directly induce the oligomerization of BAX or BAK. However, not all available data are consistent with these models, and some family members appear to lack cell death regulatory functions. Therefore, BCL-2 family proteins can also be classified based on their amino acid similarities and three-dimensional structures (see Table 2). Growing attention is being paid to alternative mechanisms of action for BCL-2 family proteins, including the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, autophagy, energetics, and other functions.

BH Family Proteins–Structural Classification



There are three BCL-2-related proteins in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, including CED-9, EGL-1, and CED-13. CED-9 is required for survival, inhibits CED-4-mediated activation of CED-3 (a caspase), and is inhibited by the BH3-only proteins EGL-1 and CED-13 during cell death; CED-9 can exhibit pro-death activity and may regulate mitochondrial dynamics. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster encodes two BCL-2 family proteins. The functions of these in cell death are uncertain.

Viral BCL-2-like proteins are encoded by different types of DNA viruses, including examples not listed. Many viral BCL-2-like proteins inhibit apoptotic cell death, but others may alter their animal hosts and host cells during the course of infection by alternative functions.

Protease cleavage sites have been identified in the N-terminal regions of a number of BCL-2 family proteins, including BCL-2, BCL-xL, MCL-1, BAX, BID (cleaved to generate truncated tBID with exposed BH3 domain), and BAD. Cleavage may inactivate anti-death activity or activate pro-death activity.

Three-dimensional structures for all indicated proteins are found at the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do) as are additional domain structures for BAD, BNIP3L, and Beclin. Other available structures include a BH3 motif in Beclin/Atg6/Vps30 binding to the cleft of BCL-2 and a structure of the viral gHV68 BCL-2 homolog M11. BNIP3 belongs to a different protein family."
https://openalex.org/W1983388502,"Activation of STAT proteins by cytokines is initiated by their Src homology 2 domain-mediated association with phosphotyrosine residues from the cytoplasmic domain of a receptor. Here, we show that the C terminus of the interleukin-22 receptor (IL-22R) recruits in a tyrosine-independent manner the coiled-coil domain of STAT3. Mutation of all IL-22R cytoplasmic tyrosines did not abolish activation of STAT3, in contrast to that of STAT1 and STAT5. Coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments showed that the coiled-coil domain of STAT3 is constitutively associated with the C-terminal part of IL-22R, and a chimeric STAT3-STAT5 protein containing the coiled-coil domain of STAT3 could be activated by this tyrosine-independent mechanism. Deletion of the C-terminal part of IL-22R dramatically decreased its ability to activate STAT3 and to mediate IL-22 activity in cell lines, demonstrating that preassociation of STAT3 with this cytokine receptor, independent from the interaction between the Src homology 2 domain and phosphotyrosines, is required for its full activity."
https://openalex.org/W2090879617,"The Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) has been shown to bind directly to cytoplasmic domains of some G protein-coupled receptors, including the dopamine D2 receptor. CaM binds to the N-terminal portion of the long third intracellular loop of the D2 receptor, within an Arg-rich epitope that is also involved in the binding to Gi/o proteins and to the adenosine A2A receptor, with the formation of A2A-D2 receptor heteromers. In the present work, by using proteomics and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) techniques, we provide evidence for the binding of CaM to the A2A receptor. By using BRET and sequential resonance energy transfer techniques, evidence was obtained for CaM-A2A-D2 receptor oligomerization. BRET competition experiments indicated that, in the A2A-D2 receptor heteromer, CaM binds preferentially to a proximal C terminus epitope of the A2A receptor. Furthermore, Ca2+ was found to induce conformational changes in the CaM-A2A-D2 receptor oligomer and to selectively modulate A2A and D2 receptor-mediated MAPK signaling in the A2A-D2 receptor heteromer. These results may have implications for basal ganglia disorders, since A2A-D2 receptor heteromers are being considered as a target for anti-parkinsonian agents. The Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) has been shown to bind directly to cytoplasmic domains of some G protein-coupled receptors, including the dopamine D2 receptor. CaM binds to the N-terminal portion of the long third intracellular loop of the D2 receptor, within an Arg-rich epitope that is also involved in the binding to Gi/o proteins and to the adenosine A2A receptor, with the formation of A2A-D2 receptor heteromers. In the present work, by using proteomics and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) techniques, we provide evidence for the binding of CaM to the A2A receptor. By using BRET and sequential resonance energy transfer techniques, evidence was obtained for CaM-A2A-D2 receptor oligomerization. BRET competition experiments indicated that, in the A2A-D2 receptor heteromer, CaM binds preferentially to a proximal C terminus epitope of the A2A receptor. Furthermore, Ca2+ was found to induce conformational changes in the CaM-A2A-D2 receptor oligomer and to selectively modulate A2A and D2 receptor-mediated MAPK signaling in the A2A-D2 receptor heteromer. These results may have implications for basal ganglia disorders, since A2A-D2 receptor heteromers are being considered as a target for anti-parkinsonian agents. G-protein-coupled receptors are able to form homo- and hetero-oligomers with unique biochemical and functional characteristics (1Agnati L.F. Ferré S. Lluis C. Franco R. Fuxe K. Pharmacol.

In view of the well known role of dopamine in Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction, it has been suggested that the A2A-D2 receptor interactions in the central nervous system may provide new therapeutic approaches to combat these disorders (16Ferré S.

An epitope-epitope electrostatic interaction between an Arg-rich epitope of the N terminus of the third intracellular loop (3IL) of the D2 receptor and an epitope containing a phosphorylated Ser localized in the distal part of the C terminus of the A2A receptor is involved in A2A-D2 receptor heteromer interface (14Ciruela F.

The same Arg-rich epitope of the D2 receptor is able to interact with CaM (22Bofill-Cardona E. Kudlacek O. Yang Q. Ahorn H. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32672-32680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Liu Y. Buck D.C. Macey T.A. Lan H. Neve K.A. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct.

In the absence of phosphorylated residues, adjacent aspartates or glutamates, which are abundant in CaM, may also form non-covalent complexes with Arg-rich epitopes (26Woods A.S. Huestis M.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 12: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, CaM can potentially convey a Ca2+ signal to the D2 receptor through direct binding to the 3IL of the D2 receptor (22Bofill-Cardona E. Kudlacek O. Yang Q. Ahorn H. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32672-32680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry data have shown that bovine CaM can form multiple non-covalent complexes with an Arg-rich peptide corresponding to the N-terminal region of the 3IL of the D2 receptor (VLRRRRKRVN) (24Woods A.S. Marcellino D. Jackson S.N. Franco R. Ferré S. Agnati L.F. Fuxe K. J. Proteome Res. 2008; 7: 3428-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) as well as a peptide from the proximal C terminus of the A2A receptor (24Woods A.S. Marcellino D. Jackson S.N. Franco R. Ferré S. Agnati L.F. Fuxe K. J. Proteome Res. 2008; 7: 3428-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This epitope, whose sequence is 291RIREFRQTFR300 in the human A2A receptor, also contains several Arg residues. Since the suspected interaction between the A2A receptor and CaM was awaiting confirmation by assays using complete proteins, the present study was undertaken to demonstrate the existence of interactions between the A2A receptor and CaM both in a recombinant protein expression cell system and in the brain. A proteomics approach was used for the discovery of protein-protein interactions between the A2A receptor and CaM in rat brain, whereas BRET in transfected cells demonstrated a direct interaction between CaM and this receptor. Furthermore, by using BRET and sequential resonance energy transfer (SRET) techniques and analyzing MAPK signaling in transfected cells, evidence was obtained for CaM-A2A-D2 receptor oligomerization and a selective Ca2+-mediated modulation of A2A and D2 receptor function in the A2A-D2 receptor heteromer. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 g) were obtained from Harlan (Barcelona, Spain). Procedures involving animals were in accordance with the guidelines established by the normative of the European Council (86/609/EEC). The experimental design was approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Testing of the University of Navarra (060/07). Animals were killed by decapitation, and the brains were rapidly removed. To obtain P2 membrane proteins, the striatum was dissected out and homogenized with a glass-Teflon homogenizer in ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7,4), 2 mm EDTA, and complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After spinning at 1,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 15 min to yield the crude membrane pellet (P2). The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer and spun again at 200,000 × g to yield washed crude membrane pellet (P2′). The pellet containing membrane proteins (P2′) was solubilized in immunoprecipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), complete protease inhibitor mixture, and 1% Igepal Ca-630 (Sigma)) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). A total amount of 0.5 mg of protein was used for immunoprecipitation. Samples were pretreated with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) with gentle rocking for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 × g to remove the beads. Membrane proteins were incubated with 5 μg of polyclonal anti A2A receptor (Affinity Bioreagents, bioNova Científica, Madrid, Spain) or with 5 μg of normal rabbit IgG (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) for 90 min, and then 30 μl of Protein A/G beads were added and left for 16 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed in the Proteomic Laboratory of CIMA. Briefly, proteins were eluted by incubation with 100 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.5) for 10 min at room temperature with gentle rocking. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant content was precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min at 4 °C. After spinning at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the pellet was washed twice with precooled acetone, completely dried in a SpeedVac, and resuspended in 30 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Proteins were reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 56 °C, alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide for 20 min in darkness, and finally digested with trypsin 1:50 (v/v) for 16 h at 37 °C. Peptide mass fingerprinting was obtained from tryptic digests by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analysis (27Muñoz J. Fernández-Irigoyen J. Santamaría E. Parbel A. Obeso J. Corrales F.J. Proteomics. 2008; 8: 1898-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A peak list was generated by ProteinLynx Global Server 2.1 (Waters, Milford, MA). A data base search was done with ProteinLynx Global Server 2.1 (Waters) and Phenyx for raw data and mzXML data, respectively. The data base used in this study was SwissProt. HEK-293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (all supplements were from Invitrogen). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and were passaged when they were 80–90% confluent (i.e. approximately twice per week). The sequence R291IREFR296QTFR300 in the C-terminal domain of the human A2A receptor was mutated to A291IREFA296QTFA300 by site-directed mutagenesis (Cellogenetics, Ijamsville, MD). The human cDNAs for A2A, mutant A2A, which is denoted as A2ARAAA, D2, and A1 receptors, cloned into pcDNA3.1, were amplified without their stop codons using sense and antisense primers harboring unique EcoRI and BamHI sites to clone A2A receptor, mutant A2A receptor, or A1 receptor in Rluc vector and EcoRI and KpnI to clone D2 receptor in Rluc or EYFP vectors. The amplified fragments were subcloned to be in frame into restriction sites of pcDNA3.1Rluc and pEYFP-N1 (enhanced yellow variant of GFP; Clontech) vectors, resulting in the plasmids A2ARRluc, A2ARAAARluc, A1RRluc, D2RRluc, and D2RYFP. The cDNA encoding the human EYFP-CaM (CaMYFP) fusion protein was kindly provided by Dr. Carles Enrich (Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Spain). CaM was subsequently subcloned into the pGFP2-C1 (BioSignal Packard, Montreal, Canada) using EcoRI and BamHI, resulting in the GFP2-CaM plasmid. The cDNA encoding the 5HT2BR-YFP fusion protein was kindly provided by Dr. Irma Nardi (University of Pisa, Italy). Expression of constructs was tested by confocal microscopy (see “Results”), and the receptor functionality was tested by second messengers, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and cAMP production, as described previously (12Canals M. Marcellino D. Fanelli F. Ciruela F. de Benedetti P. Goldberg S.R. Neve K. Fuxe K. Agnati L.F. Woods A.S. Ferré S. Lluis C. Bouvier M. Franco R. J. Biol.

HEK-293T cells growing in 6-well dishes were transiently transfected with the corresponding fusion protein cDNA by the polyethyleneimine (Sigma) method. Cells were incubated (4 h) with the corresponding cDNA together with polyethyleneimine (5 μl/μg cDNA of 10 μm polyethyleneimine) and 150 mm NaCl in a serum-free medium. After 4 h, the medium was changed to a fresh complete culture medium. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice in quick succession in HBSS with 10 mm glucose, detached by scraping, and resuspended in the same buffer unless otherwise indicated. To control the cell number, sample protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as the standard protein. Cell suspensions (20 μg of protein) in HBSS buffer containing 1.26 mm CaCl2 or, when indicated, in Ca2+-free HBSS buffer were distributed into 96-well microplates; black plates with a transparent bottom were used for fluorescence determinations, whereas white plates were used for BRET and SRET experiments. HEK-293T cells were transiently co-transfected with the indicated amounts of plasmid cDNAs corresponding to the indicated fusion proteins (see figure legends). To quantify fluorescence proteins, cells (20 μg of protein) were distributed in 96-well microplates (black plates with a transparent bottom), and fluorescence was read at 400 nm in a Fluo Star Optima Fluorimeter (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) equipped with a high energy xenon flash lamp, using a 10-nm bandwidth excitation filter. Receptor fluorescence expression was determined as fluorescence of the sample minus the fluorescence of cells expressing protein-Rluc alone. For BRET measurements, the equivalent of 20 μg of cell protein was distributed in 96-well microplates (Corning 3600, white plates; Sigma), and 5 μm coelenterazine H (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was added. After 1 min of adding coelenterazine H, the readings were collected using a Mithras LB 940, which allows the integration of the signals detected in the 485-nm short (440–500 nm) and the 530-nm long (510–590 nm) wavelength filters. To quantify receptor-Rluc expression, luminescence readings were performed after 10 min of adding 5 μm coelenterazine H. The same protocol was used to determine BRET with membranes obtained from cells (48 h post-transfection) disrupted using a Polytron homogenizer (PTA 20 TS rotor, setting 3; Kinematica, Basel, Switzerland). Disruption was performed for three 5-s periods in 10 volumes of free Ca2+ HBSS, pH 7.4, containing a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell debris were eliminated, membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 105,000 × g (40 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended and recentrifuged under the same conditions. The net BRET is defined as (long wavelength emission/short wavelength emission) − Cf, where Cf corresponds to long wavelength emission/short wavelength emission for the Rluc construct expressed alone in the same experiment. HEK-293T cells were transiently co-transfected with the indicated amounts of plasmid cDNAs, corresponding to the indicated fusion proteins (see the legend for Fig. 6). Using aliquots of transfected cells (20 μg of protein), three different determinations were performed in parallel. First, we performed quantification of protein-YFP expression by determination of the fluorescence due to protein-YFP. Cells distributed into 96-well microplates (black plates with a transparent bottom) were read in a Fluostar Optima fluorimeter (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) equipped with a high energy xenon flash lamp, using an excitation filter at 485 nm and 10-nm bandwidth emission filters corresponding to 510 nm (506–515 nm) (Ch1) and 530 nm (527–536 nm) (Ch2). The contribution of the GFP2 and YFP proteins alone to the two detection channels (spectral signature) (28Zimmermann T. Rietdorf J. Girod A. Georget V. Pepperkok R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) was measured in experiments with cells expressing only one of these proteins and normalized to the sum of the signal obtained in the two detection channels. The spectral signatures of the different receptors fused to either GFP2 or YFP did not vary significantly from the determined spectral signatures of the fluorescent proteins alone. For protein-YFP expression quantification, linear unmixing was done taking into account the spectral signature as described by Zimmermann et al. (28Zimmermann T. Rietdorf J. Girod A. Georget V. Pepperkok R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 29Carriba P. Navarro G. Ciruela F. Ferré S. Casadó V. Agnati L. Cortés A. Mallol J. Fuxe K. Canela E.I. Lluís C. Franco R. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) to separate the two emission spectra; the sample fluorescence is the fluorescence calculated as described minus the fluorescence of cells expressing only protein-Rluc and protein-GFP2. Second, we performed quantification of protein-Rluc expression by determination of the luminescence due to protein-Rluc. Cells were distributed in 96-well microplates (Corning 3600), and luminescence was determined 10 min after the addition of 5 μm coelenterazine H in a Mithras LB 940 multimode reader (Berthold Technologies, DLReady, Germany). Third, we performed SRET2 measurements. Cells were distributed in 96-well microplates (Corning 3600), and 5 μm DeepBlueC (Molecular Probes) was added. The SRET2 signal was collected using a Mithras LB 940 reader with detection filters for short wavelength (400 nm (370–450 nm)) and long wavelength (530 nm (510–590 nm)). By analogy with BRET, net SRET is defined as (long wavelength emission/short wavelength emission) − Cf, where Cf corresponds to long wavelength emission/short wavelength emission for cells expressing protein-Rluc, protein-GFP2, and the other protein partner not fused to a fluorescence protein (similar values were obtained measuring Cf in cells expressing protein-Rluc only and protein-GFP2). Linear unmixing was done for SRET2 quantification, taking into account the spectral signature (28Zimmermann T. Rietdorf J. Girod A. Georget V. Pepperkok R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) to separate the two fluorescence emission spectra. For immunocytochemistry, transiently transfected HEK-293T cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm glycine (buffer A) to quench the aldehyde groups. Then, after permeabilization with buffer A containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, cells were treated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After 1 h at room temperature, protein-Rluc was labeled with the primary mouse monoclonal anti-Rluc antibody (1:100; Chemicon, Billerica, MA) for 1 h, washed, and stained with the secondary antibody Cy3 donkey anti-mouse (1:100; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). CaMYFP was detected by its fluorescence properties. Samples were rinsed and observed in a Leica SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). Cells were grown in 25-cm2 flasks to 80% confluence and cultured in serum-free medium for 16 h before the addition of any agent. Cells resuspended in HBSS buffer containing 1.26 mm CaCl2 were treated or not with 1 μm ionomycin for 3 min before the addition of the following agonists: A2A receptor agonist CGS2168 (200 nm), the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole (1 μm), or a mixture of both ligands for 5 min. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 45 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μm phenyl-arsine oxide, 0.4 mm NaVO4, and protease inhibitor mixture). The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the protein was quantified by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin dilutions as a standard. To determine the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, equivalent amounts of protein (10 μg) were separated by electrophoresis on a denaturing 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were then probed with a mouse anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (1:2500; Sigma). In order to rule out the possibility that the differences observed were due to the application of unequal amounts of lysates, polyvinylidene difluoride blots were stripped and probed with a rabbit anti-ERK1/2 antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated ERK1/2 (1:40,000; Sigma). Bands were visualized by the addition of anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Sigma) secondary antibodies, respectively, and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Band densities were quantified with a LAS-3000 imaging system (Fujifilm), and the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 isoforms was normalized for differences in loading using the total ERK protein band intensities. Quantitative analysis of detected bands was performed by Image Gauge version 4.0 software. One-way analysis of variance and Student's t test for unpaired samples were used for statistical comparisons. According to the CaM target data base (available on the World Wide Web), the sequence RIREFRQTFR, which is present in the proximal part of the C terminus of the A2A receptor, has a high probability to bind to CaM. In fact, we recently demonstrated that a synthetic peptide with the same sequence forms non-covalent complexes with bovine CaM (24Woods A.S. Marcellino D. Jackson S.N. Franco R. Ferré S. Agnati L.F. Fuxe K. J. Proteome Res. 2008; 7: 3428-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A proteomics approach was then used to find in situ evidence of direct interactions between the A2A receptor and CaM in the brain. Samples from rat striatal membranes were immunoprecipitated using an antibody directed against a synthetic peptide of the A2A receptor C terminus, SHGDMGLPDVELLSHELK, which does not overlap with the putative CaM-binding motif. Co-immunoprecipitates were digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Among other peptides, two corresponding to the sequence of rat CaM (P62161) were detected after co-immunoprecipitation with the specific polyclonal antibody but not with rabbit IgG (Table 1). The significance of the hits was confirmed by the low p values for both the 13-mer and the 9-mer peptides, which collectively covered 15% of the rat CaM sequence (Table 1). These results suggest that CaM and the A2A receptor may interact, but the existence of a third bridging protein cannot be ruled out. For this purpose, BRET assays were performed in cells transfected with the cDNAs for the A2ARRluc and CaMYFP fusion proteins. The hyperbola obtained upon increasing the YFP/Rluc ratio (Fig. 1A) indicates that a specific interaction between CaM and the A2A receptor can occur in living cells. Similar experiments were performed using D2RRluc and CaMYFP to confirm that these two proteins may establish direct molecular interactions (Fig. 1B). The specificity of the CaM and A2A receptor or CaM and D2 receptor interactions in HEK cells was confirmed by the nonspecific (linear) BRET signal obtained when assaying A1RRluc and CaMYFP (Fig. 1).

https://openalex.org/W2087181092,"The cGMP-stimulated PDE2A hydrolyzes both cyclic nucleotides, cGMP and cAMP. Three splice variants have been cloned from several species. Whereas PDE2A1 is soluble, PDE2A2 and PDE2A3 are membrane-bound enzymes of rat and bovine origin, respectively. To date it is unclear whether one species expresses all three variants. The splice variants only differ in their N termini, which likely determine the subcellular localization. However, the mechanism for membrane attachment remains unknown. Here, we show that myristoylation underlies membrane targeting of PDE2A3. The myristoylated enzyme was bound to plasma membranes, whereas mutation of the myristoyl recipient Gly2 prevented incorporation of [3H]myristate and turned PDE2A3 completely soluble. Additionally, Cys5 and to a minor extent Cys11 are required for targeting of PDE2A3. Substitution of the putatively palmitoylated cysteines partially solubilized the enzyme and led to an accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi compartment, as shown by fluorescence microscopy in HEK 293 and PC12 cells. In vivo, PDE2A is expressed in many tissues. By using newly generated antibodies selectively detecting the splice variants PDE2A3 or PDE2A1, respectively, we demonstrate on the protein level PDE2A3 expression in mouse brain where it is entirely membrane-associated and a widespread expression of soluble PDE2A1 in mouse tissues. We show that PDE2A localizes to synaptosomal membranes and in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons partially overlaps with the presynaptic marker synaptophysin as demonstrated by immunofluorescence. In sum, these results demonstrate dual acylation as mechanism targeting neuronal PDE2A3 to synapses thereby ensuring local control of cyclic nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1977065670,"The chemokine decoy receptor D6 controls inflammatory responses by selective recognition and degradation of most CCR1 to CCR5 agonistic ligands. CCL14 is a homeostatic chemokine present at high concentrations in the serum with a weak agonist activity on CCR1. Under inflammatory conditions, plasmin and UPA-mediated truncation of 8 amino acids generates the potent CCR1/CCR3/CCR5 isoform CCL14(9–74), which is further processed and inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase IV/CD26 that generates CCL14(11–74). Here we report that D6 efficiently binds both CCL14 and its truncated isoforms. Like other D6 ligands, the biologically active CCL14(9–74) induces adaptive up-regulation of D6 expression on the cell membrane and is rapidly and efficiently degraded. In contrast, the D6-mediated degradation of the biologically inactive isoforms CCL14(1–74) and CCL14(11–74) is very inefficient. Thus, D6 cooperates with CD26 in the negative regulation of CCL14 by the selective degradation of its biologically active isoform. Analysis of a panel of CC chemokines and their truncated isoforms revealed that D6-mediated chemokine degradation does not correlate with binding affinity. Conversely, degradation efficiency is positively correlated with D6 adaptive up-regulation.

Chemokines can be classified according to the number and relative position of cysteine residues in the N terminus into four classes (C, CC, CXC, and CX3C).

Chemokine extracellular processing has complex effects on the chemokine biology, in that it usually results in biological inactivation, but for some chemokines, processing increases the biological activity or receptor specificity rather then resulting in biological inactivation (8Mortier A.

Chemokine processing plays a unique role for a CC chemokine subfamily with an extended N-terminal domain that has to be cleaved in order to activate the molecules (23Forssmann U. Mägert H.J. Adermann K. Escher S.E. Forssmann W.G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 357-366PubMed Google Scholar, 24Berahovich R.D. Miao Z. Wang Y. Premack B. Howard M.C. Schall T.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7341-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This chemokine subfamily includes CCL14, CCL15, and CCL23 in humans, clustered in an identical orientation within a region spanning ∼40 kbp of chromosome 17q11.2. Although they lack murine homologues, the murine CCL6 and CCL9 chemokines have been identified as murine orthologues of the human CCL15 and CCL23, respectively (23Forssmann U. Mägert H.J. Adermann K. Escher S.E. Forssmann W.G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 357-366PubMed Google Scholar). The best known member of this subfamily is CCL14, also named plasmatic hemofiltrate CC chemokine 1 (25Schulz-Knappe P. Mägert H.J. Dewald B. Meyer M. Cetin Y. Kubbies M. Tomeczkowski J. Kirchhoff K.

Upon removal of the first 8 amino acid residues from the N terminus of CCL14 by urokinase plasminogen activator and/or plasmin, the prochemokine is converted into CCL14(9–74), a potent agonist for CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 (26Vakili J.

Interestingly, the new N terminus is now recognized and processed by the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (CD26), which further cleaves 2 amino acids and generates the biologically inactive CCL14(11–74) variant (29Forssmann U. Hartung I. Bälder R. Fuchs B. Escher S.E. Spodsberg N. Dulkys Y. Walden M. Heitland A. Braun A. Forssmann W.G. Elsner J. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3456-3466Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To characterize the interplay between these two posttranslational regulatory mechanisms of chemokine activity, in this study we analyzed the D6 interaction properties of full-length and truncated isoforms of this subfamily of CC chemokines. Results indicate that although D6 binds the three CCL14 isoforms, it is able to efficiently degrade only the biologically active one CCL14(9–74) that induces its adaptive up-regulation on the cell membrane. These results prompted us to reexamine recognition versus adaptive up-regulation and ligand degradation by D6 of different CC chemokines and their truncated isoforms. This analysis revealed that a proline residue in position 2 of the N-terminal domain of D6 ligands is dispensable for D6 binding but is required for high efficiency D6-mediated degradation and adaptive up-regulation. Recombinant human chemokines were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), with the exception of CCL3 and CCL14(9–74), which were purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). CCL14(11–74) was obtained by incubating CCL14(9–74) with recombinant CD26 (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA. Truncation was evaluated by desalting a small aliquot on a C4 ZipTip (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and subsequent mass spectrometry on an ion trap Esquire-LC mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). Once all CCL14(9–74) was converted into CCL14(11–74), the reaction was stopped by acidification with trifluoroacetic acid, and CCL14(11–74) was purified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry on a C8 Aquapore reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography column (2.1 × 220 mm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Edman degradation on a Procise cLC protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) confirmed the truncation of the N terminus and was used to determine the concentration of CCL14(11–74). CCL8 and CCL8(6–75) were chemically synthesized or expressed in Escherichia coli, as described previously (30Struyf S. Proost P. Vandercappellen J. Dempe S. Noyens B. Nelissen S. Gouwy M. Locati M.

CCL4 competitive binding was performed by incubating 3 × 104 CHO-K1/D6 transfectants, seeded in 96-well plates the day before the experiment, with 100 pm125I-labeled CCL4 in the presence of different concentrations of unlabeled CCL2, CCL4, CCL14, CCL17, or CCL22 in 60 μl of binding buffer (DMEM/F-12, 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1% BSA) at 4 °C for 2 h. After incubation, the cell-associated radioactivity was measured. To estimate the Kd (i.e. the equilibrium dissociation constant), CCL4 homologous competitive binding data were analyzed by non-linear regression using the equation of the homologous competitive binding curve (Prism4 software; GraphPad). Inhibition curves were analyzed using the one-site competitive binding equation to estimate the IC50 value, from which the Ki value was then calculated according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation. For ligand dissociation experiments, 3 × 104 CHO-K1/D6 cells seeded in 96-well plates were first incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 50 pm125I-labeled CCL4 in 60 μl of binding buffer (DMEM/F-12, 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1% BSA). After incubation with the tracer, the unbound radioligands were removed, and the cells were washed twice with cold binding buffer. Then a 100 nm concentration of either CCL2, CCL4, CCL14, CCL17, or CCL22 was added, and the dissociation of radioactive ligand was followed. The dissociation reactions were measured over a total period of 6 h. Antibody internalization experiments were performed to evaluate D6 internalization. CHO-K1/D6 transfectants (5 × 105) were washed with PBS (Biosera, East Sussex, UK) supplemented with 1% BSA (GE Healthcare Europe, Chalfont St. Giles, UK) and stained on ice with 5 μg/ml anti-D6 antibody for 1 h. Labeled cells were washed and then incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C in DMEM/F-12 with 1% BSA to allow receptor internalization. Where indicated, chemokines (116 nm) were added. Samples were then returned to ice, washed, and incubated with anti-rat IgG allophycocyanin for 30 min in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (PBS supplemented with 1% BSA and 0.01% NaN3). To evaluate receptor up-regulation on cell the surface, cells (5 × 105) were incubated at 37 °C with the indicated chemokine (100 nm) for different times in DMEM/F-12 with 1% BSA. Cells were then transferred on ice, washed, and labeled with FACS buffer containing 5 μg/ml anti-D6 phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody for 1 h. For all experiments, 1 × 104 events of viable cells were acquired using a FACS Canto flow cytometer and analyzed using the FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences). CHO-K1/D6 transfectants were plated the day before the experiment in 96-well plates at a concentration of 3 × 104 cells/well. Cells were then incubated with a 1.16 nm concentration of the indicated chemokine for increasing times. The supernatant was collected, and remaining intact chemokine was detected by sandwich ELISA or Western blot. To evaluate inhibition of chemokine scavenging, CHO-K1/D6 transfectants were plated as described above and then incubated for 6 h in 60 μl of DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 1% BSA, 0.1 nm125I-CCL4, and the indicated concentrations of unlabeled chemokines. Proteins in the supernatants were precipitated with 12.5% trichloroacetic acid (Carlo Erba Reagents, Rodano, Italy) at 4 °C for 15 min, and both soluble and insoluble fractions were collected. The radioactivity present in each fraction was measured using a Wizard automatic counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Inhibition of the degradation rate was obtained by data fitting with non-linear regression and interpolation with Michaelis-Menten equation using Prism4 software. Scavenging assay was performed on CHO-K1/D6 transfectants with 350 nm of the indicated chemokines. Supernatants were diluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer (10% glycerol, Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), electrophoresed under reducing conditions on 15% polyacrylamide gels, and electrotransferred onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad). Membranes were saturated with 5% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C and then probed with biotinylated goat anti-CCL14 or anti-CCL3 antibody (R&D Systems) for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (BioSPA, Milano, Italy). Peroxidase was detected by chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore). CHO-K1/D6 (1 × 105) cells were seeded onto glass dishes in 24-well plates and grown at 37 °C for 18 h. Cells were stimulated for 30 min with the indicated chemokines (100 nm) in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 1% BSA, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Merck) in PBS for 5 min, and incubated with 10% normal goat serum (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 30 min. Fixed cells were incubated with anti-D6 antibody (R&D Systems) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (pH 7.4), the coverslips were incubated with AlexaFluor594-conjugated anti-rat antibody for 1 h (Molecular Probes), extensively washed, and incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen) for 5 min. Specimens were mounted with FluoSave reagent (Calbiochem), and high resolution images (1024 × 1024 pixels) were acquired sequentially with a ×60 1.4 numerical aperture Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective by using an FV1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). Differential interference contrast (Nomarski technique) was also used. Images were assembled and cropped by Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Data were analyzed by unpaired Student's t test using Prism4 software. Linear regression analysis was performed, and the coefficient of correlation was calculated using Prism4 software. The chemokine decoy receptor D6 binds with high affinity most inflammatory CC chemokine agonists of CCR1 to CCR5. Three CC chemokines, namely CCL14, CCL15, and CCL23, constitute a distinct subfamily activated by proteolytic cleavage of the N terminus during inflammatory conditions. In order to understand if D6 was able to interact with this subfamily of chemokines, binding displacement experiments were performed on CHO-K1/hD6 transfectants using radiolabeled CCL4. Human D6 bound with high affinity the proteolytically activated CCL14(9–74) isoform and with lower affinity the full-length biologically inactive CCL14(1–74) isoform (Fig. 1A). The binding affinity of CCL14(9–74) was in the low nanomolar range, comparable with the one of CCL4 and CCL22, whereas the calculated Ki for CCL14(1–74) was similar to CCL17 (Table 1). Similar results were obtained for murine D6 (Table 1). CCL14(9–74) is subjected to proteolytic inactivation by the dipeptidyl peptidase CD26, which further cleaves the first two amino acids from the CCL14(9–74) N terminus, generating the biologically inactive CCL14(11–74) isoform. D6 also bound CCL14(11–74) (Fig. 1A), with a calculated Ki similar to CCL14(9–74) (Table 1). In order to define the ability of D6 to degrade CCL14 isoforms, scavenging assays were performed. CHO-K1/hD6 transfectants were incubated with 1.16 nm CCL14(1–74), CCL14(9–74), or CCL14(11–74) for increasing times, and the intact chemokine remaining in the supernatant was measured by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1B, the biologically active CCL14(9–74) was efficiently degraded by D6, whereas CCL14(1–74), although being recognized by D6, was fully recovered in the supernatant even after a 24-h incubation. Finally, the CD26-inactivated CCL14(11–74) isoform was degraded by D6 with significantly reduced efficiency as compared with CCL14(9–74) (T½ = 5.7 ± 0.4 versus 2.3 ± 0.2 h, respectively; p = 0.0016). Because ELISA tests can detect partially degraded chemokines, supernatants derived from CHO-K1 or CHO-K1/hD6 incubated with CCL14(1–74) or CCL14(9–74) for 24 h were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The band corresponding to CCL14(9–74) was not detectable after incubation with CHO-K1/hD6 transfectants, indicating complete degradation of the protein, whereas the band corresponding to CCL14(1–74) was not affected by incubation with either CHO-K1 or CHO-K1/hD6 transfectants, consistent with a lack of degradation by D6 (Fig. 1C). These data identify CCL14 and its processing isoforms as new D6 ligands and indicate that CCL14 processing not only affects its biological properties but also influences its binding affinity for D6. Furthermore, since cleavage of the first 2 amino acids from CCL14(9–74) does not influence D6 binding but significantly impairs D6-mediated degradation, these results also indicate that a direct correlation between ligand affinity and degradation by D6 is not present for CCL14 and its truncated isoforms.TABLE 1Binding constants of different chemokines and their processed isoforms for human and murine D6LigandKi ± S.E.Human D6Murine D6nmCCL22.2 ± 0.11aData obtained using 125I-labeled human CCL2.NDbND, not detected.CCL317.25 ± 1.48NDCCL3(5–68)4.68 ± 0.97NDCCL3L11.21 ± 1.48NDCCL41.46 ± 1.110.16 ± 0.004CCL810 ± 0.17aData obtained using 125I-labeled human CCL2.NDCCL8(6–75)20 ± 0.3aData obtained using 125I-labeled human CCL2.NDCCL14(1–74)23.40 ± 3.346.4 ± 2.83CCL14(9–74)1.53 ± 0.250.75 ± 0.39CCL14(11–74)6.5 ± 1.2NDCCL1717.25 ± 5.02NDCCL220.48 ± 0.21NDa Data obtained using 125I-labeled human CCL2.b ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab Like CCL14, CCL15 and CCL23 are also produced as prochemokines that undergo proteolytic cleavage of the N terminus during inflammatory conditions to be activated. Differently from CCL14, no binding was detected on CHO-K1/hD6 transfectants for CCL15 and CCL23, both for full-length and truncated isoforms (Fig. 2A). Similarly, CHO-K1/mD6 transfectants were unable to bind both full-length and truncated isoforms of CCL6 and CCL9, the murine CCL15 and CCL23 orthologues (23Forssmann U. Mägert H.J. Adermann K. Escher S.E. Forssmann W.G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 357-366PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Since CCL14(1–74) is recognized by D6 but not degraded, we asked whether this chemokine isoform might work as a D6 antagonist. To this purpose, we first evaluate whether CCL14(1–74) could modify the constitutive internalization of D6 by performing antibody internalization experiments. CHO-K1/hD6 transfectants were incubated at 4 °C in the presence of a monoclonal antibody to D6 in order to label only receptors on the cell surface and were then returned at 37 °C for increasing times in the presence of CCL14(1–74) or CCL14(9–74). As shown by Fig. 3A, the D6 constitutive internalization rate was not modified by the addition of different CCL14 isoforms, suggesting that these chemokine isoforms, like the other D6 ligands, could not influence the receptor internalization rate. Since inflammatory CC chemokines are able to adaptively up-regulate D6 surface expression levels (14Bonecchi R. Borroni E.M. Anselmo A. Doni A. Savino B. Mirolo M. Fabbri M. Jala V.R. Haribabu B. Mantovani A. Locati M. Blood. 2008; 112: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we investigated whether different CCL14 isoforms could exert a similar effect. As shown in Fig. 3B, although CCL14(9–74) was able to induce a dose-dependent increase of D6 expression to a similar extent as other D6 high affinity ligands, including CCL3L1, CCL4, and CCL17, CCL14(1–74) did not modify D6 surface levels. These data were confirmed by immunofluorescence experiments on CHO-K1/hD6 transfectants (Fig. 3E). CCL14(9–74) like CCL22 was able to induce D6 membrane translocation, whereas CCL14(1–74) did not affect D6 intracellular localization. In order to understand whether CCL14(1–74) might inhibit D6 scavenging activity due to receptor occupancy, CHO-K1/hD6 transfectants were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-CCL4 together with increasing concentrations of unlabeled chemokines. CCL4 degradation was not modified by CCL14(1–74) addition, whereas co-incubation with CCL14(9–74), CCL17, or CCL22 inhibited CCL4 degradation rate (Fig. 3C). To further investigate the potential inhibitory activity of CCL14(1–74) on D6 scavenging, dissociation curves were performed using radiolabeled CCL4 at the equilibrium (3 h) on CHO-K1/hD6 transfectants and subsequently incubating cells for increasing times with unlabeled chemokines. 125I-CCL4 was fully displaced from the receptor by the homologous unlabeled chemokine (Fig. 3D). Heterologous dissociation reactions indicate that 125I-CCL4 could also be fully displaced from the receptor by unlabeled CCL17, CCL22, and CCL14(9–74), with dissociation curves similar to those observed with homologous dissociation. On the contrary, CCL14(1–74) was unable to fully displace 125I-CCL4, suggesting that it has only partially overlapping binding sites on D6. Results reported above indicate that the biological outcome of D6 binding to CCL14 and its processing isoforms is strongly influenced by the N-terminal domain of the ligand. Other chemokine isoforms with a modified N-terminal domain were tested in binding and scavenging assays on CHO-K1/hD6 transfectants to understand whether this also applies to other D6 ligands. CCL3 is a non-allelic isoform of CCL3L1 with reduced agonistic activity on CCR5 and decreased binding affinity for both CCR5 and D6 due to only a few amino acid substitutions, including the presence of a serine instead of a proline residue at position 2 (31Nibbs R.J. Yang J. Landau N.R. Mao J.H. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17478-17483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). CCL3 displaced 125I-CCL4 with a calculated Ki similar to CCL14(1–74) (Fig. 4A), it was degraded by D6-expressing cells with a significantly reduced efficiency as compared with CCL3L1 (T½ = 6.3 ± 0.3 versus 0.5 ± 0.1 h, respectively; p = 0.0006) (Fig. 4, B and C), it did not induce D6 membrane up-regulation (Fig. 4, E and F), and it only partially displaced previously bound CCL4 (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that the N-terminal proline residue in position 2 of CCL3L1 is required to modify receptor trafficking that leads to rapid chemokine degradation. When the processed isoform of CCL3, CCL3(5–68) (20Proost P. Menten P. Struyf S. Schutyser E. De Meester I. Van Damme J. Blood. 2000; 96: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was tested, it was found to bind D6 with higher binding affinity, as compared with CCL3 (Fig. 4A and Table 1), but was not degraded by D6-expressing cells (Fig. 4, B and C), did not modify D6 surface expression levels (Fig. 4, E and F), and only partially displaced previously bound CCL4 (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that the N-terminal portion of CCL3 is not required for D6 binding. On the contrary, deletion of the first 4 amino acids of CCL3 increased its binding affinity to D6 but completely abolished its degradation. Finally, when CCL8 and its truncated isoform CCL8(6–75) (30Struyf S. Proost P. Vandercappellen J. Dempe S. Noyens B. Nelissen S. Gouwy M. Locati M. Opdenakker G. Dinsart C. Van Damme J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2009; 39: 843-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were tested in D6 binding and scavenging experiments, N-terminal truncation of CCL8 did not significantly affect D6 binding (Table 1), but CCL8 (6–75) was degraded with a significantly reduced efficiency as compared with full-length CCL8 (T½ = 6.4 ± 0.4 versus 2.5 ± 0.1 h, respectively; p = 0.003), similar to CCL3 and CCL14(11–74) (data not shown). Results reported above indicate that D6 ligands can be classified into three classes according to degradation efficiency: 1) chemokines degraded with high efficiency (including CCL14(9–74) as well as CCL2, CCL3L1, CCL4, and CCL22); 2) chemokines degraded with low efficiency (including CCL14(11–74) and CCL8(6–75) as well as CCL3); and 3) chemokines that are not degraded (including CCL14(1–74) and CCL3(5–68)). For the chemokines evaluated in this study, no direct correlation was found between binding affinities and degradation efficiency (Fig. 5A), indicating that chemokine recognition by D6 does not necessarily result in its efficient degradation. On the other hand, only chemokines that are degraded with high efficiency are also able to modify intracellular D6 traffic, as shown by the positive correlation between chemokine degradation efficiency and D6 adaptive up-regulation on the cell membrane (Fig. 5B). Finally, a strong correlation was found between chemokine degradation efficiency and displacement of CCL4 previously bound to D6 (Fig. 5C), indicating that only chemokines with D6 overlapping binding sites with CCL4 are able to induce their rapid degradation. Interestingly, sequence analysis (Fig. 6) revealed that all members of this class of D6 ligands, with the only exception of CCL17, have a proline residue in position 2, suggesting a relevant role for this amino acid in the induction of D6 adaptive redistribution on the cell membrane that results in efficient chemokine degradation.FIGURE 6Amino acid sequence of employed CC chemokines.

Bonecchi R. Locati M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 8Mortier A. Van Damme J. Proost P. Pharmacol. Ther. 2008; 120: 197-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). CCL14, CCL15, and CCL23 represent a unique subfamily of chemokines, in that they are classified as constitutive because they circulate at substantial levels in the serum of healthy subjects but act as inflammatory chemokines after cleavage of their unique N-terminal domain (23Forssmann U. Mägert H.J. Adermann K. Escher S.E. Forssmann W.G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 357-366PubMed Google Scholar). This study identifies one of these chemokines, namely CCL14, and its truncated isoforms as new ligands for the chemokine decoy receptor D6. Unexpectedly, although it was recognized with similar affinity, the scavenging activity of D6 for the three CCL14 isoforms is completely different. The full-length biologically inactive CCL14(1–74) is not degraded by D6, whereas D6 degrades the inflammatory chemokine CCL14(9–74) with high efficacy, and its efficacy is significantly reduced for the CD26-inactivated CCL14(11–74) isoform. Thus, the N-terminal portion of CCL14, which controls the biological activity of this chemokine, also plays a key role in its degradation. Removal of the first 8 amino acids is required for CCL14 conversion into a potent inflammatory chemokine but also allows D6-mediated degradation, and further proteolytic cleavage strongly impairs its biological activity and similarly reduces the rate of degradation via D6. D6 may thus be added to the regulatory mechanisms of CCL14 activity. CCL14 is present in the blood as an inactive chemokine. It is proteolytically activated by serine proteases of the fibrinolytic cascade to a potent chemoattractant for CCR1/CCR3/CCR5-expressing cells (26Vakili J. Ständker L. Detheux M. Vassart G. Forssmann W.G. Parmentier M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3406-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and is then either further processed by CD26 or degraded by the scavenging receptor D6 (Fig. 7). Processing of CCL14(9–74) to CCL14(11–74) strongly affects the efficiency of D6-mediated degradation. This conversion is mediated by CD26, a dipeptidyl peptidase that cleaves specifically after a proline residue present in position 2 of CCL14(9–74). In order to test the relevance of this residue for D6-mediated degradation, we compared CCL3L1 with its non-allelic isoform CCL3, which only differs by a proline-to-serine substitution in position 2 (31Nibbs R.J. Yang J. Landau N.R. Mao J.H. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17478-17483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and its truncated isoform CCL3(5–68). As compared with CCL3L1, both CCL3 and CCL3(5–68) showed a significant reduction of D6-mediated degradation. Similarly, the CCL8 truncated isoform CCL8(6–75) retained binding to D6, but it was degraded at a significantly slower rate as compared with CCL8. Collectively, these data indicate that there is no correlation between chemokine binding affinities and their effective degradation by D6 and that a proline residue in position 2 of the N-terminal domain of D6 ligands is required for rapid degradation. Results presented here describe CCL14(1–74) as the first D6 ligand that is not degraded. CCL14(1–74) also did not affect D6 constitutive internalization or membrane up-regulation; nor did it modify inflammatory degradation of other ligands. For these characteristics, CCL14(1–74) may be considered the first D6 neutral ligand (32Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Heterologous dissociation curves indicated that unlabeled CCL14(1–74) only partially displaced previously bound 125I-CCL4 (Fig. 3), suggesting that it interacted with D6 regions that are not available when the receptor is occupied with other ligands or that it had partly overlapping D6 binding sites. The same behavior in dissociation experiments was found for CCL3 and CCL3(5–76). Interestingly, a similar phenomenon was observed for other chemokine receptors, such as CCR1 (33Jensen P.C. Thiele S. Ulven T. Schwartz T.W. Rosenkilde M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23121-23128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), CXCR2 (34Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20545-20550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and the virus-encoded ORF74 and US28 chemokine receptors (32Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Chemokine interaction with their cognate receptors is believed to occur through a first interaction of the rigid loop of the chemokine that follows the second cysteine, which is important for high affinity binding, followed by the interaction of the flexible N terminus of the chemokine preceding the first cysteine, which is essential for the subsequent receptor activation (35Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Bondue A. Govaerts C. De Leener A. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Proudfoot A. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5179-5187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We are here proposing that a similar mechanism may also occur for the chemokine decoy receptor D6, in which chemokines may first bind D6 with their N-loop and then activate their pathway to degradation through the binding of their N-terminal proline to the D6 seven-transmembrane bundle. In the absence of this second step, as in the case of ligands without a proline in position 2, receptor trafficking is not modified, and the D6-dependent degradative activity is strongly reduced. In conclusion, results presented here indicate that D6 cooperates with CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV (29Forssmann U. Hartung I. Bälder R. Fuchs B. Escher S.E. Spodsberg N. Dulkys Y. Walden M. Heitland A. Braun A. Forssmann W.G. Elsner J. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3456-3466Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in the inactivation and degradation of biologically active CCL14 isoforms. Moreover, by using CCL14 and other chemokine isoforms, we have shown that a proline residue in position 2 of D6 ligands is dispensable for receptor binding, but it is required to induce receptor traffic modifications resulting in efficient degradation of inflammatory CC chemokines."
https://openalex.org/W2053953105,"It has recently become apparent that the familiar rods and cones are not the only photoreceptors in mammals — a third class known as intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are now known to relay light information that synchronizes circadian rhythms and triggers the papillary light reflex. Here, Cheng et al. show that a subset of retinal horizontal cells in teleost fish is also photosensitive. Like mammalian ipRGCs, the photopigment that confers photosensitivity in this subset of vertebrate horizontal cells appears to be melanopsin. It has recently become apparent that rods and cones are not the only photoreceptors in mammals. A third class, known as intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, use the photopigment melanopsin and mediate non-image-forming visual functions such as circadian photoentrainment. In teleost fish, a subset of horizontal cells is now shown to be photosensitive; the photopigment responsible for this seems to be melanopsin. The discovery of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells has overthrown the long-held belief that rods and cones are the exclusive retinal photoreceptors1,2. Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells use melanopsin3 as the photopigment, and mediate non-image-forming visual functions such as circadian photoentrainment. In fish, in situ hybridization studies indicated that melanopsin is present in retinal horizontal cells4,5,6—lateral association neurons critical for creating the centre-surround receptive fields of visual neurons. This raises the question of whether fish horizontal cells are intrinsically photosensitive. This notion was examined previously in flat-mount roach retina, but all horizontal-cell light response disappeared after synaptic transmission was blocked6, making any conclusion difficult to reach. To examine this question directly, we have now recorded from single, acutely dissociated horizontal cells from catfish and goldfish. We found that light induced a response in catfish cone horizontal cells, but not rod horizontal cells, consisting of a modulation of the nifedipine-sensitive, voltage-gated calcium current. The light response was extremely slow, lasting for many minutes. Similar light responses were observed in a high percentage of goldfish horizontal cells. We have cloned two melanopsin genes and one vertebrate ancient (VA) opsin gene from catfish. In situ hybridization indicated that melanopsin, but less likely VA opsin, was expressed in the horizontal-cell layer of catfish retina. This intrinsic light response may serve to modulate, over a long timescale, lateral inhibition mediated by these cells. Thus, at least in some vertebrates, there are retinal non-rod/non-cone photoreceptors involved primarily in image-forming vision."

Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3085-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In addition, BLM and its yeast homolog Sgs1 may play a role at the initial steps of DNA double-strand break repair by participating in exonucleolitic resection of the DNA ends to generate DNA molecules with the 3′-ssDNA tails, a substrate for RAD51 binding (26Mimitou E.P.

Chem. 2003; 278: 42729-42732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Whereas some proteins promote HR (14Sung P. Klein H. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Disruption of the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament appears to be an especially important mechanism of controlling HR. This filament disruption activity was demonstrated for the yeast Srs2 helicase (34Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P.

Jasin M. Vogel H. Sung P. Luo G. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3073-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that BLM can also catalyze disruption of the RAD51-ssDNA filament (25Bugreev D.V. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Mazin A.V. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3085-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This disruption only occurs if the filament is present in an inactive ADP-bound form, e.g. in the presence of Mg2+. Conversion of RAD51 into an active ATP-bound form, e.g. in the presence of Ca2+ (37Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), renders the filament resistant to BLM disruption (25Bugreev D.V. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Mazin A.V. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3085-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyze the interactions of BLM with an active ATP-bound RAD51-ssDNA filament. Surprisingly, we found that BLM stimulates the DNA strand exchange activity of RAD51. Thus, depending on the conformational state of the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, BLM may either inhibit or stimulate the DNA strand exchange activity of RAD51. Our analysis demonstrated that, in contrast to several known stimulatory proteins that act by promoting formation of the RAD51-ssDNA filament, BLM stimulates the DNA strand exchange activity of RAD51 at a later stage, during synapsis. Stimulation appears to be independent of the ATPase activity of BLM. We suggest that this stimulation of RAD51 may represent a novel function of BLM in homologous recombination. Human RAD51, DMC1, RAD54, RPA, BLM, BLM K695R, murine Hop2/Mnd1, and yeast Rad51 and Rad54 proteins were purified as described (38Petukhova G.V. Pezza R.J. Vanevski F. Ploquin M. Masson J.Y. Camerini-Otero R.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The BLM K695A ATPase mutant was kindly provided by P. Sung. Supercoiled pUC19 dsDNA was purified as described (37Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). All of the oligonucleotides (IDT, Inc.) used in this study (supplemental Table S1) were purified, labeled, and stored as described previously (39Bugreev D.V. Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. Nat. Prot. 2006; (DOI:2010.1038/nprot.2006.2217)Google Scholar). dsDNA substrates were prepared by annealing of oligonucleotides, as described in Ref. 39Bugreev D.V. Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. Nat. Prot. 2006; (DOI:2010.1038/nprot.2006.2217)Google Scholar. To form the nucleoprotein filament, 32P-labeled ssDNA (ssDNA 90; 3 μm nucleotides) was incubated with human or yeast Rad51 protein (1 μm) in standard buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 20 mm phosphocreatine, and 30 units/ml creatine phosphokinase for 15 min (unless indicated otherwise) at 37 °C. When indicated, RPA (0.13 μm) was added to the reaction. BLM (in the indicated concentrations) was added prior to the addition of pUC19 scDNA (50 μm nucleotides), unless indicated otherwise. D-loop formation was terminated after a 15-min incubation. The products were deproteinized, analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA), visualized, and quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). The yield of D-loops was expressed as a percentage of the total plasmid DNA. This assay measures homology-independent conjunction of RAD51-ssDNA presynaptic filament with dsDNA in complexes that sediment at more than 10,000 S (Svedberg) (2 min at 15,000 × g) (40Tsang S.S. Chow S.A. Radding C.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3226-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To form the nucleoprotein filament, RAD51 (1 μm) was incubated with ssDNA (ssDNA 71; 3 μm nucleotides) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 20 mm phosphocreatine, and 30 units/ml creatine phosphokinase for 15 min at 37 °C. Then NaCl was added in the indicated concentration followed by the addition of BLM (100 nm), HOP2/MND1 (100 nm), or RAD54 protein (100 nm). After 10 min of incubation, dsDNA capture was initiated by the addition of 32P-labeled pUC19 (25 μm nucleotides), linearized with BamHI restriction endonuclease, followed by 10 min of incubation at 37 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn from the reaction mixture, and co-aggregates were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 21 °C. The yield of co-aggregates was determined using a Beckman LS 6500 radioactive counter. The residual retention of the radioactive DNA on the tube walls, ∼1–2%, was subtracted from the measurements. BLM (in the indicated concentrations) was incubated with ssDNA (ssDNA 71; 32 nm molecules) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 1 mm ATP (or indicated nucleotide co-factor), 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 20 mm phosphocreatine, and 30 units/ml creatine phosphokinase for 10 min at 37 °C. To start the reaction 32P-labeled dsDNA (ssDNA 5/6; 32 nm molecules) was added followed by 15 min of incubation. The reactions were terminated and deproteinized by the addition of stop buffer up to 1.5% SDS and proteinase K (800 μg/ml) for 5 min at 25 °C, mixed with a 0.1 volume of loading buffer (70% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), and analyzed by electrophoresis in 10% native polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 1 mm EDTA) at 135 V for 1.5 h. RAD51 shows characteristics of a self-inactivating ATPase; during ATP hydrolysis in the presence of Mg2+, the RAD51-ssDNA filament turns into an inactive ADP-bound form (37Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that BLM can disrupt an inactive ADP-bound RAD51-ssDNA filament by dislodging RAD51 from ssDNA (25Bugreev D.V. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Mazin A.V. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3085-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Here we wanted to investigate interactions of BLM with a RAD51-ssDNA filament maintained in an active ATP-bound form in the presence of Ca2+. Using the D-loop assay (Fig. 1A), we found that the addition of BLM to an active RAD51 filament stimulates joint molecule formation 2–4-fold (Fig. 1, B and C). Control experiments showed that BLM alone has some limited ability to promote D-loop formation; however, this activity was too small to account for the observed stimulation of RAD51 DNA pairing (Fig. 1, B, lanes 17–21, and C). With the D-loop assay, we also showed that BLM can stimulate the DNA strand exchange activity of DMC1 protein, a meiosis-specific RAD51 homolog (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2BLM stimulates the DNA strand exchange activity of DMC1. A, the experimental scheme. The asterisk indicates the 32P label. B, nucleoprotein filaments were formed by incubation of DMC1 (1 μm) with 32P-labeled ssDNA (ssDNA 90; 3 μm nucleotides) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 30 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 32P-labeled ssDNA (ssDNA 90; 3 μm nucleotides), and the indicated amount of CaCl2 for 15 min at 37 °C. To initiate the reactions, BLM (100 nm) was added followed by the addition of pUC19 scDNA (50 μm nucleotides). Products of DNA strand exchange were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in 1× TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA). C, the results from B represented as a graph.

We did not observe RecA stimulation by BLM also in the presence of Ca2+ and ATP under tested conditions (data not shown). We also tested whether RECQ1 (RECQL1), another member of the human RecQ family, has a stimulatory effect on RAD51. The biochemical properties of RECQ1 and BLM are similar; both proteins physically interact with RAD51 (41Cui S. Klima R. Ochem A. Arosio D. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. J. Biol.

However, RECQ1 did not stimulate DNA strand exchange promoted by RAD51 under tested conditions; in contrast, at high concentrations RECQ1 inhibited this reaction (Fig. 1D). In the accompanying paper, Kikuchi et al. (59Kikuchi K. Abdel-Aziz H.I. Taniguchi Y. Yamazoe M. Takeda S. Hirota K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26360-26367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) demonstrate that BLM is required for recombination between homeologous DNA sequences (homologous sequences with some mismatches) in the DT-40 cells. Here, we examined the effect of BLM on DNA strand exchange between homeologous ssDNA and pUC19 scDNA promoted by RAD51 (Fig. 4). As expected, mismatches in DNA substrates significantly reduce the efficiency of the RAD51-promoted DNA strand exchange (Fig. 4, A and B). The addition of BLM increases the extent of D-loop formation on DNA substrates containing 10% of mismatches ∼4-fold (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, BLM stimulates the RAD51 DNA strand exchange activity on both homologous and homeologous DNA substrates. Our current results showed that BLM stimulates DNA strand exchange activity of RAD51 and DMC1. The BLM stimulation appeared to be specific for these two human recombinases. Several known Rad51 stimulatory proteins act by promoting Rad51 filament formation on ssDNA or by facilitating the interaction of the filament with dsDNA (45San Filippo J. Sung P. Klein H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). To characterize the mechanism of a BLM-dependent RAD51 stimulation, we tested the effect that order of addition of BLM and RAD51 has on this stimulation (Fig. 5A). We found no stimulation of D-loop formation when BLM was incubated with ssDNA before the addition of RAD51 and pUC19 scDNA (Fig. 5, B and C, scheme I). In contrast, stimulation was observed when BLM was added after formation of the RAD51 filament; it reached maximum, ∼3-fold, when BLM was added either after pUC19 DNA or at the same time as pUC19 (Fig. 5, B and C, schemes IV and V). The stimulation was smaller, ∼1.5-fold, when BLM was added to the RAD51-ssDNA prior to pUC19 scDNA (Fig. 5, B and C, scheme III). Thus, these results indicate that BLM exerts its stimulatory effect likely after completion of filament formation, during the search for homology and DNA strand exchange. The Rad51 mediator proteins that promote loading of Rad51 on ssDNA are known to alleviate an inhibition of Rad51-ssDNA filament formation by RPA, a single-stranded binding protein, when RPA was bound to ssDNA prior to Rad51 (30Sung P. Krejci L. Van Komen S. Sehorn M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42729-42732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that BLM does not rescue DNA strand exchange that was inhibited by RPA, when RPA was bound to ssDNA before the addition of RAD51 (Fig. 5, B and C, scheme VI). On the other hand, RPA did not diminish the stimulatory effect of BLM when added to an assembled nucleoprotein filament (Fig. 5, B and C, scheme VII), indicating no specific interactions between BLM and RPA, which could prevent RAD51 stimulation by BLM at the presynaptic stage. Also, consistent with the inability of BLM to promote RAD51 loading on ssDNA, we found that BLM did not rescue DNA strand exchange when RAD51 was added to the mixture of ssDNA and scDNA, instead of being first preincubated with ssDNA to form the filament (Fig. 5, B and C, scheme II). Thus, we concluded that, unlike several known RAD51 mediators that act during RAD51-ssDNA filament formation, BLM stimulates RAD51 at the synaptic or postsynaptic stage. It is known that RAD54, an important HR protein of the Swi2/Snf2 family, also stimulates RAD51-promoted DNA strand exchange at the synaptic or postsynaptic stage. Because RAD54 stimulates RAD51 in an ATPase-dependent manner, we expected that the ATPase activity of BLM, which is required for its translocation on DNA, would also be important for stimulation of the RAD51 DNA strand exchange activity. However, using the D-loop assay, we found that the ATPase-deficient BLM K695A mutant stimulates DNA strand exchange activity of RAD51 similar to wild type BLM (compare Fig. 1C with Fig. 6, B, lanes 8–14, and C). Furthermore, we then found that BLM can stimulate RAD51 in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP (Fig. 6D). Therefore, the ATPase activity of BLM is not required for stimulation of the DNA strand exchange activity of RAD51. Thus, BLM stimulates the RAD51 strand exchange activity through a novel mechanism that is independent of BLM translocation along DNA. We wanted to explore further the role of an active form of the RAD51 filament in BLM-dependent stimulation of DNA strand exchange. We investigated whether the active form of the filament is merely needed for prevention of the RAD51 filament disruption or whether it plays a significant role in productive interactions of the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament with BLM required for stimulation of DNA strand exchange. Using wild type BLM we found that the stimulation occurs only in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 7, A–C). However, this result did not exclude the possibility that in the absence of Ca2+ BLM efficiently disrupts an inactive RAD51 filament or D-loops containing inactive RAD51 (25Bugreev D.V. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Mazin A.V. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3085-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), thereby diminishing the effect of stimulation. Indeed, Ca2+ depletion with EGTA during outgoing D-loop formation by Rad51 results in significant dissociation of D-loops by BLM (Fig. 7, D and E). Therefore, we used BLM K695A mutant that cannot disrupt RAD51 filaments (25Bugreev D.V. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Mazin A.V. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3085-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) but stimulates RAD51 strand exchange activity as efficiently as wild type BLM (Fig. 6). We found that BLM K695A failed to stimulate an inactive RAD51 filament assembled in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 8). We then tested the effect of BLM on the RAD51 K133R and K133A ATPase-deficient mutants. Of these two mutants, the RAD51 K133R is known to form an active filament on ssDNA in the presence of ATP, whereas the RAD51 K133A can only form an inactive filament because of poor ATP binding. We found that BLM K695A stimulates DNA pairing activity of the RAD51 K133R but not that of RAD51 K133A mutant (Fig. 8).FIGURE 8An active ATP-bound state of RAD51 filament is required for BLM stimulation. A, the experimental scheme. The asterisk indicates the 32P label. B, RAD51-ssDNA filaments formed either in the standard buffer containing 0.5 mm CaCl2 (Ca, to produce an active ATP-bound filament) or 0.5 mm MgCl2 (Mg, to produce an inactive ADP-bound filament). In the right panel, the ATPase-deficient mutants RAD51 K133A and K133R were used instead of RAD51 wild type (WT) to form nucleoprotein filaments in standard buffer containing 0.5 mm MgCl2. D-loop formation was initiated by the addition of BLM K695A (100 nm) and pUC19 scDNA (50 μm nucleotides).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Therefore, the conformation of the RAD51-ssDNA filament plays an important role in determining the outcome of interactions with BLM. We found that BLM can only stimulate DNA pairing activity of an active ATP-bound form of the RAD51-ssDNA filament. It was recently shown that Hop2/Mnd1 heterodimer stimulates RAD51 and DMC1 proteins by enhancing dsDNA binding by the RAD51-ssDNA and DMC1-ssDNA filaments (31Chi P. San Filippo J. Sehorn M.G. Petukhova G.V. Sung P. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1747-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 46Pezza R.J. Voloshin O.N. Vanevski F. Camerini-Otero R.D. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1758-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that RAD54 has a similar effect on dsDNA binding by the RAD51 filament (47Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we wanted to test whether BLM may stimulate the DNA pairing activity of RAD51 by the same mechanism. As in our previous studies with RAD54 (47Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we used a co-aggregation assay that measures formation of low speed sedimenting co-aggregates resulting from the homology-independent uptake of dsDNA by the RAD51-ssDNA filament (48Chow S.A. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 5646-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). If BLM were to increase dsDNA binding affinity of the RAD51-ssDNA filament, we would expect to observe an increase in resistance of co-aggregates to solution ion strength. Using 32P-labeled linearized pUC19 dsDNA as a substrate, we found that Hop2/Mnd1 and, to a smaller degree, RAD54 increases the salt resistance of co-aggregates between RAD51 and dsDNA, as expected (Fig. 9). In contrast, BLM did not significantly increase the resistance of the co-aggregates to the solution ion strength. Thus, the mechanism of stimulation of the RAD51 DNA pairing activity does apparently not include an increase in the dsDNA binding affinity of the RAD51-ssDNA filament. Previously, it was shown that herpes simplex virus UL9 DNA helicase can promote unwinding of the DNA duplex in an ATPase-independent manner (49He X. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3024-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We suggested that BLM binding may also cause a local destabilization of the DNA helix and thereby facilitate the search for homology and DNA strand exchange promoted by RAD51. We expected that if dsDNA were unwound by BLM, it would anneal with complementary ssDNA to form a tailed DNA product (Fig. 10A). Indeed, we observed formation of the tailed DNA during incubation of BLM with dsDNA in the presence of homologous ssDNA (Fig. 10, B, lanes 2–8, and C). In contrast, RAD54 protein and RECQ1 helicase did not efficiently promote formation of the tailed DNA product (Fig. 10, B, lanes 9–14, and C). The observed product could result from resection of the dsDNA by contaminating exonucleases followed by annealing to the homologous ssDNA. However, analysis of the BLM-treated 32P-labeled dsDNA performed by electrophoresis in a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea confirmed full integrity of the dsDNA, ruling out this possibility (data not shown). DNA strand exchange activity of BLM showed no dependence on ATP; omission of ATP or its substitution with either ADP or a nonhydrolyzable analog AMP-PNP did not significantly affect the reaction (Fig. 10D). Thus, the ATP independence of BLM-promoted DNA strand exchange parallels the ATP independence of RAD51 stimulation by BLM (Fig. 8). We also tested the ability of BLM to promote D-loop formation (Fig. 10E). In the presence of ATP, BLM did not efficiently promote formation of D-loops (Fig. 10E, lane 1). However, it was previously demonstrated that in the presence of ATP BLM can disassemble D-loops through its helicase or branch migration activities (19Bachrati C.Z. Borts R.H. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2269-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 25Bugreev D.V. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Mazin A.V. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3085-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 7). Indeed, D-loop formation noticeably increased when we inhibited these BLM activities by omitting ATP or substituting it with the nonhydrolyzable analog AMP-PNP or when we replaced BLM with the BLM K695A ATPase-deficient mutant that lacks D-loop dissociation activity (Fig. 10E). Note that this D-loop formation activity of BLM alone was still not large enough to account for the additive increase in the reaction with RAD51 (Figs. 1C and 6C). We also tested the possibility that BLM may stimulate RAD51 DNA strand exchange because of its known ssDNA annealing activity (50Cheok C.F. Wu L. Garcia P.L. Janscak P. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3932-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, we found that one of the BLM mutants, K695R, was efficient in ssDNA annealing but showed a very low ability to promote DNA strand exchange (Fig. 11, A–D). We tested this mutant for the ability to stimulate RAD51 DNA strand exchange and found that it was significantly less efficient than BLM wild type and the BLM K695A mutant (Fig. 11E). Thus, stimulation of RAD51 by BLM correlates with the ability of BLM to promote apparent exchange of DNA strands between homologous ss- and dsDNA substrates (dsDNA melting followed by annealing with ssDNA) not with the BLM annealing activity. We suggest that, similar to UL9 DNA helicase, BLM may destabilize dsDNA and thereby facilitate the search for homology and DNA strand exchange promoted by RAD51. Mutations in the BLM helicase cause BS, which is associated with profound genomic instability. Because the frequency of certain recombination events, especially sister chromatid exchanges, is elevated in BS cells, it was suggested that the function of BLM is to down-regulate HR. Several biochemical activities of BLM have been identified in previous studies that are consistent with this view; BLM may dissolve double Holliday junctions (22Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar), dissociate joint molecules (19Bachrati C.Z. Borts R.H. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2269-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 20van Brabant A.J. Ye T. Sanz M. German 3rd, J.L. Ellis N.A. Holloman W.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14617-14625Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and disrupt the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament (25Bugreev D.V. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Mazin A.V. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3085-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, genetic studies indicate that BLM may also play a role in promoting HR (51McVey M. Larocque J.R. Adams M.D. Sekelsky J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15694-15699Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 52Adams M.D. McVey M. Sekelsky J.J. Science. 2003; 299: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In this study, we present data indicating a new possible function of BLM in HR: the stimulation of the DNA strand exchange activity of RAD51. BLM shows specificity in stimulation of DNA strand exchange promoted by human RAD51 and DMC1. We show that BLM does not stimulate RAD51 orthologs, either E. coli RecA or S. cerevisiae Rad51. Stimulation of RAD51 is not a common property of human RecQ helicases; RECQ1 does not stimulate RAD51 activity under our tested conditions, despite the fact that RECQ1 physically interacts with RAD51 (43Sharma S. Brosh Jr., R.M. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The interaction between RAD51 and BLM may also be important in recruiting BLM to the sites of recombinational repair for serving downstream functions, e.g. stimulation of DNA repair synthesis after strand invasion and dissociation of D-loops after their extension by DNA polymerase and RAD51 inactivation (25Bugreev D.V. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Mazin A.V. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3085-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 51McVey M. Larocque J.R. Adams M.D. Sekelsky J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15694-15699Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 52Adams M.D. McVey M. Sekelsky J.J. Science. 2003; 299: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that BLM can also stimulate the DNA pairing activity of DMC1, a meiosis-specific homolog of RAD51 (Fig. 2). It is known that BLM plays an important role in meiosis. The expression of BLM is greatly elevated in meiotic prophase, and the protein co-localizes with RAD51/DMC1 foci (53Moens P.B. Freire R. Tarsounas M. Spyropoulos B. Jackson S.P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 663-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, males homozygous for BLM mutations are infertile, and heterozygous individuals display increased frequencies of chromosome abnormalities in their spermatozoa (1German J. Medicine. 1993; 72: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In Drosophila melanogaster, mutations in the BLM gene reduce the frequency of meiotic recombination and alter cross-over distribution (54McVey M. Andersen S.L. Broze Y. Sekelsky J. Genetics. 2007; 176: 1979-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the DNA strand exchange activity of DMC1 may be related to a meiotic function of BLM. We showed that BLM stimulates the RAD51 DNA strand exchange on homeologous DNA substrates containing 10% of heterology. This result is consistent with the accompanying report by Kikuchi et al. (59Kikuchi K. Abdel-Aziz H.I. Taniguchi Y. Yamazoe M. Takeda S. Hirota K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26360-26367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) demonstrating that BLM is required for Ig gene conversion, in which recombination occurs between homeologous DNA sequences containing approximately the same degree of heterology. The apparent BLM independence of recombination between fully homologous substrates observed in this work may indicate that the efficiency of DNA strand exchange promoted by RAD51 on such substrates ceases to be the limited step during HR. Thus, RAD51 stimulation by BLM may be especially important on “difficult” DNA substrates containing mismatches. BLM shows significant similarity in its biochemical properties with RAD54. Like RAD54, BLM can translocate on DNA in an ATPase-dependent manner, bind specifically to Holliday junctions, and promote their migration, physically interact with RAD51, and disrupt joint molecules formed by RAD51 protein (2Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 16Wu L. Davies S.L. Levitt N.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19375-19381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Here we show that, like RAD54, BLM can stimulate RAD51 strand exchange activity. However, the mechanisms of BLM and RAD54 stimulation of the RAD51 DNA strand exchange activity appeared to be different. In contrast with BLM, the ATPase activity of RAD54 protein is required for stimulation of RAD51 (47Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 55Sigurdsson S. Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42790-42794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It was suggested that RAD54 protein stimulates RAD51 by promoting binding and ATPase-dependent translocation of dsDNA during the search for homologous sequence. An ATP independence of RAD51 stimulation by BLM observed in this study likely excludes a role of DNA translocation in RAD51 stimulation by BLM. Also, in contrast to RAD54 and HOP2/MND1, BLM apparently does not stimulate dsDNA binding by the RAD51-ssDNA filament. However, the ATP independence of RAD51 stimulation does not necessarily exclude a role of the BLM helicase activity in this stimulation. It is known that ATP hydrolysis is required for DNA translocation of helicases rather than for duplex destabilization (49He X. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3024-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consequently, we suggest that BLM may stimulate RAD51 by promoting an ATPase-independent destabilization of DNA duplex during the search for homology. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that BLM catalyzes an ATPase-independent DNA strand exchange, albeit with a relatively low efficiency. The RAD51-ssDNA filament, an active species that promotes HR, exists in two major conformations, ADP-bound or inactive and ATP-bound or active (56Yu X. Jacobs S.A. West S.C. Ogawa T. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8419-8424Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We found that the conformational state of the RAD51-ssDNA filament plays an important role in interactions with BLM. We previously showed that BLM efficiently disrupts the RAD51-ssDNA filament when RAD51 is present in an inactive ADP-bound form (25Bugreev D.V. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Mazin A.V. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3085-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that stimulation of RAD51 by BLM requires the active ATP-bound conformation of the RAD51-ssDNA filament. We suggest that some stimulatory factors, such as accessory proteins (57Shim K.S. Schmutte C. Tombline G. Heinen C.D. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30385-30394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), specific co-factors, or proper ionic environment may stabilize the presynaptic RAD51-ssDNA filament, making it not only resistant for BLM disruption but also susceptible for BLM stimulation (Fig. 12). Thus, the conformational state of the RAD51-ssDNA filament may play a pivotal role in determining the outcome of the filament interaction with BLM and, as we have showed previously, with RAD54 (18Bugreev D.V. Hanaoka F. Mazin A.V. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 58Rossi M.J. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24698-24706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The observed dependence of the BLM function on the filament conformation suggests that BLM may play a quality control function in HR. It may prevent premature initiation of recombination events by partially active RAD51 filament, but after filament activation BLM may stimulate DNA strand exchange, ensuring an efficient continuation of the proper HR. Further work is needed to determine the role of the observed stimulation of the RAD51 and DMC1 DNA strand exchange activity by BLM in vivo. We thank P. Sung, M. Wold, E. Golub, W. Holloman, and D.

Although iPLA1β has been implicated in organization of the ER-Golgi compartments, little is known about the physiological role of its closest paralog, iPLA1γ. Here we show that iPLA1γ mediates a specific retrograde membrane transport pathway between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex. iPLA1γ appeared to be localized to the cytosol, the cis-Golgi, and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Time-lapse microscopy revealed that a population of GFP-iPLA1γ was associated with transport carriers moving out from the Golgi complex. Knockdown of iPLA1γ expression by RNAi did not affect the anterograde transport of VSVGts045 but dramatically delayed two types of Golgi-to-ER retrograde membrane transport; that is, transfer of the Golgi membrane into the ER in the presence of brefeldin A and delivery of cholera toxin B subunit from the Golgi complex to the ER. Notably, knockdown of iPLA1γ did not impair COPI- and Rab6-dependent retrograde transports represented by ERGIC-53 recycling and ER delivery of Shiga toxin, respectively.

Although PLA1 activity had been detected widely in many cells and tissues, its physiological function and the molecules responsible for this enzymatic activity had been unclear for a long time (1Inoue A.

It exhibited PLA1 activity toward phosphatidic acid (PA) and was named PA-preferring PLA1 (PA-PLA1) (3Higgs H.N. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Molecular cloning of PA-PLA1 revealed that intracellular PLA1 (iPLA1) forms a protein family well conserved throughout eukaryotes (5Higgs H.N. Han M.H. Johnson G.E. Glomset J.A. J. Biol.

Mammals have three intracellular PLA1 homologs: PA-PLA1, p125, and KIAA0725p. p125 was originally identified in a search for a new membrane transport factor that interacts with Sec23p (10Tani K. Mizoguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20505-20512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). KIAA0725p was afterward identified as a close paralog of p125 by a database search (11Nakajima K. Sonoda H. Mizoguchi T. Aoki J. Arai H. Nagahama M. Tagaya M. Tani K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11329-11335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because these proteins were identified in different studies with different strategies, they were named based on discrete properties such as in vitro substrate, the molecular size, and the gene number in the cDNA screening project. For clarification, we propose here a unified nomenclature for these mammalian iPLA1s (PA-PLA1 as iPLA1α, p125 as iPLA1β, and KIAA0725p as iPLA1γ), according to the order of their identification. Hereafter we adopt this new nomenclature. In addition to the three mammalian iPLA1s, iPLA1 genes are found in various eukaryotic model organisms. Studies of these homologs suggest that iPLA1 family proteins contribute to diverse biological processes but are generally regulators of membrane dynamics. For example, SGR2, an iPLA1 homolog in Arabidopsis thaliana, was reported to be involved in plant shoot gravitropism probably through regulating vacuolar membrane dynamics in gravity-sensing cells (9Kato T. Morita M.T. Fukaki H. Yamauchi Y. Uehara M. Niihama M. Tasaka M. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). ipla-1 of Caenorhabditis elegans regulates stem cell division and genetically interacts with genes involved in endosome-to-Golgi membrane transport (8Kanamori T.

Mammalian iPLA1β has been implicated in the ER-Golgi organization as shown by the following. 1) iPLA1β physically interacts with Sec23p, a component of COPII complex that plays a crucial role in vesicle formation at the ER exit sites and is also localized to these compartments. 2) Overexpression of iPLA1β disrupts the structures of the Golgi complex and the ERGIC. 3) Knockdown of iPLA1β by RNAi causes changes in distribution of the ER exit sites (10Tani K.

Because iPLA1γ shows high homology to iPLA1β and because overexpression of iPLA1γ, like overexpression of iPLA1β, leads to disorganization of ER-Golgi compartments (11Nakajima K. Sonoda H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11329-11335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), iPLA1β and -γ appear to play similar roles in ER-Golgi membrane transport or maintenance. However, it should be noted that iPLA1γ does not interact with Sec23p, to which iPLA1β binds (11Nakajima K. Sonoda H. Mizoguchi T. Aoki J. Arai H. Nagahama M. Tagaya M. Tani K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11329-11335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, iPLA1γ exhibits extensive PLA1 activity toward various phospholipids in vitro (10Tani K.

Methods Enzymol. 2007; 434: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), whereas iPLA1β has not yet been shown any detectable PLA1 activity. Thus, the physiological role of iPLA1γ has remained obscure. Phospholipid is a major constituent of biomembranes, and phospholipid and its metabolism have been proposed to play important roles in regulation of membrane dynamics (14Bankaitis V.A. Aitken J.R.

Cell. 2003; 14: 3459-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have shown using phospholipid metabolism inhibitors that specific phospholipid metabolisms are involved in the ER-Golgi membrane transport. For example, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitors such as ONO-RS-082 and BEL blocked the constitutive Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport. CI-976, an inhibitor of lysophospholipid acyltransferase, caused Golgi membrane tubulation and transfer into the ER. These studies predicted that phospholipid deacylation promotes and, conversely, reacylation inhibits retrograde transport between the ER and the Golgi complex. However, the enzyme responsible for these phenomena has not been identified. It does not appear to be cytosolic or intracellular PLA2 because cytosolic and intracellular PLA2 knock-out mice are viable and grow normally. It must be also noted that the inhibitors used in the experiments above affect a broad range of phospholipases or acyltransferases. Thus, it is possible that PLA1 contributes to the Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport. The presently best characterized Golgi-to-ER pathways involve the COPI complex and Rab6. COPI is a coatomer complex that mediates vesicle formation at the ERGIC/cis-Golgi compartments. COPI-coated vesicles retrieve ER-resident proteins with specific signals (KKXX for membrane proteins and KDEL for luminal proteins) from the post-ER compartments and carry them back to the ER (25Lee M.C. Miller E.A. Goldberg J. Orci L. Schekman R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 87-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 26Sannerud R. Saraste J. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Rab6 is a small G protein localized to the Golgi membranes and has recently been shown to mediate COPI-independent Golgi-to-ER transport of a Golgi-resident enzyme and a protein toxin, Shiga toxin (Stx) (27Girod A. Storrie B. Simpson J.C. Johannes L. Goud B. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Nilsson T. Pepperkok R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 28White J. Johannes L.

Other Golgi-to-ER retrograde pathways have been also suggested (29Chen A. AbuJarour R.J. Draper R.K. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3503-3510Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although their components are unknown. In this study we demonstrate that iPLA1γ is localized to the cis-Golgi and ERGIC and involved in Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport. Moreover, we show that this pathway is distinct from the previously characterized COPI- and Rab6-dependent pathways. Our results provide not only new information on iPLA1 family but also insights into a novel retrograde transport pathway regulated by a newly emerging lipid-metabolizing enzyme. Anti-iPLA1γ rat monoclonal antibodies (3G1 and 8F12) were generated as follows. Briefly, a polypeptide (amino acid number 368–486 of human iPLA1γ) was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli, and the purified protein was used to immunize rats (WKY/Izm). The medial iliac lymph nodes from the rats were used for cell fusion with mouse myeloma cells, PAI. Two hybridoma clones were established, 3G1 and 8F12. 3G1 recognized human and mouse iPLA1γ in Western blotting. 8F12 was reactive to human, mouse, and Chinese hamster iPLA1γ in both Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. The following antibodies were also used: mouse anti-GS28 and anti-GM130 monoclonal antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories), mouse anti-β-COP antibody maD (Sigma), mouse anti-ERGIC-53 monoclonal antibody (kindly donated by Dr. H. P. Hauri, University of Basel, Switzerland), anti-GFP antibody (kindly provided by Dr. N. Nakamura, Kanazawa University, Japan), mouse anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody DM1A (Sigma). Stx and rabbit anti-Stx polyclonal antibody were kindly donated by Dr. K. Nishikawa and Dr. Y. Natori (International Medical Center of Japan). All fluorescent Alexa-labeled secondary antibodies and Alexa 594-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit (CtxB) were obtained from Molecular Probes. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were obtained from either GE Healthcare or American Qualex. Brefeldin A and Geneticin were obtained from Sigma and Invitrogen. cDNAs encoding human iPLA1γ and human ϵCOP were cloned into pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech) to generate GFP-iPLA1γ and GFP-ϵCOP. cDNA encoding amino acids 1–60 of mouse GT was cloned into pEGFP-N1 vector to generate GFP-tagged galactosyltransferase (GT-GFP). To generate GFP-ERGIC-53, pssGFP vector was first established by inserting the signal sequence of Chinese hamster ERGIC-53 (p58) in front of the cDNA for EGFP in pEGFP-C1. The cDNA encoding Chinese hamster ERGIC-53 lacking the signal sequence was then inserted into the multicloning site of pssGFP vector. The cDNA encoding GFP-tagged ts045 vesicular stomatitis virus protein (VSVGts045-GFP) was a gift from Dr. J. Lippincott-Schwartz (National Institutes of Health). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Stably transfected CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 300 μg/ml Geneticin. Cells at subconfluency were transfected with plasmids carrying the indicated cDNAs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For iPLA1γ knockdown experiments, HeLa cells at subconfluency were transfected with siRNA against iPLA1γ mRNA (GGAUGAGUAUGGACCUUAAGAACAA) and either scrambled siRNA (UGGAUAUGUACACAAGAGAUAGGAC) or SilencerTM Negative Control #1 siRNA (Ambion) as a control using Lipofectamine 2000. The day after, transfection cells were passaged to fresh dishes and allowed to grow for another 48 h before experiments were started. To establish GFP-iPLA1γ stably expressing CHO cells, GFP-iPLA1γ was transfected to CHO cells, and stably expressing cells were selected in complete medium containing 300 μg/ml Geneticin. For immunofluorescent staining, cells were grown on either 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes (Iwaki) or glass coverslips and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm Pipes-KOH, pH 7.2, 3.6 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2 for 30 min. After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, cells were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin-containing PBS for 1 h. After blocking, cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h and subsequently with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h. The samples were observed with a confocal microscope, LSM510 (Carl Zeiss). Time-lapse imaging was also performed with the same confocal microscope system. Sequential images were acquired every 3 s by scanning the specimen with a low powered laser (3%) at room temperature. Cells cultured on plastic coverslips (Celldesk LF1, Sumitomo Bakelite) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 h and then subjected to the pre-embedded gold enhancement immunogold method using an anti-GFP antibody as previously described (30Luo H. Nakatsu F. Furuno A. Kato H. Yamamoto A. Ohno H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2006; 31: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ultra-thin sections were prepared and observed with H-7600 (Hitachi). Cells were transfected with VSVGts045-GFP followed by incubation at 39 °C for 16 h to allow VSVGts045 to accumulate in the ER. Then the cells were transferred to 32 °C to start the transport of VSVGts045. After incubation for various times, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and examined by confocal microscopy. Quantitative analysis was carried out by counting cells in which VSVGts045-GFP was localized at the ER, the Golgi complex, or the plasma membrane. Localization of VSVGts045-GFP at the ER and the Golgi complex was judged by its nuclear ring plus a network pattern typical for the ER and stacked Golgi pattern at the perinuclear region. CtxB and Stx transport assays were performed with essentially the same procedure. Cells were incubated in medium containing Alexa 594-conjugated CtxB or non-labeled Stx on ice for 30 min to bind the toxins to the cell surface. After extensive washing with PBS to remove the unbound toxins, the cells were incubated in normal medium at 37 °C to allow the toxins to transport from the plasma membrane to the ER via the Golgi complex. After incubation for various time periods, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and then the localization of the toxins were examined. Alexa 594 conjugated to CtxB was detectable by confocal microscopy after fixation. Stx taken up by the cells was immunostained using an anti-Stx antibody to visualize its localization. For examining localization of the toxins at the Golgi complex, the cells were co-stained with an anti-GM130 antibody as a Golgi marker. Localization of the toxins at ER was judged by the appearance of the nuclear ring pattern. The Golgi membrane was visualized by transfecting cDNA for GT-GFP. GT-GFP-transfected cells were treated with 10 μg/ml BFA for the indicated times and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The cells were observed under confocal microscopy. For morphometric analysis, the appearance of the Golgi membrane was classified into four stages: (a) Golgi, (b) Golgi + tubules, (c) tubules + ER, and (d) ER. The percentages of the cells in each stage were quantified at each time point. Cells expressing GFP-ϵCOP or GFP-ERGIC-53 were grown on 35-mm glass-based dishes (Iwaki) and set on a stage of a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. The Golgi area was repeatedly photobleached (50 scans) using an argon laser (488 nm) with 100% laser power. After bleaching, sequential images were acquired to monitor the fluorescence recovery by scanning with low laser power (1%). The fluorescence intensity of the bleached Golgi area was measured using the Zeiss software. The resulting fluorescence recovery rates of ERGIC-53 and ϵCOP represent the recycling speed between the Golgi and the ER/ERGIC and the recruiting speed between a membrane and cytosolic pool, respectively. To define subcellular localization of iPLA1γ, we first examined the biochemical distribution of iPLA1γ in fractionated HeLa cell lysates. 70–80% of the total iPLA1γ was in the soluble fraction, and the rest was in the detergent-soluble membrane fraction (Fig. 1A). Because iPLA1 family proteins lack a signal sequence at the N terminus, iPLA1γ is deduced to be a cytosolic and peripheral membrane protein. The localization of iPLA1γ was further analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. iPLA1γ appeared to be localized mainly to the cytosol and the Golgi complex, which was confirmed by colocalization with a Golgi marker GS28 (Fig. 1B, top). To examine the cellular localization of iPLA1γ in living cells, we established a CHO cell line stably expressing GFP-tagged iPLA1γ (CHO-GFP-iPLA1γ). In these cells the protein expression level of GFP-iPLA1γ was more than 30-fold that of the endogenous iPLA1γ level of wild-type CHO cells (supplemental Fig. S1). However, the Golgi complex and the ERGIC were not perturbed in these cells as revealed by immunofluorescence of GM130, GS28, and ERGIC-53 (supplemental Fig. S2). In addition, distribution patterns of ER-Golgi membrane transport factors such as β-COP, Rab6, and ERGIC-53 were not changed in these cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, it seems that transport between the ER and the Golgi complex is intact in CHO-GFP-iPLA1γ. Like the endogenous iPLA1γ in HeLa cells, GFP-iPLA1γ was localized to the Golgi complex and the cytosol in these cells (Fig. 1B, bottom). Notably, GFP-iPLA1γ was additionally found in punctate structures of various sizes (0.2–0.8 μm) that did not contain the Golgi marker GS28 (Fig. 1B, bottom inset). To characterize these structures, CHO-GFP-iPLA1γ cells were stained with antibodies against four organelle markers; EEA1 for early endosomes, cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor for late endosomes/lysosomes, transferrin receptor for recycling endosomes, and ERGIC-53 for the ERGIC. Among these markers, ERGIC-53 overlapped with some of the GFP-iPLA1γ-positive puncta (Fig. 1C). To further determine the precise localization of iPLA1γ, we performed electron microscopic analysis of CHO-GFP-iPLA1γ cells using an anti-GFP antibody. Consistent with the immunofluorescence observations, immunogold-labeled GFP-iPLA1γ was found both in the cytosol and on the Golgi membranes. In the Golgi complex, the signal was specifically concentrated on the cis-side (Fig. 1D, left and middle). The Golgi stacks with high expression of GFP-iPLA1γ were often swelled (Fig. 1D, left), probably reflecting the disorganizing effect of iPLA1γ overexpression. Strong signals were also detected at clusters of tubules and vesicles near the ER. These structures represent the ERGIC, which is also known as the vesicular tubular complex based on its appearance at the ultrastructural level (31Appenzeller-Herzog C. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2173-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 32Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 33Klumperman J.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 517-528PubMed Google Scholar). The ER tubules around these clusters, however, did not show significant positive signals (Fig. 1D, right), corroborating that iPLA1γ is associated with the ERGIC but not with the ER exit sites. Although GFP-iPLA1γ was localized to the ERGIC, endogenous iPLA1γ did not appear to be distributed to the ERGIC in the immunofluorescence observations (Fig. 1B). To address the association of endogenous iPLA1γ with the ERGIC, we analyzed its localization at low temperature. At 15 °C, delivery of proteins from the ERGIC to the Golgi is blocked, resulting in accumulation of ER-Golgi recycling proteins in the ERGIC (33Klumperman J. Schweizer A. Clausen H. Tang B.L. Hong W. Oorschot V. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3411-3425PubMed Google Scholar, 35Saraste J. Kuismanen E. Cell. 1984; 38: 535-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, endogenous iPLA1γ showed marked colocalization with ERGIC-53 after 3 h of incubation at 15 °C, supporting the idea that endogenous iPLA1γ associates with the ERGIC. A similar distribution pattern was observed for GFP-iPLA1γ in CHO cells at 15 °C (Fig. 2B). We next performed live imaging of GFP-iPLA1γ using confocal microcopy. The GFP-iPLA1γ localized to a Golgi region, punctate or globular structures (0.50 ± 0.13 μm) with low or little mobility, and highly mobile dot-like structures (0.35 ± 0.16 μm), which are likely transport carriers (Fig. 3A and a supplemental movie). It appears that some of these mobile structures have tubular protrusions that are small and very transient. Notably, we occasionally observed GFP-iPLA1γ-positive structures (0.35 ± 0.05 μm) that arose from the Golgi region and traveled toward the cell periphery (Fig. 3B and a supplemental movie). Most of these structures disappeared in the peripheral region, possibly representing a release of iPLA1γ from the membrane upon a fusion of the carrier with target organelles. These data suggest that iPLA1γ is associated with not only the cis-Golgi and the ERGIC but also highly dynamic transport carriers. Given the association of iPLA1γ with the ERGIC and cis-Golgi, we tested whether iPLA1γ plays a role in membrane transport between the ER and the Golgi complex by examining both anterograde and retrograde transports in iPLA1γ-knockdown HeLa cells. Expression of iPLA1γ was suppressed by transfecting the cells with siRNA against iPLA1γ. The expression of iPLA1γ protein was decreased to less than 10% that of control siRNA-treated cells as shown by Western blotting (Fig. 4A). The structures of the ER, the ER exit sites/ERGIC, and Golgi compartments were not obviously altered by iPLA1γ knockdown as revealed by staining for organelle markers for these compartments (KDELR, ERGIC-53, and GM130, supplemental Fig. S3). As a marker for anterograde transport, we used VSVGts045-GFP. VSVGts045 is a tempera"
https://openalex.org/W2008344765,"Newly synthesized peroxisomal matrix proteins are targeted to the organelle by PEX5, the peroxisomal cycling receptor. Over the last few years, valuable data on the mechanism of this process have been obtained using a PEX5-centered in vitro system. The data gathered until now suggest that cytosolic PEX5.cargo protein complexes dock at the peroxisomal docking/translocation machinery, where PEX5 becomes subsequently inserted in an ATP-independent manner. This PEX5 species is then monoubiquitinated at a conserved cysteine residue, a mandatory modification for the next step of the pathway, the ATP-dependent dislocation of the ubiquitin-PEX5 conjugate back into the cytosol. Finally, the ubiquitin moiety is removed, yielding free PEX5. Despite its usefulness, there are many unsolved mechanistic aspects that cannot be addressed with this in vitro system and that call for a cargo protein-centered perspective instead. Here we describe a robust peroxisomal in vitro import system that provides this perspective. The data obtained with it suggest that translocation of a cargo protein across the peroxisomal membrane, including its release into the organelle matrix, occurs prior to PEX5 ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W1984797695,"Malignant gliomas have a distinctive ability to infiltrate the brain parenchyma and disrupt the neural extracellular matrix that inhibits motility of axons and normal neural cells. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are among the major inhibitory components in the neural matrix, but surprisingly, some are up-regulated in gliomas and act as pro-invasive signals. In the normal brain, CSPGs are thought to associate with hyaluronic acid and glycoproteins such as the tenascins and link proteins to form the matrix scaffold. Here, we examined for the first time the expression of link proteins in human brain and malignant gliomas. Our results indicate that HAPLN4 and HAPLN2 are the predominant members of this family in the adult human brain but are strongly reduced in the tumor parenchyma. To test if their absence was related to a pro-invasive gain of function of CSPGs, we expressed HAPLN4 in glioma cells in combination with the CSPG brevican. Surprisingly, HAPLN4 increased glioma cell adhesion and migration and even potentiated the motogenic effect of brevican. Further characterization revealed that HAPLN4 expressed in glioma cells was largely soluble and did not reproduce the strong, hyaluronan-independent association of the native protein to brain subcellular membranes. Taken together, our results suggest that the tumor parenchyma is rich in CSPGs that are not associated to HAPLNs and could instead interact with other extracellular matrix proteins produced by glioma cells. This dissociation may contribute to changes in the matrix scaffold caused by invasive glioma cells.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The major family of HA binding matrix glycoproteins in the central nervous system is formed by the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans of the lectican family (aggrecan, versican, neurocan, and brevican), the last two expressed almost exclusively in neural tissue (2Yamaguchi Y. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). These proteoglycans bind both to HA and to cell-surface receptors (3Viapiano M.S. Matthews R.T. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 488-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), regulating the cross-linking and compressibility of the matrix scaffold and, therefore, modulating many neural processes including cell motility during development, axonal navigation, and the stabilization of synapses (4Galtrey C.M. Fawcett J.W. Brain Res. Rev. 2007; 54: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The lecticans have been identified as a major class of molecules that restrict cellular and axonal motility in neural tissue and are a major component of the glial scar that forms after neural injury and prevents axonal regeneration (5Busch S.A. Silver J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). extracellular matrix chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan hyaluronan hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein reverse transcription analysis of variance 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. A second family of HA-binding proteins expressed in the central nervous system is formed by small glycoproteins known as HA- and proteoglycan-link proteins (HAPLNs) or, simply, “link proteins.” These glycoproteins bind both to HA and to the lecticans, forming ternary complexes (6Binette F. Cravens J. Kahoussi B. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19116-19122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 130: 635-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The structure of the link proteins is remarkably similar to the N-terminal region of the lecticans, and the highly homologous HA binding domains from HAPLNs and lecticans are indistinctly known as proteoglycan tandem repeats or link-protein modules. In a striking example of molecular evolution, the genes of the four HAPLNs are located adjacent to the genes of the four lecticans, indicating a common molecular origin by gene duplication (8Spicer A.P. Joo A. Bowling Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21083-21091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Two of the link proteins, HAPLN2 and HAPLN4, have only been detected in neural tissue, and their genes are adjacent to the neural-specific proteoglycans, brevican and neurocan, respectively (8Spicer A.P. Joo A. Bowling Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21083-21091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Both HAPLN2 and HAPLN4, also known as brain-specific link protein (Bral-1) and Bral-2, are up-regulated in the adult central nervous system and match the temporal expression profile of brevican, which is the most abundant CSPG in adult neural tissue (9Hirakawa S.

Ohtsuka A. Kang J.S. Sanders J. Murakami T. Ninomiya Y. Oohashi T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that the HAPLNs may be key components in the organization of the HA-based matrix scaffold. HAPLN1, the best studied member of the family, increases the affinity of the lecticans for HA (11Shi S. Grothe S. Zhang Y. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Poole A.R. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12060-12066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Rauch U. Hirakawa S. Oohashi T. Kappler J. Roos G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19116-19122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Neame P.J. Barry F.P. Experientia. 1993; 49: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Moreover, the increased expression of lecticans and HAPLNs in the adult central nervous system correlates temporally and spatially with changes in ECM solubility and with appearance of ECM aggregates around subsets of neurons, known as “perineuronal nets.” These changes have been associated with restricted cellular motility and decreased synaptic plasticity (14Rauch U. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2031-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The role of the lectican CSPGs as inhibitors of motility in the adult central nervous system contrasts starkly with their pro-invasive role in the highly aggressive brain tumors known as malignant gliomas. These are the most common primary tumors of the brain and are characterized by their extensive and diffuse infiltration of the brain parenchyma (15Louis D.N. Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2006; 1: 97-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), which makes them impossible to completely remove and facilitates tumor recurrence even after long term therapies. The invasive ability of gliomas is restricted to neural tissue and is not observed in other tumors that metastasize to the brain, suggesting that glioma invasion may be supported in part by unique mechanisms to remodel the neural microenvironment (16Bellail A.C. Hunter S.B. Brat D.J. Tan C. Van Meir E.G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1046-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Two lectican CSPGs, versican and the neural-specific CSPG brevican, are highly up-regulated in gliomas compared with normal brain tissue (3Viapiano M.S. Matthews R.T. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 488-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although these proteoglycans are thought to inhibit the motility of normal glial cells (17Thon N. Haas C.A.

Neurol. 2003; 182: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), they instead promote glioma cell adhesion and migration. The underlying molecular mechanisms for this unusual effect are poorly understood, although we and others have demonstrated that these lecticans can activate epidermal growth factor receptor signaling in glioma cells, which leads to an increase of cell-surface adhesion molecules (19Hu B. Kong L.L. Matthews R.T. Viapiano M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24848-24859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Both brevican and versican can also form adhesive complexes with mesenchymal matrix proteins that are present in the glioma ECM but absent from the normal neural ECM (19Hu B. Kong L.L. Matthews R.T. Viapiano M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24848-24859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Wu Y. Chen L. Cao L. Sheng W. Yang B.B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2227-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although the role of CSPGs in brain tumors is starting to become better defined, their HAPLN partners have never been analyzed in human brain or in neuropathologies. Therefore, we still have a highly incomplete picture of the molecular changes that occur in the tumor ECM and of how those changes could affect critical aspects of glioma biology such as invasion of the surrounding tissue. We hypothesized that the gain of function of CSPGs in gliomas could be associated with changes in the levels or molecular associations of specific HAPLNs in the ECM of gliomas. Thus, we studied here the expression and biochemical properties of the HAPLN family in human normal brain and glioma tissue. Our results provide the first biochemical characterization of the brain-specific human HAPLN4 and, in addition, show that both neural-specific link proteins HAPLN2 and HAPLN4, which are abundant in adult brain, are virtually absent from the ECM of malignant gliomas. The human glioma cell lines U251MG and U87MG (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown at 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to identify the major CSPGs produced endogenously by these cells. Non-transformed human fetal astrocytes (Clonetics Lonza, Allendale, NJ) were cultured in supplemented astrocyte basal medium provided by the manufacturer. Primary glioma-derived neurospheres prepared from fresh clinical specimens as described (21Lee J. Kotliarova S. Kotliarov Y. Li A. Su Q. Donin N.M. Pastorino S. Purow B.W. Christopher N. Zhang W.

Antonio Chiocca (Department of Neurological Surgery, The Ohio State University). These neurospheres were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 2 μm glutamine, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Peprotech), and 1× B27 supplement (Invitrogen). Culture medium in all cases was supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Human HAPLNs were detected with mouse monoclonal antibodies against HAPLN1 (clone 8A4, NICHD Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), HAPLN2 (Abnova, Taiwan) and HAPLN4 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Human CSPGs were detected with antibodies against versican (clone 12C5, NICHD Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB)), phosphacan (clone 3F8 against the core protein, NICHD DSHB), and brevican (rabbit polyclonal B6 and B5 that we have previously characterized (22Viapiano M.S. Bi W.L. Piepmeier J. Hockfield S. Matthews R.T. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6726-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). Chondroitin sulfate epitopes were detected after treating CSPGs samples with chondroitinase ABC using the antibodies anti-chondroitin-4-sulfate (clone BE123, Millipore, Temecula CA) and anti-6-sulfate (clone 3B3, Seikagaku, Japan). Actin and the V5-epitope tag were detected with mouse monoclonal antibodies from Sigma-Aldrich and Invitrogen, respectively. All studies involving human tissue specimens were performed in compliance with the guidelines of the Human Investigations Committee at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. Pathologically graded fresh-frozen surgical specimens of high grade adult gliomas (patient age range, 37–74 years old) were obtained through the NCI Cooperative Human Tissue Network. Human brain cortex tissue (parietal and temporal) from age-matched controls and other developmental stages was obtained from the NICHD Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders at the University of Maryland (Baltimore, MD). Tissues were individually homogenized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 320 mm sucrose and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Total homogenates were subjected to subcellular fractionation as previously described (22Viapiano M.S. Bi W.L. Piepmeier J. Hockfield S. Matthews R.T. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6726-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and further processed for protein electrophoresis. Clones containing the complete coding sequence of human HAPLN4 (NM_023002), human brevican (NM_021948), and the HA synthase HAS2 (NM_005328) were subcloned by PCR into the vector pcDNA3.1-V5.6xHis (Invitrogen) to produce V5/His-tagged proteins. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. cDNA dosage was controlled by quantitative RT-PCR, and cells were selected for further experiments when their stable expression levels were comparable with those in neural tissue (for HAPLN4) or glioma tissue (for brevican) as previously described (23Viapiano M.S. Hockfield S. Matthews R.T. J. Neurooncol. 2008; 88: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To confirm that protein overexpression was compatible with normal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function, we analyzed the expression of the ER stress sensor protein GRP78 and observed that this protein was not increased in the transfection conditions we used for our experiments. 3H. Sim, B. Hu, and M. S. Viapiano, unpublished observations. Control transfections were performed with the original pCDNA3.1 vector or, alternatively, with pDsRed2 (BD Biosciences) carrying the cDNA for red fluorescent protein. Transiently transfected cells employed for biochemical experiments were routinely changed to serum-free Opti-MEM culture medium (Invitrogen) 24 h after transfection followed by medium collection 24–48 h later. Stably transfected cells were selected with Geneticin (G418, Invitrogen) as previously described (23Viapiano M.S. Hockfield S. Matthews R.T. J. Neurooncol. 2008; 88: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 48-well plates were precoated for 2 h at room temperature with the following substrates: human fibronectin (5 μg/ml, BD Biosciences), high Mr poly-l-lysine (50 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), and high Mr hyaluronic acid (200 μg/ml, Calbiochem,). Nonspecific binding sites were subsequently blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Glioma cells were dissociated in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, 2 mm EDTA, washed in fresh culture medium, and plated on the precoated well (at 50,000 cells/well) for 30 min. Adhered cells were fixed and quantified by crystal violet staining as described (19Hu B. Kong L.L. Matthews R.T. Viapiano M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24848-24859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To analyze cell migration, we used a radial-dispersion assay to mimic cell dispersion away from the tumor bulk (24Chicoine M.R. Silbergeld D.L. J. Neurosurg. 1995; 82: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), a predominant feature of malignant brain tumors. Glioma cells were resuspended at a density of 100,000 cells/ml and seeded on 1% agar plates for 48 h to form floating aggregates. Aggregates were manually applied to the center of individual precoated wells, and cells were followed by time-lapse microscopy to analyze detachment and migration as described (25Stein A.M. Nowicki M.O. Demuth T. Berens M.E. Lawler S.E. Chiocca E.A. Sander L.M. Appl. Opt. 2007; 46: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The dispersion index (total area occupied by cells at each time divided by the original area of the cell aggregate) was plotted against time and analyzed by two-way ANOVA for repeated measures. As independent confirmation of cell motility, we tested the cells in a “wound-healing” assay using culture inserts with preformed gaps of 500 μm (Ibidi GmbH, Germany). Cells were plated at 60,000 cells/insert and allowed to form monolayers around the gaps overnight. Inserts were subsequently removed, and the residual gap area was measured at 0 and 24 h to quantify cell dispersion. Results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. All experiments in both motility models were repeated three times with three to six replicates per experimental condition. Microsomal fractions obtained from subcellular fractionation of human brain specimens were pooled and used as source of “total brain membranes” at a protein concentration of 1–2 mg of total protein/ml. Total membranes were resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, in the presence or absence of 10 mm EDTA or 1% w/v Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C. Alternatively, the membranes were resuspended in 100 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 11.0, for 30 min at 4 °C. To test whether HAPLN4 solubilized with Triton X-100 effectively partitioned with the aqueous phase, membranes were instead solubilized with cold 2% w/v Triton X-114 (Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described (26Viapiano M.S. Matthews R.T. Hockfield S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33239-33247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The resulting solution was warmed at 37 °C, causing the separation of aqueous and detergent-containing phases. All samples were subsequently diluted to reduce the Triton X-114 concentration before preparation for protein electrophoresis. To investigate the effect of glycosamino-glycan removal on protein solubilization, membranes were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm sodium acetate and protease inhibitors (CH buffer) and treated with 1 milliunits/μl protease-free chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4 Seikagaku) or 0.5 milliunits/μl hyaluronidase from Streptococcus dysgalactiae (EC 4.2.2, Seikagaku) for 4 h at 37 °C. To investigate the possible involvement of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor in HAPLN4 retention, membranes were resuspended in CH buffer and treated with 1 milliunit /μl protease-free chondroitinase ABC and 1 units/ml phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.10, Sigma-Aldrich) for 8 h at 37 °C. After any of these incubations the suspended membranes were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 15 min. Released proteins were recovered in the supernatant, and the membranes were washed twice in 25 mm Tris-HCl and re-centrifuged as before. Samples that had not been pretreated with chondroitinase were then further treated with 1 milliunit/ml chondroitinase ABC for 4 h at 37 °C to improve the resolution of CSPGs in blots. Samples were finally processed for protein electrophoresis. Subcellular fractions from brain tissue were prepared for electrophoresis using standard protocols. Cultured cells were first lysed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% w/v CHAPS, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete). Conditioned, serum-free, culture medium was concentrated and, if required, treated with chondroitinase ABC as previously described (22Viapiano M.S. Bi W.L. Piepmeier J. Hockfield S. Matthews R.T. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6726-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cell and tissue samples containing 15–20 μg of total protein were electrophoresed on 4–10% gradient polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blotting. Samples processed for mRNA analysis were snap-frozen immediately after dissection or culture followed by extraction in Trizol (Invitrogen). Residual DNA was degraded using Turbo-DNA Free (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and total RNA was processed for RT-PCR PCR using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. When possible, primers were designed to span gene introns and, thus, detect contamination with genomic DNA. Primers are listed in supplemental Table 1. mRNA expression data for the members of the lectican and HAPLN families were obtained from 295 grade II-IV glioma specimens and 30 controls stored in the NCI Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT, rembrandt.nci.nih.gov, accessed between January and December 2008). Expression values were collected for “unified gene” probe sets corresponding to the different splice forms of each gene (27Madhavan S. Zenklusen J.C. Kotliarov Y. Sahni H. Fine H.A. Buetow K. Mol. Cancer Res. 2009; 7: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Values were plotted as the -fold level (i.e. log 2 ratio) of each tumor to control samples and analyzed by one-way ANOVA for each gene. To normalize the expression of each gene using neuronal markers, values were recalculated relative to the expression level of the genes ENO2 (neuron-specific enolase) and TUBB4 (neuron-specific β-tubulin III) for each sample. Previous studies have confirmed the expression of the link proteins HAPLN1, -2, and -4 in rodent neural tissues (10Bekku Y. Su W.D. Hirakawa S. Fässler R. Ohtsuka A. Kang J.S. Sanders J. Murakami T. Ninomiya Y. Oohashi T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Oohashi T. Hirakawa S. Bekku Y. Rauch U. Zimmermann D.R. Su W.D. Ohtsuka A. Murakami T.

Neurosci. 2008; 27: 1373-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), but no comparison of these link proteins has yet been made in human central nervous system. To determine which members of the HAPLN family were expressed in human brain cortex, we first compared their expression by quantitative RT-PCR in adult tissue (Fig. 1A). Our results indicated that the neural-specific HAPLN4 was the largely predominant member of this family in human brain cortex, in agreement with what has been observed in rat and mouse brain. Processing of additional tissue samples revealed that the ranking HAPLN4 ≫ HAPLN2 > HAPLN1 ≫ HAPLN3 was consistent in different regions of the brain and spinal cord (not shown). This prompted us to focus mostly on HAPLN4 as the most abundant, but largely unexplored, member of this family in human central nervous system. Western blotting analysis of the developmental profile of HALPN4 in human brain cortex showed a low expression of this protein in fetal tissue, which increased significantly during the first postnatal year (Fig. 1B). HAPLN4 was not found at developmental ages earlier than 19 weeks of gestation, and not all 19-week samples yielded positive results (not shown), suggesting that this could be the starting point for expression of the protein. In rodents, the postnatal time-course of HAPLN4 follows closely that of brevican, the predominant lectican in adult neural tissue (2Yamaguchi Y. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In agreement, brevican and HAPLN4 followed very similar postnatal expression profiles in human brain cortex, including a peak during adolescence and late fall in adulthood that has been previously observed for brevican in human but not in rat brain (30Gary S.C. Zerillo C.A. Chiang V.L. Gaw J.U. Gray G. Hockfield S. Gene. 2000; 256: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, our results indicated that brevican protein appeared in human brain at earlier developmental stages than HAPLN4 (Fig. 2B), matching the early embryonic expression of this lectican in the rat (26Viapiano M.S. Matthews R.T. Hockfield S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33239-33247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1352-1362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, although brevican started as a largely soluble protein and remained partially soluble throughout human brain development (22Viapiano M.S. Bi W.L. Piepmeier J. Hockfield S. Matthews R.T. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6726-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), HAPLN4 became aggregated and/or strongly membrane-associated within the first year of postnatal life, and there was virtually no soluble form of this protein in the adult brain (see further analysis below). Next, we compared the expression of the link proteins in normal adult brain versus high grade malignant gliomas, which are known for their high expression of two members of the lectican family, versican and brevican (3Viapiano M.S. Matthews R.T. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 488-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For this, we first analyzed microarray data from glioma specimens stored in the NCI Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT), which is used to identify specific patterns of gene expression in primary brain tumors (27Madhavan S. Zenklusen J.C. Kotliarov Y. Sahni H. Fine H.A. Buetow K. Mol. Cancer Res. 2009; 7: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This analysis disclosed a strong decrease in mRNA levels for the neural-specific link proteins HAPLN2 and HAPLN4 in high grade gliomas, a notorious contrast against the up-regulation of the lecticans versican and brevican in the same types of tumors (Fig. 2A). When the expression patterns were expressed relative to the levels of two neuron-specific markers in each sample (supplemental Fig. 1), both HAPLN2 and HAPLN4 remained unchanged in tumor versus non-tumor tissue, suggesting that their decrease matched the death of adult neurons in tissue invaded by glioma. To validate our analysis of microarray data, we quantified the expression of the proteins HAPLN1, -2, and -4 in total homogenates of normal brain cortex and glioma tissue by Western blotting (Fig. 2, B–C). Results indicated that both HAPLN2 and HAPLN4 were virtually absent from the tumor parenchyma compared with normal brain. Remarkably, HAPLN1, which had not appeared significantly down-regulated at the mRNA level, was also strongly reduced at the protein level. We further analyzed and characterized the expression of CSPGs and HAPLNs in glioma cell lines and found that although expression of some CSPGs was maintained, link proteins were absent in glioma cells (supplemental Fig. 2). However, we were able to detect both HAPLN2 and HAPLN4 mRNA in short term primary cultures of normal human astrocytes (Fig. 2D). Moreover, we detected HAPLN4 by RT-PCR (not shown) and Western blotting (Fig. 2E) in several cultures of primary glioma-derived neurospheres, which have been characterized as a source of glioma initiating cells that can express both neuronal and glial markers (21Lee J. Kotliarova S. Kotliarov Y. Li A. Su Q. Donin N.M. Pastorino S. Purow B.W. Christopher N. Zhang W. Park J.K. Fine H.A. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 391-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Even though the detected levels were much lower than in adult brain, the results suggested that HAPLNs might not be completely restricted to adult neurons and could be expressed in minor populations of glial/glioma cells. Because lecticans and HAPLNs co-localize and are thought to associate in"

The FA pathway consists of an upstream FA core complex containing at least eight proteins (FANCA, -B, -C, -E, -F, -G, -L, and -M) that is required for the DNA damage-induced monoubiquitination of two downstream proteins, FANCD2 and FANCI. Although the molecular function of the FA pathway is unknown, the identification of additional FA genes FANCD1 (BRCA2), FANCN (PALB2), and the DNA helicase FANCJ (BRIP1) as breast cancer (BRCA) susceptibility genes suggests convergence of the FA/BRCA pathway with a larger network of proteins involved in DNA repair (reviewed in Ref. 1Wang W.

ATR-dependent phosphorylation of FANCD2 is triggered by various types of DNA damage, including replication stress, and is required for the interstrand cross-link-induced intra-S phase checkpoint response (2Pichierri P.

FANCM is a homolog of the archaebacterial Hef protein (helicase-associated endonuclease for fork-structured DNA) and contains two DNA processing domains: a DEAH box helicase domain and an XPF/ERCC4-like endonuclease domain. FANCM has ATP-dependent DNA translocase activity and can dissociate DNA triple helices in vitro (8Meetei A.R. Medhurst A.L. Ling C. Xue Y. Singh T.R. Bier P. Steltenpool J. Stone S. Dokal I. Mathew C.G. Hoatlin M. Joenje H. de Winter J.P. Wang W. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Moreover, FANCM binds Holliday junctions and DNA replication fork structures in vitro and promotes ATP-dependent branch point migration, suggesting that FANCM might be involved in DNA processing at stalled replication forks (10Gari K.

Genet. 2008; 17: 1641-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In human cells, FANCM localizes to chromatin and is required for chromatin recruitment of other FA core complex proteins (8Meetei A.R. Medhurst A.L. Ling C. Xue Y. Singh T.R. Bier P. Steltenpool J.

Kim J.M. D'Andrea A.D. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of FANCM is independent of the FA core complex (8Meetei A.R. Medhurst A.L. Ling C. Xue Y. Singh T.R. Bier P. Steltenpool J. Stone S. Dokal I. Mathew C.G. Hoatlin M. Joenje H. de Winter J.P. Wang W. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), suggesting that FANCM is controlled by other, as yet unknown upstream components of the DNA damage response. Here, we used cell-free Xenopus egg extracts to investigate the role of FANCM during replication and in the DNA damage response. We show that Xenopus FANCM (xFANCM) binds chromatin in a replication-dependent manner and is phosphorylated during unperturbed replication as well as in response to various DNA damage structures. Both chromatin recruitment and phosphorylation of xFANCM are partially controlled by xFANCD2, suggesting feedback signaling from xFANCD2 to the upstream xFA core complex via regulation of xFANCM. In addition, chromatin recruitment during unperturbed replication and activation of xFANCM in response to DNA damage are controlled by the xATR and xATM cell cycle kinases. Tblastn-based searches were performed at NCBI and JGI as described previously (14Sobeck A. Stone S. Costanzo V. de Graaf B. Reuter T. de Winter J. Wallisch M. Akkari Y. Olson S. Wang W. Joenje H.

Several short homologous protein fragments were identified using a tblast search with full-length human FANCM in both NCBI and a Xenopus tropicalis data base (JGI). Primers designed from these sequences were used in reverse transcription-PCR to amplify a large fragment of FANCM spanning approximately two-thirds of the FANCM coding region, including the stop codon. The amplified fragment was sequences and primers were designed for 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCRs. Full-length X. laevis FANCM (xFANCM) was amplified using primers 5′-ATGAGTGGGAAACAGAAAACACTTTTTCA-3′ and 5′-TTAAGAGACTCTGCTTCGCTTAGTGGGGTT-3′. Cloning and sequencing of xFANCD2 was described previously (14Sobeck A. Stone S. Costanzo V. de Graaf B. Reuter T. de Winter J. Wallisch M. Akkari Y. Olson S. Wang W. Joenje H. Christian J.L.

To construct a baculoviral vector expressing full-length glutathione S-transferase-tagged xFANCD2, the xFANCD2 coding region was subcloned from the pDONR201 vector into pDEST20 of the Gateway Cloning System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This vector encodes for a glutathione S-transferase tag, which was used for subsequent purification using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare). Glutathione S-transferase-tagged xFANCD2 protein was expressed in SF9 insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Generation of antibodies against xFANCA and xFANCD2 has been described previously (14Sobeck A. Stone S. Costanzo V. de Graaf B. Reuter T. de Winter J. Wallisch M. Akkari Y. Olson S. Wang W. Joenje H.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against xFANCM were generated using a mix of N- and C-terminal peptide regions of xFANCM. The resulting antiserum was used for Western blots at 1:1000 dilutions and for immunodepletions as described later. Antibodies for depletion of xATRIP, neutralization of xATR, and Western blot detection of xRad1 and phosphorylated xChk1 (xChk1 phosphorylated at serine 344) were a kind gift from K. Cimprich. Antibodies to xCdc45 were a kind gift from J. Walter, and antibodies to xRPA70 were a kind gift from W. Dunphy. Commercial antibodies were used against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (sc-56; Santa Cruz), histone H3 (1791; abcam), γ-H2AX (A300-081 A; Bethyl Laboratories), and hChk1 (Cell Signaling Technology). Extracts were prepared from Xenopus eggs according to the method of Murray (15Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Tautomycin (3 μm) and recombinant Xenopus geminin (5 μg/μl) were added as indicated. Plasmid DNA was used at 150 ng/μl, as described before (16Sobeck A. Stone S. Hoatlin M.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 4283-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The nuclei and chromatin fractions were essentially prepared as described before (14Sobeck A. Stone S.

Briefly, identical aliquots (20 to 50 μl) of egg extracts containing 2000 pronuclei (sperm heads)/μl were each diluted in nuclear isolation buffer (40 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2) or chromatin isolation buffer (40 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100) and purified through a 30% (w/v) sucrose cushion. Nuclear and chromatin pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Replication of sperm chromatin in S phase extracts was monitored as described before (14Sobeck A. Stone S.

For plasmid DNA, circular plasmid DNA (pBSKS) was prepared from Escherichia coli cultures using a QiaFilter Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen). For DNA damage structures, the preparation of oligonucleotide-derived DNA structures was done as described previously (16Sobeck A. Stone S. Hoatlin M.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 4283-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).

In brief, 200 μl of protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow beads (50% slurry; GE Healthcare) were rotated overnight at 4 °C with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and 100 μl of anti-xFANCA, -xFANCD2, -xFANCM, -xATRIP, or -xATR affinity-purified or raw sera or preimmune sera. The beads were pelleted and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and twice with XB buffer. For depletion, 100 μl of extract was added to the beads and rotated for three rounds at 4 °C for 45 min each. Protein samples were separated on gradient gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore). After being blocked with 5% milk for 1 h, the membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies: xFANCA (1:1000), xFANCD2 (1:2500), xFANCM (1:1000), xCdc45 (1:2000), xATRIP (1:1000), xATR (1:5000), xChk1-P-Ser344 (1:800), hChk1-P-Ser345 (1: 1000), xRAD1 (1:2000), xRPA70 (1:1500), histone H3 (1:2500), or gamma-H2AX (1:3000). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) was used (1:10,000). The protein bands were visualized using an ECL Plus detection system (GE Healthcare). 2 μl of extract were incubated in a total volume of 20 μl containing 0.4 μl of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Fermentas) and 1× shrimp alkaline phosphatase buffer. Following incubation for 30 min, the reactions were stopped with 7 μl of 4× NuPAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen), and 10 μl/sample were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. For cloning of the X. laevis FANCM gene (xFANCM), we searched for Xenopus DNA sequences homologous to the human FANCM gene via NCBI BLAST (tblastn) search. Partial gene sequences were identified in sequence data bases for X. laevis and Xenopus tropicalis, and the full-length sequence for xFANCM was obtained by a combination of reverse transcription- and rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCRs (see “Experimental Procedures”). The predicted amino acid sequence of xFANCM is 2166 amino acids long and has an overall homology of 58% compared with its human counterpart. Two regions are highly conserved between human and Xenopus FANCM: the N-terminal DEAH helicase domain (86% homology; supplemental Fig. S1) and the C-terminal ERCC4/XPF-like endonuclease domain (79% homology; supplemental Fig. S2). Similar to the FANCM endonuclease domain in other species, the xFANCM endonuclease domain is degenerate at a conserved residue critical for nuclease function, suggesting that this domain of FANCM has lost this activity during evolution. Recent studies showed that human FANCM binds to chromatin and is phosphorylated during the S phase of the cell cycle and in response to DNA-damaging agents like mitomycin C or hydroxyurea (8Meetei A.R. Medhurst A.L. Ling C. Xue Y. Singh T.R. Bier P. Steltenpool J. Stone S. Dokal I. Mathew C.G. Hoatlin M. Joenje H. de Winter J.P. Wang W. Nat.

To analyze xFANCM chromatin recruitment during a synchronous S phase, we incubated Xenopus sperm chromatin in egg extracts that allow for nuclear assembly and DNA replication under natural cell cycle control. xFANCM associated with chromatin during chromosomal replication in egg extracts (Fig. 1A), and levels of chromatin-bound xFANCM increased in response to DNA-damaging agents mitomycin C and aphidicolin. 4A. Sobeck, S. Stone, I. Landais, B. de Graaf, and M. E. Hoatlin, unpublished data. Importantly, chromatin binding of xFANCM was abrogated in the presence of the replication initiation inhibitor geminin (Fig. 1A), indicating that xFANCM is recruited to chromatin in a strictly replication initiation-dependent manner, similar to other xFA proteins (FANCA, -F, -D2) (14Sobeck A. Stone S. Costanzo V. de Graaf B. Reuter T. de Winter J. Wallisch M. Akkari Y. Olson S. Wang W. Joenje H. Christian J.L. Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A. Gautier J. Hoatlin M.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To test whether xFANCM chromatin binding is dependent on the FA core complex during replication, we depleted xFANCA from egg extracts and tested for chromatin binding of xFANCM. As shown in Fig. 1B (upper panel), depletion of xFANCA partially co-depleted xFANCM (residual xFANCM protein levels, 30–40%), indicating that FANCM is only partially associated with the FA core complex in DNA-free egg extracts. Interestingly, the residual xFANCM was able to bind chromatin in xFANCA-depleted extracts (Fig. 1C), indicating that xFANCM can bind chromatin independently of the FA core complex. Our finding is in agreement with a recent study by Kim et al. (12Kim J.M. Kee Y. Gurtan A. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 2008; 111: 5215-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), showing that human FANCM is required for chromatin recruitment of the FA core complex. Together, these data indicate that FANCM acts upstream and independently of the other FA core complex proteins. We also tested whether chromatin-bound xFANCM is phosphorylated during replication. To trap phosphorylated protein isoforms (17Costanzo V. Robertson K. Bibikova M. Kim E. Grieco D. Gottesman M. Carroll D. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 137-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), we added tautomycin, a phosphatase inhibitor, to replicating extracts. Under these conditions, hyperphosphorylated forms of FANCM were detectable in the nuclear fractions, and the more heavily phosphorylated FANCM isoforms were found associated with replicating chromatin (Fig. 1D). In summary, our data support the idea that FANCM binds chromatin in a replication-dependent, but FA core complex-independent manner and is hyperphosphorylated during the unperturbed chromosomal replication process. The central FA pathway protein, FANCD2, is monoubiquitinated (FANCD2-Ub) during S phase and in response to DNA damage in human cells (18Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C.

Semin Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Using Xenopus egg extracts, we recently showed that although xFANCD2-Ub is recruited to chromatin in a replication-dependent manner, we can bypass the need for ongoing replication to trigger xFANCD2 monoubiquitination by adding dsDNA substrates, including circular double-stranded DNA (plasmid DNA), to egg extracts (16Sobeck A. Stone S. Hoatlin M.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 4283-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We tested whether xFANCM is also modified in response to plasmid DNA. As shown in Fig. 2A, a slower migrating form of both xFANCM and xFANCD2 was detected in extracts supplemented with plasmid DNA. Importantly, the addition of geminin to plasmid-containing extracts did not affect the xFANCM mobility shift, demonstrating that the plasmid-induced xFANCM modification is not due to plasmid replication in the extracts. Of note, the xFANCM mobility shift occurred at a later time point than the monoubiquitination of xFANCD2 (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 4) (see results below). To confirm that the slower mobility of plasmid-induced xFANCM isoforms was due to phosphorylation, we treated DNA plasmid-containing egg extracts with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 2B, phosphatase treatment of DNA-free and DNA-containing extracts revealed that both the noninduced and the DNA-induced isoform of xFANCM showed increased mobility during gel electrophoresis. Thus, xFANCM is already phosphorylated in DNA-free extracts and becomes hyperphosphorylated (xFANCM-PPP) in response to plasmid DNA. This result is consistent with the findings of Meetei et al. (8Meetei A.R. Medhurst A.L. Ling C. Xue Y. Singh T.R. Bier P. Steltenpool J. Stone S. Dokal I. Mathew C.G. Hoatlin M. Joenje H. de Winter J.P. Wang W. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) showing that in untreated human cells, FANCM exists as a phosphoprotein and is further phosphorylated in response to DNA damage. Moreover, our result supports the idea that the addition of circular plasmid to egg extracts at sufficiently high concentrations mimics the occurrence of DNA damage and triggers a DNA damage response that is uncoupled from ongoing replication (16Sobeck A. Stone S. Hoatlin M.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 4283-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In a recent study we used small DNA structures that mimic DNA damage intermediates at stalled replication forks to demonstrate that xFANCD2-Ub formation is triggered by linear and forked double-stranded DNA (dsDNA and forked double-stranded DNA, respectively) but not by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or Y-shaped DNA (16Sobeck A. Stone S. Hoatlin M.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 4283-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To test whether xFANCM-PPP formation is induced by the same DNA structures as xFANCD2-Ub, we incubated bead-coupled ssDNA, dsDNA, forked double-stranded DNA, and Y-shaped DNA structures in egg extracts, reisolated the bead DNA, and analyzed for bound xFANCD2-Ub and xFANCM-PPP. As expected from our previous findings, xFANCD2-Ub was induced only by linear dsDNA (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 5) and very strongly by forked double-stranded DNA (Fig. 2C, lanes 8 and 9). In contrast to the response of xFANCD2, xFANCM was phosphorylated when bound to all four DNA structures (Fig. 2C, lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9, in the presence of tautomycin), suggesting that unlike xFANCD2-Ub, xFANCM-PPP is generally triggered by single- or double-stranded DNA in a DNA structure-independent manner. However, higher levels of FANCM-PPP were associated with the linear and forked dsDNA structures compared with the ssDNA and Y-shaped DNA structures, indicating that xFANCM-PPP might be stabilized when bound to dsDNA and forked double-stranded DNA structures. Monoubiquitination of FANCD2 is a central FA pathway step and is controlled by the upstream FA core complex. In agreement with this, depletion of xFA core complex proteins, including xFANCM, from egg extracts inhibits xFANCD2-Ub formation in response to plasmid DNA (16Sobeck A. Stone S. Hoatlin M.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 4283-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 5A). However, examination of a time course following the addition of plasmid DNA to egg extracts (Fig. 2A) revealed that monoubiquitination of xFANCD2 occurred prior to phosphorylation of xFANCM. Based on this result, we hypothesized that xFANCD2 might also act upstream of FANCM. To test this, we depleted egg extracts of xFANCD2 and tested whether the plasmid DNA-induced xFANCM-PPP formation was affected in the absence of xFANCD2. Interestingly, xFANCM-PPP formation was partially impaired in xFANCD2-depleted extracts compared with mock-depleted extracts (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the effect of xFANCD2 depletion on xFANCM-PPP is directly due to the absence of xFANCD2 and not another protein that might be co-depleted with xFANCD2, we added recombinant wild-type xFANCD2 to extracts depleted of endogenous xFANCD2. As shown in Fig. 3B, recombinant xFANCD2 completely restored the plasmid-triggered FANCM-PPP formation in xFANCD2-depleted extracts, indicating that xFANCM phosphorylation is indeed partly controlled by xFANCD2. The facts that xFANCD2 has partial control over xFANCM phosphorylation and that xFANCM is phosphorylated when bound to replicating chromatin (Fig. 1D) suggested that xFANCD2 might be involved in stabilizing xFANCM on chromatin. To test this idea, we analyzed chromatin binding of xFANCM in xFANCD2-depleted extracts. As shown in Fig. 3C, levels of chromatin-bound xFANCM were reduced in xFANCD2-depleted extracts compared with mock-depleted extracts during replication and on post-replication chromatin. Our results suggest that FANCD2, the proposed downstream target of the FA core complex, is able to signal to the upstream core complex by partially regulating phosphorylation and chromatin association of FANCM.FIGURE 3Chromatin binding and DNA-induced phosphorylation of xFANCM is partially dependent on xFANCD2. A, formation of xFANCM-PPP in response to plasmid DNA is partially controlled by xFANCD2. Egg extracts were either mock-depleted (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or depleted of xFANCD2 (lanes 2, 4, and 6) and incubated with plasmid DNA for 60 min. To further stabilize phosphorylated isoforms of xFANCM, extracts were supplemented with tautomycin (lanes 3 and 4). Following incubation of plasmid DNA, 1 μl of extract was subsequently analyzed for xFANCM and xFANCD2 by immunoblotting. B, recombinant xFANCD2 rescues xFANCM phosphorylation deficiency in xFANCD2-depleted extracts. Extracts were either mock-depleted (lanes 1 and 4) or depleted of xFANCD2 (lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6). xFANCD2-depleted extracts were either nonsupplemented (lanes 2 and 5) or supplemented with recombinant, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged xFANCD2 (lanes 3 and 6). Extracts were either left DNA-free (lanes 1–3) or incubated with plasmid DNA (lanes 4–6) for 30 min, and 1 μl of extract was analyzed for xFANCD2 and xFANCM by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. C, chromatin binding of xFANCM is partially controlled by xFANCD2. Sperm chromatin was added to S phase extracts that were either mock-depleted (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or depleted of xFANCD2 (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) and incubated for the indicated time points. Following incubation, chromatin fractions were reisolated and analyzed for xFANCD2 and xFANCM by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot.

Skeletal muscle differentiation is a highly orchestrated phenomenon. The transition from cycling myoblasts to mature myofibers is dependent on a coordinated response involving up-regulation of muscle-specific transcription factors, engagement of a defined gene expression program, followed by an ordered assembly of muscle structural proteins to form the basic contractile units known as sarcomeres. The key molecular genetic features of this skeletal muscle differentiation program are well understood (1Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Clin. Genet. 2000; 57: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 2Buckingham M. Bajard L. Chang T. Daubas P. Hadchouel J. Meilhac S. Montarras D. Rocancourt D. Relaix F. J.

Nevertheless, the regulatory networks that control and integrate sarcomeric assembly in developing myofibers remain comparatively unknown. The sarcomere is composed of thick myosin and thin actin myofilaments together with the giant sarcomeric proteins titin and nebulin. The actin and myosin filaments are anchored at the Z-line and M-line, respectively. Titin has been coined a “molecular ruler” of the thick filament because it mediates an ordered and repetitive series of interactions with myosin and with several proteins at the Z- and M-lines that include the sarcomeric protein complex (4Au Y. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 3016-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Lange S. Ehler E. Gautel M. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Similarly, nebulin has also been coined the molecular ruler of the thin filament for its ordered assembly of actin (6Labeit S. Gibson T. Lakey A. Leonard K. Zeviani M. Knight P. Wardale J. Trinick J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 7McElhinny A.S. Schwach C. Valichnac M. Mount-Patrick S. Gregorio C.C. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and recent evidence indicates that nebulin also mediates protein interactions of the sarcomere (reviewed in Refs. 4Au Y. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 3016-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Sinz A. Wang K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7903-7913Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The large number of protein interactions that initiate and establish the mature sarcomere implies that one or more protein structural motifs may be critical to the assembly process. Surprisingly, many of these proteins contain Src homology 3 domains (SH3), 3The abbreviations used are: SH3Src homology 3HAhemagglutinindpcdays post-coitumGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMS/MStandem mass spectrometryLCliquid chromatographyPIpropidium iodide. a well characterized protein-protein interaction domain (reviewed in Refs. 9Kaneko T.

Titin contains numerous SH3 domains, many of which affect its function. Similarly, nebulin function and incorporation into the mature sarcomere appear to be dependent on an endogenous SH3 domain (4Au Y. Cell. Mol.

Titin-associated proteins such as obscurin have SH3 motifs that appear to modulate the G-protein-coupled signal transduction pathways. Notably, a stretch of prolines representative of an SH3 binding region resides within the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain of obscurin (14Young P. Ehler E. Gautel M. J.

These observations suggest that SH3 adaptor protein(s) play a pivotal role in the construction and stabilization of the sarcomere. Src homology 3 hemagglutinin days post-coitum green fluorescent protein tandem mass spectrometry liquid chromatography propidium iodide. Once assembled, the sarcomere must be stabilized with other structures in the developing myofiber. Paramount among these components is the sarcolemma/t-tubule system. The sarcolemma is a highly specialized membrane with numerous involutions (t-tubules) that couple the external signal for contraction to the basic contractile unit, the sarcomere. As such, it is reasonable to hypothesize that sarcomere assembly and sarcolemmal biogenesis may be facilitated by an overlapping set of proteins. However, invoking such a model will be dependent on the identification of a modular protein that utilizes distinct domains to influence each of these disparate activities. Within this context, one candidate factor that has emerged is the tumor suppressor protein Bin1 (bridging integrator protein 1). Bin1 was initially characterized as a c-Myc interacting protein, capable of repressing c-Myc transcriptional activation (16Sakamuro D. Elliott K.J. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 17Elliott K. Sakamuro D. Basu A. Du W. Wunner W. Staller P. Gaubatz S. Zhang H. Prochownik E. Eilers M. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3564-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Bin1 retains distinct modular features that include a mid-body c-Myc binding domain, a C-terminal SH3 domain with unique structural features not shared with SH3 regions of sequence-related proteins, and an N-terminal domain (referred to as the BAR domain) with sequence similarity to a larger family of synaptic vesicle/clathrin-interacting factors, exemplified by the neuron-enriched protein amphiphysin (18Wechsler-Reya R.

Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 37-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Bin1 has been implicated in regulating striated muscle function across a variety of model systems. Overexpression of Bin1 in a myoblast cell line inhibits cell growth and results in a more rapid onset of differentiation following growth factor withdrawal (21Wechsler-Reya R.J. Elliott K.J. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Generation of mice with a null mutation in bin1 leads to a severe disruption in cardiomyocyte function through an undetermined mechanism (22Muller A.J. Baker J.F. DuHadaway J.B. Ge K. Farmer G. Donover P.S. Meade R. Reid C. Grzanna R. Roach A.H. Shah N. Soler A.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4295-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Null mutations of the Drosophila bin1 homologue have revealed that Bin1 is required for maintenance of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle (23Razzaq A. Robinson I.M. McMahon H.T.

Development. 2001; 128: 5005-5015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of the contractile response was attributed to an ability of the Bin1 BAR domain to enhance sarcolemmal membrane curvature, influencing t-tubule assembly and maturation (25Lee E. Marcucci M. Daniell L. Pypaert M. Weisz O.A. Ochoa G.C. Farsad K. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Science. 2002; 297: 1193-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study has demonstrated that patients suffering from centronuclear myopathy have homozygous mutations in bin, at the regions encoding either the BAR or SH3 domain (26Nicot A.S. Toussaint A. Tosch V. Kretz C. Wallgren-Pettersson C. Iwarsson E. Kingston H. Garnier J.M. Biancalana V. Oldfors A. Mandel J.L. Laporte J. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1134-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). A representative tissue culture model of the individual BAR domain or SH3 domain mutations displayed obvious defects in membrane tubulation events. This myopathy also displayed a phenotype consistent with sarcomere disorder, yet the significance of the Bin1 BAR and SH3 domains was not tested in this regard. Here we explored the hypothesis that distinct modular domains of Bin1 separately influence the key events associated with skeletal muscle differentiation. Specifically, we propose that the Bin1 SH3 domain is a sarcomere-organizing protein. We demonstrate that transgenic overexpression of the Bin1 SH3 domain results in a profound perturbation of skeletal muscle ultrastructure, characterized by increased myofiber size with sarcomeric disorganization. This phenotypic outcome derives in part from a disruption in the endogenous interaction between the Bin1 SH3 domain and a number of contractile proteins, including sarcomeric actin and myosin. The sarcomere disruption in this model is also influenced by a loss in the endogenous interaction between the Bin1 SH3 domain and Cdk5, a pro-myogenic kinase that promotes sarcomeric assembly in part by phosphorylating a serine-responsive region of titin. Collectively, these observations suggest that Bin1 is a crucial adaptor protein that acts to promote skeletal muscle differentiation through domain-specific assembly of the mature sarcomere. The SH3 region (encoding amino acids 361–434) of the murine bin1 gene (gene identifier) was produced through PCR amplification. To direct systemic expression of the Bin1 SH3 construct, the sequence-verified PCR product was cloned in-frame into the pCAGGS expression vector containing a modified cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter with a rabbit β-globin poly(A) (27Niwa H.

Delvoye N. Ellis J. Wall L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3713-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A total of 12 founder lines were generated, of which 5 were subject to further characterization. Tissues were removed and fixed in 10% formalin for 4–5 days (skeletal muscle, heart, mammary gland, prostate, skin, liver, lung, brain). Fixed tissues were then embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 10 μm, stained, and counter-stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Muscle fiber diameters were assessed on hindlimb muscle groups from multiple founder lines, with a minimum of four individual muscles measured per group. Ultrastructure examination of wild type and bin1SH3 gastrocnemius was performed as described previously (30Franzini-Armstrong C. Dev. Biol. 1991; 146: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Longitudinal semi-thin (0.3–0.5 μm) sections were used to visualize the muscle ultrastructure under an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Embryos were collected between 8.5 and 12.5 days post-coitum (dpc) and prepared as described previously (31Sassoon D. Lyons G. Wright W.E. Lin V. Lassar A. Weintraub H. Buckingham M. Nature. 1989; 341: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) A 5′-portion of the murine bin1 cDNA was used as a probe for whole mount in situ hybridizations. In situ detection of the pCAGGS transgene was performed with a riboprobe generated against the full-length rabbit β-globin poly(A) region. The myogenin riboprobe used was as described previously (32Wilkinson D.G. Nieto M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were generated as per the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). For in situ hybridization, murine embryos were treated as described (31Sassoon D. Lyons G. Wright W.E. Lin V. Lassar A. Weintraub H. Buckingham M. Nature. 1989; 341: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Skeletal myoblast c2c12 cells were cultured as described previously (33Fernando P. Kelly J.F. Balazsi K. Slack R.S. Megeney L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11025-11030Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). All reagents for c2c12 culture were obtained from Invitrogen. Primary myoblast cell lines (muscle satellite cells) were isolated as described previously (33Fernando P. Kelly J.F. Balazsi K. Slack R.S. Megeney L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11025-11030Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization of skeletal muscle differentiation markers in cultured cells was performed as described previously (33Fernando P. Kelly J.F. Balazsi K. Slack R.S. Megeney L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11025-11030Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-myosin heavy chain MF20 hybridoma and visualized by counterstaining with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Adenoviral expression vectors were generated using the AdEasy adenoviral vector system (Stratagene). The AdHA-SH3-hrGFP-2 construct was generated using the bin1 SH3 region (exons 15 and 16). The KSP region of titin (cDNA gift from Siegfried Labeit, Mannheim, Germany) was used to generate the AdHA-TiKSP-GFP. Annexin-V-propidium iodide (PI) analyses of apoptotic and necrotic cells were performed using the annexin-V-FLUOS staining kit (Roche Applied Science) on a Beckman-Coulter ALTRA flow cytometer. Cell growth assays were evaluated in both cycling cells and in cells after 2 days in low serum media (differentiation media) using a 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine cell proliferation assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Myoblast fusion was evaluated by determining the number of myosin heavy chain-positive myotubes containing two or more nuclei relative to the total number of myosin heavy chain-positive myotubes. Cell and tissue protein lysates were prepared in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (33Fernando P. Kelly J.F. Balazsi K. Slack R.S. Megeney L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11025-11030Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Immunoblots assays were performed as described previously (33Fernando P. Kelly J.F. Balazsi K. Slack R.S. Megeney L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11025-11030Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) using antibodies against myogenin, p38, MEF2C, skeletal α-actin and myosin, Cdk5, and Bin199D (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), myosin heavy chain MF20 hybridoma, and M-cadherin and HA tag (Sigma). Lysates from c2c12 cultured cells were prepared as above, and 800–1000 μg of total cell lysate was loaded onto an equilibrated Superose 6HR 10/30 column. Samples were run in 0.05 m phosphate buffer with 0.15 m NaCl using an ÄKTA 10 Explorer FPLC. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (33Fernando P. Kelly J.F. Balazsi K. Slack R.S. Megeney L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11025-11030Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). GST-pulldown assays were performed using recombinant GST and GST-SH3 purified on glutathione beads with 150 μg of total protein from tissue culture lysates. Protein kinase analyses were performed as described previously (33Fernando P. Kelly J.F. Balazsi K. Slack R.S. Megeney L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11025-11030Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). A two-dimensional nano-liquid chromatography MS/MS approach was used to identify Bin1 SH3-interacting proteins. Following GST pulldown assays, the tagged protein complexes were subjected to on-bead tryptic digests, and peptides were bound to a cation exchange column on a CapLC capillary LC system (Waters). Peptides were eluted with a gradient ammonium acetate solution (2, 5, 10, 25, 50 100, and 200 mm) and separated through a C18 reverse phase column followed by electrospray ionization and quadrupole/time-of-flight MS/MS on a Q-TOF Ultima hybrid mass spectrometer. Peptide MS/MS spectra were searched against the NCBInr data base using the MASCOT searching algorithm. The modular domain structure of Bin1 indicated that this protein may serve as an ideal adaptor protein for the assembly and maintenance of the mature myofiber. However, the post-natal distribution of Bin1 has been reported to be ubiquitous with an enriched expression pattern in neural and cardiac tissues and in adult skeletal muscle (16Sakamuro D. Elliott K.J. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 18Wechsler-Reya R. Sakamuro D. Zhang J. Duhadaway J. Prendergast G.C. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Therefore, to address the function of Bin1 in skeletal muscle as a probable maturation regulatory factor, we examined its distribution during murine embryogenesis using an antisense riboprobe specific to the murine bin1 cDNA (16Sakamuro D. Elliott K.J. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). bin1 expression was not detectable in developing embryos prior to 8.5 dpc. By 10–10.5 dpc, bin1 transcripts were readily visible within the branchial arches, somites, and the ependymal region of the developing forebrain and hindbrain (Fig. 1, A–D). Somites represent the tissue reservoirs from which most skeletal muscle is derived. The myogenic stem cells originating from the somites provide the myoblast pool from which all trunk and limb musculature arises, whereas the branchial arch myoblasts contribute to components of head musculature (35Buckingham M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Histological sections of embryos at 10.5 dpc confirmed that bin1 expression was concentrated in the differentiated regions of the somite (myotome portion) and ependymal layers of the developing brain (Fig. 1, C and D). In addition, embryos revealed elevated bin1 expression in both the epicardial region of ventricular trabeculae and within the developing optic cup (data not shown), although the predominant expression appeared to be within the skeletal muscle primordia. At later stages of embryogenesis (12.5 dpc), the expression of bin1 remained elevated within tissues of the skeletal muscle lineage, including the developing pre-muscle masses of the limbs, head, and scapular regions (Fig. 1E). However, closer examination of these embryos revealed a divergence in the skeletal muscle expression pattern of bin1 in that the highest expression was found in regions where differentiation had recently initiated such as in limb and scapular muscle groups (Fig. 1, E and F). Conversely, bin1 expression declined in areas of more established muscle development, such as the primordia of body wall muscle at 12.5 dpc (Fig. 1F). The enriched expression of bin1 in regions specific to skeletal muscle development suggested a site-specific function for this protein. Interestingly, accumulation of differentially spliced bin1 variants in neural, cardiac, testicular, and other tissues may also suggest site-specific functions of bin1 (reviewed in Ref. 20Ren G. Vajjhala P. Lee J.S. Winsor B. Munn A.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 37-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Indeed, other members of the BAR domain family have been assigned a variety of cellular functions, including transcription, apoptosis, endocytosis, tumor suppression, and cell growth control (reviewed in Ref. 20Ren G. Vajjhala P. Lee J.S. Winsor B. Munn A.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 37-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Conceivably, such divergent roles for Bin1 may be explained by invoking a model whereby separable domains of the Bin1 protein manage domain-specific cellular activities. Therefore, to directly test this hypothesis, we created a transgenic strain that overexpressed the SH3 domain of Bin1. The SH3 domain remains the most conserved feature of all the Bin1 splice variants (36Owen D.J. Wigge P. Vallis Y. Moore J.D. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5273-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Bin1 SH3 domain appears to be structurally unique across a wide variety of SH3 motifs suggesting a distinct or limited function for this region of the Bin1 protein (19Kojima C. Hashimoto A. Yabuta I. Hirose M. Hashimoto S. Kanaho Y. Sumimoto H. Ikegami T. Sabe H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4413-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36Owen D.J. Wigge P. Vallis Y. Moore J.D.

Szyperski T. Penn L.Z. Arrowsmith C.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As such, we anticipated that the overexpression of this domain would disrupt endogenous Bin1 interactions and thereby impair Bin1 function with little to no effect on other SH3-containing proteins. We utilized a ubiquitously expressed transgene (pCAGGS expression vector) as a targeted delivery system for overexpression of the Bin1 SH3 domain (27Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4616) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The enhancer promoter combination of this transgene has frequently demonstrated a global expression pattern in transgenic mice (28Lobe C.G. Koop K.E. Kreppner W. Lomeli H. Gertsenstein M. Nagy A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Importantly, the use of a ubiquitous promoter allowed us to address whether the SH3 domain of Bin1 performed tissue-specific functions or whether this region of the Bin1 protein conveyed non-muscle cellular functions, in addition to the anticipated role in skeletal muscle. We performed numerous rounds of pronuclear injections to collect and analyze founder embryos (transient transgenics) that might display profound changes in vivo and create founder lines for breeding to homozygosity. As expected, a ubiquitous expression of Bin1 SH3 gene product was detected in embryos at 10.5 days with a riboprobe designed against the β-globin poly(A) sequence from the pCAGGS targeting construct (Fig. 2B). Transgenic mice expressing the SH3 region (bin1SH3) were characteristically smaller than littermate controls (Fig. 2C). Despite the ubiquitous expression of bin1SH3 in young pups, we observed an enriched accumulation of the Bin1 SH3 transgene in both the heart and skeletal muscles of adult mice. The pronounced expression of the SH3 domain in skeletal muscle may indicate a bias for expression of the transgene/enhancer combination in this tissue type. Nevertheless, robust expression was noted in several other cell types. To investigate putative pathological effects caused by the overexpression of the Bin1 SH3 domain, we performed an extensive histologic examination of the Bin1 SH3 gene product in mice. The loss of Bin1 function has been associated with malignant transformation in a variety of tissues and cells (38Tajiri T. Liu X. Thompson P.M. Tanaka S. Suita S. Zhao H. Maris J.M. Prendergast G.C.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting that altered expression of the Bin1 SH3 domain may result in pleitrophic pathology. We inspected the progeny of five independent bin1SH3 transgenic lines (>200 mice) during the natural lifespan of these animals. Overt tumor formation was never observed in any progeny even up to 1 year of age. Moreover, with the exception of skeletal muscle, histologic inspection of target organs in aged mice showed normal cellular architecture with no evidence of hyperplasia despite the robust expression of bin1SH3 (Fig. 3A). For example, sections of heart, lung, liver, prostate, and skin revealed no overt alteration in cellular architecture or in gross morphology (Fig. 3A). As noted above, the absence of pathology in these tissues is in contrast to studies demonstrating tumor formation with bin1 disruption. Bin1 and its homologue in yeast have also been implicated as integral signal components in apoptotic programs (38Tajiri T. Liu X. Thompson P.M. Tanaka S. Suita S. Zhao H. Maris J.M. Prendergast G.C.

https://openalex.org/W2028031041,"Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) is a complex retrovirus that encodes at least three regulatory and accessory proteins, including Rem. Rem is required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA and efficient expression of viral proteins. Our previous data indicated that sequences at the envelope-3' long terminal repeat junction are required for proper export of viral RNA. To further map the Rem-responsive element (RmRE), reporter vectors containing various portions of the viral envelope gene and the 3' long terminal repeat were tested in the presence and absence of Rem in transient transfection assays. A 476-bp fragment that spans the envelope-long terminal repeat junction had activity equivalent to the entire 3'-end of the mouse mammary tumor virus genome, but further deletions at the 5'- or 3'-ends reduced Rem responsiveness. RNase structure mapping of the full-length RmRE and a 3'-truncation suggested multiple domains with local base pairing and intervening single-stranded segments. A secondary structure model constrained by these data is reminiscent of the RNA response elements of other complex retroviruses, with numerous local stem-loops and long-range base pairs near the 5'- and 3'-boundaries, and differs substantially from an earlier model generated without experimental constraints. Covariation analysis provides limited support for basic features of our model. Reporter assays in human and mouse cell lines revealed similar boundaries, suggesting that the RmRE does not require cell type-specific proteins to form a functional structure."

We find that human BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells possess a signaling cascade initiated by Ca2+ influx via voltage-dependent calcium channels and the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and culminating in nuclear calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV)-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factors Ca2+/cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) and ATF1 (activating transcription factor-1). This pathway functions to maintain BE(2)C cells in an undifferentiated, proliferative state. Parallel to this Ca2+-dependent pathway is a hormone-responsive program by which retinoic acid (RA) initiates the differentiation of BE(2)C cells toward a neuronal lineage. This is evidenced by RA-dependent induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p21/Cip1 (Cdk-interacting protein 1) and cell cycle arrest, induction of the neuroblastic marker doublecortin and of the neuron-specific intermediate filament protein, peripherin, and by RA-stimulated extension of neuritic processes. During neuronal differentiation there is a complex antagonistic interplay between these two major signaling pathways. RA down-regulates expression of CaMKIV and one of its upstream activators, CaMKK1 (calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 1). This is accompanied by RA-induced suppression of activating phosphorylation of CREB with a time course paralleling that of CaMKIV down-regulation. RA-induced repression of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase/CaMKIV/CREB pathway appears to be involved in regulating the timing of neuronal differentiation, as shown by the effect of RNA interference of CaMKIV to markedly accelerate RA-dependent up-regulation of p21/Cip1 and doublecortin expression and RA-promoted neurite outgrowth.

The downstream targets of CaMKIV are thought to be primarily nuclear due to its sequestration in the cytoplasm at resting intracellular Ca2+ levels by binding to Ser/Thr protein phosphatase type 2A, which maintains CaMKIV in a dephosphorylated and inactive state (21Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).

In multiple cell types, including T-cells and neurons, intracellular Ca2+ elevation provokes CREB phosphorylation at its transcriptionally activating site, Ser-133, by CaMKIV (30Bito H. Deisseroth K.

In addition to CaMKIV, protein kinase A and downstream kinases in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (ribosomal S6 kinase and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase) can also effect CREB phosphorylation as a result of intracellular Ca2+-elevating stimuli. In depolarized neurons, CaMKIV is reported to mediate more rapid and transient phosphorylation of CREB than does activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (32Wu G.Y. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 2808-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). However, for the most part, the roles and kinetics of the various CREB kinases in intracellular Ca2+-dependent CREB phosphorylation and transcriptional activation are undefined (recently reviewed in Refs. 12Wayman G.A.

Biochem. 2007; 45: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). CaMKIV expression appears to be regulated during embryonic development. In some cell types, its expression correlates with distinct periods of cellular proliferation, differentiation, or survival (34Wang S.L. Ribar T.J. Means A.R. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 351-361PubMed Google Scholar). Consonant with potential developmental roles, CaMKIV is found in different types of multipotent stem and progenitor cells, including immature neutrophils, embryonic stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and osteoclast progenitors (35Lawson N.D.

The research described herein was conducted to explore the role of the CaMKIV signaling pathway in the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of multipotent neural cells. As a cellular model, we utilized human BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells. BE(2)C cells phenotypically resemble malignantly transformed NSCs, having the capacity for both self-renewal and multipotency. BE(2)C cells differentiate to a substrate-adherent/glial phenotype with long term bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) treatment or to a neuroblastic phenotype when cultured with the vitamin A derivative, all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) (42Ross R.A.

We report here that RA represses the CaMKIV cascade during its induction of neuronal differentiation, an event that may be important for temporal coordination of the transition from neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation to a neuronally differentiated state. The following reagents were obtained from Sigma: STO-609 (7H-benzimidazo[2,1-a]benz[de]isoquinoline-7-one-3-carboxylic acid), RA, NMDA, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), tri-iodothyronine (thyroid hormone), BrdUrd, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and forskolin. Insulin-like growth factor 1 was obtained from BIOSOURCE. All other reagents were obtained from standard sources and were of the highest grade available. Human BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells were obtained from ATCC. Cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1 ratio) and containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Foundation, Gemini Bio-products), 1.0 mm non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), and, unless otherwise indicated, 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and maintained in a 5% CO2, 95% air humidified incubator at 37 °C. For routine culturing, cells were passaged once every 7 days, and complete medium was replaced 4 days later. The following plasmids were used: pcDNA 3.1-EGFP (a gift of M. K. Stachowiak), Ca2+/cAMP-response element (CRE)-firefly luciferase reporter (CRE-Luc; Stratagene), SV40-Renilla luciferase (pRL; Promega), and constitutively active CaMKIV (CA-CaMKIV; a gift of G. A. Wayman and T. R. Soderling). The following siRNA duplexes (Ambion) were used: CaMKIV siRNA targeting exon 11 (CaMKIVsi-11), CaMKIV siRNA targeting exon 1 (CaMKIVsi-1), and negative control siRNA 1 (NSsi). BE(2)C cells were plated at an appropriate density in antibiotic-free complete medium 24 h prior to transfection. Plasmids or siRNA duplexes were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 as the transfection agent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After a 5–6-h incubation period in serum-free OPTIMEM I, transfection components were removed and replaced with complete medium lacking antibiotics. CRE-Luc, pRL, and, where indicated, CA-CaMKIV were transfected into BE(2)C cells plated on 100-mm plates at concentrations of 150, 3.48, and 300 ng/ml, respectively. After 48 h, the dual luciferase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Subcellular fractionation of BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells growing in monolayer culture was performed with the ProteoextractTM subcellular proteome extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). Nuclear and cytosolic compartments were subjected to immunoblotting for their respective markers, histone H3 and lactate dehydrogenase, to assess the effectiveness of the fractionation procedure. BE(2)C cells were lysed in harvest buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2% SDS, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 25 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, 100 μm okadaic acid, 5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm EDTA) and chilled on ice for 10 min, and lysate and cellular debris were removed with a rubber policeman. Cell lysate was sonicated on ice to shear DNA to reduce viscosity. Cellular debris was then pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and supernatant was transferred to a fresh prechilled tube. Equal protein amounts were subjected to standard electrophoresis conditions on 7.5, 10, or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were rinsed in TBST (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20) twice, for 5 min each time, at room temperature and incubated in blocking buffer (5% (w/v) nonfat milk or 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST) for 18 h at 4 °C or 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were rinsed three times for 5 min each time in TBST and then incubated for 18 h at 4 °C or for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer containing the following primary antibodies at their respective dilutions: p21/Cip1 (1:500; Cell Signaling), pan-CREB (1:5,000; Cell Signaling), phosphoserine 133 CREB (1:1,000; Cell Signaling), CaMKIV (1:3,000 (Cell Signaling) or 1:1,000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA)), GAPDH (1:10,000–20,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Bcl-2 (1:500–1,000; Cell Signaling), poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) (1:500–1:5,000; Cell Signaling), pro-caspase-3 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling), DCX (1:500–1,000; Cell Signaling), lactate dehydrogenase (1:500; U.S. Biologicals), histone H3 (1:10,000; AbCam), or vimentin (1:1,000; BD Biosciences). Following three 5-min washes in TBST, blots were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 h and then subjected to four 15-min washes in TBST. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL. BE(2)C cells were plated on coverslips in wells of a 12-well plate at a density of ∼104 cells/coverslip, 24 h prior to drug treatments or transfections and then labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 1–3 h, as indicated in the figure legends (Fig. 3, Table 1). Following treatment, cells were fixed with 1 ml of fixation solution (8% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.2, and containing 300 mm sucrose) at 37 °C, which was replaced with fixation solution but containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were rinsed three times in PBS, pH 7.2, and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. They were then rinsed three times with PBS and incubated in 2 n HCl at 37 °C for 15 min in PBS to denature chromatin. Cells were rinsed five times with PBS, pH 10.0, followed by three rinses with PBS, pH 7.2, and then incubated in PBS containing 2% goat serum for 18 h at 4 °C to block nonspecific binding. Following three 5-min washes, cells were incubated with PBS, 2% goat serum containing BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at a 1:1000 dilution for 18 h at 4 °C. Goat anti-mouse Alexa 587 (Molecular Probes) in PBS, 2% goat serum was used at a 1:2,000 dilution to detect BrdUrd labeling.TABLE 1RNAi of CaMKIV induces cell cycle arrestBrdUrd+/GFP+BrdUrd−/GFP+CaMKIVsi-1124538NSsi102725 Open table in a new tab For detection of neuronal microtubules, coverslips were incubated with βIII tubulin antibody (Sigma) at a 1:1000 dilution for 18 h at 4 °C. Goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes) was then used at a 1:1,000 dilution in PBS, 2% goat serum. After 18 h of incubation, coverslips were incubated with 300 nm DAPI for 5 min (where indicated), rinsed three times in PBS and then H2O, and mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Images were captured with a Zeiss Axioimager Z1 Axiophot wide field fluorescence microscope and analyzed using the program Image J. BE(2)C cells were lysed, and total RNA was isolated using Qiashredder columns and RNeasy kits, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was removed by on column DNase digestion during RNA isolation with an RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). RNA was quantified, and purity was assessed spectrophotometrically. cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III reverse transcriptase and other reagents as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Briefly, RNA (2.12 μg) was combined with 30 ng of random hexamers and 0.4 mm dNTPs, heated at 65 °C for 5 min, and rapidly chilled on ice for 5 min. First strand buffer, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, RNase out, and Superscript III reverse transcriptase were added. Samples were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, 50 °C for 60 min, and 70 °C for 15 min, at which point the reaction was stopped by holding at 4 °C. RNase H was added to each tube, and remaining RNA was digested at 37 °C for 20 min. End point (non-quantitative) PCR was performed using Platinum Taq polymerase under standard reaction conditions as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen) with BE(2)C cell cDNA (2 μg) and 0.2 μm forward and 0.2 μm reverse primers. PCR was performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences or Bio-Rad thermocycler. Thermocycling parameters were as follows: 10 min at 95 °C, 30–35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58–60 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s, followed by 10 min at 72 °C. mRNA was quantified by real time qRT-PCR of BE(2)C cDNA with SYBR Green detection (Bio-Rad) using a Bio-Rad iCycler. Thermocycling parameters were as follows: 2 min at 95 °C and 45 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The amplification specificity was verified by melt curve analysis. The average starting quantity for each condition was calculated by the standard curve method using GAPDH as normalizer. Primers were designed using the program PRIME (Genetics Computer Group). Specificity of the primers was established by a preliminary end point PCR (in the presence and absence of reverse transcriptase) and melt curve analysis following qRT-PCR. In most cases, primers spanned at least one exon/intron junction. Primers are listed by target cDNA, forward primer (5′ to 3′), and reverse primer (5′ to 3′), respectively: Bcl-2, GCCGTTGGCCCCCGTTGCTTTTC and CGCCCACATCTCCCGCATCCCAC; CaMKIV, TGCAACTCCAGCCCCAGATGCAC and ACAGACCACATGTCCACCTCAGGTCC; CaMKK1, GCAACCAGTTTGAGGGGAACGACGC and CAACGTGACGCCAGTGGCCCATAC; CaMKK2, CCAGACCAGCCCGACATAGCTGAGGA and CGTGACCCAGGGGTGCAGCTTGATT; DCX, CGTTTCTACCGCAATGGGGACCGC and ACGCACTCCCTGAGGCAGGTTGATG; GAPDH, TGGCATTGCCCTCAACGACCACTTTG and TCCTCTTGTGCTCTTGCTGGGGCT; p21/Cip1, CGAAAACGGCGGCAGACCAGCATGA and TGAGGCCCTCGCGCTTCCAGGAC; Peripherin, GGAGGAGCTGCGACAGCTAAAAGAGG and AGGAGGCAAAAGAATGGACGGGCAC. In neurons, CaMKIV is localized primarily to the nucleus (13Jensen K.F. Ohmstede C.A. Fisher R.S. Sahyoun N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 2850-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In experiments using T-lymphocytes and embryonic kidney 293 cells, a proportion of the enzyme was shown to be cytoplasmic due to interaction with Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2A (21Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Moreover, the CaMKIV-Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2A interaction is disrupted by Ca2+/CaM, suggesting that the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of CaMKIV is responsive to variations over time in the level of intracellular Ca2+ (45Anderson K.A. Noeldner P.K. Reece K. Wadzinski B.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31708-31716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed the subcellular distribution of CaMKIV in BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells without the addition of an intracellular Ca2+-elevating agonist using a selective extraction/differential centrifugation method. As shown in Fig. 1A, CaMKIV was almost exclusively recovered in the nuclear fraction. This suggests that either the localization of CaMKIV to the nuclear compartment in BE(2)C cells does not require elevation of intracellular Ca2+ or that intracellular Ca2+ is elevated to a sufficient extent under basal conditions to maintain nuclear retention of CaMKIV. The nuclear transcription factor CREB is the most thoroughly documented in vivo target of CaMKIV (24Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A.

The above reports would suggest that deregulated TBX2 levels have detrimental consequences to normal cellular function, and it is therefore critical to understand the mechanism(s) regulating TBX2 gene expression. However, while several pathways, including BMP, Shh, and stress signaling, have been associated with the regulation of TBX2 gene expression, the details of this regulation remain unknown (14Abrahams A.

The PKC family comprises at least 12 isoforms that are divided into three subfamilies: conventional or classical PKCs (cPKCs; α, β ½, and γ), novel PKCs (nPKCs; δ, ϵ, η, and θ), and atypical PKCs (aPKCs; ζ and λ/ι). PKC is a major intracellular target of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and it is well established that in response to TPA, PKCs can activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK MAPK pathway. There is also accumulating evidence suggesting that TPA can activate p38 and JNK in a cell type-dependent manner (17López-Bergami P. Habelhah H. Bhoumik A. Zhang W. Wang L.H. Ronai Z. Mol.

The nucleosome is the basic building unit of chromatin and consists of a protein core of a histone octamer (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) with 146 base pairs of DNA wound around it. N-terminal tails of histones protrude outside of the nucleosome and are thus readily subject to a variety of covalent modifications such as acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and ADP-ribosylation. These modifications have been proposed to cause an alteration of chromatin configuration and/or form a recognition motif allowing access of relevant proteins of transcription to regulate gene expression (19Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 20Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7666) Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation of histone H3 has been associated with transcriptional activation of c-jun and c-fos immediate-early (IE) response genes in response to growth factors and phorbol esters (21Mahadevan L.C. Willis A.C. Barratt M.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The list of genes identified that are associated with stimulus-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 is growing (22Clayton A.L. Mahadevan L.C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that TPA induces TBX2 gene expression in normal human lung fibroblasts in a PKC-dependent and MAPK-independent manner. Our data further reveal that TPA-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 plays a critical role in regulating TBX2 gene expression. Moreover, we provide evidence to link PKC to the activation of the mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1), which we show to be responsible for the TPA-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 seen in this study. WI-38 (ATCC CCL-75) normal human embryonic lung fibroblasts, their in vitro transformed counterparts WI-38 CT-1 (23Namba M. Nishitani K. Kimoto T. Gann. 1980; 71: 300-307PubMed Google Scholar) and SVWI-38 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's-modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For TPA treatment, we used 100 nm TPA (Sigma). The PKC inhibitor GF109203 (20 μm), MEK-1 inhibitor PD98095 (25 μm), p38 inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm), and JNK inhibitor SP600125 (20 μm) (Calbiochem) were added 1 h prior to treatment with TPA. The human TBX2 promoter luciferase reporter construct was generated by inserting the SacI(-1606)-HindIII(+32) fragment of the human TBX2 gene into the appropriately cleaved luciferase reporter vector pGL3-basic (Promega). The pRL-TK vector (Promega) was used as an internal control reporter to test for transfection efficiency. The 4xAP-1-luc construct, pCMV-c-Jun and pCMV-JunB expression vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Birrer (National Institutes of Health). Cells were plated at 1.5 × 105 cells/ml in 6-well plates 1 day before transfection. Non-liposomal-mediated gene transfer was performed using FuGENE®6 (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer's instructions using 1 μg of DNA consisting of the reporter construct, expression vectors, and the internal control vector. Thirty hours after transfection, cells were analyzed for luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay (Promega) following manufacturer's instructions and quantified with a Luminoskan Ascent Luminometer (Thermo LabSystems). Suppression of MSK1 cellular expression was achieved using siRNA that specifically targets MSK1 mRNA. WI-38 cells were transfected with 5 μm anti-MSK1 siRNA or control (non-silencing) siRNA (Qiagen) for 72 h, using HiPerfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were treated with TPA 8 h prior to harvesting protein for Western blotting. Western blot assays were carried out as described previously (24Teng H. Davis E. Abrahams A. Mowla S. Parker M.I. Prince S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 618-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on 8–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, as required and transferred to Hybond ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were probed with appropriate primary antibodies and detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (1:5000) and visualized by ECL (Pierce). The primary antibodies used were: mouse monoclonal anti-Tbx2 62-2 antibody (1:2000), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-H3 (1:2000, Upstate Biotechnology), anti-phospho-p38 (1:1000), anti-p38 (1:5000), anti-phospho- MSK1 (1:1000), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (1:1000), anti-phospho-JNK (1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA), goat polyclonal anti-MSK1 (1:1000), rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Jun, JunB, ERK2, Sp1 (1:500), and mouse monoclonal α-tubulin (1:500) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Densitometric analysis of Western blots was done with a Syngene scanner and GeneTool and GeneSnap software (Syngene). Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells and quantitative RT-PCR assays were carried out using the LightCycler as previously described (24Teng H. Davis E. Abrahams A. Mowla S. Parker M.I. Prince S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 618-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Primers used for RT-PCR were human TBX2: (forward) 5′-ATGGGCATGGGTCACCTACT-3′; (reverse) 5′-GGTGTAGGGGTATTTTAAGA-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH): forward 5′-GAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTT-3′; reverse 5′-CAGGAGGCATTGCTGATGAT-3′ 3 PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min; and 45 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s (denaturation), 59 °C for 20 s (annealing), and 72 °C for 20 s (extension). The PCR products of TBX2 were cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and verified by sequencing. Nuclear extracts were prepared from WI-38 cells as previously described (25Lee K.A. Green M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For DAI assays, biotinylated DNA probes were generated by PCR using primer pairs that were synthesized and 5′-end-labeled with biotin (Forward: 5′-TGGCCTGAGCTGTCAAAAC-3′; Reverse: 5′-GCGCGACTGGTTAGATCTTG-3′), and immobilized on Dynabeads Streptavidin (Dynal Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each reaction, 40 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 1 μg of DNA probes in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)) in a final volume of 400 μl. The beads were extensively washed with binding buffer and then boiled in 25 μl of 2× loading buffer before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. ChIP assays were carried out as previously described (13Prince S. Carreira S. Vance K.W. Abrahams A. Goding C.R. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, WI-38 cells (60–70% confluence) were serum-starved 24 h prior to treatment with TPA or vehicle. Cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde after 8-h treatment. The chromatin was extracted, sonicated, and immunoprecipitated using antibodies against Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or phospho-histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology). DNA precipitation was analyzed by PCR using human TBX2-specific primer pairs (Forward: 5′-TGGCCTGAGCTGTCAAAAC-3′; Reverse: 5′-GCGCGACTGGTTAGATCTTG-3′). We have previously shown that TBX2 is expressed at high levels in the normal human lung fibroblast cell line, WI-38, but that it is expressed at very low levels in WI-38-transformed cell lines, CT-1 and SVWI-38 (24Teng H. Davis E. Abrahams A. Mowla S. Parker M.I. Prince S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 618-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To identify signaling pathways that regulate TBX2 expression, WI-38 cells were treated with TPA and TBX2 levels were examined by Western blot analysis. Our results showed that TPA significantly induced TBX2 expression in a time-dependent manner with levels increasing from 2 h and peaking at 8 h (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, TBX2 expression was strongly induced in the SVWI-38 and CT-1 cells treated with TPA for 8 h (Fig. 1B) suggesting that the TPA signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of TBX2 expression. To determine whether the above induction of TBX2 expression by TPA is due to an increase in transcription, cells were treated with or without TPA for a period spanning 1 h to 24 h and TBX2 mRNA levels assessed by real-time PCR. Our results showed that TBX2 mRNA levels were up-regulated from 2 h with levels peaking at 8 h (Fig. 1C) in WI-38 cells. Similarly, TBX2 mRNA levels increased when SVWI-38 and CT-1 cells were treated with TPA for 8 h (Fig. 1D). TBX2 mRNA levels therefore closely correlated with levels of TBX2 protein, which suggested that TPA induced TBX2 expression at a transcriptional level. It is well established that in response to TPA, PKCs can activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK MAPK pathway. Thus to investigate the pathway(s) by which TPA up-regulates TBX2 gene expression in WI-38 cells, we first examined the effect of TPA on the phosphorylation status of MAPKs by Western blot analyses. Fig. 2A shows that while TPA treatment had no effect on JNK phosphorylation, it led to an increase in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 up to 8 h and to a marginal increase in p38 phosphorylation at the 4-h time point. To assess the involvement of the above signaling molecules in TPA-induced expression of TBX2, we next pretreated WI-38 cells with inhibitors to PKC, ERK1/2, p38, and JNK before TPA treatment and then analyzed TBX2 expression by Western blotting. As expected, the PKC inhibitor (GF109203X) repressed TPA-induced TBX2 expression confirming that PKC is an important mediator of TBX2 regulation by the TPA pathway (Fig. 2B). It is important to note, that inhibiting PKC also resulted in reduced basal TBX2 expression, which implies that PKC may in fact be essential for TBX2 expression in WI-38 cells. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2B, at 8 h of TPA treatment both ERK1/2 (PD98059) and p38 (SB203580) inhibitors had no effect on the induction of TBX2 expression but the JNK inhibitor (SP600125) blocked TPA-induced TBX2 expression. Similar results were also obtained at 4 h of TPA treatment (data not shown) which implicated the JNK pathway in the TPA-mediated induction of TBX2. To determine the blocking efficiency and specificity of the above inhibitors, their effect on phosphorylation of their respective MAPKs were examined. Our results showed that PD98059 and SB203580 can effectively reduce phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38, respectively (Fig. 2C). Surprisingly, while TPA-mediated TBX2 expression was repressed by SP600125 (see Fig. 2B), TPA had no effect on JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 2, C and D). These results suggested that the effect of the SP600125 inhibitor on TBX2 expression was not due to the JNK pathway. It is well documented that TPA induces the expression of numerous genes through up-regulation of AP-1, and we therefore examined the expression of c-Jun and JunB in WI-38, SVWI-38, and CT-1 cells treated with or without TPA by Western blot analyses. Results showed that TPA increased both c-Jun and JunB protein levels in a time-dependent manner, which correlated with an up-regulation of TBX2 in all three cell lines tested (Fig. 3, A and B and see Fig. 1, A and B). To determine whether AP-1 can indeed regulate the TBX2 promoter we searched the 3000 bp 5′-flanking regulatory sequence of the human TBX2 gene, which was obtained from the human genome sequence data base, for potential cis-acting elements using the TFSEARCH program. A putative AP-1 site was found at −1069 relative to the transcriptional start site (data not shown), and we thus performed luciferase assays using a reporter construct driven by a 1638-bp sequence of the TBX2 gene containing this putative site (26Teng H. Parker M.I. Prince S. Gene. 2008; 423: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). TPA failed to stimulate transcriptional activity of the human TBX2 promoter in SVWI-38 and CT-1 cells (Fig. 3C), and overexpression of c-Jun or JunB did not significantly increase TBX2 promoter activity in HT1080 cells (Fig. 3D). As can been seen in Fig. 3, C and D, a reporter plasmid containing four AP-1 DNA binding sites fused to luciferase (4×AP-1-luciferase), which served as a positive control, was responsive to TPA, c-Jun, and JunB. These findings led us to hypothesize that either distal elements not present in the 1638 bp TBX2 regulatory fragment may be mediating the effects of TPA or that a chromatin remodeling mechanism may be involved in transcriptional regulation of TBX2 gene expression by TPA. Several lines of evidence suggest that translational modification of histone H3 leads to the activation of genes in a Sp1 site-dependent manner (24Teng H. Davis E. Abrahams A. Mowla S. Parker M.I. Prince S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 618-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 27Han J.W. Ahn S.H. Kim Y.K. Bae G.U. Yoon J.W. Hong S. Lee H.Y. Lee Y.W. Lee H.W. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2007; 179: 1760-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the basal transcription of the human TBX2 gene is dependent on a Sp1 site in its proximal promoter (26Teng H. Parker M.I. Prince S. Gene. 2008; 423: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This led us to ask the question as to whether TPA induces TBX2 expression through phosphorylating histone H3 and consequently recruiting Sp1 to the Sp1 site identified above. Western blot analyses were therefore performed to examine the effect of TPA on the phosphorylation status of histone H3 in WI-38 cells. Our results show that TPA treatment resulted in an increase in the levels of phosphorylated histone H3 at Ser-10 for up to 8 h (Fig. 4A), which was blocked by the PKC (GF109203X) and JNK (SP600125) inhibitors (Fig. 4B). Phosphorylation of histone H3-Ser-10 by TPA, therefore, correlated well with the regulation of TBX2 expression by TPA. We next examined whether TPA induced histone H3-Ser-10 phosphorylation at the TBX2 promoter using ChIP assays. Primers spanning the proximal promoter of TBX2 (Fig. 4C) were used for PCR amplification of immunoprecipitated DNA fragments and quantitative analysis was performed by real-time PCR. Compared with untreated cells, a ∼2-fold increase in histone H3-Ser-10 phosphorylation was obtained at the TBX2 promoter in WI-38 cells treated with TPA for 8 h (Fig. 4, C and D). To explore the possibility that TPA enhanced Sp1 binding to the TBX2 promoter, the same primers shown in Fig. 4C were used to amplify DNA fragments immunoprecipitated with an antibody specific to Sp1. A significant increase of Sp1 was observed at the TBX2 promoter in WI-38 cells treated with TPA (Fig. 4, C and D). Our results clearly show that TPA increased both histone H3-Ser-10 phosphorylation and Sp1 recruitment to a Sp1 site in the TBX2 proximal promoter, which correlated with the induction of TBX2 expression. These findings suggested that TPA-activated transcription of TBX2 through a mechanism involving the phosphorylation of histone H3 and consequent recruitment of Sp1 to the TBX2 proximal promoter.

Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18684-18690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have been proposed to phosphorylate histone H3 in response to various stimuli, current evidence suggests that MSK1 and 2 are the primary kinases involved (22Clayton A.L. Mahadevan L.C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated whether MSK1 was activated in WI-38 cells treated with TPA by reprobing the Western blots shown in Fig. 4, A and B with an antibody to phosphorylated MSK1. An increase in MSK1 phosphorylation was evident from 1 h and persisted over a period of 24 h of TPA treatment (Fig. 4A) and as seen for histone H3-Ser-10, phosphorylation was abolished by the PKC (GF109203X) and JNK (SP600125) inhibitors. The result obtained with the JNK inhibitor is worth commenting on at this stage because while results shown in Fig. 2, A, C, and D indicated that TPA did not significantly activate JNK in our system, the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, blocked TPA-induced expression of TBX2 (Fig. 2B), and the phosphorylation of histone H3-Ser-10 and MSK1 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, SP600125 has recently been identified to act as an inhibitor of histone H3-Ser-10 phosphorylation through an unknown mechanism (36Huang W. Batra S. Korrapati S. Mishra V. Mehta K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1307-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that SP600125 may repress phosphorylation of histone H3-Ser-10 through blocking MSK1 activation. Furthermore, these results raised the possibility that the TPA-induced TBX2 expression resulted from the phosphorylation of histone H3 by MSK1. To test this possibility, we knocked down MSK1 in WI-38 cells treated with or without TPA and examined the effect on phosphorylated histone H3-Ser-10 and TBX2 levels. Western blot analyses show that MSK1-specific siRNA results in substantial reduction in MSK1 levels since it was undetectable (Fig. 4E). As expected, cells transfected with control siRNA had increased levels of MSK1, phosphorylated histone H3-Ser-10, and TBX2. In contrast, these changes were abrogated in cells transfected with siMSK1. Our results thus confirm that in the absence of MSK1, TPA has no effect on levels of both phosphorylated histone H3-Ser-10 and TBX2. In summary, the above findings revealed a potential functional link between PKC and MSK1 activation during TPA-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3-Ser-10 and TBX2 expression. We have clearly shown here that TPA-induced phosphorylation of histone H3-Ser-10 was associated with recruitment of Sp1 to the human TBX2 gene. However, several lines of evidence have also shown that TPA-mediated expression of certain genes is associated with increased levels of total and/or phosphorylated Sp1 (37Samson S.L. Wong N.C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To test whether the TPA-mediated increase in TBX2 gene expression is also due to the latter mechanism involving increased levels of Sp1 we next examined the expression pattern of Sp1 in WI-38 cells treated with or without TPA. Western blotting, however, revealed that TPA treatment had no significant effect on total (Fig. 5A) and nuclear (Fig. 5B) Sp1 protein levels at time points tested. In addition, Sp1 protein levels remained unchanged when cells were pretreated with the PKC, JNK, p38, and ERK inhibitors (Fig. 5C). We finally explored the possibility that TPA treatment may enhance the affinity of Sp1 to bind to the proximal TBX2 promoter. Results from DNA affinity immunoblotting experiments showed that while the Sp1 site in the proximal TBX2 promoter was specifically bound by Sp1 (Fig. 5D, left), TPA treatment did not enhance this binding (Fig. 5D, right). Interestingly, an unlabeled probe was less able to compete with the labeled probe in nuclear extracts from TPA-treated cells, which suggests that TPA treatment may increase the stability of Sp1 binding (Fig. 5D, right). The mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of the TBX2 gene are still poorly understood. In view of the detrimental consequences resulting from altered levels of T-box proteins, as seen in both developmental disorders and in certain cancers, the need to identify such mechanisms is important. Here we demonstrate for the first time that TPA treatment of normal human fibroblasts (WI-38) leads to a time-dependent increase in TBX2 mRNA, and protein levels and we provide compelling evidence that this results from TPA-regulating TBX2 transcription through a process involving phosphorylation of histone H3. While it is well established that phosphorylation of histone H3 plays a critical role during transcriptional activation of IE genes in response to various stimuli, it has recently also been linked to transcriptional activation of several relative late response genes (22Clayton A.L. Mahadevan L.C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 38Ge Z. Liu C. Björkholm M. Gruber A. Xu D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here we show that TPA treatment leads to increases in histone H3-Ser-10 phosphorylation, which interestingly is associated with the recruitment of Sp1 to its cognate site in the TBX2 proximal promoter and the induction of TBX2 expression. This is in keeping with our previously published data, which identified this Sp1 site to play an important role in the regulation of TBX2 gene expression as it was shown to be essential in maintaining basal activity of a human TBX2 promoter (26Teng H. Parker M.I. Prince S. Gene. 2008; 423: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Moreover, when the phosphorylation of histone H3-Ser-10 was blocked, the TPA-mediated induction of TBX2 expression was abolished. These findings suggest that the mechanism by which TPA activates TBX2 gene expression involves phosphorylation of histone H3 and recruitment of Sp1 to the Sp1 site in the TBX2 proximal promoter. This study provides compelling data to show that MSK1 is the kinase responsible for phosphorylating histone H3 in response to TPA treatment. While MSK1 has been well characterized as a histone H3 kinase (30Soloaga A. Thomson S. Wiggin G.R. Rampersaud N. Dyson M.H. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Arthur J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2788-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 31Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), the ERK and/or p38 MAPK cascades have been demonstrated to phosphorylate histone H3 in response to mitogen- and stress-induced pathways in many different systems (22Clayton A.L. Mahadevan L.C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PKC has also been proposed to be responsible for histone H3-Ser-10 phosphorylation at the LDL receptor promoter in response to TPA in the human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells (34Huang W. Mishra V. Batra S. Dillon I. Mehta K.D. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1519-1527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that PKC may also directly phosphorylate histone H3-Ser-10, our findings clearly suggest that MSK1 is a potential downstream target of PKC in normal human fibroblasts and is linked to phosphorylation of histone H3. Interestingly, we found that MSK1 activation appears to occur via the Erk and/or p38 signaling pathways in our transformed CT-1 and SVWI38 fibroblasts and we failed to detect alterations in global phosphorylation of histone H3-Ser-10 in these cells (data not shown). These results points to a different mechanism of Tbx2 regulation by TPA in normal and transformed fibroblasts. This is not surprising considering that signal transduction pathways are frequently altered during transformation. In summary, we show that TPA activates MSK1, which is associated with phosphorylation of histone H3 in a PKC-dependent and MAPK-independent manner in normal human fibroblasts. In the current study, phosphorylated MSK1 levels increased at all the time points of TPA treatment tested while levels of global phosphorylated histone H3 remained unchanged for the later time points. This is consistent with the literature, which suggests that while global phosphorylation of histone H3 is required for chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis (39Gurley L.R. D'Anna J.A. Barham S.S. Deaven L.L. Tobey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 40Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar), in stimulus-mediated gene expression only a small fraction of histone H3 is transiently phosphorylated (22Clayton A.L. Mahadevan L.C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 41Johansen K.M. Johansen J. Chromosome Res. 2006; 14: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Stimulus-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 may therefore not be observed at a global level, and this may explain why we did not find an increase in global histone H3-Ser-10 phosphorylation at later time points of TPA treatment. Although we did not detect activation of JNK by TPA in our system, it is intriguing to note that the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, resulted in an apparent repression of TBX2 expression, which was associated with a reduction of global phosphorylation of histone H3. Consistent with our finding, SP600125 has been shown to reduce global histone H3-Ser-10 phosphorylation in a JNK MAPK-independent manner in the human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells (36Huang W. Batra S. Korrapati S. Mishra V. Mehta K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1307-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Importantly, SP600125 has also been shown to be capable of inhibiting a variety of kinases (42Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar), and our results indicated that SP600125 inhibits MSK1 activity. It is thus possible that in our system, SP600125 acts as an inhibitor of MSK1 and thus blocks phosphorylation of histone H3 leading to a reduction in TPA-stimulated TBX2 expression. This possibility is worthy of further investigation. Although TPA was reported to lead to an increase in Sp1 levels in several systems (43D'Angelo D.D. Oliver B.G. Davis M.G. Mccluskey T.S. Dorn G.W.

DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), our data show that TPA does not affect Sp1 protein levels. However, TPA was shown to significantly enhance stability of nuclear factor binding to the Sp1 site in the TBX2 proximal promoter. Interestingly, TPA-induced phosphorylation of Sp1 has been shown to enhance Sp1 binding and transcription activity in the human HepG2 cells (46Zheng X.L. Matsubara S. Diao C. Hollenberg M.D. Wong N.C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31747-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, whether Sp1 phosphorylation is also implicated in TPA-mediated transcription activation of the TBX2 gene remains to be elucidated. Finally, we show that while TPA up-regulates c-Jun/AP1 and JunB/AP1 expression, which correlates well with up-regulation of Tbx2, TPA, and c-Jun/JunB failed to activate a reporter gene driven by a 5′-regulatory region of the TBX2 gene. These findings provide indirect support for the possibility that TPA-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3-Ser-10 plays a critical role in transcriptional activation of the TBX2 gene. In conclusion, we show that in response to TPA, phosphorylation of histone H3 leads to the recruitment of Sp1 to a site in the proximal TBX2 gene promoter, which is required for TPA-mediated induction of TBX2 gene expression. Importantly, we show that this process involves the activation of MSK1 in a PKC-dependent manner (Fig. 6). Our findings give insight into the molecular mechanism(s) that regulate TBX2 gene expression.

Mechanical strain induction of MMP-13 is an example of how osteoblasts respond to high mechanical forces and participate in the bone-remodeling mechanism. Using MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells, we dissected the signaling molecules involved in MMP-13 induction by mechanical strain. Reverse transcription-PCR and zymogram analysis showed that platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitor, AG1296, inhibited the mechanical strain-induced MMP-13 gene and activity. However, the induction was not affected by anti-PDGF-AA serum. Immunoblot analysis revealed time-dependent phosphorylation of PDGFR-α up to 2.7-fold increases within 3 min under strain. Transfection with shPDGFR-α (at 4 and 8 μg/ml) abolished PDGFR-α and reduced MMP-13 expression. Moreover, time-dependent recruitments of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) by PDGFR-α were detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-PDGFR-α serum followed by immunoblot with anti-PI3K serum. AG1296 inhibited PDGFR-α/PI3K aggregation and Akt phosphorylation. Interestingly, protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ) inhibitor, rottlerin, inhibited not only PDGFR-α/PI3K aggregation but PDGFR-α phosphorylation. The sequential activations were further confirmed by mutants ΔPKC-δ, ΔAkt, and ΔERK1. Consistently, the primary mouse osteoblast cells used the same identified signaling molecules to express MMP-13 under mechanical strain. These results demonstrate that, in osteoblast-like cells, the MMP-13 induction by mechanical strain requires the transactivation of PDGFR-α by PKC-δ and the cross-talk between PDGFR-α/PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways.

Mechanical strain to bone is considered to be important for the maintenance of bone integrity and architecture. The process of bone (re)modeling under mechanical loading may repair fatigue damage and improve bone strength (1Burr D.B. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1993; 53: S75-S81Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 2Frost H.M. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1998; 62: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 3Lanyon L.E. Bone. 1996; 18: 37S-43SCrossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Such (re)modeling requires bone resorption and deposition by the concerted efforts of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Several studies have demonstrated that, in the absence of the systemic and local factors, mechanical loading on osteoblasts in vitro is able to increase prostaglandin release (4Somjen D. Binderman I. Berger E. Harell A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 627: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), stimulate cell division (5Hasegawa S. Sato S. Saito S. Suzuki Y. Brunette D.M. Calcif.

Other induced proteins such as insulin-like growth factors I and II, transforming growth factor-β, osteocalcin, osteopontin, nitric-oxide synthase, and cyclooxygease-2 have also been reported (8Liedert A.

The MMP-13 mRNA induction is transient, stable, and does not require de novo protein synthesis, suggesting that an immediate action be taken by strained osteoblasts to participate in the resorption phase of matrix (re)modeling. MMP-13 is a neutral proteinase capable of degrading native fibrillar collagens in the extracellular space (10Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3862) Google Scholar, 11Visse R. Nagase H. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (3615) Google Scholar). It may be involved in situations where rapid and effective remodeling of collagenous extracellular matrix is required. Hence, MMP-13 can be detected in primary fetal ossification during bone morphogenesis, and in remodeling of the mature skeletal tissue (12Gack S. Vallon R. Schmidt J. Grigoriadis A. Tuckermann J.

Mechanical strain induction of MMP-13 may be mediated through a process of mechanotransduction, converting physical forces into biochemical signals and integrating these signals into cellular responses. In our stretch chamber system, we showed that the mechanotransduction utilizes the MEK/ERK signaling pathway to implement MMP-13 expression (9Yang C.M. Chien C.S. Yao C.C. Hsiao L.D. Huang Y.C. Wu C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22158-22165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the transduction mechanism involved remains unclear and awaits further investigation. Three lines of studies have prompted us to investigate the receptor of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) as a potential mechanoreceptor in the MMP-13 induction. PDGF-BB induces MMP-13 expression in osteoblasts (14Varghese S. Delany A.M. Liang L. Gabbitas B. Jeffrey J.J. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15Rydziel S. Durant D. Canalis E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas in vascular smooth muscle cells the mechanical strain increases PDGF-B and PDGFR-β expression (16Ma Y.H. Ling S. Ivest H.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and activates PDGFR-α (17Hu Y. Böck G. Wick G. Xu Q. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The PDGFRs, including PDGFR-α and -β, are membrane glycoproteins of ∼170 and 180 kDa, respectively. Their structures are similar to those of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor and the stem cell factor receptor. The extracellular parts of PDGFR consist of five immunoglobulin-like domains, among which three outer-most domains are for ligand binding, and domain 4, for direct receptor-receptor interactions. The intracellular parts contain a tyrosine kinase domain, with characteristic inserted sequences without homology to kinases (18Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). The PDGFR-α binds all combinations of PDGF-A/-B forms, whereas PDGFR-β binds only PDGF-BB. The binding of the ligand induces dimerization of the PDGFR, leading to the activation via autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the PDGFR kinase domain. Inside the kinase domains, autophosphorylation increases the kinase activity, whereas, outside of it, autophosphorylation creates docking sites for the recruitment of cytoplasmic molecules containing SH domains as in enzyme, PI3K, or in adaptor protein, Grb2. To dissect the sequential signaling involved in the MMP-13 induction by mechanical strain, we applied mechanical stretching to MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells grown on a collagen-coated flexible membrane in the presence of inhibitors and dominant mutants of interest. We found that in osteoblast-like cells, the mechanical strain induced MMP-13 expression requires transactivation of PDGFR-α by PKC-δ. Murine MC3T3-E1 cell line was used as a homogeneous source of non-transformed osteoblast-like cells. Primary osteoblast cells were obtained from calvaria of neonatal mice (ICR-CD1) through standard protocol of collagenase digestion (19Buxton P.G. Bitar M. Gellynck K. Parkar M. Brown R.A. Young A.M. Knowles J.C. Nazhat S.N. Bone. 2008; 43: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fetal bovine serum, TRIzol, and minimal essential medium-α (α-MEM) were purchased from Invitrogen. The anti-MMP-13 monoclonal antibody was purchased from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA); anti-PDGF-AA serum, from R&D (Minneapolis, MN), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antiserum, from Biogenesis (Boumemouth, UK). The antibodies against PDGFR-α, PDGFR-β, and PI3K were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), whereas antibodies against phospho-PDGFR-α, phospho-PDGRF-β, and phospho-p42/p44 MAPK were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The reagents AG1296, AG1478, genistein, herbimycin A, rottlerin, GF109203X, Gö6976, and LY294002 were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit was from Pierce. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) immunoblotting detection system and Hyperfilms were from Amersham Biosciences. Type I collagen, enzymes, and other chemicals were from Sigma.

Ye (Dept. of Pharmacology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL), and P. Parker (Cancer Research Center, London, UK), respectively. The equibiaxial stretch chamber (9Yang C.M. Chien C.S. Yao C.C.

Waldman L.K. MacKenna D.A. Villarreal F.J. McCulloch A.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1400-C1408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to deliver uniform, isotropic, and static tensile strain to osteoblast-like cells in the absence of shear as previously described. The chambers were H2O2 gas-sterilized before use. Similar to the study of gene expression by applying a cyclic 8% stretch at a frequency of 0.5 Hz to human chondrosarcoma (21Karjalainen H.M. Sironen R.K. Elo M.A. Kaarniranta K. Takigawa M. Helminen H.J. Lammi M.J. Biorheology. 2003; 40: 93-100PubMed Google Scholar), in the present experiments, we used 8% stretch for the optimal expression of MAPKs as a reference. Nevertheless, to exclude the release of intracellular MMP-13 as a result of cell injury, media conditioned by control or tested cells was assayed for lactate dehydrogenase (22Sadoshima J. Jahn L. Takahashi T. Kulik T.J. Izumo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10551-10560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Vincent T.L. Hermansson M.A. Hansen U.N. Amis A.A. Saklatvala J. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). There was no significant difference in release of lactate dehydrogenase in the medium, and no slippage of the strained cells from the collagen-coated membrane with a prolonged period of time (9Yang C.M. Chien C.S. Yao C.C. Hsiao L.D. Huang Y.C. Wu C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22158-22165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells were grown in flasks to sub-confluence in α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum before plating to stretch chamber. The elastic sheets of the chamber were coated with a solution of 0.01% type I collagen overnight to promote cell attachment. Then, the MC3T3-E1 cells were transferred and plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 to the collagen-coated sheet and grown to confluence. After conditioning in serum-free α-MEM medium overnight, quiescent adherent cells were stretched under testing condition. For experimental purposes, the selective inhibitors (all at 10 μm concentration) were added 1 h before testing. Control cells were treated in an identical fashion as test cells, yet without being stretched. Test and control experiments were carried out simultaneously with the same pool of cells in each experiment to match temperature, CO2 content, and pH of the medium for the test and control cells. Briefly, aliquots of the control and test media were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 1.25% gelatin. Afterward, the gel was washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS, rinsed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then incubated overnight at room temperature with the developing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, 0.02% thimerosal, 1% Triton X-100). The zymographic activities were revealed by staining with 1% Coomassie Blue and later, destaining of the gel and were quantified by laser densitometry of the corresponding bands in the linear response of the gelatin zymogram. The adherent cells were harvested after being stretched for the time indicated. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions and quantified by optical density. 1 μg of total RNA was added to a reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction in RT buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dNTPs, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg of oligo(dT) primer, 200 units of SuperScript II RT, and RNase H. 5 μl of cDNA from the RT was added directly to a 50-μl PCR containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dNTP, 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase. The amplification conditions for MMP-13 were as follows: 94 °C/1 min, 62 °C/1 min, and 72 °C/2 min, which was amplified for 30 cycles. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to span at least one intron to detect any contaminating genomic DNA carried over from the RNA isolation step. The β-actin primer sequences have been described previously (Ambion), and MMP-13 primer sequences were derived from the mouse MMP-13 sequence (24Henriet P. Rousseau G.G. Eeckhout Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) as follows: MMP-13, sense primer 5′-GGT CCC AAA CGA ACT TAA CTT ACA-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CCT TGA ACG TCA TCA TCA GGA AGC-3′, a total of 445 bp. Conditions were established so that PCR was stopped in the linear range, and the reaction products could be accurately quantified and compared. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels. Ethidium bromide staining of the bands corresponding to MMP-13 was photographed and digitized. Density analysis was performed using the UN-SCAN-IT gel program (Silk Scientific, Inc. Orem, UT). The levels of MMP-13 mRNA were normalized to those of β-actin RNA to correct for differences in loading and/or transferring. Unless mentioned otherwise, protein concentrations were determined (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. MC3T3-E1s in control or in test (by 8% stretch) groups were incubated for various times before subjected to cell lysis as described previously (9Yang C.M. Chien C.S. Yao C.C. Hsiao L.D. Huang Y.C. Wu C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22158-22165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). At the termination of mechanical stimulation, cells were rapidly washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice, and lysed on ice in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na2VO4, 2.5 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors such as 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to yield the cell extract. Equal amounts of samples were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and were then blotted to nitrocellulose membrane. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated at room temperature with 5% bovine serum albumin in TTBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h. The total protein profiles and the phosphorylated forms of the kinases were identified by immunoblot analysis with anti-serum raised against the signaling molecules or their phosphorylated forms. Briefly, membranes were incubated with a 1:1000 diluted solution of specific anti-PDGF-α, anti-phospho-PDGFR-α, anti-phospho-Akt, anti-phospho-p42/p44 MAPK, anti-PI3K, or anti-GAPDH antibodies, and then with the second antibody (anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin/TTBS; 1:1500 dilution). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) system. Cell lysates containing 1 mg of protein were incubated with 2 μg of anti-PDGFR-α antibody at 4 °C for 1 h, and then 10 μl of 50% protein A-agarose beads was added and mixed for 16 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates by anti-PDGFR-α serum were collected and washed three times with lysis buffer without Triton X-100, dissolved in 5× Laemmli buffer, and then subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-PI3K and anti-PDGFR-α serum. The vector pTOPO-U6 II was constructed by inserting the short hairpin RNA expression cassette containing the mouse U6 promoter and the termination signal of RNA polymerase III into the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), the procedure of which was similar to that of the pTOPO-U6 construction (26Tseng C.P.

Minor modifications were made to build the AvrII and BbsI sites outside of the inserted, designed 22-oligomer short hairpin RNA sequences (Fig. 3A). For the plasmid PDGFR-α_778, and PDGFR-β_2572, the complementary oligonucleotides PDGFR-α_778 sense (5′-CTAGACGTTCAAGACCAGCGAGTTTACAAGCTTCTAAACTCGCTGGTCTTGAACGT-3) and PDGFR-α_778 antisense (5′-AAAAACGTTCAAGACCAGCGAGTTTAGAAGCTTGTAAACTCGCTGGTCTTGAACGT-3′), and PDGFR-β_2572 sense (5′-CTAGGGCATGGACTTCTTAGCCTCTACAAGCTTCTAGAGGCTAAGAAGTCCATGCC-3′) and PDGFR-β_2572 antisense (5′-AAAAGGCATGGACTTCTTAGCCTCTAGAAGCTTGTAGAGGCTAAGAAGTCCATGCC-3′) were annealed, respectively, as described by Tseng et al.

For small interfering RNA of firefly luciferase, the complementary oligonucleotides FflS and FflAS were constructed and reported previously (27Huang C.L. Cheng J.C. Liao C.H. Stern A. Hsieh J.T.

The plasmids encoding ΔERK1 K52R, ΔMEK K97R, and ΔPKC-δ (dominant negative mutants of ERK1 and MEK1/2) were prepared by using Qiagen plasmid DNA preparation kits. For transfection, the amount of plasmid (1 μg) was kept constant for each experiment. The DNA PLUS-Lipofectamine reagent complex was prepared according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The adherent MC3T3-E1 cells grown to 70% confluence were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then with serum-free α-MEM medium and then transfected and incubated with plasmid in serum-free α-MEM (0.8 ml) and DNA PLUS-Lipofectamine reagent (0.2 ml) at 37 °C for 5 h and later with α-MEM (1 ml) containing 10% fetal bovine serum overnight. After 24 h of transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and maintained in α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for an additional 24 h. Before applying an 8% stretch, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with serum-free α-MEM for 24 h. Data were presented as mean ± S.D. Statistical comparisons of control group with treated groups were carried out using the paired sample t test with p values corrected by the Bonferroni method. Comparisons among three or more groups were made by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's post hoc analysis. An effect was considered significant when p < 0.05. In this study, we investigated whether the signaling molecules at the level of plasma membrane-associated receptor tyrosine kinases may be involved in MMP-13 expression by mechanical strain. The inhibitors used as diagnostic tools included genistein and herbimycin A for blocking the protein-tyrosine kinases in general, and specifically, AG1296 and AG1478 for blocking the receptor tyrosine kinases such as PDGFR and EGFR, respectively. The zymogram revealed that the mechanical strain-induced MMP-13 activities were partly blocked by pretreatment with AG1296 (Fig. 1A). However, AG1478 failed to inhibit the activities. Moreover, the RT-PCR analysis reflected the above finding of the AG1296 by matching the reduction of MMP-13 gene with that of activity under mechanical insults (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data suggested that the PDGFR participates in the mechanical strain-induced MMP-13 expression. Because PDGF-A mRNA expression was reported to be induced by mechanical strain within 2 h in MC3T3-E1s (28Wang W. Zhuang H. Levitz C.L. Fan H. Seldes R.M. Tahernia A.D. Brighton C.T. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 43: 339-346PubMed Google Scholar), one may question whether MMP-13 expression was a secondary effect as a result of PDGF-AA production induced by mechanical insult to cells. Here, pretreatment with anti-PDGF-AA serum did not interfere with MMP-13 activities, and protein expression induced by mechanical strain (Fig. 1C). The accountability of the anti-PDGF-AA serum to neutralize PDGF-AA was assured by the following experiment. MC3T3-E1s were pretreated with PDGF-AA (10 ng/ml) to induce MMP-13 expression in the presence or absence of anti-PDGF-AA serum (Fig. 1D). The results showed that MMP-13 expressions increased by prolonged incubation with PDGF alone. However, the increased amount of MMP-13 by PDGF-AA returned to basal level in the presence of anti-PDGF-AA serum. Taken together, these data suggested that the mechanical induction of MMP-13 be independent of PDGF-AA effect. The PDGFR consists of PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β forms. We examined which of the PDGFRs might be involved in the mechanical strain-induced MMP-13 expression by immunoblot analysis with anti-PDGFR-α or with anti-PDGFR-β serum to determine the amount of the proteins present, then with anti-phospho-PDGFR-α and -β serum to detect the state of activation, or lastly with anti-GAPDH serum as an internal control (Fig. 2). We noted that only trace amounts of the PDGFR-β were present within cells. Overwhelmingly, the PDGFR-α form appeared to be dominant in quantity over PDGFR-β form (Fig. 2A, rows 2 and 4). When challenged by mechanical strain, the PDGFR-α form became phosphorylated and activated. The receptor activation of the phosphorylated PDGFR-α was a fast process. It peaked at 3 min with 2.7-fold increases and then declined gradually at 30 min (Fig. 2B). Within such a short time, obviously, the total amounts of both PDGFR-α and GAPDH did not change. On the other hand, neither PDGFR-β nor EGFR (data not shown) appeared to be activated throughout the course of challenge. Thus, these results indicated that, under a static stretch condition, the PDGFR-α phosphorylation occurred in a time-dependent manner. To confirm the participation of the PDGFR-α in the MMP-13 induction by mechanical strain, we designed a short hairpin RNA of PDGFR-α (shPDGFR-α) (Fig. 3A) to knock down the PDGFR-α in vivo and then traced the consequences after mechanical insults. Cells were transfected with shPDGFR-α, vector alone (pTOPO-U6II), or small interfering RNA targeting firefly luciferase (Ffl) (27Huang C.L. Cheng J.C. Liao C.H. Stern A. Hsieh J.T. Wang C.H. Hsu H.L. Tseng C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42279-42289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), incubated for additional 24 h, and afterward, serum-free conditioned overnight before testing for 30 min. The MMP-13 activities were enhanced by mechanical strain in control cells and in cells transfected with either vector or Ffl. Such enhancements were diminished in cells transfected with the shPDGFR-α at doses of 4 and 8 μg/ml (Fig. 3, B and C). Immunoblot analysis with anti-PDGFR-α or anti-MMP-13 serum revealed that the shPDGFR-α knocked down the PDGFR-α protein expression and correspondingly, attenuated the mechanical strain-induced MMP-13 expression (Fig. 3C, lanes 7–10). Contrarily, vector or Ffl alone did not alter the amount of PDGFR-α expression (Fig. 3C, lanes 3–6). To sum up, the results confirmed that PDGFR-α, at the level of plasma membrane-associated receptor tyrosine kinase, participated in the mechanical strain induced MMP-13 expression. In line with this, the role of the PDGFR-α was further identified by the subsequent investigations in signaling relay leading to MMP-13 expression. Upon activation by stimuli, the PDGFR-α recruits the cytoplasmic molecule such as PI3K that contains conserved SH domain. The PI3K, an enzyme, was identified in our stretch system via immunoprecipitation from tested MC3T3-E1s with anti-PDGFR-α serum followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-PI3K serum. Even though the amounts of PDGFR-α remained constant with or without strain, the recruitment of PI3K by PDGFR-α started within 1 min of testing and reached 3-fold increases or higher from 3 to 5 min (Fig. 4A). Such recruitments were blocked by pretreatment with AG1296 (Fig. 4B, lane 6), indicating an association of PI3K with PDGFR-α. Pretreatment with AG1478, LY294002, or IgG (Fig. 4B, lane 11) did not affect the association. The blockade by rottlerin (Fig. 4B, lanes 9–10) is separately described in the next section. To confirm the finding that the PDGFR-α/PI3K pathway was involved in MMP-13 induction, sequential activation of the PDGFR-α and PI3K complex was analyzed by immunoblot with anti-PDGFR-α and anti-phospho-PDGFR-α serum (Fig. 5A). In this experiment, pretreatment with AG1296 inhibited the mechanical strain-stimulated phosphorylation of PDGFR-α, whereas LY294002 did not (Fig. 5A, lane 6), confirming that PI3K was downstream of PDGFR-α. On the other hand, both inhibitors blocked the MMP-13 gene expression induced by mechanical strain (Fig. 5B). The effects of PKC inhibitors, including GF109203X, Gö6976, and rottlerin, on PDGFR-α phosphorylation and MMP-13 gene expression (Fig. 5, A and B) are described below. To sum up, we concluded that mechanical strain-induced MMP-13 expression was mediated via PDGFR-α/PI3K signaling. To trace signaling relay downstream of PI3K, the PDGFR/PI3K/Akt (29Chaudhary L.R.

https://openalex.org/W1972877155,"Myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2) binds Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide with high affinity and is essential for Toll-like receptor 4-dependent signal transduction. MD-2 has recently been recognized as a type II acute phase protein. Plasma concentrations of the soluble form of MD-2 increase markedly during the course of severe infections. Its production is regulated in hepatocytes and myeloid cells by interleukin-6 (IL-6) but not IL-1beta. In the present work we show that two transcription factors (TF), PU.1 and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta), participate in the activation of the human MD-2 gene in hepatocytic cells after stimulation with IL-6. PU.1 TF and proximal PU.1 binding sites in the MD-2 promoter were shown to be critical for the basal activity of the promoter as well as for IL-6-induced soluble MD-2 production. Deletions of proximal portions of the MD-2 promoter containing PU.1 and/or NF-IL-6 consensus binding sites as well as site-directed mutagenesis of these binding sites abrogated IL-6-dependent MD-2 gene activation. We show that the cooperation between C/EBPbeta and PU.1 is critical for the transcriptional activation of the MD-2 gene by IL-6. PU.1 was essentially known as a TF involved in the differentiation of myeloid precursor cells and the expression of surface receptors of the innate immunity. Herein, we show that it also participates in the regulation of an acute phase protein, MD-2, in nonmyeloid cells cooperatively with C/EBPbeta, a classical IL-6-inducible TF."
https://openalex.org/W2084703681,"We report a novel strategy to engineer and express stable and soluble human recombinant polyvalent/polyspecific fusion proteins. The procedure is based on the use of a central skeleton of uteroglobin, a small and very soluble covalently linked homodimeric protein that is very resistant to proteolytic enzymes and to pH variations. Using a human recombinant antibody (scFv) specific for the angiogenesis marker domain B of fibronectin, interleukin 2, and an scFv able to neutralize tumor necrosis factor-alpha, we expressed various biologically active uteroglobin fusion proteins. The results demonstrate the possibility to generate monospecific divalent and tetravalent antibodies, immunocytokines, and dual specificity tetravalent antibodies. Furthermore, compared with similar fusion proteins in which uteroglobin was not used, the use of uteroglobin improved properties of solubility and stability. Indeed, in the reported cases it was possible to vacuum dry and reconstitute the proteins without any aggregation or loss in protein and biological activity."
