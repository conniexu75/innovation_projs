https://openalex.org/W2100651747,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in cancer development. By cloning and sequencing of a HPV16+ CaSki cell small RNA library, we isolated 174 miRNAs (including the novel miR-193c) which could be grouped into 46 different miRNA species, with miR-21, miR-24, miR-27a, and miR-205 being most abundant. We chose for further study 10 miRNAs according to their cloning frequency and associated their levels in 10 cervical cancer- or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-derived cell lines. No correlation was observed between their expression with the presence or absence of an integrated or episomal HPV genome. All cell lines examined contained no detectable miR-143 and miR-145. HPV-infected cell lines expressed a different set of miRNAs when grown in organotypic raft cultured as compared to monolayer cell culture, including expression of miR-143 and miR-145. This suggests a correlation between miRNA expression and tissue differentiation. Using miRNA array analyses for age-matched normal cervix and cervical cancer tissues, in combination with northern blot verification, we identified significantly deregulated miRNAs in cervical cancer tissues, with miR-126, miR-143, and miR-145 downregulation and miR-15b, miR-16, miR-146a, and miR-155 upregulation. Functional studies showed that both miR-143 and miR-145 are suppressive to cell growth. When introduced into cell lines, miR-146a was found to promote cell proliferation. Collectively, our data indicate that downregulation of miR-143 and miR-145 and upregulation of miR-146a play a role in cervical carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2056295530,"Herpesviruses are characterized by their ability to maintain life-long latent infections in their animal hosts. However, the mechanisms that allow establishment and maintenance of the latent state remain poorly understood. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) establishes latency in neurons of sensory ganglia, where the only abundant viral gene product is a non-coding RNA, the latency associated transcript (LAT). Here we show that LAT functions as a primary microRNA (miRNA) precursor that encodes four distinct miRNAs in HSV-1 infected cells. One of these miRNAs, miR-H2-3p, is transcribed in an antisense orientation to ICP0-a viral immediate-early transcriptional activator that is important for productive HSV-1 replication and thought to have a role in reactivation from latency. We show that miR-H2-3p is able to reduce ICP0 protein expression, but does not significantly affect ICP0 messenger RNA levels. We also identified a fifth HSV-1 miRNA in latently infected trigeminal ganglia, miR-H6, which derives from a previously unknown transcript distinct from LAT. miR-H6 shows extended seed complementarity to the mRNA encoding a second HSV-1 transcription factor, ICP4, and inhibits expression of ICP4, which is required for expression of most HSV-1 genes during productive infection. These results may explain the reported ability of LAT to promote latency. Thus, HSV-1 expresses at least two primary miRNA precursors in latently infected neurons that may facilitate the establishment and maintenance of viral latency by post-transcriptionally regulating viral gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2019023589,"Ca(2+)-release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels generate sustained Ca(2+) signals that are essential for a range of cell functions, including antigen-stimulated T lymphocyte activation and proliferation. Recent studies have revealed that the depletion of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers the oligomerization of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), the ER Ca(2+) sensor, and its redistribution to ER-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions where the CRAC channel subunit ORAI1 accumulates in the plasma membrane and CRAC channels open. However, how the loss of ER Ca(2+) sets into motion these coordinated molecular rearrangements remains unclear. Here we define the relationships among [Ca(2+)](ER), STIM1 redistribution and CRAC channel activation and identify STIM1 oligomerization as the critical [Ca(2+)](ER)-dependent event that drives store-operated Ca(2+) entry. In human Jurkat leukaemic T cells expressing an ER-targeted Ca(2+) indicator, CRAC channel activation and STIM1 redistribution follow the same function of [Ca(2+)](ER), reaching half-maximum at approximately 200 microM with a Hill coefficient of approximately 4. Because STIM1 binds only a single Ca(2+) ion, the high apparent cooperativity suggests that STIM1 must first oligomerize to enable its accumulation at ER-PM junctions. To assess directly the causal role of STIM1 oligomerization in store-operated Ca(2+) entry, we replaced the luminal Ca(2+)-sensing domain of STIM1 with the 12-kDa FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein (FKBP12, also known as FKBP1A) or the FKBP-rapamycin binding (FRB) domain of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR, also known as FRAP1). A rapamycin analogue oligomerizes the fusion proteins and causes them to accumulate at ER-PM junctions and activate CRAC channels without depleting Ca(2+) from the ER. Thus, STIM1 oligomerization is the critical transduction event through which Ca(2+) store depletion controls store-operated Ca(2+) entry, acting as a switch that triggers the self-organization and activation of STIM1-ORAI1 clusters at ER-PM junctions."

https://openalex.org/W2019077723,"Sister chromatid cohesion, which is essential for mitosis, is mediated by a multi-subunit protein complex called cohesin. Cohesin's Scc1, Smc1 and Smc3 subunits form a tripartite ring structure, and it has been proposed that cohesin holds sister DNA molecules together by trapping them inside its ring. To test this, we used site-specific crosslinking to create chemical connections at the three interfaces between the three constituent polypeptides of the ring, thereby creating covalently closed cohesin rings. As predicted by the ring entrapment model, this procedure produced dimeric DNA-cohesin structures that are resistant to protein denaturation. We conclude that cohesin rings concatenate individual sister minichromosome DNA molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2028283509,"Dysregulation of the alternative pathway (AP) of complement cascade has been implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. To further test the hypothesis that defective control of complement activation underlies AMD, parameters of complement activation in blood plasma were determined together with disease-associated genetic markers in AMD patients. Plasma concentrations of activation products C3d, Ba, C3a, C5a, SC5b-9, substrate proteins C3, C4, factor B and regulators factor H and factor D were quantified in patients (n = 112) and controls (n = 67). Subjects were analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphisms in factor H (CFH), factor B-C2 (BF-C2) and complement C3 (C3) genes which were previously found to be associated with AMD. All activation products, especially markers of chronic complement activation Ba and C3d (p<0.001), were significantly elevated in AMD patients compared to controls. Similar alterations were observed in factor D, but not in C3, C4 or factor H. Logistic regression analysis revealed better discriminative accuracy of a model that is based only on complement activation markers Ba, C3d and factor D compared to a model based on genetic markers of the complement system within our study population. In both the controls' and AMD patients' group, the protein markers of complement activation were correlated with CFH haplotypes. This study is the first to show systemic complement activation in AMD patients. This suggests that AMD is a systemic disease with local disease manifestation at the ageing macula. Furthermore, the data provide evidence for an association of systemic activation of the alternative complement pathway with genetic variants of CFH that were previously linked to AMD susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2003026101,"Chemotaxis in Caenorhabditis elegans, like chemotaxis in bacteria, involves a random walk biased by the time derivative of attractant concentration, but how the derivative is computed is unknown. Laser ablations have shown that the strongest deficits in chemotaxis to salts are obtained when the ASE chemosensory neurons (ASEL and ASER) are ablated, indicating that this pair has a dominant role. Although these neurons are left-right homologues anatomically, they exhibit marked asymmetries in gene expression and ion preference. Here, using optical recordings of calcium concentration in ASE neurons in intact animals, we demonstrate an additional asymmetry: ASEL is an ON-cell, stimulated by increases in NaCl concentration, whereas ASER is an OFF-cell, stimulated by decreases in NaCl concentration. Both responses are reliable yet transient, indicating that ASE neurons report changes in concentration rather than absolute levels. Recordings from synaptic and sensory transduction mutants show that the ON-OFF asymmetry is the result of intrinsic differences between ASE neurons. Unilateral activation experiments indicate that the asymmetry extends to the level of behavioural output: ASEL lengthens bouts of forward locomotion (runs) whereas ASER promotes direction changes (turns). Notably, the input and output asymmetries of ASE neurons are precisely those of a simple yet novel neuronal motif for computing the time derivative of chemosensory information, which is the fundamental computation of C. elegans chemotaxis. Evidence for ON and OFF cells in other chemosensory networks suggests that this motif may be common in animals that navigate by taste and smell."
https://openalex.org/W1984126846,"Broad regions on both sides of the solar wind termination shock are populated by high intensities of non-thermal ions and electrons. The pre-shock particles in the solar wind have been measured by the spacecraft Voyager 1 (refs 1-5) and Voyager 2 (refs 3, 6). The post-shock particles in the heliosheath have also been measured by Voyager 1 (refs 3-5). It was not clear, however, what effect these particles might have on the physics of the shock transition until Voyager 2 crossed the shock on 31 August-1 September 2007 (refs 7-9). Unlike Voyager 1, Voyager 2 is making plasma measurements. Data from the plasma and magnetic field instruments on Voyager 2 indicate that non-thermal ion distributions probably have key roles in mediating dynamical processes at the termination shock and in the heliosheath. Here we report that intensities of low-energy ions measured by Voyager 2 produce non-thermal partial ion pressures in the heliosheath that are comparable to (or exceed) both the thermal plasma pressures and the scalar magnetic field pressures. We conclude that these ions are the >0.028 MeV portion of the non-thermal ion distribution that determines the termination shock structure and the acceleration of which extracts a large fraction of bulk-flow kinetic energy from the incident solar wind."

https://openalex.org/W2012693665,"Background The typical mandate in conservation planning is to identify areas that represent biodiversity targets within the smallest possible area of land or sea, despite the fact that area may be a poor surrogate for the cost of many conservation actions. It is also common for priorities for conservation investment to be identified without regard to the particular conservation action that will be implemented. This demonstrates inadequate problem specification and may lead to inefficiency: the cost of alternative conservation actions can differ throughout a landscape, and may result in dissimilar conservation priorities. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigate the importance of formulating conservation planning problems with objectives and cost data that relate to specific conservation actions. We identify priority areas in Australia for two alternative conservation actions: land acquisition and stewardship. Our analyses show that using the cost surrogate that most closely reflects the planned conservation action can cut the cost of achieving our biodiversity goals by half. We highlight spatial differences in relative priorities for land acquisition and stewardship in Australia, and provide a simple approach for determining which action should be undertaken where. Conclusions/Significance Our study shows that a poorly posed conservation problem that fails to pre-specify the planned conservation action and incorporate cost a priori can lead to expensive mistakes. We can be more efficient in achieving conservation goals by clearly specifying our conservation objective and parameterising the problem with economic data that reflects this objective."
https://openalex.org/W1987200512,"Most biological processes are regulated through complex networks of transient protein interactions where a globular domain in one protein recognizes a linear peptide from another, creating a relatively small contact interface. Although sufficient to ensure binding, these linear motifs alone are usually too short to achieve the high specificity observed, and additional contacts are often encoded in the residues surrounding the motif (i.e. the context). Here, we systematically identified all instances of peptide-mediated protein interactions of known three-dimensional structure and used them to investigate the individual contribution of motif and context to the global binding energy. We found that, on average, the context is responsible for roughly 20% of the binding and plays a crucial role in determining interaction specificity, by either improving the affinity with the native partner or impeding non-native interactions. We also studied and quantified the topological and energetic variability of interaction interfaces, finding a much higher heterogeneity in the context residues than in the consensus binding motifs. Our analysis partially reveals the molecular mechanisms responsible for the dynamic nature of peptide-mediated interactions, and suggests a global evolutionary mechanism to maximise the binding specificity. Finally, we investigated the viability of non-native interactions and highlight cases of potential cross-reaction that might compensate for individual protein failure and establish backup circuits to increase the robustness of cell networks."
https://openalex.org/W2144156189,"Background Epidemiological studies suggest that people who consume more than one portion of cruciferous vegetables per week are at lower risk of both the incidence of prostate cancer and of developing aggressive prostate cancer but there is little understanding of the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we quantify and interpret changes in global gene expression patterns in the human prostate gland before, during and after a 12 month broccoli-rich diet. Methods and Findings Volunteers were randomly assigned to either a broccoli-rich or a pea-rich diet. After six months there were no differences in gene expression between glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) positive and null individuals on the pea-rich diet but significant differences between GSTM1 genotypes on the broccoli-rich diet, associated with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signalling pathways. Comparison of biopsies obtained pre and post intervention revealed more changes in gene expression occurred in individuals on a broccoli-rich diet than in those on a pea-rich diet. While there were changes in androgen signalling, regardless of diet, men on the broccoli diet had additional changes to mRNA processing, and TGFβ1, EGF and insulin signalling. We also provide evidence that sulforaphane (the isothiocyanate derived from 4-methylsuphinylbutyl glucosinolate that accumulates in broccoli) chemically interacts with TGFβ1, EGF and insulin peptides to form thioureas, and enhances TGFβ1/Smad-mediated transcription. Conclusions These findings suggest that consuming broccoli interacts with GSTM1 genotype to result in complex changes to signalling pathways associated with inflammation and carcinogenesis in the prostate. We propose that these changes may be mediated through the chemical interaction of isothiocyanates with signalling peptides in the plasma. This study provides, for the first time, experimental evidence obtained in humans to support observational studies that diets rich in cruciferous vegetables may reduce the risk of prostate cancer and other chronic disease.

https://openalex.org/W2122334403,"Early theorists (Freud and Darwin) speculated that extremely shy children, or those with anxious temperament, were likely to have anxiety problems as adults. More recent studies demonstrate that these children have heightened responses to potentially threatening situations reacting with intense defensive responses that are characterized by behavioral inhibition (BI) (inhibited motor behavior and decreased vocalizations) and physiological arousal. Confirming the earlier impressions, data now demonstrate that children with this disposition are at increased risk to develop anxiety, depression, and comorbid substance abuse. Additional key features of anxious temperament are that it appears at a young age, it is a stable characteristic of individuals, and even in non-threatening environments it is associated with increased psychic anxiety and somatic tension. To understand the neural underpinnings of anxious temperament, we performed imaging studies with 18-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) high-resolution Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in young rhesus monkeys. Rhesus monkeys were used because they provide a well validated model of anxious temperament for studies that cannot be performed in human children. Imaging the same animal in stressful and secure contexts, we examined the relation between regional metabolic brain activity and a trait-like measure of anxious temperament that encompasses measures of BI and pituitary-adrenal reactivity. Regardless of context, results demonstrated a trait-like pattern of brain activity (amygdala, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, hippocampus, and periaqueductal gray) that is predictive of individual phenotypic differences. Importantly, individuals with extreme anxious temperament also displayed increased activity of this circuit when assessed in the security of their home environment. These findings suggest that increased activity of this circuit early in life mediates the childhood temperamental risk to develop anxiety and depression. In addition, the findings provide an explanation for why individuals with anxious temperament have difficulty relaxing in environments that others perceive as non-stressful."
https://openalex.org/W1970705129,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been widely used and are a major therapeutic advance in psychopharmacology. However, their pharmacology is quite heterogeneous. The SSRI fluvoxamine, with sigma-1 receptor agonism, is shown to potentiate nerve-growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth in PC 12 cells. However, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying potentiation by fluvoxamine are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the roles of cellular signaling pathways in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by fluvoxamine and sigma-1 receptor agonists.The effects of three SSRIs (fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine) and three sigma-1 receptor agonists (SA4503, 4-phenyl-1-(4-phenylbutyl) piperidine (PPBP), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-sulfate) on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells were examined. Also examined were the effects of the sigma-1 receptor antagonist NE-100, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP(3)) receptor antagonist, and specific inhibitors of signaling pathways in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by selective sigma-1 receptor agonist SA4503. Fluvoxamine (but not sertraline or paroxetine) and the sigma-1 receptor agonists SA4503, PPBP, and DHEA-sulfate significantly potentiated NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The potentiation by fluvoxamine and the three sigma-1 receptor agonists was blocked by co-administration of the selective sigma-1 receptor antagonist NE-100, suggesting that sigma-1 receptors play a role in blocking the enhancement of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Moreover, the potentiation by SA4503 was blocked by co-administration of the IP(3) receptor antagonist xestospongin C. In addition, the specific inhibitors of phospholipase C (PLC-gamma), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), p38MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways blocked the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by SA4503.These findings suggest that stimulation of sigma-1 receptors and subsequent interaction with IP(3) receptors, PLC-gamma, PI3K, p38MAPK, JNK, and the Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathways are involved in the mechanisms of action of sigma-1 receptor agonists such as fluvoxamine and SA4503."
https://openalex.org/W2168147961,"We had previously shown that both locally produced endocannabinoids and exocannabinoids, via cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1), are powerful inhibitors of human hair growth. To further investigate the role of the cannabinoid system in pilosebaceous unit biology, we have explored in the current study whether and how endocannabinoids have an impact on human sebaceous gland biology, using human SZ95 sebocytes as cell culture model. Here, we provide the first evidence that SZ95 sebocytes express CB2 but not CB1. Also, prototypic endocannabinoids (arachidonoyl ethanolamide/anandamide, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol) are present in SZ95 sebocytes and dose-dependently induce lipid production and (chiefly apoptosis-driven) cell death. Endocannabinoids also up-regulate the expression of key genes involved in lipid synthesis (e.g., PPAR transcription factors and some of their target genes). These actions are selectively mediated by CB2-coupled signaling involving the MAPK pathway, as revealed by specific agonists/antagonists and by RNA interference. Because cells with ""silenced"" CB2 exhibited significantly suppressed basal lipid production, our results collectively suggest that human sebocytes utilize a paracrine-autocrine, endogenously active, CB2-mediated endocannabinoid signaling system for positively regulating lipid production and cell death. CB2 antagonists or agonists therefore deserve to be explored in the management of skin disorders characterized by sebaceous gland dysfunctions (e.g., acne vulgaris, seborrhea, dry skin)."
https://openalex.org/W1977661076,"Jarid1c, an X-linked gene coding for a histone demethylase, plays an important role in brain development and function. Notably, JARID1C mutations cause mental retardation and increased aggression in humans. These phenotypes are consistent with the expression patterns we have identified in mouse brain where Jarid1c mRNA was detected in hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. Jarid1c expression and associated active histone marks at its 5'end are high in P19 neurons, indicating that JARID1C demethylase plays an important role in differentiated neuronal cells. We found that XX mice expressed Jarid1c more highly than XY mice, independent of their gonadal types (testes versus ovaries). This increased expression in XX mice is consistent with Jarid1c escape from X inactivation and is not compensated by expression from the Y-linked paralogue Jarid1d, which is expressed at a very low level compared to the X paralogue in P19 cells. Our observations suggest that sex-specific expression of Jarid1c may contribute to sex differences in brain function."
https://openalex.org/W2034292153,"Cysteine-string protein (CSP) is an extensively palmitoylated DnaJ-family chaperone, which exerts an important neuroprotective function. Palmitoylation is required for the intracellular sorting and function of CSP, and thus it is important to understand how this essential modification of CSP is regulated. Recent work identified 23 putative palmitoyl transferases containing a conserved DHHC domain in mammalian cells, and here we show that palmitoylation of CSP is enhanced specifically by co-expression of the Golgi-localized palmitoyl transferases DHHC3, DHHC7, DHHC15, or DHHC17. Indeed, these DHHC proteins promote stable membrane attachment of CSP, which is otherwise cytosolic. An inverse correlation was identified between membrane affinity of unpalmitoylated CSP mutants and subsequent palmitoylation: mutants with an increased membrane affinity localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are physically separated from the Golgi-localized DHHC proteins. Palmitoylation of an ER-localized mutant could be rescued by brefeldin A treatment, which promotes the mixing of ER and Golgi membranes. Interestingly though, the palmitoylated mutant remained at the ER following brefeldin A washout and did not traffic to more distal membrane compartments. We propose that CSP has a weak membrane affinity that allows the protein to locate its partner Golgi-localized DHHC proteins directly by membrane ""sampling."" Mutations that enhance membrane association prevent sampling and lead to accumulation of CSP on cellular membranes such as the ER. The coupling of CSP palmitoylation to Golgi membranes may thus be an important requirement for subsequent sorting."
https://openalex.org/W2086966705,"There is accumulating evidence from immunological, pathological and therapeutic studies that B cells are key components in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS).In this prospective study we have for the first time investigated the differences in the inflammatory response between relapsing and progressive MS by comparing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell profiles from patients at the onset of the disease (clinically isolated syndrome, CIS), relapsing-remitting (RR) and chronic progressive (CP) MS by flow cytometry. As controls we have used patients with other neurological diseases. We have found a statistically significant accumulation of CSF mature B cells (CD19+CD138-) and plasma blasts (CD19+CD138+) in CIS and RRMS. Both B cell populations were, however, not significantly increased in CPMS. Further, this accumulation of B cells correlated with acute brain inflammation measured by magnetic resonance imaging and with inflammatory CSF parameters such as the number of CSF leukocytes, intrathecal immunoglobulin M and G synthesis and intrathecal production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and the B cell chemokine CxCL-13.Our data support an important role of CSF B cells in acute brain inflammation in CIS and RRMS."

A larger number of patients for study of dosage and efficacy are therefore needed. Methods and Principal Findings Two hundred forty two HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients were immunized with six injections of either 30 µg YIC, 60 µg of YIC or alum adjuvant as placebo at four-week intervals under code. HBV markers and HBV DNA were monitored during immunization and 24 weeks after the completion of immunization. The primary endpoint was defined as loss of HBeAg, or presence of anti-HBe antibody or suppression of HBV DNA, while the secondary endpoint was both HBeAg seroconversion and suppression of HBV DNA. Statistical significance was not reached in primary endpoints four weeks after the end of treatment among three groups, however, at the end of follow-up, HBeAg sero-conversion rate was 21.8%(17/78) and 9% (7/78) in the 60 µg YIC and placebo groups respectively (p = 0.03), with 95% confidence intervals at 1.5% to 24.1%. Using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) model, a significant difference of group effects was found between 60 µg YIC and the placebo groups in terms of the primary endpoint. Eleven serious adverse events occurred, which were 5.1%, 3.6%, and 5.0% in the placebo, 30 µg YIC and 60 µg YIC groups respectively (p>0.05). Conclusions Though statistical differences in the preset primary and secondary endpoints among the three groups were not reached, a late and promising HBeAg seroconversion effect was shown in the 60 µg YIC immunized regimen. By increasing the number of patients and injections, the therapeutic efficacy of YIC in chronic hepatitis B patients will be further evaluated. Trial Registration ChiCTR.org ChiCTR-TRC-00000022"
https://openalex.org/W2054563163,"IGF-1 has been shown to promote proliferation of normal epithelial breast cells, and the IGF pathway has also been linked to mammary carcinogenesis in animal models. We comprehensively examined the association between common genetic variation in the IGF1, IGFBP1, and IGFBP3 genes in relation to circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels and breast cancer risk within the NCI Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3). This analysis included 6,912 breast cancer cases and 8,891 matched controls (n = 6,410 for circulating IGF-I and 6,275 for circulating IGFBP-3 analyses) comprised primarily of Caucasian women drawn from six large cohorts. Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype patterns were characterized in the regions surrounding IGF1 and the genes coding for two of its binding proteins, IGFBP1 and IGFBP3. In total, thirty haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNP) were selected to provide high coverage of common haplotypes; the haplotype structure was defined across four haplotype blocks for IGF1 and three for IGFBP1 and IGFBP3. Specific IGF1 SNPs individually accounted for up to 5% change in circulating IGF-I levels and individual IGFBP3 SNPs were associated up to 12% change in circulating IGFBP-3 levels, but no associations were observed between these polymorphisms and breast cancer risk. Logistic regression analyses found no associations between breast cancer and any htSNPs or haplotypes in IGF1, IGFBP1, or IGFBP3. No effect modification was observed in analyses stratified by menopausal status, family history of breast cancer, body mass index, or postmenopausal hormone therapy, or for analyses stratified by stage at diagnosis or hormone receptor status. In summary, the impact of genetic variation in IGF1 and IGFBP3 on circulating IGF levels does not appear to substantially influence breast cancer risk substantially among primarily Caucasian postmenopausal women."
https://openalex.org/W2144851385,"A heated debate has recently emerged between tiger farmers and conservationists about the potential consequences of lifting the ban on trade in farmed tiger products in China. This debate has caused unfounded speculation about the extent of the potential market for tiger products. To fill this knowledge gap, we surveyed 1880 residents from a total of six Chinese cities to understand Urban Chinese tiger consumption behavior, knowledge of trade issues and attitudes towards tiger conservation. We found that 43% of respondents had consumed some product alleged to contain tiger parts. Within this user-group, 71% said that they preferred wild products over farmed ones. The two predominant products used were tiger bone plasters (38%) and tiger bone wine (6.4%). 88% of respondents knew that it was illegal to buy or sell tiger products, and 93% agreed that a ban in trade of tiger parts was necessary to conserve wild tigers. These results indicate that while Urban Chinese people are generally supportive of tiger conservation, there is a huge residual demand for tiger products that could resurge if the ban on trade in tiger parts is lifted in China. We suspect that the current supply of the market is predominantly met by fakes or substitutes branded as tiger medicines, but not listing tiger as an ingredient. We suggest that the Traditional Chinese Medicine community should consider re-branding these products as bone-healing medicines in order to reduce the residual demand for real tiger parts over the long-term. The lifting of the current ban on trade in farmed tiger parts may cause a surge in demand for wild tiger parts that consumers say are better. Because of the low input costs associated with poaching, wild-sourced parts would consistently undercut the prices of farmed tigers that could easily be laundered on a legal market. We therefore recommend that the Chinese authorities maintain the ban on trade in tiger parts, and work to improve the enforcement of the existing ban."
https://openalex.org/W2033434758,"Bacterial wilt is a common disease that causes severe yield and quality losses in many plants. In the present study, we used the model Ralstonia solanacearum-Arabidopsis thaliana pathosystem to study transcriptional changes associated with wilt disease development. Susceptible Col-5 plants and RRS1-R-containing resistant Nd-1 plants were root-inoculated with R. solanacearum strains harbouring or lacking the matching PopP2 avirulence gene. Gene expression was marginally affected in leaves during the early stages of infection. Major changes in transcript levels took place between 4 and 5 days after pathogen inoculation, at the onset of appearance of wilt symptoms. Up-regulated genes in diseased plants included ABA-, senescence- and basal resistance-associated genes. The influence of the plant genetic background on disease-associated gene expression is weak although some genes appeared to be specifically up-regulated in Nd-1 plants. Inactivation of some disease-associated genes led to alterations in the plant responses to a virulent strain of the pathogen. In contrast to other pathosystems, very little overlap in gene expression was detected between the early phases of the resistance response and the late stages of disease development. This observation may be explained by the fact that above-ground tissues were sampled for profiling whereas the bacteria were applied to root tissues. This exhaustive analysis of Arabidopsis genes whose expression is modulated during bacterial wilt development paves the way for dissecting plant networks activated by recognition of R. solanacearum effectors in susceptible plants."
https://openalex.org/W2148879975,"Globally, natural ecosystems are being lost to agricultural land at an unprecedented rate. This land-use often results in significant reductions in abundance and diversity of the flora and fauna as well as alterations in their composition. Despite this, there is little public perception of which taxa are most important in terms of their total biomass, biodiversity or the ecosystem services they perform. Such awareness is important for conservation, as without appreciation of their value and conservation status, species are unlikely to receive adequate conservation protection. We investigated children's perceptions of rainforest biodiversity by asking primary-age children, visiting the University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge to draw their ideal rainforest. By recording the frequency at which children drew different climatic, structural, vegetative and faunal components of the rainforest, we were able to quantify children's understanding of a rainforest environment. We investigated children's perceptions of rainforest biodiversity by comparing the relative numbers of the taxa drawn with the actual contributions made by these taxa to total rainforest biomass and global biodiversity. We found that children have a sophisticated view of the rainforest, incorporating many habitat features and a diverse range of animals. However, some taxa were over-represented (particularly mammals, birds and reptiles) and others under-represented (particularly insects and annelids) relative to their contribution to total biomass and species richness. Scientists and naturalists must continue to emphasise the diversity and functional importance of lesser-known taxa through public communication and outdoor events to aid invertebrate conservation and to ensure that future generations are inspired to become naturalists themselves."

We compared the 4-year prognostic value of combining FT-AT and viral load for a better definition of the inactive carrier status. Methods and Findings 1,300 consecutive CHB patients who had been prospectively followed since 2001 were pre-included. The main endpoint was the absence of liver-related complications, transplantation or death. We used the manufacturers' definitions of normal FT (< = 0.27), normal AT (< = 0.29) and 3 standard classes for viral load. The adjustment factors were age, sex, HBeAg, ethnic origin, alcohol consumption, HIV-Delta-HCV co-infections and treatment. Results 1,074 patients with baseline FT-AT and viral load were included: 41 years old, 47% African, 27% Asian, 26% Caucasian. At 4 years follow-up, 50 complications occurred (survival without complications 93.4%), 36 deaths occurred (survival 95.0%), including 27 related to HBV (survival 96.1%). The prognostic value of FT was higher than those of viral load or ALT when compared using area under the ROC curves [0.89 (95%CI 0.84–0.93) vs 0.64 (0.55–0.71) vs 0.53 (0.46–0.60) all P<0.001], survival curves and multivariate Cox model [regression coefficient 5.2 (3.5–6.9; P<0.001) vs 0.53 (0.15–0.92; P = 0.007) vs −0.001 (−0.003−0.000;P = 0.052)] respectively. A new definition of inactive carriers was proposed with an algorithm combining “zero” scores for FT-AT (F0 and A0) and viral load classes. This new algorithm provides a 100% negative predictive value for the prediction of liver related complications or death. Among the 275 patients with the classic definition of inactive carrier, 62 (23%) had fibrosis presumed with FT, and 3 died or had complications at 4 year. Conclusion In patients with chronic hepatitis B, a combination of FibroTest-ActiTest and viral load testing accurately defined the prognosis and the inactive carrier status."
https://openalex.org/W4240092169,"If we are to learn how to develop a healthy society, we must transform history into an analytical, predictive science, argues Peter Turchin. He has identified intriguing patterns across vastly different times and places. For much of human history we have plenty of facts. The job of historians is to select and arrange those facts to support a range of subjective interpretations. Peter Turchin thinks that at that rate, we are doomed to repeat our mistakes. Instead, he says, we need unifying theories. We should use the data to construct general explanations, and test them on all the data, not a subset chosen to make a point. To learn from history, first we must make it science."
https://openalex.org/W2084648002,"Background Fluorescent reporters are useful for assaying gene expression in living cells and for identifying and isolating pure cell populations from heterogeneous cultures, including embryonic stem (ES) cells. Multiple fluorophores and genetic selection markers exist; however, a system for creating reporter constructs that preserve the regulatory sequences near a gene's native ATG start site has not been widely available. Methodology Here, we describe a series of modular marker plasmids containing independent reporter, bacterial selection, and eukaryotic selection components, compatible with both Gateway recombination and lambda prophage bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) recombineering techniques. A 2A self-cleaving peptide links the reporter to the native open reading frame. We use an emerald GFP marker cassette to create a human BAC reporter and ES cell reporter line for the early cardiac marker NKX2-5. NKX2-5 expression was detected in differentiating mouse ES cells and ES cell-derived mice. Conclusions Our results describe a NKX2-5 ES cell reporter line for studying early events in cardiomyocyte formation. The results also demonstrate that our modular marker plasmids could be used for generating reporters from unmodified BACs, potentially as part of an ES cell reporter library."

We hypothesized that T-cell and antibody responses to the vaccines are functions of pre-existing host immunity against influenza antigens.During the 2004 and 2005 influenza seasons, we have collected data on cellular and humoral immune reactivity to influenza virus in blood samples collected before and after immunization with inactivated or live attenuated influenza vaccines in healthy children and adults. We first used cross-validated lasso regression on the 2004 dataset to identify a group of candidate baseline correlates with T-cell and antibody responses to vaccines, defined as fold-increase in influenza-specific T-cells and serum HAI titer after vaccination. The following baseline parameters were examined: percentages of influenza-reactive IFN-gamma(+) cells in T and NK cell subsets, percentages of influenza-specific memory B-cells, HAI titer, age, and type of vaccine. The candidate baseline correlates were then tested with the independent 2005 dataset. Baseline percentage of influenza-specific IFN-gamma(+) CD4 T-cells was identified as a significant correlate of CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, with lower baseline levels associated with larger T-cell responses. Baseline HAI titer and vaccine type were identified as significant correlates for HAI response, with lower baseline levels and the inactivated vaccine associated with larger HAI responses. Previously we reported that baseline levels of CD56(dim) NK reactivity against influenza virus inversely correlated with the immediate T-cell response to vaccination, and that NK reactivity induced by influenza virus depended on IL-2 produced by influenza-specific memory T-cells. Taken together these results suggest a novel mechanism for the homeostasis of virus-specific T-cells, which involves interaction between memory helper T-cells, CD56(dim) NK and DC.These results demonstrate that assessment of baseline biomarkers may predict immunologic outcome of influenza vaccination and may reveal some of the mechanisms responsible for variable immune responses following vaccination and natural infection."
https://openalex.org/W2011159058,"Background Phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a major serine-threonine protein phosphatase in eukaryotes, is an oligomeric protein comprised of structural (A) and catalytic (C) subunits to which a variable regulatory subunit (B) can associate. The C subunit contains a methyl ester post-translational modification on its C-terminal leucine residue, which is removed by a specific methylesterase (PME-1). Methylesterification is thought to control the binding of different B subunits to AC dimers, but little is known about its physiological significance in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we show that targeted disruption of the PME-1 gene causes perinatal lethality in mice, a phenotype that correlates with a virtually complete loss of the demethylated form of PP2A in the nervous system and peripheral tissues. Interestingly, PP2A catalytic activity over a peptide substrate was dramatically reduced in PME-1(−/−) tissues, which also displayed alterations in phosphoproteome content. Conclusions These findings suggest a role for the demethylated form of PP2A in maintenance of enzyme function and phosphorylation networks in vivo."

Moreover, ceramide has been shown to accumulate in mitochondria upon induction of apoptotic processes. In this study, we sought to evaluate the effects of natural, highly hydrophobic long-chain ceramides on mitochondrial function in vitro. Ceramide in a dodecane/ethanol delivery system inhibited the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) induced by either oxidative stress, SH group cross-linking, or high Ca2+ load, suggesting that the inhibitory point is at a level at which major PTP regulatory pathways converge. Moreover, ceramide had no effect on well known mitochondrial components that modulate PTP activity, such as cyclophilin D, voltage-dependent anion channel, adenine nucleotide transporter, and ATP synthase. The inhibitory effect of ceramide on PTP was not stereospecific, nor was there a preference for ceramide over dihydroceramide. However, the effect of ceramide on PTP was significantly influenced by the fatty acid moiety chain length. These studies are the first to show that long-chain ceramide can influence PTP at physiologically relevant concentrations, suggesting that it is the only known potent natural inhibitor of PTP.

In recent years, ceramide has become increasingly appreciated as a bioactive lipid that modulates apoptotic/necrotic cellular processes that are integrated at the mitochondrial level, as a result of studies demonstrating correlation between the intensity of cell death stimuli and the level of ceramide production (1Taha T.A.

One mechanism assumes selective permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane for proapoptotic proteins as a process independent of inner membrane functions. The second mechanism presumes that loss of the permeability barrier of the inner mitochondrial membrane is a prerequisite for the subsequent outer membrane permeabilization. The simplest model of selective outer membrane permeabilization arises from experiments with artificial membranes (liposomes and black lipid membranes) (5Montes L.R. Ruiz-Arguello M.B. Goni F.M.

In fact it was recently shown that Bcl-2 can disassemble ceramide channels in the outer mitochondrial membrane (21Siskind L.J. Feinstein L. Yu T. Davis J.S. Jones D. Choi J. Zuckerman J.E. Tan W.

An increase in proapoptotic proteins bound to mitochondria is thought to trigger specific permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane for cytochrome c and other mitochondrial intermembrane-resident apoptosis-inducing proteins (31Armstrong J.S.

A mechanism that accounts for participation of the inner mitochondrial membrane in the release of proapoptotic proteins involves the obligatory opening of the permeability transition pore in the inner membrane (PTP) 2The abbreviations used are:PTPpermeability transition poreΔΨmitochondrial inner membrane potentialCSAcyclosporine ACRCmitochondrial calcium retention capacityERendoplasmic reticulumMSmass spectrometryPhAsOphenylarsine oxidet-BuOOHt-butyl-hydroperoxideTPP+tetraphenylphosphonium. 2The abbreviations used are:PTPpermeability transition poreΔΨmitochondrial inner membrane potentialCSAcyclosporine ACRCmitochondrial calcium retention capacityERendoplasmic reticulumMSmass spectrometryPhAsOphenylarsine oxidet-BuOOHt-butyl-hydroperoxideTPP+tetraphenylphosphonium.

The resulting osmotic swelling of the mitochondrial inner membrane compartment leads to rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane and release of proapoptotic proteins. It is thought that PTP opening occurs as a result of direct interaction of ceramide with the pore in the presence of Ca2+ (15Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 35Pacher P. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4107-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) or that PTP opening follows mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. In the latter scenario, the source of Ca2+ is the Ca2+ stores of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which are considered primary ceramide targets (20Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H.

Moreover, overexpression of cyclophilin D delays apoptosis induced by mild oxidative stress and staurosporine (56Lin D.T. Lechleiter J.D. J. Biol.

At the same time, cyclophilin D deficiency was protective under high intensity oxidative stress and high Ca2+ overload, conditions that precipitate necrosis. These data seem to rule out a critical role for PTP in both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways but suggest that PTP opening is instrumental in necrosis. These studies raised questions about the extrapolation of results obtained with artificial short-chain ceramide analogs to in vivo studies and whether long- and short-chain ceramides affect the same binding sites on mitochondria with similar consequences. To address this question, we reinvestigated the effect of ceramides on the permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane using natural long-chain ceramides delivered in dodecane/ethanol. This system had been successfully utilized for ceramide delivery to subcellular organelles in situ (41Paris F. Grassme H. Cremesti A. Zager J. Fong Y. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Gulbins E.

Our results show that long-chain but not short-chain ceramides suppress PTP activity at physiologically relevant concentrations. These studies raise the interesting possibility that long-chain ceramides promote apoptosis at the level of the mitochondria by causing PTP closure. Materials—Ceramides were from the Lipidomics Core of the Medical University of South Carolina; α-chymotrypsin (bovine pancreas) and cyclosporin A were from Calbiochem. All other reagents were from Sigma. Preparation of Mitochondria from Rat Liver—Liver mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation as described (60Graham J.M. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 3.3.1-3.3.3Google Scholar, 61Frezza C. Cipolat S. Scorrano L. Nat. Protocols. 2007; 2: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, mitochondria were prepared from livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats (220–250 g) fasted overnight. Livers from two rats were homogenized in 100 ml of isolation medium containing 230 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted by KOH). Homogenate was centrifuged at 579 × gmax for 10 min to pellet the nucleus and unbroken cells. Supernatant from the previous step was centrifuged at 8,000 × gmax for 10 min to pellet mitochondria. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in isolation medium and centrifuged at 8,000 × gmax for 10 min. This step was repeated again, except that isolation medium contained 10 μm of EGTA instead of EDTA. The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in the above medium (final protein concentration 60 mg/ml). Where indicated, further mitochondrial purification was performed by self-generated Percoll gradient centrifugation (62Hoppel C.L. Kerner J. Turkaly P. Turkaly J. Tandler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23495-23503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined with a bicinchoninic acid assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (63Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (17635) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Incubation Medium—Unless otherwise specified, incubations of isolated mitochondria were conducted at 25 °C, using 1 mg/ml of protein in a medium containing 150 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted by KOH), 5 mm succinate, 3 mm KH2PO4, and rotenone (2 μm). Deviations from this medium and other reagents employed are described in the figure legends. Mitochondrial membrane potential and swelling were followed simultaneously in a water-jacketed cell equipped with magnetic stirring. Ceramide Delivery—Ceramides were delivered in ethanol or in 2% dodecane solution in ethanol. In all experiments, ceramides were delivered as a 5-μl aliquot per 1 ml of incubation medium to maintain dodecane 0.01% (0.6 mm) and ethanol at 0.5% (0.1 m). The ceramide solution was warmed to 37 °C and introduced into the medium immediately after adding mitochondria. Mitochondrial Respiration—Oxygen consumption by mitochondria was measured in a chamber equipped with a Clark type oxygen electrode (Instech Laboratories) at the conditions described under “Mitochondrial Incubation Medium.” Measurement of Mitochondrial Permeabilization—Inner membrane permeabilization was assayed by measurements of ΔΨ and mitochondrial swelling. ΔΨ as estimated from the accumulation of TPP+ in the mitochondrial matrix as described by Kamo et al. (64Kamo N. Muratsuga M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TPP+ (2 μm) was added to the incubation medium as indicated in the figure legends. Mitochondrial swelling was measured by changes in absorbance at 520 nm using a Brinkmann PC 900 probe colorimeter and a fiberoptic probe. Calcium Retention Capacity (CRC) of Mitochondria—CRC was evaluated according to previously published methods (65Soriano M.E. Nicolosi L. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36803-36808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes-Tris, 5 mm succinate-Tris, 1 mm Pi-Tris, 10 μm EGTA-Tris, and 2 μm rotenone (pH 7.4) by gradual addition to mitochondria (1 mg/ml at 25 °C) of known amounts of Ca2+. The concentration of Ca2+ in the incubation medium was followed with a Ca2+-selective electrode (Orion). Cytochrome c Release from Mitochondria—Aliquots of mitochondrial suspension were taken as indicated in the figure legends and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 3 min. The supernatants and mitochondria were frozen and stored at -80 °C. Cytochrome c in supernatants and mitochondria was quantified using the Quantikine cytochrome c ELISA kit (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Quantification was performed in duplicates according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Measurement of Mitochondrial Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans Isomerase (Cyclophilin D) Activity—Mitochondria (200 μg/ml), untreated or treated with 5 μm C18-ceramide or 5 μm cyclosporin A at 25 °C for 15 min, were permeabilized for 5 min with alamethicin (7 μg/ml) and kept at 10 °C before the analysis. Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity was assayed at 10 °C as described by Halestrap and Davidson (66Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Equal volumes of mitochondrial suspension and medium containing 0.52 mg/ml chymotrypsin were mixed, and the reading at A390 was allowed to stabilize for 2 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (final concentration, 25 μm) from 25 mm stock dissolved in trifluoroethanol/LiCl (470 mm) (67Garcia-Echeverria C. Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P. Rich D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Ceramide Measurements—Mitochondrial ceramide species were determined by tandem mass spectrometry (MS) (68Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Hannun Y.A. Bielawska A. Methods. 2006; 39: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were incubated at 25 °C, using protein (1 mg/ml) in a medium containing 150 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted by KOH), 5 mm succinate, 3 mm KH2PO4, and rotenone (2 μm). The incubations were performed in the absence or in the presence of C18-ceramide (1 nmol/mg protein). After 3 min, aliquots of mitochondrial suspension were taken and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 3 min. Mitochondrial pellets were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, for electrospray ionization/MS/MS analysis of ceramides, which was performed on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, operating in a multiple reaction-monitoring, positive ionization mode. Mitochondrial lysates, fortified with internal standards, were extracted with ethyl acetate/isopropyl alcohol/water (60:30:10, v/v/v), evaporated to dryness, and reconstituted in 100 μl of methanol. The samples were injected into the HP1100/TSQ 7000 liquid chromatography/MS system and gradient-eluted from the BDS Hypersil C8, 150 × 3.2-mm, 3-μm particle size column, with a 1.0 mm methanolic ammonium formate, 2 mm aqueous ammonium formate mobile phase system. The peaks for the target analytes and internal standards were collected and processed with the Xcalibur software system. Calibration curves were constructed by plotting peak area ratios of synthetic standards, representing each target analyte, to the corresponding internal standard. The target analyte peak area ratios from the samples were similarly normalized to their respective internal standard and compared with the calibration curves using a linear regression model. Statistical Analysis—The standard curve and the data for cytochrome c release were computed by generation of a four-parameter logistic curve fit. Where indicated, values were expressed as the mean value of the treatment groups ± S.D. Data were analyzed for statistically significant differences between groups using the two-tailed Student's t test. Statistical significance was ascribed to the data when p was <0.05. C18-ceramide Suppresses Ca2+-induced Permeability Transition and Increases Mitochondrial CRC—To determine whether natural long chain ceramide modulates the PTP, we used a dodecane/ethanol delivery system, which promotes the incorporation of long-chain ceramide into subcellular compartments (41Paris F. Grassme H. Cremesti A. Zager J. Fong Y. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Gulbins E. Kolesnick R. J. Biol.

Acta. 2002; 1583: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Induction of permeability transition under conditions relevant to ischemia/reperfusion (presence of a large amount of Ca2+ and inorganic phosphate) was nearly completely suppressed by 1 nmol/mg protein C18-ceramide (Fig. 1). A 3-min preincubation with C18-ceramide resulted in 74% (736.4 ± 12.4 pmol/mg protein from 1 nmol added) incorporation into mitochondria as measured by MS. C18-ceramide prevented both the Ca2+-induced decline in ΔΨ (Fig. 1A, trace 2 versus trace 3) and large amplitude"
https://openalex.org/W2036165466,"Background Polyploidy is a prominent feature of many human cancers, and it has long been hypothesized that polyploidy may contribute to tumorigenesis by promoting genomic instability. In this study, we investigated whether polyploidy per se induced by a relevant oncogene can promote genomic instability and tumorigenicity in human epithelial cells. Principal Findings When the oncogenic serine-threonine kinase Pim-1 is overexpressed in immortalized, non-tumorigenic human prostate and mammary epithelial cells, these cells gradually converted to polyploidy and became tumorigenic. To assess the contribution of polyploidy to tumorigenicity, we obtained sorted, matched populations of diploid and polyploid cells expressing equivalent levels of the Pim-1 protein. Spectral karyotyping revealed evidence of emerging numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities in polyploid cells, supporting the proposition that polyploidy promotes chromosomal instability. Polyploid cells displayed an intact p53/p21 pathway, indicating that the viability of polyploid cells in this system is not dependent on the inactivation of the p53 signaling pathway. Remarkably, only the sorted polyploid cells were tumorigenic in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions Our results support the notion that polyploidy can promote chromosomal instability and the initiation of tumorigenesis in human epithelial cells."

To facilitate HIV testing procedures, the San Francisco General Hospital Medical Center eliminated required written patient consent for HIV testing in its medical settings in May 2006. To describe the change in HIV testing rates in different hospital settings and populations after the change in HIV testing policy in the SFDH medical center, we performed an observational study using interrupted time series analysis.Data from all patients aged 18 years and older seen from January 2003 through June 2007 at the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) medical care system were included in the analysis. The monthly HIV testing rate per 1000 had patient-visits was calculated for the overall population and stratified by hospital setting, age, sex, race/ethnicity, homelessness status, insurance status and primary language.By June 2007, the average monthly rate of HIV tests per 1000 patient-visits increased 4.38 (CI, 2.17-6.60, p<0.001) over the number predicted if the policy change had not occurred (representing a 44% increase). The monthly average number of new positive HIV tests increased from 8.9 (CI, 6.3-11.5) to 14.9 (CI, 10.6-19.2, p<0.001), representing a 67% increase. Although increases in HIV testing were seen in all populations, populations at highest risk for HIV infection, particularly men, the homeless, and the uninsured experienced the highest increases in monthly HIV testing rates after the policy change.The elimination of the requirement for written consent in May 2006 was associated with a significant and sustained increase in HIV testing rates and HIV case detection in the SFDPH medical center. Populations facing the higher barriers to HIV testing had the highest increases in HIV testing rates and case detection in response to the policy change."
https://openalex.org/W2017664295,"Functional annotation of protein sequences with low similarity to well characterized protein sequences is a major challenge of computational biology in the post genomic era. The cyclin protein family is once such important family of proteins which consists of sequences with low sequence similarity making discovery of novel cyclins and establishing orthologous relationships amongst the cyclins, a difficult task. The currently identified cyclin motifs and cyclin associated domains do not represent all of the identified and characterized cyclin sequences. We describe a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier, CyclinPred, which can predict cyclin sequences with high efficiency. The SVM classifier was trained with features of selected cyclin and non cyclin protein sequences. The training features of the protein sequences include amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, secondary structure composition and PSI-BLAST generated Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) profiles. Results obtained from Leave-One-Out cross validation or jackknife test, self consistency and holdout tests prove that the SVM classifier trained with features of PSSM profile was more accurate than the classifiers based on either of the other features alone or hybrids of these features. A cyclin prediction server--CyclinPred has been setup based on SVM model trained with PSSM profiles. CyclinPred prediction results prove that the method may be used as a cyclin prediction tool, complementing conventional cyclin prediction methods."
https://openalex.org/W2073450661,"Background GBV-C infection is associated with prolonged survival in HIV-infected people and GBV-C inhibits HIV replication in co-infection models. Expression of the GBV-C nonstructural phosphoprotein 5A (NS5A) decreases surface levels of the HIV co-receptor CXCR4, induces the release of SDF-1 and inhibits HIV replication in Jurkat CD4+ T cell lines. Methodology/Principal Findings Jurkat cell lines stably expressing NS5A protein and peptides were generated and HIV replication in these cell lines assessed. HIV replication was significantly inhibited in all cell lines expressing NS5A amino acids 152–165. Substitution of an either alanine or glycine for the serine at position 158 (S158A or S158G) resulted in a significant decrease in the HIV inhibitory effect. In contrast, substituting a phosphomimetic amino acid (glutamic acid; S158E) inhibited HIV as well as the parent peptide. HIV inhibition was associated with lower levels of surface expression of the HIV co-receptor CXCR4 and increased release of the CXCR4 ligand, SDF-1 compared to control cells. Incubation of CD4+ T cell lines with synthetic peptides containing amino acids 152–167 or the S158E mutant peptide prior to HIV infection resulted in HIV replication inhibition compared to control peptides. Conclusions/Significance Expression of GBV-C NS5A amino acids 152–165 are sufficient to inhibit HIV replication in vitro, and the serine at position 158 appears important for this effect through either phosphorylation or structural changes in this peptide. The addition of synthetic peptides containing 152–167 or the S158E substitution to Jurkat cells resulted in HIV replication inhibition in vitro. These data suggest that GBV-C peptides or a peptide mimetic may offer a novel, cellular-based approach to antiretroviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2030910172,"Xanthomonas campestris GumK (β-1,2-glucuronosyltransferase) is a 44-kDa membrane-associated protein that is involved in the biosynthesis of xanthan, an exopolysaccharide crucial for this bacterium's phytopathogenicity. Xanthan also has many important industrial applications. The GumK enzyme is the founding member of the glycosyltransferase family 70 of carbohydrate-active enzymes, which is composed of bacterial glycosyltransferases involved in exopolysaccharide synthesis. No x-ray structures have been reported for this family. To better understand the mechanism of action of the bacterial glycosyltransferases in this family, the x-ray crystal structure of apo-GumK was solved at 1.9Å resolution. The enzyme has two well defined Rossmann domains with a catalytic cleft between them, which is a typical feature of the glycosyltransferase B superfamily. Additionally, the crystal structure of GumK complexed with UDP was solved at 2.28Å resolution. We identified a number of catalytically important residues, including Asp157, which serves as the general base in the transfer reaction. Residues Met231, Met273, Glu272, Tyr292, Met306, Lys307, and Gln310 interact with UDP, and mutation of these residues affected protein activity both in vitro and in vivo. The biological and structural data reported here shed light on the molecular basis for donor and acceptor selectivity in this glycosyltransferase family.

These results also provide a rationale to obtain new polysaccharides by varying residues in the conserved α/β/α structural motif of GumK. Glycosylation events are among the most common and important enzymatic reactions in nature. Glycosyltransferases (GTs) 5The abbreviations used are:GTglycosyltransferaseMan-Cel-P-P-lipidmannose-α-1,3-glucose-β-1,4-glucose-diphosphate-polyisoprenylr.m.s.root mean square. are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a sugar moiety from a donor to an acceptor molecule. At present, there are more than 40,000 known or putative GT sequences in various data bases (1Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). In the CAZy (carbohydrate-active enzyme) data base (available on the World Wide Web), GTs are grouped into 90 families on the basis of sequence similarity. This impressive dispersion is due to very low sequence homology among GTs. Despite this vast sequence divergence and poor homology, the reported structures of 60 GTs in 27 families have only two folds, corresponding to superfamilies GT-A and GT-B. Other predicted folds, such as GT-C for transmembrane GTs (2Liu J. Mushegian A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1418-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 3Rosen M.L. Edman M. Sjostrom M. Wieslander A. J. Biol.

GT-A and -B folds are variations of Rossmann-like β/α/β domains. The GT-A members display a central sheet of 7-8 β-strands, with a DXD motif. This acidic motif coordinates the ribose and metal (divalent cation) in the catalytic center. The presence of this motif has been shown to be crucial for the catalytic activity in these GTs (4Breton C. Snajdrova L. Jeanneau C. Koca J. Imberty A. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 29R-37RCrossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In contrast, GT-B proteins do not bind metals and have two well defined Rossmann domains with a deep cleft between them, in which binding of substrates and catalytic activity occur (5Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 6Hu Y. Walker S. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1287-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of GTs is that very similar functions can be carried out by multiple sequences, which exhibit very similar folding. This situation complicates the determination of specific contacts and amino acids that affect or are directly involved in catalysis, substrate binding, and other structural functions. GTs are involved in the biosynthesis of glycolipids, polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and a vast range of metabolites. Accordingly, GTs display a wide array of acceptor molecules, including oligosaccharides, lipids, proteins, and glycolipids (4Breton C. Snajdrova L. Jeanneau C. Koca J. Imberty A. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 29R-37RCrossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 7Bowles D. Isayenkova J. Lim E.K. Poppenberger B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In contrast, donor substrates are mostly activated glyconucleotides. The numerous compounds that are synthesized by GTs have central roles in cellular biochemistry (e.g. in cell signaling, immune response, and bacterial virulence, among other processes) (8Doores K.J. Gamblin D.P. Davis B.G. Chemistry. 2006; 12: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 9Feizi T. Mulloy B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 602-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, these compounds have an enormous potential for practical applications. The chemoenzymatic synthesis of oligo/polysaccharides promises an almost infinite variety of new carbohydrate structures with as yet unknown applications (10Faijes M. Planas A. Carbohydr. Res. 2007; 342: 1581-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 11Watts A.G. Withers S.G. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: e9-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In particular, extracellular polysaccharides have a role in bacterial virulence but also may display rheological/physical properties that would be useful for industrial applications. Such is the case for xanthan, an exopolysaccharide produced by the phytopathogen Xanthomonas campestris. Xanthan is involved in X. campestris virulence toward a substantial number of economically and agriculturally important plants (12He Y.Q. Zhang L. Jiang B.L. Zhang Z.C. Xu R.Q. Tang D.J. Qin J. Jiang W. Zhang X. Liao J. Cao J.R. Zhang S.S. Wei M.L. Liang X.X. Lu G.T. Feng J.X. Chen B. Cheng J. Tang J.L. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R218Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Also, this polysaccharide has a wide range of potential applications and functions (13Becker A. Katzen F. Puhler A. Ielpi L. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 50: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). X. campestris GumK (β-1,2 glucuronosyltransferase), a membrane-associated protein that is part of the biosynthetic machinery for xanthan, is responsible specifically for the addition of a GlcA residue from UDP-GlcA during the formation of the pentasaccharidic subunit of xanthan (Fig. 1) (14Barreras M. Abdian P.L. Ielpi L. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Katzen F. Ferreiro D.U. Oddo C.G. Ielmini M.V. Becker A. Puhler A. Ielpi L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1607-1617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the synthetic utility and industrial/medical importance of GTs, many details of enzyme structures and mechanisms remain elusive. In particular, no structural information is available on xanthan-specific GTs, and not much is known about the GTs involved in the synthesis of other polysaccharides (16Berg S. Kaur D. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 35R-56RCrossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 17Hancock S.M. Vaughan M.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2006; 10: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This is due to the fact that GTs are difficult to characterize because the proteins are often membrane-associated, unstable, present at very low concentrations, and difficult to express. Herein we describe the structure of GumK in the presence and absence of UDP. We focused on the molecular contacts that anchor the donor molecule to the protein, including kinetic analyses of mutant proteins and the in vivo effects of these mutations on X. campestris polysaccharide production. Also, we mutated residues that could be directly involved in the catalytic mechanism of GumK. Determination of the catalytic mechanism and of the specific contacts with substrates could result in strategies for the exploitation of GTs as unique synthetic catalysts in the creation of unnatural polysaccharide variants. Protein Purification and Crystallization—GumK protein with a C-terminal LEHHHHHH tag was expressed from plasmid pETHisKC and purified as described previously (14Barreras M. Abdian P.L. Ielpi L. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Purified protein was concentrated to 20 mg/ml in storage buffer (400 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) by ultrafiltration. The protein concentrate was stored at 4 °C until use. Crystals of the native and D157A mutated form of GumK were grown at 20 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, as described previously (18Barreras M. Bianchet M.A. Ielpi L. Acta Crystallograph. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2006; 62: 880-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). For the UDP-GumK or UDP-GumK D157A complexes, crystals of GumK were soaked for 0.5-8 h in crystallization solution plus UDP-GlcA (10 or 100 mm) at 20 °C. Unfortunately, GlcA was readily hydrolyzed from UDP-GlcA during these soaking experiments in the native form of GumK, and we could only see the position of UDP bound to GumK. Furthermore, we were unable to co-crystallize GumK or mutant D157A in the presence of UDP-GlcA. Data Collection and Phasing—Heavy atom soaks were carried out in crystallization buffer (35% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.2 m Li2SO4, 0.1 m CsCl, pH 8.2) supplemented with 10 mm K2PtCl4 for 2 h. Single crystals of native and platinum derivative GumK were drawn out of the crystallization drop and frozen in liquid nitrogen. All data sets were collected at 110 K. Crystallization buffer was used as the cryoprotectant. A two-wavelength MAD data set (peak = 1.0718 Å and inflection = 1.0722 Å) was collected to 2.0 Å resolution from a platinum derivative in beamline X12C, National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratories (Brookhaven, NY) in an ADSC Q210 modified detector. Reflection intensities were integrated using MOSFLM, merged with SCALA, and reduced with Truncate (19Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19793) Google Scholar). Statistics are shown in Table 1. The crystal belonged to space group P6522, in which an asymmetric unit comprised one GumK molecule. Platinum sites were found by using SHELX, and the positions, B-factors, and occupancies were refined by using Sharp (20Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 215-230Google Scholar), with the four platinum positions identified after six rounds of refinement and inspection of log likelihood gradient residual Fourier maps. Density modification was performed by using DM, and solvent flattening was performed by using Solomon (19Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19793) Google Scholar). This processing resulted in a readily interpretable map of electronic density.TABLE 1X-ray data collection and refinement statistics for wild type GumKSoaking conditionPlatinum-labeled GumK 2 h, 10 mmNativeUDP 2 h, 100 mmData collectionBeam lineNSLS, X12CNSLS, X12CLNLS, DO3B-MX1Space groupP6522Unit cell (Å)a = 123.6; b = 123.6; c = 174.3a = 123.6; b = 123.6; c = 174.3a = 121.2; b = 121.2; c = 170.7Unit cell (degrees)α = 90.0; β = 90.0; γ = 120.0α = 90.0; β = 90.0; γ = 120.0α = 90.0; β = 90.0; γ = 120.0Platinum-labeled GumKNativeUDPPeakInflectionWavelength (Å)1.07181.0722Resolution range (Å)33.15-2.0 (2.1-2.0)33.33-2.0 (2.1-2.0)104.8-1.9 (2.00 -1.90)27.0-2.28 (2.4-2.28)No. of observations (F > 0)879,956343,756Unique reflections51,44151,63562,43533,916Completeness (%)95.5 (75.1)95.5 (74.8)100.098.5Anomalous completeness (%)91.8 (63.9)92.1 (74.8)Average I/σ(I)17.3 (2.8)17.4 (2.8)30.0 (8.2)19.6 (6.4)Rmerge (%)6.9 (34.4)10.4 (30.3)RefinementResolution104.8-1.927-2.28Used reflections59,20432,197Rwork, Rfree (95%/5%)0.180/0.2040.175/0.216No. of atomsProtein2,9622,932Ligand/ion24Water474420Average B-factors18.6021.08Protein18.0119.60Ligand/ion22.85Water30.0130.87r.m.s. deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0130.017Bond angles (degrees)1.2771.682Ramachandran plot (% residues)In most favored regions91.091.9In additional allowed regions8.38.1In generously allowed regions0.60.0 Open table in a new tab Single UDP-GlcA-soaked crystals (native and D157A mutated forms) were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Complete data sets of the GumK-UDP complex were collected in beamline DO3B-MX1, Laboratorio Nacional de Luz Sincrotron (Campinas, Brazil), at a wavelength of 1.427 Å. Statistics are shown in Table 1. Model Building, Refinement, and Validation—Model building of the native GumK was performed with ARP/wARP. Refinement was carried out with Refmac. For nondefined regions, manual building was performed with Coot (21Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23578) Google Scholar) alternated with Refmac. At the beginning of analysis, a fraction of the data sets (5%) was set aside for Rfree calculations. To determine the structure of the GumK-UDP complex, ARP/wARP using the native GumK as a model was used, iterated with Refmac refinement. For nondefined regions, manual building was performed with Coot. Surface electrostatic potentials were calculated using the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) program (22Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5897) Google Scholar) and visualized with Pymol (DeLano Scientific LLC) (available on the World Wide Web). Determination of Kinetic Parameters—The kinetic parameters of the enzymes were measured with a radioactive assay. The natural GumK lipid acceptor is mannose-α-1,3-glucose-β-1,4-glucose-diphosphate-polyisoprenyl (Man-Cel-P-P-lipid). This acceptor was obtained from X. campestris membranes as follows. Ten-liter cultures of X. campestris were grown in SFFM medium (4 mm K2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 7.5 mm (NH4)2SO4, 5 μm MnCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.125% (w/v) tryptone, 0.125% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.125% (w/v) malt extract, 0.005% (w/v) FeSO4-7H20). These cultures were allowed to reach an A600 of 3.0, and at that point bacterial cells were collected and permeabilized as described (23Ielpi L. Couso R.O. Dankert M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2490-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These EDTA-permeabilized cells were used in scaled up incubations with 3 mm UDP-Glc and 1.5 mm GDP-[14C]Man (specific activity 1 mCi/mol) in the presence of incubation buffer (75 mm MgCl2, 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.2) for 1 h. These incubations produced the natural acceptor (Man-Cel-P-P-lipid) as the only radioactive product species (14Barreras M. Abdian P.L. Ielpi L. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Soluble compounds were removed by three washes with deionized water, and Man-Cel-P-P-lipid was recovered by three extractions with 1:1 chloroform/methanol. The apparent Km for the donor substrate, UDP-GlcA, was determined at a fixed concentration of the acceptor Man-Cel-P-P-lipid (500 μm) because of the limited supply of this substrate. The Km for the acceptor was determined at UDP-[14C]GlcA concentrations (specific activity 30 Ci/mol) estimated to be at least 10 times greater than the Km. Incubations were performed at 20 °C for 2 min in 100-μl volume reactions with 2% Triton X-100. After the incubation, the radioactive glycolipid product was recovered by organic solvent extraction as described (14Barreras M. Abdian P.L. Ielpi L. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in triplicate. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced into the cloned gumK gene by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the appropriate primers. Mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. The mutated gumK genes were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously for GumK (14Barreras M. Abdian P.L. Ielpi L. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Purified mutated proteins were stored at 4 °C until use. For in vivo complementation assays, the open reading frames of mutated GumK were cloned in the wide host range plasmid pBBRprom (14Barreras M. Abdian P.L. Ielpi L. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Plasmids were denoted pBBRSK for the pBBRprom derivative expressing wild-type GumK and pBBRSK/mutation (e.g. pBBRSK/D157A) for pBBRprom derivatives expressing mutated GumK. Protein expression in complemented strains was verified with Western blotting using polyclonal antibodies raised against GumK. Complementation Assays and Polysaccharide Quantification—X. campestris FC2 (wild type) and XcK (gumK- isogenic mutant) strains (15Katzen F. Ferreiro D.U. Oddo C.G. Ielmini M.V. Becker A. Puhler A. Ielpi L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1607-1617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carrying plasmid pBBRSK or pBBRSK/mutation were inoculated and incubated for 72 h in SFFM medium plus 4% glucose with the corresponding antibiotics. Xanthan was precipitated by the cetylpyridinium chloride polysaccharide precipitation method (24Scott J.E. Whistler R.L. General Polysaccharides. V. Academic Press, Inc., New York1965: 38-44Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 20 μl of culture supernatants containing xanthan or xanthan standard aqueous solutions of 0.75, 1.5, 2.25, 3, or 3.75% were mixed with 3 ml of deionized water. Three milliliters of 0.36% cetylpyridinium chloride solution was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. This mixture was centrifuged at 5,000 × g to pellet the cetylpyridinium chloride/xanthan precipitate. The absorbance at 260 nm to measure the remaining cetylpyridinium chloride in the supernatant of the xanthan standards was used to construct a calibration curve. The amount of polysaccharide produced in the samples was estimated from the A260 by reference to the calibration curve. The amount of polysaccharide produced was measured at least three times. Structures of GumK and of the GumK-UDP Complex—X. campestris GumK is the founding member of family GT70 (see the CAZy data base on the World Wide Web), which is composed of phytopathogenic bacterial glucuronosyltransferases involved in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis. The x-ray structure of GumK was solved with a two-wavelength MAD experiment (Table 1). There was only one protein molecule in the asymmetric unit. The final 1.9-Å structure included residues 13-385 and 480 water molecules (Protein Data Bank code 2HY7). The final native GumK structure had a crystallographic R value of 0.18 and an Rfree of 0.20. The GumK-UDP complex was solved at 2.28 Å resolution by MR, using the native structure as a model. The Rfree was 0.216 for the final structure (Protein Data Bank code 2Q6V). Fig. 2 shows that GumK is a two-domain molecule with an overall size of ∼50 × 50 × 65 Å. The N-domain is formed by residues 13-201 and the final C-terminal α-helix, Cα7 (residues 362-380), a feature observed in other GT-B enzymes (25Wrabl J.O. Grishin N.V. J. Mol.

This domain is composed of 10 α-helices surrounding a core of eight mostly parallel β-sheets (Fig. 2, A and B). The C-domain is composed of residues 210-361, which consists of a core of six β-sheets shielded by six α-helices. The β-strands and α-helices of both domains are ordered as in a typical Rossmann fold (29Baker P.J. Britton K.L. Rice D.W. Rob A. Stillman T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and exhibit high structural homology (r.m.s. deviation = 2.02 over 88 C-α), which confirms that despite the low sequence homology between these domains, the same fold is adopted. The N- and C-domains are joined by a linker (residues 202-208) between the eighth β-strand and the first α-helix of the C-domain. This interdomain linker, together with the loop connecting Cα6 and Cα7 (residues 353-361), defines the floor of the cleft between the two domains. The cleft is ∼20 Å deep and 15 Å across at its widest point. The dimensions of the cleft suggest that the enzyme crystallized in an “inactive,” open state. Recently, it was shown that a large relative rotation between the N- and C-domains is necessary for catalytic activity in GT-B MshA (30Vetting M.W. Frantom P.A. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15834-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This interdomain flexibility has also been observed or predicted for other members of the GT-B superfamily (26Buschiazzo A. Ugalde J.E. Guerin M.E. Shepard W. Ugalde R.A. Alzari P.M.

These motions of 10-25° are believed to convert the enzyme to an “active,” closed conformation, bringing critical residues from the N- and C-terminal domains together into a catalytically active conformation. We will study whether this type of movement is required for GumK activity. Fig. 3 shows the position of UDP in its binding pocket. This pocket is located on the C-terminal face of the cleft, in a positively charged surface. The UDP-binding pocket is an α/β/α motif defined by Cα3, Cβ4, and Cα4 and the linkers between them (Figs. 2B and 3D). This structural motif is highly conserved throughout the GT-B superfamily (6Hu Y. Walker S. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1287-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34Davies G.J. Gloster T.M. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) as an alternative way to coordinate the negative charge of the phosphates in the nucleotide-sugar. Regardless of the low sequence homology, the degree of structural conservation with other GT-B superfamily members was evident upon calculation of the structural homology of the C-terminal globular domain. The GumK-UDP structure exhibited marked superposition with family 5 glycogen synthase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Protein Data Bank code 1rzu; r.m.s. deviation = 3.8 Å) and with family 4 lipopolysaccharide core biosynthesis α-1,3-glucosyltransferase (Protein Data Bank code 2iv7; r.m.s. deviation = 3.3 Å) (26Buschiazzo A.

The most notable contacts of GumK-UDP include hydrogen bonds between the imidic NH of Met231 and α-phosphates O1 and O2 and between the imidic NH of Met306 and the β-phosphate O1. The phosphates are also coordinated by hydrogen bonding between Lys307 NH2 and β-phosphates O2 and O3 and between Tyr292 OH and O1β and O2β (Fig. 3C). Mutation of Lys307 and Tyr292 had marked effects on both the Km of UDP-GlcA and the Vmax (Table 2), indicating the importance of these contacts in the interaction with the negatively charged phosphates of the donor molecule. The ribose is bound by hydrogen bonds between its 2′- and 3′-hydroxyls and Q310 NH2. The Q310A mutation substantially increased the Kmof UDP-GlcA, despite having a minor effect on the Vmax. Finally, the uridine is bound by contacts between O4′ and the imidic NH of E272 and between the carbonilic CO of Met273 and N3′.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters for wild-type and mutant GumKMutantKm UDPGlcAVmaxKm aceptorVmaxKcatμMpmol/μg minμMpmol/μg minmin−1Wild type62 ± 5116 ± 3198 ± 16115 ± 35.2M231A63 ± 9116 ± 4218 ± 16119 ± 35.2E272A125 ± 1050 ± 1291 ± 2152 ± 1.22.3E272D100 ± 495 ± 1267 ± 1399 ± 1.54.3Y292A210 ± 2527 ± 1274 ± 3023.5 ± 11.2K307A440 ± 3415.2 ± 0.2390 ± 6510.8 ± 0.60.68Q310A1,190 ± 9999 ± 2246 ± 2098 ± 2.54.5D157A/E/NNDaND, not detected, because of no or very low level activity (<0.5 pmol/μg/min).NDE192A61 ± 6115 ± 3199 ± 20118 ± 3.55.2D207A60 ± 6111 ± 3194 ± 18115 ± 35.05D234A63 ± 9117 ± 4205 ± 18120 ± 35.3a ND, not detected, because of no or very low level activity (<0.5 pmol/μg/min). Open table in a new tab The hydrogen bonds and atoms involved in UDP binding are detailed in Table 3. All of these interactions seem to have a cooperative effect on the binding of UDP. Mutations Y292A and K307A have marked effects on the Km of UDP-GlcA and on the catalytic efficiency (kcat), whereas other mutations, such as E272A and E272D, had smaller effects on the Km and kcat (Table 2). Despite the influences of some contacts on the efficiency of the enzyme, individual contacts proved to be relevant but not essential for binding the substrate. Interestingly, Lys307, the contact that had the most pronounced effect on the kcat of GumK, is located in the conserved Cα4 helix and is one of the residues that coordinate the phosphates (Table 3 and Fig. 4).TABLE 3Hydrogen bonds between UDP and GumK residuesGumK residuesHydrogen bond distance of UDPÅMet231/Nα-Phosphate O1A (2.92)Met231/Nα-Phosphate O2A (2.85)Tyr292/OHβ-Phosphate O1B (2.65)Tyr292/OHβ-Phosphate O2B (2.42)Met306/Nβ-Phosphate O1B (3.06)Lys307/Nβ-Phosphate O2B (2.35)Lys307/Nβ-Phosphate O3B (2.51)Gln310/NE2Ribose O3″ (2.50)Gln310/NE2Ribose O2″ (2.88)Met273/NUracil O4′ (2.66)Met273/OUracil N3′ (2.71)Glu272/OE1Uracil O4′ (3.36) Open table in a new tab Fig. 3, C and D, shows the restrictions to which the donor substrate is exposed while entering the binding pocket. From the architecture of the α/β/α UDP-binding motif, it is clear that any purine-based nucleotide would not be able to fit in the narrow pocket created by the Cα3 and Cα4 helices, specifically because of the hydrogen bonding between Glu272 and Met273 and the uridine. All residues that contact the UDP are conserved in the GT70 family (Fig. 4), which indicates that, as expected, binding of the donor substrate is conserved. For biotechnological applications, a relaxed or even a changed specificity could be very useful for the synthesis of novel polysaccharides. We speculate that a change in the specificity of GumK is possible by mutation of residues in the conserved Cα4 helix, where some of the most important contacts for binding the donor molecule are located. Proposed Membrane Association Site—Subcellular localization experiments showed that GumK associates with the cell membrane in X. campestris (14Barreras M. Abdian P.L. Ielpi L. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2062918278,"Background The Rel/NF-κB transcription factors are often activated in solid or hematological malignancies. In most cases, NF-κB activation is found in malignant cells and results from activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway, leading to RelA and/or c-Rel activation. Recently, NF-κB activity in inflammatory cells infiltrating solid tumors has been shown to contribute to solid tumor initiation and progression. Noncanonical NF-κB activation, which leads to RelB activation, has also been reported in breast carcinoma, prostate cancer, and lymphoid leukemia. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report a novel role for RelB in stromal cells that promote T-cell leukemogenesis. RelB deficiency delayed leukemia onset in the TEL-JAK2 transgenic mouse model of human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Bone marrow chimeric mouse experiments showed that RelB is not required in the hematopoietic compartment. In contrast, RelB plays a role in radio-resistant stromal cells to accelerate leukemia onset and increase disease severity. Conclusions/Significance The present results are the first to uncover a role for RelB in the crosstalk between non-hematopoietic stromal cells and leukemic cells. Thus, besides its previously reported role intrinsic to specific cancer cells, the noncanonical NF-κB pathway may also play a pro-oncogenic role in cancer microenvironmental cells."
https://openalex.org/W2020807365,"Background Polarity establishment and maintenance are crucial for morphogenesis and development. In budding yeast, these two intricate processes involve the superposition of regulatory loops between polarity landmarks, RHO GTPases, actin-mediated vesicles transport and endocytosis. Deciphering the chronology and the significance of each molecular step of polarized growth is therefore very challenging. Principal Findings We have taken advantage of the fact that yeast quiescent cells display actin bodies, a non polarized actin structure, to evaluate the role of F-actin in bud emergence. Here we show that upon exit from quiescence, actin cables are not required for the first steps of polarized growth. We further show that polarized growth can occur in the absence of actin patch-mediated endocytosis. We finally establish, using latrunculin-A, that the first steps of polarized growth do not require any F-actin containing structures. Yet, these structures are required for the formation of a bona fide daughter cell and cell cycle completion. We propose that upon exit from quiescence in the absence of F-actin, secretory vesicles randomly reach the plasma membrane but preferentially dock and fuse where polarity cues are localized, this being sufficient to trigger polarized growth."

https://openalex.org/W2007196785,"Psychophysical studies suggest that humans preferentially use a narrow band of low spatial frequencies for face recognition. Here we asked whether artificial face recognition systems have an improved recognition performance at the same spatial frequencies as humans. To this end, we estimated recognition performance over a large database of face images by computing three discriminability measures: Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis, Non-Parametric Discriminant Analysis, and Mutual Information. In order to address frequency dependence, discriminabilities were measured as a function of (filtered) image size. All three measures revealed a maximum at the same image sizes, where the spatial frequency content corresponds to the psychophysical found frequencies. Our results therefore support the notion that the critical band of spatial frequencies for face recognition in humans and machines follows from inherent properties of face images, and that the use of these frequencies is associated with optimal face recognition performance."
https://openalex.org/W2099703287,"α-Dystrobrevin is a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and is thought to have both structural and signaling roles in skeletal muscle. Mice deficient for α-dystrobrevin (adbn−/−) exhibit extensive myofiber degeneration and neuromuscular junction abnormalities. However, the biochemical stability of the DGC and the functional performance of adbn−/− muscle have not been characterized. Here we show that the biochemical association between dystrophin and β-dystroglycan is compromised in adbn−/− skeletal muscle, suggesting that α-dystrobrevin plays a structural role in stabilizing the DGC. However, despite muscle cell death and DGC destabilization, costamere organization and physiological performance is normal in adbn−/− skeletal muscle. Our results demonstrate that myofiber degeneration alone does not cause functional deficits and suggests that more complex pathological factors contribute to the development of muscle weakness in muscular dystrophy."
