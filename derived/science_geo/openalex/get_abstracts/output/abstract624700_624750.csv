However, it remains controversial whether MHC-II is solely responsible for the inhibitory function of LAG-3. Here, we demonstrate that fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1), a liver-secreted protein, is a major LAG-3 functional ligand independent from MHC-II. FGL1 inhibits antigen-specific T cell activation, and ablation of FGL1 in mice promotes T cell immunity. Blockade of the FGL1-LAG-3 interaction by monoclonal antibodies stimulates tumor immunity and is therapeutic against established mouse tumors in a receptor-ligand inter-dependent manner. FGL1 is highly produced by human cancer cells, and elevated FGL1 in the plasma of cancer patients is associated with a poor prognosis and resistance to anti-PD-1/B7-H1 therapy. Our findings reveal an immune evasion mechanism and have implications for the design of cancer immunotherapy.

Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3, CD223) is a transmembrane protein primarily found on activated T cells (Anderson et al., 2016Anderson A.C. Joller N. Kuchroo V.K.

LAG-3 protein consists of four extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (D1–D4) with high homology to CD4 (Triebel et al., 1990Triebel F. Jitsukawa S. Baixeras E. Roman-Roman S. Genevee C.

Currently, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block the interaction of LAG-3 with its canonical ligand, MHC-II, are being evaluated for their antitumor activity in clinical trials (Anderson et al., 2016Anderson A.C.

Characterization of the lymphocyte activation gene 3-encoded protein. A new ligand for human leukocyte antigen class II antigens.J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar showed an interaction between MHC-II and LAG-3 via a cell-cell adhesion assay, which was further extended by studies indicating LAG-3 fusion protein binding to MHC-II+ B cell lines (Huard et al., 1995Huard B. Prigent P. Tournier M. Bruniquel D. Triebel F. CD4/major histocompatibility complex class II interaction analyzed with CD4- and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3)-Ig fusion proteins.Eur. J.

T cell major histocompatibility complex class II molecules down-regulate CD4+ T cell clone responses following LAG-3 binding.Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1180-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, there is a lack of direct evidence for the protein-protein interaction between LAG-3 and MHC-II. MHC-II was proposed to interact with LAG-3 through the residues on the membrane-distal, top face of the LAG-3 D1 domain (Huard et al., 1997Huard B. Mastrangeli R. Prigent P. Bruniquel D. Donini S. El-Tayar N. Maigret B. Dréano M. Triebel F. Characterization of the major histocompatibility complex class II binding site on LAG-3 protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 5744-5749Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Functionally, the MHC-II-CD4 interaction supported helper T cell activation, while overexpression of LAG-3 downregulated antigen-dependent CD4+ T cell responses in vitro (Workman and Vignali, 2003Workman C.J. Vignali D.A. The CD4-related molecule, LAG-3 (CD223), regulates the expansion of activated T cells.Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 970-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, several mAbs that do not block the binding of LAG-3 to MHC-II nonetheless promoted T cell functions. For example, C9B7W, a specific mAb against the murine LAG-3 D2 domain, enhanced the proliferation and effector functions of T cells in vitro and in vivo (Workman et al., 2002bWorkman C.J. Rice D.S. Dugger K.J. Kurschner C. Vignali D.A. Phenotypic analysis of the murine CD4-related glycoprotein, CD223 (LAG-3).Eur. J.

Negative regulation of T cell homeostasis by lymphocyte activation gene-3 (CD223).J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This antibody also increased the accumulation and effector function of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in several tumor models (Grosso et al., 2007Grosso J.F. Kelleher C.C. Harris T.J. Maris C.H. Hipkiss E.L. De Marzo A. Anders R. Netto G. Getnet D. Bruno T.C. et al.LAG-3 regulates CD8+ T cell accumulation and effector function in murine self- and tumor-tolerance systems.J. Clin.

The effects of C9B7W mAb on T cells are largely similar, if not identical, to those produced by LAG-3 genetic deficiency (Woo et al., 2012Woo S.R. Turnis M.E. Goldberg M.V. Bankoti J. Selby M. Nirschl C.J. Bettini M.L. Gravano D.M. Vogel P. Liu C.L. et al.Immune inhibitory molecules LAG-3 and PD-1 synergistically regulate T-cell function to promote tumoral immune escape.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar, Workman and Vignali, 2005Workman C.J. Vignali D.A. Negative regulation of T cell homeostasis by lymphocyte activation gene-3 (CD223).J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A recent study also showed that anti-LAG-3 mAb that do not block MHC-II binding could still stimulate T cell activation and anti-tumor activity (Cemerski et al., 2015Cemerski S. Zhao S. Chenard M. Laskey J. Cui L. Shukla R. et al.T cell activation and anti-tumor efficacy of anti-LAG-3 antibodies is independent of LAG-3 – MHCII blocking capacity.J. Immunother. Cancer. 2015; 3: 183Crossref Google Scholar). Given that LAG-3 also suppresses the function of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, which do not interact with MHC-II (Anderson et al., 2016Anderson A.C. Joller N. Kuchroo V.K. Lag-3, Tim-3, and TIGIT: co-inhibitory receptors with specialized functions in immune regulation.Immunity. 2016; 44: 989-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar), these studies raise the possibility that the immunological functions of LAG-3 might be mediated via an unknown ligand. Here, we report that fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) is a major functional ligand of LAG-3. FGL1 belongs to the fibrinogen family with high amino acid homology to the carboxyl terminus of the fibrinogen beta- and gamma-subunits, but it does not have the characteristic platelet-binding site, cross-linking region, and thrombin-sensitive site necessary for fibrin clot formation (Yamamoto et al., 1993Yamamoto T. Gotoh M. Sasaki H. Terada M. Kitajima M. Hirohashi S. Molecular cloning and initial characterization of a novel fibrinogen-related gene, HFREP-1.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Under normal physiological conditions, FGL1 protein is primarily secreted from hepatocytes and contributes to its mitogenic and metabolic functions (Demchev et al., 2013Demchev V. Malana G.

The immunological function of FGL1, however, remains unknown. Our results demonstrate that FGL1 is a major inhibitory ligand for LAG-3, revealing a new mechanism of immune evasion. We employed our genome-scale receptor array (GSRA) technology to search for LAG-3 binding protein(s) using an immunoglobulin (Ig) Fc-tagged LAG-3extracellular domain fusion protein (LAG-3-Ig) (Figure 1A). The GSRA is a semi-automatic gene expression and detection system for rapidly identifying protein-protein interactions, which has been modified from our previous report (Yao et al., 2011Yao S. Zhu Y. Zhu G. Augustine M. Zheng L. Goode D.J. Broadwater M. Ruff W. Flies S. Xu H. et al.B7-h2 is a costimulatory ligand for CD28 in human.Immunity. 2011; 34: 729-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In this updated system, individual human cDNA encoding transmembrane and secreted proteins (upon addition of a transmembrane domain) were overexpressed on the surface of 293T cells. Several adaptor genes were also expressed in 293T (293T.2A cells) to facilitate protein expression on the cell surface (Figure 1A). An Ig-tagged protein of interest can then be screened for interaction(s) using the GSRA system in a high throughput fashion by the mix-and-read laser scanning macro-confocal fluorescent plate reader. The current version of the GSRA contains over 90% of annotated genes encoding human transmembrane (∼5,600) and secreted (∼1,000) proteins (Table S1). FGL1 was identified as a major binding protein for LAG-3-Ig in the GSRA system (Figures 1B and S1A). The FGL1-LAG-3 interaction is conserved across species in both human and mouse (Figure 1B). This interaction was further validated by flow cytometry, as indicated by a linear association between FGL1-Ig and anti-LAG-3 staining on LAG-3+ cells (Figure 1C). The FGL1-LAG-3 interaction was shown to have a Kd value of ∼1.5 nM by Octet bio-layer interferometry analysis (Figure 1D). Using an SEC650 size exclusion column, the purified recombinant FLAG-tagged FGL1 (FLAG-FGL1) showed an oligomeric state (peak 1-2) and a dimeric peak (peak 3) (Figure S1B), which was validated via size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering analysis (SEC-MALS, data not shown). We observed stronger binding of the oligomeric forms of FLAG-FGL1 (peak 1-2) than the dimeric form (peak 3) to immobilized LAG-3-Ig in the Octet analysis (Figure S1C). In addition, the slow disassociation rate hints at a stable interaction between FGL1 and LAG-3 in both human and mouse (Figures 1D and S1D). FGL2, a homolog of FGL1 previously implicated in Treg functions (Shevach, 2009Shevach E.M. Mechanisms of foxp3+ T regulatory cell-mediated suppression.Immunity. 2009; 30: 636-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar), as well as other fibrinogen domain-containing family members such as angiopoietin-related proteins, did not bind LAG-3 (Figure 1B and data not shown), indicating that the FGL1-LAG-3interaction is highly specific.Figure S1Characterization of the FGL1-LAG-3 Interaction, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Schematic representation of the FGL1 constructs with an artificial transmembrane domain (FGL1-TM).

FGL1 is composed of a coil-coil domain (CCD) and a fibrinogen-like domain (FD) (Yamamoto et al., 1993Yamamoto T. Gotoh M. Sasaki H. Terada M. Kitajima M. Hirohashi S. Molecular cloning and initial characterization of a novel fibrinogen-related gene, HFREP-1.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Through domain deletion studies, we demonstrated that the FD, but not CCD, is responsible for LAG-3 binding (Figure S1E). The LAG-3 protein consists of four Ig-like extracellular domains, D1–D4 (Huard et al., 1997Huard B. Mastrangeli R. Prigent P. Bruniquel D. Donini S. El-Tayar N. Maigret B. Dréano M. Triebel F.

LAG-3, a novel lymphocyte activation gene closely related to CD4.J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1393-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) (Figure 1E, left). The deletion of the D3–D4 domain in LAG-3 did not affect FGL1 binding, while either D1 or D2 alone partially decreased the binding (Figure 1E, right), suggesting that both D1 and D2 contribute to the FGL1-LAG-3 interaction. A single point mutation (Y73F) in the C′ strand of LAG-3 D1 domain was previously shown to disrupt MHC-II binding (Huard et al., 1997Huard B. Mastrangeli R. Prigent P. Bruniquel D. Donini S. El-Tayar N. Maigret B. Dréano M. Triebel F. Characterization of the major histocompatibility complex class II binding site on LAG-3 protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, this mutation did not affect FGL1-Ig binding (Figure 1E, right), indicating that the FGL1-LAG-3 interaction is non-redundant with MHC-II-LAG-3 binding. Furthermore, pre-incubation of LAG-3+ 293T cells with C9B7W, an anti- LAG-3 mAb that binds the LAG-3 D2 domain without blocking the FGL1-MHC-II interaction (Andrews et al., 2017Andrews L.P.

Finally, LAG-3+ cells stained with MHC-II (I-Ab) fusion protein did not show a significant decrease in binding even in the presence of a 100-fold excess of FGL1-Ig (Figure S1F). Taken together, our results indicate that FGL1 interacts with LAG-3 in an MHC-II-independent manner, and this interaction involves the FGL1 fibrinogen-like domain and the LAG-3 D1–D2 domain. LAG-3 is not found on resting T cells other than a subset of Tregs but can be upregulated under various antigen stimulation conditions (Baixeras et al., 1992Baixeras E. Huard B. Miossec C.

https://openalex.org/W2905891236,"There are still gaps in our understanding of the complex processes by which p53 suppresses tumorigenesis. Here we describe a novel role for p53 in suppressing the mevalonate pathway, which is responsible for biosynthesis of cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenoids. p53 blocks activation of SREBP-2, the master transcriptional regulator of this pathway, by transcriptionally inducing the ABCA1 cholesterol transporter gene. A mouse model of liver cancer reveals that downregulation of mevalonate pathway gene expression by p53 occurs in premalignant hepatocytes, when p53 is needed to actively suppress tumorigenesis. Furthermore, pharmacological or RNAi inhibition of the mevalonate pathway restricts the development of murine hepatocellular carcinomas driven by p53 loss. Like p53 loss, ablation of ABCA1 promotes murine liver tumorigenesis and is associated with increased SREBP-2 maturation. Our findings demonstrate that repression of the mevalonate pathway is a crucial component of p53-mediated liver tumor suppression and outline the mechanism by which this occurs."

Thus, Perturb-ATAC is a powerful strategy to dissect gene regulatory networks in development and disease. Gene expression in eukaryotic organisms is regulated by the interplay of thousands of trans-acting regulatory factors and millions of cis-acting DNA elements (Kundaje et al., 2015Kundaje A. Meuleman W. Ernst J. Bilenky M. Yen A. Heravi-Moussavi A. Kheradpour P. Zhang Z. Wang J. Ziller M.J. et al.Roadmap Epigenomics ConsortiumIntegrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes.Nature. 2015; 518: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (3614) Google Scholar). However, it is challenging to characterize each trans-factor or cis-element because epigenetic assays require large amounts of cellular material and are difficult to couple with genetic perturbations at scale. Therefore, most studies are limited to measuring how single genetic perturbations affect chromatin state in bulk cell populations. We recently developed the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq), which utilizes a hyperactive transposase (Tn5) to measure the activity of regulatory DNA elements (Buenrostro et al., 2013Buenrostro J.D.

Additionally, single-cell ATAC-seq profiles can be paired with orthogonal measurements of RNA or protein expression in the same cell (Satpathy et al., 2018Satpathy A.T. Saligrama N. Buenrostro J.D.

Similar advances in the ability to measure transcriptomes in single cells have recently allowed high-throughput genetic screens coupled with simultaneous transcriptome phenotyping (Dixit et al., 2016Dixit A.

Methods. 2017; 14: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). We further develop this concept of high-content genetic screening by measuring the effects of CRISPR perturbations on the epigenome. This method, termed perturbation-indexed single-cell ATAC-seq (Perturb-ATAC), measures CRISPR single guide RNA (sgRNA) sequences and ATAC-seq profiles in single cells. We performed Perturb-ATAC in 2,936 immortalized B lymphoblasts and 1,356 primary human keratinocytes, encompassing 63 genotype-phenotype relationships. Analysis of a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen in GM12878 lymphoblasts identified trans-factor control of several layers of epigenetic regulation. Single-cell ATAC-seq in primary human epidermal cells identified three regulatory modules in keratinocyte differentiation, and a Perturb-ATAC CRISPR-deletion screen revealed key transcription factor (TF) regulators of each module. We mapped epistatic relationships between TFs using multiplexed perturbations and suggest that genomic co-localization and co-expression of TFs may predict genetic interaction. Perturb-ATAC is a tool for studying relationships between factors that control chromatin states using high-throughput, high-complexity single-cell screens. In the Perturb-ATAC protocol, cells are first captured on the integrated fluidics circuit (IFC; Fluidigm) in single-cell chambers and subjected to lysis and DNA transposition with the Tn5 enzyme (Figure 1A). After transposition, Tn5 is released from open chromatin fragments, and CRISPR sgRNAs or sgRNA-identifying barcodes from each cell are reverse-transcribed using target-specific primers. All chamber contents are then amplified by PCR. Single-cell libraries are then collected, and sgRNA or ATAC amplicons are further amplified separately with cell-identifying barcoded primers, pooled, and sequenced. We first adapted a CRISPRi sgRNA vector to perform a simple mixing experiment with three populations of sgRNA-targeted cells (Adamson et al., 2016Adamson B. Norman T.M. Jost M. Cho M.Y. Nuñez J.K. Chen Y. Villalta J.E. Gilbert L.A.

We generated a sgRNA vector with unique 22- bp guide barcodes (GBCs) that corresponded to the identity of sgRNAs encoded by each vector (Figures 1A and S1A; Table S1). Using this vector, we targeted immortalized B lymphoblasts stably expressing dCas9-Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) with either non-human genome-targeting (NT) sgRNAs (NT1 or NT2) or sgRNAs targeting the promoter of the TF SPI1 (also known as PU.1), which is required for B cell development (Scott et al., 1994Scott E.W.

We then pooled cells and performed Perturb-ATAC on 309 single cells to assess the fidelity of pairing GBC detection with measurement of the epigenome. To eliminate the likelihood of recombination of sgRNAs and GBCs between vectors, as described recently(Adamson et al., 2018Adamson B. Norman T.M. Jost M. Weissman J.S.

Frequent sgRNA-barcode recombination in single-cell perturbation assays.PLoS ONE. 2018; 13: e0198635Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we performed packaging steps in separate cultures. Transduced cells were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) purification of mCherry+ cells and identified the sgRNA identity of each cell by amplifying the GBC (Figure 1A). We used stringent cutoffs to assign the presence or absence of a GBC (Figure S1B). First, we counted reads for each possible GBC in every cell and adjusted for sequencing depth (Figures S1B and S1C). Next, we set a minimum cutoff of 1,000 GBC reads per cell and removed cells with a high percentage of background reads (STAR Methods). As expected, reads were almost exclusively assigned to one GBC (NT1, NT2, or SPI1); multiple GBCs were only detected in 9 of 309 cells. These results demonstrate that Perturb-ATAC consistently detects GBCs with high confidence and a low false positive rate (Figures 1B, S1B, and S1C). Next, we evaluated the quality of ATAC-seq reads; high-quality single-cell ATAC-seq profiles were obtained in 79.2% of cells in which GBCs were also detected (Figure 1C). Cells passing filtering yielded an average of 11.33 × 103 fragments mapping to the nuclear genome, and approximately 43.05% of reads were within bulk ATAC-seq peaks, similar to previously published single-cell ATAC-seq as well as high-quality bulk ATAC-seq datasets (Buenrostro et al., 2015Buenrostro J.D. Wu B. Litzenburger U.M. Ruff D. Gonzales M.L. Snyder M.P. Chang H.Y. Greenleaf W.J.

Wu B. et al.An improved ATAC-seq protocol reduces background and enables interrogation of frozen tissues.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 959-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar; Figure 1C). Single-cell ATAC-seq reads recapitulated the characteristics of bulk ATAC-seq data, including insert size periodicity and fragment enrichment at transcription start sites (Figure 1D). These results indicate that GBC detection does not interfere with the generation of ATAC-seq libraries in single cells. Finally, we asked whether GBC-expressing cells exhibited the expected ATAC-seq phenotype. We first examined the promoter of SPI1, where SPI1-targeted sgRNAs were expected to recruit dCas9-KRAB. In cells expressing SPI1 sgRNAs, we observed a loss of accessibility at the promoter compared with cells expressing NT sgRNAs (Figure 1E). More broadly, SPI1-targeted cells exhibited similar changes in accessibility across all peaks that were changed in bulk ATAC-seq experiments (Figure 1F). We then measured global TF activity by determining the relative accessibility of all SPI1 motif-containing sites (51,862 sites). We found that SPI1 sites exhibited a significant loss of accessibility in SPI1-targeted cells compared with NT cells (false discovery rate [FDR] < 1e−3, permutation test; STAR Methods), similar to bulk SPI1-targeting experiments (Figure 1G). Altogether, these findings demonstrate that Perturb-ATAC simultaneously measures GBC sequences and ATAC-seq data in single cells with high fidelity. We next performed an expanded Perturb-ATAC screen to compare how broadly expressed and lineage-specific trans-factors shape the chromatin landscape of B lymphoblasts. We generated 40 sgRNA genotypes in 2,627 single cells, derived from single or dual targeting of the promoters of 12 trans-factors and 2 NT control sgRNAs (Table S2). The 12 targeted trans-factors included TFs (EBF1, IRF8, NFKB1, RELA, and SPI1), chromatin modifiers (BRG1, DNMT3A, EZH2, and TET2), and noncoding RNAs (7SK, EBER1, and EBER2) that have been shown previously to affect normal and neoplastic B cell development and function (Nutt and Kee, 2007Nutt S.L.

CRISPRi guide RNAs were designed to maximize knockdown efficiency and minimize off-target effects (Figures S2A–S2C; Table S1). We distinguished cells receiving either one or two GBCs, as described above (Figures 2A and 2B ). High-quality ATAC-seq profiles were obtained in 85.3% of cells in which GBCs were also detected. Cells passing filtering yielded an average of 10.68 × 103 fragments mapping to the nuclear genome, and approximately 43.85% of reads were within peaks present in bulk profiles (Figure 2C). Rare ATAC-seq reads mapping to the viral construct did not appear to influence ATAC-seq profiles, and observed accessibility at potential sgRNA mismatch loci indicated no evidence of off-target repression (STAR Methods; Figure S2D). Cells processed across several microfluidic chips exhibited no noticeable chip bias in ATAC-seq signal (Figure S2E).Figure 2Perturb-ATAC Screen for Control of Accessibility Landscape by Transcription Factors, Long Noncoding RNAs, and Chromatin RegulatorsShow full caption(A) Histogram of total GBC reads per cell.(B) Histogram of the second most common GBC identified in each cell.

Depletion of EZH2, a catalytic subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which deposits repressive Histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) chromatin marks, significantly increased accessibility at regions marked with H3K27me3 (chromVAR accessibility gain, 0.78; FDR < 0.0001; Figure 2E). Similarly, the most significant change in TF motif accessibility in SPI1-targeted cells was at SPI1-motif-containing regions (chromVAR accessibility loss, 2.17; FDR < 0.0001; Figure 2E). In contrast, SPI depletion increased the accessibility of IRF motif regions, demonstrating that SPI1 exhibits activating and repressive functions, as reported previously (van Riel and Rosenbauer, 2014van Riel B. Rosenbauer F. Epigenetic control of hematopoiesis: the PU.1 chromatin connection.Biol. Chem. 2014; 395: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Other altered TF motifs in SPI1-targeted cells included BCL11A, SPIB, and MEF2C factors, consistent with the function of SPI1 in regulating factors required for B cell lineage commitment (Figure 2E; Table S3; Su et al., 1996Su G.H.

Finally, targeting of the noncoding RNA (ncRNA) EBER2 identified 90 significantly altered features, including regions containing the PAX5 motif, a factor that physically interacts with EBER2 to control gene expression (Lee et al., 2015Lee N.

These results demonstrate that Perturb-ATAC identifies epigenomic phenotypes associated with perturbations of diverse categories of trans-factors. An analysis of ATAC-seq profiles derived from 40 single- and double-GBC genotypes (including NT controls) revealed accessibility changes in 10,103 open chromatin sites (mean, 404; range, 0–2,250 sites; per genotype) and 833 features (mean, 23; range, 0–110 features; per genotype; Figures 2F and S3A–S3C; Table S3). We clustered feature accessibility across all perturbations and found three sub-clusters of trans-factors with correlated effects (Figure 2F). Cluster 1 included the B cell lineage-determining TFs IRF8 and RELA and the chromatin regulators BRG1 and DNMT3A, suggesting that these factors may cooperate to establish the B cell chromatin landscape (Corces et al., 2016Corces M.R.

Interestingly, two nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) subunits, NFKB1 and RELA, showed overlapping and distinct effects, in line with prior studies demonstrating differences in the binding patterns of NF-κB subunits through the formation of distinct protein complexes (Figures 2F and S3B; Zhao et al., 2014Zhao B.

Consistent with reports of its repressor activity, IRF8 depletion increased accessibility at IRF sites (Tamura et al., 2008Tamura T. Yanai H. Savitsky D. Taniguchi T. The IRF family transcription factors in immunity and oncogenesis.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 535-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Cluster 2 included the ncRNA 7SK, which represses enhancer transcription (Flynn et al., 2016Flynn R.A. Do B.T. Rubin A.J. Calo E. Lee B. Kuchelmeister H. Rale M. Chu C. Kool E.T. Wysocka J. et al.7SK-BAF axis controls pervasive transcription at enhancers.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the chromatin remodeler EZH2 (Figure 2F). Cluster 3 included the highly homologous ncRNAs EBER1 and EBER2 as well as TET2 and EBF1. Cells depleted of EBER1 or EBER2 exhibited similar ATAC-seq profiles, highlighting their functional similarity (r = 0.714, p = 2.25e−85; Figures 2F and S3B; Arrand et al., 1989Arrand J.R. Young L.S.

EB virus-encoded RNAs are recognized by RIG-I and activate signaling to induce type I IFN.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and loss of either factor altered accessibility at EBF1 sites, consistent with these factors acting in the same pathway (Figure S3B). Finally, we used the diversity in ATAC-seq fragment sizes to infer the occupancy and positioning of nucleosomes in each perturbation condition (Schep et al., 2015Schep A.N. Buenrostro J.D. Denny S.K. Schwartz K. Sherlock G. Greenleaf W.J. Structured nucleosome fingerprints enable high-resolution mapping of chromatin architecture within regulatory regions.Genome Res. 2015; 25: 1757-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar; Figure S3D; STAR Methods). To validate this approach, we examined the profiles of sub-nucleosome-sized and nucleosome-sized fragments surrounding CTCF binding sites (Figure S3E). As expected, sub-nucleosome fragments were enriched at the CTCF motif, indicating a central nucleosome-free region. In contrast, nucleosome-sized fragments were enriched upstream and downstream relative to the CTCF motif, representing the +1 and −1 nucleosomes (Vierstra et al., 2014Vierstra J. Rynes E. Sandstrom R. Zhang M. Canfield T. Hansen R.S. Stehling-Sun S. Sabo P.J. Byron R. Humbert R. et al.Mouse regulatory DNA landscapes reveal global principles of cis-regulatory evolution.Science. 2014; 346: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We quantified a score representing the flanking accumulation and central depletion of nucleosome-sized ATAC-seq fragments in each perturbation (Figure 2G). At regions exhibiting an altered ATAC-seq signal, we compared this score between control and perturbed cells. Although some factors operated in the context of stable nucleosomes, others altered local nucleosome profiles. Depletion of either NFKB1 or RELA resulted in a stable nucleosome structure surrounding regions that gained accessibility, suggesting that these factors influence the binding of co-factors in an independently established nucleosome-free region (Figure S3F). However, regions that gained accessibility in DNMT3A-depleted cells exhibited a stronger central nucleosome, consistent with a model in which DMNT3A recruits negative regulatory factors to an open chromatin region. Reflecting another distinct mechanism, regions losing accessibility upon depletion of 7SK exhibited a stronger central nucleosome structure in 7SK-depleted cells, possibly indicating that 7SK interacts with nucleosome remodeling factors, as shown for the BAF complex (Figure S3F; Flynn et al., 2016Flynn R.A.

We performed a genome-wide analysis of copy number variants (CNVs) in 2,824 cases and 21,498 controls. Affected individuals carried a significant burden of rare exonic (that is, affecting coding regions) CNVs and were enriched for known genomic disorders (GD). Kidney anomaly (KA) cases were most enriched for exonic CNVs, encompassing GD-CNVs and novel deletions; obstructive uropathy (OU) had a lower CNV burden and an intermediate prevalence of GD-CNVs; and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) had the fewest GD-CNVs but was enriched for novel exonic CNVs, particularly duplications. Six loci (1q21, 4p16.1-p16.3, 16p11.2, 16p13.11, 17q12 and 22q11.2) accounted for 65% of patients with GD-CNVs. Deletions at 17q12, 4p16.1-p16.3 and 22q11.2 were specific for KA; the 16p11.2 locus showed extensive pleiotropy. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we identified TBX6 as a driver for the CAKUT subphenotypes in the 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome."

This idea, combined with the widespread use of population recordings, has prompted deep interest in how variability is distributed over a population (Cohen and Kohn, 2011Cohen M.R. Kohn A.

Further, the synthesis of diverse population datasets paints a picture in which low-dimensional shared variability is a signature of cognitive state, such as overall arousal, task engagement, and attention (Doiron et al., 2016Doiron B.

Cohen M.R. Learning and attention reveal a general relationship between population activity and behavior.Science. 2018; 359: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Such low-dimensional dynamics portend a theory for the genesis and modulation of shared population variability in recurrent cortical networks. Theories of cortical variability can be broadly separated into two categories: ones in which variability is internally generated through recurrent network interactions and ones in which variability originates external to the network. Networks of spiking neuron models where strong excitation is balanced by opposing recurrent inhibition produce high single-neuron variability through internal mechanisms (Shadlen and Newsome, 1998Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T. The variable discharge of cortical neurons: implications for connectivity, computation, and information coding.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3870-3896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996van Vreeswijk C. Sompolinsky H.

Model of global spontaneous activity and local structured activity during delay periods in the cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1997; 7: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). However, these networks famously enforce an asynchronous state and as such fail to explain population-wide shared variability (Renart et al., 2010Renart A. de la Rocha J. Bartho P. Hollender L. Parga N. Reyes A. Harris K.D. The asynchronous state in cortical circuits.Science. 2010; 327: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). This lack of success is contrasted with the ease of producing arbitrary correlation structure from external sources. Indeed, many past cortical models assume a global fluctuation from an external source and accurately capture the structure of population data (Doiron et al., 2016Doiron B. Litwin-Kumar A.

However, these phenomenological models begin with an assumption of low-dimensional variability from an unobserved source to explain the variability in a recorded population. In this way, these models are somewhat circular, begging the question of what are the mechanisms underlying the assumed external variability. Thus, while neuronal variability has a rich history of study, there remains an impoverished mechanistic understanding of the low-dimensional structure of population-wide variability (Latham, 2016Latham P.E. Correlations demystified.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 20: 6-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Determining whether output variability is internally generated through network interactions or externally imposed upon a network is a difficult problem, in which single-area population recordings may preclude any definitive solution. In this study we consider attention-mediated shifts in population variability obtained from simultaneous recordings of neuron pairs both within and between visual areas. In particular, attention reduces within area correlations (area V4; Cohen and Maunsell, 2009Cohen M.R. Maunsell J.H. Attention improves performance primarily by reducing interneuronal correlations.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) while simultaneously increasing between area correlations (areas V1 and MT; Ruff and Cohen, 2016aRuff D.A. Cohen M.R. Attention increases spike count correlations between visual cortical areas.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 7523-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We show that such differential correlation modulation is a difficult constraint to satisfy with a model in which fluctuations are strictly external to the network. Nevertheless, as discussed above, contemporary recurrent network models are at a loss to explain population-wide variability. A central goal of this study is to put forth a new circuit-based theory of low-dimensional variability in recurrent networks and explore how plausible modulation schemes can differentially control within and between area correlations. The asynchronous solution of classical balanced networks necessitates that inhibition dynamically tracks and cancels any correlations stemming from recurrent excitation (Renart et al., 2010Renart A. de la Rocha J. Bartho P. Hollender L. Parga N. Reyes A. Harris K.D. The asynchronous state in cortical circuits.Science. 2010; 327: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). This requirement has forced theorists to assume that the time course of inhibitory synapses is faster than that of excitatory synapses (Renart et al., 2010Renart A. de la Rocha J. Bartho P.

However, this is at odds with recorded synaptic physiology, in which excitatory conductances rise and decay faster than inhibitory ones (Geiger et al., 1997Geiger J.R. Lübke J. Roth A. Frotscher M.

Balanced networks of spiking neurons with spatially dependent recurrent connections.Phys. Rev.

Smith M.A. Kohn A. Rubin J.E. Doiron B. The spatial structure of correlated neuronal variability.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this study, we consider multi-area models of spatially distributed balanced networks and show that when inhibition has slower kinetics than excitation in these networks, matching physiology, they internally produce low-dimensional population-wide variability. Unlike networks that lack spatial structure, these networks produce spiking activity that robustly captures the rich diversity of firing rate and correlation structure of real population recordings. Further, attention-mediated top-down modulation of inhibitory neurons in our model provides a parsimonious mechanism that controls population-wide variability in agreement with the within and between area experimental results. There is a long-standing research program aimed at providing a circuit-based understanding for cortical variability (Shadlen and Newsome, 1998Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T.

Our work is a critical advance through providing a mechanistic theory for the genesis, propagation, and modulation of realistic low-dimensional population-wide shared variability based on established circuit structure and synaptic physiology. Multi-electrode recordings from visual area V4 during an orientation change detection task show that the mean spike count correlation coefficient between neuron pairs in V4 is largely reduced when the monkeys were cued to pay attention to the neurons’ spatial receptive field (Figure 1A; Cohen and Maunsell, 2009Cohen M.R.

Recently, simultaneous recordings from two visual areas, MT and V1, during a similar attention task (Ruff and Cohen, 2016aRuff D.A. Cohen M.R. Attention increases spike count correlations between visual cortical areas.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 7523-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), show that in addition to a reduction of mean spike count correlations between neuron pairs within an area (mean pairwise attention-related MT correlation decrease was 0.019, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.017; mean pairwise attention-related V1 correlation decrease was 0.008, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 4.9 × 10−6; Ruff and Cohen, 2016aRuff D.A. Cohen M.R. Attention increases spike count correlations between visual cortical areas.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 7523-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), there is an attention-mediated increase of spike count correlations across areas V1 and MT (Figure 1B). This differential modulation of within and between area correlations offers a strong constraint from which to build circuit models of population-wide variability. Before we explore population variability in circuit models of cortex, we first quantify how variability is structured across a recorded population. Using dimensionality reduction tools, we partition the V4 covariance matrix into the shared variability among the population and the private noise to each neuron (Cunningham and Yu, 2014Cunningham J.P. Yu B.M. Dimensionality reduction for large-scale neural recordings.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1500-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, Williamson et al., 2016Williamson R.C. Cowley B.R. Litwin-Kumar A. Doiron B. Kohn A. Smith M.A. Yu B.M. Scaling properties of dimensionality reduction for neural populations and network models.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2016; 12: e1005141Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The eigenvalues of the shared covariance matrix represent the variance along each dimension (or latent variable), while the corresponding eigenvectors represent the projection weights of the latent variables onto each neuron (STAR Methods). The V4 data show a single dominant eigenmode (Figure 1C, left; for single-session results, see Figure S1), indicating a primarily one-dimensional latent structure in the population variability. The projection weight of the dominant eigenmode onto the individual neurons is primarily of the same sign (Figure 1C, middle, weights are dominant positive), meaning that the latent variable causes positive correlations across the population. Indeed, after subtracting the first eigenmode the mean residual covariances are very small (Figure 1C, right). Moreover, attention affects population-wide variability primarily by quenching this dominant eigenmode (Figure 1C, left, orange versus green) and the attentional modulation in the dominant eigenmode is highly correlated with the modulation in mean covariance (Figure S1C). The low-dimensional structure of shared variability in our data is consistent with similar analysis in other cortices (Williamson et al., 2016Williamson R.C. Cowley B.R. Litwin-Kumar A. Doiron B.

Goris R.L. Cohen M. Simoncelli E.P. Attention stabilizes the shared gain of V4 populations.eLife. 2015; 4: e08998Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Armed with the V4 and V1-MT population analysis, we next explore the constraints that circuit models must satisfy in order to capture attentional modulation that differentially modulates the shared variability within and between cortical areas. Since the population-wide fluctuations are well described by a single latent variable that influences all neurons (Figure 1C), we represent the aggregate population responses with scalar random variables: MT and V1 (Figure 2A). To begin, we assume that population responses are linear in their inputs and that V1 projects to MT with strength γ. We suppose a hidden source of variability, H, which projects to MT and V1 with strength β and κ, respectively (Figure 2A); without loss of generality, we take β=1. In total, we have MT=γV1+H and V1=X0+κH, where X0 is independent from H. We assume that attention acts to reduce the variability of the hidden variable, Var(H), and to increase the coupling strength γ. We first consider how attention affects the covariance between MT and V1 in our model; our linear system gives the following:Cov(MT,V1)=γVar(V1)+κVar(H).(Equation 1) For κ>0, an attention-mediated reduction of Var(H) acts to reduce the covariance between V1 and MT. This is at odds with our cortical recordings (Figure 1B). We explore the case in which κ=0 to circumnavigate the tension between an increase in γ and a decrease in Var(H). In effect, this assumes that MT has a source of variability that is private from V1. With κ=0, the variance of the MT population obeysVar(MT)=γ2Var(V1)+Var(H).(Equation 2) The contributions to MT variability from the upstream area V1 and the hidden source H are clear. Further, attention drives opposing influences on Var(MT) through an increase in γ being countered by a decrease in Var(H). However, unlike the case of Cov(MT,V1), we cannot simply choose γ to be zero to mitigate this competition (because V1 would then not drive MT). Indeed, if the decrease in Var(H) is only moderate, then attention will increase both Cov(MT,V1) and Var(MT) (Figure 2B, middle), again at odds with experiments (Figures 1A and 1B). In total, with an assumption of H being private to MT (κ=0), then to have a reduction in Var(MT) combined with an increase in Cov(MT,V1), we require that the attention-mediated suppression in the variability of H be large (Figure 2B, right). These arguments can be generalized over a range of parameters (Methods S1; Figure S2). In sum, we have exposed three constraints that, if satisfied, will cause cortical circuit models of population-wide variability to capture the differential modulation of within and between area variability.(1)The shared variability across a neuronal population is low dimensional.(2)There is a source of attention-mediated population-wide variability in downstream areas that is private from upstream areas.(3)The attention-mediated suppression of the private variability needs to be substantial. The second constraint could be produced by each cortical population being paired with an external variability source that projects exclusively to that area. This solution requires strong assumptions about how the cortex devotes and organizes biological resources to drive neuronal variability. In contrast, we explore the more parsimonious hypothesis whereby recurrently coupled networks produce low-dimensional variability through internal interactions, and hence variability is private to the population by construction (Figure 2C). Further, if the variability is internally generated, then the third constraint requires a strong nonlinearity to fully suppress variability in the attended state. In the next sections, we investigate how a physiologically realistic network of spiking neuron models can satisfy these three constraints. Networks of spiking neuron models where strong excitation is balanced by opposing recurrent inhibition internally produce high single-neuron variability (Figure 3Ai) with a broad distribution of firing rates (Figure 3B, top purple curve; van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996van Vreeswijk C.

However, these networks enforce an asynchronous solution (Figure 3C, top purple), and as such fail to explain population-wide shared variability (Renart et al., 2010Renart A. de la Rocha J. Bartho P.

This approximation ignores the abundant evidence that cortical connectivity is spatially ordered with a connection probability falling off with the physical distance between neuron pairs (Levy and Reyes, 2012Levy R.B.

However, how stem cell homeostasis is achieved in environments where cells are motile and dispersed among their progeny remains unknown. Using murine spermatogenesis as a model, we find that spermatogenic stem cell density is tightly regulated by the supply of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) from lymphatic endothelial cells. We propose that stem cell homeostasis is achieved through competition for a limited supply of FGFs. We show that the quantitative dependence of stem cell density on FGF dosage, the biased localization of stem cells toward FGF sources, and stem cell dynamics during regeneration following injury can all be predicted and explained within the framework of a minimal theoretical model based on “mitogen competition.” We propose that this model provides a generic and robust mechanism to support stem cell homeostasis in open, or facultative, niche environments."
https://openalex.org/W2904183492,"Animals must respond to the ingestion of food by generating adaptive behaviors, but the role of gut-brain signaling in behavioral regulation is poorly understood. Here, we identify conserved ion channels in an enteric serotonergic neuron that mediate its responses to food ingestion and decipher how these responses drive changes in foraging behavior. We show that the C. elegans serotonergic neuron NSM acts as an enteric sensory neuron that acutely detects food ingestion. We identify the novel and conserved acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) DEL-7 and DEL-3 as NSM-enriched channels required for feeding-dependent NSM activity, which in turn drives slow locomotion while animals feed. Point mutations that alter the DEL-7 channel change NSM dynamics and associated behavioral dynamics of the organism. This study provides causal links between food ingestion, molecular and physiological properties of an enteric serotonergic neuron, and adaptive feeding behaviors, yielding a new view of how enteric neurons control behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2905868380,"Transmembrane member 16A (TMEM16A) is the Ca2+-activated chloride channel in airways and intestine. It has been associated with goblet cell metaplasia, as expression of TMEM16A is strongly up-regulated in cystic fibrosis and asthma during mucus hypersecretion. However, the possible role of TMEM16A for mucus production or mucus secretion remains obscure, and whether TMEM16A controls the function of intestinal goblet cells is entirely unknown. Basal mucus secretion in lungs occurs through low levels of ATP in the airway surface liquid. Here, we report for the first time that TMEM16A is essential for basal secretion of mucus in airways and intestine. Airway-ciliated and intestinal epithelial-specific knockout of TMEM16A ( TMEM16Aflox/floxFoxJ1, TMEM16Aflox/floxVil1) leads to accumulation of mucus in airway club (Clara) cells and intestinal goblet cells, respectively. Acute ATP-induced mucus secretion by airway club cells is inhibited when TMEM16A is knocked out in ciliated cells, possibly as a result of compromised release of prosecretory cytokines. Knockdown or inhibition of TMEM16A in human Calu3 airway epithelial cells indicates compromised IL-8 release. In intestinal goblet cells lacking expression of TMEM16A, mucus accumulates as a result of compromised ATP-induced secretion. In contrast, cholinergic mucus secretion by compound exocytosis is independent of TMEM16A. The data demonstrate a previously unrecognized role of TMEM16A for membrane exocytosis and describe a novel, ATP-driven pathway for intestinal mucus secretion. We conclude that ATP-dependent mucus secretion in both airways and intestine requires TMEM16A. The present results may form the basis for a novel, therapeutic approach for the treatment of mucus hypersecretion in inflammatory airway and intestinal disease.-Benedetto, R., Cabrita, I., Schreiber, R., Kunzelmann, K.

https://openalex.org/W2828679631,"Our experiences often overlap with each other, yet we are able to selectively recall individual memories to guide decisions and future actions. The neural mechanisms that support such precise memory recall remain unclear. Here, using ultra-high field 7T MRI we reveal two distinct mechanisms that protect memories from interference. The first mechanism involves the hippocampus, where the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal predicts behavioral measures of memory interference, and representations of context-dependent memories are pattern separated according to their relational overlap. The second mechanism involves neocortical inhibition. When we reduce the concentration of neocortical GABA using trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), neocortical memory interference increases in proportion to the reduction in GABA, which in turn predicts behavioral performance. These findings suggest that memory interference is mediated by both the hippocampus and neocortex, where the hippocampus separates overlapping but context-dependent memories using relational information, and neocortical inhibition prevents unwanted co-activation between overlapping memories."
https://openalex.org/W2905964243,"Most studies report a positive relationship of work engagement with health and job performance, but, occasionally, a “dark side of engagement” has also been uncovered. The current study examined two hypotheses: whether work engagement has (1) a U-shaped curvilinear relation with psychological distress and (2) an inverted U-shaped curvilinear relation with job performance (i.e., in-role performance and creative behavior). A two-wave longitudinal Internet survey with a time lag of seven months was conducted among 1,967 Japanese employees. To test our hypotheses, we used a two-wave panel design and examined the lagged and concurrent relations between work engagement and both outcomes. The results confirmed that work engagement had a curvilinear relation with psychological distress concurrently; a favorable effect was found initially, but this disappeared at intermediate levels of work engagement, and, at higher levels, an adverse effect became prominent. In addition, work engagement had a curvilinear relation with in-role performance both concurrently and longitudinally; the higher the levels of work engagement, the stronger the favorable effects on in-role performance. However, contrary to our expectations, work engagement had a linear relation with psychological distress longitudinally and with creative behavior both concurrently and longitudinally. Hence, our results suggest that work engagement plays a different role in health enhancement compared to performance enhancement. Leveling-off and adverse effects of high work engagement were observed for psychological distress in the short and not in a long run. In contrast, no leveling-off effect of high work engagement was observed for job performance. Thus, except for the short-term effect on psychological distress, no dark side of work engagement was observed for psychological distress and job performance."

Novel insights into barriers and facilitators to ART initiation among healthy clients are needed to improve implementation of Test and Treat.A cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted across 10 health facilities in Mozambique. In-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with HIV-positive clients (60 who initiated/20 who did not initiate ART within Test and Treat) and 9 focus group discussion (FGDs) were conducted with health care workers (HCWs; n = 53). Data were analyzed using deductive and inductive analysis strategies. Barriers to ART initiation included: (1) feeling 'healthy'; (2) not prepared to start ART for life; (3) concerns about ART side effects; (4) fear of HIV disclosure and discrimination; (5) poor interactions with HCWs; (6) limited privacy at health facilities; and (7) perceptions of long wait times. Facilitators included the motivation to stay healthy and to take care of dependents, as well as new models of ART services such as adaptation of counseling to clients' specific needs, efficient patient flow, and integrated HIV/primary care services.ART initiation may be difficult for healthy clients in the context of Test-and-Treat.

Strategies could include targeted support for clients, community sensitization on the benefits of early ART initiation, client-centered approaches to patient care, and improved efficiency through multi-month scripting and increased workforce."
https://openalex.org/W2906017176,"Phytotoxic potential of rosmarinic acid (RA), a caffeic acid ester largely found in aromatic species, was evaluated on Arabidopsis through metabolomic and microscopic approaches. In-vitro bioassays pointed out that RA affected root growth and morphology, causing ROS burst, ROS scavengers activity inhibition and consequently, an alteration on cells organization and ultrastructure. In particular, RA-treatment (175 μM) caused strong vacuolization, alteration of mitochondria structure and function and a consistent ROS-induced reduction of their transmembrane potential (ΔΨm). These data suggested a cell energy deficit also confirmed by the metabolomic analysis, which highlighted a strong alteration of both TCA cycle and amino acids metabolism. Moreover, the increase in H2O2 and O2− contents suggested that RA-treated meristems underwent oxidative stress, resulting in apoptotic bodies and necrotic cells. Taken together, these results suggest that RA inhibits two of the main ROS scavengers causing high ROS accumulation, responsible of the alterations on mitochondrial ultrastructure and activity through ΔΨm dissipation, TCA-cycle alteration, cell starvation and consequently cell death on Arabidopsis seedlings. All these effects resulted in a strong inhibition on root growth and development, which convert RA in a promising molecule to be explored for further use in weed management."

We describe HIV incidence and uptake of HIV services in men 20–29 years(y) in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, before the roll-out of DREAMS. Methods We used data from a population-based demographic and HIV surveillance cohort. HIV incidence was estimated from anonymised testing in an annual serosurvey. Service uptake was assessed in 2011 and 2015, through two self-reported outcomes: 1) HIV testing in the past 12 months(m); 2) voluntary medical male circumcision(VMMC). Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios(OR) and 95% confidence intervals(CI) for factors associated with each outcome. Results HIV incidence in 2011–2015 was 2.6/100 person-years (95%CI = 2.0–3.4) and 4.2 (95%CI = 3.1–5.6) among men 20-24y and 25-29y, respectively, with no significant change from 2006–2010. N = 1311 and N = 1221 young men participated in the 2011 and 2015 surveys, respectively. In both years, <50% reported testing for HIV in the past 12m. In 2011, only 5% reported VMMC, but coverage in 2015 increased to 40% and 20% in men 20-24y and 25-29y, respectively. HIV testing was positively associated with higher education and mobility. Testing uptake was higher in men reporting >1 partner in the past 12m, or condom use at last sex, but lower in those reporting a casual partner (adjusted (a)OR = 0.53, 95%CI = 0.37–0.75). VMMC uptake was associated with survey year and higher education. Men aged 25-29y and those who were employed (aOR = 0.66; 95%CI = 0.49–0.89) were less likely to report VMMC. Conclusions HIV incidence in men 20-29y was very high, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should be considered in this population. Uptake of services was low. VMMC coverage increased dramatically from 2011 to 2015, especially among younger men, suggesting a demand for this service. Interventions designed with and for young men are urgently needed."

Such stress imprints would benefit plants obtained through vegetative propagation (propagules). Herein, our hypothesis was that the propagules obtained from plants previously exposed to water deficit would perform better under water deficit as compared to those obtained from plants that did not face stressful conditions. Sugarcane plants were grown under well-hydrated conditions or subjected to three cycles of water deficit by water withholding. Then, the propagules were subjected to water deficit. Leaf gas exchange was reduced under water deficit and the propagules from plants that experienced water deficit presented a faster recovery of CO2 assimilation and higher instantaneous carboxylation efficiency after rehydration as compared to the propagules from plants that never faced water deficit. The propagules from plants that faced water deficit also showed the highest leaf proline concentration under water deficit as well as higher leaf H2O2 concentration and leaf ascorbate peroxidase activity regardless of water regime. Under well-watered conditions, the propagules from plants that faced stressful conditions presented higher root H2O2 concentration and higher activity of catalase in roots as compared to the ones from plants that did not experience water shortage. Such physiological changes were associated with improvements in leaf area and shoot and root dry matter accumulation in propagules obtained from stressed plants. Our results suggest that root H2O2 concentration is a chemical signal associated with improved sugarcane performance under water deficit. Taken together, our findings bring a new perspective to the sugarcane production systems, in which plant acclimation can be explored for improving drought tolerance in rainfed areas."

Any random perturbation in this perfect symmetrical state is called Fluctuating Asymmetry (FA). Many studies have been conducted on FA as an indicator of Developmental Instability (DI) and its possible link with stress and individual quality in general and with attractiveness, health and level of masculinity or femininity in humans. Most human studies of facial asymmetry use 2D pictures and a limited number of landmarks. We developed a protocol to utilize high-density 3D scans of human faces to measure the level of asymmetry. A completely symmetric spatially dense anthropometric mask with paired vertices is non-rigidly mapped on target faces using an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration algorithm. A set of 19 manually indicated landmarks were used to validate the mapping precision. The protocol’s accuracy in FA calculation is assessed, and results show that a spatially dense approach is more accurate. In addition, it generates an integrated asymmetry estimate across the entire face. Finally, the automatic nature of the protocol provides a great advantage by omitting the tedious step of manual landmark indication on the biological structure of interest."

The diagnosis of BHDS is usually considered if kidney cancer occurs before age 50 years, is multifocal and/or bilateral or of the oncocytoma/hybrid oncocytoma-chromophobe type. Using a sample of 50 BHDS families with a total of 178 patients we analyzed how many kidney cancer patients fulfilled one or more of these criteria. Furthermore, we addressed the question if genotype-phenotype-correlations exist that can be used for risk stratification. Renal cell cancer occurred in 34/178 (19.1%) patients, and the reported male bias was not observed. Furthermore, most kidney malignancies occurred after the age of 50 years. Thus, the majority of tumors did not show the typical hallmarks of BHDS. A below-average tumor frequency (17.2%) was observed for the known mutational hotspot c.1285delC/dupC that was the cause of BHDS in 24% of families.

Lung tumor susceptible A/J mice (male, 4–5 weeks old) were exposed by oropharyngeal aspiration to vehicle, GMAW-SS fume (1.7 mg), or a low or high dose of surrogate metal oxides based on the respective weight percent of each metal in the fume: Cr2O3 + CaCrO4 (366 + 5 μg and 731 + 11 μg), NiO (141 and 281 μg), or Fe2O3 (1 and 2 mg). Bronchoalveolar lavage, histopathology, and lung/liver qPCR were done at 1, 7, 28, and 84 days post-aspiration. In a two-stage lung carcinogenesis model, mice were initiated with 3-methylcholanthrene (10 μg/g; intraperitoneal; 1x) or corn oil then exposed to metal oxides or vehicle (1 x/week for 5 weeks) by oropharyngeal aspiration. Lung tumors were counted at 30 weeks post-initiation. Results indicate the inflammatory potential of the metal oxides was Fe2O3 > Cr2O3 + CaCrO4 > NiO. Overall, the pneumotoxic effects were negligible for NiO, acute but not persistent for Cr2O3 + CaCrO4, and persistent for the Fe2O3 exposures. Fe2O3, but not Cr2O3 + CaCrO4 or NiO significantly promoted lung tumors. These results provide experimental evidence that Fe2O3 is an important mediator of welding fume toxicity and support epidemiological findings and the IARC classification."
https://openalex.org/W2807157600,"Nociceptive sensitization involves an increase in responsiveness of pain sensing neurons to sensory stimuli, typically through the lowering of their nociceptive threshold. Nociceptive sensitization is common following tissue damage, inflammation, and disease and serves to protect the affected area while it heals. Organisms can become sensitized to a range of noxious and innocuous stimuli, including thermal stimuli. The basic mechanisms underlying sensitization to warm or painfully hot stimuli have begun to be elucidated, however, sensitization to cold is not well understood. Here, we develop a Drosophila assay to study cold sensitization after UV-induced epidermal damage in larvae. Larvae respond to acute cold stimuli with a set of unique behaviors that include a contraction of the head and tail (CT) or a raising of the head and tail into a U-Shape (US). Under baseline, non-injured conditions larvae primarily produce a CT response to an acute cold (10°C) stimulus, however, we show that cold-evoked responses shift following tissue damage: CT responses decrease, US responses increase and some larvae exhibit a lateral body roll (BR) that is typically only observed in response to high temperature and noxious mechanical stimuli. At the cellular level, class III neurons are required for the decrease in CT, chordotonal neurons are required for the increase in US, and chordotonal and class IV neurons are required for the appearance of BR responses after UV. At the molecular level, we found that the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel brivido-1 (brv1) is required for these behavioral shifts. Our Drosophila model will allow us to precisely identify the genes and circuits involved in cold nociceptive sensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2905639080,"The cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a glycoprotein that is processed through several proteolytic pathways. Modulators of PrPC proteolysis are of interest because full-length PrPC and its cleavage fragments differ in their propensity to misfold, a process that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. PrPC may also act as a receptor for neurotoxic, oligomeric species of other proteins that are linked to neurodegeneration. Importantly, the PrPC C-terminal fragment C1 does not contain the reported binding sites for these oligomers. Western blotting would be a simple end point detection method for cell-based screening of compound libraries for effects on PrPC proteolysis or overall expression level. However, traditional Western blotting methods provide unreliable quantification and have only low throughput. Consequently, we explored capillary-based Western technology as a potential alternative; we believe that this study is the first to report analysis of PrPC using such an approach. We successfully optimized the detection and quantification of the deglycosylated forms of full-length PrPC and its C-terminal cleavage fragments C1 and C2, including simultaneous quantification of β-tubulin levels to control for loading error. We also developed and tested a method for performing all cell culture, lysis, and deglycosylation steps in 96-well microplates prior to capillary Western analysis. These advances represent steps along the way to the development of an automated, high-throughput screening pipeline to identify modulators of PrPC expression levels or proteolysis."

Whilst social support is known to facilitate psychological adjustment to cancer, patients' and caregivers' experiences of social support within a treatment setting and their perceptions of the role of the treating team in providing this support is unknown. Specifically, there is a gap in the research that explores in detail who people affected by colorectal cancer consider to be supportive, and the function, timing and nature of this support, whilst receiving treatment. This study explored both patients' and caregivers' a) experiences of social support and how this relates to their experience of treatment; and b) what facilitates support in the treatment setting.Individual interviews (N = 20) were conducted with patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer and caregivers of such patients. Audiotaped interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using the framework method.Three major themes emerged from the data: a) treating team as a source of support, highlighting the importance of connection with the treating team; b) changes in existing social supports, encompassing issues regarding distance in interpersonal relationships as a consequence of cancer; and c) differing dimensions of support, exploring the significance of shared experience, practical, financial, and emotional support.Patients and caregivers perceived the treating team as a major source of support. Support from the treating team was particularly important in the context of the changes that occur as a result of a diagnosis of colorectal cancer and the effects of subsequent treatment. Incidental support from others encountered in the treatment setting was also experienced and was equally important to both patients and caregivers. This has implications for the way health care professionals respond to both patients and caregivers in the treatment setting in terms of communication, interventions and environment."

This study explored the impact of social and cultural changes experienced by seven migrant communities residing in Greater Western Sydney, Australia. It deconstructed the role of local community and networks in their initial settlement in absence of traditional forms of community support. Data were collected through fourteen focus group discussions (164 participants). Five major themes emerged: (i) changing gender roles and women empowerment; (ii) sending money home; (iii) culture shock and increased intercultural conflict; (iv) change in lifestyle from collective to individual culture; and (v) role of extended community in mitigating culture shock. These findings suggest that community interventions aimed at improving cultural and social engagement of migrants employ social capital framework. This will ensure enhanced communication within migrant families and communities from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W2905898407,"Introduction Classic ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by early onset ataxia, immune deficiency, sino-pulmonary disease, lymphoid/solid malignancies and telangiectasias. Prior studies have suggested that chronic inflammation and premature aging may contribute to the development of malignancy and pulmonary disease in people with A-T. To further examine the link between A-T and inflammation, we hypothesized that subjects with classic A-T would have greater enrichment of inflammatory pathways in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) compared to non A-T age-matched controls. To test this hypothesis we used RNAseq as an unsupervised approach to identify biological processes altered in people with classic A-T. Methods PBMCs were isolated from subjects with classic A-T and compared to non-A-T age-matched healthy controls. RNAseq with differential gene expression analyses was then performed. Selected genes were validated by RT-qPCR using cohorts of subjects consisting of classic A-T, mild A-T or non-A-T controls. Subjects with mild A-T were characterized by later onset/mild neurologic features and normal/near normal immune status. Results RNAseq revealed 310 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including genes involved in inflammation, immune regulation, and cancer. Using gene set enrichment analysis, A-T subjects were found to have biological processes enriched for inflammatory and malignancy pathways. In examining a cohort of A-T subjects in which baseline serum IL8 and IL6 levels were measured previously, an association was found between higher serum IL8 levels and higher likelihood of developing malignancy and/or death in a subsequent 4–6 year period. Conclusion RNAseq using PBMCs from subjects with classic A-T uncovered differential expression of immune response genes and biological processes associated with inflammation, immune regulation, and cancer. Follow-up of A-T subjects over a 4–6 year period revealed an association between higher baseline serum IL8 levels and malignancy/death. These findings support a role for inflammation as a contributing factor in A-T phenotypes."

https://openalex.org/W2906459477,"Poison frogs acquire chemical defenses from the environment for protection against potential predators. These defensive chemicals are lipophilic alkaloids that are sequestered by poison frogs from dietary arthropods and stored in skin glands. Despite decades of research focusing on identifying poison frog alkaloids, we know relatively little about how environmental variation and subsequent arthropod availability impacts alkaloid loads in poison frogs. We investigated how seasonal environmental variation influences poison frog chemical profiles through changes in the diet of the Climbing Mantella (Mantella laevigata). We collected M. laevigata females on the Nosy Mangabe island reserve in Madagascar during the wet and dry seasons and tested the hypothesis that seasonal differences in rainfall is associated with changes in diet composition and skin alkaloid profiles of M. laevigata. The arthropod diet of each frog was characterized into five groups (i.e. ants, termites, mites, insect larvae, or ‘other’) using visual identification and cytochrome oxidase 1 DNA barcoding. We found that frog diet differed between the wet and dry seasons, where frogs had a more diverse diet in the wet season and consumed a higher percentage of ants in the dry season. To determine if seasonality was associated with variation in frog defensive chemical composition, we used gas chromatography / mass spectrometry to quantify alkaloids from individual skin samples. Although the assortment of identified alkaloids was similar across seasons, we detected significant differences in the abundance of certain alkaloids, which we hypothesize reflects seasonal variation in the diet of M. laevigata. We suggest that these variations could originate from seasonal changes in either arthropod leaf litter composition or changes in frog behavioral patterns. Although additional studies are needed to understand the consequences of long-term environmental shifts, this work suggests that alkaloid profiles are relatively robust against short-term environmental perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2905734600,"TNF-α-converting enzyme, a member of the ADAM (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase) protease family and also known as ADAM17, regulates inflammation and regeneration in health and disease. ADAM17 targets are involved in pain development and hypersensitivity in animal models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. However, the role of ADAM17 in the pain pathway is largely unknown. Therefore, we used the hypomorphic ADAM17 (ADAM17ex/ex) mouse model to investigate the importance of ADAM17 in nociceptive behavior, morphology, and function of primary afferent nociceptors. ADAM17ex/ex mice were hyposensitive to noxious stimulation, showing elevated mechanical thresholds as well as impaired heat and cold sensitivity. Despite these differences, skin thickness and innervation were comparable to controls. Although dorsal root ganglia of ADAM17ex/ex mice exhibited normal morphology of peptidergic and nonpeptidergic neurons, a small but significant reduction in the number of isolectin β-4-positive neurons was observed. Functional electrical properties of unmyelinated nociceptors showed differences in resting membrane potential, afterhyperpolarization, and firing patterns in specific subpopulations of sensory neurons in ADAM17ex/ex mice. However, spinal cord morphology and microglia activity in ADAM17ex/ex mice were not altered. Our data suggest that ADAM17 contributes to the processing of painful stimuli, with a complex mode of action orchestrating the function of neurons along the pain pathway.-Quarta, S., Mitrić, M., Kalpachidou, T., Mair, N., Schiefermeier-Mach, N., Andratsch, M., Qi, Y., Langeslag, M., Malsch, P., Rose-John, S., Kress, M.

Although reports have challenged the molecular basis of the mechanisms underlying genomic injury resistance, little is yet known regarding the possible involvement of other tardigrade macromolecules in injury during a stress experience. In this report, we show that the tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris can accumulate molecular damages by means of in situ detection of carbonyls. Furthermore, we demonstrate that living tardigrade can accumulate carbonylation. Finally, we reveal that anhydrobiotic tardigrade can be constitutively affected by carbonylation that marks aging in other metazoans."

We designed a Navon Figures eyetracking paradigm (i.e. large figure composed of small figures), requiring an individual to vary only the information attended to within an image. We found that participants have a characteristic constriction of the pupil waveform during selection of local information relative to global information. Because stimuli and lighting conditions were identical across conditions, this indicates that pupil changes may serve in a visual filtering mechanism important for attentional selection. This work represents the first characterization of pupil response in the context of selective attention, suggesting that mechanisms underlying the earliest stages of visual processes could be relevant for perception and visual selection."

To allow real-time assessment of samples while maintaining a blind trial, the first 267 enrolled participants were selected for evaluation. At failure, plasma samples from 20/50 participants (16/20 maraviroc-treated) with CXCR4-using virus and all 38 (13 maraviroc-treated) with CCR5-tropic virus were evaluated. Of those maraviroc-treated participants with CXCR4-using virus at failure, genotypic and phenotypic clonal tropism determinations showed >90% correspondence in 14/16 at Day 1 and 14/16 at failure. Phylogenetic analysis of clonal sequences detected pre-treatment progenitor CXCR4-using virus, or on-treatment virus highly divergent from the Day 1 R5 virus, excluding possible co-receptor switch through maraviroc-mediated evolution. Re-analysis of pre-treatment samples using the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile® assay detected CXCR4-using virus pre-treatment in 16/20 participants failing with CXCR4-using virus. Post-maraviroc reversion of CXCR4-use to CCR5-tropic occurred in 7/8 participants with follow-up, suggesting selective maraviroc inhibition of CCR5-tropic variants in a mixed-tropic viral population, not emergence of de novo mutations in CCR5-tropic virus, as the main virologic escape mechanism. Maraviroc-resistant CCR5-tropic virus was observed in plasma from 5 treated participants with virus displaying reduced maximal percent inhibition (MPI) but no evidence of IC50 change. Env clones with reduced MPI showed 1–5 amino acid changes specific to each V3-loop region of env relative to Day 1. However, transferring on-treatment resistance-associated changes using site-directed mutagenesis did not always establish resistance in Day 1 virus, and key ‘signature’ mutation patterns associated with reduced susceptibility to maraviroc were not identified. Evolutionary divergence of the CXCR4-using viruses is confirmed, emphasizing natural selection not influenced directly by maraviroc; maraviroc simply unmasks pre-existing lineages by inhibiting the R5 virus. For R5-viral failure, resistance development through drug selection pressure was uncommon and manifested through reduced MPI and with virus strain–specific mutational patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2905980662,"Objectives This study aims to investigate the differences in the utilisation of preventive health services among standard, nonstandard workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. Methods We used the 4th and 5th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationwide survey conducted from the year 2007 to 2012. Economically active workers between the ages of 25 and 64 were grouped into standard, nonstandard, the self-employed, and the unpaid family workers (N = 16,964). Outcome variables are the uptake of preventive health services including influenza vaccination, regular medical check-up, and four types of cancer screenings. We used multivariate logistic models. Results Overall, non-standard workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers were less likely to use the preventive health care compared to the standard workers. In particular, the self-employed were less likely to use all the six services compared to the standard workers and showed the lowest level of uptakes among the four working groups. Moreover, the service uptake of the non-standard workers was lower than that of standard workers in all services; except the colon cancer screening. On the other hand, unpaid family workers showed mixed results. While the uptake of influenza vaccination and regular health screening were lower, participation to the cancer screening was not lower compared to that of standard workers. Conclusion There were gaps in the utilisation of preventive services among workers depending on their employment types. Access to preventive health care services of nonstandard workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers should be prioritised."

The aim of this study is to investigate the implementation of guideline-adherent treatments in a SCM for depression in routine care. We analyzed care provider documentation data of n = 569 patients treated within a SCM. Rates of guideline-adherent treatment selections and initializations as well as accordance between selected and initialized treatment were evaluated for patients with mild, moderate and severe depression. Guideline-adherent treatment selection and initialization was highest for mild depression (91% resp. 85%). For moderate depression, guideline-adherent treatments were selected in 68% and applied in 54% of cases. Guideline adherence was lowest for severe depression (59% resp. 19%). In a multiple mixed logistic regression model a significant interaction between guideline adherence in treatment selection/initialization and severity degree was found. The differences between treatment selection and initialization were significant for moderate (OR: 1.8 [95% CI: 1.30 to 2.59; p = 0.0006]) and severe depression (OR: 6.9; [95% CI: 4.24 to 11.25; p < .0001] but not for mild depression (OR = 1.8, [95%-CI: 0.68 to 4.56; p = 0.2426]). Accordance between selected and initialized treatment was highest for mild and lowest for severe depression. We conclude that SCMs potentially improve care for mild depression and guideline adherence of treatment selections. Guideline adherence of treatment initialization and accordance between treatment selection and initialization varies with depression severity. Deficits in treating severe depression adequately may be more a problem of failed treatment initializations than of inadequate treatment selections."

Methods Six heterogeneous lung phantoms were fabricated using a 3D-printer (3DISON, ROKIT, Seoul, Korea) to be dosimetrically equivalent to actual target regions of lung SBRT cases treated via gated VMAT. They were designed to move realistically via a motion device (QUASAR, Modus Medical Devices, Canada). Using the lung phantoms and a homogeneous phantom (model 500–3315, Modus Medical Devices), film dosimetry was performed with and without respiratory gating for VMAT delivery (TrueBeam STx; Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The measured results were analyzed with the gamma passing rates (GPRs) of 2%/1 mm criteria, by comparing with the calculated dose via the AXB and AAA algorithms of the Eclipse Treatment Planning System (version 10.0.28; Varian Medical Systems). Results GPRs were greater than the acceptance criteria 80% for all film measurements with the stationary and homogeneous phantoms in conventional QAs. Regardless of the heterogeneity of phantoms, there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in GPRs obtained with and without target motions; the statistical significance (p = 0.031) was presented between both algorithms under the utilization of heterogeneous phantoms. Conclusions Dosimetric verification with heterogeneous patient-specific lung phantoms could be successfully implemented as the evaluation method for gated VMAT delivery. In addition, it could be dosimetrically confirmed that the AXB algorithm improved the dose calculation accuracy under patient-specific simulations using 3D printed lung phantoms."

In this paper I evaluate the morphology of five Marginopora populations from around the Coral Sea by microCT-scanning. I argue that ecomorphological and ontogenetic variation is smaller than geographic variation in morphology. This forms the basis for the description of three new species, M. santoensis nov. spec., M. charlottensis nov. spec., M. orpheusensis nov. spec. Quantitative morphological variation between M. rossi, M. orpheusensis nov. spec. and M. charlottensis nov. spec. is overlapping, but each species has unique morphological characters supporting recognition as new species. Support to distinguish the deep living (M. rossi, M. charlottensis nov. spec., M. orpheusensis nov. spec.) and shallow living (M. vertebralis) Marginopora populations as separate species is strong, but not enough molecular phylogenetic data are available to test the three new deep-living species on the Great Barrier Reef hypothesis. However, detailed understanding of ecophenotypic variation in M. santoensis nov. spec. supports the conclusion that it is unlikely that ecophenotypic variation can explain the morphological variation between the three species. I argue that the number of species in this genus is underestimated, and that there are at least five species in the Coral Sea area alone."

During each web search on each computer and smartphone, three major search engines in China were used, namely, Baidu, Sogou and 360. The search terms used were a combination of words, including one AED name (valproate/oxcarbazepine/levetiracetam/lamotrigine) and one Chinese word (""huaiyun"" or ""renshen"", which means pregnancy in Chinese). The top ten websites retrieved from each search were recorded. After the content of each website was evaluated, the sites were categorized into 9 types. Meanwhile, commercial advertisements on each web page were also registered.A total of 16,411 search results were assessed. After excluding the redundant web pages, 4840 search results were included in the data analysis. Only 12.05% of the search results were reliable, 47.75% were partly reliable, and 40.21% were unreliable. A total of 4139 (85.52%) webpages contained commercial advertisements.

https://openalex.org/W2906277688,"The proteolytic conversion of factor V to factor Va is central for amplified flux through the blood coagulation cascade. Heterodimeric factor Va is produced by cleavage at three sites in the middle of factor V by thrombin, yielding an N terminus-derived heavy chain and a C terminus-derived light chain. Here, we show that light chain formation resulting from the C-terminal cleavage is the rate-limiting step in the formation of fully cleaved Va. This rate-limiting step also corresponded to and was sufficient for the ability of cleaved factor V to bind Xa and assemble into the prothrombinase complex. Meizothrombin, the proteinase intermediate in thrombin formation, cleaves factor V more slowly than does thrombin, resulting in a pronounced defect in the formation of the light chain. A ∼100-fold reduced rate of meizothrombin-mediated light chain formation by meizothrombin corresponded to equally slow production of active cofactor and an impaired ability to amplify flux through the coagulation cascade initiated in plasma. We show that this defect arises from the occlusion of anion-binding exosite 2 in the catalytic domain by the covalently retained propiece in meizothrombin. Our findings provide structural insights into the prominent role played by exosite 2 in the rate-limiting step of factor V activation. They also bear on how factor V is converted into a cofactor capable of assembling into prothrombinase."
https://openalex.org/W2906362819,"Successful demonstrations of novel short-cut taking by animals, including humans, are open to interpretation in terms of learning that is not necessarily spatial. A classic example is that of Tolman, Ritchie, and Kalish (1946) who allowed rats to repeat a sequence of turns through the corridors of a maze to locate a food reward. When the entrance to the corridors was subsequently blocked and alternative corridors were made available, rats successfully selected the corridor leading most directly to the food location. However, the presence of a distinctive light above the goal, in both the training and testing phases, means that approach to the light as a beacon could have been the source of successful short-cutting. We report a replication of the experimental design of Tolman et al. with human participants who explored geometrically equivalent virtual environments. An experimental group, who followed the original procedure in the absence of any distinctive cues proximal to the goal, did not select the corridor which led most directly to the goal. A control group, who experienced a light above the goal during training and testing, were more likely to select a corridor which led in the direction of the goal. A second control group experienced the light above the goal during training, but in the test the location of this cue was shifted by 90° with respect to the start point of exploration. This latter group responded unsystematically in the test, neither selecting a corridor leading to the original goal location, nor one leading directly to the relocated light cue. The results do not support the hypothesis that travelling a multi-path route automatically leads to an integrated cognitive representation of that route. The data offer support for the importance of local cues which can serve as beacons to indicate the location of a goal."

A number of studies have dealt with associations between hair minerals and exposures such as health, dietary or environmental conditions. Most review papers, however, emphasize the necessity for validation of hair mineral measurements, since large variations can cause highly variable results. To address these issues, we answer the following questions: How can we ascertain the reliability of measurements?How can we assess and control the variability of measurements?How do we efficiently determine associations between hair minerals and exposures?How can we concisely present the reference values? Since hair minerals all have distinctive natures, it would be unproductive to examine each mineral individually to find significant and consistent answers that apply to all minerals. To surmount this difficulty, we used one simple model for all minerals to explore quantitative answers. Hair mineral measurements of six-year-old children were analyzed based on the statistical model. The analysis verified that most of the measurements were reliable, and their inter-individual variations followed two-parameter distributions. These results allow for sophisticated study designs and efficient statistical methods to examine the effects of various kinds of exposures on hair minerals."
https://openalex.org/W2953146154,"Pair bonds are often maintained through the reciprocal and coordinated exchange of communicative signals. The ability to recognize and appropriately respond to a partner’s signals will define a pair’s ability to reproduce. Individual variation in responsiveness, by shaping the formation and maintenance of strong pair bonds, will ultimately influence an individual’s reproductive output. Throughout the breeding period, female cowbirds (Molothrus ater) respond to male song displays using a vocalization known as the chatter. In this study, we investigated whether variation in chatters remained repeatable across years and predicted reproductive performance. A flock of cowbirds housed in a large aviary complex was observed during the spring of 2011 to 2012. We recorded courtship interactions, including singing behavior for males, and chatters and eggs laid by females. The rate with which females responded to song using chatters remained consistent across years, with some females predictably responding to more songs using chatters than others. During 2012, chattering predicted the number of eggs females laid and her paired status. Paired females were more likely to respond to songs with chatters, and there was a strong positive relationship between the number of eggs laid and the proportion of songs she responded to using chatters. Overall, these findings suggest that variation in female vocal behavior is associated with their reproductive success."

Various conditions are presented to ensure the existence and global asymptotic stability of positive periodic solution of the involved model. The method is based on coincidence degree theory and the idea of Lyapunov function. At last, simulation results are presented to show the correctness of theoretical findings."

Using data from HPTN 069/ACTG A5305, a randomized study of potential PrEP regimens comparing maraviroc alone, or together with TDF or emtricitabine (FTC), to TDF + FTC (control), we evaluated the impact of these regimens on QOL in at-risk HIV-uninfected U.S. women and men.MethodsQOL was measured at baseline (before starting medications) and every 8 weeks through week 48 using the EQ-5D-3L. Responses were converted to a scale from 0.0 (death) to 1.0 (perfect health), using published valuation weights. Mean scores were compared between groups at each time point using nonparametric testing. Multivariable linear regression was used to adjust for potential confounders.ResultsWe analyzed 186 women (median age 35 years, 65% black, 17% Hispanic) and 405 men (median age 30 years, 28% black, 22% Hispanic), including 9 transgender participants analyzed based on sex-at-birth. Mean baseline QOL was 0.91 for women and 0.95 for men. There were minimal changes in mean QOL over time for any regimen (women: p = 0.29; men: p = 0.14). There were no significant differences between participants who continued the regimen compared to participants who discontinued early (women: p = 0.61; men: p = 0.1). Mean QOL did not differ significantly by regimen at any time point, both unadjusted and after adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, adherence, and use of alcohol, marijuana, opiates, and other substances.ConclusionsQOL in at-risk individuals starting candidate PrEP regimens in a clinical trial is similar to the general population and maintained over time. This finding did not vary among regimens or when adjusted for demographics, adherence, and substance use. Our findings are the first to show that starting a candidate PrEP regimen in at-risk HIV-uninfected U.S. women and men was not associated with significant changes in QOL.Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov NCT01505114."
https://openalex.org/W2906170284,"Background Exercise capacity is an important feature in patients with COPD. Its impairment drives disability and dependency for daily activities performance. This study evaluated the six years change in exercise capacity in subjects with airflow obstruction and compared this to subjects without airflow obstruction, with and without a smoking history. Methods Cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET) were repeatedly performed during a six years follow up period. Peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), work rate (WRpeak), heart rate (HRpeak), minute ventilation (VEpeak), respiratory exchange ratio (RERpeak) and ventilatory reserve (VE/MVV) were collected as effort dependent outcomes. The slopes of oxygen uptake, ventilatory and mechanical efficiency (OUES, ΔVE/ΔVCO2 and ΔVO2/ΔWR) were collected as effort independent outcomes. Results One hundred and thirty-eight subjects were included. Thirty-eight presented airflow obstruction (63±6 years, 74% men, FEV1 90±15%pred), 44 had a smoking history but no airflow obstruction (61±5 years, 61% men, FEV1 105±15%pred) and 56 had never smoked (61±7 years, 57% men, FEV1 117±18%pred). At baseline, the airflow obstruction group had slightly worse exercise capacity in comparison to the never smoking control group, in absolute terms and expressed as percentage of the predicted value (VO2peak = 27±5 versus 32±8 ml/min/kg, p<0.01; 112±29 versus 130±33%pred, p = 0.04). Most exercise variables showed a statistically significant yearly deterioration, with exception of VE/MVV, ΔVE/ΔVCO2 and ΔVO2/ΔWR. The yearly decline in VO2peak and OUES was not faster in subjects with airflow obstruction than in smoking and never smoking controls (VO2peak -67 (9) versus -76 (9) ml/min, p = 0.44 and versus -58 (9), p = 0.47; OUES -32 (11) versus -68 (10), p = 0.03 and versus -68 (13), p = 0.03). Conclusions With exception of VO2peak, effort dependent variables deteriorated faster in subjects with airflow obstruction compared to never smoking controls. The deterioration of effort independent variables, however, was not accelerated in the airflow obstruction group compared to controls."
https://openalex.org/W2906293290,"Positive-strand RNA viruses generally assemble RNA replication complexes on rearranged host membranes. Alphaviruses, other members of the alpha-like virus superfamily, and many other positive-strand RNA viruses invaginate host membrane into vesicular RNA replication compartments, known as spherules, whose interior is connected to the cytoplasm. Brome mosaic virus (BMV) and its close relative, cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV), form spherules along the endoplasmic reticulum. BMV spherule formation and RNA replication can be fully reconstituted in S. cerevisiae, enabling many studies identifying host factors and viral interactions essential for these processes. To better define and understand the conserved, core pathways of bromovirus RNA replication, we tested the ability of CCMV to similarly support spherule formation and RNA replication in yeast. Paralleling BMV, we found that CCMV RNA replication protein 1a was the only viral factor necessary to induce spherule membrane rearrangements and to recruit the viral 2a polymerase (2apol) to the endoplasmic reticulum. CCMV 1a and 2apol also replicated CCMV and BMV genomic RNA2, demonstrating core functionality of CCMV 1a and 2apol in yeast. However, while BMV and CCMV 1a/2apol strongly replicate each others' genomic RNA3 in plants, neither supported detectable CCMV RNA3 replication in yeast. Moreover, in contrast to plant cells, in yeast CCMV 1a/2apol supported only limited replication of BMV RNA3 (<5% of that by BMV 1a/2apol). In keeping with this, we found that in yeast CCMV 1a was significantly impaired in recruiting BMV or CCMV RNA3 to the replication complex. Overall, we show that many 1a and 2apol functions essential for replication complex assembly, and their ability to be reconstituted in yeast, are conserved between BMV and CCMV. However, restrictions of CCMV RNA replication in yeast reveal previously unknown 1a-linked, RNA-selective host contributions to the essential early process of recruiting viral RNA templates to the replication complex."
https://openalex.org/W2906629519,"Colonization by Staphylococcus aureus is regularly assessed in patients undergoing major heart surgery (MHS). Despite pre-surgical decontamination attempts, a significant proportion of MHS patients remain colonized by S. aureus at the time of surgery. Nasal sampling can be improved by sampling extra-nasal areas. We evaluated whether processing lower respiratory tract (LRT) secretions enhanced the detection of S. aureus after MHS. Following a standard protocol, nasal swabs and LRT aspirates were obtained from all of the study patients at the time of surgery or in the immediate postoperative period. One swab was used for culture in the microbiology laboratory, and a second swab was used for the Xpert SA Nasal Complete assay. According to our definition of colonization (culture positive and/or PCR positive), 31 of 115 patients (26.9%) were colonized at the time of surgery. Among these, LRT samples only were positive in three patients (2.6% of the whole population and 9.7% of the carriers). The remaining 28 were either positive in the nasal sample or positive in both samples. The yield of the detection of colonization by S. aureus by including also LRT samples in patients undergoing MHS is limited and must be balanced with laboratory workload and demands on laboratory personnel.

https://openalex.org/W2906114980,"The connections between the error function used in multilinear regression and the expected, or assumed, properties of the data are investigated. It is shown that two of the most basic properties often required in data analysis, scale and rotational invariance, are incompatible. With this, it is established that multilinear regression using an error function derived from a geometric mean is both scale and reflectively invariant. The resulting error function is also shown to have the property that its minimizer, under certain conditions, is well approximated using the centroid of the error simplex. It is then applied to several multidimensional real world data sets, and compared to other regression methods."
