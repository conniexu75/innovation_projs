https://openalex.org/W2145255740,"Dendritic spines were imaged over days to months in the apical tufts of neocortical pyramidal neurons (layers 5 and 2/3) in vivo. A fraction of thin spines appeared and disappeared over a few days, while most thick spines persisted for months. In the somatosensory cortex, from postnatal day (PND) 16 to PND 25 spine retractions exceeded additions, resulting in a net loss of spines. The fraction of persistent spines (lifetime ≥ 8 days) grew gradually during development and into adulthood (PND 16–25, 35%; PND 35–80, 54%; PND 80–120, 66%; PND 175–225, 73%), providing evidence that synaptic circuits continue to stabilize even in the adult brain, long after the closure of known critical periods. In 6-month-old mice, spines turn over more slowly in visual compared to somatosensory cortex, possibly reflecting differences in the capacity for experience-dependent plasticity in these brain regions."

https://openalex.org/W1964945221,"Synaptic plasticity involves protein phosphorylation cascades that alter the density of AMPA-type glutamate receptors at excitatory synapses; however, the crucial phosphorylated substrates remain uncertain. Here, we show that the AMPA receptor-associated protein stargazin is quantitatively phosphorylated and that stargazin phosphorylation promotes synaptic trafficking of AMPA receptors. Synaptic NMDA receptor activity can induce both stargazin phosphorylation, via activation of CaMKII and PKC, and stargazin dephosphorylation, by activation of PP1 downstream of PP2B. At hippocampal synapses, long-term potentiation and long-term depression require stargazin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively. These results establish stargazin as a critical substrate in the bidirectional control of synaptic strength, which is thought to underlie aspects of learning and memory."
https://openalex.org/W2137435206,"The extensive connections of the entorhinal cortex with the hippocampus and the neocortex point to this region as a major interface in the hippocampal-neocortical interactions underlying memory. We asked whether hippocampal-dependent recall of spatial memory depends on the entorhinal cortex, and, if so, which parts are critical. After training in a Morris water maze, rats received fiber-sparing lesions in the dorsolateral band of the entorhinal cortex, which mediates much of the visuospatial input to the dorsal hippocampus. These lesions entirely disrupted retention and retarded new learning. Spatial memory was spared by lesions in the ventromedial band, which connects primarily with ventral hippocampus, but these lesions reduced defensive behavior on an elevated plus maze, mirroring the effects of damage to ventral hippocampus. The results suggest that the functional differences between dorsal and ventral hippocampus reflect their connectivity with modules of the entorhinal cortex that are differently linked to the rest of the cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2028985118,"Endocannabinoids mediate retrograde signal and modulate transmission efficacy at various central synapses. Although endocannabinoid release is induced by either depolarization or activation of Gq/11-coupled receptors, it is markedly enhanced by the coincidence of depolarization and receptor activation. Here we report that this coincidence is detected by phospholipase Cβ1 (PLCβ1) in hippocampal neurons. By measuring cannabinoid-sensitive synaptic currents, we found that the receptor-driven endocannabinoid release was dependent on physiological levels of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and markedly enhanced by depolarization-induced [Ca2+]i elevation. Furthermore, we measured PLC activity in intact neurons by using exogenous TRPC6 channel as a biosensor for the PLC product diacylglycerol and found that the receptor-driven PLC activation exhibited similar [Ca2+]i dependence to that of endocannabinoid release. Neither endocannabinoid release nor PLC activation was induced by receptor activation in PLCβ1 knockout mice. We therefore conclude that PLCβ1 serves as a coincidence detector through its Ca2+ dependency for endocannabinoid release in hippocampal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2107793453,"Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factors (KLFs) play diverse roles during cell differentiation and development in mammals. We have now shown by microarray analysis that expression of the KLF15 gene is markedly up-regulated during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes. Inhibition of the function of KLF15, either by expression of a dominant negative mutant or by RNA interference, both reduced the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and blocked adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes exposed to inducers of adipocyte differentiation. However, the dominant negative mutant of KLF15 did not affect the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) elicited by inducers of differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. In addition, ectopic expression of KLF15 in NIH 3T3 or C2C12 cells triggered both lipid accumulation and the expression of PPARγ in the presence of inducers of adipocyte differentiation. Ectopic expression of C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, or C/EBPα in NIH 3T3 cells also elicited the expression of KLF15 in the presence of inducers of adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, KLF15 and C/EBPα acted synergistically to increase the activity of the PPARγ2 gene promoter in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our observations thus demonstrate that KLF15 plays an essential role in adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells through its regulation of PPAR γ expression. Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factors (KLFs) play diverse roles during cell differentiation and development in mammals.

Our observations thus demonstrate that KLF15 plays an essential role in adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells through its regulation of PPAR γ expression. The amount of adipose tissue in the body is an important determinant of energy homeostasis in animals and is altered in various physiological or pathological conditions (1.Evans R.M. Barish G.D. Wang Y.-X. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). An increase in adipose tissue mass can arise through increases in cell size, cell number, or both (2.Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). The size of adipocytes varies markedly and reflects largely the amount of stored triglyceride, whereas the number of adipocytes is thought to increase as a result of the proliferation of preadipocytes and their subsequent differentiation into mature adipocytes.Murine preadipose cell lines, such as 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A, have been studied extensively to elucidate the mechanisms of growth and differentiation of preadipocytes (2.Rosen E.D.

Biol. 1997; 13: 231-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In response to exposure to appropriate hormonal inducers (such as agents that increase the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP, agonists of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, glucocorticoids, and fetal bovine serum), these cells first undergo several rounds of mitosis, known as clonal expansion, and then become quiescent again, express adipocyte-specific proteins, and acquire biochemical and morphological characteristics of mature adipocytes (2.Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 3.Hwang C.S. Loftus T.M. Mandrup S. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 231-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).Both the proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes are characterized by marked changes in the pattern of gene expression that are achieved by the sequential induction of transcription factors. Preadipocytes exposed to inducers of differentiation thus manifest an early and transient increase in the expression of the transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) 1The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; KLF, Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factor; CREB, cyclic AMP response element-binding protein; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA.1The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; KLF, Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factor; CREB, cyclic AMP response element-binding protein; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; RT, reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA. and C/EBPδ, which in turn appear to contribute to cell proliferation as well as to the subsequent increase in the expression of C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) (4.Lane M.D. Tang Q.Q.

A. 2004; 101: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The latter two proteins are thought to act synergistically in the transcriptional activation of a variety of adipocyte-specific genes, with each also reciprocally activating the expression of the other (2.Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 3.Hwang C.S. Loftus T.M. Mandrup S. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Pevsner J. Yang V.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1103-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 7.Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). All 16 members of the KLF family identified to date bind to GC-rich sequences including GC boxes and GT boxes (also known as CACCC boxes) (7.Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 8.Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34355-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Certain KLF proteins have been implicated in adipogenesis. KLF2 has thus been shown to negatively regulate adipogenesis through inhibition of PPARγ gene expression (9.Banerjee S.S. Feinberg M.W.

In addition, expression of KLF6 is transiently induced during adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (10.Inuzuka H. Wakao H. Masuho Y. Muramatsu M.A. Tojo H. Nanbu-Wakao R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of KLF15 induces adipocyte maturation and GLUT4 expression (11.Gray S. Feinberg M.W. Hull S. Kuo C.T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 34322-34328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), although the physiological significance of KLF15 in the induction or maintenance of terminal differentiation has remained unclear. We now provide evidence that KLF15 promotes maintenance of the biochemical and morphological characteristics of mature adipocytes through direct induction of PPARγ expression in cooperation with C/EBPα.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies, Reagents, and Cells—Antibodies to C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Antibodies to PPARγ (12.Hu E. Kin J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M.

Bernlohr (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN), respectively. Troglitazone was kindly provided by Sankyo Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Blasticidine S hydrochloride, hygromycin B, and puromycin dihydrochloride were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), Wako (Osaka, Japan), and Sigma, respectively; hexadimethrine bromide was also from Sigma. 3T3-L1, NIH 3T3, and C2C12 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and Plat-E retroviral packaging cells (14.Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by T. Kitamura (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan).Cell Culture and Staining—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained as described previously (15.Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kuroda S. Takata M. Sugimoto T. Spiegelman B.M. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28945-28952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Their differentiation into adipocytes was induced by treatment of confluent cells first for 2 days with insulin (5 μg/ml), 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and then for 2 days with insulin (5 μg/ml) alone in the same medium. The cells were then returned to the basal medium, which was replenished every other day.NIH 3T3 or C2C12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured to confluence. Adipogenesis in transfected cells was induced by treatment for 6 days with insulin (5 μg/ml), 0.25 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm IBMX, and 10 μm troglitazone in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then returned to the basal medium, which was replenished every other day.Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) obtained from PPARγ knock-out mice or their wild-type littermates were immortalized by the 3T3 protocol (16.Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar) and exposed to inducers of adipocyte differentiation as described above for NIH 3T3 cells. Cells were stained with oil red O as described (17.Sakaue H. Konishi M. Ogawa W. Asaki T. Mori T. Yamasaki M. Takata M. Ueno H. Kato S. Kasuga M. Itoh N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (8 days after the induction of differentiation) and was processed with RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Portions (10 μg) of the RNA were then used for synthesis of biotin-labeled cRNA, which in turn was used to probe Genechip Mouse MU74 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). After washing and staining, the arrays were scanned with a Hewlett Packard confocal laser scanner and visualized with Affymetrix Genechip 3.1 software. Finally, the results were analyzed with Genechip Analysis Suite software version 4.0 (Affymetrix), and the -fold differences in hybridization intensity between samples from undifferentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were determined.Expression Plasmids—A mammalian expression vector for KLF15 (pcDNA3.1/KLF15) was constructed by inserting the products of reverse transcription (RT) and the PCR obtained from rat adipose tissue RNA into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). To construct an expression vector for a deletion mutant of KLF15 that lacks the NH2-terminal 318 amino acids (Δ318), we amplified a DNA fragment encoding Δ318 by PCR with the sense primer 5′-CTGCCATGCACAAATGCACTTTC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-CTTCAGTTGATGGCGCGTAC-3′ and then inserted the PCR product into the PT7-blue T vector (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). The sequence of the inserted fragment was verified and then subcloned into pcDNA3.1. Mammalian expression vectors for C/EBPα or C/EBPβ were constructed by subcloning the corresponding mouse cDNAs (kindly provided by S. Akira, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) into pcDNA3.1.Retroviral Vectors and Infection—To produce retroviral vectors for green fluorescent protein (GFP), C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, KLF6, KLF9, KLF15, or Δ318, we subcloned cDNAs for GFP, mouse C/ebpα, mouse C/ebpβ, mouse C/ebpδ (kindly provided by S. Akira), mouse KLF6 (RT-PCR product of mouse adipose tissue RNA), mouse KLF9 (RT-PCR product of mouse adipose tissue RNA), rat KLF15, or Δ318 into pWZL containing blasticidine or hygromycin resistance genes (kindly provided by G. P. Nolan, Stanford University, Stanford, CA). To construct a retroviral vector for PPARγ2, we inserted a cDNA for mouse PPARγ2 (RT-PCR product of mouse adipose tissue RNA) into pMXs containing a puromycin resistance gene (kindly provided by T. Kitamura).NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing KLF15 (NIH/KLF15 cells) were generated with the retroviral vector pWZL/KLF15 as described (18.Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2283) Google Scholar), with the following modifications: Plat-E packaging cells were transfected with the retroviral vector with the use of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). After 24 h, the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h in fresh medium to obtain retrovirus-containing supernatants. NIH 3T3 cells (50 to 60% confluence) were then incubated with these supernatants in the presence of hexadimethrine bromide (4 μg/ml) for 12 h. Cells expressing KLF15 were selected on the basis of their resistance to blasticidine S (10 μg/ml) or hygromycin B (500 μg/ml).NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing other ectopic proteins with the exception of PPARγ2; 3T3-L1 cells stably expressing GFP (3T3-L1/GFP cells), KLF15, or Δ318; and C2C12 cells stably expressing GFP (C2C12/ GFP cells) or KLF15 were generated as described above for NIH/KLF15 cells. NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing PPARγ2 (NIH/PPARγ2 cells) were similarly generated with pMXs/PPARγ2 and were selected on the basis of their resistance to puromycin (2 μg/ml).Adenovirus Vectors and Infection—An adenoviral vector encoding rat KLF15 (AxCA-Klf15) was generated with the use of an Adenovirus Expression Kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (15.Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kuroda S. Takata M. Sugimoto T. Spiegelman B.M. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28945-28952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). An adenoviral vector encoding β-galactosidase (AxCA-lacZ) was kindly provided by I. Saito (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with adenovirus vectors as essentially described previously (15.Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kuroda S. Takata M. Sugimoto T. Spiegelman B.M. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28945-28952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).Northern and Immunoblot Analyses—Total RNA (15 μg) extracted from cells was subjected to Northern blot analysis with a full-length mouse aP2 cDNA, a fragment of mouse PPARγ cDNA, full-length mouse C/EBPα cDNA, full-length mouse C/EBPβ cDNA, full-length mouse C/EBPδ cDNA, full-length mouse KLF6 cDNA, full-length mouse KLF9 cDNA, full-length mouse KLF15 cDNA (RT-PCR product of mouse adipose tissue RNA), or a fragment of human GLUT4 cDNA as probes. Cell lysates (∼100 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis as described (15.Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kuroda S. Takata M. Sugimoto T. Spiegelman B.M. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28945-28952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).Electroporation—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with plasmids by electroporation as described previously (19.Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Nakamura T. Mori T. Nakamura K. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39951-39957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For transfection of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the cells were detached from culture dishes 5 days after exposure to inducers of differentiation by treatment with 2.5% trypsin and collagenase (0.5 mg/ml); they were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline before resuspension with plasmid DNA in the solution provided with Nucleofector Kit V (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). The plasmid DNA was then introduced into the cells by electroporation with the use of a Nucleofector instrument (program U-28). After electroporation, the cells were resuspended in culture medium and replated on culture dishes.Luciferase Reporter Assays—For GLUT4 gene promoter assays, NIH 3T3 cells plated in 24-well dishes (50 to 60% confluence) were transiently transfected with 500 ng of the reporter plasmid pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI) containing the human GLUT4 gene promoter (nucleotides -894 to +84 relative to the transcriptional start site), 500 ng of the indicated expression plasmids, and 100 ng of pCMV encoding β-galactosidase (pCMV/β-gal) with the use of the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). After incubation for 48 to 72 h, the cells were lysed in 100 μl of 1 times passive lysis buffer (Promega), and portions of the lysate were subjected to assays for firefly luciferase (Promega) and β-galactosidase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) activities. Promoter activity was determined as the ratio of luciferase to β-galactosidase activities. For PPARγ2 gene promoter assays, 3T3-L1 adipocytes (∼3 × 106) were transfected with 500 ng of pGL3-basic containing the mouse PPARγ2 gene promoter (nucleotides -626 to +60), 500 ng of the indicated expression plasmids, and 100 ng of pCMV/β-gal by electroporation and were subsequently assayed for firefly luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as described for the GLUT4 gene promoter assay.RNA Interference—The target sequences of the KLF15 gene selected for RNA interference (RNAi) comprised nucleotides 300 to 319 and nucleotides 1112 to 1131 relative to the transcriptional start site. To construct mammalian expression vectors for each of the corresponding small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), designated si300 and si1112, respectively, we amplified by PCR a DNA fragment including the mouse U6 (mU6) promoter and encoding the sense sequence of the siRNA, a short hairpin sequence, the antisense sequence of the siRNA, and a poly(A) terminator. PCR was performed for 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s with specific primers, the pMXs/mU6 plasmid (kindly provided by K. I. Nakayama, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan) as the template, and Ex-taq polymerase (Takara). The PCR primers were 5′-AGCGCCCGACCGAAAGGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACTAAGGTCGACAAAAAGCCTTCTGTTCCTGATACATCTCTTGAATGTAGCAGGAACAGAAGGCAAACAAGGCTTTTCTCCAAG-3′ (antisense) for si300 and 5′-AGCGCCCGACCGAAAGGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACTAAGGTCGACAAAAAGATGTACACCAAGAGCAGCTCTCTTGAAGCTGCTCTTGGTGTACATCAAACAAGGCTTTTCTCCAAG-3′ (antisense) for si1112. The PCR products were subcloned into PT7-blue T and their sequences were verified with the CUGA sequencing system (Nippongene, Tokyo, Japan). They were then subcloned into the NotI and SalI sites of pcDNA3.1, from which the cytomegalovirus promoter was subsequently deleted.RESULTSUp-regulation of KLF15 Gene Expression during Adipocyte Differentiation in 3T3-L1 Cells—We first profiled genes whose level of expression changed in association with the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes induced by IBMX, dexamethasone, and insulin. Total RNA isolated from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes was analyzed with mouse oligonucleotide microarrays, revealing that the differentiation of these cells was accompanied by an ∼80-fold increase in the abundance of KLF15 mRNA (Fig. 1A). The amounts of KLF9, KLF10, and KLF13 mRNAs were increased to much smaller extents, whereas those of KLF6 mRNA and of several other KLF gene transcripts were decreased, in association with 3T3-L1 cell differentiation. Consistent with these results, Northern blot analysis showed that the abundance of KLF15 and KLF9 mRNAs increased during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, whereas that of KLF6 mRNA decreased (Fig. 1B). KLF15 mRNA was first detected 4 days after the induction of differentiation, 2 days later than the initial increase in the amounts of PPARγ and aP2 mRNAs, and its abundance was increased maximally at 6 and 8 days. The time course of the up-regulation of KLF15 mRNA during adipocyte differentiation was similar to that apparent for C/EBPα and GLUT4 mRNAs. The amounts of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ mRNAs were already maximal at 2 days and had returned to basal levels by 4 to 6 days after the induction of differentiation.Inhibition of KLF15 Function by a Dominant Negative Mutant in 3T3-L1 Cells—To determine whether KLF15 is required for adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells, we constructed an expression vector for a putative dominant negative mutant (Δ318) that lacks the NH2-terminal 318 amino acids of KLF15, which contain the transactivation domain, leaving the DNA binding domain intact. To verify that the Δ318 mutant was able to inhibit KLF15 function, we examined the effect of its expression on the activity of the GLUT4 gene promoter, a target of KLF15 action (11.Gray S. Feinberg M.W. Hull S. Kuo C.T. Watanabe M. Sen-Banerjee S. DePina A. Haspel R. Jain M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34322-34328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We transiently cotransfected NIH 3T3 cells with a GLUT4 promoter-luciferase gene reporter construct together with an expression plasmid either for full-length KLF15 or for the Δ318 mutant. The activity of the GLUT4 gene promoter was increased by ∼50% by expression of wild-type KLF15 and was reduced by ∼50% by expression of Δ318 (Fig. 2A). In addition, Δ318 prevented the increase in GLUT4 gene promoter activity induced by the full-length protein, confirming that Δ318 acts in a dominant negative manner.Fig. 2Effect of a dominant negative mutant of KLF15 on adipocytic differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.A, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with a GLUT4 promoter-luciferase gene reporter plasmid (or pGL3-basic as a control), a β-galactosidase expression plasmid, and expression vectors for KLF15, the Δ318 mutant, or both KLF15 and Δ318 (or the pcDNA3.1 empty vector). The cells were subsequently assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities, and the former was normalized by the latter. Data represent normalized luciferase activity expressed relative to the value for cells transfected with pGL3-basic and pcDNA3.1; data are mean ± S.D. of triplicates from a representative experiment. B, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably expressing GFP, KLF15, or Δ318, as indicated, were subjected to Northern blot analysis of KLF15 mRNA. Control 3T3-L1 cells before or 8 days after exposure to inducers of differentiation were similarly analyzed. C, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably expressing GFP, KLF15, Δ318, or both Δ318 and PPARγ2 were stained with oil red O 8 days after exposure to inducers of differentiation. Macroscopic (upper panel) and microscopic (×100, lower panel) views are shown. D, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably expressing GFP, KLF15, Δ318, or both Δ318 and PPARγ2 were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to PPARγ, C/EBPα, aP2, or CREB (control) 8 days after exposure to inducers of differentiation. E and F, 3T3-L1 adipocytes 8 days after exposure to inducers of differentiation were infected with adenovirus vector AxCA-lacZ or AxCA-Klf15 at the indicted multiplicity of infection. 48 h after adenovirus infection (MOI), the cells were subjected to Northern blot analysis of KLF15 mRNA (E) or subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to PPARγ, C/EBPα, or CREB (control) (F). Data in B–F are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next constructed retroviral vectors encoding Δ318, wild-type KLF15, and GFP for expression of these proteins in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Fig. 2B). Expression of Δ318 in these cells greatly inhibited both the lipid accumulation (Fig. 2C) and the induction of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and aP2 (Fig. 2D) normally apparent 8 days after exposure of the cells to inducers of differentiation. Expression of GFP or of wild-type KLF15 did not affect these aspects of adipocyte differentiation. The amount of exogenous KLF15 mRNA by a retrovirus vector was one-half of that of endogenous KLF15 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2B). We have therefore investigated the effect of overexpression of KLF15 by an adenovirus vector on the induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα. Although the abundance of KLF15 mRNA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with an adenovirus vector for this protein at an multiplicity of infection of 30 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell was eight times to that of endogenous KLF15 mRNA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2E), this overexpression of KLF15 did not affect the amount of PPARγ and C/EBPα protein (Fig. 2F) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To examine whether this inhibitory effect of Δ318 on adipogenesis was prevented by coexpression of PPARγ2, we infected 3T3-L1 cells both with a Δ318-encoding retroviral vector containing a blasticidine resistance gene and with a PPARγ2-encoding retroviral vector containing a puromycin resistance gene. The infected cells were then subjected to selection in the presence of both blasticidine S and puromycin. The inhibitory effect of Δ318 on adipogenesis, as monitored by both lipid accumulation (Fig. 2C) and the expression of C/EBPα and aP2 (Fig. 2D), was indeed prevented by coexpression of PPARγ2, indicating that it was attributable to the prevention of PPARγ induction.Lack of Effect of Δ318 on the Expression of C/EBPβ in 3T3-L1 Cells—The increase in the amount of KLF15 mRNA during adipocytic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells occurred slightly later than did that in the amount of PPARγ mRNA (Fig. 1B). PPARγ mRNA was thus detected 2 days after exposure of cells to inducers of differentiation, whereas KLF15 mRNA was not apparent at this time. The transient increase in the abundance of the mRNAs for C/ebpβ and C/ebpδ, both of which directly induce the expression of PPARγ (20.Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 21.Wu Z. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was maximal 2 days after induction of differentiation. Furthermore, MEFs that lack C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are unable to differentiate into adipocytes (22.Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7432-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). These two proteins thus likely induce the expression of PPARγ before the induction of C/EBPα or KLF15 during adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. We next investigated whether the expression of the dominant negative mutant of KLF15 (Δ318) affected the induction of C/EBPβ or PPARγ during the 4 days of exposure of 3T3-L1 cells to inducers of differentiation, a period when the levels of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are increased. Immunoblot analysis revealed that expression of Δ318 in 3T3-L1 cells inhibited the expression of PPARγ on day 4 (Fig. 3) as it did on day 8 (Fig. 2D); it did not affect PPARγ abundance on day 2 (Fig. 3), however, a time before induction of KLF15 gene expression is apparent. The up-regulation of C/EBPβ expression, which was maximal 1 and 2 days after exposure to the inducers of differentiation, was not inhibited by Δ318 (Fig. 3). Moreover, overexpression of wild-type KLF15 slightly increased the abundance of PPARγ at 1 or 2 days after the induction of differentiation (Fig. 3), consistent with the previous observation that KLF15 promoted adipocyte differentiation (9.Banerjee S.S.

The pathological expansion of unstable trinucleotide repeats has been found to cause 15 neurological diseases, 9 of which are neurodegenerative diseases (also referred to as polyglutamine diseases) resulting from the expansion of CAG repeats within the coding region of the responsible genes. Those nine include Huntington's disease (HD), 1The abbreviations used are: HD, Huntington's disease; UPP, ubiquitin proteasome pathway; tNhtt; truncated N-terminal huntingtin; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; dbcAMP, N6,2′-O-dibutyryl-adenosine-3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; HSC, heat shock cognate. dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy, X-linked spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), and several spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17). All nine disorders are progressive, dominantly inherited (except spinal bulbar muscular atrophy), typically begin in midlife, and result in severe neuronal dysfunction and neuronal cell death. Increasing length of glutamine repeats in the affected individual strongly correlates with earlier age of onset and disease severity (1Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests a toxic gain-of-function effect of the polyglutamine expansion on the protein, and this novel neurotoxic property most likely involves an increased propensity for the disease protein to aggregate (2Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Neuron. 2001; 29: 15-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). In human disease tissue, transgenic animal models, and transfected cells expanded polyglutamine proteins have been shown to undergo intracellular aggregation, in most cases forming neuronal intranuclear inclusions (3Lin X. Cummings C.J. Zoghbi H.Y. Neuron. 1999; 24: 499-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the discovery of ubiquitinated aggregates or the neuronal intranuclear inclusions and the association of various chaperones and proteasome components with the aggregates suggest that the cells recognize the aggregated disease protein as abnormal and may represent an appropriate cellular response to refold or degrade aggregated mutant protein (4Cummings C.J.

Consistent with this idea, it has been experimentally demonstrated that overexpression of selective chaperones in the mammalian cell culture suppresses the aggregate formation and cell death (4Cummings C.J.

However, very little is known about the delivery of the expanded-polyglutamine proteins to the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) for degradation. In the present investigation, we studied the detail mechanism of ubiquitination of the expanded polyglutamine proteins using polyglutamine-expanded truncated N-terminal huntingtin (tNhtt) as well as truncated ataxin-3 as models. We found that CHIP, an ubiquitin ligase, associates with the expanded polyglutamine proteins and is responsible for their ubiquitination and degradation by proteasomes. Materials—Lactacystin, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), dbcAMP, and all cell culture reagents were obtained from Sigma. Lipofectamine 2000, Zeocin, G418, ponasterone A, and mouse monoclonal anti-v5 were purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitin was from Dako, and mouse monoclonal anti-GFP was from Roche Applied Science. Goat anti-mouse IgG-Cy3 was purchased from Molecular Probes and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. Expression Plasmids and Stable Cell Lines—The enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) and tNhtt expression constructs, pIND-tNhtt-EGFP-16Q, pIND-tNhtt-150Q, and the generation of the stable cell lines of these constructs have been described previously (12Wang G.H. Mitsui K. Kotliarova S.E. Yamashita A. Nagao Y. Tokuhiro S. Iwatsubo T. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The construction of plasmids, pEGFP-N1-MJD(f)-20CAG and pEGFP-N1-MJD(f)-130CAG, pEGFP-N1-MJD(t)-20CAG, and pEGFP-N1-MJD(t)-80CAG were described elsewhere (13Wang G.H. Sawai N. Kotliarova S.E. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The full-length CHIP cDNA was isolated from the total RNA extracted from HeLa cells by reverse transcription-PCR. Construction of full-length and the U-box-deleted CHIP in pcDNA vector with v5 tag were made using PCR. Cell Culture, Transfection, Cell Viability Assay, and Counting of Aggregates—The wild type mouse neuro2a cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and the antibiotics penicillin/streptomycin. The stable cell lines (HD 16Q and HD 150Q) were maintained in the same medium containing 0.4 mg/ml Zeocin and 0.4 mg/ml G418. One day prior to transfection, cells were plated into 6-well tissue-cultured plates at a subconfluent density. Cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. Transfection efficiency was ∼80–90%. After 24 or 48 h of transfection, cells were used for immunofluorescence staining, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting. For cell viability assay, cells were first transfected with different expression plasmids. Twelve hours later, cells were harvested and replated into 96-well plates (5 × 103 cells/well). The cells were then differentiated with 5 mm dbcAMP and induced with 1 μm ponasterone A for 3 days. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay as described previously (12Wang G.H. Mitsui K. Kotliarova S.E. Yamashita A. Nagao Y. Tokuhiro S. Iwatsubo T. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Aggregate formation was manually counted under a fluorescence microscope (∼500 transfected cells in each case), and the cells containing more than one aggregate were considered to have a single aggregate. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Experiment—After 24 or 48 h of transfection, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed on ice for 30 min with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 0.1 mm Na2VO5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml Aprotinin). Cell lysates were briefly sonicated, centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants (total soluble extract) were used for immunoprecipitation as described earlier (9Jana N.R. Tanaka M. Wang G. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2009-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). For each immunoprecipitation experiment, 200 μg of protein in 0.2 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer was incubated either with 5 μl (2 μg) of GFP antibody or 4 μl (2 μg) of normal mouse IgG. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads with SDS (1×) sample buffer, vortexed, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by immunoblotting according to the procedure described earlier (9Jana N.R. Tanaka M. Wang G. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2009-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Blot detection was carried out with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent. All primary antibodies were used in 1:1000 dilutions for immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence Techniques—Cells grown in chamber slides or in 6-well tissue cultured plates were transiently transfected with different constructs. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, washed extensively, then blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween) for 1 h. Primary antibody (anti-v5, 1:5000 dilutions) incubation was carried out overnight at 4 °C. After several washings with TBST, cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500 dilutions) for 1 h, washed several times, and mounted in antifade solution. Samples were observed using a confocal microscope (Fluoview, Olympus), and digital images were assembled using Adobe Photoshop. Degradation Assay—Neuro2a cells were plated in a 6-well tissue-cultured plate, and on the following day, cells were transiently transfected with full-length ataxin-3 with 20Q and 130Q with or without CHIP. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were chased with 10 μg/ml of cycloheximide for different time periods. Cells collected at each time point were then processed for immunoblotting by anti-GFP. Misfolded Truncated N-terminal Huntingtin or Ataxin-3 Are Ubiquitinated—We developed several stable neuro2a cell lines in an inducible system, that express tNhtt with normal (16Q) and expanded polyglutamine (150Q) (12Wang G.H. Mitsui K. Kotliarova S.E. Yamashita A. Nagao Y. Tokuhiro S. Iwatsubo T. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These cell lines were named HD 16Q and HD 150Q, and their corresponding expressed proteins were named tNhtt-16Q and tNhtt-150Q. The cell lines were induced for 1 day with ponasterone A (1 μm) and then processed for immunoprecipitation by anti-GFP. In another experiment, we transfected the truncated ataxin-3 constructs to the neuro2a cell, and after 1 day, cells were collected and processed for immunoprecipitation by GFP antibody. Blots were sequentially probed with anti-ubiquitin and anti-GFP. As shown in Fig. 1A, truncated huntingtin with 150Q proteins or the truncated ataxin-3 with 80Q proteins were ubiquitinated, whereas those truncated proteins with normal glutamine repeats were not ubiquitinated. Fig. 1B showed the same blot as those in A after probing with GFP antibody. The tNhtt-150Q appeared as multiple bands because of the instability of the CAG repeats. CHIP Interacts with the Polyglutamine-expanded Truncated N-terminal Huntingtin or Ataxin-3—Because misfolding promotes the ubiquitination of the expanded polyglutamine proteins, we next wanted to know the identity of the ubiquitin ligase that is responsible for the misfolding-dependent ubiquitination. We first tested the possibility of CHIP ubiquitin ligase, because recently, CHIP has been shown to be responsible for the ubiquitination and degradation of the misfolded proteins. CHIP was transiently transfected into HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells, the cells were induced with ponasterone A for 1 day, and then the cell lysates were processed for immunoprecipitation by anti-GFP. In a similar experiment, CHIP was co-transfected along with a different truncated ataxin-3 construct, and then the cell lysates were processed for immunoprecipitation. In both experiments, blots were detected with anti-v5 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, A and C, CHIP was immunoprecipitated with the truncated N-terminal huntingtin with 150Q and truncated ataxin-3 with 80Q but not the truncated N-terminal huntingtin with 16Q or truncated ataxin-3 with 20Q. Fig. 2, B and D showed the same blot as in Fig. 2, A and C, respectively, after detection with anti-GFP. Association of CHIP with Polyglutamine Aggregates—Next we checked the normal distribution and recruitment of CHIP to the polyglutamine aggregates. First we transiently transfected the CHIP into the HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells, and then the cells were induced to express the truncated huntingtin proteins. After 1 day of induction, cells were processed for immunofluorescence experiments using anti-v5 antibody. CHIP was normally localized into the cytosolic compartment in the wild type neuro2a cells or in the uninduced HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells (Fig. 3). Induction of the expression of the tNhtt-16Q protein did not alter the localization pattern of CHIP in the HD 16Q cell; however, the induction of tNhtt-150Q protein in the HD 150Q cell caused the recruitment of CHIP to the aggregates (Fig. 3). Next, we tested the similar redistribution of CHIP in the ataxin-3 aggregates. CHIP was co-transfected along with truncated ataxin-3 constructs and after 2 days of transfection, cells were processed for immunofluorescence experiments. As expected, CHIP was also recruited to truncated ataxin-3 aggregates (Fig. 4).Fig. 4CHIP associates with the ataxin-3 aggregates. The neuro2a cells were sequentially transfected with CHIP and truncated ataxin-3-EGFP fusion constructs containing 20Q (A–C) and 80Q (D–F). Forty-eight hours later, cells were processed for immunofluorescence staining using v5 antibody. Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody was used to stain the CHIP. Arrows indicate the recruitment of CHIP to the ataxin-3 aggregates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CHIP Enhances the Ubiquitination of Polyglutamine-expanded Truncated N-terminal Huntingtin or Ataxin-3—Because CHIP co-immunoprecipitates with expanded polyglutamine proteins and recruits the polyglutamine aggregates, we further tested its possible involvement in the ubiquitination of the expanded polyglutamine proteins. To test this hypothesis, we transfected CHIP (both full-length and U-box-deleted) to the HD 150Q cells, or co-transfected CHIP along with truncated ataxin-3 constructs. The cell lysate were then made and processed for immunoprecipitation by anti-GFP. Fig. 5 showed that CHIP enhanced the rate of ubiquitination of both truncated N-terminal huntingtin containing 150Q (Fig. 5A, top blot) as well as truncated ataxin-3 with 80Q (Fig. 5B, top blot). This enhanced rate of ubiquitination was prevented by the deletion of U-box of CHIP. The bottom blots of both Fig. 5, A and B are the same blots as the top blots, respectively, but probed with anti-GFP. Anti-GFP also detected smears of ubiquitinated derivatives of expanded polyglutamine proteins in the only CHIP-transfected cell lysate. The lactacystin-treated cell lysate was used as positive control to compare the CHIP-induced ubiquitination profile (Fig. 5A, first two lanes). Because the deletion of U-box of CHIP reduced the rate of ubiquitination, we further tested whether the U-box-deleted CHIP still associates with the polyglutamine aggregates. As shown in Fig. 6, U-box deleted CHIP also recruits to the huntingtin aggregates. We have also observed the association of U-box-deleted CHIP with the ataxin-3 aggregates (data not shown). Result strongly indicates that the CHIP associates with the expanded polyglutamine protein through its interaction with Hsc70.Fig. 6Association of U-box-deleted CHIP with the huntingtin aggregates. The HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells were transiently transfected with U-box-deleted CHIP and induced in a similar way as described in the Fig. 2. Cells were then subjected to immunofluorescence staining with anti-v5. Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody was used to stain the CHIP. Arrows indicate the recruitment of U-box deleted CHIP to the huntingtin aggregates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CHIP Enhances the Degradation of Polyglutamine-expanded Proteins—Because CHIP enhanced the ubiquitination of polyglutamine-expanded proteins; we further checked their rate of degradation upon CHIP overexpression. For this experiment, we used full-length ataxin-3 with 20Q and 130Q, because full-length ataxin-3 with 130Q forms very few aggregates (∼5–10% cells form aggregates) after 48 h of transfection. Neuro2a cells were transiently transfected with ataxin-3 constructs either alone or along with CHIP. Twenty-four hours later, cells were chased with cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, full-length ataxin-3 with 20Q is not degraded; however, full-length ataxin-3 with 130Q is degraded after 1.5, 5, and 10 h of chase. Overexpression of CHIP enhanced the degradation of full-length ataxin-3 with 130Q. Overexpression of CHIP also slightly enhanced the degradation of ataxin-3 with 20Q (Fig. 7, A and B). Fig. 7C demonstrated that full-length ataxin-3 with 130Q was ubiquitinated, and CHIP overexpression enhanced the rate of ubiquitination. CHIP Decreases the Aggregation and Cell Death Mediated by the Expanded Polyglutamine Proteins—Because CHIP promotes the ubiquitination of expanded polyglutamine proteins, we expected that its overexpression would increase the rate of degradation of expanded polyglutamine proteins by proteasomes. If so, CHIP should decrease the aggregation of polyglutamine proteins. Therefore, we next checked the effect of CHIP on the rate of aggregate formation and cell viability in the HD 150Q cells after different days of transfection. As shown in Fig. 8A, overexpression of CHIP reduced the polyglutamine-expanded tNhtt aggregation, and the suppressive effect is more prominent when the CHIP is overexpressed along with Hsc70. The deletion of the U-box of the CHIP abolished the suppressive effect on aggregation. CHIP overexpression also decreased the aggregation of truncated ataxin-3 with 80Q (data not shown). This inhibitory effect of CHIP on aggregate formation was prevented by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. CHIP was also able to protect the polyglutamine protein-induced cell death, and again, the protective effect was more when the CHIP was overexpressed along with Hsc70 (Fig. 8B). Ubiquitin is a well known marker of polyglutamine aggregates, but how and when polyglutamine aggregates are ubiquitinated is not yet known. The most likely hypothesis is that the expanded polyglutamine proteins are misfolded, and failure to refold might cause their ubiquitination before they are degraded by proteasome. Here we first demonstrated that the expanded polyglutamine proteins that are misfolded became ubiquitinated. Secondly, we identified CHIP ubiquitin ligase that is responsible for the misfolding-dependent ubiquitination of the expanded polyglutamine proteins. Finally, we showed that overexpression of CHIP reduces the aggregate formation and cell death mediated by expanded polyglutamine proteins. Ubiquitination begins with the ATP-dependent activation of ubiquitin by an activating enzyme (E1). The ligation of ubiquitin to the substrate is then carried out by a specific complex composed of an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) (14Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). The question now is how the misfolded polyglutamine protein is recognized by the ubiquitination machine and whether chaperones play any role. The expanded polyglutamine protein has been shown earlier to specifically interact with Hsc70/Hsp70 chaperones (9Jana N.R. Tanaka M. Wang G. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2009-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and now we have shown that CHIP associates and ubiquitinates expanded polyglutamine proteins. Results suggest that the Hsc70/Hsp70 and CHIP both play a critical role in the process of ubiquitination of polyglutamine proteins. CHIP was first identified as an interacting protein with the C terminus of Hsp70 and shown to negatively regulated Hsp70 chaperone activity (15Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Subsequently, CHIP was demonstrated to be a ubiquitin ligase of the U-box family (16Jiang J.

Recent reports also demonstrated that CHIP is responsible for the misfolding-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (18Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), glucocorticoid receptor (19Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J.

Kim J. Dillman W.H. Browne S.E. Hall A. Voellmy R. Tsuboi Y. Dawson T.M. Wolozin B. Hardy J.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 23Hatakeyama S.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). We have also observed that the overexpression of CHIP inhibits polyglutamine protein aggregation and cell death and that the inhibitory effects are more prominent when CHIP is expressed along with the Hsc70 chaperone. The results suggests that polyglutamine proteins are degraded by proteasomes after they are ubiquitinated by CHIP and that the removal of polyglutamine proteins protects cells from their toxic effect. Others have reported similar findings (20Choi J.S. Cho S. Park S.G. Park B.C. Lee D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 574-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Urushitani M.

Neurochem. 2004; 91: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) where they have shown that overexpression of CHIP reduced the aggregation and cell death mediated by mutant copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 or Tau protein. However, there are reports suggesting that the expanded polyglutamine proteins are not degraded efficiently by the proteasome and that also there is proteasomal malfunction in the expanded polyglutamine protein-expressing cells (11Jana N.R. Zemskov E.A. Wang G. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 26Holmberg C.I. Staniszewski K.E. Mensah K.N. Matouschek A. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 307-318Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In both the cases, there could be an increased accumulation of ubiquitinated derivatives of expanded polyglutamine proteins. CHIP along with Hsc70 might enhance the rate of degradation by increasing the ubiquitination rate. Overexpression of CHIP along with Hsc70 could also conceivably have recovered proteasomal malfunction by reducing the burden of aggregated polyglutamine proteins as well as other misfolded proteins. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the CHIP along with Hsc70 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of expanded polyglutamine proteins that ultimately leads to the suppression of aggregation and cell death."

This process is characterized by a strong interdependence of cell shape, cytoskeletal organization, and the onset of chondrogenic gene expression, but the molecular mechanisms mediating these interactions are not known. Here we investigated the role of the RhoA/ROCK pathway, a well characterized regulator of cytoskeletal organization, in chondrogenesis. We show that pharmacological inhibition of ROCK signaling by Y27632 resulted in increased glycosaminoglycan synthesis and elevated expression of the chondrogenic transcription factor Sox9, whereas overexpression of RhoA in the chondrogenic cell line ATDC5 had the opposite effects. Suppression of Sox9 expression by ROCK signaling was achieved through repression of Sox9 promoter activity. These molecular changes were accompanied by reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, where RhoA/ROCK signaling suppressed cortical actin organization, a hallmark of differentiated chondrocytes. This led us to analyze the regulation of Sox9 expression by drugs affecting cytoskeletal dynamics. Both inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasin D and stabilization of existing actin filaments by jasplakinolide resulted in increased Sox9 mRNA levels, whereas inhibition of microtubule polymerization by colchicine completely blocked Sox9 expression. In conclusion, our data suggest that RhoA/ROCK signaling suppresses chondrogenesis through the control of Sox9 expression and actin organization.

During development, most of our bones form through endochondral ossification in which bones are first laid down as cartilage precursors (1Karsenty G. Wagner E.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 389-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 2Shum L. Nuckolls G. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: 94-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this process, cartilage serves as a template for subsequent bone formation and controls bone growth through the coordinated proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes in the growth plate. In the adult, chondrocytes are the sole cell type of articular cartilage and play crucial roles in joint function (3Aigner T. McKenna L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 5-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 4Sandell L.J. Aigner T. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Disruption of chondrocyte function in either context results in severe consequences for affected individuals (4Sandell L.J. Aigner T. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 5Kornak U. Mundlos S. Am. J. Hum.

Deregulated proliferation or differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes (e.g. through gene mutations, hormonal disorders, or medication) commonly results in skeletal deformities and growth retardation (7Ballock R.T. O'Keefe R.J. Birth Defects Res. Part C Embryo Today. 2003; 69: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8van der Eerden B.C.J. Karperien M. Wit J.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 782-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), whereas loss of articular chondrocyte function is a major contributing factor in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (9Malemud C.J. Islam N. Haqqi T.M. Cells Tissues Organs. 2003; 174: 34-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 10Aigner T. Kurz B. Fukui N. Sandell L. Curr. Opin.

Despite some clear differences, growth plate and articular chondrocytes share several common features. Extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen II and aggrecan are among the cartilage markers produced by both cell types (12Sandell L.J. Adler P. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 731-742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Iwamoto M. Higuchi Y. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Kurisu K. Koyama E. Yeh H. Rosenbloom J. Pacifici M. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: S41-S47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The transcription factor Sox9 has been shown to be required for chondrocyte formation (chondrogenesis) and to directly regulate transcription of the collagen II gene, in conjunction with the related Sox5 and Sox6 genes (14Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 15Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol.

Another common feature of all chondrocytes is the interdependence of cell shape and differentiation status (17Dessau W. Vertel B.M. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18von der Mark K. Gauss V. von der Mark H. Muller P.

Med. 1983; 172: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Chondrogenesis is characterized by drastic changes in cell shape from a fibroblastoid to a round or polygonal morphology (21von der Mark K. von der Mark H. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 73: 736-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This transition is accompanied by changes in gene expression and reverted when chondrocytes dedifferentiate, for example in osteoarthritis and in monolayer culture in vitro (4Sandell L.J. Aigner T. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 22Schnabel M. Marlovits S. Eckhoff G. Fichtel I. Gotzen L. Vecsei V. Schlegel J. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2002; 10: 62-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms responsible for this interplay are largely unknown, but the actin cytoskeleton appears to play important roles in this context (23Kim S.-J. Hwang S.-G. Kim I.-C. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42448-42456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24Mallein-Gerin F. Garrone R. van der Rest M. Eur. J.

Chondrocytes display mostly cortical organization of their actin filaments in vivo and in vitro, whereas precursor cells or dedifferentiated chondrocytes are characterized by a more fibrillar organization (26Langelier E. Suetterlin R. Hoemann C.D. Aebi U. Buschmann M.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1307-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27Idowu B.D. Knight M.M. Bader D.L. Lee D.A. Histochem.

Moreover, inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasin B has been shown to induce redifferentiation of dedifferentiated chicken chondrocytes (30Benya P.D. Brown P.D. Padilla S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 31Brown P.D. Benya P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 32Benya P.D.

Forest N. Boulekbache H. Sautier J.M. Biol. Cell. 1995; 83: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the pathways controlling the organization of the chondrocyte actin network could also play major roles in regulating chondrocyte differentiation and function. Rho GTPases are the best characterized upstream regulators of the actin cytoskeleton (35Aspenstrom P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 36Hall A. Nobes C.D. Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 965-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Through a multitude of downstream effectors, they control not only cytoskeletal organization but also many other cellular functions such as transcription, cell cycle progression, and vesicle trafficking (37Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 38Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar, 39Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The kinases ROCK I and ROCK II are among the most important effectors of the prototype GTPase RhoA (40Amano M. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 41Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that RhoA/ROCK signaling supports proliferation of established chondrocytes and inhibits hypertrophic differentiation (42Wang G. Woods A. Sabari S. Pagnotta L. Stanton L.-A. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13205-13214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but roles of this pathway in the early steps of chondrogenic differentiation (e.g. the transition from mesenchymal precursor cells to chondrocytes) have not been investigated. However, important roles of RhoA in the commitment and differentiation of precursor cells into other mesenchymal lineages such as adipocytes, myoblasts, and osteoblasts have been reported recently (43McBeath R. Pirone D.M. Nelson C.M. Bhadriraju K. Chen C.S. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3303) Google Scholar, 44Sordella R. Jiang W. Chen G.C. Curto M. Settleman J.

This study addresses the roles of RhoA/ROCK signaling and cytoskeletal components in the induction of the chondrogenic phenotype in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. Materials—Timed pregnant CD1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. All of the cell culture medium components were from Invitrogen or Sigma unless stated otherwise. All of the inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem or Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade from commercial suppliers. The pRlCMV plasmid was from Promega, and the serum response factor (SRF) 1The abbreviations used are: SRF, serum response factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. reporter plasmid was purchased from Stratagene. Antibodies against ROCK I (catalogue number Sc-5560) and ROCK II (Sc-5561) were from Santa Cruz, and the β-actin antibody (A-544) was from Sigma. A plasmid containing the proximal 2 kb of the mouse Sox9 promoter controlling expression of firefly luciferase was provided by Dr. M. Underhill (University of British Columbia). Micromass Culture and ATDC5 Cell Culture—Mesenchymal limb buds cells were obtained from mice at 11.5 days post coitum and cultured in micromass cultures as described (45Stanton L.A. Sabari S. Sampaio A.V. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 46Ahrens P.B. Solursh M. Reiter R.S. Dev. Biol. 1977; 60: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were suspended in 60% Ham's F-12 medium, 40% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 0.25% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.25% l-glutamine at a density of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml and plated in 10-μl droplets to simulate the high density of chondrogenic condensations. One hour after plating, medium (as above, supplemented with 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate and 50 μg/ml of ascorbic acid) was added to the cultures. As indicated, the medium is supplemented with Me2SO, 10 μm Y27632 (dissolved in Me2SO), 3 μm cytochalasin D (dissolved in Me2SO), 50 nm jasplakinolide (dissolved in Me2SO), or 1 μm colchicine (dissolved in water). Medium and inhibitors were changed every 24 h until harvesting. For confocal microscopy, the micromass cultures were plated on glass coverslips and cultured as above. After 1 day in culture, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, followed by two 10-min washes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The membranes were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS solution for 5 min and washed twice for 5 min with PBS. The cells were then incubated in the dark for 50 min at room temperature with 2.5 units/PBS rhodamine phalloidin and mounted with Vectashield® (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The images were taken using a Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal microscope with 40-fold magnification and analyzed using LSM-10 software. RhoA- and pcDNA3 vector-transfected ATDC5 cells were cultured and induced to differentiate as described (42Wang G. Woods A. Sabari S. Pagnotta L. Stanton L.-A. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13205-13214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcriptase and Real Time PCR—RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. 500 ng of collected RNA is reverse transcribed using both random hexamers, pd (N)6 and poly(dt) (Amersham Biosciences). Specific primers were designed for β-actin (as described by Stanton et al. (45Stanton L.A. Sabari S. Sampaio A.V. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)), ROCK I (forward primer, 5′-TTCATGTCCGACCTGTAACC-3′; reverse primer; 5′-TTGACAGCGTTCGAGGAGAG-3′), and ROCK II (forward primer, 5′-TTCACGTCCGACCTGTTACC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTGGCACCTACGGCACTCTA-3′) producing amplicons of 480 and 275 base pairs, respectively. The initial denaturation was done at 95 °C for 60–90 s, and annealing was done at 65 and 52 °C for 30–75 s with 30 cycles of amplification for both. Non-reverse transcribed RNA served as the negative control. 25 ng of collected RNA was used for real time PCR. Relative gene expression was determined by measuring Sox9 (forward primer, 5′-CATCACCCGCTCGCAATAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCGGCTGCGTGACTGTAGTA-3′; and probe, 6FAM-5′-ACCATCAGAACTCCGGCT-MGBNFQ-3 relative to 18 S rRNA and/or GAPDH, using Taqman One step Master Mix and 40 cycles on the ABI Prism 7900 HT sequence detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Western Blot Analysis—Protein was isolated from treated micromass cultures on days 1–4. The cells were collected in cold PBS and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mini-complete tablet (Roche Applied Science), 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm NaVO3) and stored at -20 °C. Samples were then sonicated for 5 s at an amplitude of 20% and quantified by BCA (Sigma) as described by the manufacturer's protocol. Using the Bio-Rad mini-blot apparatus, 40 μg of total protein was loaded per well with 6× dithiothreitol sample buffer and run for 1.5 h. Protein was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schull) and blocked for 2 h in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with 0.01% Tween 20. One μg/ml of primary antibody of ROCK I, ROCK II, or actin was incubated overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with a 5000× dilution of the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Signal was detected using ECL™ Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol and visualized on ChemiImager™ 5500 (AlphaInnotech Inc.). Alcian Blue Stain—Treated micromass cultures were fixed after 2, 3, or 4 days in culture in 100% ethanol for 20 min at -20 °C and then incubated with 0.1% HCl-Alcian blue for 2 h (45Stanton L.A. Sabari S. Sampaio A.V. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Excess stain was washed off with double distilled water, and pictures were taken. The stain was quantified by solubilizing the stain in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for 8 h at room temperature. Absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer at 620 nm. Nodule number was assessed through manual counting by an independent observer unaware of experimental conditions. Isolation of Primary Chondrocytes—Primary chondrocytes were isolated from tibias of day 15.5 timed mouse embryos. Tibias were isolated and digested for 15 min at 37 °C with trypsin, followed by a 2-h digestion in 3 mg/ml collagenase P (Roche Applied Science) dissolved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh primary culture media (60:40 Ham's F-12 medium/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum, supplemented with l-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin). 40,000 cells/well were plated on glass coverslips in a 24-well Corning tissue culture plate. After 24 h, the cells were treated with Me2SO control or 10 μm Y27632 for 3 h. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (at room temperature for 10 min, followed by two 10-min washes in PBS. The membranes were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS solution for 5 min and washed twice for 5 min with PBS. The cells were then incubated in the dark for 50 min at room temperature with 2.5 units/PBS rhodamine phalloidin and mounted with Vectashield® and 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). The images were taken using a Leica DMRA2 fluorescence microscope with 40-fold magnification and analyzed using OpenLab 3.1 software. Transfections and Luciferase Assays—The cells for micromass cultures were transiently transfected in suspension prior to plating with a 1:1 ratio of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and 0.5 μg of a plasmid containing either a SRF-responsive promoter (Stratagene) or the 2-kb proximal promoter of the mouse Sox9 gene linked to the firefly luciferase gene. The cells were always cotransfected with a control plasmid containing the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (Promega) to standardize for transfection efficiency. Transfected cells were then plated in 10-μl droplets as micromass cultures as described above and treated with inhibitors 1 h after plating. Three days after transfections, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (Promega) for 20 min at room temperature. 20 μl of lysate were used to determine relative luciferase activity (firefly luciferase activity divided by Renilla luciferase activity) using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Data analyses were done as described previously (47Halawani D. Mondeh R. Stanton L.A. Beier F. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3726-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data collected from real time PCR are represented as the averages of three independent experiments (e.g. three independent isolations of primary cells) run in triplicate. The means were quantified relative to 18 S rRNA and/or GAPDH, and the data were normalized to day 1 of control treated RNA/trial. Alcian blue quantification and nodule counting was an average of three to four independent cell isolations of two replicates/treatment/time point. The data of luciferase activity represent an average of four independent cell isolations, each performed in quadruplicate. Statistical significance was determined with one-way or two-way analysis of variance followed by a post-hoc Bonferroni test using GraphPad Prism software. ROCK I/II Are Expressed during Chondrogenesis—Although we had earlier demonstrated expression of ROCK I/II in chondrocytes (42Wang G. Woods A. Sabari S. Pagnotta L. Stanton L.-A. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13205-13214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), no data on temporal profiles of their expression during early chondrogenesis are available. We first examined the expression of both ROCK I and II in our micromass cultures. Transcripts were detected with the expected amplicon sizes of 480 and 275 base pairs for ROCK I and II, respectively, throughout the micromass culture period from days 1 to 4 (Fig. 1a). Expression of both kinases was also demonstrated at the protein level by Western blot analyses (Fig. 1b). No obvious changes in ROCK I and II mRNA or protein levels were observed during chondrogenesis. ROCK Suppresses Glycosaminoglycan Production—We next asked whether inhibition of ROCK signaling would interfere with chondrogenesis by analyzing the effects of the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (10 μm) on Alcian blue staining. Alcian blue stains for glycosaminoglycans and is therefore an established maker of chondrogenesis. Alcian blue staining increased over time in micromass culture, indicating advanced chondrogenic differentiation. ROCK inhibition did not affect glycosaminoglycan production at days 2 or 3 or micromass culture but resulted in a visible increase in Alcian blue staining by day 4 of micromass culture (Fig. 2a). Stimulation of glycosaminoglycan production by Y27632 at day 4 was confirmed quantitatively by dye extraction and measurement of absorbance (Fig. 2b). However, the number of Alcian blue-stained nodules at this time point was not affected by Y27632 (Fig. 2c). The size of these nodules also does not appear to change between the control and treated cultures. These data suggest that ROCK inhibition does not affect cell condensation but results in increased chondrogenic differentiation and chondrocyte-specific extracellular matrix synthesis of mesenchymal precursor cells within nodules. ROCK Inhibition Induces Cortical Actin Morphology—We next asked whether the effects on glycosaminoglycan synthesis are accompanied by chondrocyte-specific changes in cellular morphology and actin organization. Primary chondrocytes in monolayer culture rapidly lost their rounded morphology and developed a fibroblastoid cell shape with extensive stress fibers (Fig. 3a). Treatment with Y27632 caused reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton to a cortical pattern with parallel rounding of cells, suggesting that ROCK inhibition supports the establishment of a chondrocyte-specific cell shape and actin organization. Similar mechanisms were observed in three-dimensional micromass cultures by confocal microscopy; cultures treated with Y27632 displayed increased cell rounding and a reduced number of actin fibers (Fig. 3, b and c). RhoA Overexpression Suppresses Glycosaminoglycan Synthesis and Induces Stress Fiber Formation in Chondrogenic Cells—RhoA is an upstream activator of ROCK I/II and requires ROCK activity for its effects in later stages of chondrogenic differentiation (42Wang G. Woods A. Sabari S. Pagnotta L. Stanton L.-A. Beier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13205-13214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether RhoA regulates chondrogenesis in a fashion similar to that of ROCK kinases. Overexpression of RhoA in the chondrogenic cell line ATDC5 resulted in reduced Alcian blue staining (Fig. 4a). These effects were reversed by treatment with Y27632. RhoA overexpression in ATDC5 cells also caused cell elongation and formation of stress fibers when compared with vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 4b). ROCK inhibition with Y27632 rescued this effect. These data demonstrate that RhoA suppresses chondrogenic differentiation through a ROCK I/II-dependent mechanism. RhoA/ROCK Signaling Inhibits Sox9 Expression during Chondrogenesis—We next asked whether changes in actin organization and glycosaminoglycan expression are accompanied by alteration of chondrogenic gene expression by investigating Sox9 mRNA expression. Similar to Alcian blue staining, Sox9 mRNA levels increased markedly after 2 days of micromass culture. Although Sox9 mRNA levels were similar in Y27632-treated and control cultures until day 2, real time PCR analysis showed that ROCK inhibition greatly reduces the increase in Sox9 expression on days 3 and 4 (Fig. 5a). RhoA overexpression in the ATDC5 cell line caused a 50% reduction in Sox9 mRNA levels. This effect is rescued by the addition of Y27632 (Fig. 5b). We examined the effects of Y27632 on the activity of a 2-kb fragment of the mouse Sox9 promoter. ROCK inhibition caused a 2-fold induction of this promoter fragment in micromass cultures, suggesting that ROCK signaling controls Sox9 mRNA levels through transcriptional mechanisms (Fig. 5c). Manipulation of Actin Polymerization Regulates Sox9 mRNA Levels—Our data had shown regulation of chondrocyte actin organization and Sox9 expression by the RhoA/ROCK pathway. Previous studies had demonstrated that inhibition of actin polymerization induces a chondrogenic phenotype (30Benya P.D. Brown P.D. Padilla S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 31Brown P.D. Benya P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 33Benya P.D. Pathol. Immunopathol. Res. 1988; 7: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but the molecular mechanism involved had not been described. To clarify whether Sox9 expression is regulated directly by the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, we examined the effects of different drugs that modulate actin remodeling. Cytochalasin D binds monomeric actin and therefore inhibits actin polymerization. In contrast, jasplakinolide binds polymerized actin, thereby stabilizing existing filaments and nucleating new actin polymerization. Jasplakinolide treatment caused a significant increase in Sox9 transcript levels at days 3 and 4, whereas cytochalasin D enhanced Sox9 expression by day 4 (Fig. 6a). These data demonstrate that actin dynamics control Sox9 expression and suggest that remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton could contribute to the effects of RhoA/ROCK signaling on chondrogenesis. Rho GTPases regulate not only actin organization but also the microtubule component of the cytoskeleton (48Hollenbeck P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R820-R823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of colchicine, an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization, on Sox9 expression in micromass cultures. Colchicine treatment blocked Sox9 expression at all time points (Fig. 6b) and also completely inhibited Alcian blue staining (data not shown). These data show that microtubule polymerization is absolutely required for chondrogenesis to occur, in agreement with earlier studies that have shown reduced glycosaminoglycan and proteoglycan production in colchicine-treated chondrocytes (49Takigawa M. Takano T. Shirai E. Suzuki F. Cell Differ. 1984; 14: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 50Madsen K. Moskalewski S. Thyberg J. Friberg U. Experientia. 1979; 35: 1572-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Effects of Cytoskeletal Modifications on Serum Response Factor Activity—Previous publications have described a role of the transcription factor SRF in transcriptional response to cytoskeletal modifications and Rho signaling (51Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar, 52Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R.

https://openalex.org/W2013873946,"Increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels have been found with age and are connected to muscle atrophy and cell loss, yet the signaling events that occur in vivo are unknown. Calorie restriction (CR), a robust intervention shown to repeatedly evade the physiological declines associated with aging, has been reported to reduce TNF-alpha and may assist in understanding the mechanisms of muscle sarcopenia. The effects of age and CR on muscle mass, myocyte area, fiber number, myocyte TNF-alpha expression, plasma TNF-alpha levels, and specific elements linked with the TNF-alpha signaling cascade (TNF-R1, IKKgamma, IkappaBalpha, p65, NF-kappaB binding activity, FADD, caspase-8, and DNA fragmentation) were investigated in soleus (predominately Type I fiber), and superficial vastus lateralis (SVL, predominately Type II fiber), of 6-month-old ad libitum fed (6AL), 26-month-old ad libitum fed (26AL), and 26-month-old calorie-restricted (26CR) male Fischer 344 rats (CR = 40% restriction compared with ad libitum). Plasma TNF-alpha was increased with age, and the age-associated rise was attenuated with life-long CR. In soleus muscle, we reported a greater capacity to cultivate inflammatory signaling through the transcription factor NF-kappaB compared with that detected in SVL with age. In contrast, in the SVL TNF-alpha stimulated apoptotic signaling with age to a much higher extent than was observed in the soleus. Moreover, a reduction in muscle mass, cross-sectional area, and fiber number in the SVL coincided with this age-linked elevation in apoptosis. In agreement with CR's ability, TNF-alpha stimulation of both inflammatory and apoptotic pathways were abrogated. Our results suggest that TNF-alpha signals transmitted to specific fiber types determine the decision of selecting life or death signaling pathways and are linked to the extent of fiber loss experienced in the aging muscle. Such a specific potential may constitute a major proponent in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia."
https://openalex.org/W2149729810,"Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD), an enzyme present in neuronal mitochondria, is a cofactor facilitating Abeta-induced cell stress. We hypothesized that ABAD provides a direct link between Abeta and cytotoxicity via mitochondrial oxidant stress. Neurons cultured from transgenic (Tg) mice with targeted overexpression of a mutant form of amyloid precursor protein and ABAD (Tg mAPP/ABAD) displayed spontaneous generation of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion, and decreased ATP, as well as subsequent release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and induction of caspase-3-like activity followed by DNA fragmentation and loss of cell viability. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was associated with dysfunction at the level of mitochondrial complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase, or COX). In neurons cultured from Tg mAPP/ABAD mice, COX activity was selectively decreased, and cyanide, an inhibitor of complex IV, exacerbated leakage of ROS, induction of caspase-3-like activity, and DNA fragmentation. In vivo, Tg mAPP/ABAD mice displayed reduced levels of brain ATP and COX activity, diminished glucose utilization, as well as electrophysiological abnormalities in hippocampal slices compared with Tg mAPP mice. In contrast, neither Tg ABAD mice nor nontransgenic (non-TG) littermates showed similar changes in ATP, COX activity, glucose utilization or electrophysiological properties. Each of the genotypes (Tg ABAD, Tg mAPP and Tg mAPP/ABAD mice, and non-TG littermates) displayed normal reproductive fitness, development and lifespan (1) These findings link ABAD-induced oxidant stress to critical aspects of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated cellular dysfunction, suggesting a pivotal role for this enzyme in the pathogenesis of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2098429613,"Several lines of clinical and experimental evidence suggest an important role of the renin-angiotensin system in ischemic brain injury although the cellular regulation of the angiotensin AT1 and AT2 receptors and their potential relevance in this condition have not yet been clearly defined. We first assessed the regulation of brain AT1 and AT2 receptors in response to transient unilateral medial cerebral artery occlusion in rats by real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence labeling. AT2 receptors in the peri-infarct zone were significantly upregulated 2 days after transient focal cerebral ischemia. Increased AT2 receptors, which were abundantly distributed in a large number of brain regions adjacent to the infarct area including cerebral frontal cortex, piriform cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, were exclusively expressed in neurons. By contrast, AT1 receptors, which remained unaltered, were mainly expressed in astrocytes. In neurons of ischemic striatum, increased AT2 receptors were associated with intense neurite outgrowth. Blockade of central AT2 receptors with PD123177 abolished the neuroprotective effects of central AT1 receptor blockade with irbesartan on infarct size and neurological outcome. In primary cortical neurons, stimulation of AT2 receptors supported neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth. Our data indicate that cerebral AT2 receptors exert neuroprotective actions in response to ischemia-induced neuronal injury, possibly by supporting neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth in peri-ischemic brain areas."
https://openalex.org/W2008986362,"Glucose toxicity in pancreatic islet beta cells causes loss of insulin gene expression, content, and secretion due to loss of binding of transcription factors, most notably PDX-1 and RIPE-3b1 activator, to the promoter region of the insulin gene. Recently, RIPE-3b1 activator was cloned and identified as the mammalian homologue of avian MafA/Maf-L (MafA). This enabled us to carry out more extensive studies of the role of MafA in glucotoxicity than were hitherto possible. Northern analysis of glucotoxic HIT-T15 cells revealed normal amounts of MafA mRNA, but Western analysis demonstrated a 97 ± 1% reduction in MafA protein (p < 0.0001). The proteasome is a likely site for MafA degradation as lactacystin, an irreversible proteasome inhibitor, caused an accumulation of MafA protein. Antioxidants have previously been shown to prevent the adverse effects of glucose toxicity on beta cell function both in vivo and in vitro.In the current study, chronic culturing of HIT-T15 cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevented loss of MafA protein (late passage = 18.9 ± 10.4% of early passage, p < 0.001; late passage with NAC = 68.7 ± 19.7% of early passage, p = not significant) and loss of DNA binding (late passage = 63.7 ± 9% of early passage, p < 0.02; late passage with NAC = 116 ± 10% of early passage, p = not significant). Additionally, transient transfection of PDX-1 or MafA cDNA into glucotoxic cells increased PDX-1 and MafA protein levels and individually increased insulin promoter activity (untreated = 34%, PDX-1 = 70%, MafA = 78%; percentage of activity of early passage cells), whereas the combined transfection of MafA and PDX-1 completely restored insulin promoter activity. This recovery of promoter activity following transient transfection had no effect on endogenous insulin mRNA. However, adenoviral infection of MafA and PDX-1 significantly increased endogenous insulin mRNA levels by 93% (121 ± 9 versus 233 ± 18 density light units; n = 5, p < 0.001). We conclude that the absence of MafA protein from beta cells via chronic oxidative stress contributes importantly to the loss of endogenous insulin gene expression as glucose toxicity develops.

We conclude that the absence of MafA protein from beta cells via chronic oxidative stress contributes importantly to the loss of endogenous insulin gene expression as glucose toxicity develops. After the onset of type 2 diabetes, chronic hyperglycemia causes glucotoxic changes in many tissues (1Yki-Jarvinen H. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 415-431PubMed Google Scholar, 2Eizirik D.L. Korbutt G.S.

Glucose toxicity in the pancreatic islet beta cell secondarily leads to further defects in beta cell function, including decreases in insulin reporter activity, gene expression, content, and secretion (3Robertson R.P.

We previously observed that loss of insulin gene expression is accompanied by decreased binding to the promoter region of two important transcription factors, PDX-1 1The abbreviations used are: PDX-1, pancreatic/duodenal homeobox-1; RIPE-3b1, rat insulin promoter element; MafA, mammalian homologue of avian MafA/L-Maf; LUC, luciferase; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; DLU, density light units; GFP, green fluorescent protein; pfu, plaque-forming units; CMV, cytomegalovirus; INS, insulin.1The abbreviations used are: PDX-1, pancreatic/duodenal homeobox-1; RIPE-3b1, rat insulin promoter element; MafA, mammalian homologue of avian MafA/L-Maf; LUC, luciferase; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; DLU, density light units; GFP, green fluorescent protein; pfu, plaque-forming units; CMV, cytomegalovirus; INS, insulin. (STF-1, IDX-1, IPF-1) and RIPE-3b1 activator (6Olson L.K. Redmon J.B. Towle H.C. Robertson R.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 7Poitout V. Olson L.K.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PDX-1 is required for pancreatic development and is a key regulator of insulin gene expression. Mutations within the RIPE-3b1/C1 element of the insulin promoter markedly reduce glucose-responsive insulin gene expression (7Poitout V. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1041-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We also reported that loss of RIPE-3b1 binding precedes the loss of PDX-1 binding to the insulin promoter as glucotoxicity develops (8Harmon J.S. Tanaka Y. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The chronology of these losses is likely to be important in light of a recent report that RIPE-3b1/MafA directly activates PDX-1 transcription (9Samaras S.E. Zhao L. Means A. Henderson E. Matsuoka T.-A. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12263-12270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The work in this study features the use of HIT-T15 cells, a glucose-responsive beta cell line that has proven over the past decade to reproduce the molecular changes in gene expression that are caused by glucose toxicity in vivo in animal models. Since isolated islets cannot be chronically cultured to study the adverse effects of high glucose concentrations over many months, this cell line is a valuable surrogate. In our previous work, reconstitution of late passage glucotoxic HIT-T15 cells by transient transfection with PDX-1 partially restored insulin promoter activity (8Harmon J.S. Tanaka Y. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since RIPE-3b1 had not yet been cloned, we were unable to extend our studies with this transcription factor but hypothesized that reconstitution of the cells with both PDX-1 and RIPE-3b1 activator would lead to greater recovery of insulin promoter activity. With the recent cloning and identification of RIPE-3b1 activator as MafA (10Olbrot M. Rud J. Moss L.G. Sharma A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Culture—HIT-T15 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 11.1 mm glucose as described previously (13Zhang H.-J. Walseth T.F. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were categorized as early passage (p71–75) or late passage (p123–128), with each passage occurring weekly. Chronic culturing of HIT-T15 cells with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (Sigma; 0.5, 1, or 5 mm) added to the media was begun at p70. Western and Northern Blot Analyses—Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Schreiber et al. (14Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar) with buffers containing 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture set II (Calbiochem), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 ng/μl aprotinin, 10 ng/μl leupeptin. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were separated on 10% polyacrylamide Ready gels (Bio-Rad) and electrotransferred onto Trans-blot nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were immunoblotted with mouse MafA antisera (1:10,000) (Bethyl Laboratories) or mouse PDX-1 antisera (1:3000) (gift from Dr. Chris Wright, Vanderbilt University) overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween. The membranes were washed and probed with anti-rabbit IgG (1:4000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. MafA and PDX-1 proteins were detected using the ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-TFIID (N-12) (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to control for protein loading. Peptide neutralization was performed to ensure MafA antibody specificity in HIT-T15 cells (data not shown). Densitometry of autoradiograms was performed using OptiQuant image analysis software (Packard). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). MafA mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis using the NorthernMax system (Ambion) with slight modification to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was electrotransferred to a nylon membrane for 2 h in 1× Tris acetate/EDTA buffer. Prehybridization at 42 °C for 1 h with ULTRAhyb-Oligo (Ambion) was followed by a 16-h hybridization with a γ-32P end-labeled mouse MafA cDNA probe 611CACCACCACGGAGGCTCTGGCCACCACGGCGGAGGCGCGGGTCACGGCGG661. Blots were washed according to manufacturer's instructions. Detection of mRNA levels was performed using the Cyclone storage phosphor system (Packard), and densitometry was performed using the OptiQuant image analysis software (Packard). Immunoprecipitation—Early passage HIT-T15 cells were cultured in RPMI media containing 0.8 mm glucose for 5 days. The cells were then subcultured for 72 h in RPMI media containing either 11.1 or 0.8 mm glucose. Lactacystin (Sigma), at a final concentration of 10 μm, was added during the last 12 h of the subculture period to inhibit proteasome function. Whole cell extracts were obtained by harvesting cells in lysis buffer (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 ng/μl aprotinin, 10 ng/μl leupeptin). Total MafA protein levels were measured by Western blot analysis using 30 μg of protein and immunoblotted as described above. To determine the level of MafA ubiquitination, 500 μg of cellular lysate was diluted in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Immunocomplexes were formed by the addition of 2 μg of MafA antibody with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. These complexes were precipitated with 25 μl of protein G agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The immunocomplexes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to immunoblot analysis on 10% polyacrylamide Ready gels (Bio-Rad). Membranes were immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin (1:1000) (Calbiochem) overnight. Membranes were washed and probed with anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. Detection and densitometry were performed as above. Transient Transfection—HIT-T15 cells were subcultured for 48 h in 12-well culture plates, 0.65 × 106 cells/well. The cells were washed with serum-free media and transfected with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each well contained 800 μl of serum-free media with 5 μg of Lipofectamine reagent, 11.25 μg of Plus reagent (Invitrogen), 0.5 μg of INS-LUC, the human insulin gene sequence –326 to +30 linked to a luciferase reporter gene (gift from Dr. Danielle Melloul, Hadassah University Hospital), 10 ng of pRL-CMV (Promega), and empty CMV4 vector to make the total DNA concentration equivalent among all wells. Some wells also contained PDX-1 cDNA, MafA cDNA, or both. Four hours after transfection, media was replaced with RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested 24–30 h later with passive lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activities were determined using the Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data are expressed as INS-LUC activity (firefly luciferase) divided by pRL-CMV activity (Renilla luciferase) to control for transfection efficiency among the different conditions. Adenovirus Infection—Adenoviruses were obtained from the Pacific Northwest Research Institute Adenoviral Core (provided by Dr. Christopher J. Rhodes). HIT-T15 cells were subcultured for 72 h in 6-well culture plates, 1.25 × 106 cells/well. The cells were washed with RPMI media and infected with adenoviruses expressing either the PDX-1 or the MafA protein (from 0 to 5 × 109 pfu/well) for 2 h. As a control, another set of cells was infected with the adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). The wells were washed with RPMI media followed by a 24-h culture period in media containing either 0.8 or 11.1 mm glucose. Insulin content and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion were measured in static incubations as described previously (13Zhang H.-J. Walseth T.F. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were obtained by harvesting cells as described above in lysis buffer containing 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture set II (Calbiochem). Protein lysates were separated on 10% polyacrylamide Ready gels (Bio-Rad) and immunoblotted as described above to determine respective protein overexpression. Electromobility Shift Assay and Northern Blot Analysis—Late passage HIT-T15 cells were subcultured for 72 h in 100-mm culture plates, 4.5 × 106 cells/plate. The cells were washed with RPMI media and infected with GFP, PDX-1, MafA, or a combination of PDX-1 and MafA adenoviruses (3 × 1010 pfu/plate) for 2 h. The wells were washed with RPMI media followed by a 24-h culture period. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. Electromobility shift assay was performed according to the method described by Olson et al. (6Olson L.K. Redmon J.B. Towle H.C. Robertson R.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blot analysis as described above. The membrane was prehybridized for 1 h followed by a 16-h hybridization at 42 °C with 32P-labeled Syrian hamster preproinsulin cDNA (15Bell G.I. Sanchez-Pescador R. Diabetes. 1984; 33: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and human β-actin cDNA (16Gunning P. Ponte P. Okayama H. Engel J. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Two high stringency washes were performed at 50 °C for 30 min. Detection of protein binding and mRNA levels was performed using the Cyclone storage phosphor system (Packard), and densitometry was performed using the OptiQuant image analysis software (Packard). Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance where appropriate with significance set at p < 0.05. Western and Northern Analyses for MafA—MafA protein levels were measured in nuclear extracts from HIT-T15 cells (Fig. 1) using early passage (p71–75; lane 1) and late passage (p123–128; lane 2) cells chronically cultured in glucotoxic conditions (RPMI media containing 11.1 mm glucose). Late passage cells contained 3 ± 1% MafA protein of that found in early passage cells (p < 0.0001). MafA mRNA levels were not different between early and late passage cells (55.3 ± 4.0 versus 52.5 ± 3.3 density light units (DLU), MafA/18 S, respectively; Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained using a mouse MafA cDNA +1to +360 probe (data not shown).Fig. 2MafA mRNA levels are normal in glucotoxic HIT-T15 cells. Northern blot analysis for MafA mRNA in early passage cells (lanes 1–3) and late passage cells (lanes 4–6) was performed. The 18 S band is shown as a control for equal loading among the lanes. Results are also presented as mean ± S.E.; data are averaged from densitometry of 3 blots (in DLU).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mechanism of Post-translational Regulation of MafA—To examine post-translational mechanisms of MafA degradation, early passage cells were cultured with or without lactacystin, an irreversible proteasome inhibitor under 0.8 and 11.1 mm glucose conditions. The accumulation of MafA protein was augmented by the addition of the proteasome inhibitor in cells cultured both in 0.8 mm glucose (3147.3 ± 380.3 versus 4812 ± 617.2 DLU; no lactacystin versus lactacystin; p < 0.03, n = 4) and in 11.1 mm glucose (4468.3 ± 659.7 versus 6712.8 ± 1281.4 DLU; p < 0.04, n = 4; Fig. 3A), suggesting that degradation occurs via the proteasome pathway. Immunoprecipitation of these cellular lysates with MafA antibody, followed by immunoblot analysis with antiubiquitin, indicated that MafA is ubiquitinated (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, PDX-1 was also brought down with the MafA immunoprecipitation assay, indicating that a physical interaction exists between PDX-1 and MafA. Furthermore, PDX-1 protein is also ubiquitinated (data not shown). Preventive Effect of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) on the Loss of MafA Protein and MafA Binding to the Insulin Promoter in Cells Chronically Cultured in 11.1 mm Glucose—Chronic culturing of HIT-T15 cells with NAC starting at passage 70 prevented the loss of MafA protein in nuclear extracts of late passage cells (0.687 ± 0.20 DLU in 5 mm NAC-treated versus 0.189 ± 0.10 DLU in untreated cells, p < 0.02, n = 4–5; Fig. 4). The level of MafA protein in the 5 mm NAC-treated late passage cells did not differ significantly from the early passage cells. Although treatment with 5 mm NAC was necessary to have a significant effect on protein levels, a concentration of 0.5 mm NAC was sufficient to significantly improve the amount of protein binding to the C1 element of the insulin promoter (0.90 ± 0.12 versus 0.64 ± 0.05 DLU in the untreated late passage cells, p < 0.05, n = 4–6; Fig. 5). Higher concentrations of NAC (1 and 5 mm) further augmented the amount of MafA binding (1.28 ± 0.04 and 1.16 ± 0.1 DLU, respectively, p < 0.0005 versus untreated).Fig. 5NAC prevents the loss of MafA protein binding to the insulin promoter in late passage HIT-T15 cells chronically cultured in 11.1 mm glucose.

Insulin promoter activity was determined by measuring luciferase activity in HIT-T15 cells. In agreement with our previous data (8Harmon J.S. Tanaka Y. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), late passage cells grown in 11.1 mm glucose had diminished promoter activity as compared with early passage cells. This decrease could be partially restored with PDX-1 (no PDX-1 = 34% of early passage; PDX-1 = 78% of early passage; Fig. 7A). Transfection with MafA cDNA also partially restored the level of promoter activity in glucotoxic cells (no MafA = 34% of early passage; MafA = 70% of early passage; Fig. 7B). Co-transfection with both MafA and PDX-1 cDNAs completely restored insulin promoter activity to the levels observed in early passage cells (Fig. 7C).Fig. 7MafA and PDX-1 co-transfection completely restores insulin promoter activity. Insulin promoter activity was measured by firefly luciferase activity corrected for transfection efficiency with pRL-CMV measured by Renilla luciferase activity in early passage (p71–75) and late passage (p123–128) cells chronically cultured in 11.1 mm glucose. A, transfection with CMV4 control (0 ng) or PDX-1 cDNA (12.5 or 25 ng); B, transfection with CMV4 control (0 ng) or MafA cDNA (12.5 or 25 ng); and panel C, transfection with CMV4 control (0 ng) or both MafA and PDX-1 cDNAs (12.5 or 25 ng of each) (n = 7–10, *, p < 0.05 late versus early).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Adenoviral Overexpression of PDX-1 and MafA—Western blot analysis indicated that the levels of PDX-1 and MafA proteins in late passage cells increased following infection with their respective adenoviruses with the greatest level of expression at 24 h (Fig. 8A). Infection with the control GFP adenovirus did not affect the levels of PDX-1 or Maf A proteins as compared with uninfected cells (data not shown). The overexpressed proteins were functional as determined by their ability to bind to their respective sites on the insulin promoter (Fig. 8B). Twenty-four hours after infection, the PDX-1 adenovirus increased protein binding to the A3 site of the insulin promoter 4.3 ± 0.3-fold over the GFP-infected late passage cells (n = 3, p < 0.001). Infection with the MafA adenovirus increased protein binding to the C1 site of the insulin promoter 7.7 ± 0.8-fold over the GFP-infected cells (n = 3, p < 0.0001). Infection with the GFP control adenovirus had no effect on endogenous PDX-1 or MafA protein binding to their respective insulin promoter elements as compared with uninfected cells (data not shown). Insulin mRNA levels were measured by Northern blot analysis 24 h after adenoviral infection (Fig. 9). Infection of early passage cells with MafA and PDX-1 adenoviruses had no effect on insulin mRNA (A). Late passage cells had significantly lower mRNA levels as compared with early passage cells (Fig. 9, B versus A, lane 1; 0.435 ± 0.05 DLU versus 4.98 ± 0.44, respectively, p < 0.001). Infection of late passage cells (Fig. 9, B and C) with the PDX-1 adenovirus increased insulin mRNA as compared with GFP-infected cells (174.2 ± 11.6 versus 120.6 ± 8.2 DLU, respectively, p < 0.009, n = 5). MafA plus PDX-1 overexpression further increased the level of insulin message to 232.8 ± 16.7 DLU (p < 0.0001 as compared with GFP infection, n = 5). MafA overexpression alone increased the level of insulin mRNA but not to a statistically significant level (152.7 ± 7.9 DLU, p < 0.09, n = 5). Cells overexpressing PDX-1 and MafA plus PDX-1 had glucose-dependent increases in insulin mRNA and content. Cells infected with PDX-1 had insulin mRNA levels of 0.275 ± 0.010 and 0.301 ± 0.013 DLU (p < 0.05, n = 4) when cultured in the presence of 0.8 and 11.1 mm glucose, respectively. Cells infected with MafA plus PDX-1 had insulin mRNA levels of 0.323 ± 0.028 and 0.386 ± 0.023 DLU (p < 0.02, n = 4) when cultured in the presence of 0.8 and 11.1 mm glucose. The glucose-dependent increase in insulin mRNA caused by overexpression with MafA did not reach significance 0.262 ± 0.011 and 0.300 ± 0.044 DLU (p < 0.12, n = 4). Insulin content was also significantly increased in cells overexpressing PDX-1 and MafA plus PDX-1 (1172.25 ± 8.95 and 970.33 ± 104.33 microunits/ml respectively, as compared with 451.67 ± 76.12 microunits/ml in GFP-infected cells; p < 0.01–0.001; all n = 3). MafA overexpression also resulted in an increase in insulin content (635.67 ± 36.25 microunits/ml), although not significantly (p < 0.09). Static incubations of infected cells in 0.1 versus 0.8 mm glucose demonstrated increases of insulin secretion with the higher glucose concentration (data not shown), but the magnitudes of the increments were not different among the four infection conditions. The recent identification of RIPE-3b1 as MafA (10Olbrot M. Rud J. Moss L.G. Sharma A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6737-6742Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 11Kataoka K.

Jarrett H.W. Friedman D. Means A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6049-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) enabled us to perform the studies described in this report. We show that, as with PDX-1, MafA protein is virtually absent in glucotoxic HIT-T15 cells. However, in contrast to the decrease in the level of PDX-1 mRNA, MafA mRNA levels remain normal in glucotoxic cells, suggesting post-translational modification of the protein. In the current study, we show that MafA protein is ubiquitinated and that blocking the proteasomal pathway with lactacystin leads to an accumulation of MafA. The antioxidant, NAC, which prevents disappearance of PDX-1 in glucotoxic states (17Robertson R.P. Harmon J. Tran P.O. Tanaka Y. Takahashi H. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), also prevented loss of MafA protein and its binding to the insulin promoter in these cells. Furthermore, transient transfection with either transcription factor improved defective insulin promoter activity, and transfection with both fully restored this activity. Combined adenoviral overexpression of PDX-1 and MafA partially restored endogenous insulin gene expression and insulin content in glucotoxic HIT-T15 cells. Maf proteins are a family of transcription factors that are key regulators in cellular differentiation. The oncoprotein v-Maf (musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma) was the first identified member of the Maf family (18Nishizawa M. Kataoka K. Goto N. Fujiwara K.T. Kawai S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7711-7715Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These transcription factors all contain a conserved basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain necessary for their dimerization and DNA binding properties. Three members are referred to as small Mafs: MafG, MafF, and MafK. The additional four large Maf members are c-Maf, MafB, neural retina leucine zipper, and MafA (L-Maf), which have a well conserved N-terminal transactivation domain. The MafA gene was originally isolated from avian neuroretina cells (19Benkhelifa S. Provot S. Lecoq O. Pouponnot C. Calothy G. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.-P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and recently identified in pancreatic islets (10Olbrot M. Rud J. Moss L.G. Sharma A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6737-6742Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 11Kataoka K. Han S.-I. Shioda S. Hirai M. Nishizawa M. Handa H. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Within the islet, MafA is localized to the beta cell, whereas expression of MafB (12Matsuoka T.-A. Zhao L. Artner I. Jarrett H.W. Friedman D. Means A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6049-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and c-Maf (21Kataoka K. Shioda S. Ando K. Sakagami K. Handa H. Yasuda K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) is limited to the alpha cell. Furthermore, MafA has been found to be required for the formation and development of mature islet beta cells (20Matsuoka T.-A. Artner I. Henderson E. Means A. Sander M. Stein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2930-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Regulation of the insulin gene by MafA (11Kataoka K. Han S.-I. Shioda S. Hirai M. Nishizawa M. Handa H. J. Biol.

Commun. 2003; 312: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) occurs via binding to the RIPE-3b1/C1 element of the insulin promoter, which is similar to the binding sequence referred to as Maf-recognition element(MARE). Loss of this essential activator of insulin gene transcription greatly compromises insulin gene expression. We have proposed that chronic oxidative stress is an important mechanism for glucose toxicity (17Robertson R.P. Harmon J. Tran P.O. Tanaka Y. Takahashi H. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Treatment of Zucker diabetic fatty rats (5Tanaka Y. Gleason C.E. Tran P.O.T. Harmon J.S. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10857-10862Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and db/db mice (4Kaneto H. Kajimoto Y. Miyagawa J.-I. Matsuoka T.-a. Fujitani Y. Umayahara Y. Hanafusa T. Matsuzawa Y. Yamasaki Y. Hori M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2398-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) with NAC protected against the progression of type 2 diabetes. Performance of molecular studies designed to examine mechanisms of glucose toxicity is not possible with isolated islets because they do not withstand chronic cultures over many months. Therefore, we have used HIT-T15 cells cultured under high glucose concentrations for periods up to 1 year. In all respects, this beta cell line reproduces the losses in PDX-1, MafA, insulin mRNA, insulin content, and glucose-induced insulin secretion that have been found in animal models. For example, NAC prevented the loss of insulin message and promoter activity and significantly improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in late passage HIT-T15 cells chronically cultured with media containing 11.1 mm glucose (5Tanaka Y. Gleason C.E. Tran P.O.T. Harmon J.S. Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10857-10862Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Loss of PDX-1 protein and decreased binding to the insulin promoter could be prevented by culturing cells with NAC (17Robertson R.P. Harmon J. Tran P.O. Tanaka Y. Takahashi H. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that NAC also has beneficial effects on MafA by preserving protein expression and binding to the insulin promoter. This finding is consistent with the observation that MafA binding to the human insulin promoter can be abolished with oxidizing agents (23Read M.L. Masson M.R. Docherty K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and further supports the role of oxidative stress as a mechanism for glucose toxicity. Complete recovery of insulin promoter activity with the combined transient overexpression of PDX-1 and MafA supports our hypothesis that both factors were required for normal activity. However, the incomplete recovery of endogenous insulin message in the adenoviral infection studies suggests that a greater duration of exposure to overexpressed proteins may be needed for full restoration of insulin mRNA and/or that other factors involved in insulin transcription may also be diminished in glucotoxic cells. Prior to recognizing the RIPE-3b1 activator as MafA, cooperativity between proteins binding to the RIPE3a and RIPE3b elements had been observed (24Hwung Y.-P. Gu Y.-Z. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Shieh S.-Y. Tsai M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16708-16714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homo- and heterodimers formed between Mafs and other basic leucine zipper factors (for a review, see Ref. 26Blank V. Andrews N.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) can lead to positive or negative transcriptional regulation depending on the combination. The small Maf proteins, as homo- or heterodimers, can bind to Maf-recognition elements and act as transcriptional repressors (27Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Since oxidative stress has been shown to induce the levels of MafG (28Crawford D.R. Leahy K.P. Wang Y. Schools G.P. Kochheiser J.C. Davies K.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), it is possible that these small Mafs may also have an effect on insulin gene regulation. Alternatively, proteins interfering with positive regulators may facilitate the down-regulation of the insulin gene (29Melloul D. Marshak S. Cerasi E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 309-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Beta cells exposed to high glucose levels have increased gene expression of Id-1 and Id-3 (30Wice B.M. Bernal-Mizrachi E. Permutt M.A. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and up-regulated CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein/β levels (31Seufert J. Weir G.C. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2528-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), all of which can negatively affect insulin gene expression (31Seufert J. Weir G.C. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2528-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Cordle S.R. Henderson E. Masuoka H. Weil P.A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1734-1738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibition is likely due to their interference with E47 homodimer or heterodimer formation (29Melloul D. Marshak S. Cerasi E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 309-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the recent identification of RIPE-3b1 as MafA has allowed us to now demonstrate that protein levels of this insulin gene transcription factor are virtually absent in glucotoxic beta cells. In contrast to the transcription defect leading to PDX-1 protein loss, this work indicates that the defect leading to MafA protein loss is post-translational. MafA is ubiquitinated, and blocking the proteasomal pathway with lactacystin resulted in an increase in MafA protein levels. Combined transient transfection of PDX-1 and MafA completely normalizes insulin promoter activity, and combined adenoviral overexpression of PDX-1 and MafA increases endogenous insulin gene expression in glucotoxic HIT-T15 cells. That NAC prevents the loss of both MafA and PDX-1 proteins and their binding to the insulin promoter in glucotoxic HIT-T15 cells supports our hypothesis that chronic oxidative stress is a central mechanism for glucotoxicity and beta cell dysfunction.

https://openalex.org/W2090880001,"Proline metabolism has been studied in procyclic form Trypanosoma brucei. These parasites consume six times more proline from the medium when glucose is in limiting supply than when this carbohydrate is present as an abundant energy source. The sensitivity of procyclic T. brucei to oligomycin increases by three orders of magnitude when the parasites are obliged to catabolize proline in medium depleted in glucose. This indicates that oxidative phosphorylation is far more important to energy metabolism in this latter case than when glucose is available and the energy needs of the parasite can be fulfilled by substrate level phosphorylation alone. A gene encoding proline dehydrogenase, the first enzyme of the proline catabolic pathway, was cloned. RNA interference studies revealed the loss of this activity to be conditionally lethal. Proline dehydrogenase defective parasites grew as wild-type when glucose was available, but, unlike wild-type cells, they failed to proliferate using proline. In parasites grown in the presence of glucose, proline dehydrogenase activity was markedly lower than when glucose was absent from the medium. Proline uptake too was shown to be diminished when glucose was abundant in the growth medium. Wild-type cells were sensitive to 2-deoxy-d-glucose if grown using proline as the principal carbon source, but not in glucose-rich medium, indicating that this non-catabolizable glucose analogue might also stimulate repression of proline utilization. These results indicate that the ability of trypanosomes to use proline as an energy source can be regulated depending upon the availability of glucose.

African trypanosomes of the brucei subgroup are responsible for a number of important diseases in man and animals (1Barrett M.P. Burchmore R.J. Stich A. Lazzari J.O. Frasch A.C. Cazzulo J.J. Krishna S. Lancet. 2003; 362: 1469-1480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The metabolism of these organisms has been the subject of considerable interest. Bloodstream form trypanosomes are entirely dependent upon glycolytic substrate level phosphorylation for the generation of energy (2Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 3Michels P.A. Hannaert V. Bringaud F. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 482-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The first seven steps of the glycolytic pathway are localized to an unusual organelle, the glycosome (4Opperdoes F.R. Borst P. Spits H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 76: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A glycerol 3-phosphate:dihydroxyacetone-phosphate shuttle operates between the glycosome and the mitochondrion where a plant like ubiquinone-linked alternative oxidase acts to transfer electrons to oxygen (5Tielens A.G.M. Van Hellemond J.J. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This shuttle is critical in maintaining the NAD+/NADH balance within the glycosome. No net ATP synthesis occurs in the glycosome but ATP is produced cytosolically by the pyruvate kinase reaction (6Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar). Pyruvate is excreted from these cells with no further metabolism and a mere two moles of ATP are synthesized per mole of glucose used. Bloodstream form trypanosomes can sustain this profligate metabolism as they are exposed to a steady supply of high glucose in mammalian blood. They cannot, however, use non-carbohydrate substrates for the generation of energy. Glucose metabolism is thus perceived as an excellent target for therapeutic intervention in bloodstream form trypanosomes (7Verlinde C.L. Hannaert V. Blonski C. Willson M. Perie J.J.

It appears that the Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream energy metabolism is very simple and contrasts with the more elaborate version present in all the other trypanosomatids analyzed so far, including the insect stages of T. brucei (3Michels P.A.

Kinetoplastid Biol. Dis. 2003; 2: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The life cycle of brucei group trypanosomes is complex. Multiple distinct stages exist in the tsetse fly vector that carries the parasite between mammalian hosts (9Vickerman K. Br. Med. Bull. 1985; 41: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The metabolism of the parasites, as they proliferate in the midgut of their tsetse fly vector, is markedly different from that used by the bloodstream form. In the tsetse midgut, glucose is scarce but may become transiently abundant following insect blood meals. Proline is a key energy source within the tsetse fly (10Balogun R.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 1974; 49: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 11Bursell E. Billing K.J. Hargrove J.W. McCabe C.T. Slack E. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1973; 67: 296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and it has been speculated that this is a main energy source for the procyclic form trypanosomes too (12Ford W.C. Bowman I.B. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1973; 67: 257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 13Evans D.A. Brown R.C. J.

However, procyclics make efficient use of glucose, which is the preferred carbon source in the glucose-rich medium commonly used to grow these parasites (15Cross G.A. Klein R.A. Linstead D.J. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Brun R. Schonenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). Until recently, it was widely accepted that procyclic trypanosomes produce ATP primarily by the mitochondrial F0/F1-ATP synthase (oxidative phosphorylation) exploiting the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane generated by the respiratory chain (5Tielens A.G.M. Van Hellemond J.J. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, the respiratory chain was considered to be fed chiefly by NADH produced by the tricarboxylic acid cycle (6Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar). However, recent publications questioned these conclusions and a new model has been proposed (17Besteiro S. Barrett M.P. Rivière L. Bringaud F. Trends Parasitol. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A functional Krebs cycle is not essential for energy metabolism and aconitase-defective cells thrive using glucose as an energy source (18Van Weelden S.W. Fast B. Vogt A. Van Der Meer P. Saas J. Van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12854-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, blocking the mitochondrial F0/F1-ATP synthase has little impact on growth and does not affect ATP production in glucose-rich medium (19Coustou V. Besteiro S. Biran M. Diolez P. Bouchaud V. Voisin P. Michels P.A. Canioni P. Baltz T. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49625-49635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), while substrate level phosphorylation does appear to be essential to growth (19Coustou V. Besteiro S. Biran M. Diolez P. Bouchaud V. Voisin P. Michels P.A. Canioni P. Baltz T. Bringaud F. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32849-32854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Essential sites of ATP production by substrate level phosphorylation include the cytosol (phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase) and the mitochondrion (succinyl-CoA synthetase). Interestingly, the succinyl-CoA synthetase, shown to be essential to procyclic trypanosomes, catalyzes the last step of both glucose and proline degradation to produce the excreted end products acetate and succinate, respectively (Fig. 1) (18Van Weelden S.W. Fast B. Vogt A. Van Der Meer P. Saas J. Van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12854-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To date, no in vitro studies using cells grown in glucose-depleted medium, conditions to mimic the midgut environment of tsetse flies between blood meals, appear to have been conducted. We therefore set out to investigate the ability of procyclic trypanosomes to catabolize proline and to determine whether the availability of glucose influences this. To address this question, we adapted two T. brucei procyclic strains (EATRO1125 and 427) to glucose-depleted medium and studied their carbon source comsumption and sensitivity to oligomycin (the most specific inihibitor of the F0/F1-ATP synthase). In addition, we have generated and analyzed a mutant cell line inhibited for the second step of the proline metabolism (proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) 1The abbreviations used are: PRODH, proline dehydrogenase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; FCS, fetal calf serum; INT, iodonitrophenyl tetrazolium; DCPIP, dichlorophenolindophenol; RNAi, RNA interference.). This analysis shows that glucose exerts a negative control on proline metabolism by down-regulating PRODH and affecting proline uptake (Fig. 1). Trypanosomes and Cell Culture—T. brucei strain 427 and EATRO1125 procyclic forms were cultivated at 25 °C in SDM79 medium (16Brun R. Schonenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar) or a glucose-depleted medium derived from SDM79, called SDM80 (1 mm NaH2PO4, 116 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 26.2 mm NaHCO3, 30.7 mm Hepes, 23.9 mm MOPS, 4 mm pyruvate, 1% (v/v) vitamin mix 100× (Invitrogen, catalog number 010144), 5.2 mm proline (or no proline), 5.9 mm threonine, 1.1 mm l-arginine, 0.58 mm l-methionine, 0.68 mm l-phenylalanine, 0.75 mm l-tyrosine, 0.1 mm l-cystine, 0.2 mm l-histidine, 0.4 mm l-isoleucine, 0.76 mm l-leucine, 0.4 mm l-lysine, 0.05 mm l-tryptophan, 0.4 mm l-valine, 2.25 mm l-alanine, 0.1 mm l-asparagine, 0.1 mm l-aspartic acid, 0.09 mm l-glutamic acid, 0.49 mm l-serine, 0.1 mm glycine, 1.28 mm taurine, 0.46 mm glutamine, 0.2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm hypoxanthine, 0.017 mm thymidine, 0.1 mm kanamycin, 0.008 mm hemin). Fetal calf serum (FCS) dialyzed by ultrafiltration against 0.15 m NaCl (molecular mass cutoff: 10,000 Da) and heat inactivated (Sigma: catalog number F0392, glucose concentration: 1 mm) was added to 9% (v/v) and heat-inactivated FCS (glucose concentration: 5 mm) to 1% (v/v). The glucose concentration in the SDM80 medium is 0.15 mm as compared with 6 mm in the SDM79 medium. The T. brucei cell line 29-13 (derived from strain 427) used in RNA interference experiments was grown in SDM79 medium containing 15 μg·ml-1 G418 and 25 μg·ml-1 hygromycin B. Determination of Metabolite Consumption and Excretion—To determine the concentration of metabolites consumed or excreted by the EATRO1125 procyclic trypanosomes, cells (inoculated at 106 cells·ml-1) were grown in SDM80 medium (with 1.6 mm l-glutamine and 8 mm l-threonine) either containing or lacking 10 mm d-glucose, until stationary phase was reached. Aliquots of the growth medium were collected twice a day for analysis. The quantity of d-glucose present in the medium was determined using the “glucose trinder kit” (Sigma). Pyruvate concentration was determined enzymatically as described previously (22Czok R. Lamprecht W. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3. Verlag Chemie/Academic Press, New York1974: 1585-1589Google Scholar). The concentration of each of the 20 amino acids present in the medium was determined by chromatography on an automatic amino acid analyzer coupled to a computing integrator (Beckman), after deproteinization of the samples by perchloric acid treatment. Additionally, a colorimetric assay (23Bates L.S. Waldren R.P. Teare I.D. Plant Soil. 1973; 39: 205-207Crossref Scopus (13286) Google Scholar) was used to determine the proline concentration. Determination of Oligomycin Sensitivity—The EATRO1125 and 427 procyclic cells (2 × 106 cells·ml-1) were incubated in SDM80 either containing or lacking 6 mm glucose, in the presence of decreasing quantities of oligomycin (from 50 μg·ml-1 to 0.01 ng·ml-1). The assay was performed in 96-well microtitre plates with 100 μl of cell suspension per well, and the cell viability was determined optically. The oligomycin concentration required to kill all of the cells (lethal dose 100: LD100) was determined 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after drug addition. Cloning of the Proline Dehydrogenase Gene and DNA/RNA Analysis—T. brucei genomic DNA was made using a mini-prep method (24Medina-Acosta E. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Total RNA was produced using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen), and Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) was used for all PCR reactions using a GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For reverse transcriptase PCR experiments, the enzyme SUPERScript II, RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was used. The 5′ end of the proline dehydrogenase gene was obtained using a specific internal primer (RTTb1 5′-ACATGCCTGTCACCTTAACAGC) and spliced leader primers (SL1 5′-TAACGCTATATAAGTATCAGTTTC and SL2 5′-AGTATCAGTTTCTGTACTTTATTG). Southern and Northern blotting (using 5 μg of DNA or 4 μg of RNA per lane, respectively) were as described (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.37-16.68Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled probes were made using the Prime It® II kit (Stratagene). Vector NTI (v 6.0) was used to analyze DNA and protein sequences (searching for open reading frames and restriction sites and construction of cloning and expression plasmids). SignalP (26Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. von Heijne G. Brunak S. Proteins. 1996; 24: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), Predotar (Institut National de Recherche Agronomique), and TargetP (27Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar), MitoProt (28Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar), and Tmpred (29Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar) were used to search for secretory, mitochondrial, or other targeting signals and transmembrane domains, respectively. Production of Anti-PRODH Antibodies and Protein Analysis—Recombinant PRODH lacking the N-terminal 72 amino acids that included the mitochondrial targeting sequence and a putative transmembrane domain (preliminary experiments showed that the presence of these domains precluded soluble expression) was created after amplification using primers TbPRODH72 (5′-AAACATATGAAGCGTGCTGAGGCAATTTTT) and Tbrev (5′-CCCAAGCTTCATCCAAAAGACGCG). The product was ultimately cloned into pET21a+ and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Protein was produced in soluble form after expression at 16 °C in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The purification was performed on the Biocad 700E work station using Ni2+ chelate chromatography (Novagen) with the elution buffer recommended by the manufacturer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole). Antiserum was raised in rabbits (Diagnostics Scotland), with an initial injection of 0.4 ml of protein solution at 1 mg·ml-1 followed by three more 0.2-ml injections at 1-month intervals. Antibodies were purified using an AminoLink® (Pierce) kit carrying immobilized purified PRODH on a solid support. Purified antibodies were aliquoted and stored at -20 °C until use. Western blotting of SDS-PAGE separated proteins on nitrocellulose membranes involved blocking for 3 h at room temperature with 1× TBS (0.02 m Tris-HCl, 13.7 mm NaCl) containing 5% (w/v) powdered milk and 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20. The primary antibody, antihistidine tag (diluted 1:2000) or specific PRODH antibody (diluted 1:500 to 1:5000), was made up in 1× TBS, 1% (w/v) powdered milk, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, before being added to the membrane and shaken overnight at 4 °C. The SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) protocol with 1:2000 diluted anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase or with 1:500 to 1:5000 anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled IgG (Sigma) allowed the detection of the proteins according to manufacturer's specifications. Proline Dehydrogenase Assay—PRODH activity was measured following the reduction of the electron-accepting dye iodonitrophenyl tetrazolium (INT), at 520 nm (30Menzel R. Roth J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 21-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), or dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) (31Johnson A.B. Strecter H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1876-1882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at 600 nm (32Brown E.D. Wood J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8972-8979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Log phase procyclic cells were harvested and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.9, before being resuspended in 500 μl of TSE buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose) and lysed by sonication before testing for PRODH activity (33Obungu V.H. Kiaira J.K. Njogu R.M. Olembo N.K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1999; 123: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 34Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The INT reaction mixture contained variable proline concentrations, 16% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 0.4% (v/v) Tween 20; 0.16 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.04 mg of gelatin, and 0.5 mm INT. The DCPIP reaction mixture contained 11 mm MOPS, 11 mm MgCl2, 11% (v/v) glycerol, 0.28 mm phenazine methosulfate, and 56 μm of DCPIP, pH 7.5. Variable proline concentrations were added to 900-950 μl of the stock assay mix, and the reaction was started by adding the enzyme (1-50 μl). Activity was monitored spectrophotometrically in cuvettes with a 1-cm light path at 600 nm. RNA Interference (RNAi)—A 606-bp, XbaI-flanked, fragment of the PRODH gene was amplified by PCR from T. brucei gDNA using specific primers each containing an XbaI restriction site (5′-ATTTTCTAGACTCGGACCCATCCATATTTCG and 5′-CCCTCTAGAATCACAACATTACACTCCTCC). This PCR product was cloned into the plasmid p2T7 (35LaCount D.J. Bruse S. Hill K.L. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) yielding the plasmid p2T7PRODH. 8 μg of NotI-linearized p2T7PRODH was transfected into the T. brucei cell line 29-13 (strain 427), washed, and resuspended in Zimmerman's post-fusion medium by electroporation in a 0.4-cm cuvette, using a single pulse at a voltage of 1.5 kV and 25-microfarad capacitance with an infinite resistance using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. Transfected parasites were transferred into prewarmed SDM79 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FCS, 15 μg·ml-1 G418, and 25 μg·ml-1 hygromycin B at 25 °C. 24 h later 10 μg·ml-1 phleomycin was added to the medium to select stably expressing cell lines. Clones were selected by limiting dilution in SDM79 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and 25% (v/v) conditioned medium collected and filtered after cultivation of wild-type parasites. Cultures of one clone (Δprodh, clone F2) were initiated using 5 × 105 parasites·ml-1 in the absence or the presence of 1 μg·ml-1 tetracycline (tetracycline induces the expression of dsRNA). 10 ml of complete SDM79 medium was used or 10 ml of SDM80 medium supplemented with proline and/or glucose at different concentrations as stated in the text. Parasite density was measured every 24 h with an improved Neubauer hematocytometer (Weber Scientific). Growth was also analyzed using the Alamar® blue assay (36Raz B. Iten M. Grether-Buhler Y. Kaminsky R. Brun R. Acta Trop. 1997; 68: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Proline Uptake Assay—T. brucei strain 427 grown in SDM80 medium, either containing or lacking 10 mm glucose, or Δprodh clone F2 grown in SDM79 were harvested during the mid-log phase of growth by centrifuging at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C before being washed twice in Carter's balanced saline solution (37Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in Carter's balanced saline solution at the density of 108 parasite·ml-1. Radiolabeled l-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline (112 Ci·mmol-1) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used in uptake assays. Uptake involved the oil stop transport assay as described (37Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 38Hasne M.P. Barrett M.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with 100 μl of the test solution cushioned above 90 μl of oil mixture (di-n-butylphthalate and mineral oil at a ratio of 7:1). 100 μl of cells (at 108 cells·ml-1) were added to each tube and incubated for times ranging between 3 s and 3 h depending on the experiment. The transport assays were terminated by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 1 min at room temperature). Samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen before removing the pellets using a tube cutter and transferring them to scintillation vials containing 200 μl of 2% (w/v) SDS. 3 ml of scintillation fluid (Ecoscint A, National Diagnostics) was added and tubes left overnight. Radioactivity levels were determined by using an LKB Wallac 1219 Rackbeta liquid scintillation counter. Background levels, which correspond to the non-transported radiolabeled compounds associated with the cells (in the interstitial space), were measured by performing uptake assays on ice for <3 s. Data were analyzed using the PRISM and Grafit 4.0 software (Erithacus). Kinetic constants were determined by non-linear regression analysis using the Michaelis-Menten equation. Increase of Proline Consumption in T. brucei Cultivated in Glucose-depleted Medium—The SDM79 semidefined medium has become the growth medium of choice for procyclic form T. brucei (16Brun R. Schonenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). This insect stage parasite, grown in SDM79 or equivalent media, primarily consumes glucose as a carbon source and also depletes medium of threonine and to a lesser extent proline, glutamine, and pyruvate (15Cross G.A. Klein R.A. Linstead D.J. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Coustou V. Besteiro S. Biran M. Diolez P. Bouchaud V. Voisin P. Michels P.A. Canioni P. Baltz T. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49625-49635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) at significant rates. We previously estimated that the rate of glucose consumption of the EATRO1125 strain grown in the SDM79 medium is about 3-fold higher than the rate of proline consumption, during mid-log phase growth (19Coustou V. Besteiro S. Biran M. Diolez P. Bouchaud V. Voisin P. Michels P.A. Canioni P. Baltz T. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49625-49635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine whether the rate of consumption of other potential carbon sources is influenced by the absence of glucose, the EATRO1125 strain was adapted to the glucose-depleted medium SDM80 (0.15 mm glucose), a derivative of SDM79 (6 mm glucose). The 40-fold reduction in glucose concentration does not affect the growth rate of this procyclic cell line nor that of the T. brucei 427 strain (with doubling time being the same in SDM80, SDM80 containing 6 mm glucose, and SDM79 media (Fig. 2, top panels)). For the EATRO1125 line, the quantity of each of the 20 amino acids, and pyruvate, present in the growth medium, was determined for cells grown in the glucose-depleted (0.15 mm) and glucose-rich (6 mm) SDM80 media. For some amino acids, the rate of consumption (threonine, pyruvate, and glutamine) or production (glycine, alanine, and glutamate) was not different regardless of the medium used. The concentrations of other amino acids were not significantly altered in either medium. However, the rate of proline consumption increased severalfold in the glucose-depleted medium (Fig. 2). To quantify the relative proline consumption increase during the mid-log phase, both the EATRO1125 and 427 strains were incubated at a higher cell density (5 × 106), and the proline concentration in the growth medium was determined periodically over a period of 2 days (Fig. 3). The rate of proline consumption is ∼2-fold higher for the 427 cell line than for the EATRO1125 cell line in the presence (0.31 versus 0.15 μmol·h-1·mg protein-1) or the absence (1.8 versus 0.93 μmol·h-1·mg protein-1) of glucose. These differences may be related to the higher growth rate observed for the 427 strain (doubling time: 10.5 versus 13.8 h). However, the rate of proline consumption in the glucose-depleted medium is ∼6-fold increased in both EATRO1125 (6.3-fold) and 427 (5.7-fold) strains. We also attempted to grow the 427 cell line in medium lacking both glucose and proline but containing each of the other 19 commonly used l-amino acids at 10 mm. Proline, but no other amino acid, could support robust growth in glucose-depleted conditions (Fig. 4). This included l-glutamate, a direct product of the proline degradation pathway and glutamine, which is also converted into glutamate. Moreover, l-threonine could not support growth despite the fact that this amino acid is consumed in great quantities by procyclic T. brucei. In other experiments (not shown) proline was also included at low concentration (0.1 m) to ensure that non-energy requirements of this amino acid (e.g. protein biosynthesis) were provided. The presence of proline did not affect the outcome. Oxidative Phosphorylation Is Essential for Growth in Glucose-depleted Medium—We previously observed that in glucose-rich medium, pyruvate kinase, which produces ATP in the cytosol by substrate level phosphorylation, is essential for procyclic trypanosomes. In contrast, oligomycin (the most specific known inihibitor of the mitochondrial F0/F1-ATP synthase) does not affect the steady state amount of intracellular ATP and only moderately affects parasite growth (19Coustou V. Besteiro S. Biran M. Diolez P. Bouchaud V. Voisin P. Michels P.A. Canioni P. Baltz T. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49625-49635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We proposed that production of ATP by substrate level phosphorylation is essential, while ATP generation by the F0/F1-ATP synthase (oxidative phosphorylation) is available but not essential (19Coustou V. Besteiro S. Biran M. Diolez P. Bouchaud V. Voisin P. Michels P.A. Canioni P. Baltz T. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49625-49635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) for procyclic cells grown in glucose-rich medium. In the absence of glucose, the overall carbon source consumption decreases significantly, although the relative rate of proline consumption increases. We determined the oligomycin concentration required to kill all of the cells (LD100) grown in glucose-rich or glucose-depleted medium (Fig. 5). At day 3 of incubation with oligomycin, the EATRO1125 and 427 strains are 2000 and 5000 times more sensitive to the metabolic effector, respectively, when grown in glucose-depleted medium as compared with glucose-rich"

To investigate how these factors impart activation, their combined impact upon insulin enhancer-driven expression was first examined in non-β cell line transfection assays. Individual expression of PDX-1 and BETA2 led to little or no activation, whereas MafA alone did so modestly. MafA together with PDX-1 or BETA2 produced synergistic activation, with even higher insulin promoter activity found when all three proteins were present. Stimulation was attenuated upon compromising either MafA transactivation or DNA-binding activity. MafA interacted with endogenous PDX-1 and BETA2 in coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro GST pull-down assays, suggesting that regulation involved direct binding. Dominant-negative acting and small interfering RNAs of MafA also profoundly reduced insulin promoter activity in β cell lines. In addition, MafA was induced in parallel with insulin mRNA expression in glucose-stimulated rat islets. Insulin mRNA levels were also elevated in rat islets by adenoviral-mediated expression of MafA. Collectively, these results suggest that MafA plays a key role in coordinating and controlling the level of insulin gene expression in islet β cells.

Collectively, these results suggest that MafA plays a key role in coordinating and controlling the level of insulin gene expression in islet β cells. Insulin is selectively expressed in the pancreatic β cells of the islet of Langerhans. Restricted expression is due to a unique combination of factors that stimulate through conserved enhancer region sequences located approximately between nucleotides -340 and -90 relative to the transcription start site (1Karlsson O.

Detailed analysis has revealed that activation is primarily controlled by PAX6, PDX-1, MafA, and BETA2 binding to the C2 (-317 to -311 bp), A3 (-201 to -196 bp), C1 (-126 to -101 bp), and E1 (-100 to -91 bp) elements, respectively (5Ohneda K.

Gene ablation experiments performed in mice on pax6, pdx-1, and BETA2 have established a critical function for each in pancreatic development. Thus, PDX-1 is essential for the growth of the endocrine and exocrine compartments, with pancreatic development arresting at the early post-bud stage in homozygous pdx-1 mutant mice, resulting in pancreatic agenesis (18Jonsson J.

In contrast, the loss of PAX6 and BETA2 affects only islet cell development, with the number of α cells dramatically reduced in pax6 gene knock-out mice (9Sander M. Neubuser A. Kalamaras J. Ee H.C.

This process is mediated by interactions between activators themselves and by contact with the RNA polymerase II transcriptional apparatus, or indirectly through bridging coactivators. Thus, PDX-1 and BETA2 binding to the p300 coactivator or its paralogue p300/cAMP response element binding protein-binding protein (CBP) 1The abbreviations used are: CBP, p300/cAMP response element binding protein-binding protein; LUC, luciferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; aa, amino acid(s); GST, glutathione S-transferase; AdV, adenovirus; siRNA, small interference RNA; E, embryonic day.1The abbreviations used are: CBP, p300/cAMP response element binding protein-binding protein; LUC, luciferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; aa, amino acid(s); GST, glutathione S-transferase; AdV, adenovirus; siRNA, small interference RNA; E, embryonic day. provides a docking and recruitment interface with the general transcriptional machinery (27Chakrabarti S.K.

In this study, MafA was found to functionally interact with PDX-1 and BETA2 to promote synergistic activation of insulin enhancer-driven reporter activity in non-β cells. MafA was also shown to play a direct and principal role in insulin gene activation in β cell lines, although p300/CBP was not involved in this response. In addition, insulin mRNA levels were found to increase in conjunction with MafA in rat islets. Our results suggest that MafA-mediated signaling is important for high level expression of the insulin gene in β cells. DNA Constructs—The -238 insulin-firefly luciferase (LUC) expression plasmids contain wild-type rat insulin II gene sequences from bp -238 to +2 and PDX-1 (A3 and A1 (37Peshavaria M. Gamer L.

The construction of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer-driven MafA (13Matsuoka T.A. Zhao L. Artner I. Jarrett H.W. Friedman D. Means A. Stein R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2957-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) expression vectors was described previously. MafA135-359 was made by PCR from wild type mouse MafA and subcloned into the polylinker of the CMV-driven expression vector, pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen). The arginine to alanine mutant at amino acid 265 in MafA was constructed in the CMV:MafA 1-359 vector using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (top: 5′-CCGACTGAAACAGAAGGCGCGCACGCTCAAG-3′; the mutated nucleotides are underlined) (Stratagene). GST:MafA chimeras of full-length, amino acids (aa) 1-233, and aa 233-359 of mouse MafA were generated by in-frame fusion with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) coding sequences in the pGEM-KG bacterial expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The Gal4:MafA chimeras containing sequences from aa 1-359 (i.e. full-length) or aa 1-233 were constructed by subcloning PCR-amplified mouse MafA fragments into pSG424 (40Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) to create in-frame GAL4 DNA binding domain:MafA fusion proteins. The construction of the GAL4:BETA2 constructs containing the hamster full-length (1-355) or aa 156-355 of BETA2 were described previously (36Qiu Y. Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2957-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The CMV-driven wild type and p300 dl10 mutant (deletion of aa 1680-1811) have also been described (41Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. See R.H. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Shi Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The adenovirus type 5 E1A expression plasmid encodes for the wild type 243-aa protein. The adenovirus-5 expressing MafA under the control of the CMV enhancer/promoter (AdV-CMV) was generated using the mouse MafA cDNA as described previously (42Kelpe C.L. Moore P.C. Parazzoli S.D.

The correctness of each construct was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequence analysis. Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) of MafA were expressed from the RNA polymerase III H1 gene promoter in the pSUPER mammalian expression vector (43Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3963) Google Scholar). The targeted regions of murine MafA mRNA were selected using the online program available from Ambion Inc. (www.ambion.com/techlib/misc/siRNA_finder.html), and labeled relative to the nucleotides spanned from the ATG translation start codon. The following oligonucleotides were used for cloning into pSUPER (the MafA sequences are underlined): +64/+84 bp, 5′-GATCCCCAACGACTTCGACCTGATGAAGTTCAAGAGACTTCATCAGGTCGAAGTCGTTTTTTTGGAAA-3′; +82/+102, 5′-GATCCCCAAGTTCGAGGTGAAGAAGGAGTTCAAGAGACTCCTTCTTCACCTCGAACTTTTTTTGGAAA-3′; +955/+975, 5′-GATCCCCAAATACGAGAAGTTGGCGGGCTTCAAGAGAGCCCGCCAACTTCTCGTATTTTTTTTGGAAA-3′; +1054/+1074, 5′-GATCCCCAAAGGCGCACCCGACTTCTTTTTCAAGAGAAAAGAAGTCGGGTGCGCCTTTTTTTTGGAAA-3′. Cell Line Transfections and Rat Islet Isolation—The non-β (HeLa and HEK293) and β (βTC3 and MIN6) cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 25 mm glucose, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Insulin -238 LUC (0.25 μg) was transfected with MafA, PDX-1, and/or BETA2 expression vectors (0.25 μg/each) using the Lipofectamine procedure (Invitrogen). The CMV-driven Renilla luciferase expression plasmid phRL-TK (Promega) was used as a recovery marker (2 ng), with 1 μg of total DNA used for each point. The Dual Luciferase assay (Promega) was performed 40-48 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's directions. Each experiment was repeated at least four times using at least two different plasmid preparations. Rat islets were isolated by collagenase digestion from 6-week-old male Wistar rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IL) as described previously (44Briaud I. Harmon J.S. Kelpe C.L. Segu V.B. Poitout V. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). After an overnight culture in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 11 mm glucose, the islets were resuspended in fresh medium and incubated at 37 °C under the experimental conditions described in the figure legend. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—βTC3 cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 0.025% NaN3, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg of aprotinin per milliliter), whereas rat islets were sonicated in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mm activated sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Cellular debris was removed from the lysed islet samples by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). Extract protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with normal rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) or affinity-purified anti-MafA peptide antiserum (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, TX (13Matsuoka T.A. Zhao L. Artner I. Jarrett H.W. Friedman D. Means A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6049-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar)). The proteins were immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma), washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then electrotransferred onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blot was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in blocking buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk) and then at 4 °C overnight with either PDX-1, BETA2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), MafA (Bethyl Laboratories, TX), and TATA-binding protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) antiserum. The PDX-1 polyclonal antiserum was developed to N-terminal region (aa 1-75) epitopes (39Peshavaria M. Henderson E. Sharma A. Wright C.V. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3987-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the MafA siRNA experiment in 293 cells, lysates from CMV:MafA (100 ng)- and MafA siRNA-pSUPER (1 μg)-transfected cells were blotted and analyzed using anti-MafA antiserum. Antibody detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce Biotechnology) after incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. In Vitro Translation and GST Binding Assays—GST:MafA 1-359, GST:MafA 1-233, and GST:MafA 233-359 fusion proteins were prepared as specified by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Translation reactions were performed using the TnT in vitro translation kit (Promega, Madison, WI.) with CMV:PDX-1, CMV:BETA2, and l-[35S]methionine. Labeled proteins were incubated with GST:MafA coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h in binding buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ZnCl2). The beads were washed four times with binding buffer, and the bound protein complexes were eluted with 1× gel loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), resolved by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by fluorography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Batches of 350-500 islets each were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 400 μl of cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin), and allowed to swell on ice for 15 min before adding 25 μl of 10% (w/v) Nonidet P-40. After vortexing vigorously, the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 1 min, and 4 °C) and resuspended in 50 μl of high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) (17Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Gel shift binding reactions (20 μl) were conducted with 5-10 μg of nuclear extract protein and radiolabeled probe at room temperature for 30 min in the binding buffer (5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg/μl poly(dI-dC)). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the rat insulin II C1 (-126 TGGAAACTGCAGCTTCAGCCCCTCT -101) and E1 (-104 TCTGGCCATCTGCTGGATCCT -85) elements were annealed and labeled by end filling with the DNA Polymerase Large (Klenow) Fragment Kit (Promega) and [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The identities of the MafA- and BETA2-containing complexes were determined by wild type element competition as well as super-shift analyses with α-MafA antisera. The binding complexes were resolved by electrophoretic separation on a 4.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Measurement of Preproinsulin mRNA Levels—Duplicate batches of 100 islets each were infected overnight with 105 plaque-forming units per islet of the CMV-driven MafA (AdV-MafA) or the firefly luciferase (AdV-Luc (45Wicksteed B.

Islets were then transferred to fresh RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 16.7 mm glucose, and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with the MessageClean kit to remove DNA (Gene Hunter Corp., Nashville, TN). The ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) was carried out with a 360-bp sequence of the rat II preproinsulin gene and a conserved 245-bp sequence of the mouse β-actin gene using the Direct Protect Lysate RPA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) (42Kelpe C.L.

This analysis was conducted with several independently treated islet preparations. Statistical Analysis—The significance of the experimental findings was determined using analysis of variance with the least significance difference test (SAS9.1 statistical software, SAS Institute Inc, Carry, NC). A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. MafA Cooperates with PDX-1 and BETA2 to Induce Insulin-driven Transcription—Preventing PDX-1, BETA2, or MafA binding drastically reduces insulin enhancer-driven expression in β cells, suggesting that these factors act in a synergistic fashion to mediate transcription. Although the exact mechanisms involved in control are unclear, experiments performed in non-β cells imply that PDX-1 and BETA2 act together to cooperatively activate expression, a process augmented by the non-DNA binding p300 coactivator (27Chakrabarti S.K.

Interestingly, MafA was recently shown to be the only islet-enriched transcription factor that is first expressed in the insulin-producing progenitors that eventually populate the islet (29Matsuoka T.A. Artner I. Henderson E. Means A. Sander M. Stein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2930-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In contrast, PDX-1 and BETA2 are synthesized earlier and in a broader range of islet-hormone-producing cell types (8Naya F.J. Huang H.P. Qiu Y. Mutoh H. DeMayo F.J. Leiter A.B. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2323-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 10Guz Y. Montminy M.R. Stein R. Leonard J. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Teitelman G.

MafA is also capable of independently inducing endogenous insulin gene expression in an islet α cell line (αTC-6 (29Matsuoka T.A. Artner I. Henderson E. Means A. Sander M. Stein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2930-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar)). These data imply that MafA serves a unique role in mediating insulin gene expression. To test if MafA functionally interacts with other islet-enriched insulin activators, PDX-1 and BETA2 expression constructs were cotransfected with MafA and insulin enhancer/promoter-driven -238 LUC reporter constructs. These experiments were conducted in HeLa cells, a non-pancreatic cell line that does not produce insulin or islet-enriched transcription factors. As expected, wild type -238 LUC activity was not influenced by either PDX-1 or BETA2 alone (35Qiu Y. Guo M. Huang S. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), with MafA able to independently stimulate ∼20-fold (Fig. 1) (13Matsuoka T.A. Zhao L. Artner I. Jarrett H.W. Friedman D. Means A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6049-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Transactivation was stimulated in a synergistic manner when MafA was combined with either PDX-1 (Fig. 1B) or BETA2 (Fig. 1C). Additional enhancement of insulin-driven activity was also observed in the presence of all three factors (Fig. 1D). In general, PDX-1-, BETA2-, and MafA-mediated stimulation was dependent upon activator binding, because cooperativity with MafA was essentially lost in the PDX-1 (Fig. 1B, compare -238 WT responsiveness to the A3 and A1 mutants) and BETA2 (Fig. 1C) binding site mutants, whereas activation by MafA was greatly reduced in the C1 mutant (Fig. 1D). Cooperativity was also attenuated in MafA mutants deficient in activation (i.e. MafA 135-3"

In addition to insulin, increased glucose metabolism initiates an intracellular signaling pathway that transcriptionally regulates genes encoding lipogenic enzymes. A cis-acting sequence, the carbohydrate response element (ChoRE), has been found in the promoter region of several of these genes. ChREBP (carbohydrate response element-binding protein) was recently identified as a candidate transcription factor in the glucose-signaling pathway. We reported that ChREBP requires the heterodimeric partner Max-like factor X (Mlx) to bind to ChoRE sequences. In this study we provide further evidence to support a direct role of Mlx in glucose signaling in the liver. We constructed two different dominant negative forms of Mlx that could dimerize with ChREBP but block its binding to DNA. When introduced into hepatocytes, both dominant negative forms of Mlx inhibited the glucose response of a transfected ChoRE-containing promoter. The glucose response was rescued by adding exogenous wild type Mlx or ChREBP, but not MondoA, a paralog of ChREBP that can also form a heterodimer with Mlx. Furthermore, dominant negative Mlx blocked the induction of glucose-responsive genes from their natural chromosomal context under high glucose conditions. In contrast, genes induced by the insulin and thyroid hormone-signaling pathways were unaffected by dominant negative Mlx. Mlx was present in the glucose-responsive complex of liver nuclear extract from which ChREBP was purified. In conclusion, Mlx is an obligatory partner of ChREBP in regulating lipogenic enzyme genes in liver.

Excess dietary carbohydrate can be converted into triglycerides, the principal energy storage form, when food is plentiful. The synthesis of triglycerides from carbohydrate is termed de novo lipogenesis, and regulated lipogenesis occurs most abundantly in the liver in rodents. After a meal high in carbohydrates, many genes encoding enzymes involved in the lipogenic pathway are transcriptionally induced in liver, including L-type pyruvate kinase (PK), 1The abbreviations used are: PK, pyruvate kinase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; bHLH/LZ, basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper; SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c; ChoRE, carbohydrate response element; ChREBP, carbohydrate response element-binding protein; Mlx, Max-like protein X; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; T3, 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine. fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase α (ACC), and S14 (1Towle H.C.

Increased insulin secretion in response to elevated blood glucose levels activates the basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLH/LZ) transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) (4Brown M.S.

SREBP-1c binds to a regulatory sequence in the promoter region of most lipogenic enzyme genes to activate their transcription (7Magana M.M. Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

Overexpressing SREBP-1c in mice leads to an increased rate of lipogenesis and increased mRNA levels of lipogenic enzyme genes (9Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S.

However, both in vitro and in vivo data suggest that SREBP-1c alone is not sufficient to support the full induction of lipogenic enzyme genes in response to high carbohydrate diet (11Koo S.-H.

In addition to the insulin-signaling pathway, increased uptake and metabolism of glucose is now recognized as initiating a second signaling pathway responsible for controlling the synthesis of lipogenic enzymes. Increased glucose metabolism is postulated to generate a metabolite that activates the downstream signaling pathway. Both glucose 6-phosphate and xylulose 5-phosphate have been proposed as the critical metabolite in this pathway (2Girard J. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 325-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 13Doiron B. Cuif M.-H. Chen R. Kahn A. J. Biol.

A carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) that mediates the transcriptional response to glucose has been mapped within the promoter regions in several lipogenic enzyme genes (15Thompson K.S. Towle H.C.

The presence of E-box motifs in these response elements suggests that a bHLH protein family member recognizes the ChoRE and mediates the response to glucose. A candidate transcription factor was purified based on its ability to bind to the PK ChoRE (20Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). This factor, designated as carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), is a member of the bHLH/LZ family (21de Luis O. Valero M.C. Jurado L.A. Eur. J. Hum.

Overexpressing ChREBP in primary hepatocytes induces activity of the ChoRE-containing PK promoter in high glucose conditions but not in low glucose conditions (20Yamashita H. Takenoshita M.

However, ChREBP does not effectively homodimerize or bind to the ChoREs as a homodimer (22Cairo S. Merla G. Urbinati F. Ballabio A. Reymond A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 617-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Stoeckman A.K. Ma L. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15662-15669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Using a yeast-two hybrid screen, Max-like protein X (Mlx) was identified as a bHLH/LZ protein in liver that interacts with the bHLH/LZ domain of ChREBP (24Stoeckman A.K. Ma L. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15662-15669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Mlx is a member of the Myc/Max/Mad family of transcription factors, and similar to Max, it can serve as a common interaction partner of a transcription factor network (25Billin A.N. Eilers A.L. Queva C. Ayer D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36344-36350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Meroni G. Cairo S. Merla G. Messali S. Brent R. Ballabio A. Reymond A.

In addition to ChREBP, Mlx can also interact with Mad1, Mnt, Mad4, and MondoA (a paralog of ChREBP) (25Billin A.N. Eilers A.L. Queva C. Ayer D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36344-36350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Meroni G. Cairo S. Merla G. Messali S. Brent R. Ballabio A. Reymond A.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8845-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, no target genes have been identified for Mlx and these heterodimeric partners. Recently, we demonstrated that ChREBP can bind to various ChoREs only in the presence of Mlx (24Stoeckman A.K. Ma L. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15662-15669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of ChoRE-containing promoters depends upon both ChREBP and Mlx in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (24Stoeckman A.K. Ma L. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15662-15669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The correlation between the binding and functional data suggested that Mlx is a functional interaction partner of ChREBP. However, 293 cells are not glucose-responsive. Whether ChREBP and Mlx function together to directly regulate the glucose-responsive lipogenic enzyme genes remains a question. To further explore the role of ChREBP·Mlx in the glucose-signaling pathway, we developed dominant negative forms of Mlx to block the function of ChREBP in the context of a glucose-responsive cell environment. In this report we provide evidence supporting a direct role of ChREBP·Mlx heterodimer in regulating glucose-responsive genes in liver and supporting an obligatory role for Mlx in this process. Primary Hepatocyte Culture and Transfection—Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300 g) were fed ad libitum, and primary hepatocytes were isolated by the collagenase perfusion method described previously (29Kaytor E.N. Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). After a 3-h attachment to 35-mm Primaria plates, cells were transduced with recombinant adenovirus for 2 h in Williams' E medium containing 5.5 mm glucose, 23 mm HEPES, 0.01 μm dexamethasone, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 26 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 0.1 unit/ml insulin (low glucose medium). Cells were then transfected using F1 reagent (Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA) with a mixture of a firefly luciferase reporter driven by an ACC ChoRE-containing promoter region (18O'Callaghan B.L. Koo S.-H. Wu Y. Freake H.C. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16033-16039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and an internal control plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase (pRL-CMV, Promega). In some experiments expression plasmids for ChREBP, Mlx, or MondoA were cotransfected with the reporter plasmid mixture. Expression plasmids for mouse ChREBP and Mlx were described previously (24Stoeckman A.K. Ma L. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15662-15669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The human MondoA cDNA in the pcDNA3.1 vector was obtained form Dr. Donald Ayers, University of Utah, and contained a C-terminal His tag (28Billin A.N. Eilers A.L. Coulter K.L. Logan J.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8845-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Four hours after transfection, Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) was added at 667 μg/35-mm plate, and cells were kept in low glucose medium for 24-36 h to allow expression of recombinant protein. Cells were then maintained in low glucose medium or switched to high (27.5 mm) glucose medium for an additional 24 h. Hepatocytes were harvested using Promega Passive Lysis buffer. Luciferase assays were performed using the Promega dual-luciferase assay system kit. Results of luciferase assays are expressed as relative firefly light units/Renilla light units. For experiments in which RNA was extracted, the procedure was identical except no transfections were performed. 293 Cell Culture and Transfections—Experiments were performed in a similar manner as previously described (24Stoeckman A.K. Ma L. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15662-15669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. For whole cell extracts used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), 293 cells were transfected in 100-mm plates using the calcium phosphate method. We transfected 7.5 μg each of plasmids expressing double mutant ChREBP (S196A/T666A) (24Stoeckman A.K. Ma L. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15662-15669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and Mlx with 22.5 μg of either form of dominant negative Mlx or empty vector plasmids into 293 cells. Whole cell lysate was prepared from cells 40 h post-transfection using the whole cell extract protocol in the nuclear extract kit from ActiveMotif (Carlsbad, CA). EMSAs—EMSAs were conducted as described previously (30Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9380-9387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical reaction contained 100,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide and 5 μg of whole cell extract from 293 cells. For reactions with antibodies, proteins were first incubated with antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Liver nuclear extracts were prepared from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (11Koo S.-H. Dutcher A.K. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9437-9445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Antibodies to Mlx and USF1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; FLAG and HA antibodies were purchased from Sigma. After incubation with oligonucleotide for 30 min at room temperature, samples were loaded and separated on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Results were obtained by phosphorimaging analysis. Construction of Recombinant Adenovirus—Dominant negative Mlx plasmids were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The starting plasmid was a 5′-FLAG-tagged Mlxβ cDNA described previously (24Stoeckman A.K. Ma L. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15662-15669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Adenovirus constructs were prepared according to the Qbiogene AdenoVator kit. Both dominant negative Mlx forms, wild type Mlx and ChREBP, were first cloned into the transfer vector (pAdenoVator-CMV5-IRES-GFP). The cDNA of the clone was linearized with PmeI and cotransformed with a plasmid containing the partial adenoviral genome (pAdenoVator ΔE1/ΔE3) into BJ5183 bacterial cells. Colonies were selected and screened by plasmid size and restriction enzyme analysis. The recombined plasmid was linearized with PacI and transfected into 293 cells. In 4-10 days, cell lysates containing virus were collected. PCR was performed using the viral DNA to confirm the presence of appropriate sequences. Viruses were titrated by immunofluorescence microscopy using the GFP gene integrated into the adenoviral genome. Measurement of mRNAs by Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Concentrations of RNA were measured spectrophotometrically at A260. Real time reverse transcription-PCR was performed in two steps. First, RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the iScript kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCR was then performed on the Icycler real-time PCR detection system using iQ SYBR Green Supermix kit (Bio-Rad). Primers were designed using the software Beacon Designer (Bio-Rad). Primer information is available upon request. The results of reverse transcription-PCR were expressed as the -fold induction by normalizing the mean of the threshold cycle values from treated hepatocyte samples to the mean of the threshold cycle values from low glucose untreated or GFP virus-treated hepatocyte samples. All samples were analyzed in triplicate and expressed as the mean ± S.D. Immunoblot Analysis—Protein from hepatocyte crude extract or 293 cells was boiled in reducing buffer and separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred onto an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride 0.45-μm filter membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Dominant negative Mlx was detected with the M2 mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). MondoA was detected using a mouse monoclonal to polyhistidine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Signals were detected using an ECL Western blot detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of Lactate Levels—Hepatocytes were treated the same as for the total RNA preparation. Hepatocytes were transduced with either control virus or dominant negative virus for 2 h and then maintained in low glucose conditions for 36 h. Cells were then cultured in either low or high glucose conditions, and samples of medium were collected at 4, 8, 12, and 24 h to measure lactate levels. Lactate levels were measured using the lactate reagent kit (Sigma). Construction of Dominant Negative Mlx—Several lines of evidence have implicated ChREBP·Mlx as the critical factor affording glucose-responsive transcription to ChoRE-containing genes in hepatocytes. We sought to obtain definitive evidence in this regard. Testing the function of ChREBP and Mlx by overexpression is complicated by the presence of the endogenous proteins in hepatocytes. Alternatively, the role of these factors in the glucose-signaling pathway can be evaluated by inhibiting their function. For this purpose, we constructed dominant negative forms of Mlx. Three different spliced Mlx isoforms, α, β, γ, are widely expressed and capable of heterodimerizing with ChREBP (25Billin A.N. Eilers A.L. Queva C. Ayer D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36344-36350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Meroni G. Cairo S. Merla G. Messali S. Brent R. Ballabio A. Reymond A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3266-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because Mlxβ is the most abundant form in liver (26Meroni G. Cairo S. Merla G. Messali S. Brent R. Ballabio A. Reymond A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3266-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), two dominant negative Mlxβ constructs were prepared. In the first dominant negative, the entire basic region of 13 amino acids was deleted (Mlx Δb). In the second construct, two basic residues that are conserved in the basic region of the bHLH/LZ family were mutated to non-basic residues (Mlx b/a) (Fig. 1A). These two mutant forms should be able to heterodimerize with ChREBP because their HLH/LZ domains are intact. However, the resulting heterodimers should not bind to DNA because of the mutations in the basic region. To ensure that these dominant negative Mlx forms block DNA binding of ChREBP·Mlx, we performed an EMSA experiment in which equal amounts of ChREBP and wild type Mlx expression plasmids were co-transfected into 293 cells alone or with a 3-fold excess of each dominant Mlx form. A double mutant (S196A/T666A) ChREBP was used in this experiment because it enhances DNA binding to the ChoREs (24Stoeckman A.K. Ma L. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15662-15669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). As predicted, both dominant negative Mlx forms interfere with the binding of ChREBP·Mlx to the ChoRE sequence, with the Mlx b/a form somewhat more effective than the Mlx Δb form (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the mutant Mlx forms should block the function of ChREBP·Mlx in regulating their target genes in hepatocytes. Dominant Negative Mlx Forms Inhibit the Glucose Response of a ChoRE-containing Promoter—To evaluate the role of ChREBP·Mlx in mediating the glucose response, dominant negative forms of Mlx were introduced into adenoviral expression vectors. Both dominant negative Mlx proteins were expressed in hepatocytes after the transduction of recombinant adenovirus into primary hepatocytes (Fig. 1C). To test their effect on a glucose-responsive promoter, increasing amounts of either dominant negative Mlx virus were transduced into hepatocytes. Subsequently, cells were transfected with a reporter containing multiple copies of the ChoRE from the ACC promoter region (18O'Callaghan B.L. Koo S.-H. Wu Y. Freake H.C. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16033-16039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because this reporter plasmid contains only the ChoRE element and the basal promoter, it provides a direct readout for the glucose-responsive transcription factor. Cells were kept in low (5.5 mm) glucose medium for 36 h to allow the expression of the dominant negative Mlx protein and then incubated in either low or high (27.5 mm) glucose medium for 24 h. Insulin was present throughout the experiment at fixed levels, so that any changes in promoter activity would be due to altered glucose levels. In the absence of virus, reporter gene activity was greatly elevated in cells cultured in high glucose conditions. However, both forms of dominant negative Mlx progressively inhibited the ACC ChoRE promoter activity in high glucose conditions (Fig. 2). As a control, we used a virus containing the coding sequences for an unrelated protein, GFP. Expression of this protein did not inhibit the glucose response, indicating that transduction by the adenoviral vector does not interfere with the glucose-signaling pathway. Although there was a modest increase in activity in high glucose conditions with the GFP-expressing virus, this was not routinely observed. Therefore, both dominant negative Mlx forms efficiently block the glucose response of ChoRE-containing promoter activity by inhibiting the endogenous ChREBP·Mlx heterodimer from binding to the ChoRE. Overexpression of Wild Type ChREBP or Mlx Can Compensate for the Effect of Dominant Negative Mlx—Mlx can interact with several other bHLH/LZ proteins in addition to ChREBP (25Billin A.N. Eilers A.L. Queva C. Ayer D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36344-36350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Meroni G. Cairo S. Merla G. Messali S. Brent R. Ballabio A. Reymond A.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8845-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Consequently, we wanted to ensure that the inhibition of the glucose response by dominant negative Mlx is the result of binding to endogenous ChREBP instead of another bHLH/LZ protein. Hepatocytes were treated with dominant negative Mlx virus or control virus expressing GFP for 2 h. Increasing amounts of adenovirus expressing wild type ChREBP were transduced with the dominant negative Mlx virus. The ACC ChoRE-containing reporter was then transfected into these cells. After incubation in low glucose conditions for 36 h, the media was either maintained in low glucose or changed to high glucose for 24 h to induce the glucose response. The addition of increasing amounts of wild type ChREBP progressively rescued the glucose response of the hepatocytes treated with the dominant negative Mlx in high glucose conditions (Fig. 3A). Little or no effect was observed in low glucose conditions. Control adenovirus did not induce the glucose response in the presence of dominant negative Mlx. Similarly, adenovirus expressing the bHLH/LZ factor SREBP-1c (12Stoeckman A.K. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27029-27035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) was unable to restore a glucose response. 2L. Ma, N. G. Tsatsos, and H. C. Towle, unpublished observations. Consequently, inhibition of the glucose response by dominant negative Mlx appears to be the result of blocking ChREBP function. The ability of dominant negative Mlx to inhibit the glucose response in hepatocytes presumably results from its overexpression relative to the endogenous Mlx gene. Hence, the majority of endogenous ChREBP would be bound to the dominant negative Mlx protein rather than endogenous Mlx. If ChREBP·Mlx is the active glucose-responsive complex, then increasing the expression of wild type Mlx in the presence of a fixed amount of dominant negative Mlx should be able to overcome the inhibition as well. To test this possibility, we carried out a rescue experiment with wild type Mlx. As a control, we used the ChREBP paralog, MondoA. This bHLH/LZ protein also heterodimerizes with Mlx. However, there is no evidence indicating that MondoA functions in a glucose-responsive manner, and it lacks several amino acid residues found critical for the response of ChREBP to glucose (28Billin A.N. Eilers A.L. Coulter K.L. Logan J.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8845-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Li Y. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3B, expressing increasing amounts of an Mlx expression plasmid in cells previously transduced with the dominant negative Mlx does indeed lead to a restoration of the glucose response. However, cells expressing the Mlx partner MondoA remain unresponsive to glucose. To ensure that the MondoA expression plasmid was capable of producing the full-length protein, this plasmid was introduced into 293 cells, and extracts were immunoblotted to detect the His-tagged MondoA. A band running just above the marker of 105 kilodaltons was detected in these extracts, indicating that MondoA was indeed produced. These experiments support the conclusion that ChREBP functions in a heteromeric complex with Mlx to provide a glucose-responsive transcription factor.

De Luca V. John R.I. Romeo T. Varin L. De Luca V. Recent Advances in Phytochemistry, Evolution of Metabolic Pathways. 34. Elsevier Science, Oxford2000: 285-315Google Scholar). The name BAHD is coined from the first four enzymes of the family isolated from plant species. The members of this family play an important role in the biosynthesis of a variety of secondary metabolites. The family might become significantly larger in the near future because ∼70 BAHD-related genes have been identified recently in the Arabidopsis genome (2.Dudareva N. Pichersky E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), and in most cases, their biochemical function still needs to be explored. Several BAHD members occurring in medicinal plants and fungi play very specific metabolic roles in biosynthetic pathways. The most prominent members are, for instance, those participating in the biosynthesis of the Catharanthus alkaloid vindoline (3.St-Pierre B. Laflamme P. Alarco A.-M. De Luca V. Plant J. 1998; 14: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), a precursor of the anti-cancer drugs vincaleucoblastine and vincristine, the Papaver alkaloid morphine (4.Grothe T. Lenz R.

Plant J. 2004; 38: 994-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as well as some phytoalexins (11.Yang Q. Reinhard K. Schiltz E. Matern U. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 777-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and enzymes involved in floral scent (12.Dudareva N. D'Auria J.C. Nam K.H. Raguso R.A. Pichersky E. Plant J. 1998; 14: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).A well-characterized enzyme of this family is vinorine synthase (VS; EC 2.3.1.160), which is of central importance in the endogenous formation of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids of the ajmalan type in the plant genus Rauvolfia. The synthase is located in the middle of the complex biosynthetic pathway that starts with tryptamine and the monoterpene secologanin and leads, finally, to the six-membered ring system of ajmaline that bears nine chiral carbon atoms (Fig. 1). Ajmaline is an antiarrhythmic drug from the Indian plant Rauvolfia serpentina, which has been known as a medicinal plant for about 3000 years. VS catalyzes the acetyl-CoA-dependent reversible biosynthesis of the ajmalan-type alkaloid vinorine from the alkaloid 16-epi-vellosimine. The latter belongs to the class of sarpagan alkaloids containing a five-ring system, and this is the final ring closure reaction during the biosynthesis of ajmaline (Fig. 1). VS connects the two different types of alkaloids biosynthetically and occupies a central role in the metabolism of alkaloids in the genus Rauvolfia.VS has been identified previously in de-differentiated cell suspension cultures of R. serpentina and preliminarily characterized (13.Pfitzner A. Polz L. Stöckigt J. Z. Naturforsch. 1986; 41c: 103-114Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Only recently has it been functionally expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity (14.Gerasimenko I. Ma X.Y. Sheludko Y. Mentele R. Lottspeich F. Stöckigt J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 2781-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15.Bayer A. Ma X.Y. Stöckigt J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 2787-2795Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The synthase is a monomeric enzyme with a molecular mass of 46.8 kDa. Knowledge of the primary structure of the enzyme allowed sequence alignment studies placing VS into the BAHD family as a new member (15.Bayer A. Ma X.Y. Stöckigt J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 2787-2795Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This classification was based on the consensus sequences HXXXD and DFGWG. The typically low overall sequence identity (25–34%) to other BAHD members might indicate a divergent evolution of the family from one ancestral gene (1.St-Pierre B. De Luca V. John R.I. Romeo T. Varin L. De Luca V. Recent Advances in Phytochemistry, Evolution of Metabolic Pathways. 34. Elsevier Science, Oxford2000: 285-315Google Scholar). Some functional significance of both motifs has been demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis performed on a malonyl-CoA transferring plant enzyme (9.Suzuki H. Nakayama T. Nishino T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1764-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and more detailed mutation studies have been carried out on vinorine synthase (15.Bayer A. Ma X.Y. Stöckigt J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 2787-2795Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The results showed, however, that a better understanding of the catalytic process and the function of the conserved residues would be best addressed by three-dimensional structural analysis. Because there was no structural information available from members of this enzyme family, we have crystallized vinorine synthase from R. serpentina (16.Ma X.Y. Koepke J. Bayer A. Linhard V.

Y., Koepke, J., Bayer, A., Fritzsch, G., Michel, H., and Stöckigt, J. (2005) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr., in pressGoogle Scholar) and solved the x-ray crystal structure at 2.6-Å resolution. Structural analysis combined with previously reported biochemical and mutagenesis studies allows us to propose a model for VS catalysis and provides insight into the function of conserved motifs within the BAHD superfamily.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOverexpression, Purification, and Crystallization of VS—VS was subcloned into the pQE-2 vector and overexpressed in E. coli. The soluble protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography, anion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography as described previously. The N-terminal His tag was removed for crystallization (15.Bayer A. Ma X.Y. Stöckigt J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 2787-2795Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16.Ma X.Y. Koepke J. Bayer A. Linhard V. Fritzsch G. Zhang B. Michel H. Stöckigt J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1701: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Crystals of VS were obtained at 32 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir solution contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, 2 m ammonium sulfate, and 2% polyethylene glycol 400. The enzyme (2–3 mg/ml) was in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm acetyl-CoA. SeMet VS was obtained by inhibition of the methionine biosynthetic pathway (18.Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) with the same expression vector and E. coli strain used for expression of the native VS. Purification and crystallization of SeMet VS were carried out using a protocol similar to that used for wild-type VS (17.Ma, X. Y., Koepke, J., Bayer, A., Fritzsch, G., Michel, H., and Stöckigt, J. (2005) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr., in pressGoogle Scholar).Data Collection and Processing—Both SeMet VS and native VS crystals were cryoprotected by addition of 20–25% glycerol to the precipitant buffer before being flash-cooled in a stream of cold nitrogen at 100 K. Native data and multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction data from SeMet VS crystals measured at three different wavelengths around the selenium absorption edge were collected using synchrotron radiation on the BW7A beamline of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory at the DORIS storage ring of the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany). The SeMet crystals diffracted to 3.24 Å, whereas the native crystals diffracted to 2.60 Å. The diffraction data were processed using the HKL program package (19.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the space group P212121 with two molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination, Model Building, and Refinement—The structure was solved using the three wavelength multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction protocol of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Hamburg automated crystal structure determination platform (20.Panjikar, S., Parthasarathy, V., Lamzin, V., Weiss, M. S., and Tucker, P. A. (2005) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr., in pressGoogle Scholar). Within the platform, positions of the anomalous scattering atoms were determined with the program SHELXD (21.Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar), and 18 Se sites were further refined using MLPHARE (22.Collaborative Computation Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar) to generate initial phases. Phase improvement by density modification was performed using DM (23.Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). The platform provided the correct selenium sites and an interpretable map with a partial α-helical model containing 167 of 842 residues. The partial model was produced by the program ESSENS (24.Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) within the platform.Once the map was judged to be interpretable, 50% of the polyalanine model was built using a semiautomatic procedure with the programs MAID (25.Levitt D.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), RESOLVE (26.Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and XTALVIEW/XFIT (27.McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Later, phases were extended to 2.6 Å using data from the native crystal by density modification and 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging. Manual model building was continued using XTALVIEW/XFIT, and a relatively complete polyalanine model was built into the improved density. The selenium sites were used as markers to place the correct side chains in the electron density, and building of most of the side chains of a single molecule was possible. The second molecule was then generated using the non-crystallographic symmetry operator. At this stage, refinement of the structure was initiated using simulated annealing, followed by positional and restrained B-factor refinement as implemented in CNS (28.Brünger A.V. Adams P.P. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). The geometry and completeness of the model was iteratively improved by refinement with CNS using simulated annealing and torsion angle dynamics protocol and manual building. In the final stage, refinement was carried out using non-crystallographic symmetry restraints, bulk solvent correction, and anisotropic scaling, with each domain of each monomer defined as a TLS group in the modeling of anisotropy using the program REFMAC5 (29.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13781) Google Scholar, 30.Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). The refinement was monitored throughout using the free R-factor calculated with 3.2% of the unique reflections. Of 421 residues, 8 residues in chain A and 9 residues in chain B are not visible in the electron density (see “Results”) and are probably disordered. The acetyl-CoA could not be located in the electron density, hence these crystals are referred to here as native crystals. The refinement statistics for the native structure are shown in Table I.The overall geometric quality of the model was assessed using PRO-CHECK (31.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). 87.7% of the amino acid residues of VS were found in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot, and no residues were in the disallowed regions. All figures were produced using MOLSCRIPT (32.Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), PyMOL (33.De Lano W.L. PyMOL. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar), and RASTER3D (34.Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar).Modeling of CoA—The structural similarity of VS to the CoA-dependent acyltransferase family was used to model CoA into the active site of VS. Because the structure of dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (Protein Data Bank code 1EAD) has been solved in complex with CoA (35.Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Schulze E. Kalk K.H. Westphal A.H. de Kok A. Hol W.G. Science. 1992; 255: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), this protein was used as the basis for the modeling of the CoA molecule in VS. The dihydrolipoyl transacetylase trimer binds CoA in the solvent channel that is located at the interface of two subunits. The two subunits of dihydrolipoyl transacetylase are analogous to a single monomer of the VS structure that contains two domains. Both structures were superimposed in order to provide a starting model for the VS·CoA complex. To improve the accuracy of positioning CoA, all residues within a 4-Å distance of CoA in the molecules were selected using the program CONTACT (22.Collaborative Computation Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar), and these residues were superimposed with an r.m.s.d. of 1.8 Å onto corresponding residues in VS using the program LSQKAB (22.Collaborative Computation Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). The matrix was applied to the CoA molecule in Protein Data Bank code 1EAD in order to transfer CoA into the solvent channel of the VS structure. A model of a single molecule of VS with the fitted CoA was then subjected to model refinement in CNS (28.Brünger A.V. Adams P.P. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar), excluding the x-ray terms. The resulting model was then used for further analysis.RESULTSStructure Determination of VS—The structure of VS was solved by the multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction method using selenomethionine substituted VS. The crystals formed in space group P212121 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The model was refined to a final crystallographic R-value of 21.1% (Rfree = 27.2%), using data from 20.0- to 2.6-Å resolution. The presented atomic model of VS shows all residues except N-terminal residues 1–3 from both molecules in the asymmetric unit and a surface loop (residues 235–239 for A molecule and 235–240 for B molecule). The crystallographic information is summarized in Table I. The contacts among the non-crystallographic symmetry-related dimers in the crystals are generally weak and hydrophilic in nature. The structural observations are consistent with biochemical data that VS is active as monomer as determined previously by size exclusion chromatography (14.Gerasimenko I. Ma X.Y. Sheludko Y. Mentele R. Lottspeich F. Stöckigt J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 2781-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Overall Structure of VS—The structure of VS contains 14 β-strands (β1-β14) and 13 helices (α1-α13) and consists of two approximately equal-sized domains. The domains are connected with a large crossover loop (residues 201–213) that spans nearly 36 Å. Domain 1 contains a mixed 6-stranded β-sheet (β1-β2, β5-β7, β12), which is covered on both sides by 7 helices (α1–α7) (Fig. 2). Strand 12 (residues 370–372) protrudes out from domain 2 and forms part of an anti-parallel sheet in domain 1. Domain 1 also contains a pair of β-strands (β3 and β4) on the surface of the protein at one end of the central β-sheet. Domain 2 contains 6 helices and a mixed 6-stranded β-sheet (β8-β11, β13-β14). A loop from domain 2 between β-strands 9 and 10 extends into domain 1 and contacts α6. Domain 1 and domain 2 share a very similar polypeptide backbone fold; however, their topology is different. Their backbones can be aligned to within 3.1-Å r.m.s.d. over 85 amino acids. The secondary elements that correspond in the two domains include the 6-stranded β-sheet and two α-helices (α2 in domain 1 and α9 in domain 2). The sequence identity among these aligned positions is rather low, with only seven pairs of identical residues (8.2%).Fig. 2Structure of vinorine synthase. A and B represent orthogonal views of the VS structure as depicted in ribbon representation. N and C denote the termini of VS. The secondary structure elements are labeled (α1–α13 and β1– β14), and domains 1 and 2 are indicated. The α-helices are shown in orange, and the β-strands are shown in cyan.

The first loop is located between the two parallel strands β11 and β13 of domain 2 and includes strand β12 of domain 1. A second loop is situated between β9 and β10. The DFGWG and GN motifs in the first and second loop, respectively, are absolutely conserved throughout the BAHD superfamily (Fig. 4). The active site HXXXD sequence motif in the VS structure is located at the interface between the two domains, and the catalytic residue His160 of this motif is accessible from both sides of the channel (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Surface representation of vinorine synthase with CoA modeled into the solvent-accessible channel.

The closest structure to VS is the polyketide synthase-associated protein 5 (Pap5; Protein Data Bank code 1Q9J) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which was aligned to 2.58-Å r.m.s.d. over 277 amino acids with 14% sequence identity. Other proteins that can be aligned to the VS structure include condensation domains of vibriobactin synthetase (VibH; Protein Data Bank code 1L5A, 3.5-Å r.m.s.d. over 262 amino acids with 7% sequence identity), rat choline acetyltransferase (Protein Data Bank code 1Q6X, 3.7-Å r.m.s.d. over 244 amino acids with 10% sequence identity), and human carnitine acetyltransferase (Protein Data Bank code 1NM8, 3.6-Å r.m.s.d. over 236 amino acids with 10% sequence identity). The two structurally related VS domains also show structural similarity with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (Protein Data Bank code 1CLA, 2.75-Å r.m.s.d over 114 amino acids with 10% sequence identity aligned with VS domain 1 and 3.32-Å r.m.s.d. over 133 amino acids with 5% sequence identity aligned with VS domain 2) and dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (Protein Data Bank code 1EAD, 3.75-Å r.m.s.d. over 106 amino acids with 7% sequence identity aligned with VS domain 1 and 3.29-Å r.m.s.d. over 129 amino acids with 9% sequence identity aligned with VS domain 2). All of these aligned proteins are CoA-dependent acyltransferases and contain the conserved HXXXD motif in the active site. In all these acyltransferases except VibH, His of this motif plays a critical role in the CoA-dependent acyltransfer reaction mechanism (35.Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Schulze E. Kalk K.H.

https://openalex.org/W2120717648,"Activity-dependent secretion of BDNF is important in mediating synaptic plasticity, but how it is achieved is unclear. Here we uncover a sorting motif receptor-mediated mechanism for regulated secretion of BDNF. X-ray crystal structure analysis revealed a putative sorting motif, I16E18I105D106, in BDNF, which when mutated at the acidic residues resulted in missorting of proBDNF to the constitutive pathway in AtT-20 cells. A V20E mutation to complete a similar motif in NGF redirected a significant proportion of it from the constitutive to the regulated pathway. Modeling and binding studies showed interaction of the acidic residues in the BDNF motif with two basic residues in the sorting receptor, carboxypeptidase E (CPE). 35S labeling experiments demonstrated that activity-dependent secretion of BDNF from cortical neurons was obliterated in CPE knockout mice. Thus, we have identified a mechanism whereby a specific motif I16E18I105D106 interacts with CPE to sort proBDNF into regulated pathway vesicles for activity-dependent secretion."

Whether this phenomenon contributes to the physiological effects of APC is unknown. Toward answering this question, we compared the kinetics of PAR1 cleavage on endothelial cells by APC versus thrombin. APC did cleave PAR1 on the endothelial surface, and antibodies to the endothelial protein C receptor inhibited such cleavage. Importantly, however, APC was ∼104-fold less potent than thrombin in this setting. APC and thrombin both triggered PAR1-mediated responses in endothelial cells including expression of antiapoptotic (tumor necrosis factor-α-induced a20 and iap-1) and chemokine (interleukin-8 (il-8) and cxcl3) genes, but again, APC was ∼104-fold less potent than thrombin. The addition of zymogen protein C to endothelial cultures did not alter the rate of PAR1 cleavage at low or high concentrations of thrombin, and PAR1 cleavage was substantial at thrombin concentrations too low to trigger detectable conversion of protein C to APC. Thus, locally generated APC did not contribute to PAR1 cleavage beyond that effected by thrombin in this system. Although consistent with reports that sufficiently high concentrations of APC can cleave and activate PAR1 in culture, our data suggest that a significant physiological role for PAR1 activation by APC is unlikely.

Chest. 2003; 124: 26S-32SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Thrombin serves as the central effector of the coagulation cascade by converting fibrinogen to fibrin and by activating platelets and other cells through protease-activated receptors (PARs) (2.Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar, 3.Camerer E. Duong D.N. Hamilton J.R. Coughlin S.R. Blood. 2004; 103: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PAR1, the prototype for this receptor family, is a heptahelical G protein-coupled receptor for thrombin (4.Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). Activation of PAR1 is accomplished when thrombin binds to and cleaves the N-terminal exodomain of PAR1 at a specific site. This cleavage generates a new receptor N terminus and thereby unmasks a “tethered ligand” that binds to the heptahelical segment of the receptor to effect transmembrane signaling and G protein activation. Importantly, cleavage of the activation site of PAR1 is both necessary and sufficient for receptor activation, and several proteases with trypsin-like specificity are capable of cleaving this site and activating PAR1 in vitro (5.Brass L.F.

Thrombin converts zymogen protein C to APC, which in turn cleaves and inactivates coagulation factors Va and VIIIa, cofactors necessary for thrombin production (1.Esmon C.T. Chest. 2003; 124: 26S-32SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Generation of APC is localized to the surface of endothelial cells by the action of two integral membrane cofactors, thrombomodulin (TM) and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), which bind thrombin and protein C, respectively (8.Esmon N.L. Owen W.G. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 859-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mollica J.S. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Interest in the natural anticoagulant and other biological activities of APC has intensified due to the recent finding that APC administration can reduce mortality in sepsis (10.Bernard G.R. Vincent J.L. Laterre P.F. LaRosa S.P. Dhainaut J.F. Lopez-Rodriguez A. Steingrub J.S. Garber G.E. Helterbrand J.D. Ely E.W. Fisher Jr., C.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (4987) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was reported that APC is capable of activating PAR1 on endothelial cells, and it was postulated that this phenomenon might contribute to the protective effect of APC in sepsis (11.Riewald M.

Many PAR1-triggered responses in endothelial cells, such as production of platelet-activating factor and chemokines and display of adhesion molecules for leukocytes and platelets, would be predicted to promote inflammation, thrombosis, and tissue damage (13.Zimmerman G.A.

Chest. 2003; 124: 26S-32SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Might APC contribute to PAR1 activation beyond that already effected by thrombin? Might APC versus thrombin activation of PAR1 somehow favor protective versus proinflammatory responses in endothelial cells? Toward addressing these questions, we have compared the kinetics and the effects of endothelial PAR1 activation by thrombin versus APC. Our results militate against an important role for APC in PAR1 signaling. Materials—Reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Human thrombin was from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). APC was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories or prepared from plasma-derived protein C as described (22.Esmon C. Esmon N. Le Bonniec B. Johnson A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 359-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The activities of APC from the two sources were indistinguishable in the presence of hirudin (see below). Zymogen protein C was from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). The chromogenic APC substrate, Spectrozyme PCa (H-d-Lys (γ-Cbo)-pro-Arg-pNA.2AcOH), was from American Diagnostica (Stamford, CT). Recombinant hirudin was from American Diagnostica or Calbiochem. SFLLRN peptide was synthesized as a C-terminal amide and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (ANASPEC, San Jose, CA). Cells, cell culture media, and accompanying supplements were from the University of California, San Francisco Cell Culture Facility unless otherwise specified. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibodies against EPCR, JRK1494 (blocking), and JRK1500 (non-blocking) were generated and characterized as described (9.Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mollica J.S. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Plasmid cDNAs—AP-PAR1 encodes secreted human placental alkaline phosphatase fused to human PAR1 at Ala-36 with an intervening linker region containing the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDD). The amino acid sequence of the fusion region reads:... AAHPGLQDYKDDDDVD-ATLDPR↓SFLLR... where the alkaline phosphatase sequence is underlined, - marks the linker junction to native PAR1 sequence shown in bold, and ↓ indicates the thrombin cleavage site. Additionally, sequence 5′ of secreted human placental alkaline phosphatase Ile-18 codon had been replaced with a secretory sequence derived from mast cell growth factor that included a Myc epitope tag. AP-PAR1 cDNA was inserted into the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), at HindIII/NotI cloning sites (23.Ludeman M.J. Zheng Y.W. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18592-18599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells, Cell Culture, and PAR1 Cleavage Assays—All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) or Cascade (Seatle, WA), were maintained in Clonetics EGM-2 complete medium and cultured on 0.1% gelatin coated Falcon cell culture 24-well plates (BD Biosciences). All assays for cleavage of AP-PAR1 expressed in HUVECs were conducted at 37 °C. In experiments in which receptor cleavage by APC versus thrombin was measured, HUVECs (P5 or P6) were transiently transfected at 80–85% confluency in 24-well plates with AP-PAR1 in antibiotic-free EGM-2 complete medium using the polyamine transfection reagent, TransIT-LT (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer's instructions. On the following day, the cells were washed and incubated in serum-free medium (M199 with 15 mm HEPES, 0.1% BSA brought to 2 mm calcium (final concentration)) for 5 h and then washed again prior to the addition of APC or thrombin. Conditioned medium was collected at the indicated times, and soluble alkaline phosphatase released by PAR1 cleavage was measured (see below). Data were expressed as the difference between soluble alkaline phosphatase activity measured in medium conditioned by cells in the presence of protease minus activity in medium conditioned by cells incubated for the same time in the absence of protease. The latter “background activity” was less than 2% of the level stimulated by thrombin at the 6-min time point and less than 10% at 60 min. This background activity was dependent upon transfection of cells with AP-PAR1 (virtually no soluble alkaline phosphatase activity was detected in untransfected cultures) and likely represents low level basal metalloproteinase-dependent shedding of PAR1 N-terminal exodomain that occurs in this system (23.Ludeman M.J. Zheng Y.W. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18592-18599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because APC preparations can be contaminated by thrombin, all APC solutions were preincubated with hirudin (2 units/ml final concentration) for 10–15 min before being added to cells. Hirudin had no effect on the activity of Spectrozyme PCa cleavage by APC preparations. In experiments in which anti-EPCR antibodies were used, cells were preincubated with the indicated antibodies (50 μg/ml) in serum-free medium for 15–20 min prior to the addition of agonist. In experiments in which receptor cleavage was measured in the presence of zymogen protein C, cells were preincubated with serum-free medium containing protein C or medium alone for 15–20 min prior to the addition of thrombin. In experiments in which receptor cleavage and conversion of protein C to APC were both measured, cells were preincubated with HEPES-buffered saline solution plus 0.1% BSA, 3 mm calcium, and 0.6 mm magnesium instead of serum-free medium, in the presence or absence of protein C for 15–20 min prior to the addition of thrombin. After 1 h of thrombin treatment, conditioned medium was collected (225 μl of 300 μl total), centrifuged at 14,200 × g at 4 °C for 2 min; 50 μl of supernatant was assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity (see below), and 135 μl was assayed for APC activity as described (see below). Quantitation of Soluble Alkaline Phosphatase Released by PAR1 Cleavage—The amount of alkaline phosphatase liberated by cleavage of AP-PAR1 was determined as described (23.Ludeman M.J. Zheng Y.W.

Briefly, conditioned medium was collected after incubation of AP-PAR1-transfected HUVECs with APC or thrombin and centrifuged to remove any cell debris. Supernatant was collected, and alkaline phosphatase activity was measured using the chemiluminescent substrate, disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro {1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro) tricyclo(3.3.1.13,7)decan}-4-yl) phenyl phosphate. Subpicogram quantities of recombinant AP could be detected by this assay, and the relationship between chemiluminescence and protein was linear from 0.1 pg to at least 10 ng. Activity levels in the experiments presented here generally ranged from 1 to 30 pg. Background luminescence in medium conditioned by untransfected HUVECs was equivalent to less than 1 pg of alkaline phosphatase. Measurement of APC Activity—In experiments designed to assess protein C conversion to APC in culture, APC activity in conditioned medium was measured as described (9.Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mollica J.S. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Briefly, 135 μl of cleared conditioned HEPES-buffered saline solution medium was mixed with 15 μl of 40 units/ml hirudin (4 units/ml final concentration) to block any amidolytic activity that might be contributed by thrombin. 135 μl of this sample was in turn added to 15 μl of a solution containing the chromogenic APC substrate, Spectorzyme PCa, to give a final substrate concentration of 1 mm. The rate of change in absorbance with time (ΔOD at 405 nm/min) at room temperature was measured using a Vmax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The amount of APC present in samples was derived from a standard curve generated with purified APC, which was linear up to ∼45 nm APC. Detectable activation of protein C in this system was only observed when both thrombin and cells were present during the incubations. Phosphoinositide Hydrolysis—HUVECs were plated on gelatin-coated 24-well plates at 90–100% confluence and incubated overnight. Cells were then washed three times with serum-free DME and labeled with [3H]myoinositol (2 μCi/ml) in inositol-free DME/0.5% BSA for 14 h. After labeling, cells were washed once with DME/0.1% BSA and incubated for an additional 2 h in 200 μl of DME/0.1% BSA per well. 50 μl of DME/0.1% BSA with 100 mm LiCl containing varying concentrations of APC or thrombin with or without hirudin was then added, and cultures were incubated for an additional 1 h. Accumulated inositol phosphates were measured as described (24.Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern Blotting—Northern probes for IL-8, CXCL3, IAP-1, and A20 were amplified from the cDNA of thrombin-treated HUVECs using polymerase chain reaction. The specific sequences amplified were as follows: IAP-1, GenBank™ accession number U45878, nucleic acids 1484–2250; IL-8, accession number NM_000584, nucleic acids 85–499; CXCL3, accession number NM_002996, nucleic acids 269–960; and A20, accession number NM_006290, nucleic acids 1937–2446. Radiolabeled probes were generated using Prime-IT-II kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). HUVECs were plated on gelatin-coated 60-mm dishes, incubated in serum-free endothelial basal medium (Clonetics) (plus 0.1% BSA) for 14–16 h, and then further incubated with APC or thrombin for 120 min (IL-8 and CXCL3) or 90 min (IAP, A20); preliminary studies had shown that the maximum induction of each transcript occurred at these times. From each 60-mm dish, 10 μg of total RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen), separated by 1% agarose/10% formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond-NX Membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were hybridized in Perfect-Hybri solution (Sigma) with radiolabeled probes for 3 h at 68 °C, washed five times at room temperature (1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 10 min) and twice at 50 °C (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 15 min), and analyzed with a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). To directly compare the ability of APC and thrombin to cleave PAR1 on endothelial cells, we utilized a PAR1 cleavage reporter expressed in these cells. This substrate, AP-PAR1, is a chimeric protein in which the C terminus of secreted alkaline phosphatase (absent its transmembrane domain) is joined to the N-terminal exodomain of human PAR1 (absent its signal peptide). The junction between alkaline phosphatase and PAR1 is N-terminal to the thrombin cleavage site of PAR1 (23.Ludeman M.J. Zheng Y.W. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18592-18599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, alkaline phosphatase is tethered to the cell membrane by the N-terminal exodomain of PAR1 and released when this domain is cleaved by thrombin or other proteases, and soluble alkaline phosphatase activity in cell-conditioned medium provides an easily measured index of PAR1 cleavage (23.Ludeman M.J.

Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The range of thrombin concentrations explored in our AP-PAR1 cleavage studies was 10 pm to 30 nm. The level of prothrombin in the circulation is 1–2 μm, and concentrations of active thrombin in the 10 nm range are almost certainly physiologically relevant (26.Mann K.G. Brummel K. Butenas S. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1504-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The range of APC concentrations explored was 1–100 nm. The level of zymogen protein C in the circulation is ∼65–80 nm, and circulating APC levels are generally less than 0.2 nm even in sepsis (27.Macias W.L. Dhainaut J.F. Yan S.C. Helterbrand J.D. Seger M. Johnson III, G. Small D.S. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 72: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Incubation of AP-PAR1-expressing HUVECs for 1 h with 1 or 10 nm APC yielded little PAR1 cleavage, but at 100 nm APC, ∼20% of maximal PAR1 cleavage, defined as that caused by 10 nm thrombin, was detected (Fig. 1A). 0.01 nm thrombin yielded a similar amount of PAR1 cleavage under the same conditions, and ∼50% maximal PAR1 cleavage occurred at 0.1 nm thrombin. Thus, thrombin was ∼104-fold more potent than APC in this assay. In a second set of experiments, 30 nm thrombin yielded virtually complete cleavage of cell surface PAR1 within 6 min, 75 pm thrombin yielded ∼60% of maximal cleavage at 60 min, and 100 nm APC yielded only ∼30% maximal cleavage at 60 min (Fig. 1B). Again thrombin appeared to be 103-104-fold more potent than APC. The relatively low activity of APC versus thrombin raised the question of whether a small amount of thrombin contaminating APC preparations might contribute to the activity of APC seen in these studies. This is unlikely. In preliminary experiments, we had indeed found hirudin-inhibitable activity in some APC preparations, but in these cases, increasing concentrations of hirudin did not block all PAR1-cleaving activity. In all of the experiments shown, APC was preincubated with a concentration of hirudin sufficient to completely block 10 nm thrombin (this concentration of hirudin had no effect on APC as assessed by amidolytic activity (see “Experimental Procedures”)). In addition, the ability of APC to cleave endothelial PAR1 was inhibited by an antibody (JRK1494) that blocks protein C/APC binding to the EPCR but not by a non-blocking EPCR antibody (JRK1500); JRK1494 did not inhibit PAR1 cleavage by thrombin (Fig. 2 and data not shown). This finding is consistent with the observations of Riewald et al. (11.Riewald M. Petrovan R.J. Donner A. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. Science. 2002; 296: 1880-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) with regard to APC-triggered extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in endothelial cells. Thus, the low level of PAR1 cleaving activity in APC preparations is likely due to the actions of APC itself rather than by thrombin or other proteases that might contaminate such preparations. It was possible that the AP-PAR1 molecule was relatively resistant to APC cleavage when compared with wild-type PAR1. To test this possibility, we explored the APC concentration dependence of signaling in untransfected HUVECs in which signaling in response to thrombin and related proteases depends largely on native PAR1 (20.Ngaiza J.R. Jaffe E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1656-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 33.Woolkalis M.J. DeMelfi T.J. Blanchard N. Hoxie J.A. Brass L.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13502-13509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). As is apparent from the data in Figs. 3, 4, 5, activation of signaling in such cells required at least 1000-fold more APC than thrombin, in accord with the relative potency of APC and thrombin for AP-PAR1 cleavage. This result strongly suggests that the different potencies of thrombin and APC for cleavage of our AP-PAR1 chimera hold for cleavage and activation of wild-type PAR1. To further probe this issue, we assessed the rate of loss of SPAN12 binding to the surface of HUVECs exposed to thrombin or APC. SPAN12 is a monoclonal antibody to a thrombin-sensitive epitope that spans the activating cleavage site in PAR1 (35.Brass L.F. Pizarro S. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Bianchard N. Stadel J.M. Hoxie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2943-2952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of cells with 100 nm APC at 37 °C caused loss of ∼50% of SPAN12 binding in 30 min as assessed by flow cytometry; only 100 pm thrombin was required to achieve the same or greater effect. 10 nm thrombin reduced SPAN12 binding to background levels (data not shown). These results again suggest that APC is ∼1000-fold less potent than thrombin for cleavage and activation of PAR1 on endothelial cells.Fig. 4Induction of cxcl3 and il-8 gene expression in HUVECs by APC versus thrombin (αT). HUVECs were incubated with APC or thrombin ± hirudin (Hir.) for 120 min and CXCL3 (top band), and IL-8 (bottom band) mRNA levels were assessed by Northern blot. For quantitation, cxcl3 and il-8 band intensities were normalized to the band intensity for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, which was similar in all samples (not shown), and results were expressed as -fold increase over untreated cells.

Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This predicts that APC should be 103-104-fold less potent than thrombin for triggering PAR1-mediated responses in endothelial cells. To test this prediction, we first examined phosphoinositide hydrolysis as a convenient end point of PAR1 signaling (PAR1 is the major effector of thrombin-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in endothelial cells (21.Kataoka H. Hamilton J.R. McKemy D.D. Camerer E. Zheng Y.W. Cheng A. Griffin C. Coughlin S.R. Blood. 2003; 102: 3224-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 3). Increases in phosphoinositide hydrolysis were readily detected at thrombin concentrations of 0.1 nm and above. Responses to APC could be detected at 30 nm and above, and 100 nm APC triggered responses approximately equivalent to those elicited by 0.1 nm thrombin. Thus, in this functional assay, APC again appeared to be on the order of 103-fold less potent than thrombin. We next analyzed gene induction by thrombin and APC both as an additional end point for comparing the potency of these proteases for triggering PAR-mediated responses in endothelial cells and to probe for possible qualitative differences between thrombin and APC signaling in these cells. CXCL3 and IL-8, proinflammatory chemokines known to be induced by thrombin in endothelial cells (28.Ueno A. Murakami K. Yamanouchi K. Watanabe M. Kondo T. Immunology. 1996; 88: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar),2 were induced by both thrombin and APC in these cells; the response elicited by 100 nm APC was less than that elicited by 0.1 nm thrombin (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained when a20 and iap-1, two antiapoptotic genes known to be modulated by APC (16.Joyce D.E. Gelbert L. Ciaccia A. DeHoff B. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2107066838,"Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by a loss of lung epithelial cells, replaced by interstitial myofibroblasts to deposit extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Previous studies demonstrated that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) improved lung fibrosis in murine models, whereas molecular mechanisms whereby HGF improved lung fibrosis have yet to be fully understood. When MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts were treated with transforming growth factor-beta1, the cells underwent phenotypic change similar to myofibroblasts and this was associated with up-regulation of c-Met/HGF receptor expression. For the myofibroblast-like cells, HGF increased activities of MMP-2/-9, predominant enzymes for breakdown of fibronectin (FN). Under such conditions, HGF induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, linked with a decrease in a FN central cell binding (CCB) domain involved in FAK phosphorylation. When MMI270 (a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor) was added together with HGF, decreases in FN-CCB domain expression and FAK phosphorylation by HGF were restored, and these events were associated with an inhibition of HGF-induced apoptosis, suggesting that increased activities of MMPs underlie the major mechanism of HGF-mediated apoptosis in myofibroblasts. In bleomycin-treated mice, c-Met expression was found on interstitial myofibroblasts and HGF increased apoptosis in culture of myofibroblasts isolated from bleomycin-treated murine lungs. Furthermore, administration of recombinant HGF to bleomycin-treated mice increased lung MMP activities and enhanced myofibroblast apoptosis, while in vivo MMI270 injections together with HGF inhibited such MMP activation, leading to suppressed myofibroblast apoptosis. In conclusion, we identified HGF as a key ligand to elicit myofibroblast apoptosis and ECM degradation, whereas activation of the HGF/c-Met system in fibrotic lungs may be considered a target to attenuate progression of chronic lung disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2152406992,"Circadian pacemaker neurons contain a molecular clock that oscillates with a period of approximately 24 hr, controlling circadian rhythms of behavior. Pacemaker neurons respond to visual system inputs for clock resetting, but, unlike other neurons, have not been reported to transmit rapid signals to their targets. Here we show that pacemaker neurons are required to mediate a rapid behavior. The Drosophila larval visual system, Bolwig's organ (BO), projects to larval pacemaker neurons to entrain their clock. BO also mediates larval photophobic behavior. We found that ablation or electrical silencing of larval pacemaker neurons abolished light avoidance. Thus, circadian pacemaker neurons receive input from BO not only to reset the clock but also to transmit rapid photophobic signals. Furthermore, as clock gene mutations also affect photophobicity, the pacemaker neurons modulate the sensitivity of larvae to light, generating a circadian rhythm in visual sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2108376231,"Monastrol is a small, cell-permeable molecule that arrests cells in mitosis by specifically inhibiting Eg5, a member of the Kinesin-5 family. We have used steady-state and presteady-state kinetics as well as equilibrium binding approaches to define the mechanistic basis of S-monastrol inhibition of monomeric human Eg5/KSP. In the absence of microtubules (Mts), the basal ATPase activity is inhibited through slowed product release. In the presence of microtubules, the ATPase activity is also reduced with weakened binding of Eg5 to microtubules during steady-state ATP turnover. Monastrol-treated Eg5 also shows a decreased relative affinity for microtubules under equilibrium conditions. The Mt·Eg5 presteady-state kinetics of ATP binding and the subsequent ATP-dependent isomerization are unaffected during the first ATP turnover. However, monastrol appears to stabilize a conformation that allows for reversals at the ATP hydrolysis step. Monastrol promotes a dramatic decrease in the observed rate of Eg5 association with microtubules, and ADP release is slowed without trapping the Mt·Eg5·ADP intermediate. We propose that S-monastrol binding to Eg5 induces a stable conformational change in the motor domain that favors ATP re-synthesis after ATP hydrolysis. The aberrant interactions with the microtubule and the reversals at the ATP hydrolysis step alter the ability of Eg5 to generate force, thereby yielding a nonproductive Mt·Eg5 complex that cannot establish or maintain the bipolar spindle.

Sardana V. Xu B. Homnick C. Halczenko W. Buser C.A. Schaber M. Hartman G.D. Huber H.E. Kuo L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). How these conformational changes alter the ATPase mechanism of Eg5 and disturb force generation by the Mt·Eg5 complex is not well understood. Monastrol has been shown to inhibit ADP release in the absence and presence of microtubules (21.Maliga Z. Kapoor T.M. Mitchison T.J. Chem.

Also, a recent study using motility assays suggests that monastrol produces an Eg5 state that is weakly bound to the microtubule (33.Crevel I.M. Alonso M.C. Cross R.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R411-R412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this study, we utilized kinetic and thermodynamic approaches to define the molecular basis of Eg5 inhibition by S-monastrol, the more active enantiomer for inhibition (21.Maliga Z. Kapoor T.M.

Kapoor T.M. Mitchison T.J. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 22.DeBonis S. Simorre J.P. Crevel I. Lebeau L. Skoufias D.A. Blangy A.

Schaber M. Hartman G.D. Huber H.E. Kuo L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The ATPase mechanism of both monomeric Eg5 motors has been well characterized (34.Cochran J.C. Sontag C.A. Maliga Z. Kapoor T.M. Correia J.J. Gilbert S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38861-38870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which provides a foundation to better understand the molecular basis of S-monastrol effects on microtubule-based motility. The kinetics and equilibrium binding characteristics of Eg5S presented here reveal an aberrant ATPase cycle, whereby S-monastrol stabilizes a conformation of the Eg5 motor domain such that the Mt·Eg5S·ADP·Pi intermediate can re-synthesize ATP after the forward hydrolysis event. In addition, our data are consistent with the microtubule-binding ability of the motor being compromised by S-monastrol binding. Taken together, monastrol promotes an ineffective Mt·Eg5S complex that cannot generate the force required to establish and maintain the bipolar mitotic spindle for chromosome segregation. Experimental Conditions, S-Monastrol, and Me2SO Control—Experiments were performed at 25 °C in ATPase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2 with KOH, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% sucrose). Previous studies have indicated that the S-enantiomer of monastrol was more active than either its R counterpart or the racemic mixture (21.Maliga Z. Kapoor T.M. Mitchison T.J. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 22.DeBonis S. Simorre J.P. Crevel I. Lebeau L. Skoufias D.A. Blangy A. Ebel C. Gans P. Cross R. Hackney D.D.

Kuo L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We have confirmed these results (data not shown) and have used the S-enantiomer in all experiments presented here (a generous gift from Merck Research Laboratories). Our S-monastrol stock (100 mm) was prepared in Me2SO (analytical grade; Sigma-Aldrich Co.). For each experiment, a 1 mmS-monastrol stock was prepared by diluting the 100 mm stock to 1 mm in ATPase buffer (∼1% Me2SO). A Me2SO control stock was also prepared by dilution of the same volume of Me2SO in ATPase buffer. In all control experiments shown, the concentration of Me2SO was equivalent to the Me2SO concentration at the corresponding S-monastrol concentration. All concentrations reported for experiments were final after mixing. Protein Preparation—We have expressed and purified two human Eg5 motors (Eg5–367 and Eg5–437) as described previously (34.Cochran J.C. Sontag C.A. Maliga Z. Kapoor T.M. Correia J.J. Gilbert S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38861-38870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We determined the Eg5 protein concentration by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) with IgG as the protein standard. On the day of each experiment, an aliquot of purified bovine brain tubulin was thawed and cycled, and the microtubules were stabilized with 20 μm Taxol (paclitaxel, Sigma-Aldrich Co.). Steady-state ATPase Kinetics—The inhibition of Eg5 steady-state ATP turnover by S-monastrol was determined by monitoring [α-32P]ADP·Pi product formation in the absence and presence of microtubules (as described previously (35.Gilbert S.P. Mackey A.T. Methods. 2000; 22: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)). In the absence of microtubules, Eg5 was treated with varying concentrations of S-monastrol for 30 min and reacted with [α-32P]MgATP. In Fig. 1A, the inhibition of the rate of the basal ATPase activity was plotted as a function of S-monastrol concentration, and each data set was fit to the following quadratic equation, Rate=−0.5∗{(Ainh+Kd,S+S0)−[(Ainh+Kd,S+S0) 2−(4AinhS0)] 1/2}+kmax (Eq. 1) where the Rate is the amount of product formed per second per active site, Ainh is the amplitude of S-monastrol inhibition defined by kmax (kcat at no S-monastrol) minus kmin (kcat at saturating S-monastrol), Kd,S is the apparent dissociation constant for S-monastrol, and S0 is the S-monastrol concentration. In the presence of microtubules, Eg5 was treated with increasing concentrations of S-monastrol for 15 min, incubated with microtubules for 30 min, and then reacted with [α-32P]MgATP. Fig. 1B shows the steady-state rate of ATP turnover as a function of S-monastrol concentration, and each data set was fit to Equation 1. In Fig. 1 (C and D), the rate of ATP turnover at constant S-monastrol and [α-32P]MgATP concentrations was plotted as a function of microtubule concentration for each Eg5 motor, and the data were fit to the following quadratic equation, Rate=0.5∗kcat∗{(E0+K1/2,Mt+Mt0)−[(E0+K1/2,Mt+Mt0) 2−(4E0Mt0)] 1/2} (Eq. 2) where the Rate is the concentration of product formed per second per active site, kcat is the maximum rate constant of product formation at saturating substrate, E0 is the total Eg5 site concentration, K ½,Mt is the microtubule concentration needed to provide one-half the maximal velocity, and Mt0 is the microtubule concentration. In Fig. 1 (E and F), the rate of ATP turnover at constant S-monastrol and microtubule concentrations was plotted as a function of [α-32P]MgATP concentration for each Eg5 motor, and each data set was fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Mt·Eg5S Cosedimentation Assays—Equilibrium binding experiments were performed where Eg5 was treated with or without S-monastrol for 15 min, followed by incubation with increasing microtubule concentrations for 30 min either in the absence of additional nucleotide (Fig. 2, A and B) or in the presence of different nucleotides (Fig. 2C) (as described previously (34.Cochran J.C.

Gilbert S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35307-35318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). The Mt·Eg5 complexes were pelleted by centrifugation in a Beckman Airfuge (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA) at 30 p.s.i. (100,000 × g) for 30 min. Gel samples were prepared for the supernatant and pellet fractions at equal volumes for each microtubule concentration, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. In Fig. 2A, each data set was fit to the following quadratic equation, Mt·E/E0=0.5∗{(E0+Kd,Mt+Mt0)−[(E0+Kd,Mt+Mt0) 2−(4E0Mt0)] 1/2} (Eq. 3) where Mt·E/E0 is the fraction of Eg5 partitioning with the microtubule pellet, E0 is total Eg5 site concentration, Kd, Mt defines the upper limit for the equilibrium dissociation constant, and Mt0 is the microtubule concentration. Acid-quench Experiments—The kinetics of ATP hydrolysis for Eg5 in the presence of S-monastrol were defined through a series of acid-quench experiments using a chemical quench-flow instrument (Kintek Corp., Austin, TX) (Figs. 4 and 5). In all experiments, a preformed Mt·Eg5 complex (with or without S-monastrol) was rapidly mixed with [α-32P]MgATP (with or without S-monastrol) plus 100 mm KCl. The additional salt was added to the MgATP syringe to lower Eg5 steady-state ATPase activity without affecting the kinetics of the first ATP turnover (Fig. 4F). The reaction continued for various times (from 5 ms to 1 s), was quenched with formic acid, and radiolabeled product formation was quantified (as described previously (35.Gilbert S.P. Mackey A.T. Methods. 2000; 22: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)). The concentration of [α-32P]ADP was plotted as a function of time, and the data were fit to the following burst equation, Product=A0∗[1−exp(−kbt)]+ksst (Eq. 4) where A0 is the amplitude of the presteady-state burst phase that corresponds to accumulation of product at the Eg5 active site during the first turnover; kb is the rate constant of the exponential burst phase; t is time in seconds; and kss is the rate constant of the linear phase (μm ADP·s–1) defining steady-state turnover. In Fig. 4 (B and D), the exponential burst rate (kb) and burst amplitude (A0) were plotted as a function of S-monastrol and MgATP concentration, respectively, and each data set was fit to a hyperbola.Fig. 5Acid-quench experiments to evaluate sequential addition of S-monastrol.A, the time course of product formation under three different experimental conditions. Experiment 1 (Expt. 1): Mt·Eg5 complex was reacted with MgATP (▪). Expt. 2: Mt·Eg5 complex was reacted with MgATP plus S-monastrol (□). Expt. 3: Mt·Eg5 complex plus S-monastrol was reacted with MgATP (♦). Final concentrations: 5 μm Eg5–437, 6 μm tubulin, 20 μm Taxol, 100 μmS-monastrol, 200 μm MgATP, and 100 mm KCl. The data for each experiment were fit to Equation 4. B, the exponential burst rate, burst amplitude, and the rate constant of the linear phase defining steady-state turnover were plotted for each experimental setup. Error bars represent the standard error in the fit of the data. C, the data from panels A and B were modeled to Equations 4, 5, 6, 7 to define the ATP hydrolysis constants k+2, k–2 and kslow (Scheme 1 and Table I).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Modeling of Burst Kinetics—For a kinetic pathway, including a reversible chemical reaction (Scheme 1), the time dependence of product formation follows Equation 4 where the rates and amplitude are defined by the following equations (37.Johnson K.A. in.The Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-61Crossref Scopus (379) Google Scholar), kb=k+2+k−2+kslow (Eq. 5) A0=E0∗[k+2(k+2+k−2)/(k+2+k−2+kslow) 2] (Eq. 6) kss=E0∗[k+2kslow/(k+2+k−2+kslow)] (Eq. 7) where k+2 is the exponential rate constant for ATP hydrolysis, k–2 is the rate constant for the reverse hydrolysis reaction (ATP re-synthesis), kslow is the rate of the slow step in the pathway that occurs after ATP hydrolysis, and E0 is the Eg5 site concentration. In Fig. 5C, the data from Fig. 5A were modeled to Equations 4, 5, 6, 7 to define the ATP hydrolysis constants k+2, k–2, and kslow (Scheme 1). The following assumptions were made in the modeling: 1) for Experiment 3, the Eg5 site concentration that represents the Mt·Eg5 complex was approximated using data from cosedimentation experiments (Fig. 2) performed under similar experimental conditions, and 2) the rate constant k–2 was extremely slow in the absence of S-monastrol and was assigned 0.001 s–1. The rate constants, k+2, k–2, and kslow, were all allowed to float in the analysis. Stopped-flow Experiments—To investigate the effect of S-monastrol on mantATP binding, Eg5S association with Mts, and mantADP release, several stopped-flow experiments were performed using a SF-2003 Kintek stopped-flow instrument (Kintek Corp.). For racemic mantATP or -ADP experiments, fluorescence emission at 450 nm was measured using a 400-nm cutoff filter with excitation at 360 nm (mercury arc lamp). In Fig. 3B, the mantATP binding data in the absence or presence of S-monastrol were fit to the following hyperbola, kobs={(kmax∗[mantATP])/(K1/2,mantATP+[mantATP])}+koff (Eq. 8) where kobs is the exponential rate constant obtained from the fluorescence enhancement, kmax is the maximum rate of mantATP binding, K½,mantATP is the concentration of mantATP required to provide half kmax, and koff is the observed rate of mantATP dissociation obtained from the y-intercept. The mantATP binding data at low mantATP concentrations (Fig. 3B, inset) were fit to the following linear function, kobs=k+1∗[mantATP]+koff where k+1 is the second-order rate constant for mantATP binding, and koff represents mantATP dissociation from the active site. The kinetics of Eg5S association with Mts (Fig. 6) was determined by monitoring the change in solution turbidity at 340 nm using a stopped-flow instrument. The observed rate constant of Eg5S association with Mts was plotted as a function of S-monastrol concentration (Fig. 6, B and C), and the data were fit to the following quadratic equation, kobs=−0.5∗{(Ainh+Kd,S+S0)−[(Ainh+Kd,S+S0) 2−(4AinhS0)] 1/2}+kmax (Eq. 10) where kobs is the observed exponential rate obtained from the change in turbidity, Ainh defines the amplitude of S-monastrol inhibition equal to kmax (kobs with no S-monastrol) minus kmin (kobs at saturating S-monastrol), Kd,S is the apparent dissociation constant for S-monastrol, and S0 is the S-monastrol concentration. mantADP release from the Mt·Eg5S·mantADP complex was determined by preincubating Eg5 with mantADP at a 1:2 ratio (Eg5:mantADP) to exchange ADP for mantADP at the nucleotide pocket, followed by treatment with increasing concentrations of S-monastrol for 15 min. This reaction mixture was then rapidly mixed with microtubules plus MgATP (to effectively prevent mantADP re-binding), and the fluorescence emission at 450 nm was monitored (Fig. 7). The observed rate and amplitude of mantADP release obtained from the fluorescence reduction were plotted as a function of S-monastrol concentration, and each data set was fit to Equation 10. Phosphocreatine Kinase-coupled Assays—The experiments presented in Fig. 8 were performed (as described before (34.Cochran J.C. Sontag C.A. Maliga Z. Kapoor T.M. Correia J.J. Gilbert S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38861-38870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 35.Gilbert S.P. Mackey A.T. Methods. 2000; 22: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) to determine the rate of ADP release from the Eg5S·ADP complex and to characterize the equilibrium state of the Mt·Eg5S·ADP complex. Briefly, Eg5·ADP was incubated with trace amounts of [α-32]ATP for 90 min to convert all radiolabeled ATP to ADP (data not shown). The Eg5·[α-32]ADP complex was treated with S-monastrol for 30 min, followed by mixing with 2.5 mm unlabeled MgATP plus a creatine kinase/phosphocreatine ATP regeneration system (with or without Mts) to transfer Pi to the [α-32]ADP free in solution. The experimental design assumes that ADP at the Eg5 active site is inaccessible to the creatine kinase and therefore is protected from enzymatic conversion to ATP. The tightly bound [α-32]ADP concentration was quantified as a function of time, and each data set was fit to the following exponential equation, [ADP]=A∗ exp(−kofft)+C (Eq. 11) where the total Eg5 sites with ADP tightly bound [Eg5·ADP] is the sum of the amplitude (A) and the constant term (C) to extrapolate to zero time (t). The term koff is the first-order rate constant for ADP release. Monastrol Inhibits Steady-state ATPase with or without Microtubules—We began our mechanistic study of S-monastrol inhibition of two monomeric Eg5 motors (Eg5–367 and Eg5–437) by characterizing the ATPase activity of Eg5S in the presence and absence of microtubules. In the absence of microtubules, the rate of ATP turnover decreased as a function of S-monastrol concentration (Eg5–367: 0.02 s–1 to 0.001 s–1; Eg5–437: 0.001 s–1 to 0.0005 s–1), and the apparent Kd,S was ∼2 μm for each motor (Fig. 1A and Table I). These results confirm that monastrol inhibits the basal ATPase activity of Eg5–367 and Eg5–437 as reported previously (21.Maliga Z. Kapoor T.M. Mitchison T.J. Chem.

https://openalex.org/W2149390328,"The vascular endothelium is richly endowed with caveolae, which are specialized membrane microdomains that facilitate the integration of specific cellular signal transduction processes. We found that the large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels are associated with caveolin-1 in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs). OptiPrep gradient cell fractionation demonstrated that BK channels were concentrated in the caveolae-rich fraction in BAECs. Immunofluorescence imaging showed co-localization of caveolin-1 and BK channels in the BAEC membrane. Immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay results indicated that caveolin-1 and BK channels are physically associated. However, whole cell patch clamp recordings could not detect BK (iberiotoxin-sensitive) currents in cultured BAECs under baseline conditions, even though the presence of BK mRNA and protein expression was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blots. Cholesterol depletion redistributed the BK channels to non-caveolar fractions of BAECs, resulting in BK channel activation (7.3 ± 1.6 pA/picofarad (pF), n = 5). BK currents were also activated by isoproterenol (ISO, 1 μm, 6.9 ± 2.4 pA/pF, n = 6). Inclusion of a caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide (10 μm) in the pipette solution completely abrogated the effects of ISO on BK channel activation, whereas inclusion of the scrambled control peptide (10 μm) did not inhibit the ISO effects. We have also found that caveolin-1 knockdown by small interference RNA activated BK currents (5.3 ± 1.4 pA/pF, n = 6). We conclude that: 1) BK channels are targeted to caveolae microdomains in vascular endothelial cells; 2) caveolin-1 interacts with BK channels and exerts a negative regulatory effect on channel functions; and 3) BK channels are inactive under control conditions but can be activated by cholesterol depletion, knockdown of caveolin-1 expression, or ISO stimulation.

In vascular endothelium, caveolae regulate nitric oxide (NO) 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; BK channel, large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell; CD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IBTX, iberiotoxin; ISO, isoproterenol; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; AP, antennapedia; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pF, picofarads; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase; hSlo, human BK channel α-subunit; hSlo-V5, hSlo with a C-terminal V5 epitope tag.1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; BK channel, large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cell; CD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IBTX, iberiotoxin; ISO, isoproterenol; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; AP, antennapedia; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pF, picofarads; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase; hSlo, human BK channel α-subunit; hSlo-V5, hSlo with a C-terminal V5 epitope tag. homeostasis and critically control Ca2+ signaling through the microdomain targeting of Ca2+ influx channels and pumps (5Minshall R.D.

It is now clear that caveolae and its signature protein, caveolin, provide platforms for integrating specific cellular signal transduction processes by harboring important components of cellular signaling cascades, including G proteins, kinases, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, hormone receptors, neurotransmitters, and growth factors (6Razani B.

These animals are viable and fertile but exhibit severe pulmonary and vascular abnormalities. In addition, their systemic NO levels are dramatically elevated, and they develop pulmonary hypertension and cardiomyopathy. These findings confirm the regulatory role of caveolae on NO signaling and vascular homeostasis. The Ca2+-activated K+ channels are important ion channels, linking the metabolic state and cellular Ca2+ homeostasis with cellular excitability. All three types of Ca2+-activated K+ channels, the small conductance, intermediate conductance, and large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels have been found in endothelial cells (12Sage S.O. Marchenko S.M. Archer S.L. Rusch N.J. Potassium Channels in Cardiovascular Biology. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2001: 651-666Crossref Google Scholar, 13Nilius B. Viana F. Droogmans G.

Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2001: 639-650Crossref Google Scholar). The most important and commonly observed Ca2+-activated K+ channels in blood vessels are BK channels, which are ubiquitous and present in virtually all tissues except in myocardium (15Nelson M.T. Quayle J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C799-C822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Vergara C. Latorre R. Marrion N.V. Adelman J.P. Curr. Opin.

However, whether these channels exist in vascular endothelial cells is still controversial (18Gauthier K.M. Liu C. Popovic A. Albarwani S. Rusch N.J. J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). BK channels were first reported in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) (19Fichtner H. Frobe U. Busse R. Kohlhardt M. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 98: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and a later report confirmed their presence in a similar preparation (20Ling B.N. O'Neill W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: H1827-H1838PubMed Google Scholar). BK channels are also present in primary cultured pig coronary artery endothelial cells (21Baron A. Frieden M. Beny J.L. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22Baron A. Frieden M. Chabaud F. Beny J.L. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Beny J.L.

In addition, BK channels have been observed in freshly isolated rabbit aortic endothelial cells (26Rusko J. Tanzi F. van Breemen C. Adams D.J. J. Physiol. 1992; 455: 601-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) but not in freshly isolated bovine coronary endothelial cells (18Gauthier K.M. Liu C. Popovic A. Albarwani S. Rusch N.J. J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The activity of BK channels in vascular endothelial cells could control K+ efflux, membrane potential, and affect intracellular Ca2+ concentration (27Kamouchi M. Trouet D. De Greef C. Droogmans G. Eggermont J. Nilius B. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but how the endothelial BK channels are regulated is unknown. In this study, we provide compelling evidence that BK channels are targeted to caveolae in BAECs. Such membrane microdomain targeting involves the interaction between BK channels and caveolin-1, resulting in a negative regulatory effect on BK channel functions. These results suggest a possible new mechanism of ion channel regulation and help to provide new insights in the regulation of endothelial cell function. Materials—The following antibodies were used: custom-made polyclonal anti-BK α-subunit antibody raised in rabbits against a peptide (KTKEAQKINNGSSQADGTLKPVDE) of the bovine BK α-subunit (NCBI accession number AAK54354), polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), monoclonal anti-clathrin (BD Transduction Laboratories), monoclonal anti-Golgi 58 (Sigma), monoclonal anti-V5 (Invitrogen), and monoclonal anti-actin antibodies (Oncogene Research, San Diego, CA). Cavtratin (28Gratton J.P. Lin M.I. Yu J. Weiss E.D. Jiang Z.L. Fairchild T.A. Iwakiri Y. Groszmann R. Claffey K.P. Cheng Y.C. Sessa W.C. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 31-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), a peptide containing the putative scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 (amino acids 82–101, DGIWKASFTTFTVTKYWFYR), and AP-Cav-X, the scrambled control peptide (WGIDKAFFTTSTVTYKWFRY), were synthesized as fusion peptides to the C terminus of the antennapedia (AP) internalization sequence (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK), purified, and analyzed by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry by the Expression Proteomics and Protein Chemistry Facility at the Mayo Clinic. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD), filipin, and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless mentioned otherwise. All tissue culture reagents, including M199 medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin, were obtained from Invitrogen. Cell Culture and Transfection—BAECs and HEK293T cells were used in these studies. BAECs were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and used between passages 2 and 5 in this study. BAECs were cultured in M199 and HEK293T cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine (1 mm), penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). HEK293T cells were plated onto 60-mm culture dishes and transfected at 60% confluence with pcDNA6 plasmids containing the human BK channel α-subunit (hSlo) that has a C-terminal V5 epitope tag (hSlo-V5), a kind gift from Dr. Jon Lippiat (University of Oxford, UK). We have confirmed that this construct could express functional BK channels in HEK293T cells with properties similar to the wild-type channel. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Fortyeight hours after transfection, BK channel expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-V5 antibody. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA from BAECs was isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and treated with DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX). RNAs were reverse-transcribed using the ThermoScript RT-PCR System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was amplified using primers specific to the C terminus of bovine BK α-subunit (GenBank™ accession number NM_174680): left primer: 5′-GCGTTATCCTGTCAGCCAAT-3′ and right primer: 5′-GGCGTAACATCCCATGTACC-3′. Samples were incubated for 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Amplified cDNA products were separated on a 3% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. A 1-kb Plus DNA ladder (Invitrogen) served as the molecular size reference. The negative controls included amplifications performed using the above primers in the absence of BAECs cDNA template, and amplifications using no RT control (total RNA) to exclude the possibility of contaminations from genomic DNA. Preparation of Caveolin-rich Membrane Fractions and Immunoprecipitation—To prepare the caveolae-rich fractions, 50 × 106 BAECs were harvested, homogenized in cold buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8), layered onto 30% Percoll, and centrifuged at 84,000 × g for 30 min (29Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 30Peterson T.E. Poppa V. Ueba H. Wu A. Yan C. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane fraction was collected and brought to a volume of 2 ml with buffer A. The crude membrane fraction was then sonicated three times for 5 s each, resuspended in a 23% solution of OptiPrep, and then placed in a centrifuge tube. A linear 20% to 10% OptiPrep gradient was layered on top and centrifuged at 52,000 × g for 90 min. Eight fractions (1.5 ml each, the lightest in fraction 1 and the heaviest in fraction 8) were collected for further analysis. Cholesterol depletion of BAECs was achieved by incubation with 10 mm of the cholesterol binding drug, CD, in serum-free medium for 1 h, and the cells were fractionated by density gradient centrifugation as in control cells. Immunoprecipitation of caveolin-associated proteins was performed as previously described with modifications (31Martens J.R. Sakamoto N. Sullivan S.A. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8409-8414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Briefly, the caveolae-enriched fraction (fraction 2) of the density gradient was diluted with lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (1.04 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 15 μm pepstatin A, 14 μm E-64, 40 μm bestatin, 20 μm leupeptin, and 0.8 μm aprotinin), and precleared by incubation for 2 h with protein-G-agarose beads (30 μl). Precleared supernatants were incubated with 2 μg of polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody at 4 °C overnight with gentle mixing, followed by the addition of 25 μl of recombinant protein-G-agarose and continued incubation for another 2 h. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min, washed two times with 0.7 ml of buffer 1 (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.6) and two times with buffer 2 (20 mm HEPES, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.2). The complexes were solubilized in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, resolved in SDS-PAGE, and blotted against anti-BK and monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibodies. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated by 4–15% SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked for 2 h with 10% milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by incubation with either anti-BK (1: 300), -caveolin-1 (1:1000), -clathrin (1:1000), or -Golgi (1:5000) antibodies, overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washes with 0.1% PBS-Tween, the primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and the signals were developed by Immun-Star HRP Chemiluminescent Kit (Bio-Rad). Purification of Recombinant GST-Caveolin-1 Fusion Protein and in Vitro Binding Assays with hSlo-V5—A cDNA construct encoding the full-length glutathione S-transferase (GST)-caveolin-1 fusion protein was created by subcloning the human caveolin-1 cDNA (in pcDNA3) into the GST fusion protein vector, pGEX-4T-2 as previously described (32Cao S. Yao J. McCabe T.J. Yao Q. Katusic Z.S. Sessa W.C. Shah V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14249-14256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). GST-caveolin-1 and GST constructs were transformed into BL21 (DE3), induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) for 3 h, and lysed by sonication with lysozyme (200 μg/ml) in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were resonicated after the addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (11,700 × g), and the supernatant was mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads (20-μl slurry) and agitated for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 500 rpm, and the pellets were washed three times in PBS with 1% Triton X-100. The specificity and quality of GST-caveolin-1 were assessed by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels. For the pull-down assay, GST-caveolin-1 fusion proteins (50 μg) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with lysates (1 mg/each) of HEK293T cells transfected with or without hSlo-V5. Alternatively, GST (30 μg) alone was incubated with the cell lysates in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5. Bound proteins were washed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.7), 250 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, eluted with Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The presence of recombinant BK channels pulled down by the GST-caveolin-1 fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted against anti-V5 antibodies. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—BAECs were plated onto Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL), fixed with ice-cold methanol (100%) for 15 min, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min. After incubation with 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min, cells were incubated with a monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody (1:200 dilution) plus a polyclonal anti-BK α-subunit antibody (1:100 dilution). The controls were incubated with normal goat serum or pre-immune rabbit serum for 1 h. The primary antibodies were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) or with Texas Red-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500 dilution) and mounted in Prolong Anti-fade Reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Samples were washed with PBS after both the primary and the secondary antibody incubations. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258. Cells were visualized using a confocal laser microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss, Germany) with a 100× oil immersion lens. Caveolin-1 Knockdown by Small Interfering RNA—A caveolin-1 siRNA duplex corresponding to bovine caveolin-1 mRNA targeting against the open reading frame, 223–241 bases (5′-CCA GAA GGA ACA CAC AGU U-dTdT-3′) and a negative control siRNA (5′-GCG CGC UUU GUA GGA UUC G-dTdT-3′) were selected for caveolin-1 knockdown (33Gonzalez E. Nagiel A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40659-40669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). siRNA duplex oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). BAECs at 70% confluence were used for the transfection of siRNA. Different concentrations (20, 30, and 60 nm) of siRNAs were tested in the transfections using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Fresh medium was added 5 h after transfection, and the cells were analyzed 48 h after transfection. Electrophysiology Studies—Whole cell current recordings were performed as previously described (34Lee H.C. Lu T. Weintraub N.L. VanRollins M. Spector A.A. Shibata E.F. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 153-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). BAECs seeded on coverslips were placed in a 1-ml chamber on the stage of an inverted microscope. The averaged cellular capacitance of BAECs was 11.9 ± 0.6 pF (n = 28). Bath solution (in mm: NaCl 145, KCl 4.0, MgCl2 1.0, CaCl2 1.0, HEPES 10, glucose 10, pH 7.4) was superfused through the chamber at 1–2 ml/min. Borosilicate glass capillary patch pipettes (Corning 7056, Warner Instrument, Grand Hamden, CT) were fire-polished. The electrode resistance when filled with the pipette solution (in mm: KCl 140, MgCl2 0.5, Na2ATP 5.0, Na2GTP 0.5, HEPES 10, EGTA 1.0, pH 7.2, and CaCl2 was added to provide 1.0 μm free Ca2+, as calculated using Chelator software) was usually 1–5 MΩ, and the typical seal resistance was >10 GΩ. Whole cell BK currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B integrating amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and the output of the amplifier was filtered through an 8-pole low pass Bessel filter at 1 or 5 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz (12-bit resolution, Digidata 1200, Axon). Subsequently, the data were acquired using pClamp 8.0 software (Axon) with a personal computer for further offline analysis. The effect of drugs on BK currents was measured by eliciting K+ currents in the presence of 1 μm cytoplasmic free Ca2+, from a holding potential of -60 mV to a testing potential of +80 mV for 400 ms, and repeated at 10-s intervals. Current-voltage relationships were recorded with a holding potential of -60 mV and testing potentials from -60 mV to +150 mV for 60 ms, in 10-mV increments. BK currents were isolated by digital subtraction as the iberiotoxin (IBTX)-sensitive currents (100 nm). Whole cell currents were normalized to cell capacitance and expressed as pA/pF. All experiments were performed at room temperature (21–23 °C). Statistical Analysis—Data were presented as mean ± S.E. Paired Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance with repeated measures were used to compare data obtained before and after intervention. Pair-wise comparisons among the groups were performed using a posthoc Tukey test. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. BK Channels Are Present in BAECs—Because the existence of BK channels in vascular endothelial cells is controversial (18Gauthier K.M. Liu C. Popovic A. Albarwani S. Rusch N.J. J.

Physiol. 2000; 524: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we first sought to determine whether BK channels are present in BAECs by measuring BK channel mRNA in these cells. Total RNA was isolated from BAECs and treated with DNase I. The cDNAs obtained by RT were amplified using primers specific to a C-terminal sequence of the bovine BK α-subunit as described under “Experimental Procedures.” No template and no RT negative controls were used to rule out possible reagent and genomic DNA contamination. Expression of BK channel mRNA in BAECs was confirmed as shown in Fig. 1A. To determine whether BK channel protein is expressed in BAECs, we used a rabbit polyclonal anti-BK α-subunit antibody that we developed against the peptide KTKEAQKINNGSSQADGTLKPVDE. This sequence shares a 100% identity with the human, rat, and bovine BK channel α-subunit sequences. The specificity of the antibody was verified by immunoblotting with rat coronary artery lysates showing a single band at about 130 kDa (Fig. 1B), and incubation of the antibody with the above peptide would completely block the binding of the antibody to the BK bands (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Fig. 1C shows the Western blot analysis of BK channel expression in BAEC lysates. The results demonstrated that the BK α-subunit is present in BAECs. To further determine that functional BK channels are present in BAECs, we performed whole cell patch clamp recordings in BAECs. Under baseline conditions, there were no discernible BK (IBTX-sensitive) currents in cultured BAECs (Fig. 1D, left panel). This is consistent with the previous observation that BK channel densities were very low in cultured endothelial cells under baseline conditions and were observed in 4% of the patches (19Fichtner H. Frobe U. Busse R. Kohlhardt M. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 98: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, BK currents in BAECs could be activated by 1 μm isoproterenol (ISO) (Fig. 1D, right panel). At a holding potential of -60 mV and a testing potential of +100 mV, whole cell K+ currents increased from a baseline of 8.7 ± 1.7 pA/pF to 21.7 ± 5.4 pA/pF with ISO (n = 6, p = 0.03 versus baseline), and reduced to 14.6 ± 3.4 pA/pF with ISO plus 100 nm IBTX (n = 6, p = 0.04 versus ISO), suggesting that more than half of the ISO effects was from BK channel activation. Fig. 1D shows the I-V relationships of whole cell K+ currents at baseline, with 1 μm ISO, and with 1 μm ISO plus 100 nm IBTX. These results suggested that BK channels are expressed and detectable at the mRNA, protein, and functional levels in BAECs. It is interesting that these channels are inactive under baseline static culture conditions but could be activated upon stimulation of the β-adrenergic receptor. BK Channels Are Targeted to Caveolae in BAECs—Caveolae-rich membrane fractions were prepared using a detergent-free sucrose density gradient method as previously described (29Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 30Peterson T.E. Poppa V. Ueba H. Wu A. Yan C. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were separated into eight 1.5-ml fractions (numbered 1 through 8, with sample 1 being the lightest (top) fraction). Immunoblot analysis of the fractions against anti-BK α-subunit antibody (Fig. 2A, upper panel) and anti-caveolin-1 antibody (Fig. 2A, lower panel) demonstrated that BK channels were present in the caveolae-rich fraction (fraction 2). BK channels were also observed in a heavier fraction (fraction 6), which contained Golgi and clathrin-associated membranes as indicated in Fig. 2B. These results suggested that BK channels are targeted to the"

Consequently, substantial amounts of insulin protein were induced by such combination. Furthermore, in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, MafA overexpression in the liver, together with PDX-1 and NeuroD, dramatically ameliorated glucose tolerance, while combination of PDX-1 and NeuroD was much less effective.

It is known that the insulin gene is specifically expressed in pancreatic β-cells and that insulin plays a crucial role in maintaining blood glucose levels. It was previously shown that an unidentified β-cell-specific nuclear factor binds to a conserved cis-regulatory element called RIPE3b in the insulin gene promoter region and is likely to function as an important transactivator for the insulin gene (1Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sharma A. Fusco-DeMane D. Henderson E. Efrat S. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1468-1488PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, this important transactivator for the insulin gene was identified as MafA, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor (3Matsuoka T.A. Zhao L. Artner I. Jarrett H.W. Friedman D. Means A.

MafA controls β-cell-specific expression of the insulin gene through a cis-regulatory element called RIPE3b and functions as a potent transactivator for the insulin gene (3Matsuoka T.A. Zhao L.

During pancreas development, MafA expression is first detected at the beginning of the principal phase of insulin-producing cell production (4Matsuoka T.A. Artner I. Henderson E. Means A. Sander M.

In addition, while both PDX-1 and NeuroD are expressed in various types of cells in islets, MafA is the only β-cell-specific transactivator for the insulin gene. Thus, the potency of MafA as an insulin gene activator, together with its unique expression in β-cells, raises the likelihood that MafA is a principal factor of β-cell formation and function. Insulin plays a crucial role in maintaining blood glucose levels, but in the diabetic state, chronic hyperglycemia decreases insulin gene expression and secretion. MafA DNA binding activity is also reduced under diabetic conditions in parallel with the decrease of insulin gene expression (2Sharma A. Fusco-DeMane D. Henderson E. Efrat S. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1468-1488PubMed Google Scholar, 14Poitout V. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1041-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Moran A. Zhang H.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 42351-42354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Although normoglycemia can be efficiently restored by pancreas and islet transplantation, such treatment requires life-long immunosuppressive therapy and is limited by tissue supply (17Robertson R.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 694-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 18Weir G.C. Bonner-Weir S. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, in exploring new therapeutic methods to replace the reduced insulin in diabetes and to maintain normal glucose tolerance, it is very important to search for ways to enhance insulin gene transcription and to induce insulin-producing cells. In this study, we show that MafA expression in the liver, together with PDX-1 and NeuroD, markedly induces insulin gene transcription and dramatically ameliorates glucose tolerance in diabetic model animals. These results suggest a crucial role of MafA as a novel therapeutic target for diabetes and imply that such combination should be useful for replacing the reduced β-cell function found in diabetes. Gene Transfection and Luciferase Assays—HepG2 cells were grown in Earle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The insulin 2 promoter-reporter plasmid (1.0 μg) containing 238-bp 5′-flanking sequences of the rat insulin 2 promoter region (1Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Robinson G.L.W.G. Peshavaria M. Henderson E. Shieh S-Y. Tsai M.-J. Teitelman G. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2452-2460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 0.5 μg of the pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega) were co-transfected with 1.0 μg of the MafA, PDX-1, and/or NeuroD expression plasmids (or the empty vectors) using the Lipofectamine reagent (Life Technologies). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. Preparations of cellular extracts were assayed using a luciferase assay system (Promega). For the luciferase assay, light emission was measured with a Monolight 3010 Luminometer (Pharmingen), and β-galactosidase assays were performed with the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). The luciferase results were normalized with respect to transfection efficiency assessed from the results of the β-galactosidase assays. Preparation of Recombinant Adenoviruses Expressing MafA, PDX-1, and NeuroD (Ad-MafA, Ad-PDX-1, and Ad-NeuroD)—Recombinant adenoviruses expressing MafA, PDX-1, and NeuroD were prepared using the AdEasy system (kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center) (20He T.-C. Zhou S. DaCosta L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar). In brief, the encoding region of MafA, PDX-1, and NeuroD was cloned into a shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV. To produce homologous recombination, 1.0 μg of linearized plasmid containing MafA, PDX-1, and NeuroD and 0.1 μg of the adenoviral backbone plasmid, pAdEasy-1, were introduced into electrocompetent Escherichia coli BJ5183 cells by electroporation (2,500 V, 200 ohms, 25 microfarads). The resultant plasmids were then re-transformed into E. coli XL-Gold Ultracompetent Cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The plasmids were linearized with PacI and then transfected into the adenovirus packaging cell line 293 using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Ten days after transfection, the cell lysate was collected from the 293 cells. The cell lysate was added to fresh 293 cells and when most of the cells were killed by the adenovirus infection and detached, the cell lysate was obtained again (this process was repeated three times). The control adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) was prepared in the same manner. The adenovirus titers were further increased up to 1 × 1010 plaque forming units (pfu)/ml using the Adeno-X™ virus purification kit (Clontech). The virus titers were estimated using the Adeno-X™ titer kit (Clontech). Induction of Hyperglycemia by Streptozotocin (STZ) and Treatment with Recombinant Adenovirus—C57BL6 male mice (8 weeks old) (Japan SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan) were made diabetic by intraperitoneal injection of STZ (220 mg/kg) (Sigma), freshly dissolved in citrate buffer (pH 4.5). One week after STZ injection, mice were injected with 100 μl of Ad-MafA, Ad-PDX-1, Ad-NeuroD, or Ad-GFP (1 × 1010 pfu/ml) into the cervical vein. It is noted that the adenovirus injected from the cervical vein is known to be trapped only in the liver after its systematic circulation. After adenovirus injection, nonfasting blood glucose levels were measured regularly with a portable glucose meter (Precision QID, Medisense Inc., St. Charles, MA) after tail snipping. For measurement of plasma insulin levels, nonfasting blood samples were collected into heparinized capillary tubes, and plasma insulin levels were determined using an insulin-EIA test kit (Glazyme). Glucose Tolerance Tests—After overnight fast, mice were injected intraperitoneally with glucose (2.0 g/kg of body weight). Blood samples were taken at various time points (0–120 min), and blood glucose levels were determined as described above. Northern Blot Analysis—Ten micrograms of total RNA isolated from freeze-clamped liver tissues were electrophoresed on 1.0% formaldehyde-denatured agarose gel in 1 × MOPS running buffer and then transferred overnight to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The insulin probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime labeling system kit (Amersham Biosceinces). After overnight hybridization with a 32P-labled probe at 42 °C, the membranes were washed in 2 x saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. Kodak XAR film was exposed with an intensifying screen at –80 °C. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen). After quantification by spectrophotometry, 2.5 μg of RNA was heated at 85 °C for 3 min and then reverse-transcribed into cDNA in a 25-μl solution containing 200 units of Superscript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 50 ng of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 160 μm dNTP, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction consisted of 10 min at 25 °C, 60 min at 42 °C, and 10 min at 95 °C. Polymerization reactions were performed with a Perkin-Elmer 9700 Thermocycler using a 50-μl reaction volume containing 3 μl of cDNA (20 ng of RNA equivalents), 5 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 160 μm cold dNTPs, and 10 pmol of the appropriate oligonucleotide primers. The oligonucleotide primers were as follows: insulin 1 (370 bp), GAC CAG CTA TAA TCA GAG ACC (forward) and AGT TGC AGT AGT TCT CCA GCT G (reverse); insulin 2 (388 bp), AGC CCT AAG TGA TCC GCT ACA A (forward) and AGTTGCAGTAGTTCTCCAGCTG (reverse); glucokinase (islet type) (208 bp), TGG ATG ACA GAG CCA GGA TGG (forward) and ACT TCT GAG CCT TCT GGG GTG (reverse); SUR-1 (267 bp), CCA GAC CAA GGG AAG ATT CA (forward) and GTC CTG TAG GAT GAT GGA CA (reverse); Kir6.2 (218 bp), CCT GAG GAA TAT GTG CTG AC (forward) and CAC AGG AAG GAC ATG GTG AA (reverse); glucagon (205 bp), ACA GAG GAG AAC CCC AGA TC (forward) and CAT CAT GAC GTT TGG CAA TG (reverse); somatostatin (226 bp), AGT TTC TGC AGA AGT CTC TGG (forward) and AAG TTC TTG CAG CCA GCT TTG (reverse); pancreatic polypeptide (194 bp), ACA GGA TGG CCG TCG CAT ACT (forward) and GGC CTG GTC AGT GTG TTG ATG (reverse). The thermal cycle profile employed a 10-min denaturing step at 94 °C followed by 32 cycles (1 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min of annealing at 55 °C, and 1 min of extension at 72 °C) and an extension step of 10 min at 72 °C. The products were then separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Measurement of Insulin Content and Plasma Insulin Levels—For measurement of insulin content, the liver was excised, and insulin content in the tissue was determined using an insulin-EIA test kit (Glazyme) with mouse insulin as the standard. The data were normalized with respect to protein concentration in the extract, which was measured using a protein assay (Bio-Rad). For measurement of plasma insulin levels, blood samples were collected into heparinized capillary tubes, and plasma insulin levels were determined using an insulin-EIA test kit (Glazyme). Immunohistochemical Analyses—The mice were anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital. After a midline abdominal incision, pancreata were removed from the mice and fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS buffer. Fixed tissues were routinely processed for paraffin embedding and ∼4-μm sections were prepared and mounted on slides. Before incubation with antibodies, the mounted sections were rinsed with PBS three times. For detection of MafA, PDX-1, and NeuroD, the avidin-biotin complex (ABC) method was performed using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After treatment with target retrieval solution (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) at 90 °C for 5 min, the mounted sections were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-MafA antibody, rabbit anti-PDX-1 antiserum (21Watada H. Kajimoto Y. Umayahara Y. Matsuoka T. Kaneto H. Fujitani Y. Kamada T. Kawamori R. Yamasaki Y. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1478-1488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and goat anti-NeuroD antibody (N-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. This was followed by 1 h incubation with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (for MafA and PDX-1) or anti-goat IgG (for NeuroD) (Vector Laboratories) diluted 1:200. The sections were then incubated with ABC reagent for 1 h and positive reactions were visualized by incubation with the peroxidase substrate solution containing 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). For detection of insulin, the mounted sections were incubated overnight with guinea pig polyclonal anti-insulin antibody (Dako) diluted 1:1,000 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. This was also followed by 1-h incubation with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:200. The sections were then incubated with ABC reagent for 1 h, and positive reactions were visualized by incubation with the peroxidase substrate solution containing 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. MafA Expression in the Liver, together with PDX-1 and NeuroD, Markedly Induces Insulin Gene Expression—To evaluate the effect of MafA, PDX-1, and NeuroD expression on insulin gene transcription in the liver, we examined insulin gene promoter activity in HepG2 cells after transfection of each expression plasmid. As shown in Fig. 1A, basal insulin promoter activity was increased by MafA alone (∼80-fold increase), which was much more significant after overexpression of PDX-1 or NeuroD alone (∼5-fold increase). As shown in Fig. 1B, insulin promoter activity was further increased by MafA in the presence of PDX-1 or NeuroD (∼300- and ∼400-fold increase, respectively). Furthermore, MafA, together with PDX-1 plus NeuroD, drastically increased insulin promoter activity (∼1,200-fold increase). These results clearly show that MafA, PDX-1, and NeuroD exert strong synergistic effect on insulin promoter activity. Next, to evaluate the effect of ectopic expression of MafA, PDX-1, and NeuroD in the liver, we prepared MafA-, PDX-1-, and NeuroD-expressing adenoviruses (Ad-MafA, Ad-PDX-1, and Ad-NeuroD) and a control adenovirus (Ad-GFP), then injected each adenovirus into the cervical vein of 8-week-old male C57BL6 mice. To confirm that infected adenoviruses can express the target protein in the liver, we performed immunostaining for MafA, PDX-1, and NeuroD. As shown in Fig. 2A, MafA was clearly detected in the liver 3 days after infection with Ad-MafA. Similarly, PDX-1 and NeuroD were also clearly detected in the liver after infection with Ad-PDX-1 and AdNeuroD, respectively (data not shown). Also, to confirm that the adenovirus infected only the liver, we examined GFP expression in various tissues (brain, heart, lung, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney, fat, and muscle). GFP was expressed only in the liver, but not in any other tissues (data not shown). After the adenovirus infection, we evaluated insulin mRNA levels by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Since it is known that rodents have two insulin genes: insulin 1 and insulin 2, we examined which insulin gene is induced by such adenoviruses. As shown in Fig. 2B, neither insulin 1 nor 2 gene expression was induced by Ad-MafA alone, but both insulin 1 and 2 were induced by Ad-MafA plus Ad-PDX-1 or Ad-MafA plus Ad-NeuroD. It is noted that insulin 1 gene expression was induced only in the presence of MafA, suggesting that MafA plays a crucial role in inducing insulin gene expression. Larger amounts of insulin 1 and 2 mRNA expression were clearly observed in the liver after the triple infection (Ad-MafA, Ad-PDX-1, plus Ad-NeuroD). The effect of the triple infection was more profound compared with that of Ad-PDX-1 plus Ad-NeuroD infection. We further evaluated insulin mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2C, insulin mRNA expression was detected at all 3 days after the injection of Ad-MafA plus Ad-PDX-1 or Ad-MafA plus Ad-NeuroD. Furthermore, a much larger amount of insulin mRNA expression was induced by the triple infection (Ad-MafA, Ad-PDX-1, plus Ad-NeuroD). In addition, to examine various pancreas-related gene expression caused by ectopic expression of MafA, PDX-1, and/or NeuroD, we evaluated the mRNA expression of various pancreas-related genes. First, we examined the expression of β-cell-related genes: islet-type glucokinase, sulfonylurea receptor 1, and Kir6.2. As shown in Fig. 2D, mRNA expressions of various β-cell-related genes such as glucokinase, SUR1, and Kir6.2 were detected in the liver after treatment with Ad-MafA in the presence of PDX-1 and/or NeuroD but not detected after treatment with Ad-MafA alone. Similarly, mRNA expressions of various endocrine hormones such as glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide were also detected in the liver after treatment with Ad-MafA in the presence of PDX-1 and/or NeuroD but not detected after treatment with Ad-MafA alone. Somatostatin mRNA expression was detected only in the presence of PDX-1, highlighting the crucial role of PDX-1 in somatostatin gene expression. MafA Expression in the Liver, together with PDX-1 and NeuroD, Markedly Induces Insulin-producing Cells in the Liver— To examine whether insulin protein was synthesized and stored in the liver, we examined insulin protein expression in the liver after treatment with such adenoviruses. First, we measured insulin content in the liver after the adenovirus infection. As shown in Fig. 3A, insulin content was not detected in the liver treated with Ad-MafA alone but was detected after treatment with Ad-MafA in the presence of PDX-1 or NeuroD. Insulin content in the liver induced by MafA in the presence of PDX-1 or NeuroD was even larger than that by PDX-1 plus NeuroD. Also, as shown in Fig. 3B, insulin content in the liver was markedly increased after the triple infection (Ad-MafA, Ad-PDX-1, and Ad-NeuroD). In addition, to reconfirm insulin protein expression in the liver, we performed immunostaining for insulin. As shown in Fig. 3C, many insulin-positive cells (brown cells) were clearly observed in the liver after the triple infection. Such effects were not observed after any double infection (Ad-MafA plus Ad-PDX-1, Ad-MafA plus Ad-NeuroD, or Ad-PDX-1 plus Ad-NeuroD) (data not shown). Furthermore, to determine whether the produced insulin is secreted into the bloodstream, we measured serum insulin levels after the adenovirus infection. We injected 220 mg/kg STZ into C57BL6 mice, and 1 week later we treated the mice with the adenoviruses. As shown in Fig. 3D, serum insulin levels were moderately increased after treatment with Ad-MafA plus Ad-PDX-1 or Ad-MafA plus Ad-NeuroD and were markedly increased after the triple infection (Ad-MafA, Ad-PDX-1, and Ad-NeuroD). Taken together, MafA expression, together with PDX-1 and NeuroD, drastically induces insulin content (Fig. 3, A–C) and secretion (Fig. 3D), in addition to induction of insulin promoter activity (Fig. 1, A and B) and mRNA expression (Fig. 2, B and C). MafA Expression in the Liver, together with PDX-1 and NeuroD, Dramatically Ameliorates Glucose Tolerance in Diabetic Model Animals—We examined whether hepatic insulin production induced by combination of MafA, PDX-1, and NeuroD is capable of controlling blood glucose levels in STZ-induced diabetic mice. As shown in Fig. 4A, 3 days after adenovirus injection, blood glucose levels were decreased by MafA plus PDX-1, MafA plus NeuroD, or PDX-1 plus NeuroD, although no such effect was observed after infection of Ad-MafA alone. Furthermore, blood glucose levels were dramatically decreased by the triple infection (Ad-MafA, Ad-PDX-1, and Ad-NeuroD). The effects of triple infection were much more pronounced compared with those in any single or double infection. It is noted that, despite the marked effects of MafA expression, together with PDX-1 and NeuroD, the mice did not become hypoglycemia. In addition, we performed the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test at 3 and 14 days after the adenovirus injection. As shown in Fig. 2B, there was a marked difference in glucose tolerance at any time point after glucose load between Ad-GFP-treated mice and the mice treated with Ad-MafA, Ad-PDX-1, and Ad-NeuroD. In this study we examined the effects of adenovirus-mediated expression of a recently identified pancreatic β-cell-specific transcription factor MafA on insulin gene expression and glucose tolerance with and without PDX-1 and/or NeuroD and found that MafA overexpression, together with PDX-1 and NeuroD, drastically induces insulin production in the liver (Figs. 2 and 3) and ameliorates glucose tolerance in diabetic animal models (Fig. 4). The marked effects of MafA expression, together with PDX-1 and NeuroD, on insulin production and glucose tolerance indicate that MafA plays an important role in inducing insulin-producing cells and thus should be a novel therapeutic target for diabetes and that combination therapy should be very efficient and useful for replacing the reduced insulin biosynthesis found in diabetes and for amelioration of glucose tolerance. In addition, despite the marked effects of MafA expression, together with PDX-1 and NeuroD, the mice did not become hypoglycemia. These results imply that some glucose-mediated regulation of insulin production and/or secretion is achieved by the triple infection. There are several possible reasons to explain why the triple infection (Ad-MafA, Ad-PDX-1, plus Ad-NeuroD) is much more effective compared with any single or double infection. One possibility is that marked induction of insulin mRNA expression by the triple infection is simply due to increase of insulin promoter activity because insulin promoter activity per se is most significantly increased by the triple transfection (Fig. 1A). Another is that the transcription partners are recruited to the insulin promoter region by MafA, together with PDX-1 and NeuroD, which would enable these transcription factors to exert strong synergistic effects and to markedly induce insulin gene expression. Both PDX-1 and NeuroD are known to associate functionally with the co-activator p300 and thereby exert strong effects on the insulin gene transcription (22Qiu Y. Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2957-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Mutoh H. Naya F.J. Tsai M.J. Leiter A.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24Sharma A.

Thus, although not examined in this study, we assume that some transcriptional partner such as p300 contributes to the marked effects of triple overexpression on insulin gene expression. In addition, since p300 is known to interact with transcriptional adaptors such as a particular histone acetyltransferase and to be involved in chromatin remodeling complexes (27Qiu Y. Guo M. Huang S. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9796-9802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Mosley A.L. Corbett J.A. Ozcan S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2279-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), it is possible that recruited p300 to the insulin gene promoter region facilitates histone acetylation and thus contributes to the marked effects of triple overexpression on insulin gene expression. In conclusion, MafA overexpression, together with PDX-1 and NeuroD, drastically induces insulin production in the liver and ameliorates glucose intolerance in diabetic animal models, indicating that MafA plays an important role in inducing insulin-producing cells and thus should be a novel therapeutic target for diabetes and that combination therapy should be very efficient and useful for replacing the reduced insulin biosynthesis found in diabetes and for amelioration of glucose intolerance.

Increasing Insulin ProductionJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 280Issue 15PreviewDiabetes, which is marked by high blood sugar levels, results when the body is unable to produce a sufficient amount of insulin or when it is unable to use insulin properly. In the diabetic state, chronic hyperglycemia decreases insulin gene expression and secretion. Although normal blood sugar levels can be restored by pancreas and islet transplantation, this requires life-long immunosuppressive therapy and is limited by tissue supply. An alternative is to enhance insulin gene transcription and induce insulin-producing cells. Full-Text PDF Open Access"

We isolated IbpA, the Escherichia coli small heat shock protein, and tested its ability to keep thermally inactivated substrate proteins in a disaggregation competent state. We found that the presence of IbpA alone during substrate thermal inactivation only weakly influences the ability of the bi-chaperone Hsp70-Hsp100 system to disaggregate aggregated substrate. Similar minor effects were observed for IbpB alone, the other E. coli small heat shock protein. However, when both IbpA and IbpB are simultaneously present during substrate inactivation they efficiently stabilize thermally aggregated proteins in a disaggregation competent state. The properties of the aggregated protein substrates are changed in the presence of IbpA and IbpB, resulting in lower hydrophobicity and the ability of aggregates to withstand sizing chromatography conditions. IbpA and IbpB form mixed complexes, and IbpA stimulates association of IbpB with substrate. The small heat shock proteins are ubiquitous stress proteins proposed to increase cellular tolerance to heat shock conditions. We isolated IbpA, the Escherichia coli small heat shock protein, and tested its ability to keep thermally inactivated substrate proteins in a disaggregation competent state. We found that the presence of IbpA alone during substrate thermal inactivation only weakly influences the ability of the bi-chaperone Hsp70-Hsp100 system to disaggregate aggregated substrate. Similar minor effects were observed for IbpB alone, the other E. coli small heat shock protein. However, when both IbpA and IbpB are simultaneously present during substrate inactivation they efficiently stabilize thermally aggregated proteins in a disaggregation competent state. The properties of the aggregated protein substrates are changed in the presence of IbpA and IbpB, resulting in lower hydrophobicity and the ability of aggregates to withstand sizing chromatography conditions. IbpA and IbpB form mixed complexes, and IbpA stimulates association of IbpB with substrate. The proper conformation of proteins is challenged by stress conditions. Exposure to extreme heat shock conditions results in a massive aggregation of proteins inside both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (1.Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S.

Chaperones from the Hsp100 family, that is ClpB in Escherichia coli and Hsp104 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were implicated in the disaggregation reaction, because aggregated proteins were not eliminated in either clpB or HSP104 deletion strains (1.Parsell D.A.

Additionally, the clpB and HSP104 gene products were identified as factors conferring thermotolerance in E. coli and S. cerevisiae (4.Squires C.L. Pendersen S. Ross B. Squires C. J.

However, in vitro studies on the reactivation of aggregated proteins showed that chaperones from the Hsp100 family alone are not sufficient for disaggregation and refolding. Other chaperone proteins are also involved in this process. E. coli Hsp70 (DnaK) and its cochaperones (DnaJ and GrpE) cooperate with ClpB and form a bi-chaperone system capable of efficient disaggregation of aggregated proteins (3.Mogk A. Tomoyasu T.

Analogous Hsp100-Hsp70 bi-chaperone systems able to disaggregate denatured protein substrates in vitro were established using chaperones from other bacterial species (10.Motohashi K. Watanabe T. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), as well as from yeast cytosol (11.Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) and mitochondria (12.Krzewska J. Langer T. Liberek K.

However, the efficiency of refolding reaction catalyzed by these bi-chaperone systems depends strongly on the physical properties of protein aggregates. It was proposed that small heat shock proteins (sHsps) 1The abbreviations used are: sHsp, small heat shock protein(s); IbpA, inclusion body associated protein A; IbpB, inclusion body associated protein B; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; bis-ANS, 1,1′-bi(4-anilino)-naphtalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: sHsp, small heat shock protein(s); IbpA, inclusion body associated protein A; IbpB, inclusion body associated protein B; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; bis-ANS, 1,1′-bi(4-anilino)-naphtalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid. associate with aggregated proteins and change their physical properties in such a way that chaperone-mediated disaggregation and refolding become much more efficient (14.Lee G.J.

Small heat shock proteins are widely distributed both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Members of this diverse protein family are characterized by relatively low monomeric molecular masses (15–43 kDa) and a conserved stretch of ∼100 amino acid residues (reviewed in Refs. 20.Haslbeck M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1649-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar and 21.Narberhaus F. Microbiol. Molecular Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 64-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). This so-called α-crystallin domain displays sequence similarities to the vertebrate eye lens protein α-crystallin, which prevents protein precipitation and cataract formation in the eye lens. One of the most striking features of sHsps is their organization in large oligomeric structures (reviewed in Refs. 20.Haslbeck M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1649-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar and 21.Narberhaus F. Microbiol. Molecular Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 64-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The interactions between sHsp subunits in these oligomers are highly dynamic, and under physiological conditions, rapid exchange between subunits of these oligomers has been observed (22.Bova M.P.

Moreover, the temperature induces changes in the oligomerization state of sHsps complexes (20.Haslbeck M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1649-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 21.Narberhaus F. Microbiol. Molecular Biol.

Surprisingly, in many cases deletion of genes encoding sHsps does not result in strong phenotypic effects, making it difficult to clearly assign them a function in the chaperone network. It has been reported, however, that overproduction of sHsps conveys thermotolerance in a number of organisms and cell types, suggesting the involvement of sHsps in the control of protein aggregation and disaggregation processes upon heat shock (28.Landry J. Chretien P. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 29.Van den Ijssel P.R. Overkamp P. Knauf U. Gaestel M. de Jong W.W.

Matsumura Y. Tsuchido T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 184: 165-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several in vitro studies have reported that sHsps can prevent the aggregation of heat-denatured proteins (32.Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 33.Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1996; 22: 555-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 35.Allen S.P. Polazzi J.O. Gierse J.K. Easton A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 174: 6938-6947Crossref Google Scholar, 36.Basha E.

Two members of the sHsp family, IbpA and IbpB, are present in E. coli. The IbpA and IbpB proteins are 48% identical at the amino acid sequence level (37.Chuang S.E. Burland V. Plunkett G. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and both were identified as proteins associated with inclusion bodies (35.Allen S.P. Polazzi J.O. Gierse J.K. Easton A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 174: 6938-6947Crossref Google Scholar). IbpA/IbpB were also found in aggregated protein fractions following heat stress (2.Laskowska E. Kuczyńska-Wiśnik D. Skórko-Glonek J. Taylor A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 555-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The deletion of the ibpAB genes results in a weak phenotype manifested only at extreme temperatures (38.Kuczyńska-Wiśnik D. Kêdzierska S. Matuszewska E. Lund P. Taylor A. Lipińska B. Laskowska E. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1757-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Prolonged incubation of such mutant cells at 50 °C results in a decrease of viability, which correlates with an increase in protein aggregation (38.Kuczyńska-Wiśnik D. Kêdzierska S. Matuszewska E. Lund P. Taylor A. Lipińska B. Laskowska E. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1757-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To date, only IbpB has been studied in detail. Purified IbpB forms 2- to 3-MDa oligomers, which, upon exposure to high temperature, dissociate into smaller ∼600-kDa structures (39.Shearstone J.R. Baneyx F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 40.Kitagawa M. Miyakawa M. Matsumara Y. Tsuchido T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2907-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The importance of these structural changes is not well understood. IbpB protein was shown in vitro to suppress thermal aggregation of model substrate proteins in a concentration-dependent manner (39.Shearstone J.R. Baneyx F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, IbpB was also tested for the ability to cooperate with chaperones from the Hsp70 and Hsp100 families in substrate disaggregation and refolding (16.Veinger L. Diamant S. Buchner J. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11032-11037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 18.Mogk A. Deuerling E. Vorderwulbecke S. Vierling E. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The presence of IbpB during the heat inactivation of both malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and lactate dehydrogenase results in more efficient reactivation of these enzymes by the Hsp70 system (DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE) (16.Veinger L. Diamant S. Buchner J. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11032-11037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) as well as by the bi-chaperone Hsp70-Hsp100 system (ClpB-DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE) (18.Mogk A. Deuerling E. Vorderwulbecke S. Vierling E. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 19.Mogk A. Schlieker C. Friedrich K.L. Schönfeld H.-J. Vierling E. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31033-31042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, the details, if any, of cooperation between IbpB and the ClpB-DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system are unknown. No such detailed studies have been performed for the other E. coli sHsp, IbpA. Only recently, IbpA with a hexahistidine tag at its N terminus was isolated and shown to form multimers (40.Kitagawa M. Miyakawa M. Matsumara Y. Tsuchido T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2907-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similarly to IbpB, it also has a protective effect on several tested substrate proteins subjected to thermal and oxidative stress (40.Kitagawa M. Miyakawa M. Matsumara Y. Tsuchido T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2907-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, it was not determined if the presence of IbpA during thermal inactivation of substrate protein results in subsequent efficient disaggregation by the ClpB-DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperones. It is also not known whether IbpA interacts with IbpB and if these small chaperones cooperate in the modification of aggregates during thermal denaturation of substrate proteins. Here, we present results which answer the above questions. We observed that the presence of purified IbpA alone during thermal inactivation very weakly influences the ability of the bi-chaperone system (ClpB-DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE) to disaggregate aggregated substrate. A similar minor effect was observed for purified IbpB alone. However, when both IbpA and IbpB are simultaneously present during substrate inactivation, efficient stabilization of thermally aggregated proteins in a disaggregation competent state was observed, indicating that both sHsps work together as an integrated system. Protein Purification—The IbpA protein was overproduced in the MC4100ΔibpA/B strain transformed with the pUC18-derived pCA plasmid bearing the ibpA gene, under control of the ptac promoter (38.Kuczyńska-Wiśnik D. Kêdzierska S. Matuszewska E. Lund P. Taylor A. Lipińska B. Laskowska E. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1757-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Bacteria overproducing IbpA protein were lysed in a French press (Aminco) in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl). The bacterial lysate was clarified for 30 min at 26,000 rpm in a Beckman 30.5 rotor. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer A containing 2 m urea. After 1-h incubation on ice followed by centrifugation (30 min at 26,000 rpm in a Beckman 30.5 rotor), the pellet was resuspended in buffer A containing 6 m urea. After another 1-h incubation on ice and centrifugation (30 min at 26,000 rpm in a Beckman 30.5 rotor), the protein extract was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A containing 6 m urea. The proteins bound to this column were eluted with a KCl gradient (100–300 mm) in buffer A supplemented with 6 m urea. Fractions containing pure IbpA, eluted at the end of the gradient, were pooled together. The urea present in the protein preparation was slowly dialyzed out by sequential dialysis to buffer A containing 4 m, 2 m, 1 m, and no urea. The IbpB protein was overproduced in the MC4100ΔibpA/B strain transformed with the pUC18 derived pCB plasmid bearing the ibpB gene under control of the ptac promoter (38.Kuczyńska-Wiśnik D. Kêdzierska S. Matuszewska E. Lund P. Taylor A. Lipińska B. Laskowska E. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1757-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). IbpB was purified using the protocol described previously (39.Shearstone J.R. Baneyx F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To obtain the IbpB and IbpA proteins carrying a hexahistidine tag at the N terminus, pETHis-B and pETHis-A plasmids were constructed by cloning the ibpB or ibpA genes into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET28b+ vector (Novagen). The His-IbpB and His-IbpA proteins encoded by these plasmids have an additional 20-amino acid residues, which includes the hexahistidine tag, at the N terminus. These fusion proteins were overproduced in the BL21(DE3) ΔibpA/B strain. The purification of His-IbpB and His-IbpA was based on the interaction of the His tag with Ni-NTA-agarose under denaturing conditions. Published protocols were used for the purification of Escherichia coli DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE (41.Zylicz M. Ang D. Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and ClpB (42.Woo K.M. Kim K.L. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase (E 1701) was purchased from Promega. Malate dehydrogenase (MDH) was purchased from Sigma (410-13). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford (Bio-Rad) assay system, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Molar concentrations are given assuming a hexameric structure for ClpB and a monomeric structure for the rest of the proteins. Luciferase Inactivation and Refolding Experiments—For inactivation, luciferase (1.5 μm) in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm dithiothreitol) was incubated at different temperatures for 10 min in the presence of IbpA and IbpB as stated in the figure legends. For disaggregation and refolding, the inactivated luciferase (42 nm) was incubated at 25 °C in buffer B supplemented with ATP (5 mm), ATP regeneration system (10 mm phosphocreatine and 100 μg/ml phosphocreatine kinase), and chaperone proteins (3 μm DnaK, 0.24 μm DnaJ, 0.3 μm GrpE, and 3 μm ClpB) as indicated. Following 1 h of incubation, luciferase activity was determined in a Beckman scintillation counter using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). In the control experiment it was shown that luciferase activity increases linearly with time during refolding for at least 1 h. MDH Inactivation and Refolding Experiments—Experiments were essentially performed as described previously (16.Veinger L. Diamant S. Buchner J. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11032-11037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). MDH (2 μm) in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm MgCl2) was inactivated at the indicated temperatures in the presence of IbpA (2 μm) and IbpB (7.8 μm). The disaggregation and refolding reaction was performed with MDH (90 nm) in buffer C supplemented with ATP (5 mm), an ATP regeneration system (10 mm phosphocreatine and 100 μg/ml phosphocreatine kinase) and chaperone proteins (3 μm DnaK, 0.24 μm DnaJ, 0.3 μm GrpE, and 3 μm ClpB) at 25 °C. MDH activity was measured as described before (43.Diamant S. Azem A. Weiss C. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28387-28391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), at 25 °C in 150 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm oxaloacetate, and 0.28 mm NADH. Sizing Chromatography of Protein Complexes—Luciferase or MDH, following denaturation at different temperatures in the presence of IbpA and IbpB when indicated, was subjected to sizing chromatography on a Sepharose 4BCl column (0.5 × 15 cm) equilibrated in buffer C. Proteins present in fractions (100 μl) following sizing chromatography were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Chromatography resin from the sizing column was removed and discarded after each separation to avoid any contamination of the resin with the aggregated proteins. Isolation of Protein Complexes by Interaction with Ni-NTA-agarose Resin—His-IbpB (6 μm) and IbpA (6 μm), or His-IbpA (6 μm) and IbpB (6 μm), and MDH (8.6 μm), as indicated, were incubated in buffer C lacking dithiothreitol at different temperatures in a 35-μl reaction volume. After 20 min of incubation, Ni-NTA-agarose (20 μl) was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min. Next, the supernatant was discarded, and the Ni-NTA-agarose was washed several times with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. Proteins bound to the resin were eluted with the same buffer containing 300 mm imidazole and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Purification of IbpA Protein—Two small heat shock proteins, namely IbpA and IbpB, were identified in E. coli. IbpB has been purified and studied previously (39.Shearstone J.R. Baneyx F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but, until now, no detailed biochemical studies had been performed on IbpA. IbpA was overproduced in E. coli and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1). Previous studies showed that IbpA, either induced by heat shock conditions (38.Kuczyńska-Wiśnik D. Kêdzierska S. Matuszewska E. Lund P. Taylor A. Lipińska B. Laskowska E. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1757-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or overproduced (39.Shearstone J.R. Baneyx F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), was found in the fast sedimenting fraction of cellular extracts containing membranes and aggregated proteins, but not in the soluble fractions. Therefore, we extracted IbpA from these aggregates by dissolving them in 6 m urea. Further steps of the purification were performed under denaturing conditions. At the final step of the purification urea was slowly dialyzed out from the IbpA preparation. Following such a procedure, soluble IbpA protein was obtained. The purified IbpA formed high molecular weight oligomeric structures that deoligomerized into smaller structures following incubation at 48 °C (results not shown).

We used this assay to investigate the chaperone activity of purified IbpA. Firefly luciferase was thermally denatured at 48 °C in the presence or absence of IbpA, followed by the addition of ClpB (Hsp100) and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE (Hsp70 and cochaperones). Following 1-h reactivation at 25 °C, the luciferase activity was tested. The presence of IbpA during luciferase denaturation did not increase the efficiency of its refolding by the ClpB-K/J/E bi-chaperone system, although a wide range of IbpA concentrations was tested for a possible stabilizing effect (Fig. 2A). Because both ibpA and ibpB are located in one operon in E. coli (37.Chuang S.E. Burland V. Plunkett G. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and it was shown that sHsps from other bacteria form heterooligomers (34.Studer S. Narberhaus F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37212-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), it is plausible that IbpA and IbpB cooperate in substrate stabilization during thermal stress. Therefore, we purified IbpB (Fig. 1) and included it in our in vitro reactivation experiments. The presence of IbpB alone during luciferase denaturation only slightly increased (from 14% to 33%) the efficiency of luciferase refolding by the ClpB-K/J/E chaperone system (Fig. 2B). Moreover, this effect was observed only for high concentrations of IbpB. However, when both IbpB and IbpA were added simultaneously to the reaction, a significant increase in luciferase activity was observed following reactivation by the ClpB-K/J/E chaperones (Fig. 2). To find the optimal concentrations of IbpA and IbpB necessary for this stabilizing effect, titrations of both small chaperones were performed. The most efficient reactivation was observed for ∼2 μm IbpA (Fig. 2A) and ∼7.8 μm IbpB (Fig. 2B). Therefore these concentrations of sHsps were used throughout this report in reactivation experiments. We also tested at which step of the denaturation/reactivation process the simultaneous presence of IbpA and IbpB was required. IbpA/IbpB when present during either the thermal inactivation step or the reactivation step, and in the absence of the ClpB-K/J/E bi-chaperone system, were not able to protect or to recover luciferase activity (Fig. 2C). Moreover, thermal denaturation followed by addition of IbpA/B and bi-chaperone system to the reactivation mixture did not result in an efficiency of reactivation higher than that observed for the bi-chaperone system alone. Only when the IbpA/B proteins were present during the thermal denaturation step, followed by subsequent addition of the bi-chaperone system, was the efficient recovery of luciferase activity observed (Fig. 2C). Thus we concluded that the presence of both IbpA and IbpB during thermal inactivation of luciferase is required for efficient reactivation mediated by the bi-chaperone Hsp70-Hsp100 system. Simultaneous Presence of IbpA and IbpB Results in Stabilization of the Substrate in a Disaggregation Competent State— Because in vivo studies identified the IbpA/B proteins as factors responsible for increasing E. coli thermotolerance (31.Kitagawa M. Matsumura Y. Tsuchido T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 184: 165-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to test the ability of IbpA/B to protect substrate proteins over a wide range of temperatures. First, we tested if IbpA/B are able to maintain the enzymatic activity of luciferase exposed to different temperatures. To this end, luciferase was incubated at the indicated temperatures for 10 min in the presence of IbpA/B, and its activity was assayed directly after incubation. No protective effect of IbpA/B was observed at high temperatures (above 42 °C). However, under mild heat shock conditions (36–40 °C), the minor level of luciferase protection was observed, and the luciferase activity was detected at the level of 20–30% of native control (Fig. 3A). Next, we tested how different temperatures affect the ability of IbpA and IbpB alone or in combination to maintain luciferase in a st"

We showed previously that flow activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) via Src kinase-dependent transactivation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). The scaffold protein Gab1 plays an important role in receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signal transduction. We found here that laminar flow (shear stress = 12 dynes/cm2) rapidly stimulated Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation in both bovine aortic endothelial cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which correlated with activation of Akt and eNOS. Gab1 phosphorylation as well as activation of Akt and eNOS by flow was inhibited by the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) and VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors SU1498 and VTI, suggesting that flow-mediated Gab1 phosphorylation is Src kinase-dependent and VEGFR2-dependent. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 by flow was functionally important, because flow stimulated the association of Gab1 with the PI3K subunit p85 in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, transfection of a Gab1 mutant lacking p85 binding sites inhibited flow-induced activation of Akt and eNOS. Finally, knockdown of endogenous Gab1 by small interference RNA abrogated flow activation of Akt and eNOS. These data demonstrate a critical role of Gab1 in flow-stimulated PI3K/Akt/eNOS signal pathway in endothelial cells.

Vascular endothelial cells, which form the inner lining of the blood vessel wall, are exposed to fluid shear stress, the dragging force generated by blood flow. Substantial evidence shows that flow modulates endothelial structure and function and is a major determinant of vascular remodeling, arterial tone, and atherogenesis (1.Davies P.F. Physiol.

Recently we have found that flow rapidly activates vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in a ligand-independent but Src-kinase-dependent manner, which leads to activation of Akt and eNOS in endothelial cells (18.Jin Z.G.

However, the proximal mechanisms for flow-mediated PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling pathway via VEGFR2 remain unclear.

Gab1 contains an amino-terminal PH domain, several proline-rich sequences, and multiple binding sites (phosphotyrosines) for SH2 domain-containing proteins. Gab1 rapidly becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation of appropriate cells with growth factors (27.Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab1 binds multiple signaling molecules, including the PI3K subunit p85 (21.Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), but its function and regulation has been little studied. Here, we show that flow stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 in an Src kinase-dependent and VEGFR2-dependent manner in endothelial cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 is functionally important, because flow stimulates association of Gab1 with p85 and inhibiting Gab1 function and expression decreases flow-induced Akt and eNOS activation. These data demonstrate a critical role of Gab1 in flow-mediated PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling in endothelial cells. Reagents—VTI (VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 4-[(4′-chloro-2′-fluoro)phenylamino]-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline), SU1498, PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine), and herbimycin A were purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-phospho eNOS antibody (Ser-1179 in bovine eNOS sequence, p-eNOS), anti-phospho-Akt antibody (Ser-473, p-Akt), and anti-Akt antibody were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Anti-eNOS monoclonal antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (pY-4G10), anti-PI3K p85 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Gab1 polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Ueba H. Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O. Frame M.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from human umbilical veins and grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), heparin (Sigma), and endothelial cell growth factors (isolated from bovine brain) (33.Jin Z.G.

Confluent cells cultured in 60-mm dishes were serum-starved for 24 h and exposed to laminar flow (shear stress = 12 dyn/cm2) in a cone and plate viscometer (18.Jin Z.G. Ueba H. Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O.

For the inhibitor studies, cells were pretreated with various inhibitors for 30 min in serum-depleted medium. Gab1 Mutant and Transfection—Mammalian expression constructs for cDNA encoding FLAG-tagged human Gab1 construct, Gab1ΔPI3K (Y447F/Y472F/Y589F, lacking three PI3K binding sites) were created by site-specific mutagenesis as described previously (34.Cunnick J.M.

For transient transfection, BAECs were seeded in 60-mm dishes 24 h before transfection to yield a 60% confluent culture on the day of transfection. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine, according to the supplier's instructions described previously (35.Tai L.K. Okuda M. Abe J. Yan C. Berk B.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1790-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, the cells were used for flow experiments. Gab1 siRNA and Its Transfection—To determine the contribution of Gab1 in flow-stimulated signaling, we treated HUVECs with human Gab1 siRNA duplex obtained from Dharmacon, Inc. The sequences of specific siRNA against human Gab1 were sense GAGAGUGGAUUAUGUUGUUUU and antisense 5′-PAACAACAUAAUCCACUCUCUU. The scrambled siRNA control was a nontargeting siRNA pool from Dharmacon, Inc. For transfection of siRNA, HUVECs were seeded into 60-mm dishes for 24 h about 80% confluence, and then transfection of siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Flow stimulation was performed 48 h after siRNA transfection. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and clarified by centrifugation (18.Jin Z.G.

The protein concentration of the lysate was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California). Equal amounts of protein were incubated with specific antibody overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Then protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz, California) was added and incubated for additional 2 h. Then the beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer, and immune complexes were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Total immune complex samples or protein samples from total cell lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies. After washing and incubating with secondary antibodies, immunoreactive proteins were visualized by using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Where indicated, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with another antibody. Densitometric analyses of immunoblots were performed by National Institutes of Health Image. Results were normalized by arbitrarily setting the densitometry of control cells to 1.0. Statistical Analysis—Group differences were analyzed using the standard Student's t test. All values are expressed as means ± S.E. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Flow Stimulates Rapid Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Gab1 in Endothelial Cells—To gain insight into flow-mediated signaling events downstream of VEGFR2 (18.Jin Z.G. Ueba H. Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O. Frame M.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), we studied tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1. BAECs were exposed to flow for varying times and harvested for analysis of Gab1 phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 occurred within 2 min, peaked at 15 min (5.7 ± 0.6-fold increase), was sustained for 30 min (Fig. 1, A (upper panel) and B), and returned to near baseline by 120 min after stimulation (not shown). There was no significant change in Gab1 protein levels during these experiments (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Consistent with the results reported previously (18.Jin Z.G. Ueba H. Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O. Frame M.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), both Akt and eNOS were time-dependently phosphorylated in response to flow in BAECs (Fig. 1C). Flow also stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 in HUVECs in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B), although slower compared with BAECs. Akt and eNOS were time-dependently phosphorylated in response to flow in HUVECs (Fig. 2C). The time course for Gab1 phosphorylation is correlated with that for Akt and eNOS activation by flow in both BAECs and HUVECs (Figs. 1 and 2), suggesting that Gab1 phosphorylation might be involved in Akt and eNOS activation by flow in endothelial cells. Src Kinases and VGEFR2 Are Involved in Flow-induced Gab1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation—To characterize the tyrosine kinase responsible for flow-induced Gab1 phosphorylation, we first utilized the Src tyrosine kinase inhibitors, herbimycin A and PP2. Treatment with 1 μm herbimycin A abrogated flow-mediated Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). Herbimycin A also abolished activation of Akt and eNOS by flow (Fig. 3A). Similarly, 10 μm PP2 inhibited flow-mediated Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Treatment with PP2 inhibited activation of Akt and eNOS as well (Fig. 3B). These results strongly suggested that Src family tyrosine kinases play an important role in flow-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation as well as activation of Akt and eNOS in endothelial cells. We showed previously that VEGFR2 tyrosine phosphorylation by flow was Src kinase-dependent, and VEGFR2 was required for flow-mediated PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling (18.Jin Z.G. Ueba H. Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O. Frame M.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To examine the role of VEGFR2 in flow-mediated Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation, we studied the effects of SU1498 and VTI, two structurally different VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors. Treatment with 10 μm VTI significantly inhibited flow-mediated Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). VTI also significantly inhibited activation of Akt and eNOS by flow (Fig. 4A). Similar effects were observed when cells were treated with SU1498 (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation by flow is Src kinase- and VEGFR2 kinase-dependent, similar to flow-induced activation of Akt and eNOS (18.Jin Z.G. Ueba H. Tanimoto T.

Gab1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation by Flow Mediates Activation of Akt and eNOS in Endothelial Cells—To gain insight into the functional significance of Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation in flow-mediated signaling events, we determined whether flow increases the association of Gab1 with PI3K in endothelial cells as reported for growth factor-stimulated cells (28.Holgado-Madruga M.

BAECs were exposed to flow for various times indicated in Fig. 5A, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Gab1 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-p85 antibody. Immunoprecipitation of Gab1 after exposure of BAECs to flow showed a significant increase in co-immunoprecipitated p85 (Fig. 5A), To examine the role of Gab1 in flow-induced activation of Akt and eNOS, the downstream signaling molecules of PI3K, we transfected BAECs with the mutant Gab1ΔPI3K (Y434F, Y343F, and Y243F) lacking PI3K binding sites (21.Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 28.Holgado-Madruga M. Moscatello D.K. Emlet D.R. Dieterich R. Wong A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), which has dominant negative effect on growth factor-induced the recruitment and activation of PI3K (21.Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 28.Holgado-Madruga M. Moscatello D.K. Emlet D.R. Dieterich R. Wong A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although transfection efficiency is ∼40% in BAECs, overexpressed Gab1ΔPI3K significantly decreased Akt activation in response to flow (Fig. 5, B and C), indicating that Gab1/PI3K interaction is responsible for Akt activation. Moreover, eNOS activation was also attenuated by overexpression of Gab1ΔPI3K in endothelial cells (Fig. 5, B and C). Knockdown of Gab1 by siRNA Inhibited Flow-induced Activation of Akt and eNOS in Endothelial Cells—To further support the critical role of Gab1 in flow-induced PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling, we knocked down endogenous Gab1 in endothelial cells using siRNA. Transfection of HUVECs with human Gab1 siRNA significantly reduced endogenous Gab1 expression, whereas control siRNA had no effect (Fig. 6A). Gab1 siRNA is specific for targeting Gab1, because expression of β-actin, Akt, and eNOS were not changed (Fig. 6A). Decreasing Gab1 expression by siRNA significantly inhibited flow-induced activation of Akt and eNOS in HUVECs (Fig. 6, A and B). The major findings of the present study are that flow stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 in a Src kinase-dependent and VEGFR2-dependent manner, and that tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab1 is required for flow-induced activation of Akt and eNOS in endothelial cells. We found that Gab1 is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in both BAECs and HUVECs in response to flow, which are correlated with activation of Akt and eNOS. Inhibition of Src kinases or VEGFR2 kinase with specific inhibitors significantly reduced flow-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and activation of Akt and eNOS. Furthermore, flow stimulated association of Gab1 with the PI3K subunit p85 in a time-dependent manner, and transfection of Gab1 mutant lacking p85 binding sites into endothelial cells inhibited flow-mediated activation of Akt and eNOS. Finally, knockdown of Gab1 by siRNA attenuated flow-induced activation of Akt and eNOS in endothelial cells. This is the first report to show a critical role of Gab1, a scaffold adaptor protein, in the fluid shear stress-mediated PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway in endothelial cells. Gab1 has multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites that serve as binding sites for the SH2 domains of PI3K, phospholipase C-γ, SHP2, and CrkL (27.Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 28.Holgado-Madruga M. Moscatello D.K. Emlet D.R. Dieterich R. Wong A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30630-30637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Gab1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to many growth factors and cytokines, resulting in activation of both the Ras/MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades (21.Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 22.Nishida K. Hirano T. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 23.Gu H. Neel B.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Here we show for the first time that mechanotransduction via fluid shear stress rapidly induces Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation in endothelial cells. In recognizing the significance of tyrosine phosphorylation induced on Gab1 by flow, the critical issue was to determine which one or more tyrosine kinases are responsible for this phosphorylation event. We have previously shown that Src kinases and VEGFR2 are implicated in the cellular response to flow (18.Jin Z.G. Ueba H. Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O. Frame M.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), therefore we evaluated the putative role of Src kinases and VEGFR2 in flow-induced Gab1 phosphorylation using selective inhibitors, herbimycin, PP2, VTI, and SU1498, respectively. These experiments show that these inhibitors significantly attenuated tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS by flow, indicating that Src kinases and VEGFR2 participate in flow-induced Gab1 phosphorylation as well as activation of Akt and eNOS in endothelial cells. We previously showed that flow induced PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway through Src kinases and VEGFR2 in endothelial cells (18.Jin Z.G. Ueba H. Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O. Frame M.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), but it is still not clear whether flow-stimulated VEGFR2 recruits and activates PI3K directly. VEGFR2 has several potential PI3K binding sites, many of them have been shown to be involved in activation of PI3K and Akt (38.Dayanir V. Meyer R.D. Lashkari K. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17686-17692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), but none of them has been clearly shown to directly recruit p85 of PI3K (39.Claesson-Welsh L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 20-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Zachary I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1171-1177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show that activation of VEGFR2 by flow induces PI3K-Akt-eNOS activation in endothelial cells through the tyrosine phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab1. Based on our data published previously (18.Jin Z.G. Ueba H. Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O. Frame M.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and the results from this study, we propose that flow stimulates activation of Src kinases and transactivates VEGFR2. VEGFR2 activation results in recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of the scaffold adaptor Gab1. Phosphorylation of Gab1 leads to recruitment of PI3K, and the association of Gab1 with PI3K is required for activation of Akt, which induces eNOS activation and subsequently NO production in endothelial cells. It is well documented that VEGF stimulates VEGFR2 and PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling in endothelial cells (16.Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar, 41.Papapetropoulos A. Garcia C.-G. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Therefore, it will be interesting to know whether the function of Gab1 is specific for mechanosignaling or involved in signal transduction of VEGFR2 activated by both flow and VEGF. The role of Gab1 in VEGF-induced signaling is under investigation. In summary, our data show that Src kinase- and VEGFR2- dependent Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation by flow mediates activation of Akt and eNOS in endothelial cells. Because endothelial-derived NO from eNOS is an important mediator for maintaining endothelial normal function and a negative regulator of vascular inflammation (4.Tedgui A. Mallat Z. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 5.Zeiher A. Lancet. 1996; 348: s10-s12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 42.Tsao P.S. Buitrago R. Chan J.R. Cooke J.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), we suggest that flow-mediated Gab1 phosphorylation may be involved in atheroprotective effect of laminar flow."

Although it is now clear that IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) is a multifunctional gene essential for induction of type I IFNs, regulation of the IRF7 promoter (IRF7p) is poorly understood. The IRF7 gene includes two IFN responsive elements, an IRF-binding element (IRFE) in the promoter region and an ISRE in the first intron, and is induced by the IFN-triggered Jak-STAT pathway by binding of the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex to the ISRE. In this study, we demonstrate that IRF3 and IRF7, which with the coactivators CREB-binding protein and P300 form the virus-activated factor (VAF) complex upon Sendai virus infection, bind to the IRF7 ISRE and IRFE and can directly activate IRF7 transcription. Promoter reporter assays show that both the ISRE and IRFE are responsive to activation by IRF7 and IRF3. In cells transiently expressing IRF7 or/and IRF3, the VAF level and binding of VAF are clearly increased after Sendai virus infection. Studies with Jak1 kinase inactive 293 cells that were stably transfected with a Jak1 kinase dead dominant negative construct, and the mutant cell lines SAN (IFNα–/β–), U2A (IRF9–), U4A (Jak1–), and DKO (IRF1–/IRF2–) show that the IRF7 transcription activated directly by VAF is distinct from and independent of the IFN signaling pathway. Thus, IRF7 transcription is autoregulated by binding of the IRF7-containing VAF to its own ISRE and IRFE. The results show two distinct mechanisms for the activation of the IRF7 promoter, by IFN and by virus infection. A regulatory network between type I IFNs and IRF7 is proposed. The distinct pathways may reflect special roles for an efficient antiviral response at different stages of virus infection.

Virol. 2003; 77: 9359-9368Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) possess ISRE motifs and are regulated by IRFs. Because these genes are involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and tumor suppression, IRFs are also involved in regulation of these processes in addition to their roles in immune regulation (17.Barnes B.J.

Two such sequence motifs, 5′-GGAAAGCGAAACC-3′ (ISRE) and 5′-CAAAAGCGAAACT-3′ (IRF-binding element, IRFE), have been identified in the IRF7 first intron and in its promoter, respectively (20.Lu R.

IRF7 has a wider DNA-binding specificity (GAAWNYGAAANY, W = A or T, Y = C or T) compared with IRF3 (GAAASSGAAANY, S = G or C) (21.Lin R. Genin P. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6342-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Studies on murine IFNA promoters showed that the core sequence GAAANN for IRF binding can be divided into four groups according to the identity of the NN: 1, the NC (N = G, C, A, or T) and ST bases inducible by both IRF3 and IRF7; 2, the NG and CA preferentially responsive to IRF3; 3, the GAAAAT repeats responding only to IRF7; and 4, the DA (D = T, A, or G) unresponsive to both factors (7.Civas A.

Biol. 2002; 316: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both the IRF7 ISRE and IRFE match the first group, which is inducible by both IRF3 and IRF7. The ISRE-containing genes are regulated by IRFs typically through the Jak-STAT pathway. In this pathway, type I or II IFN stimulation results in the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. The phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2, together with IRF9, which is constitutively expressed in most cell types, form the complex, interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) (23.Matsumoto M. Tanaka N. Harada H. Kimura T. Yokochi T. Kitagawa M. Schindler C. Taniguchi T. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This complex binds to the ISREs in the ISRE-containing genes and activates their transcription. A single copy of ISRE is sufficient for gene activation, but ISRE-containing genes are not inducible in mutant cell lines in which any Jak-STAT pathway component has been knocked out (10.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar, 24.Bandyopadhyay S.K. Leonard Jr., G.T. Bandyopadhyay T. Stark G.R. Sen G.C. J. Biol.

Expression of IRF7 is typically mediated by the IFN-triggered Jak-STAT pathway in which ISGF3 directly binds to the IRF7 ISRE (20.Lu R. Au W.-C. Yeow W.-S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Although virus infection or synthetic double-stranded RNA results in expression of type I IFNs, which induce expression of IFN-inducible genes, some of these IFN-inducible genes (such as ISG15/54/56) are also directly induced upon virus infection or by double-stranded RNA independent of the IFN-triggered Jak-STAT pathway (24.Bandyopadhyay S.K.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Other IFN-inducible genes such as ISG9–27 and ISG6–16, however, are only induced by IFNs but not by virus infection or double-stranded RNA (3.Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M.

Thus, it seems that virus infection and IFN trigger two distinct cellular pathways, which sometimes converge on the same cis-acting elements. The slight differences in the ISRE motifs in the promoters of these ISRE-containing genes confer their different specificity in inducibility by either IFN or virus through unknown mechanisms (3.Wathelet M.G.

IRF7 functions as either an activator or a repressor in regulation of some ISRE-containing genes. In addition to induction of type I IFN expression (33.Taniguchi T. Takaoka A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Immunol. 2002; 14: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), IRF7 also represses EBNA1 transcription in EBV type III latency (35.Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), activates Tap2 transcription via EBV LMP1 (15.Zhang L. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and induces LMP1 expression (16.Ning S.B. Hahn A.M. Huye L.E. Joseph P.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9359-9368Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although extensive studies have shown that IRF7 is a multifunctional protein with transcriptional activity that depends on C-terminal phosphorylation, regulation of the IRF7 promoter (IRF7p) is poorly understood. Previous data show that ISGF3 is a potent factor in the induction of IRF7 expression in mouse (25.Sato M. Hata N. Asagiri M. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) and human cells (20.Lu R. Au W.-C. Yeow W.-S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this study, in addition to induction by type I IFNs, we demonstrate that IRF7 transcription can be regulated by binding of both IRF7 and IRF3 proteins in the virus-activated factor (VAF) complex to the IRF7p ISRE and IRFE and that this regulation is independent of the IFN pathway. Plasmids—The IRF7 promoter construct p(–1123/+575)-Luc, which contains the wild type ISRE and IRFE motifs as well as its three mutants, IRFEm-Luc, (ISRE+IRFE)m-Luc, and ΔISRE-Luc, were gifts from Paul Pitha (20.Lu R.

ISREm-Luc and ΔIRFE-Luc were made by site-directed mutation (Stratagene) using p(–1123/+575)-Luc as template. The IFNβ promoter construct, pGL3/IFNβp-Luc, was described previously (36.Lin R.

Both pMTCB6+-Jak1DN and EGFP-C1 vector contain a neomycin resistance gene that allows transfected cells to be selected using G418. FLAG-IRF7DN, FLAG-IRF3, FLAG-IRF3DN, and FLAG-IRF3(5D) were constructed by subcloning corresponding PCR products into pCMV2-FLAG vector (Sigma), which was kindly provided by John Hiscott. Cell Lines and Establishment of Stable Transfectants—293 cells are derived from human kidney epithelial cells. HeLa cells are derived from cervical carcinoma. Mutant cell lines, U2A cells lacking functional IRF9, U4A cells lacking Jak1, and the parent cells 2fTGH (human fibroblasts) were gifts from George Stark (10.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

The DKO cell line used in this study is a mouse embryonic fibroblast line with targeted disruption of both the IRF1 and IRF2 genes (40.Matsuyama T. Kimura T. Kitagawa M. Pfeffer K. Kawakami T.

All the cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. 293 cells were transfected with an Effectene kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Cells lines stably expressing 1) Jak1-DN, 2) EGFP-C1, FLAG-IRF7DN, and FLAG-IRF3DN, and 3) Jak1-DN, FLAG-IRF7DN, and FLAG-IRF3DN were generated. EGFP-C1 empty vector cotransfected in 2) was for selection with G418. Expression of Jak1-DN was induced by adding ZnCl2 at a final concentration of 50 μm for 8 h before G418 was added. One day after transfection, cells were cultured in medium containing 800 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks. Single stable clones were screened and expression of FLAG-IRF7 and FLAG-IRF3 in some single clones was detected by Western blot using anti-FLAG (Sigma). Stably expressing cells were maintained in 400 μg/ml G418-containing medium. Reporter Assays—For luciferase assays, cells in 12-well plates were transfected with 0.2 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.1 μg β-galactosidase expression plasmid with the use of an Effectene kit. After 12 h, cells were infected with 200 HAU SeV for 24 h or IFNα2 for 12 h after transfection. Cell lysates were combined with Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega), and the relative light units were measured in an Autolumat LB953 (PE, Inc.). The activity of β-galactosidase was used as internal control. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected with 2 μg of expression plasmids with an Effectene kit. 42 h after transfection, cells were infected with 200 HAU/ml Cantell Sendai viruses for 6 h before harvest (3.Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/μl bovine serum albumin) with protease inhibitors. The whole cell lysates were used for EMSA, as described previously (36.Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34320-34327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) was added to reduce nonspecific binding at a final concentration of 62.5 μg/ml. Probes with 5′-GATC or 5′-GTAC adhesive ends were annealed and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP in Klenow reactions. For each binding reaction, about 40,000 cpm of probe were used. For supershift assays, cell lysates were incubated with 0.2 μg FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma), 2 μg of IRF3 antibody SL-12 (BD Biosciences), CBP antibody A-22, or p300 antibody N-15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) before probe was added. Protein·DNA complexes were separated on 5% 60:1 acrylamide/bis-acrylamide gels. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—HeLa cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 5 μg of expression plasmids or empty vector. Cells were infected with SeV for 6 h and then subjected to cross-linking by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% for 30 min at room temperature with slow rotation. Cross-linking was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm for 5 min. Chromatin was sheared to ∼300 bp by sonication. Immunoprecipitation, washing, and the recovery of bound DNA were performed following the protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology. After extraction and precipitation, DNA pellets were dissolved in 60 μl of H2O, and 15 μl of each were used for PCR. All PCR reactions were performed for 35 cycles with a high fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) at an annealing temperature of 60 °C. PCR products were run on 1.5% agarose gels. RT-PCR—Cells were infected with 200 HAU/ml of SeV or 500 units/ml IFNα2 (Sigma) for indicated time periods. RT was performed for 60 min in a volume of 20 μl with 1 μg of total RNA with an RT-PCR system kit (Promega). The cDNA products were diluted 5 times. PCR was run in the linear range (30 cycles) at an annealing temperature of 60 °C in a high fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). Primers for β-actin were 5′-GGCATCGTGATGGACTCCG-3′ and 5′-GCTGGAAGGTGGACAGCGA-3′. PCR products were run on 1.5% agarose gels. Virus Infection Induces Endogenous IRF7 mRNA—IRF7 possesses an ISRE and an IRFE in its promoter and first intron (20.Lu R. Au W.-C. Yeow W.-S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). IRF3 and IRF7 can potentially bind to these elements after activation by virus infection and therefore directly induce expression of IRF7 independently of the Jak-STAT pathway. To test this hypothesis, we first performed RT-PCR in SAN cells lacking type I IFN genes and in 293 cells stably transfected with a Jak1 kinase dominant negative construct (pMTCB6+/Jak1-DN). Total mRNAs were isolated for quantitative RT-PCR for detection of IRF7 expression (41.Lu R. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 24: 1411-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). SAN cells were infected with SeV for the indicated time periods (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1A, SeV infection increases IRF7 mRNA detectable after 6 h, and further increases can be detected up to 72 h. Because type II IFN (IFN γ) is produced by activated T-lymphocytes (T-cells) and natural killer cells (46.Roberts R.M. Liu L. Guo Q. Leaman D. Bixby J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 47.Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar), the time course data from the human glioblastoma SAN cells indicate that IRF7 can be induced by SeV infection independently of type I and II IFNs. Because the recently discovered IFNλ also induces an antiviral state and expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and works through the Jak-STAT pathway (48.Sheppard P. Kindsvogel W. Xu W.F. Henderson K. Schlutsmeyer S. Whitmore T.E. Kuestner R. Garrigues U. Birks C. Roraback J. Ostrander C. Dong D. Shin J. Presnell S. Fox B. Haldeman B. Cooper E. Taft D. Gilbert T. Grant F.J. Tackett M.

Shah N.K. Langer J.A. Sheikh F. Dickensheets H. Donnelly R.P. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar), we used a Jak1 kinase dead, dominant negative stably transfected 293 cell line (293-Jak1DN) to exclude the possibility that SeV induction of IRF7 involves IFNλ and/or the Jak1-STAT pathway. Analysis of RNA from SeV-infected 293-Jak1DN cells revealed a pattern of IRF-7 induction similar to that observed in SAN cells (Fig. 1B). That the Jak1DN blocked endogenous Jak1 activity was confirmed by examining the expression of the ISG56 gene, a target of Jak1 signaling (50.Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 3 and 4). Also, we performed promoter reporter assays in 293 cells, HeLa cells, and in several mutant cell lines, SAN (IFNα–/β–), U2A (IRF9–), U4A (Jak1–), and DKO (IRF1–/IRF2–). The results disclosed that IRF7 and IRF3 can activate a 1.6-kb IRF7 promoter construct, p(–1123/+575)-Luc which contains both the IRFE and ISRE, and SeV infection can increase the IRF7 promoter activity significantly in these cells (data not shown). Thus, because Jak1 is required for signaling pathways triggered by all IFNs including IFN α/β (type I), IFNγ (type II), and IFNλ (10.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar, 48.Sheppard P. Kindsvogel W. Xu W.F. Henderson K. Schlutsmeyer S. Whitmore T.E. Kuestner R. Garrigues U. Birks C.

Immunol. 2003; 4: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar), the data from the mutant cell line SAN and Jak1DN cells indicate that IRF7 can be induced by SeV infection independently of all types of IFNs. IRF7 and IRF3 Are Required for SeV Infection-induced IRF7 Expression—Because SeV infection induced IRF7 expression independently of IFNs, we next asked whether IRF7 and IRF3 are important for this induction. To answer this question we generated 293 stable cell lines expressing 1) dominant negative IRF7 (IRF7DN) and IRF3 (IRF3DN) (51.Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) or 2) IRF7DN, IRF3DN, and Jak1-DN. We infected these cells, the 293-Jak1DN cells, and wild type 293 cells with SeV and analyzed IRF-7 mRNA by RT-PCR. SeV infection of 293-Jak1DN cells induced substantial amounts of IRF7 mRNA as expected (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 3). However, SeV infection did not induce significant IRF7 expression in the cells expressing the IRF3DN, IRF7DN, and Jak1DN mutants (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate that the induction of IRF7 by SeV requires IRF3 and IRF7 but does not require Jak1. In contras"

L. P., Giger, W., Guenther, K., and Kohler, H.-P. E. (2005) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 71, 1123–1129). Three metabolites of 4-(1-methyloctyl)-phenol were isolated in mg quantities from cultures of strain Bayram supplemented with the growth substrate isomer 4-(1-ethyl-1,4-dimethyl-pentyl)-phenol. They were unequivocally identified as 4-hydroxy-4-(1-methyl-octyl)-cyclohexa-2,5-dienone, 4-hydroxy-4-(1-methyl-octyl)-cyclohex-2-enone, and 2-(1-methyl-octyl)-benzene-1,4-diol by high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Furthermore, two metabolites originating from 4-n-nonylphenol were identified as 4-hydroxy-4-nonyl-cyclohexa-2,5-dienone and 4-hydroxy-4-nonyl-cyclohex-2-enone by high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We conclude that nonylphenols were initially hydroxylated at the ipso-position forming 4-alkyl-4-hydroxy-cyclohexa-2,5-dienones. Dienones originating from growth substrate nonylphenol isomers underwent a rearrangement that involved a 1,2-C,O shift of the alkyl moiety as a cation to the oxygen atom of the geminal hydroxy group yielding 4-alkoxyphenols, from which the alkyl moieties can be easily detached as alcohols by known mechanisms. Dienones originating from nongrowth substrates did not undergo such a rearrangement because the missing alkyl substituents at the α-carbon atom prevented stabilization of the putative α-carbocation. Instead they accumulated and subsequently underwent side reactions, such as 1,2-C,C shifts and dihydrogenations. The ipso-hydroxylation and the proposed 1,2-C,O shift constitute key steps in a novel pathway that enables bacteria to detach α-branched alkyl moieties of alkylphenols for utilization of the aromatic part as a carbon and energy source. Several nonylphenol isomers with α-quaternary carbon atoms serve as growth substrates for Sphingomonas xenophaga Bayram, whereas isomers containing hydrogen atoms at the α-carbon do not (Gabriel, F.

Microbiol. 2001; 51: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were isolated for their ability to grow with 4-nonylphenols as sole carbon and energy source. Sphingomonads, a group of Gram-negative bacteria recognized as a discrete genus for approximately 15 years, are well known for their extraordinary metabolic capabilities to degrade many otherwise recalcitrant chemicals. They are widely distributed in nature and found in various soils and aqueous environments, and representatives have been isolated from deep subsurface sediments (15Laskin A.I. White D.C. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 23: 231Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).The three nonylphenol metabolizing strains release the nonyl side chains of the growth substrate isomers as C9 alcohols with unchanged carbon connectivity into the culture fluids (Fig. 1A) and most likely do not further metabolize these alcohols (10Gabriel F.L.P.

However, these bacteria seem to be able to completely mineralize the aromatic moiety of those nonylphenol isomers that serve as growth substrates (10Gabriel F.L.P. Giger W. Guenther K. Kohler H-P.E.

However, the latter isomers were cometabolically transformed in experiments in which growth isomers were present. Furthermore, differential degradation was clearly evident because isomers with a more highly branched alkyl side chain were degraded much faster than those with less complex branching (10Gabriel F.L.P.

The resulting esters are easily cleaved by a hydrolytic mechanism, whereby the original alkyl moiety leaves as an alkanoic acid (Fig. 1B). Alkylphenols are also degraded through meta-fission pathways in which the aromatic ring is opened by dioxygenases before the meta-cleavage product is hydrolyzed to 2-hydroxypent-2,4-dienoic acid and an alkanoic acid derived from the original alkyl side chain and the ring anchor carbon (20Kohler H-P.E. van der Maarel M.J.E.C.

However, a pathway for the metabolism of alkylphenols through detachment of the alkyl substituent as an alcohol (Fig. 1A) has not yet been reported.Although never shown for the detachment of complex alkyl groups, ipso-substitution represents a general method by which bacteria and rat liver microsomes oxidatively detach substituents, such as halogen and nitro groups in ortho- or para-substituted phenols (23Ohe T.

The substituent is then eliminated either as an anion or as a cation; depending on whether the ring-substituent bond electrons in the cyclohexadienone derivative remain with the substituent or with the carbon ring, p-benzoquinone or hydroquinone is formed (23Ohe T. Mashino T. Hirobe M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1997; 25: 116-122PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, D and E, respectively). This article describes the bacterial metabolism of several 4-nonylphenol isomers. Intermediates identified by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry point to a novel pathway based on ipso-hydroxylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES4-Nonylphenol Isomers—The acronyms for the various 4-nonylphenol isomers (Fig. 2) used in this study are based on the systematic numbering system proposed by Guenther and co-workers. 1K. Guenther, E. Kleist, and B. Thiele, manuscript in preparation. The source and the purity of the nonylphenol isomers utilized in this study has been described elsewhere (10Gabriel F.L.P. Giger W.

The atom numbering is according to that used for the assignments of chemical shifts.

Giger W. Guenther K. Kohler H-P.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because nonylphenols are poorly soluble in aqueous medium, it was necessary to work up a whole culture vial for each time point measured. To study cometabolic degradation, several culture vials containing each 3 ml of minimal medium and a mixture of 4-NP2 (or 4-NP1) 2The abbreviations used are: NP, nonylphenol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TIS, turbo ion spray; MS, mass spectrometry; [M – H]–, quasimolecular ion; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy. and 4-NP112 (3 mg each) were inoculated and incubated for varying periods of time. Appropriate controls were included for all experiments. Inoculation was performed with 100 μl of a shaking culture of S. xenophaga Bayram, produced by maintaining the bacterium on minimal medium (3 ml) with 3 mg of technical nonylphenol or 4-NP112 as the sole carbon source.Extraction of Nonylphenols and Metabolites from the Culture Vials— For work up, the frozen samples were thawed, and nonylphenols contained in the liquid cultures and sticking on the wall of the culture vials were extracted twice with 2 and 66 ml (preparative scale), respectively, of CH2Cl2. Except for the experiment on the preparative scale, the cultures were acidified with 300 μl of 1 n HCl, prior to the extraction.Analytical and Preparative HPLC—Dried culture extracts were analyzed as described elsewhere (detection wavelength of 277 nm) (10Gabriel F.L.P. Giger W. Guenther K. Kohler H-P.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To isolate metabolites, the extracts were separated by preparative reverse phase chromatography using a C18 column (VP 250/21 Nucleosil 7 C18, Macherey-Nagel) and isocratic elution conditions (CH3CN/H2O 7:3, 10 ml/min).Mass Spectrometry—To detect C9 alcohols derived from alkyl chains of nonylphenols, the CH2Cl2 extracts of the cultures were analyzed by gas chromatography-electron impact-MS, as described elsewhere (10Gabriel F.L.P. Giger W. Guenther K. Kohler H-P.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). HPLC-TIS-MS and -MS/MS were used in the negative mode to get structural information about the UV active nonylphenol metabolites produced by the cometabolic transformation of 4-NP2 and of 4-NP1 (experiments with 3 mg of substrate). For injection, the samples were taken up in appropriate volumes of isopropanol. We used an HPLC system (Hewlett Packard 1100 series) that was connected to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer through a Turbo Ion Spray interface (API 4000 liquid chromatography-MS/MS system; Applied Biosystems). The Analyst 1.3 software (Applied Biosystems, MDS Sciex) was utilized. The HPLC system was composed of an autosampler, a binary high pressure gradient pump, and a UV-visible detector and was equipped with a column oven and an on-line Vacuum degasser (DG4; Henggeler Analytic Instruments, Riehen, Switzerland). The eluents were prepared with HPLC grade CH3OH (Multisolvent; Scharlau, Barcelona, Spain) and ultrapure H2O (Milli-Q gradient A10; Switzerland Millipore AG, Volketswil). The HPLC conditions were identical to those for analytical HPLC-UV, except that the solvents were alkalinized with 1 μl of concentrated NH3/100 ml to get higher signal intensities. The oven was set at 23 °C, and the eluate was monitored at 230 nm. For the Turbo Ion Spray ionization, nitrogen was used as curtain, nebulizer, and desolvation gas. The source temperature was set at 400 °C, and the ion spray voltage was set at –4500 V. Intensive signals were produced in MS spectra with a declustering potential of –30 V and an entrance potential of –12 V. Full scan spectra were acquired in the negative mode, scanning from 20 to 600 m/z. To obtain MS/MS spectra, a declustering potential of –30 to –20 V and an entrance potential of –12 to –10 V were used, depending on the time period window. Nitrogen was used as the collision gas, and a collision energy of –30 eV was selected. Full scan MS/MS spectra were acquired scanning from 20 to (i + 5) m/z, i being the m/z value of the mother ion. In the MS spectra, the [M – H]– peaks were identified and distinguished from cluster signals by referring to the unique [(M)2 – H]– peaks.Nuclear Magnetic Resonance—The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 400.13 (100.61) MHz on a Bruker Avance-400 NMR spectrometer. The one-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR spectra and the 1H,1H and 1H,13C two-dimensional correlation experiments were performed using a 5-mm broadband inverse probe with z-gradient (100% gradient strength of 10 G cm–1) and 90° pulse lengths of 6.5 μs (1H) and 11.0 μs (13C). The chemical shifts were referenced internally using the resonance signals of CHD2CN at 1.93 (1H) and of CD3CN at 1.3 (13C) ppm. The gradient-selected HSQC (HMBC) (28Schleucher J. Schwendinger M.

Guenther K. Kohler H-P.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) Hz, with gradient strengths of 80:20.1:11:–5 (50:30:40.1), applying a carbon decoupling field of 3.2 kHz for the HSQC experiments (globally optimized alternating phase rectangular pulses decoupling) (30Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar). The HSQC-TOCSY (31Palmer A.G. Cavanagh J. Wright P.E. Rance M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 151-170Google Scholar) spectra were recorded applying mixing times of 100 or 20 ms, respectively. To record the NMR spectra, 42.0 mg of 4-NP2, 9.1 mg of 2-(1-methyl-octyl)-benzene-1,4-diol (metabolite 2), and 22.0 mg of a mixture of 4-hydroxy-4-(1-methyl-octyl)-cylohexa-2,5-dienone (metabolite 1) and 4-hydroxy-4-(1-methyl-octyl)-cyclohex-2-enone (metabolite 3) were dissolved in CD3CN (final volume, 600 μl), respectively.RESULTSCometabolic Transformation of 4-NP2—A degradation experiment with the growth substrate 4-NP112 (70% transformation) showed that within 9 days of incubation, 39% of the nongrowth substrate 4-NP2 was cometabolically transformed. Thereafter, between days 9 and 24 degradation slowed down to only 12 and 15% of the initial amounts of 4-NP2 and 4-NP112, respectively. Substantial amounts of 3,6-dimethyl-heptan-3-ol (N112OH), the C9 alcohol derived from the alkyl chain of 4-NP112, were detected by gas chromatography-MS in the CH2Cl2 extracts of cultures that were incubated for 5 and 9 days, respectively. In contrast, no C9 alcohol derived from 4-NP2 was detectable. However, four metabolites, each with a characteristic UV spectrum, were found by HPLC-UV (Table I). The most polar compound, metabolite 2 (retention time, 11.8 min), had a UV absorption maximum at a higher wavelength (291 nm) than that of nonylphenol isomers (∼277 nm; Table I). The metabolites 1 and 3, eluting at 15.0 and 15.5 min, were not completely separable and had absorption maxima at 232 and 221 nm, respectively. Metabolite 4 (retention time, 24.9 min), which has not yet been identified, eluted between 4-NP112 (retention time, 23.4 min) and 4-NP2 (retention time, 27.0 min). Isolation of Metabolites 1, 2, and 3—To isolate the UV active metabolites in sufficient amounts for structure determination, a degradation experiment with 100 mg of both 4-NP2 and 4-NP112 in 100 ml of minimal medium was carried out. Preparative HPLC of the CH2Cl2 extract of a culture incubated for 9 days yielded 9.2 mg of metabolite 2 (8.4 mol-%), 22.3 mg of a mixture of metabolite 1 (9.1%) and metabolite 3 (11.2%) (metabolite 1 and metabolite 3 were collected in the same fraction; their relative amounts were determined by comparing relative signal intensities in the 1H NMR spectra), and 2.2 mg of a fraction containing mainly metabolite 4.Table IHPLC-UV, -TIS-MS, and -TIS-MS/MS analysis of nonylphenols and UV active metabolitesView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)a The two TIS-MS signals that are relevant for the determination of the molecular weight of the analytes are presented (for clarity, TIS-MS signals of clusters are not shown).

Open table in a new tab TIS-MS/MS Spectra of Nonylphenol Isomers—For the correct interpretation of the TIS-MS/MS spectra of the four metabolites, it was necessary to carefully analyze the spectra of the 4-nonylphenol isomers that served as growth and nongrowth substrates. Under MS/MS conditions, the isomers 4-NP112, 4-NP2, and 4-NP1 produced prominent signals at m/z 219 for the quasimolecular ions ([M – H]–) with relative intensities of 100, 100, and 90%, respectively. The three nonylphenols showed characteristic spectra that were dominated by signals corresponding to the homolytic cleavage of the benzylic substituents and the subsequent loss of hydrogen atoms or alkyl groups in β-position, thereby yielding nonradical, α,β-unsaturated anions, for which usually more intensive signals were observed (Table I).NMR Analysis of 4-NP2—The 1H and 13C chemical shifts of the substrate 4-NP2 and metabolites 1, 2, and 3 were assigned by one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments (Table II). The following analysis of the NMR data of 4-NP2 was a prerequisite for the correct elucidation of the structures of the 4-NP2-derived metabolites. The 1H,13C-HMBC correlations used for the chemical shift assignments are shown in Table III, together with the resolved 1H,1H coupling constants. By analyzing the 1H,13C-HSQC and -HMBC spectra (correlations over one and 2–3 H–C bonds, respectively), the framework comprising the carbons and protons at positions 1–8 and 15 could be easily reconstituted in all instances. On the other hand, the interpretation and adequate assignment were not always straightforward for the positions 9–14. Because of the overlapping of signals situated ∼1.25 ppm (1H) and 30 ppm (13C), the expected correlation signals were sometimes hidden beyond dominant cross-peaks; also, the differences in chemical shifts of successive atoms in the chain were at times so small that not enough resolution was achieved for a confident assignment of all peaks. In the case of 4-NP2, the assignment of the carbon atoms at positions 10–12 to the 13C resonances at 30.0, 30.4, and 32.6 ppm remained unclear. We therefore performed HSQC-TOCSY experiments (31Palmer A.G. Cavanagh J. Wright P.E. Rance M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 151-170Google Scholar), using mixing times of 20 and 100 ms. Fig. 3 shows expanded regions with the correlation signals between the methyl protons H-14 of 4-NP2 and the neighboring carbon atoms for both mixing times. With the long period, the magnetization was transferred to the whole carbon skeleton (C-(9–14); Fig. 3b). In contrast, the short mixing allowed a transfer only to the carbons at 14.4 (C-14), 23.4 (C-13), 32.6 ppm (C-12), and 30.0 ppm, the latter correlation being rather weak. The 13C signal at 30.0 ppm could thus be assigned to C-11. The 13C chemical shifts we determined for the carbon atoms of the alkyl chain corresponded well to those evaluated by a “chemical shift increment calculation” (32Pretsch E. Clerc T. Seibl J. Simon W. Strukturaufklaerung Organischer Verbindungen mit Spektroskopischen Methoden. 3rd Ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Google Scholar) (30.6, 30.0, 32.5, 23.1, and 14.0 ppm for C-10 through C-14).Table II1H and 13C chemical shifts of 4-NP2, 1, 2, and 3PositionaFor atom numbers, see Fig. 2.δ1H13CbThe compounds 1 and 3 were analyzed as a mixture.

Analysis of the HPLC mass spectrometry data gave further evidence for the proposed structure because the [(M)2 – H]– signal at m/z 471.9 (Table I) showed that metabolite 2 contained an additional oxygen atom when compared with nonylphenol. When the quasimolecular ion [M – H]– was submitted to MS/MS conditions (Table I), the fragments resulting from the cleavage of the benzylic bonds proved the presence of a 1-methyl-octyl substituent, suggesting that metabolite 2 was derived from 4-NP2 and was identical with 2-(1-methyl-octyl)-benzene-1,4-diol (Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W2041073990,"Abstract Human cytochrome P450 (P450) 2A6 catalyzes 7-hydroxylation of coumarin, and the reaction rate is enhanced by cytochrome b5 (b5). 7-Alkoxycoumarins were O-dealkylated and also hydroxylated at the 3-position. Binding of coumarin and 7-hydroxycoumarin to ferric and ferrous P450 2A6 are fast reactions (kon ∼ 106 m–1 s–1), and the koff rates range from 5.7 to 36 s–1 (at 23 °C). Reduction of ferric P450 2A6 is rapid (7.5 s–1) but only in the presence of coumarin. The reaction of the ferrous P450 2A6 substrate complex with O2 is rapid (k ≥ 106 m–1 s–1), and the putative Fe2+ ·O2 complex decayed at a rate of ∼0.3 s–1 at 23 °C. Some 7-hydroxycoumarin was formed during the oxidation of the ferrous enzyme under these conditions, and the yield was enhanced by b5. Kinetic analyses showed that ∼1/3 of the reduced b5 was rapidly oxidized in the presence of the Fe2+·O2 complex, implying some electron transfer. High intrinsic and competitive and non-competitive intermolecular kinetic deuterium isotope effects (values 6–10) were measured for O-dealkylation of 7-alkoxycoumarins, indicating the effect of C–H bond strength on rates of product formation. These results support a scheme with many rapid reaction steps, including electron transfers, substrate binding and release at multiple stages, and rapid product release even though the substrate is tightly bound in a small active site. The inherent difficulty of chemistry of substrate oxidation and the lack of proclivity toward a linear pathway leading to product formation explain the inefficiency of the enzyme relative to highly efficient bacterial P450s."

The thiol-polyamine conjugate trypanothione (N1,N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine) (1Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) and the flavoenzyme trypanothione reductase (TR) 1The abbreviations used are: TR, trypanothione reductase; ROOH, hydroperoxide; GPX, glutathione peroxidase; PhGPX, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase; Px, glutathione peroxidase-type tryparedoxin peroxidase (Cys homologue of glutathione peroxidase); Pex, peroxin; BiP, endoplasmic reticulum chaperon (binding protein). replace the nearly ubiquitous glutathione/glutathione reductase system. A direct linkage between glutathione and spermidine metabolism was first discovered in Escherichia coli (2Tabor H. Tabor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2648-2654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During stationary phase, all of the cellular spermidine and a large part of glutathione occur as mono(glutathionyl)-spermidine whereby the bacterium does not form trypanothione. The dithiol trypanothione is the donor of reducing equivalents for the reduction of thioredoxin (3Schmidt H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol.

Trypanosomes are exposed to various reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, and products of the host myeloperoxidase system. However, their ability to cope with oxidative stress is relatively weak. Although the parasites possess superoxide dismutase, they lack catalase and selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidases, the main hydroperoxide-metabolizing enzymes in the mammalian host. In trypanosomatids, three classes of peroxidases, 2 Cys-peroxiredoxins (9Flohé L. Steinert P. Hecht H.J. Hofmann B.

The enzymatic cascades for the 2 Cys-peroxiredoxins and the glutathione peroxidase-type peroxidases are identical. With NADPH as the final electron donor, the reducing equivalents flow via trypanothione onto tryparedoxin and finally the peroxidase, which then catalyzes the reduction of the hydroperoxide (9Flohé L.

Biochem. 1997; 248: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This means that the 2 Cys-peroxiredoxins and the glutathione peroxidase-type enzymes act as trypanothione-dependent tryparedoxin peroxidases. In T. cruzi, the genes of two cysteine homologues of glutathione peroxidases have been cloned and overexpressed. One of the enzymes has been described as T. cruzi glutathione peroxidase I, but the reported activities with glutathione were extremely low (12Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Kelly J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Later the enzyme was also shown to use the trypanothione/tryparedoxin couple as an electron source (13Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Taylor M.C. Bromley E.V. Miles M.A. Kelly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17062-17071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The T. cruzi peroxidase catalyzes the reduction of different hydrophobic substrates, especially of phospholipid hydroperoxides such as phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide but not of hydrogen peroxide. In African trypanosomes, a genomic locus encodes three nearly identical glutathione peroxidase-type enzymes (14Hillebrand H. Schmidt A. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6809-6815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). RNA interference approaches revealed that the enzyme(s) is essential for the viability of bloodstream T. brucei (17Wilkinson S.R. Horn D. Prathalingam S.R. Kelly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31640-31646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although T. cruzi glutathione peroxidase I and the T. brucei peroxidases share 72% of all residues, they show significant differences in their cellular localization as well as their kinetic properties as will be outlined here. Four types of selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidases have been characterized in mammals, the cytosolic cGPX (GPX I), also called classical or cellular glutathione peroxidase, the gastrointestinal GI-GPX (GPX II), the extracellular pGPX (GPX III) found in human plasma, and the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PhGPX) (GPX IV). The cytosolic glutathione peroxidase uses glutathione as reducing substrate, whereas the extracellular enzyme accepts thioredoxin and glutaredoxin and PhGPX can be reduced by a variety of protein thiols (18Brigelius-Flohé R. Flohé L. Biofactors. 2003; 17: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Björnstedt M. Xue J. Huang W. Akesson B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29382-29384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidases have so far only been found in vertebrates and a GPX IV type enzyme in the helminth Schistosoma mansoni (20Williams D.L. Pierce R.J. Cookson E. Capron A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 52: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, genes encoding cysteine homologues such as the T. cruzi and T. brucei peroxidases are widely distributed in nature. Only a few of these enzymes have been functionally characterized. All of them have much lower peroxidase activities than the mammalian seleno-enzymes (14Hillebrand H. Schmidt A. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6809-6815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Sztajer H. Gamain B. Aumann K.D. Slomianny C. Becker K. Brigelius-Flohé R. Flohé L. J. Biol.

A cysteine homologue from the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum reduces H2O2 but not at all phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide and proved to be much more efficient with thioredoxin than with glutathione as the electron source (21Sztajer H. Gamain B. Aumann K.D. Slomianny C. Becker K. Brigelius-Flohé R. Flohé L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7397-7403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). An enzyme from the nematode Brugia pahangi reduces linoleic acid hydroperoxide and phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide but not H2O2 with glutathione as the reducing substrate. It is a secreted glycoprotein, and the natural electron source is not known (22Tang L. Gounaris K. Griffiths C. Selkirk M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18313-18318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here we will report on the substrate specificity and subcellular occurrence of the T. brucei glutathione peroxidase-type enzymes. African trypanosomes multiply as bloodstream parasites in the mammalian host and as procyclic parasites in the tsetse fly. Cell fractionation studies revealed the proteins in the cytosol and the mitochondrion of both cell types. No peroxidase was detectable in glycosomes, although one protein sequence contains a putative glycosomal/peroxisomal targeting signal. Hydrogen peroxide, thymine hydroperoxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide are probable physiological substrates of the T. brucei peroxidase. The results of RNA interference experiments demonstrated that the enzyme is also essential for procyclic in addition to bloodstream T. brucei. Materials—The recombinant glutathione peroxidase-type T. brucei tryparedoxin peroxidase (14Hillebrand H. Schmidt A. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol.

Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the recombinant His-tagged T. brucei peroxidase III (14Hillebrand H. Schmidt A. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol.

The TR antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography on recombinant T. cruzi TR. 2S. Meiering and R. L. Krauth-Siegel, unpublished work. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the T. brucei homologue of the endoplasmic reticulum matrix protein BiP were a kind gift of Dr. James Bangs, Madison, WI. Other polyclonal rabbit antibodies used in this study were directed against the T. brucei glycosomal membrane protein Pex11 (26Lorenz P. Maier A.G. Baumgart E. Erdmann R. Clayton C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3542-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and against T. cruzi lipoamide dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial matrix enzyme (27Schöneck R. Billaut-Mulot O. Numrich P. Ouaissi M.A. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide and a rat sperm preparation with phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PhGPX) were kindly provided by Dr. Regina Brigelius-Flohé, German Institute of Human Nutrition, Potsdam, Germany. Thymine hydroperoxide was synthesized according to a published procedure (28Hahn B.S. Wang S.Y. J. Org. Chem. 1976; 41: 567-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Trypanothione disulfide was purchased from Bachem, H2O2 was from Merck. t-Butyl hydroperoxide, linoleic acid, and soybean lipoxygenase were from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest available purity. Preparation of Recombinant Tag-free T. brucei Peroxidase III— Stored purified His6-Px III as well as the run-through of the nickel column used for purification showed significant amounts of a truncated tag-free protein species with identical specific activity but a 2-kDa lower molecular mass. Edman degradation of the protein yielded (K)K-MSAA as the N-terminal sequence (14Hillebrand H. Schmidt A. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6809-6815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The tag-free Px III was purified from the flow-through of the metal chelator column. Ammonium sulfate was added at 40% saturation. After centrifugation the pellet was discarded, and the saturation in the supernatant was raised to 65%. After centrifugation, the precipitate was dissolved in 100 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (Schleicher & Schuell), and loaded onto a Superdex 75 HiLoad 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences). Approximately 80 mg of total protein in 2 ml of buffer was applied onto the column equilibrated in 100 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6. The fast protein liquid chromatography was run at room temperature at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min, and 2-ml fractions were collected. The peroxidase-containing fractions were pooled. The protein solution was concentrated using an Amicon ultra 10000 MWCO concentrator (Millipore) to about 1 mg/ml and stored at 4 °C. The purity was more than 90%. Synthesis of Linoleic Acid Hydroperoxide—Linoleic acid hydroperoxide was synthesized enzymatically by modification of a published protocol (29Gibian M.J. Vandenberg P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Linoleic acid (16 μmol) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of ethanol. 0.1 m sodium borate buffer, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 10, was added to give a total volume of 32 ml and a final concentration of 240 μm linoleic acid. 42 μg of soybean lipoxygenase was added, and hydroperoxide formation was monitored at 235 nm (ϵ = 25 mm–1 cm–1). After 20 min of incubation at 4 °C, the lipoxygenase was removed by centrifugation through Amicon ultra 10000 MWCO concentrators (Millipore). The linoleic acid hydroperoxide was freed from the borate buffer by ether extraction and dried in an argon stream. The pellet was re-dissolved in 100% ethanol to a final concentration of 3 mm, and the solution was stored at 4 °C for up to 7 days. Peroxidase Standard Assay—The trypanothione/tryparedoxin-dependent peroxidase activity of Px III was followed at 25 °C in a total volume of 150 μl of 0.1 m Tris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, containing 240 μm NADPH, 100 μm trypanothione disulfide, 150 milliunits of TR, 10 μm tryparedoxin, and 0.05 μm peroxidase in the case of thymine hydroperoxide and 0.11 μm enzyme when H2O2 or linoleic acid hydroperoxide and 0.5 μm peroxidase when t-butyl hydroperoxide or phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide were studied as substrates. The reaction was started by adding 100 μm hydroperoxide substrate, and NADPH consumption was followed at 340 nm. The total concentration of hydroperoxide in the assay was determined by allowing the reaction to run to completion. Reduction of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide by rat PhGPX was measured as the control. Kinetic Analysis of Different Hydroperoxide Substrates—The assays contained in a total volume of 150 μlof0.1 m Tris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, 240 μm NADPH, 100 μm trypanothione disulfide, 150 milliunits of TR, 1–10 μm tryparedoxin, and 0.4 or 1.5 μm peroxidase when thymine hydroperoxide and linoleic acid hydroperoxide were studied as the substrate, respectively. The reaction was started by adding 50 μm hydroperoxide. Concentration dependence of the initial velocities was obtained by analyzing the time progression curve of NADPH consumption in a Beckman DU65 spectrophotometer with data acquisition every 1.5 s. The data were analyzed using the integrated Dalziel equation for a two-substrate enzyme reaction (30Dalziel K. Acta Chem. Scand. 1957; 11: 1706-1723Crossref Google Scholar, 31Forstrom J.W.

Chem. 2003; 278: 6809-6815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cultivation of Bloodstream and Procyclic T. brucei—For all experiments described here, culture-adapted bloodstream and procyclic T. brucei of cell line 449 were used. The cells are descendents of strain Lister 427 (32Cunningham M.P. Vickerman K. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1962; 56: 48-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that were stably transfected with pHD449 encoding the tetracycline repressor (33Biebinger S. Wirtz L.E. Lorenz P. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Bloodstream T. brucei were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in HMI-9 medium supplemented with 1.5 mm cysteine, 0.0014% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (v/v), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.2 μg/ml phleomycin to select for cells containing the tet repressor. Procyclic T. brucei were grown in MEM-Pros medium (Biochrom) supplemented with 7.5 μg/ml hemin, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (v/v), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.5 μg/ml phleomycin at 27 °C. Quantification of the Peroxidase in Bloodstream and Procyclic T. brucei—2 × 106 exponential-phase procyclic and bloodstream trypanosomes were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g. The cell pellets were mixed with 20 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% (v/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mm dithioerythritol, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and directly loaded onto a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. 7, 14, 28, and 56 ng of tag-free Px III was applied onto the same gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a Hybond™-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by wet electroblotting and probed with the polyclonal rabbit antiserum against the recombinant peroxidase (dilution 1: 2000). Anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1:20,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) served as secondary antibody. The immune complex was visualized by the SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The intensity of the protein bands was quantified by the program Gel Pro Analyzer 3.1 as absolute integrated optical density. Subcellular Localization of the Peroxidase in Procyclic and Bloodstream T. brucei—A sucrose gradient was prepared following a modified protocol of Opperdoes et al. (34Opperdoes F.R. Baudhuin P. Coppens I. De Roe C. Edwards S.W. Weijers P.J. Misset O. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). 1 × 1010 parasites were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g and 4 °C. The cell pellet was washed with TEDS buffer (25 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.8), resuspended in TEDS, 15% glycerol, and frozen at –80 °C. The cells were thawed at room temperature and washed in TEDS, a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science) dissolved in 2–3 ml TEDS was added, and the cells were manually broken with silicon carbide (Merck). The silicon carbide was removed by centrifugation at 100 × g, and the supernatant was loaded on top of a 39-ml semi-continuous 30–60% sucrose gradient, with a 68% sucrose cushion and 30% sucrose as the top concentration. Separation of the different cell compartments was achieved by centrifugation at 170,000 × g and 4 °C in a vertical rotor (Beckman VTi50) for 1 h in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman). 700-μl fractions were collected from the bottom of the centrifuge tube, and the protein concentration in each fraction was determined using the bicinchoninic acid kit (Pierce). To 250 μl of each fraction trichloroacetic acid and deoxycholate were added at 20% (w/v) and 0.4% (w/v) concentrations, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. After a 15-min centrifugation at 13,000 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge 5810R), the protein pellet was washed with 100% acetone, dissolved in 50 or 25 μlof1× Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 2 min. For the bloodstream cells 8 μl of the 5 times-concentrated gradient fractions were applied on 10 or 15% SDS gels. In the case of the procyclic parasites, 20-μl aliquots of the 10 times-concentrated gradient fractions were analyzed. Western blots were performed as described above with the polyclonal rabbit antiserum against the recombinant peroxidase (dilution 1:2000). To distinguish the different cell compartments, the blots were developed with antibodies directed against the marker proteins Pex11 (1:1000), lipoamide dehydrogenase (1:1000), BiP (1:2000), and TR (1:500). Anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1: 20,000, Santa Cruz) served as secondary antibody. RNA Interference Constructs and Transfection—A 452-bp fragment of the peroxidase III-coding region was amplified twice from genomic DNA of procyclic T. brucei strain AnTaT 1.1. Px-s (5′-GCA ACA TAA GCT TCA ATC TTT GAC TTT GAG GTG C-3′, the HindIII restriction site is given in italics) and Px-R-s-II (5′-GCA ACA TGT TAA CCA ATC TTT GAC TTT GAG GTG C-3′, HpaI site), respectively, served as forward primers. Px-as (5′-CAG AAT TCT GCA GCT CAA TAT CCT TCA CAG AGG-3′, overlapping EcoRI and PstI sites are given in italics) was used as the reverse primer in both polymerase chain reactions. The fragments were cloned into the HindIII/PstI and EcoRI/HpaI restriction sites, 5′ and 3′ of the stuffer segment in a vector derived from pSP72 (35Shi H. Djikeng A. Mark T. Wirtz E. Tschudi C. Ullu E. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The two gene copies together with the stuffer sequence were then ligated as HindIII/HpaI-digested cassette into the tetracycline-inducible vector pHD678 containing a hygromycin resistance gene (33Biebinger S. Wirtz L.E. Lorenz P. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The construct pHD678px targets the transcripts of the three nearly identical peroxidase genes (14Hillebrand H. Schmidt A. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6809-6815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). 107 Procyclic and bloodstream T. brucei of strain 449 were transfected by electroporation with 10 and 30 μg, respectively, of the NotI-linearized plasmid DNA and selected for hygromycin resistance (50 μg/ml) as described by Wang et al. (36Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Procyclic and bloodstream cells were harvested at a maximum density of 5 × 106 and 1 × 106 cells/ml, respectively. Bloodstream transfectants were seeded in 25 ml of HMI-9 medium containing 0.2 μg/ml phleomycin, and 1-ml aliquots were placed in a 24-well microtiter plate. After incubation overnight, 1 ml of fresh medium containing 0.2 μg/ml phleomycin and 10 μg/ml hygromycin were added to each well. Transfected procyclic T. brucei were seeded in 5 ml of MEM-Pros medium with 0.5 μg/ml phleomycin and allowed to grow overnight. After adding another 5 ml of fresh medium containing 0.5 μg/ml phleomycin and 100 μg/ml hygromycin, the cells were again incubated overnight. The culture was then diluted with conditioned medium containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin and subjected to serial dilutions into 6 wells of about 1 × 106, 3 × 105, 1 × 104, and 5 × 103 cells/ml. Bloodstream and procyclic cells were grown for 2 weeks before clones were harvested. Bloodstream clones were cultivated in the presence of 0.2 μg/ml phleomycin and 5 μg/ml hygromycin, the procyclic clones in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml phleomycin and 50 μg/ml hygromycin. Growth Phenotypes—To follow cell growth under continuous cultivation, 2 × 105 bloodstream trypanosomes per ml transformed with pHD678px were mixed with 0.5 μg/ml tetracycline and grown for 72 h. To determine the growth behavior upon cultivation in 24 h cycles, 1 × 105 bloodstream cells/ml were induced with 1 μg/ml tetracycline, and every 24 h the cultures were diluted with the tetracycline-containing medium to 1 × 105 cells/ml as required. In transfected procyclic parasites, RNA interference was induced by adding 1 μg/ml tetracycline at a cell density of 4 × 105 cells/ml for continuous cultivation and at 1 × 106 cells/ml for the cultivation in 24-h cycles. The cells were counted in a Neubauer chamber. For comparison, wild type cells of strain 449 were grown in the absence of tetracycline, and cells of strain 449 transfected with the empty plasmid pHD678 were grown with and without tetracycline. Preparation of T. brucei Total RNA and Northern Blot Analysis— Total RNA from tetracycline-induced and non-induced T. brucei cells of procyclic and bloodstream strains 449 (5 × 108–1 × 109 cells) was prepared with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 1.8% formaldehyde, blotted onto a Hybond™-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with the digoxigenin-labeled peroxidase gene. The luminescence probe was obtained by polymerase chain reaction with the Px-s and Px-as primers (see above) and pHD678px as template. Tubulin served as a loading control. The luminescence probe was amplified from the pHD887 plasmid template with primers β-"
https://openalex.org/W2143355874,"Unlike humans and yeast, Plasmodium falciparum, the agent of the most severe form of human malaria, utilizes host serine as a precursor for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine via a plant-like pathway involving phosphoethanolamine methylation. The monopartite phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase, Pfpmt, plays an important role in the biosynthetic pathway of this major phospholipid by providing the precursor phosphocholine via a three-step S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methylation of phosphoethanolamine. In vitro studies showed that Pfpmt has strong specificity for phosphoethanolamine. However, the in vivo substrate (phosphoethanolamine or phosphatidylethanolamine) is not yet known. We used yeast as a surrogate system to express Pfpmt and provide genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrating the specificity of Pfpmt for phosphoethanolamine in vivo. Wild-type yeast cells, which inherently lack phosphoethanolamine methylation, acquire this activity as a result of expression of Pfpmt. The Pfpmt restores the ability of a yeast mutant pem1Δpem2Δ lacking the phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase genes to grow in the absence of choline. Lipid analysis of the Pfpmt-complemented pem1Δpem2Δ strain demonstrates the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine but not the intermediates of phosphatidylethanolamine transmethylation. Complementation of the pem1Δpem2Δ mutant relies on specific methylation of phosphoethanolamine but not phosphatidylethanolamine. Interestingly, a mutation in the yeast choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase gene abrogates the complementation by Pfpmt thus demonstrating that Pfpmt activity is directly coupled to the Kennedy pathway for the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine.

With more than 1 million deaths and 300 million clinical cases annually, malaria is a major worldwide health concern and a major economic burden to the developing world (1.WHO Expert Committee of MalariaWorld Health Organ. Tech. Rep. Ser. 2000; 892: 1-74Google Scholar). The illness is caused by intraerythrocytic protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Plasmodium falciparum, which is responsible for the most severe form of the disease, has developed resistance to almost all the available drugs in the antimalarial armamentarium (2.White N.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). New chemotherapeutic strategies are therefore urgently needed to combat this disease. One strategy is to target the ability of the parasite to synthesize new membranes and inhibit its replication within host erythrocytes. Lipid inhibitors such as choline and phosphocholine analogs have been shown to inhibit P. falciparum membrane biogenesis and to block parasite proliferation (3.Ancelin M.L. Calas M. Bompart J.

Biochemical studies have indicated that the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), 1The abbreviations used are: PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; PtdEtn, phosphatidylethanolamine; Pfpmt, P. falciparum phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; P-Cho, phosphocholine; P-Etn, phosphoethanolamine; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PMT, phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase; SDPM, serine decarboxylation-phosphoethanolamine methylation. the major phospholipid in P. falciparum membranes can occur via two metabolic pathways, the de novo choline → phosphocholine → CDP-choline pathway, also named the Kennedy pathway, and a newly identified route that we named the serine decarboxylation-phosphoethanolamine methylation (SDPM) pathway (6.Pessi G.

J. 1997; 324: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The Kennedy pathway initiates with the transport of choline from host serum into the parasite cytoplasm by unidentified erythrocyte and P. falciparum choline transporters. Choline is then converted into PtdCho by the sequential action of choline kinase, choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, and CDP-diacyl-glycerol-cholinephosphotransferase (9.Vial H.J. Thuet M.J.

The SDPM pathway initiates from serine that is either transported from the host or obtained from active degradation of host proteins (13.Francis S.E. Sullivan Jr., D.J. Goldberg D.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 14.Kirk K. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 495-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Serine is first decarboxylated to form ethanolamine by a serine decarboxylase and then phosphorylated to produce phosphoethanolamine (P-Etn) by an ethanolamine kinase (8.Elabbadi N. Ancelin M.L. Vial H.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). P-Etn is subsequently methylated to generate phosphocholine (P-Cho) by a phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase (Pfpmt) (6.Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The P-Cho enters the Kennedy pathway to form PtdCho. The SDPM pathway has thus far been characterized only in P. falciparum and plants (6.Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Pfpmt is expressed throughout the intraerythrocytic cycle as well as during the gametocyte and sporozoite stages of the parasite (6.Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pfpmt does not share homology with phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) methyltransferases from lower and higher eukaryotes, and no other homologs of this protein could be found in human or other mammalian data bases (6.Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Unlike the bipartite structure of plant phosphoethanolamine methyltransferases with two AdoMet-dependent catalytic domains, the malarial Pfpmt is only half the size of plant phosphoethanolamine methyltransferases and possesses a single catalytic domain solely responsible for the three-step AdoMet-dependent methylation of P-Etn into P-Cho (6.Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although biochemical studies in vitro showed that Pfpmt and plant phosphoethanolamine methyltransferases were specific for P-Etn and did not catalyze the methylation of PtdEtn (6.Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), one cannot exclude that these phosphoethanolamine methyltransferases (PMT) also catalyze the methylation of PtdEtn in vivo. The difficulty in genetically manipulating P. falciparum, and the fact that yeast cells lack the ability to convert P-Etn into P-Cho make yeast an attractive system to assess the specificity of Pfpmt in vivo. In yeast grown in the absence of choline, the synthesis of PtdCho occurs primarily via the transmethylation of PtdEtn by two methyltransferases encoded by the PEM1 (CHO2) and PEM2 (OPI3) genes (20.Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15428-15435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A.

Individual deletions of PEM1 or PEM2 cause no discernable phenotypes, whereas disruption of both genes is lethal unless choline is provided exogenously and transported via the choline transporter Hnm1 (20.Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15428-15435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1988; 120: 909-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have taken advantage of the extensive biochemical and genetic knowledge of phospholipid metabolism in yeast to examine the in vivo substrate specificity of Pfpmt. Our data provide biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrating that in vivo Pfpmt does not catalyze the transmethylation of PtdEtn to form PtdCho but instead catalyzes the methylation of P-Etn into P-Cho. Furthermore, we show that Pfpmt plays an important role in PtdCho biosynthesis by coupling its activity to the Kennedy pathway. Strain Construction, Growth Conditions, and Media—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are described in Table I. Standard methods for yeast culture and manipulation were used (23.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology in Methods in Enzymology.

Genetics. 1998; 150: 553-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in synthetic minimal media containing 2% glucose (SD medium) or 2% galactose (SG medium) supplemented with histidine (30 μg/ml), uracil (30 μg/ml), leucine (100 μg/ml), methionine (100 μg/ml), or choline (140 μg/ml) as required to maintain cell growth.Table IStrains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceBY4741 (ScCHO1)MATa his3ΔI leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0Research geneticsWild type (ScCHO159)MATa his3ΔI leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 [pYES2.1 GAL1 URA3]This studypem1Δ (ScCHO29)MATa his3ΔI leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 pem1::KanrResearch geneticspem2Δ (ScCHO30)MATα his3ΔI leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 pem2::KanrResearch geneticspem1Δpem2Δ (ScCHO33)MATα his3ΔI leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 pem1::Kanr-pem2::KanrThis studyScCHO265MATa his3ΔI leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 [pYES2.1 GAL1 URA3]This studyScCHO222MATa his3ΔI leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 [pYES2.1 GAL1::PfPMTCO URA3]This studyScCHO266MATα his3ΔI leu2Δ0 pem1::Kanr pem2::Kanr [pYES2.1 GAL1 URA3]This studyScCHO226MATα his3ΔI leu2Δ0 pem1::Kanr pem2::Kanr [pYES2.1 GAL1::PfPMTCO URA3]This studyCMY134MATα his3ΔI leu2Δ uraΔ trp1Δ ade2Δ cho2::LEU2 pct1tsC.

PfPMTCO was first assembled and amplified as four 200-bp long fragments that were subsequently used as templates to amplify the whole gene. Assembly reactions were performed as described by Santiago et al. (25.Santiago T.C. Zufferey R. Mehra R.S. Coleman R.A. Mamoun C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9222-9232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The program for assembly is the following: 2 min at 94 °C, 25 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 68 °C and a 3-min final elongation at 68 °C. The resulting products were purified and used as templates for amplification using the following PCR program: 2 min at 94 °C, 20 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 63 °C, and 45 s at 68 °C and a 2-min final elongation at 68 °C. The full-length PfPMTCO was TA-cloned into the vector PCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Using the primers 5′-PfPMTCO 5′-ATGACTTTGATCGAGAACTTGAACTCTGATAAGACCTTCCTGGAGAA-3′ and 3′-PfPMTCO 5′-GTTCTTGGTGGCCTTGAAGTAAC-3′, PfPMTCO was amplified and cloned into the vector pYES2.1-/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen), obtaining pYES2.1 GAL1::PfPMTCO. The sequence of PfPMTCO was verified by DNA sequencing. Phospholipid Analysis—Wild-type-pYES2.1 and pem1Δpem2Δ-PfPMTCO cells were grown overnight in SG medium supplemented with 2 mm ethanolamine and in the absence of choline. The cells were diluted to A600 = 0.005 in 75 ml of fresh SG medium and grown to A600 ∼1.5. Cells were harvested and washed twice with water. Lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method (26.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) and separated on a two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (TLC). For the first dimension a solvent containing chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (84.5: 45.5:6:5) was used. The second solvent system was composed of chloroform/glacial acetic acid/methanol/water (90:30:6:2.6). Lipids were stained with iodine vapor. Each lipid spot was excised from the plate and quantified by measuring phosphorus (27.Rouser G. Siakatose A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1996; 1: 85-86Crossref Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). The results are shown as the percentage of total lipid phosphorus in each phospholipid fraction. Purification of Pfpmt in Yeast and Protein Immunoblotting—S. cerevisiae wild-type and pem1Δpem2Δ cells harboring pYES2.1 and pYES2.1 GAL1::PfPMTCO were grown in 50 ml of SD or SG media to A600 = 1 at 30 °C. Extract preparation and purification of the His6-V5-tagged Pfpmt by affinity chromatography were performed as described previously (25.Santiago T.C. Zufferey R. Mehra R.S. Coleman R.A. Mamoun C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9222-9232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed using affinity-purified proteins from cells grown in minimal medium glucose or galactose. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by immunoblot using anti-V5 primary (Invitrogen, 1:5000 dilution) and anti-mouse secondary (1:10 000 dilution) antibodies. Enzyme Assays—Yeast cells were grown in 50 ml of SD or SG media to A600 = 1 at 30 °C and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mix by agitation with acid-washed glass beads. The 10,000 × g supernatant was dialyzed against 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Pfpmt was then affinity-purified as recommended by the manufacturer. PMT activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of radioactivity from [methyl-14C]AdoMet into P-Etn as described previously (6.Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture in a final volume of 100 μl, contained 100 mm Hepes, pH 8.6, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 100 μm P-Etn, 100 μm AdoMet (100 nCi of [methyl-14C]AdoMet), and 50 μg of crude extract or affinity-purified recombinant enzyme. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold H2O. The product was purified through a AG (H+) resin, and the identity of the reaction product was confirmed by TLC using [14C]P-Cho (55 mCi/mmol; ARC) as a standard. Pfpmt activity was also measured using 100 μm ethanolamine and 100 μm PtdEtn as described previously (6.Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For determination of PtdEtn methyltransferase activity, a PtdEtn emulsion was prepared by sonication in the presence of 0.02% Triton X-100 as described previously (16.Nuccio M.L. Ziemak M.J. Henry S.A. Weretilnyk E.A. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14095-14101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28.Ridgway N.D. Vance D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the reaction was performed in Tris buffer, pH 8.5, using 50 μg of crude extract. Wild-type Yeast Cells Expressing the Codon-optimized PfPMTCO Acquire Phosphoethanolamine Methyltransferase Activity—The inability of the yeast S. cerevisiae to catalyze the three-step methylation of P-Etn for synthesis of P-Cho (Fig. 1) made it possible to assess biochemically and genetically the substrate specificity of P. falciparum Pfpmt in vivo. Because of the high A+T content of PfPMT (72.5% A+T-rich) and to allow its successful expression in yeast, the full codon sequence of the cDNA was reconstructed in vitro to augment its G+C content. Thirty-two 50-nucleotide overlapping primers were first assembled, and the resulting assembly product was used as a template for PCR amplification to create a codon-optimized gene, PfPMTCO, with 51.3% A+T content (Fig. 2). PfPMTCO was then cloned downstream of the GAL1-inducible promoter in the yeast expression vector pYES2.1, which allowed addition of a C-terminal V5-His6 epitope tag to monitor protein expression. As shown in Fig. 3A, expression of Pfpmt could be detected in wild-type yeast cells grown in the presence of galactose, which induces GAL1 promoter-regulated genes but not in the presence of glucose, which represses GAL1 promoter-regulated expression.Fig. 3Pfpmt expression in S. cerevisiae. A, Western blot analysis was performed using crude extracts from BY4741-pYES2.1 (wild-type, WT) and BY4741-GAL1-PfPMTCO (WT+Pfpmt) grown at 30 °C in minimal medium supplemented with 1 mm choline and containing glucose (Glu) or galactose (Gal) as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, S. cerevisiae was grown in SD (Glu) or SG (Gal) media, and the PMT activity was measured in absence (WT) or presence (WT+Pfpmt) of the malarial Pfpmt. PMT activity in S. cerevisiae extracts was determined using phosphoethanolamine (P-Etn) and [14C]AdoMet as substrates. The activity was measured at 30 °C in the presence of 50 μg of S. cerevisiae protein extract, and the product phosphocholine (P-Cho) was purified using AG-50(H+) ion exchange resin. Each value is the mean of duplicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the expression of Pfpmt can provide yeast with the ability to catalyze the three-step methylation of P-Etn into P-Cho, protein extracts were prepared from wild-type cells expressing either GAL1-PfPMTCO or, as a control, the empty vector under galactose and glucose conditions and incubated with the substrate P-Etn and the methyl donor [14C]AdoMet. The products of the reactions were purified by ion exchange chromatography, analyzed by thin layer chromatography, and quantified. Wild-type cells expressing Pfpmt grown in the presence of galactose were able to catalyze the three-step AdoMet-dependent methylation of P-Etn to form P-Cho, whereas the same cells grown in presence of glucose or wild-type cells expressing the empty vector failed to catalyze this reaction (Fig. 3B). Pfpmt was further purified from wild-type cells grown in the presence of galactose by nickel affinity chromatography, and its activity and substrate specificity were analyzed. Similar to the PMT activity measured in P. falciparum extracts or that of the Escherichia coli recombinant-purified enzyme (6.Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), Pfpmt purified from yeast catalyzed the three-step AdoMet-dependent methylation of P-Etn to form P-Cho (Fig. 4, A and B). The enzyme preparation showed only background activity when ethanolamine or PtdEtn were used as substrates (Fig. 4C). PfPMTCO Suppresses the Choline Auxotrophy of a Yeast pem1Δpem2Δ Mutant—Yeast cells lack PMT activity. However, they express two genes PEM1 and PEM2, which encode two enzymes required for the three-step transmethylation of PtdEtn into PtdCho. Deletion of either PEM1 or PEM2 produces viable strains, whereas deletion of both genes is lethal unless external choline is provided (20.Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15428-15435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1988; 120: 909-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether expression of Pfpmt can complement the loss of PtdEtn transmethylation, a yeast strain, pem1Δpem2Δ, lacking PEM1 and PEM2 was constructed and transformed with the GAL1-PfPMTCO plasmid or the empty vector. The resulting transformants were confirmed to express Pfpmt by immunoblotting using anti-V5 monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 5A) and were further tested for their ability to grow in the absence of choline under inducing (in presence of galactose) and repressing (in presence of glucose) conditions (Fig. 5B). Because of residual choline in agar containing media, the assays were performed in both solid and liquid media. As expected pem1Δpem2Δ cells expressing the empty vector required choline for growth under both glucose and galactose conditions. In contrast, pem1Δpem2Δ cells expressing GAL1-PfPMTCO were able to grow in the absence of choline when galactose was the sole carbon source but required choline when grown in the presence of glucose (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate that Pfpmt suppresses the choline auxotrophy of the pem1Δpem2Δ mutant. PtdCho Biosynthesis by Pfpmt Is Independent of PtdEtn Transmethylation—To confirm that Pfpmt suppression of the choline auxotrophy of pem1Δpem2Δ is via restoration of the synthesis of PtdCho, phospholipids were prepared from wild-type and pem1Δpem2Δ-GAL1-PfPMTCO cells, grown in absence of choline, analyzed by TLC, and quantified. PtdCho could be detected in both strains (Fig. 6A), although the level of this phospholipid in the pem1Δpem2Δ-GAL1-PfPMTCO strain constituted only 32% of what is synthesized by wild-type cells (Fig. 6B). In addition, the PtdEtn level in the pem1Δpem2Δ-GAL1-PfPMTCO strain was almost double that of the wild-type cells (Fig. 6), suggesting continuous accumulation of this phospholipid as a result of synthesis via phosphatidylserine decarboxylation and the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. Interestingly, significant amounts of phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine (PtdEtn(Me)2) could be detected in wild-type cells but no intermediates of PtdEtn transmethylation could be detected in the pem1Δpem2Δ-GAL1-PfPMTCO cells (Fig. 6). Together these results suggest that Pfpmt-mediated synthesis of PtdCho is not via methylation of PtdEtn but rather via the methylation of P-Etn. To further validate this interpretation we assessed the specificity of protein extracts prepared from wild-type, pem1Δpem2Δ, and pem1Δpem2Δ-GAL1-PfPMTCO cells for P-Etn versus PtdEtn substrates. Protein extracts from wild-type cells catalyzed the transmethylation of PtdEtn into PtdCho, but showed no specificity toward P-Etn substrate (Fig. 7A). On the other hand, protein extracts from pem1Δpem2Δ-GAL1-PfPMTCO cells catalyzed the three-step methylation of P-Etn into P-Cho but showed no specificity for PtdEtn substrate (Fig. 7). As expected protein extracts from pem1Δpem2Δ grown in the presence of choline lacked both P-Etn and PtdEtn methylation activities (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Methyltransferase activity in S. cerevisiae.

Zaremberg V. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44100-44107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This mutant harbors, in addition to a genetic deletion of the PEM1 gene, a spontaneous thermo-sensitive mutation in the PCT1 gene encoding choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, the second step in the CDP-choline pathway, thus resulting in a growth defect at 37 °C. Expression of Pfpmt did not complement the thermosensitivity of the pem1Δpct1ts (Fig. 8). As a control the pem1Δpem2Δ strain harboring Pfpmt grew normally in the absence of choline at 30 (Fig. 5B) and 37 °C (not shown), whereas the pem1Δpem2Δ strain harboring an empty vector required choline for growth at both temperatures (not shown). Together, these results suggest that Pfpmt function is directly coupled to the Kennedy pathway, further demonstrating the specificity of this enzyme for P-Etn in vivo. Membrane biogenesis is essential for P. falciparum development and multiplication with human erythrocytes. Understanding this process is an important step toward designing better therapeutic strategies to block parasite replication and eliminate the pathological symptoms associated with the intraerythrocytic cycle of the parasite. Upon infection of human erythrocytes, the phospholipid content of P. falciparum increases by at least 5–6-fold (30.Sherman I.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1979; 43: 453-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Available data suggest that the synthesis of PtdCho, the major phospholipid in P. falciparum membranes, can occur via two metabolic pathways: the Kennedy pathway that proceeds from choline and a newly identified route that we named the SDPM pathway that proceeds from serine. The Pfpmt enzyme of P. falciparum plays an important role in the SDPM pathway by providing P-Cho via methylation of serine-derived P-Etn (6.Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The resultant P-Cho then enters the Kennedy pathway for the synthesis of PtdCho. Pfpmt is expressed throughout the intraerythrocytic cycle as well as during the gametocyte and sporozoite stages of the parasite, and possesses a single catalytic domain solely responsible for the three-step AdoMet-dependent methylation of P-Etn to form P-Cho (6.Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because no homologs of PtdEtn methyltransferases could be found in the finished genome sequence of P. falciparum, it remained unclear whether in vivo Pfpmt might also catalyze the three-step methylation of PtdEtn. In the present study we provide genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrating that the primary function of Pfpmt in vivo is to catalyze the methylation of P-Etn to form P-Cho. Six lines of evidence support this important conclusion. First, expression of Pfpmt in wild-type S. cerevisiae cells, which inherently lack P-Etn methyltransferase activity, resulted in their acquiring this activity. Second, PMT activity of wild-type yeast expressing Pfpmt was specific for P-Etn, and no methylation of ethanolamine or PtdEtn could be detected. Third, expression of Pfpmt in a yeast mutant, pem1Δpem2Δ, lacking the two genes PEM1 and PEM2, which encode the enzymes Pem1 and Pem2 essential for the synthesis of PtdCho from PtdEtn, resulted in a complete suppression of their requirement for exogenous choline. Fourth, lipid analysis of the pem1Δpem2Δ cells expressing Pfpmt demonstrated the synthesis of PtdCho in the absence of choline, but unlike the wild-type strain, no intermediates of the transmethylation of PtdEtn could be detected in the complemented strain. Fifth, the PtdEtn level in the pem1Δpem2Δ strain expressing Pfpmt was almost double that of the wild-type cells, suggesting continuous accumulation of this phospholipid as a result of synthesis via phosphatidylserine decarboxylation and the CDP-ethanolamine pathway in conjunction with the elimination of PtdEtn methylation. Finally, complementation of pem1Δpem2Δ choline auxotrophy by Pfpmt required a functional Kennedy pathway, because alteration of this pathway by mutation in the PCT1 gene abolishes this complementation. The ability of Pfpmt to complement pem1Δpem2Δ mutant depends on the availability of the P-Etn substrate. In fact, the growth of the complemented strain was much better when the medium was supplemented with ethanolamine (not shown). In the absence of exogenous ethanolamine, this precursor could be obtained either via degradation of sphingosine-1-phosphate by the lyase encoded by the DPL1 gene, or via hydrolysis of PtdEtn by the Ca2+-dependent phospholipase D activity. Interestingly, although the complemented and wild-type strains grew equally well in the absence of choline, the level of PtdCho (as percent total phospholipid) in the complemented strain was only ∼4% in the absence (not shown) and ∼12% in the presence (Fig. 6) of ethanolamine. In contrast PtdCho was ∼40% total phospholipid present in wild-type cells. These data suggest that although PtdCho is the major phospholipid in yeast membranes, its level in wild-type cells far exceeds what is needed for growth and survival, at least under laboratory conditions. To enhance expression of Pfpmt in yeast, we completely redesigned its cDNA by reducing its A+T content from 72.5 to 51.3% to prevent early transcriptional termination. Successful expression of Pfpmt was demonstrated by inserting a V5-His6 tag in the C-terminal region of the encoded protein and monitoring expression levels using anti-V5 monoclonal antibodies. Pfpmt was further purified from yeast cells by affinity chromatography and used in enzymatic assays. Similar success in complementing yeast after codon optimization was achieved with PfGAT gene of P. falciparum, which encodes a glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase of the endoplasmic reticulum important for the initial step of malarial glycerolipid metabolism (25.Santiago T.C. Zufferey R. Mehra R.S. Coleman R.A. Mamoun C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9222-9232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Pfpmt purified from yeast exhibited the same biochemical properties as the native PMT activity obtained from P. falciparum or recombinant Pfpmt purified from E. coli (6.Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Our present results are concordant with previous biochemical analysis using recombinant Pfpmt purified from E. coli and provide strong evidence that Pfpmt exhibits high specificity toward the P-Etn substrate and does not catalyze the methylation of PtdEtn in vivo. Thus it seems that the most critical precursor for the synthesis of PtdCho in P. falciparum is P-Cho, which can be obtained either via Pfpmt methylation of serine-derived P-Etn or by phosphorylation of choline transported by the parasite choline transporter from the host. The relative contribution of the two pathways to the total cellular pool of PtdCho is not yet clear. Recent studies have provided new information about the biochemical properties of the parasite choline transporter (31.Lehane A.M. Saliba K.J. Allen R.J. Kirk K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 32.Biagini G.A. Pasini E.M. Hughes R. De Koning H.P. Vial H.J. O'Neill P.M. Ward S.A. Bray P.G. Blood. 2004; 104: 3372-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the genes encoding choline transport activity have not yet been identified in Plasmodium or any other protozoan parasite. More detailed genetic studies in P. falciparum are now needed to evaluate the importance of choline transport and Pfpmt in phospholipid synthesis as it relates to parasite development and survival. In summary, we have shown that Pfpmt is a highly specific methyltransferase enzyme acting exclusively on P-Etn substrate in vivo. The essential dependence of the pem1Δpem2Δ mutant on Pfpmt for growth and survival makes this strain an ideal system to screen for inhibitors that can specifically inhibit Pfpmt activity. We thank Christopher R. McMaster at Dalhousie University, Canada for providing the CMY134 strain."
https://openalex.org/W1967047873,"TFII-I is a signal-induced multi-functional transcription factor that has recently been implicated as a regulatory component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. TFII-I acts through ER stress-induced binding to the ER stress element, which is highly conserved in promoters of ER stress-inducible genes such as Grp78/BiP. Interestingly, its tyrosine phosphorylation sites are required for its activation of the Grp78 promoter. Toward understanding the link between TFII-I, the tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, and Grp78 activation, we discovered that Tg stress induces a dramatic increase of TFII-I phosphorylation at Tyr248 and localization of this form of TFII-I to the nucleus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis further reveals enhanced TFII-I binding to the Grp78 promoter in vivo upon ER stress. Previously, we reported that genistein, a general inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, could suppress ER stress induction of Grp78 by inhibiting complex formation on the ER stress element; however, the mechanism is not known. Consistent with TFII-I being a target of genistein suppression, we observed that genistein could suppress Tg stress-induced phosphorylation of TFII-I. We further demonstrate that c-Src, which is one of kinases identified to mediate phosphorylation of TFII-I at Tyr248, is activated by Tg stress and is able to stimulate the Grp78 promoter activity. Lastly, using stable cell lines with suppressed TFII-I levels, we show that TFII-I is required for optimal induction of Grp78 by ER stress. Our studies provide a molecular link that connects the c-Src tyrosine kinase transduction pathway to ER stress-induced transcriptional activation of Grp78 mediated by TFII-I."

Beatrix B. Kreibich G. Sakai H. Lauring B. Wiedmann M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It was originally characterized as the first ribosome-associated protein to contact the emerging polypeptide chain (2Wiedmann B. Sakai H. Davis T.A. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1994; 370: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Protease protection assays further suggested that NAC might function as a shield for newly synthesized polypeptides against inappropriate interaction with cytosolic factors (3Wang S. Sakai H. Wiedmann M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It was proposed that cycles of binding and releasing NAC would expose the polypeptide to the cytosol in “quantal units,” rather than amino acid by amino acid. NAC would thus contribute to fidelity in cotranslational processes such as targeting and folding. NAC was also shown to play a role in regulation of ribosome access to the translocation pore in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in cotranslational protein translocation (4Lauring B. Kreibich G. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9435-9439Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 5Lauring B. Sakai H. Kreibich G. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Still, the cellular function of NAC seems to be diverse and is probably not restricted to translation, because transcription-related functions have been suggested for the human αNAC subunit (7Yotov W.V. Moreau A. St-Arnaud R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, yeast NAC was shown to play a role in the import of proteins into mitochondria (8Fünfschilling U. Rospert S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3289-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The importance of the in vivo function of NAC is emphasized by early embryonically lethal phenotypes of NAC mutants in mice, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans (9Deng J.M.

Furthermore, intracellular levels of the individual NAC subunits change dramatically in the context of several human diseases, such as Alzheimer disease, Trisomy 21, AIDS, and malignant brain tumors, and a role for NAC in apoptosis was only recently proposed (11Kim S.H.

Two recent comparative studies of completed archaeal genomes revealed that all of them contain one gene with apparent homology to NAC (15Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Grishin N.V.

It forms a homodimer and as eukaryotic NAC it is ribosome associated, binds to ribosomal RNA, and is in contact with the nascent chain. We present the first crystal structure of a NAC protein that provides an explanation for the unusually stable dimer formation and also implies a yet unidentified role for NAC on the ribosome, namely involvement in the cellular protein quality control system via the ubiquitination pathway.

Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (25 min, 4 °C, 11,000 rpm, SS34 rotor; Sorvall). To remove membranes and aggregates, the supernatant was spun again at 38,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C in a 60Ti rotor (Beckman). This supernatant was called S100. Aliquots of S100 extract were adjusted to 150, 300, 500, and 1000 mm potassium acetate. 80 μl of extract (100 μg of protein) were loaded onto a 120-μl sucrose cushion (20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 25 mm Mg(Ac)2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 m sucrose, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 150, 300, 500 or 1000 mm KAc) and spun for 1 h at 100,000 rpm in a TLA-100 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C. Ribosomal pellets were resuspended in H2O. One half of the supernatant and the pellet (0.45–0.48 A260 units) were trichloroacetic acid precipitated, proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, and supernatant and pellet were checked for the presence of aeNAC by Western blotting. From the other half of the supernatant and pellet, RNA was extracted with TRIzol following the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were run on an agarose gel to detect ribosomes by means of their rRNA.Protein Preparation and Crystallization—The gene of Δ1–18aeNAC was amplified by PCR, cloned into the vector pET28a (Novagen), expressed in E. coli, and purified by a combination of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Qiagen) with subsequent thrombin cleavage, anion exchange (SAX-PolymerLabs), and size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex S75; Amersham Biosciences). The selenomethionine-substituted Δ1–18aeNAC was expressed using the procedure of Budisa (19Budisa N. Steipe B. Demange P. Eckerskorn C. Kellermann J. Huber R. Eur. J.

Crystals were grown at 18 °C in 1.6 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0, using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. For both the Δ1–18aeNAC and the selenomethionine derivative, well diffracting crystals were obtained by streak seeding.Data Collection and Structure Determination—Before data collection, crystals were transferred to 3.0 m sodium malonate and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar), followed by isotropic individual B-factor refinement using REFMAC5, gave a model with R and Rfree values of 19.4 and 24.1%.RESULTSArchaea Contain a NAC Homolog—In eukaryotes, NAC is a heterodimeric complex of α and β subunits that are highly conserved among eukaryotes. Furthermore, the α and β subunits of the complex share considerable similarity with each other. A search for conserved domains in NAC using the Pfam data base (29Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 138-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed two distinct domains, a unique “NAC domain” that is exclusively found in both the α- and βNAC proteins and a “UBA (ubiquitin-associated) domain” that is only present at the C terminus of αNAC. Two recent comparative studies of archaebacterial genomes (15Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Grishin N.V. Tatusov R.L. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 608-628PubMed Google Scholar, 30Macario A.J. Conway De Macario E. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: 262-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed the possible existence of an apparent ortholog of αNAC in Archaea with the same conserved domain organization (Fig. 1A). For βNAC no ortholog was found. The close αNAC ortholog MTH177 (PDB accession number NP_275320) was identified in M. thermoautotrophicus. See supplemental Fig. 1 for amino acid sequence alignments of MTH177 with human αNAC and of archaebacterial NAC homologs representative for different taxonomic groups. MTH177 will be called from here on aeNAC for “archaebacterial NAC.”aeNAC Is Expressed in M. marburgensis—Because, to date, only genomic sequencing suggested the presence of a NAC homolog in Archaea we cloned the gene mth177 from M. marburgensis and expressed it as a His tag fusion protein in E. coli. The purified recombinant protein was used to raise polyclonal antibodies in a rabbit. Fig. 1B shows an SDS-PAGE and a Western blot with purified His-aeNAC (lanes 1 and 5) and total cell extract from M. marburgensis (lanes 2 and 6). The antibodies clearly react only against one protein of the expected size in the archaebacterial extract. The recombinant protein is slightly larger because of the His tag. The antiserum also cross-reacts with the homolog of Methanococcus jannashii (MJ0280, accession number NP_247253, 128 amino acids, lanes 3 and 7), which is slightly larger, and, more importantly, even with the α subunit of human NAC (lanes 4 and 8). No cross-reactivity was observed with the mammalian βNAC subunit (lanes 4 and 8).aeNAC Is Associated with Ribosomes in M. marburgensis—To address the question of whether aeNAC is associated with ribosomes we sedimented ribosomes from a Dnase-treated S100 extract of M. marburgensis through sucrose cushions at different salt concentrations. aeNAC was detected in one half of the pellet (0.45–0.48 A260 units) and supernatant with the rabbit anti-serum. Fig. 1C, upper panel, shows that at 150 mm salt about 60% of aeNAC sediments with ribosomes. At 300 mm salt less aeNAC (∼30%) sediments with the ribosomes, and at 500 mm salt ribosome association is almost abolished. As no antibody against an archaeal ribosomal protein is available yet, we extracted RNA from the other half of the pellet and the supernatant with TRIzol and ran samples on an agarose gel. Fig. 1C, lower panel, shows that all ribosomes sediment under these conditions, as 23 S and 16 S rRNA are only found in the pellet fractions.aeNAC Is in Contact with Nascent Chains on the Ribosome— If aeNAC is the functional homolog of eukaryotic NAC in Archaea, it should be in very close vicinity to the nascent chain as it emerges from the ribosome. This characteristic can be tested in an approach where a photo-activable cross-linker (4-(3-trifluoromethyl-diazirino) benzoic acid (TDBA)-modified lysine) is incorporated into the nascent chain during in vitro translation. When using a truncated mRNA without a stop codon, the nascent chain remains on the ribosome and can be isolated as an RNC. Because no archaebacterial in vitro translation system using truncated mRNA has been described yet, we chose the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system to prepare RNCs using mRNA coding for the first 77 amino acids of firefly luciferase (77aaffLuc) and the TDBA cross-linker. 77aaffLuc RNCs were isolated by pelleting through a high salt sucrose cushion to remove ribosome-associated proteins (including endogenous NAC). RNCs were incubated with purified human NAC, yeast NAC, or aeNAC. Fig. 2A shows that upon irradiation both subunits of human NAC efficiently cross-link to the nascent chain (lane 3), whereas the yeast NAC subunits (as observed before) result in much weaker cross-links (lane 5). aeNAC also results in a strong cross-link to RNCs from rabbit reticulocyte lysate (lane 6).Fig. 2aeNAC interacts with nascent chains on ribosomes.A, high salt-stripped 77aaffLuc RNCs prepared in rabbit reticulocyte lysate with TDBA-lys-tRNA and l-[35S] methionine were incubated with human NAC, human NAC with an α subunit in which the C-terminal UBA domain was deleted at Glu-173 (hNACΔUBA), yeast NAC, or aeNAC as indicated. Samples were irradiated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Human and yeast α- and βNAC, human αNACΔUBA, as well as aeNAC were cross-linked to the nascent chain on the ribosome. When RNCs incubated with the proteins were sedimented through a sucrose cushion prior to irradiation the cross-link to yeast NAC and aeNAC was lost. B, high salt-stripped 77aaffLuc RNCs carrying the photo-cross-linker were incubated with a 5-fold excess of aeNAC followed by addition of human NAC. Samples were irradiated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Human NAC successfully competes with aeNAC for interaction with the nascent chain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When RNCs were sedimented through a low salt sucrose cushion (100 mm KOAc) prior to irradiation, both subunits of the human complex still cross-linked to the nascent chain consistent with previously published data (Fig. 2A, lane 7). In contrast, no cross-link to aeNAC (lane 10) was obtained anymore. This result is not due to the archaebacterial origin of the protein, because yeast NAC also could not be cross-linked anymore after sedimentation of the RNCs (lane 9). Rather, the binding partners of yeast NAC or aeNAC on the rabbit ribosome are not conserved enough to allow for tight interaction that would enable co-sedimentation of aeNAC or yeast NAC with rabbit ribosomes. Eukaryotic NAC needs the context of the ribosome to interact with nascent chains and cannot be cross-linked to polypeptide chains that are released from the ribosome by puromycin treatment (2Wiedmann B. Sakai H. Davis T.A. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1994; 370: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 17Beatrix B. Sakai H. Wiedmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37838-37845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similarly, no cross-link was obtained with aeNAC when RNCs were pretreated with puromycin to release polypeptide chains prior to addition of aeNAC and irradiation (data not shown).Human NAC Competes with aeNAC for Binding to the Nascent Chain—Because the archaeal NAC homolog gave such a strong cross-link when tested with RNCs from rabbit reticulocyte lysate, we further tested whether human NAC could compete with aeNAC for cross-linking to the nascent chain. Fig. 2B shows the result of an experiment in which 77aaffLuc RNCs derived from 3 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate were incubated with either 0.18 nmol aeNAC (lane 1) or with the same amount of aeNAC followed by a second incubation with 0.033 nmol human NAC (lane 2) prior to irradiation. Human NAC clearly competes with a 5-fold excess of aeNAC for contact with the nascent chain. This result probably reflects the higher affinity of eukaryotic NAC for its appropriate binding partners on a eukaryotic ribosome.Preparation, Crystallization, and Structure Determination of Δ1–18aeNAC—Despite extensive screening, no conditions were found in which human NAC, yeast NAC, or full-length aeNAC would crystallize. A treatment of aeNAC with different proteases, however, resulted in an almost full-length fragment resistant to proteolysis. Met-19 was identified as the first amino acid of the proteolytic fragment (data not shown). Crystallographically suitable crystals of purified Δ1–18aeNAC diffracting to ∼2.3 Å were obtained in 1.6 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0, by using streak seeding. The crystals belong to tetragonal space group P43212 with cell dimensions of 90.8, 90.8, and 49.5 Å and a solvent content of 50.7%. The crystal structure was solved from an electron density map that was calculated by using data collected from Δ1–18aeNAC protein containing selenomethionines and phased by the three-wavelength multiwavelength anomalous diffraction method. The free R of the refined structure to 2.27 Å resolution was 24.0%, whereas the working R factor was 19.4%. (See supplemental Table I summarizing the data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics and supplemental Fig. 2B for a stereo image of a portion of the electron density map.) The presented structure includes the residues 25–117 of aeNAC, as the N-terminal 6 amino acids of Δ1–18aeNAC are disordered in the crystal structure.Overall Structure of Δ1–18aeNAC—The crystal structure shows that Δ1–18aeNAC forms a homodimer (Fig. 3A). The monomer is composed of two distinct domains, a C-terminal compact three-helix bundle domain (residues 79-117) homologous to UBA domains (31Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 32Mueller T.D. Feigon J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and an N-terminal all-β domain (residues 25-70), forming the novel homodimeric NAC domain. The two domains of each monomer are connected via a highly flexible linker of 8 amino acids (residues 71–78). The novel homodimeric NAC domain forms a flattened β barrel with two distinct, but topologically similar, concave antiparallel β-sheet surfaces on each side of the flattened barrel (see supplemental Fig. 2A for a stereo image of the NAC domain). This unique domain can be described as a 6-stranded pseudo β-sheet barrel with the shear number S = 12 (33Murzin A.G. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1369-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 3). The homodimer interface of the NAC domain is tightly packed, showing a conserved pattern of alternating hydrophobic residues that build up the hydrophobic core of the dimeric NAC domain (see supplemental Fig. 4).Fig. 3Crystal structure of Δ1–18aeNAC.A, the homodimeric structure of Δ1–18aeNAC, highlighting the topological run of the polypeptide chain of one monomer.

The respective residues are conserved between archaeal and human NAC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the crystal structure, two of these dimers intercalate to form a tetramer (Fig. 3B). The two dimers interact with each other mainly via the linker region, forming a surprisingly large interface for a crystallographic contact, with a buried surface area of 1714 Å2 and 11 hydrogen bonds. No contact is made by the two “inner” surfaces of the NAC domains. To test the biological relevance of the tetramer, analytical ultracentrifugation was performed with Δ1–18aeNAC (in 20 mm TRIS, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl), revealing an estimated equilibrium of monomer to dimer with a Kd of 4 μm and for dimer to tetramer of 300 μm, suggesting that the dimer is the biologically relevant form.Structural Homologs of the NAC Domain and Structure-Function Implications—A structural similarity search using the DALI algorithm (34Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3552) Google Scholar) and the homodimeric NAC domain as search model yields no significant homologous or similar structures. Nevertheless, the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) folds and, in particular, their “fold-related ligand binding surface” show substantial similarity to the concave β-sheet surfaces of the NAC domain (Fig. 3C). The nucleic acid binding superfamily is the largest within the OB fold containing proteins exhibiting a similar concave-shaped β-sheet surface as ligand binding surface showing a characteristic conserved amino acid distribution (35Theobald D.L. Mitton-Fry R.M. Wuttke D.S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 36Arcus V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 794-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).In comparison with the OB fold, the NAC domain is a 6-stranded antiparallel β barrel and is composed of two polypeptide chains. Unlike OB folds, this homodimeric fold exhibits two topologically similar concave β-sheet surfaces that both show similarity to the canonical OB fold ligand binding surface. Both sides show characteristic features that could be responsible for binding to rRNA as the ligand. The “outer” surface of the NAC domain in Fig. 3C (which corresponds to the right side of the NAC domain in Fig. 3A"
https://openalex.org/W2019785646,"Chp (Cdc42 homologous protein) shares significant sequence and functional identity with the human Cdc42 small GTPase, and like Cdc42, promotes formation of filopodia and activates the p21-activated kinase serine/threonine kinase. However, unlike Cdc42, Chp contains unique amino- and carboxyl-terminal extensions. Here we determined whether Chp, like Cdc42, can promote growth transformation and evaluated the role of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences in Chp function. Surprisingly, we found that a GTPase-deficient mutant of Chp exhibited low transforming activity but that deletion of the amino terminus of Chp greatly enhanced its transforming activity. Thus, the amino terminus may serve as a negative regulator of Chp function. The carboxyl terminus of Cdc42 contains a CAAX (where C is cysteine, A is aliphatic amino acid, X is terminal amino acid) tetrapeptide sequence that signals for the posttranslational modification critical for Cdc42 membrane association and biological function. Although Chp lacks aCAAXmotif, we found that Chp showed carboxyl terminus-dependent localization to the plasma membrane and to endosomes. Furthermore, an intact carboxyl terminus was required for Chp transforming activity. However, treatment with inhibitors of protein palmitoylation, but not prenylation, caused Chp to mislocalize to the cytoplasm. Thus, Chp depends on palmitoylation, rather than isoprenylation, for membrane association and function. In summary, Chp is implicated in cell transformation, and the unique amino and carboxyl termini of Chp represent atypical mechanisms of regulation of Rho GTPase function.

In summary, Chp is implicated in cell transformation, and the unique amino and carboxyl termini of Chp represent atypical mechanisms of regulation of Rho GTPase function. The Rho family of small GTPases comprises one of the three major branches of the Ras superfamily (1.Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar, 2.Wherlock M. Mellor H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 239-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rho-related proteins are a diverse group with 22 human members identified to date. Of these, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 have been the most extensively studied and best understood. Thus, the general properties of the Rho family GTPases are based largely on the biochemical and biological characteristics of these three “classical” Rho GTPases (3.Wennerberg K. Der C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Rho family GTPases function as GDP/GTP-regulated binary switches. Nucleotide status is governed primarily by two classes of regulatory proteins (4.Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 5.Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Upon extracellular stimulation, guanine nucleotide exchange factors are activated and stimulate exchange of GDP for GTP, favoring the formation of the GTP-bound and active form of the GTPase. GTPase-activating proteins stimulate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, promoting formation of the inactive GDP-bound protein. In their GTP-bound or “on” conformation, Rho GTPases bind to multiple functionally distinct effector proteins that stimulate cytoplasmic signaling networks that regulate changes in actin cytoskeletal organization, cell cycle progression, and gene expression (6.Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 7.Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 8.Karnoub A.E. Symons M. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 84: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The majority of Rho family GTPases terminate in a CAAX (where C is cysteine, A is aliphatic amino acid, X is terminal amino acid residue) tetrapeptide motif that signals for a series of posttranslational modifications (3.Wennerberg K. Der C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Of greatest importance is the initial modification, which involves covalent attachment of a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl isoprenoid catalyzed by farnesyltransferase (FTase) 1The abbreviations used are: FTase, farnesyltransferase; GGTaseI, geranylgeranyltransferase I; GGTaseII, geranylgeranyltransferase II; Chp, Cdc42 homologous protein; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; 2-BP, 2-bromopalmitate; FTI, farnesyltransferase inhibitor; GGTI, geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitor; MTT, tetrazolium salt 3,[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; biotin-BMCC, 1-biotinamido-4-[4′-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxamido]butane; WT, wild type; PAK, p21-activated kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: FTase, farnesyltransferase; GGTaseI, geranylgeranyltransferase I; GGTaseII, geranylgeranyltransferase II; Chp, Cdc42 homologous protein; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; 2-BP, 2-bromopalmitate; FTI, farnesyltransferase inhibitor; GGTI, geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitor; MTT, tetrazolium salt 3,[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; biotin-BMCC, 1-biotinamido-4-[4′-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxamido]butane; WT, wild type; PAK, p21-activated kinase. or geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTaseI), respectively (9.Sebti S.M.

Protein prenylation, together with the subsequent proteolytic cleavage of the AAX residues and the carboxylmethylation of the now terminal prenylated cysteine, is critical for biological function, as it is necessary to promote Rho GTPase association with cellular membranes (11.Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Kreck M.L. Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D.

As with Ras proteins, the CAAX-directed modifications alone are not sufficient for final Rho GTPase localization. Instead, a second carboxyl-terminal targeting signal is needed to direct Ras and Rho GTPases to specific plasma or endomembrane locations. As with Ras proteins, the secondary signal is positioned immediately upstream of the CAAX motif and can consist of either a stretch of polybasic residues or a cysteine residue(s) that is posttranslationally modified by the addition of a palmitate fatty acid (16.Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The CAAX-directed modifications, together with these second signals, are necessary and sufficient to facilitate Rho and Ras GTPase membrane association and localization. Additional carboxyl-terminal sequences provide membrane association specificity and direct localization of Rho GTPases to at least six distinct subcellular localization patterns (17.Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Chp (Cdc42 homologous protein, also called Wrch-2) is a recently identified member of the Rho GTPase family (18.Aronheim A. Broder Y.C. Cohen A. Fritsch A. Belisle B. Abo A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1125-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chp shares significant sequence identity (52%) and functional similarity with Cdc42 (19.Aspenstrom P. Fransson A. Saras J. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Although Chp has a conserved Rho GTPase domain, it differs from Cdc42 and other Rho GTPases in two notable ways. First, Chp contains an additional 28 amino- and 16 carboxyl-terminal residues that are not found in Cdc42, making Chp a significantly larger protein than Cdc42. The amino-terminal extension is proline-rich and therefore may contain motifs recognized by Src homology 3 domain-containing proteins. Second, Chp lacks a carboxyl-terminal CAAX tetrapeptide motif and instead terminates in CFV. Surprisingly, despite the lack of a canonical CAAX motif, Chp still localizes to the plasma membrane like the other Rho-related GTPases (18.Aronheim A. Broder Y.C. Cohen A. Fritsch A. Belisle B. Abo A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1125-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the carboxyl terminus of Chp undergoes isoprenyl modification and is important for Chp membrane association, subcellular localization, and biological activity has not been determined. Constitutively activated Cdc42 causes growth transformation of rodent fibroblasts (20.Qiu R.G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 21.Roux P. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Doucet-Brutin S. Fort P. Curr.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4689-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although elevated expression of Chp in some human tumors has been described (24.Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2002; 20: 977-982PubMed Google Scholar), it is unknown whether Chp activation can also promote growth transformation. In the present study, we were surprised to find that deletion of the amino terminus promoted Chp transforming activity, suggesting that the amino terminus is a negative regulator of Chp function. In addition, we determined that the carboxyl terminus was critical for Chp transforming activity as well as Chp association with the plasma and endomembranes. Unlike the classical Rho GTPases, however, Chp membrane association is not dependent on protein prenylation and may instead depend on palmitoylation. These results show that despite their high degree of functional similarity, Cdc42 and Chp possess highly divergent mechanisms of regulation of function. Molecular Constructs—pCAN mammalian expression vectors that encode Myc epitope-tagged versions of wild type (WT), missense (G40V and S45N), and truncation mutants (ΔN, deletion of Chp residues 1–31; ΔC, deletion of Chp residues 204–236) of rat Chp were described previously (18.Aronheim A. Broder Y.C. Cohen A. Fritsch A. Belisle B. Abo A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1125-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Additional mammalian Chp expression vectors were created by ligation of cDNA sequences encoding wild type or mutant Chp (G40V, S45N, C227S, ΔN 40V, ΔC 40V, and ΔN/ΔC 40V) in-frame with amino-terminal sequences encoding a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag into the modified pBabe-puro-HAII retrovirus expression vector (a generous gift from T. Grana, UNC-Chapel Hill) or inframe with amino-terminal sequences encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the pEGFP-C3 expression vector (BD Biosciences). Additional cDNA sequences encoding other missense mutations were created by engineering the appropriate mutation by polymerase chain-mediated DNA amplification to encode the C227S and C234S point mutations in wild type or activated (G40V) Chp. Oligonucleotides designed to engineer the appropriate mutations were 5′-CTCTCTCGCTCTCGCTGGAAG-3′ for mutation of codon 227 (C227S) and 3′-GCGGGATCCTCAACAAAGGAGAAGAACTTCTTCC-5′ for mutation of codon 234 (C234S) for expression in the pEGFP-c3-Chp or pBabe-HAII-Chp expression constructs. pEGFP expression vectors encoding GFP-tagged human H-Ras, Cdc42, Rac1, and Rab5 were provided by M. Philips (New York University) and have been described previously (17.Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Tissue Culture, Transformation, and Lipid Inhibition Assays—NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (designated growth medium). 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (designated growth medium). For secondary focus formation transformation assays, we first established mass populations of NIH 3T3 cells that were stably transfected with pBabe-HAII expression vectors encoding WT Chp, Chp(40V), Chp(45N), ΔN-Chp(40V), ΔC-Chp(40V), or ΔN/ΔC-Chp(40V). After Western blot analyses to verify expression of the Chp protein, 1.6 × 105 cells were plated into 60-mm dishes and maintained in growth medium for 3 weeks, when the cells were fixed in 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid, and the number of foci of transformed cells was quantitated. To evaluate growth in soft agar, NIH 3T3 cells that were stably transfected with pBabe-HAII constructs encoding wild type or mutant Chp proteins were used in soft agar assays according to procedures described previously (25.Cox A.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For these analyses, 2.5 × 104 cells were plated in 0.4% agar per 60-mm dish. Cells were maintained in growth medium for 3 weeks, when the number of multicellular colonies was quantitated. The cultures were then stained with 5 mg/ml MTT (tetrazolium salt 3,[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 30 min and photographed. Fluorescence Microscopy—NIH 3T3 cells grown in growth medium were seeded in 35-mm dishes containing number 1.5 glass slides on the bottom (MatTek). Cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of the pEGFP-C3 constructs encoding the indicated GFP fusion protein using Lipofectamine Plus lipid transfection reagents (Invitrogen). Three h after transfection, cells were washed and maintained in growth medium for 20 h. Live cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter for fluorescence detection. To confirm localization to cellular membranes and endosomes, live cells were plated and transfected as described above and viewed live using a Zeiss 510 LSM confocal microscope. The highly selective farnesyltransferase (FTI-2153) and geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTI-2166) inhibitors were a kind gift from Dr. S. Sebti (Moffatt Cancer Center) and were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (26.Sun J. Blaskovich M.A. Knowles D. Qian Y. Ohkanda J. Bailey R.D. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4919-4926PubMed Google Scholar). Lovastatin, cerulenin, and 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) were purchased from Sigma and dissolved in ethanol. Control cultures were treated with the equivalent final concentration of ethanol or Me2SO (designated vehicle). In the inhibitor assays, cells were transfected as described above, washed, and incubated for 20 h with growth medium supplemented with 10 μm FTI-2153, 10 μm GGTI-2166, 100 μm 2-BP, 30 μm cerulenin, or 30 μm lovastatin. To determine whether Chp localized to mitochondrial or endosomal structures, NIH 3T3 cells that had been transfected as described above with 0.5 μg of pEGFP-Chp were incubated with 1 μm MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) for 20 min at 37 °C or 30 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and visualized live using a Zeiss 510 LSM confocal microscope. Biotin-BMCC Labeling—Direct analyses of protein palmitoylation were done as described previously (27.Drisdel R.C. Green W.N. BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 276-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 104 293T cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes and then transfected with 7 μg of the indicated pEGFP construct using a calcium phosphate transfection technique. Twenty after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer and incubated with 5 μg of monoclonal living colors anti-GFP antibody (BD Biosciences, JL-8) at 4 °C for 1 h, at which point 50 μg of protein G (Invitrogen) was added to the lysates and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The bound protein was washed and incubated with lysis buffer containing 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) for 48 h at 4 °C. The bound protein was then washed and treated with 1 m hydroxylamine, pH 7.4, to cleave the thioester bonds for 1 h at 25 °C, washed again, and treated with 1-biotinamido-4-[4′-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxamido]butane (biotin-BMCC, Pierce), which recognizes free sulfhydryl groups, for 2 h at 25 °C. The bound protein was washed again, resuspended in 20 μl of 5× sample loading buffer, and resolved by 12% PAGE. The protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the membrane was blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 at 25 °C for 1 h. The labeled protein was detected by incubating with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce), and the membrane was washed and exposed to x-ray film. 50 μl of lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred, incubated with anti-GFP primary antibody and anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody, and exposed to x-ray film to verify the presence of all GFP-tagged proteins. To determine whether Chp, like Cdc42, possesses transforming potential, we generated two missense mutants of Chp that are analogous to two activated and transforming mutants of Cdc42 (Fig. 1) (20.Qiu R.G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 21.Roux P. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Doucet-Brutin S. Fort P. Curr.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4689-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Chp(40V) mutant contains a G40V mutation that is analogous to the G12V mutation that renders Cdc42 and other Rho GTPases constitutively GTP-bound and constitutively active. The Chp(56L) mutant contains a Y56L mutation that is analogous to the F28L fast cycling Cdc42 mutation, which increases GDP/GTP cycling. To assess the ability of Chp to cause morphological and growth transformation of NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, we established NIH 3T3 cells that stably expressed wild type and mutant forms of Chp. Western blot analysis was performed to verify that there were equivalent levels of expression of each HA epitope-tagged Chp protein (data not shown). Cells that expressed WT or mutant Chp did not exhibit any significant morphological difference when compared with empty vector-transfected cells (data not shown), indicating that, consistent with our observations with other activated Rho GTPases, activated Chp did not cause morphologic transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. We next evaluated the ability of WT and mutants of Chp to cause growth transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. First, we determined whether stable overexpression of Chp could enable cells to lose their density-dependent growth inhibition and form foci of proliferating cells in confluent cultures by using a secondary focus formation assay. Expression of wild type Chp and Chp(56L) did not cause significant focus formation, and only very modest focus-forming activity was seen with Chp(40V) (Fig. 2A). These results are similar to what we have found with the equivalent mutants of Cdc42, where no significant focus-forming activity was seen (data not shown). Second, we assessed the ability of cells that stably express Chp to acquire anchorage-independent growth potential by evaluation of colony formation in soft agar. When compared with empty vector-transfected cells, cells that expressed wild type Chp exhibited a limited ability to form colonies, and cells that expressed Chp(40V) or Chp(56L) exhibited only a modest increase in colony formation (Fig. 2B). Therefore, we concluded that putative GTPase-deficient or fast cycling mutants of Chp do not possess potent transforming activity when assessed in two different growth transformation assays. Chp possesses additional amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences not found in Cdc42 (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we next determined whether deletion of these sequences could influence Chp transforming activity. The ΔN-Chp truncation mutant lacks the first 31 amino acids unique to Chp, whereas the ΔC-Chp truncation mutant lacks the last 33 unique amino acids, and ΔN/ΔC-Chp lacks both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal extensions (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, we found that cells expressing ΔN-Chp (WT or 40V) exhibited significant focus-forming activity as well as colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 2). In contrast, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal sequences abolished the transforming activity of wild type or GTPase-deficient Chp (40V) (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the amino terminus may play a negative regulatory role in Chp activity, whereas the carboxyl terminus is essential for Chp function. The carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif of Cdc42 is required for posttranslational modification by a geranylgeranyl isoprenoid lipid, which promotes Cdc42 membrane association and is therefore essential for Cdc42-mediated transformation. Because Chp lacks the CAAX motif found in Cdc42 and many other Rho family GTPases, we were surprised to find that the carboxyl terminus was essential for Chp transforming activity. However, other Ras superfamily proteins also lack carboxyl-terminal CAAX motifs yet exhibit critical dependence on the carboxyl terminus for membrane association and function (28.Lee C.H. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Maguire J. Santoro T. Jensen P. Siebenlist U. Yewdell J. Kelly K. Science. 1994; 265: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the possibility that the importance of the carboxyl terminus for Chp transforming activity was because of its role in facilitating Chp membrane association and subcellular location. We determined previously that Myc epitope-tagged Chp shows localization to Golgi membranes when analyzed in fixed porcine aortic endothelial cells (18.Aronheim A. Broder Y.C. Cohen A. Fritsch A. Belisle B. Abo A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1125-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, fixation artifacts have been described for localization analyses of Rho GTPases (17.Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Additionally, because we wanted to determine Chp localization in the same cell type that was used for our biological assays, we utilized live cell analyses of GFP-tagged versions of Rho GTPases in NIH 3T3 cells to evaluate the role of carboxyl-terminal sequences in the promotion of membrane association and regulation of subcellular location. Therefore, we generated an expression vector for GFP-tagged Chp and compared the subcellular location of Chp to that of the GFP-tagged versions of Cdc42 and Rac1 in live NIH 3T3 cells. In agreement with previous studies, GFP alone showed a nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic localization, whereas Cdc42 exhibited a cytoplasmic and endomembrane distribution, and Rac1 was associated mainly with the plasma membrane (17.Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In contrast, we observed GFP-Chp at the plasma membrane and additionally at punctate cytoplasmic locations that were distinct from the Golgi membrane-associated localization seen for Cdc42 (30.Erickson J.W. Zhang C. Kahn R.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26850-26854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). To determine the precise subcellular localization of Chp, we treated live cells that expressed GFP-Chp with Mito-Tracker Red, which is a mitochondrial marker, and transferrin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594, which labels early endosomal structures. Visualization of a merged image of GFP-Chp and MitoTracker showed that Chp did not co-localize with mitochondria. However, a significant amount of GFP-Chp co-localized with transferrin, which suggests that the punctate cytoplasmic distribution was Chp association with early endosomes (Fig. 4). Some Ras family GTPases, in particular those associated with endomembranes and involved in the regulation of vesicular trafficking, show nucleotide-dependent subcellular localization (31.Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). However, we found that both the putative GTP-bound Chp(40V) and GDP-bound Chp(S45N) mutants exhibited subcellular distribution comparable with the wild type protein (Fig. 3A).Fig. 4Chp co-localizes with endosomal structures. NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of pEGFP-Chp and labeled with MitoTracker, which labels mitochondria (A and B), or transferrin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 595, which labels early endosomes (C and D). Sites of co-localization are yellow. D, an enlarged version of C; co-localization of Chp and transferrin (yellow) is visible in a large portion of the endosomal structures. Data shown are representative of two independent experiments. Scale bars represent 10 μm in A, B, and C and 5 μm in D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because deletion of the amino terminus activated Chp transforming activity, we determined whether the amino terminus was important for regulating Chp subcellular localization. The subcellular distribution of GFP-ΔN-Chp was similar to that of wild type GFP-Chp, indicating that the enhanced transforming activity of this truncation mutant was not a consequence of gross alteration in subcellular localization. We then determined the role of the carboxyl terminus in Chp subcellular localization. We found that ΔC-Chp exhibited a loss of plasma membrane association and instead showed a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 3B). ΔN/ΔC-Chp also exhibited the same perturbation in subcellular localization. Hence, our data suggest that the loss of transforming activity seen with removal of the carboxyl terminus was most likely due to the loss of plasma membrane localization. Although the carboxyl terminus of Chp does not possess any known prenylation recognition motifs, it does contain two cysteine residues at positions 227 and 234 that may become modified by isoprenoid or palmitate groups. Therefore, we evaluated the importance of the two carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues in Chp membrane association and transforming activity. Similar to deletion of the entire carboxyl-terminal extension, mutation of the cysteine at position 234 (C234S), but not the upstream cysteine at position 227 (C227S), caused a loss of plasma and endomembrane association (Fig. 5A). Transformation analyses with Chp(40V/234S) emphasized the importance of localization in Chp function, as Chp(40V/234S) showed a complete loss of colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 5B) as well as abrogated focus-forming activity (data not shown). Surprisingly, cells that expressed Chp(40V/227S) showed enhanced ability for colony formation when compared with Chp(40V) (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, mutation of Cys-227 in wild type Chp (Chp(227S)) potently activated the ability of Chp to promote growth in soft agar (Fig. 5B). Thus, Cys-234 is essential for proper Chp subcellular location and transforming activity, whereas Cys-227 may serve a negative regulatory r"

The role of cellular architecture in these activities and the capacity of animals to tolerate aberrant acinar cell function are not known. A key regulator of acinar cell polarity is Mist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. Ca2+ signaling and amylase release were examined in pancreatic acini of wild type and Mist1 null mice to gain insight into the importance of cellular architecture for Ca2+ signaling and regulated exocytosis. Mist1–/– acinar cells exhibited dramatically altered Ca2+ signaling with up-regulation of the cholecystokinin receptor but minimal effect upon expression of the M3 receptor. However, stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production by cholecystokinin and carbachol was inefficient in Mist1–/– cells. Although agonist stimulation of Mist1–/– cells evoked a Ca2+ signal, often the Ca2+ increase was not in the form of typical Ca2+ oscillations but rather in the form of a peak/plateau-type response. Mist1–/– cells also displayed distorted apical-to-basal Ca2+ waves. The aberrant Ca2+ signaling was associated with mislocalization and reduced Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondria of stimulated Mist1–/– cells. Deletion of Mist1 also led to mislocalization of the Golgi apparatus and markedly reduced digestive enzyme content. The combination of aberrant Ca2+ signaling and reduced digestive enzyme content resulted in poor secretion of digestive enzymes. Yet, food consumption and growth of Mist1–/– mice were normal for at least 32 weeks. These findings reveal that Mist1 is critical to normal organelle localization in exocrine cells and highlight the critical importance of maintaining cellular architecture and polarized localization of cellular organelles in generating a propagating apical-to-basal Ca2+ wave. The studies also reveal the spare capacity of the exocrine pancreas that allows normal growth and development in the face of compromised exocrine pancreatic function.

The apical-to-basal Ca2+ waves are achieved by clustering Ca2+ signaling complexes at the apical pole (14.Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L.

This leads to an apical-to-basal gradient of responsiveness, with the most responsive GPCR Ca2+ signaling complexes at the apical pole (16.Li Q. Luo X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27837-27840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).

Once launched, the shape of the Ca2+ signals are regulated by many processes that affect the biochemical component of the Ca2+ signal that generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) as well as the biophysical component that includes the Ca2+ release and influx channels and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA2b) and plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) pumps (16.Li Q.

Subsequently, mitochondria were shown to communicate with Icrac channels to regulate Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane (24.Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J.

Mitochondrial localization in pancreatic acini is even more intricate. In these cells, three populations of energized mitochondria have been identified, namely a belt capping the secretory granules, a ring surrounding the nucleus, and a string lining the plasma membrane (19.Park M.K.

The intricate localization of Ca2+ signaling complexes and intracellular organelles is likely to be critical for the precise operation of the Ca2+ signaling apparatus and for regulated exocytosis in acinar cells. These assumptions can be directly examined only by testing the effect of perturbation of the cellular architecture on pancreatic acinar cell function. This has been a difficult problem to address but has now become possible with the availability of Mist1 null (Mist1–/–) mice (26.Pin C.L. Rukstalis J.M. Johnson C. Konieczny S.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Mist1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is essential for the normal development of serous acinar cells in various secretory glands, including the pancreas and salivary glands (26.Pin C.L.

Additional changes in Mist1–/– cells include up-regulation of mRNA coding for the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors and down-regulation of expression of IP3R3 (26.Pin C.L. Rukstalis J.M. Johnson C. Konieczny S.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, the effect of distorted cellular architecture on Ca2+ signaling, pancreatic function, and animal growth and development has not been examined. In the present work we show that the Ca2+ signaling machinery in Mist1–/– cells is dramatically altered, resulting in aberrant agonist-evoked Ca2+ oscillations and Ca2+ waves. The altered Ca2+ response is not due to mislocalization of the remaining IP3 receptors but rather is a consequence of mislocalization and aberrant Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria. The Golgi apparatus of Mist1–/– cells is diffuse and fragmented, which may explain the markedly decreased digestive enzyme content in the secretory granules. Exocytosis by Mist1–/– acinar clusters is undetectable at physiological agonist concentrations and is greatly reduced at pharmacological agonist concentrations. Remarkably, food consumption and weight gain remain similar for WT and Mist1–/– mice. These findings provide experimental evidence for the importance of cellular architecture in the generation and propagation of Ca2+ signals and illustrate the spare capacity of the exocrine pancreas to allow normal growth at reduced exocytosis. Materials—Carbachol, CCK, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were purchased from Sigma. IP3 was from Alexis. Fura2/AM, MitoTracker Green, Rhod-2, and Fluo-3 were from Teff Labs. Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) was from Molecular Probes. Dr. Akihiko Tanimura (University of Hokkaido, Japan) generously provided anti-IP3R1, IP3R2, and IP3R3 polyclonal antibodies. Anti-PMCA mAb 5F10 was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents. Anti-mannosidase II polyclonal antibodies were obtained from the University of Georgia. The polyclonal antibody against SERCA2b was provided by Dr. Frank Wuytack (University of Leuven, Belgium). Anti-M3 receptors antibodies were from US Biological. Experimental Animals, Body Weights, and Food Intake—Mist1–/– mice were generated as described previously (26.Pin C.L. Rukstalis J.M. Johnson C. Konieczny S.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). All animals were housed in the animal care facility, and all protocols were approved by the University of Texas Medical Center at Dallas Animal Care Committee and conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. WT and Mist1–/– mice were housed individually. Food intake was measured three times per week using an Ohaus portable electronic scale with a sensitivity of 0.1 g. The body weight of litter mates was measured on the day of birth and then at 1-week intervals. Preparation of Pancreatic Acini—Pancreatic acini and small acinar clusters were prepared by collagenase digestion as detailed previously (31.Shin D.M. Zhao X.S. Zeng W. Mozhayeva M. Muallem S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After isolation, the cells were suspended in solution A (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), 10 mm glucose, 0.1% mm bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor) and kept on ice until used. [Ca2+]i Imaging—Pancreatic acinar cells were loaded with Fura2, and [Ca2+]i was imaged as described (32.Shin D.M. Luo X. Wilkie T.M. Miller L.J. Peck A.B. Humphreys-Beher M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44146-44156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In brief, to measure the dose response for agonists the Fura2 fluorescence ratio was measured at excitation wavelengths of 350 and 380 nm, and the ratio was calibrated to obtain [Ca2+]i. Ca2+ waves were recorded using a single excitation wavelength of 380 nm. The image of resting cells was acquired and taken as the fluorescence signal at time 0 (F0). All subsequent images were divided by this image, and the traces and images are the calculated Ft/F0, where Ft is the fluorescence at time t. Simultaneous Measurement of Cytosolic and Mitochondrial Ca2+— Rhod-2 and Fluo-3 were used for the measurement of mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca2+ signals, respectively. Loading with Rhod-2 was achieved by incubating acini is solution A with 8 μm Rhod-2/AM at 4 °C for 15 min. The acini were washed by centrifugation for 2 min at 30 × g to remove excess dye and then resuspended in solution A. The acini were incubated at room temperature for 30 min to hydrolyze the trapped Rhod-2. During this incubation, the acinar suspension was supplemented with 4 μm Fluo-3/AM. Finally, the acini were washed with solution A and kept on ice until use. Dye-loaded cells were transferred to a perfusion chamber, and Fluo-3 and Rhod-2 fluorescence was measured with a confocal laser-scanning system from Bio-Rad (MRC-1024) using the 488- and 568-nm lines, respectively. Laser intensity was reduced to 1–3% with neutral density filters to reduce photo bleaching. Images were recorded at a frequency of 1 Hz. The images were analyzed using MetaMorph software. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Mitochondrial membrane potential was estimated from the incorporation of the potential-sensitive dye TMRM. Preliminary experiments showed that when monitored continuously, even at 1 μm the extent of TMRM incorporation was proportional to the mitochondrial membrane potential. TMRM uptake was measured by continuously perfusing acinar cells with a solution containing 1 μm TMRM. Once a plateau was reached, the acini were perfused with dye-free medium and then with medium containing 10 μm carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone. TMRM fluorescence was recorded with the 488-nm line of the Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope. Measurement of IP3—IP3 levels were measured by a radioligand assay as described elsewhere (33.Luo X. Popov S. Bera A.K. Wilkie T.M. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 651-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Acini suspended in solution A and incubated at 37 °C were stimulated with the indicated CCK or carbachol concentrations for 5–15 s, depending on agonist concentration. The reactions were stopped by the addition of perchloric acid, vigorous mixing, and incubation on ice for at least 10 min to allow precipitation of proteins. The supernatants were collected and transferred to clean tubes. Standards of IP3 were prepared in the same manner. The perchloric acid was removed and IP3 extracted by the addition of 0.15 ml of Freon and 0.15 ml of tri-n-octylamine. IP3 content in the aqueous phase was measured by displacement of [3H]IP3 using microsomes prepared from bovine brain cerebella. RT-PCR Analysis of CCK and M3 Receptors Expression—Acinar cell digests were placed in a Petri dish, and small clusters consisting of 3–5 cells were collected with a Pasteur pipette under microscopic examination to ensure lack of contamination with other cell types. The RNA was extracted from the acinar cells and brains of WT and Mist1–/– mice with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. RT-PCR was performed using the same amount of RNA isolated from three WT and three Mist1–/– mice. The RT reaction was performed with the SuperScript™ II RT kit (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction volume as suggested by the manufacturer. PCR primers were designed using Primer 3 version 0.2 and alignment by NCBI BLAST software. The primer sequences used were as follows: CCKA receptor sense, 5′-TCAGTGACCTCATGCTTTGC-3′, and CCKA receptor anti-sense, 5′-ATGAGTCCGTAAGCCACCAC-3′ (size of PCR product, 442 bp); muscarinic receptor 3 sense, 5′-TGCTGGTGATCAGCTTGAC-3′, and muscarinic receptor 3 antisense, 5′-TTCGTGCCTTGCTGTTGTAG-3′ (size of PCR product, 427 bp); β-actin-sense, 5′-TGTTACCAACTGGGACGACA-3′, and β-actin antisense, 5′-TCTCAGCTGTGGTGAAG-3′ (size of PCR product, 392 bp). The PCR reaction was initiated by a 5-min hot start at 94 °C followed by 35 amplification cycles that consisted of 50 s of incubation at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, extended by 10 min at 72 °C, and terminated by incubation at 4 °C. Preliminary experiments using different amounts of cDNA were used to determine the optimal conditions, and amplification of actin mRNA was used to calibrate between samples. Immunoblotting—Brain microsomes were prepared by homogenizing brain tissue from WT and Mist1–/– mice in a buffer containing (pH 7.6 with KOH) 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-base, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer, and the microsomes were stored at –80 °C until use. The microsomes were extracted by a 1-h incubation on ice with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 6.8 with HCl), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA and 0.5% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 15 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm benzamidine). Released proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to 0.2-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the membranes were then blocked by a 1-h incubation at room temperature in 5% nonfat dry milk in TTBS solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. The IP3R1, IP3R2, IP3R3, PMCA, SERCA2b, and M3 receptors were detected by a 1–2-h incubation of individual membranes with the respective antibodies diluted in TTBS. Immunocytochemistry—Immunostaning was performed as detailed previously (31.Shin D.M. Zhao X.S. Zeng W. Mozhayeva M. Muallem S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 32.Shin D.M. Luo X. Wilkie T.M. Miller L.J. Peck A.B. Humphreys-Beher M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44146-44156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Frozen pancreatic sections were fixed and permeabilized with 0.5 ml of cold methanol for 10 min at –20 °C. The sections were washed with phosphate-buffered saline alone and phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 mm glycine, and the nonspecific sites were blocked by a 1-h incubation with PBS containing 5% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% gelatin. The medium was aspirated and replaced with 50 μl of blocking medium containing control serum or a 1:10 dilution of antibodies against the M3 muscarinic receptor (M3R), IP3R2, and IP3R3 and a 1:1000 dilution of antibodies against mannosidase II. After incubation with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and three washes with the incubation buffer, the antibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG tagged with fluorescein or rhodamine. Images were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. Measurement of Amylase, Lipase, and Trypsin—Freshly isolated acini from one mouse were suspended in 50 ml (for amylase) or 15 ml (for lipase and trypsin) of solution A. To measure total enzyme activity, 1 ml of cell suspension was lysed by the addition of 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged for 2 min at 2000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. A second sample was used to measure protein content. Enzyme activity was measured in parallel from WT and Mist1–/– mice. To reduce variation due to feeding schedule, the mice were fasted for 24 h before the preparation of acini, and the results are expressed as the ratio between the activities in WT/Mist1–/– cells. For the measurement of exocytosis, portions of the 1.5-ml cell suspension were transferred to vials containing agonists to give the desired final concentrations. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, samples were transferred to Eppendorf tubes, the supernatants were separated from the acini by centrifugation, and the amylase released to the medium was measured. In each experiment, samples of cells were lysed to measure the total amylase content, and exocytotic amylase release was calculated as a fraction of total amylase content. Amylase activity was measured with a Phadebas kit (Pharmacia and Upjohn Diagnostics, catalog number 10-5380-33) as described previously (34.Zhao X.S. Shin D.M. Liu L.H. Shull G.E. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2680-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In brief, 10-μl samples were diluted into 200 μl of buffer containing 20 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm Na2HPO4, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.0. 20 μl of the diluted samples were mixed with 1 ml of blue starch (10 mg/ml) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 250 μl of 2 m NaOH, the supernatant was cleared by 5 min of centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, and the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 595 nm. Lipase activity was measured using para-nitrophenyl palmitate as a substrate (35.Gupta N. Rathi P. Gupta R. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 311: 98-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Samples of 0.1 ml were added to 2.4 ml of a freshly prepared para-nitrophenyl palmitate solution (30 mg of para-nitrophenyl palmitate in 100 ml of 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.5, 207 mg of Na+-deoxycholate, and 100 mg of gum arabic) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.2 ml of 100 mm CaCl2, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min, and the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 410 nm. Trypsin activity was determined with the substrate N-α-benzoyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide as described previously (36.Gildberg A. Overbo K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1990; 97: 775-7782Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Samples of 100 μl were added into 2.4 ml of 1 mm substrate N-α-benzoyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide dissolved in a solution containing 100 mm Tris, pH 9.0, and 10 mm CaCl2 and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The reactions were stopped by addition of 5 μl of 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and the change in absorbance at 410 nm was monitored. Statistics—When appropriate, results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of the indicated number of experiments. Statistical significance was evaluated by a two-way analysis of variance. All immunostaining experiments were repeated at least five times with similar results. Impaired Stimulation of Ca2+Signaling in Mist1–/–Cells— The up-regulation of the CCK receptor mRNA in Mist1–/– mouse pancreatic acinar cells (26.Pin C.L. Rukstalis J.M"
https://openalex.org/W2055198406,"A large fraction of the newly translated polypeptides emerging from the ribosome require certain proteins, the so-called molecular chaperones, to assist in their folding. In Escherichia coli, three major chaperone systems are considered to contribute to the folding of newly synthesized cytosolic polypeptides. Trigger factor (TF), a ribosome-tethered chaperone, and DnaK are known to exhibit overlapping co-translational roles, whereas the cage-shaped GroEL, with the aid of the co-chaperonin, GroES, and ATP, is believed to be implicated in folding only after the polypeptides are released from the ribosome. However, the recent finding that GroEL-GroES overproduction permits the growth of E. coli cells lacking both TF and DnaK raised questions regarding the separate roles of these chaperones. Here, we report the puromycin-sensitive association of GroEL-GroES with translating ribosomes in vivo. Further experiments in vitro, using a reconstituted cell-free translation system, clearly demonstrate that GroEL associates with the translation complex and accomplishes proper folding by encapsulating the newly translated polypeptides in the central cavity formed by GroES. Therefore, we propose that GroEL is a versatile chaperone, which participates in the folding pathway co-translationally and also achieves correct folding post-translationally.

Recent advances in the mechanistic understanding of chaperones have resulted in their classification into two major groups: “holder” and “folder” chaperones. The “holder” chaperones, such as trigger factor (TF) 1The abbreviations used are: TF, trigger factor; TC, translation complex; RT, reverse transcription; RF, release factor.1The abbreviations used are: TF, trigger factor; TC, translation complex; RT, reverse transcription; RF, release factor. and DnaK, associate with nonnative proteins and thereby prevent their misfolding and irreversible aggregation (1Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar, 2Bukau B. Deuerling E. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 119-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The “folder” chaperones, such as GroEL-GroES, not only bind nonnative proteins but also complete their folding with the aid of GroES and ATP. It is generally thought that the holder chaperones act co-translationally, whereas the folder chaperones act post-translationally (2Bukau B. Deuerling E. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 119-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 3Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Although this classification is not absolute (e.g. DnaK also stabilizes the newly synthesized polypeptides post-translationally), post-translational involvement of the eubacterial GroEL-GroES has been suggested in recent years on the basis of several in vitro and ex vivo analyses (4Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 5Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U.

Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The discovery of overlapping co-translational functions for TF and DnaK originated from the finding that their simultaneous deletion causes synthetic lethality (7Teter S.A. Houry W.A. Ang D. Tradler T. Rockabrand D. Fisher G. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1999; 97: 755-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 8Deuerling E. Schulze-Specking A. Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Bukau B. Nature. 1999; 400: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). However, recent genetic analyses confirmed that this lethality is abrogated either by growth at low temperature or by overproduction of GroEL-GroES (9Vorderwülbecke S. Kramer G. Merz F. Kurz T.A. Rauch T. Zachmann-Brand B. Bukau B. Deuerling E. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10Genevaux P. Keppel F. Schwager F. Langendijk-Genevaux P.S. Hartl F.U. Georgopoulos C. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The latter strongly suggests that GroEL substitutes for TF and DnaK by interacting co-translationally with newly translated peptides. A previous study demonstrated that a translating ribosome contains GroEL in addition to TF and DnaK (11Hesterkamp T. Hauser A. Lütcke H. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), although another study reported that the translating ribosome does not bind to GroEL (12Gaitanaris G.A. Vysokanov A. Hung S.C. Gottesman M.E. Gragerov A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These conflicting reports prompted us to reevaluate the interaction of GroEL with nascent polypeptides on ribosomes using different methodological approaches. Moreover, since a subset of proteins relies on GroEL for folding (6Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 13Horwich A.L. Low K.B. Fenton W.A. Hirshfield I.N. Furtak K.

Nature. 1998; 392: 139Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), it remains to be determined how GroEL-dependent substrates rapidly recognize and associate with the chaperonin in the vast cytosol. It is especially unclear how this process is regulated under conditions of DnaK and TF double deletion, since these proteins play an important role in the co-translational folding pathway. Although in principle in vivo approaches provide a better reflection of the actual working of chaperones in the cell, they present inherent difficulties in distinguishing different chaperone-assisted folding pathways co- or post-translationally (12Gaitanaris G.A. Vysokanov A. Hung S.C. Gottesman M.E. Gragerov A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Hardesty B. Tsalkova T. Kramer G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, a highly controllable translation-folding coupled system is urgently needed to determine the precise role of each chaperone in the co- and/or post-translational folding processes. To elucidate the involvement of individual chaperones during the translation process, an optimal solution would be the addition of chaperones to a “chaperone-free” translation system. However, complete removal of chaperones and other related factors from a cell-free system are intrinsically difficult because all conventional translation systems use cell extracts in some form (5Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 17Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16597-16601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To address this issue, instead of employing widely used cell lysates, here we utilize a well defined cell-free translation system, named PURE that only contains essential Escherichia coli factors responsible for protein synthesis (18Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokokawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 19Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Ueda H. Ueda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The absence of all endogenous chaperones provides ideal conditions for identifying substrates that strictly require GroEL-GroES and for elucidating the individual steps of protein folding that are controlled by GroEL. Plasmids and Proteins—The genes encoding target proteins were subcloned from the genome of E. coli strain A19, into the pET20b vector, by using the NdeI and BamHI (or EcoRI) restriction sites. The plasmid pKY206, bearing the GroEL and GroES genes, was kindly provided by Dr. Koreaki Ito. Molecular chaperones (DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, GroEL, GroES, and TF), their corresponding antibodies, and IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates were all sourced commercially or prepared as described previously (19Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Ueda H. Ueda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). GroEL(D398A) was purified as described (20Taguchi H. Ueno T. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 19: 861-865Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The antiserum to E. coli ribosomal protein L18 was prepared against purified L18 protein. Isolation of Translating Ribosomes from Growing Bacteria—Cells in exponential growth were harvested and extracted according to the method of Flessel et al. (21Flessel C.P. Ralph P. Rich A. Science. 1967; 158: 658-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kohler R.E. Ron E.Z. Davis B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 36: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Mg(OAc)2 was substituted for MgSO4 to restore magnesium concentration. Also, the lysing medium for preparing cytoplasmic extracts was adjusted slightly and comprised the following: 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Brij 58, 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 20 unit/μl DNase I, 50 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6). After the crude lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was carefully decanted and analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Cell-free Translation—Transcription-translation coupled cell-free translation of target proteins was performed for 1 h, following which the productivity and solubility of synthesized proteins were evaluated by autoradiographic analysis, as previously described (19Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Ueda H. Ueda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After in vitro transcription, mRNA was treated with DNase I and purified as described previously (23Ying B.W. Suzuki T. Shimizu Y. Ueda T. J. Biochem. 2003; 133: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Single round translation using previously purified mRNA was carried out at 37 °C for 10-15 min. The final concentration of magnesium was decreased to 6 mm, and the release factors were omitted in the single round reaction. The ratio of GroEL to ribosome was ∼1:15 to 1:5. Enzyme Assay—Adenosylmethionine synthetase activity was assayed using a standard protocol (24Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell-free translation reaction was stopped by the addition of puromycin (19Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Ueda H. Ueda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The translation mixture was subsequently added to the assay mixture, containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and 1.2 mm l-[methyl-14C]methionine (55 mCi/mmol; ARC), and a real time filter assay was performed using Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper. The amount of the catalytic product, adenosyl[14C]methionine, bound to the filter was determined by immersing it in scintillation mixture (22Kohler R.E. Ron E.Z. Davis B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 36: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and reading in a liquid scintillation counter (ALOKA). The ratio of the maximal rate of 14C-labeled adenosylmethionine synthesis to the soluble amount of the cell-free translated product was calculated as the relative biological activity of the enzyme. Precipitation and Western blot Analysis—Samples collected from the sucrose density gradient centrifugation were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, followed by alternate washing with diethyl ether (for dehydration) and acetone. The final precipitates were dissolved and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed to detect the presence of the chaperones and the ribosome protein L18 using appropriate antibodies, as described previously (19Ying B.W. Taguchi H. Ueda H. Ueda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Preparation of Translation Complexes—Single round translation was quenched by the addition of an equal volume of chilled translation buffer. The resultant mixture was immediately loaded onto a cold, 11-ml, linear sucrose gradient (10-50%) in standard buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 6 mm Mg(OAc)2, 30 mm NH4Cl, 1 mm spedimine, 8 mm putrescine, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol), following which it was ultracentrifuged in a rotor SW41Ti (35,000 rpm, 4 h). Upon layering of the mixture by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, it was portioned using a piston gradient fractionator (Towa), and the fraction was monitored at 254 nm in a continuously recording spectrophotometer (ÄKTA; Amersham Biosciences). The fractionated samples were automatically collected in a 96-well UV plate (Corning) with a fraction collector (Gilson). Immunoprecipitation of Translating mRNAs and RT-PCR—Commercially available magnet beads containing covalently bound sheet anti-mouse IgG (DynabeadsR M-280; Dynal) were coated overnight with the mouse anti-GroEL monoclonal antibody at 4 °C and subsequently blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline to reduce nonspecific binding in subsequent specific isolation steps. The single round translation reaction was quenched on ice as described above. The translation mixture was then co-incubated with the anti-GroEL-bound magnet beads at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing the beads with Tris-buffered saline three times, the bound translation complex was released by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm. The mRNAs in the washed and the eluted fractions were isolated as described previously (22Kohler R.E. Ron E.Z. Davis B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 36: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was carried out using a RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) with a pair of universal primers containing the T7 promoter sequence at the 5′-end or the T7 terminator sequence at the 3′-end. GroEL and GroES Are Associated with Nascent Polypeptides in Vivo—Initially, we examined whether the ribosome undergoing translation is associated with GroEL in growing E. coli cells. Ribosomes were isolated from cytoplasmic extracts prepared from the cells in the exponential growth phase using a sucrose density gradient centrifugation protocol, and the components in the various fractions were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1). The protein content of each loaded ribosome fraction was normalized to the level of ribosomal protein L18, which is present in the 50 S, 70 S, and polysome fractions but absent in the 30 S fraction. The polysomal ribosome fraction contained all three major chaperone systems: TF, DnaK, and GroEL-GroES. Their ribosomal binding may occur via the nascent polypeptide, since the addition of a translation inhibitor, puromycin, which releases translating polypeptides from the ribosome, abolished the interaction between the ribosome and these chaperones. This puromycin-sensitive association of GroEL with the ribosome suggests that GroEL plays a co-translational role in the folding of nascent polypeptides, similar to the known “holder” chaperones (TF and DnaK). However, this interpretation has a potential pitfall. Despite the observed puromycin sensitivity, we could not completely rule out the possibility that it was nascent GroEL polypeptides, rather than GroEL attached to the nascent polypeptide, that we detected by Western blotting, since growing E. coli is known to constitutively translate chaperones (e.g. ∼1% of total protein is GroEL). Thus, to confirm that GroEL associates with the ribosome through nascent polypeptides, we employed an in vitro translation system (the PURE system), which is reconstituted with minimal translation components and exogenous chaperones. GroEL-GroES Is Essential for Functional Folding of MetK—In focusing on the role of GroEL in translation, we developed the rationale that the folding of target polypeptides in the translation process is strictly GroEL-dependent, such that these are defined as stringent substrates. According to previous reports (6Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 15McLennan N. Masters M.

When the influence of major chaperone systems (DnaK and GroEL systems) on the solubility of these newly synthesized proteins was explored, the addition of chaperones increased the proportion of translation products in the soluble fraction. Among these proteins, products of the metK and dapA genes, which were highly dependent on GroEL-GroES, were considered as potential GroEL-GroES substrates in translation-coupled folding. Indeed, the addition of GroEL markedly suppressed the aggregation of these proteins during translation (data not shown). metK is a structural gene for adenosylmethionine synthetase, which consists of a tetramer of identical 42-kDa subunits (24Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Misaki S. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 136-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Since its enzymatic activity can be easily measured, we used MetK as the subject of further investigations.Table IChaperone dependency of target proteinsGenesProteinsMolecular massChaperone-freeChaperone dependency (solubility)ProductivitySolubilityDnaK/J-GrpEGroEL/ESBoth systemskDaeno2-Phosphoglycerate dehydratase (enolase)47+++a+++, ++, +, −, and ND mean high, medium, low, no dependency and not determined, respectively.++++/−−+/−gadAGlutamate decarboxylase53+++++++gatDGalactitol-1-phosphate 5-dehydrogenase38+++++/−+tdhThreonine-3-dehydrogenase35++++−+metF5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase33+++++++++metKS-Adenosylmethionine synthetase42++++++++++++gatYd-Tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase31+++++++++dapADihyodipicolinate synthetase38++++++++++tpiATriosephosphate isomerase27++++++/−−+thiDPhosphomethyipyrimidine kinase29+++++/−+uppUracil phosphoribosyltransferase20+++++++/−−−rpoADNA-directed RNA polymerase α36+++++−−−mdhMalate dehydrogenase33++++NDNDNDzwfGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase56+++++++−+ldhAd-Lactate dehydrogenase36++++++−−+dldd-Lactate dehydrogenase65++++++NDNDNDmalEMaltose-binding protein (double mutant)41+++++++/−+folADihydrofolate reductase18+++++−−−a +++, ++, +, −, and ND mean high, medium, low, no dependency and not determined, respectively. Open table in a new tab Both the DnaK and GroEL systems increased the solubility of translated MetK, although GroEL did so more effectively (Fig. 2A). When the translation-coupled folding of MetK was evaluated by analysis of its enzymatic activity, we found that the folding of MetK was remarkably GroEL-GroES-dependent (Fig. 2B). In the presence of GroEL-GroES, MetK folding was ∼12 fold higher than that observed in the absence of chaperones, with this effect being ATP- and GroES-dependent. In contrast, the addition of the DnaK system failed to enhance the enzymatic activity, although it did result in increased solubility. This result clearly demonstrated that GroEL-GroES assistance is essential for the production of MetK in its native state. GroEL Assists the Folding of MetK in the Cavity Formed by GroES—The direct association between MetK and GroEL was investigated by native PAGE. Cell-free translated products, into which [35S]methionine was incorporated, were loaded onto native gradient (5∼10%) gels. Several bands with different mobility were observed when translation was performed in the presence of either GroEL or GroEL-GroES (Fig. 2C). We confirmed that all of these radiolabeled bands were derived from full-length MetK polypeptides by analyzing excised bands under two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (data not shown). In addition, the observed mobility of purified recombinant MetK and the GroEL tetradecamer further clarified the locations of the native tetramer MetKN and the GroEL-MetK complex. Other bands were assigned as an intermediate (possibly a MetKI dimer) and a denatured MetKU form. In the absence of GroES, neither the native form nor the intermediate appeared. The enzyme assay results were consistent with the PAGE data, confirming that both GroEL and its co-chaperonin GroES were necessary to produce newly synthesized MetK in its native state (data not shown). Since it is well known that the ATP turnover cycle of wild-type GroEL has a duration of ∼10 s, we employed a mutant form of GroEL, GroEL(D398A), that can assist protein folding in a similar manner to wild-type GroEL but hydrolyzes ATP very slowly (less than ∼2% of the rate of wild-type GroEL) (29Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 30Ueno T. Taguchi H. Yadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), in order to extend the lifetime of the GroEL-MetK complex. As expected, levels of the GroEL-MetK complex greatly increased in the presence of GroEL(D398A). The direct association of MetK with GroEL and the strict requirement of GroES for MetK folding led us to test whether MetK polypeptides are actually encapsulated inside the GroEL-GroES cavity. The most reliable method for testing this hypothesis is the protease protection assay, in which the encapsulated protein was protected from the proteinases outside the GroEL-GroES cavity (31Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Cell-free translation was performed in the presence of GroEL (D398A) alone or with GroEL (D398A) and GroES together, respectively. The resultant translation products were subsequently digested with proteinase K. Proteins synthesized in the presence of GroEL alone were completely digested by the proteinase K, whereas those synthesized in the presence of both GroEL and GroES were resistant to proteinase K (Fig. 2D). The native MetKN and intermediate MetKI forms of the protein also survived proteinase K attack, which probably reflects their stable tight conformation. This indicated that the newly translated MetK is encapsulated into the GroEL-GroES cavity. GroEL Is Associated with the Translation Complex in a Cell-free System—To verify binding of GroEL toward polypeptides emerging on ribosomes in vitro, a single-round cell-free translation system, in which all release factors (RFs; RF1, -2, and -3 and RRF) were omitted, was employed. The metK mRNA transcribed in vitro was subjected to a single round cell-free translation of 10-15 min, following which the translation mixture was layered onto a sucrose gradient and centrifuged to isolate the translation complex (TC) (Fig. 3A). GroEL was clearly detected by Western blot analysis in the ribosomal fraction (Fig. 3B). It was abundantly expressed in the 30 S ribosome fraction, reflecting the similar sedimentation constants of the 30 S ribosome and the GroEL tetradecamer. Strikingly, GroEL was also observed in the same fractions as the translating ribosomes, namely the monosomal (70 S) and polysomal (X2, X3) fractions. In contrast, in the control experiment in which mRNA was omitted, GroEL was undetectable in the 70 S ribosomal fraction, confirming the reliability of the immunodetection methods. The presence of GroEL in translating ribosome fractions confirms the in vivo analysis (Fig. 1), which indicated that GroEL interacts with nascent peptides. To obtain more solid evidence that GroEL complexes with TC through nascent peptides, the mRNA in GroEL-bound TC was evaluated in a series of experiments shown in Fig. 3C. The metK mRNA was translated in a RF-free translation system and was amplified by RT-PCR after immunoprecipitation of the GroEL-bound TC using anti-GroEL-coated beads. RT-PCR indicated that metK mRNA was extensively amplified when the translation was performed in the presence of GroEL, but it scarcely accumulated in the eluted fraction and was only faintly amplified when translation was performed in the absence of GroEL (Fig. 3D). It appeared that without GroEL, the TC comprising the translating mRNA was almost entirely washed away during the wash steps. Obviously, these observations further indicated that GroEL is associated with the TC, thereby confirming its co-translational participation. Overproduction of GroEL-GroES Increases the Solubility of MetK in Vivo—Finally, the requirement of GroEL for the in vivo folding of MetK was investigated in E. coli. The plasmids pKY206 (groEL/ES) and pETMAT (metK) were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) separately or simultaneously. In brief, in vivo expression of metK alone resulted in only half of the MetK protein being soluble (Fig. 4A), whereas co-expression of metK and groEL/ES in cells markedly increased its solubility (up to ∼100%), confirming that MetK critically depends on GroEL-GroES for its maintenance. Furthermore, translating ribosomes were isolated from cells in which MetK was overexpressed (corresponding to Fig. 4A, left lanes of S and P) and analyzed by Western blotting. Using this approach, the association of GroEL with translating ribosomes (Fig. 4B, monosome and polysome) was again verified clearly (Fig. 4C). Here, we provide in vivo and in vitro evidence for the co-translational involvement of the chaperonin, GroEL, in the folding of emerging polypeptides on ribosomes. Our model for co-translational involvement of GroEL is illustrated schematically in Fig. 5. In this model, GroEL or GroEL-GroES binds to the nascent peptide on the ribosome probably at its apical domain, thereby preventing the aggregation and/or misfolding of emerging polypeptides. After termination of translation, full-length proteins can be encapsulated with the aid of ATP and GroES and folded in the cavity of the GroEL-GroES complex. Currently, it is unclear whether GroES participates in this pathway before or after the peptide release from ribosomes. In comparison with its co-translational addition, the post-translational addition of GroEL to the cell-free translation system was rather inefficient in preventing the aggregation of newly synthesized proteins (data not shown). Furthermore, in preliminary experiments, the addition of GroEL and GroES increased the rate of MetK translation, whereas GroEL alone had little effect on translational productivity. This result confirms the co-translational involvement of the GroEL-GroES system in the protein folding pathway as well as implying a co-translational role for GroES in this process. This model may provide a plausible explanation as to how and why the GroEL-GroES system compensates in the co-translational folding process under conditions in which the TF/DnaK systems are double-deleted. Moreover, GroEL is essential for cell viability, suggesting that these chaperones are required for quality control of nascent proteins in cells. It is likely that GroEL plays a pivotal role in the co-translational folding pathway in which DnaK and TF are involved, at least in the case of stringent substrates. We used an essential protein, MetK, as a model to study the involvement of an essential molecular chaperone, GroEL, in its folding. Of course, here we demonstrated only that GroEL-GroES attached the nascent peptides on ribosomes to conduct the proper folding of active subunits. MetK is composed of four identical subunits. The oligomerization, which is not the issue we addressed in this paper, may take place spontaneously in consequence of the emergence of the active monomers. Although MetK was previously identified as a GroEL-associated protein (6Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), its GroEL-GroES-dependent folding had never been studied. In vitro experiments using a reconstituted translation system and the exogenous addition of individual chaperones revealed that MetK is a stringent substrate of GroEL-GroES and that GroEL-GroES participates not only in preventing its aggregation but also in enhancing its folding. This role of GroEL-GroES is definitely coupled with the translation process and is crucial for tetramer formation, thereby endowing MetK with enzymatic activity. It was known that metK is an essential gene (26Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Langen H. Goloubinoff P. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and since here we found that GroEL-GroES is strictly required for the maturation of its product MetK, GroEL must be indispensable for cell viability. In contrast, the DnaK system increased the solubility of MetK but failed to facilitate its folding, which is consistent with the observation that deletion of DnaK does not induce cellular lethality. We assume that the results obtained in this study point to GroEL-GroES as being an essential factor in cells, and they also provide an explanation for the growth survival observed upon overexpression of GroEL-GroES in vivo. The hypothesis that GroEL interacts with polypeptides only after the termination of translation is based on reconstituted biochemical analysis (4Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), in which the sequential actions of the DnaK and GroEL systems were revealed, as well as on the architecture of the GroEL-GroES complex, which indicates that GroES caps the GroEL cage for substrate encapsulation. Here, using the PURE system, we identified a co-translational interaction between GroEL and its stringent substrate MetK and observed GroEL to be present as a complex with nascent polypeptides released from ribosomes in a puromycin-dependent manner. Although GroEL needs its co-chaperonin, GroES, to accomplish the effective folding of arrested nonnative proteins, emerging polypeptides could be held co-translationally by GroEL alone. The Group II eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC/CCT was reported to bind de novo polypeptides in a co-translational manner (33Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 34Thulasiraman V. Yang C.F. Frydman J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 35McCallum C.D. Do H. Johnson A.E. Frydman J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 149: 591-601Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Other than the existence of co-factors, Group I (eubacterial GroEL family) and Group II chaperonins resemble each other structurally, suggesting that they would have similar potential to associate with nascent polypeptides. Moreover, co-translational folding in prokaryotes is considered somewhat unlikely given that bacterial translation occurs at a higher rate than the eukaryotic process (5Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 17Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A.S. J. Biol.

Comparison of the endogenous GroEL concentration in the prokaryotic cytosol with that of TRiC in eukaryotes reveals that GroEL is much more abundant than TRiC in cells, although both chaperonins assist in folding a similar amount of proteins (39Dunn A.Y. Melville M.W. Frydman J. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although the translation speed in prokaryotes (15-20 residues/s) (36Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 37Lorimer G.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 38Netzer J.W. Hartl F.U. Trends Biochem.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 39Dunn A.Y. Melville M.W. Frydman J. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the concentration of GroEL (∼3 μm) (14Ewalt K.L. Hendrick J.P. Houry W.A. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1997; 90: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 37Lorimer G.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) is ∼10-fold higher than that of TRiC (0.3-0.5 μm) (34Thulasiraman V. Yang C.F. Frydman J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 39Dunn A.Y. Melville M.W. Frydman J. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Indeed, our in vitro translation experiments, in which 0.1-1 μm GroEL was present, strongly suggested the interaction of GroEL with the growing polypeptide on the ribosome. Thus, the post-translational participation of GroEL that was proposed previously on the basis of its limited cytosolic concentration might warrant reconsideration. In addition, if only one GroES molecule binds to GroEL, one of the two polypeptide binding regions in GroEL remains accessible. Therefore, in this model, the interaction between GroEL and a nascent polypeptide on the ribosome would not be hindered. Of the more than 4000 proteins encoded on the E. coli genome, there is little information on the relationship between substrates and their chaperones. For example, how are natural proteins identified and subjected to distinct folding pathways? Which features of the natural substrates are recognized by each chaperone? How many proteins are folded with the assistance of GroEL-GroES co- or post-translationally? Clearly, many questions still remain. Nevertheless, we believe that the combination of the reconstituted system and in vivo approaches will provide a technology platform for the genome-wide screening of stringent chaperone-dependent substrates and will significantly contribute to the elucidation of chaperone networks and their roles in cell maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W1971705479,"Candida albicans is an important fungal pathogen of immunocompromised patients. In cell culture, C. albicans is sensitive to mycophenolic acid (MPA) and mizoribine, both natural product inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH). These drugs have opposing interactions with the enzyme. MPA prevents formation of the closed enzyme conformation by binding to the same site as a mobile flap. In contrast, mizoribine monophosphate, the active metabolite of mizoribine, induces the closed conformation. Here, we report the characterization of IMPDH from wild-type and MPA-resistant strains of C. albicans. The wild-type enzyme displays significant differences from human IMPDHs, suggesting that selective inhibitors that could be novel antifungal agents may be developed. IMPDH from the MPA-resistant strain contains a single substitution (A251T) that is far from the MPA-binding site. The A251T variant was 4-fold less sensitive to MPA as expected. This substitution did not affect the kcat value, but did decrease the Km values for both substrates, so the mutant enzyme is more catalytically efficient as measured by the value of kcat/Km. These simple criteria suggest that the A251T variant would be the evolutionarily superior enzyme. However, the A251T substitution caused the enzyme to be 40-fold more sensitive to mizoribine monophosphate. This result suggests that A251T stabilizes the closed conformation, and this hypothesis is supported by further inhibitor analysis. Likewise, the MPA-resistant strain was more sensitive to mizoribine in cell culture. These observations illustrate the evolutionary challenge posed by the gauntlet of chemical warfare at the microbial level. Candida albicans is an important fungal pathogen of immunocompromised patients. In cell culture, C. albicans is sensitive to mycophenolic acid (MPA) and mizoribine, both natural product inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH). These drugs have opposing interactions with the enzyme. MPA prevents formation of the closed enzyme conformation by binding to the same site as a mobile flap. In contrast, mizoribine monophosphate, the active metabolite of mizoribine, induces the closed conformation. Here, we report the characterization of IMPDH from wild-type and MPA-resistant strains of C. albicans. The wild-type enzyme displays significant differences from human IMPDHs, suggesting that selective inhibitors that could be novel antifungal agents may be developed.

Amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, azoles, and echinocandins are currently used to treat candidiasis, although toxicity, limited availability, and the emergence of resistance create an urgent need for new drugs (3Sanglard D.

In addition, the IMPDH gene IMH3 is a useful genetic marker for C. albicans because multiple copies confer MPA resistance (7Kohler G.A. White T.C. Agabian N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MPAR, an IMH3 allele encoding an MPA-resistant IMPDH, confers drug resistance with a single gene copy (8Staib P. Kretschmar M.

A second MPA-resistant allele of C. albicans IMPDH that carries mutations I47V, S102A, and G482D has been reported, although the functional effects of these mutations on enzyme activity have not been characterized (11Goshorn A.K. Scherer S. Genetics. 1989; 123: 667-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Beckerman J. Chibana H. Turner J. Magee P.T. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). IMPDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step in guanine nucleotide metabolism: the oxidation of IMP to XMP with concomitant reduction of NAD+ (Fig. 1). IMPDH is a target for the immunosuppressive drugs mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept®) and mizoribine; the active metabolites of these drugs are MPA and mizoribine monophosphate, respectively (Fig. 1) (13Wu J.C. Perspect. Drug Discov. Des. 1994; 2: 185-204Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 14Ishikawa H. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 575-597PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of the IMPDH reaction is complex, with important consequences for inhibitor selectivity (Fig. 1). IMPDH undergoes a large conformational change in mid-catalytic cycle that converts the enzyme from a dehydrogenase to a hydrolase (15Gan L. Seyedsayamdost M.R. Shuto S. Matsuda A. Petsko G.A. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the first half of the reaction, substrates bind, and hydride transfer occurs to form the covalent E·XMP* intermediate. NADH departs, and the mobile flap folds into the NADH site. This conformational change positions the conserved Arg-Tyr dyad to activate water, and E-XMP* is hydrolyzed to XMP (16Guillén Schlippe Y.V. Riera T.V. Seyedsayamdost M.R. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4511-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). MPA traps E-XMP* by competing with the flap for the NADH site (18Link J.O. Straub K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2091-2092Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Sintchak M.D. Fleming M.A. Futer O. Raybuck S.A. Chambers S.P. Caron P.R. Murcko M. Wilson K.P. Cell. 1996; 85: 921-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In contrast, mizoribine monophosphate (MZP) binds to the IMP site and induces the flap to close (15Gan L. Seyedsayamdost M.R. Shuto S. Matsuda A. Petsko G.A. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, the equilibrium between open and closed conformations controls drug sensitivity: the open conformation favors MPA binding, whereas the closed conformation favors MZP binding. To explore the potential of C. albicans IMPDH as a chemotherapeutic target and to understand the mechanism of MPA resistance, we have characterized the wild-type enzyme as well as the enzyme encoded by MPAR. The MPAR enzyme contains a single substitution (A251T) that is outside of the MPA-binding site. Here, we show that this mutation stabilizes the closed conformation, causing MPA resistance, but increasing MZP sensitivity.

Several colonies appeared that were streaked onto uridine-containing synthetic dextrose medium plus a higher concentration of MPA (10 μg/ml). Two strains (EC3 and EC5) that were able to grow on elevated MPA concentrations were isolated. Assuming that a mutant IMH3 allele confers MPA resistance to strains EC3 and EC5, we amplified the entire coding regions of the IMH3 genes plus the flanking regions of both strains with the primer pair IMH3RXF (5′-GATTAGAATTCTCTAGATGTTTATGATAC-3′, with the introduced restriction sites in boldface) and IDHBXR (5′-GTATTGGATCCTCTAGAACTCAGTATATC-3′). Two IMH3 libraries of PCR products derived from the respective strains were generated by cutting the amplicon with EcoRI and BamHI, followed by cloning into pBluescript (Stratagene). The inserts were released using EcoRI and BamHI and used in two separate transformations of C. albicans strain CAI4. Both transformations yielded MPA-resistant C. albicans clones, thereby confirming our hypothesis that a mutant IMH3 allele confers MPA resistance. We re-amplified the IMH3 genes from two MPA-resistant C. albicans clones (EC352 and EC551) using the IMH3RXF/IDHBXR primer pair and cloned the amplicons into pBluescript, yielding pEC352 and pEC551, respectively. We sequenced both plasmid inserts derived from clones EC352 and EC551 and found that they contain the same point mutations. The sequence of the MPA-resistant IMH3 allele MPAR has been deposited in the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank with the accession number AY864854. Generation of IMH3 Mutants—A heterozygous imh3/IMH3 mutant was generated using the URA3 flipper method (20Morschhäuser J. Michel S. Staib P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) in C. albicans strain CAI4. For this purpose, plasmid pI4F was constructed by amplification of a 2.7-kb DNA fragment containing the IMH3 gene plus the flanking regions using the IMH3RXF/IDHBXR primer pair, followed by insertion of the EcoRI/BamHI-cut amplicon into pBluescript. Subsequently, the SalI and NotI restriction sites of pI4F were removed. The resulting plasmid was used as template for divergent PCR with primers KOIMHS (5′-CAGGGACGACTGGTCGACNRN2RN3RNCCCGGGAGAAATGGGAATGGGTAG-3′) and NIMHKO (5′-TAATTGCGGCCGCTGCAGNWN3WN2SNGCATGCCCAAGGTGTCTCTGGTTC-3′), which introduced new SalI and NotI sites (underlined), respectively. (Degenerate regions of the primers were used to tag strains for a different study.) After a NotI/SalI restriction digest, the amplicon was ligated to the NotI/XhoI URA3 flipper cassette of pSFU1 (20Morschhäuser J. Michel S. Staib P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), resulting in pSFI-MH3. The gel-purified ApaI/SacI fragment of pSFIMH3 containing the URA3 flipper with the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of IMH3 was used for targeted IMH3 gene disruption in strain CAI4. C. albicans strain CAI4 was transformed by electroporation as described previously (7Kohler G.A. White T.C. Agabian N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on uracil-deficient synthetic dextrose medium (yeast nitrogen base, complete supplement mixture without uracil, 2% glucose, and 2% agar) and subsequently tested for correct insertion of the disruption cassette by Southern analysis of genomic DNA (data not shown). For this study, we used the heterozygous Ura+imh3/IMH3 mutant Cl1M7 to generate mutants with a single copy of MPAR substituted for IMH3. This was achieved by introducing the MPAR mutation into strain Cl1M7 via transformation with a PCR fragment amplified from pEC352 using primers IMHSF (5′-GCTCCGTCGACTAGATGTTTATGATAC-3′) and IDHCLAR (5′-GCATGGCATCGATGGAAC-3′). MPA-resistant Ura+ transformants were selected on uracil-deficient synthetic dextrose medium plus 10 μg/ml MPA, and the MPAR mutation was verified by restriction digest (G-to-A transition in MPAR eliminates an Fnu4HI site) and direct sequencing of PCR products. Two transformants (MPAR1 and MPAR2) were chosen for further testing. Susceptibility Testing—The MPA and mizoribine resistance of C. albicans strains was measured quantitatively in a microtiter plate assay as described previously (7Kohler G.A. White T.C. Agabian N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth of the strains in synthetic medium in the presence of serial dilutions of the inhibiting substances was determined by A560 measurements after 48 h using a microplate reader. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Recombinant Expression of C. albicans IMPDH and MPAR—Both the IMH3 gene (7Kohler G.A. White T.C. Agabian N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and MPAR contain an intron at amino acid 150, which would prevent bacterial expression. Therefore, we isolated poly(A)+ RNA from strains CAI4 and EC3 using an Oligotex mRNA mini kit (Qiagen Inc.). Reverse transcription was carried out with Superscript II (Invitrogen) and primer DTNOT (5′-AATTCGCGGCCGCT17-3′). The cDNAs were amplified using the primer pair CA5CDS (5′-CGGCGGAATTCATGGTGTTTGAAACTTCAAAAG-3′) and CACDS3 (5′-TGGAACTGCAGTTAGTTGTGTAATCTCTTTTC-3′), which span the start and stop codons of the IMPDH genes, respectively. The PCR products were cut with EcoRI and PstI using the restriction sites introduced by the PCR primers and cloned into pUC18, resulting in pUCCDS4 (IMH3) and pUCCDS9 (MPAR). These inserts were subsequently amplified using primers 5TGCDS (5′-Pi-TGGTGTTTGAAACTTCAAAAG-3′) and CDS3HIND (5′-TGGTCAAGCTTAGTTGTGTAATCTCTTTTCATA-3′) to introduce a HindIII restriction site for cloning into pTACTAC (21Muchmore D.C. McIntosh L.P. Russell C.B. Anderson D.E. Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 177: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). pTACTAC was digested with NdeI, and the resulting ends were filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and further digested with HindIII. The blunt end ligation at the NdeI site regenerated the ATG start codon of IMH3 and MPAR, and the 3′-ligation regenerated a TAA stop codon. The ligation products were transformed into E. coli strain H712, a guanine auxotroph harboring a guaB– mutation. Cells were plated on modified M9CA minimal medium (10 g/liter M9 minimal salts (Invitrogen), 17 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 g/liter casamino acids, 0.79 g/liter complete supplement mix, 1 g/liter thiamine, 2 g/liter glucose, 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 50 mg/liter ampicillin) to isolate transformants correctly expressing the IMH3 or MPAR plasmid and complementing the guaB– mutation. For further studies, we used plasmids pTAC1_5 and pTAC4_13, which express wild-type IMH3 and MPAR IMPDHs, respectively. The sequences of both plasmid inserts were determined and proved free of errors. Protein Purification—E. coli H712 cells harboring either the pTAC1_5 or pTAC4_13 vector were cultured in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to express wild-type and A251T IMPDHs, respectively. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). All of the following manipulations were performed at 4 °C. The cells were disrupted by sonication. Debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to a Cibacron blue-agarose column (Sigma) previously equilibrated with buffer A. IMPDH was eluted in a linear gradient of 0–1 m KCl in buffer A. Fractions containing IMPDH activity were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and dialyzed overnight against buffer A containing 0.5 mm IMP. IMPDH was further purified on an HQ anion exchange column using a BioCAD Sprint perfusion chromatography system (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Enzyme was eluted in a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The fractions containing IMPDH were pooled, dialyzed overnight against buffer A containing 0.5 mm IMP at 4 °C, and then applied to an HS cation exchange column. IMPDH was eluted in a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein concentration was measured using a NanoOrange® protein quantitation kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. This protocol produced ∼12 mg of purified protein from 1 liter of cell culture. Enzyme Kinetics—Standard IMPDH assays contained 100 mm KCl, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) (assay buffer). The production of NADH was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (ϵ = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1) using a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer. The concentrations of IMP and NAD+ were varied for Km determinations. Initial velocity data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1) and the uncompetitive substrate inhibition equation (Equation 2) using SigmaPlot software (SPSS Inc.), v=kcat[E][S]/(Km+[S])(Eq. 1) v=kcat[E]/(1+Km/[S]+[S]/Kii)(Eq. 2) where v is the initial velocity, kcat is the turnover number, Km is the Michaelis constant of IMP or NAD+, and Kii is the substrate inhibition constant. Steady-state parameters with respect to NAD+ were derived by first determining the apparent kcat values for the initial velocity versus IMP plots (Equation 1 for wild-type IMPDH and Equation 2 for A251T IMPDH) and replotting these values against the NAD+ concentration (Equation 2 for wild-type IMPDH and Equation 1 for A251T IMPDH). Similarly, the Km value for IMP was derived by first determining the apparent kcat values for the initial velocity versus NAD+ concentration plots using Equation 2 for wild-type IMPDH and Equation 1 for the mutant enzyme and replotting these values against the IMP concentration (Equation 1 for wild-type IMPDH and Equation 2 for A251T IMPDH). The kcat values determined by this method were similar to those determined above. Inhibitor Kinetics—The Ki values for MPA inhibition were determined in experiments containing constant IMP concentrations (600 μm for wild-type IMPDH and 200 μm for A251T IMPDH) and varied NAD+ concentrations. Initial velocity data were fit to the uncompetitive tight-binding inhibition equation (Equation 3) and the noncompetitive inhibition equation (Equation 4) using SigmaPlot software, v=(v0/(2[E]))⋅([E]−[I])−Kaap+(([E]−[I]−Kapp)2+4[E]Kaap))Kaap=Kii(1+Km/[NAD])(Eq. 3) v=Vmax[S]/(Km(1+[I])/Kis)+[S](1+[I]Kii))(Eq. 4) where v is the initial velocity; Vmax is the maximum velocity; S is substrate; Km is the Michaelis constant for the substrate; Kis and Kii are the slope and intercept inhibition constants, respectively; I is inhibitor; and E is enzyme. The best fits were determined by the relative fit error. MZP is a slow tight-binding inhibitor under standard assay conditions. The Ki value was determined from the steady-state inhibition data, and the kon and koff values were determined from progress curves, both analyzed using Dynafit (22Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). The analysis presumed that MZP is a competitive inhibitor with respect to IMP, as has been observed for IMPDH from other organisms. Multiple inhibition experiments with tiazofurin and ADP were performed with constant concentrations of IMP (600 μm for wild-type IMPDH and 200 μm for A251T IMPDH) and NAD+ (250 μm for wild-type IMPDH and 4000 μm for A251T IMPDH) at 25 °C in assay buffer. Data were fit to an equation describing multiple inhibition (Equation 5), v=v0/(1+[I]/Ki+[J]/Kj+[I][J]/αKiKj)(Eq. 5) where I and J are inhibitors; v0 is the initial velocity in the absence of inhibitors; α is the interaction constant; and Ki and Kj are the inhibition constants for I and J, respectively. Isolation of MPA-resistant Strains of C. albicans—Strain CAI4 is sensitive to MPA, with an MIC50 of 0.25 μg/ml. Electrocompetent C. albicans strain CAI4 was cultured in the presence of sub-lethal concentrations of MPA (3–5 μg/ml) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After prolonged incubation, several colonies appeared; cells were streaked onto agar plates with an increased concentration of MPA (10 μg/ml); and two strains were isolated (EC3 and EC5). The MIC50 values for both strains EC3 and EC5 as determined by microdilution assays were ∼1.7 μg/ml MPA (Supplemental Fig. S1). Identification of the MPAR Mutation—Assuming that a mutant IMH3 allele confers MPA resistance, we amplified the entire coding regions of the IMH3 genes plus the flanking regions of both strains EC3 and EC5. Transformation of strain CAI4 with these amplification products yielded MPA-resistant clones, confirming that drug resistance results from mutation(s) in IMH3. Isolation and sequencing of the IMH3 genes from these strains revealed several differences from the published nucleic acid sequence of the IMH3 gene from strain SS (7Kohler G.A. White T.C. Agabian N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With one exception, all sequence differences within the coding region were silent. The G-to-A transition at nucleic acid 751 of the IMH3 coding sequence creates an Ala-to-Thr substitution at position 251 of the protein sequence. The mutant IMH3 gene also lacks the 200-bp solo phi element in the 3′-untranslated region, a long terminal repeat of a putative transposable element of C. albicans. phi was recently described by Goodwin and Poulter (23Goodwin T.J. Poulter R.T. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 174-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We found that phi is present in one IMH3 allele of strains SC5314 and CAI4 (data not shown). Because neither SC5314 nor CAI4 shows MPA resistance similar to that shown by EC3 or EC5, we concluded that the phi element is not involved in MPA resistance. A single copy of the IMH3 gene carrying the A251T mutation could confer MPA resistance to C. albicans. This allele was subsequently developed as a dominant selection marker gene in Candida (8Staib P. Kretschmar M. Nichterlein T. Kohler G. Michel S. Hof H. Hacker J. Morschhäuser J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 533-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 10Wirsching S. Michel S.

Mycoses. 2002; 45: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic basis of the drug resistance of MPAR was unclear because Ala251, although well conserved among IMPDHs from different sources, is not located in the MPA-binding site. Characterization of Wild-type and A251T IMPDHs—Both the wild-type and MPAR alleles of C. albicans IMPDH were expressed in E. coli by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction using vector pTACTAC. Both constructs complement the guanine auxotrophy of E. coli strain H712, indicating that active IMPDHs were produced, and both enzymes were purified to >95% homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Supplemental Fig. S2). The wild-type enzyme displayed strong NAD+ substrate inhibition, which is generally attributed to formation of a nonproductive E-XMP*·NAD complex. Initial velocity data collected at saturating IMP concentrations suggested that the Km value for NAD+ is greater than the Kii value, which complicates determination of steady-state parameters. This observation was confirmed when both substrates were varied (Figs. 2 and 3). Therefore, the kcat and Km values should not be considered well determined. Nevertheless, it is apparent that the kinetic parameters for C. albicans IMPDH are significantly different from those for human IMPDH, which is promising for the development of specific inhibitors. The parameters for human IMPDH type II are shown in Table II for reference; the parameters for human IMPDH type I are very similar to those for human IMPDH type II (25Carr S.F. Papp E. Wu J.C.

IMP concentrations were varied in the presence of fixed NAD concentrations. For the wild-type enzyme, the Vmax values determined in Fig. 2 were plotted against the NAD concentration and fit to the equation describing uncompetitive substrate inhibition (Equation 2) to determine the values of Km for NAD and Vmax at saturating substrate concentrations. For the A251T enzyme, the Vmax values versus NAD data could be fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1) to determine the values of Km for NAD and Vmax at saturating substrate concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IISteady-state kinetic parametersParameterC. albicans IMPDHHuman IMPDH type IIWild-typeA251Tkcat (S-1)6 ± 14.6 ± 0.30.4Km(NAD) (μm)3500 ± 1800600 ± 3006Km(IMP) (μm)60 ± 4017 ± 34Kii(NAD) (μm)1500 ± 800NA590Kii(IMP) (μm)NANANAKis(IMP)vs. Kis(NAD) (μm)NA900 ± 200NA Open table in a new tab In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, A251T IMPDH did not exhibit NAD+ substrate inhibition (Figs. 2 and 3). Although the kcat value appears to be similar to that for the wild-type enzyme, the Km values for both substrates are significantly lower. Surprisingly, high concentrations of IMP inhibited the A251T IMPDH reaction. To our knowledge, this is the first report of IMP substrate inhibition in an IMPDH. This inhibition is competitive versus NAD. Inhibition of C. albicans IMPDHs—We determined the sensitivity of both C. albicans enzymes to well known IMPDH inhibitors. MPA is an uncompetitive inhibitor of IMPDHs from other sources (27Hedstrom L. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 545-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); it binds selectively to the E·XMP* intermediate in the nicotinamide end of the dinucleotide site (after NADH departs) (Fig. 1) (18Link J.O.

The Kii value is very similar to that of human IMPDH type II, which suggests that the drug-binding sites are also very similar in the fungal and human enzymes. MPA is also an uncompetitive inhibitor of A251T IMPDH. The Kii value is 4-fold higher than that for the wild-type enzyme, comparable with the increase in MIC50 observed in the growth of the MPAR strains. These results confirm that drug resistance results from the substitution of Ala251 with Thr.Table IIIInhibition constantsInhibitor (mechanism)C. albicans IMPDHHuman IMPDH type IIWild-typeA251TMPA (UC vs. NAD)Kii (nm)11 ± 444 ± 722fData taken from Ref. 42.Tiazofurin (NC vs. NAD)Kis (mm)26 ± 840 ± 101.3aData taken from Ref 17.Kii (mm)3.3 ± 0.39 ± 14.2aData taken from Ref 17.ADP (C vs. NAD)Kis (mm)34 ± 316"

They are typified by mutants of neuroserpin that are retained within the endoplasmic reticulum of neurons as ordered polymers in association with dementia. We show here that the S49P mutant of neuroserpin that causes the dementia familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB) forms a latent species in vitro and in vivo in addition to the formation of polymers. Latent neuroserpin is thermostable and inactive as a proteinase inhibitor, but activity can be restored by refolding. Strikingly, latent S49P neuroserpin is unlike any other latent serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) in that it spontaneously forms polymers under physiological conditions. These data provide an alternative method for the inactivation of mutant neuroserpin as a proteinase inhibitor in FENIB and demonstrate a second pathway for the formation of intracellular polymers in association with disease.

We have recently described an autosomal dominant dementia, FENIB, that is characterized by inclusions of mutant neuroserpin as Collins' bodies within cortical and subcortical neurons (11.Davis R.L.

Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Nature. 1999; 401: 376-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This dementia is unusual in that the inclusions result from the retention of ordered polymers of neuroserpin within the endoplasmic reticulum of neurons (4.Belorgey D. Crowther D.C. Mahadeva R.

Moreover, the number of inclusions is directly related to the rate of polymer formation and inversely proportional to the age of onset of dementia (4.Belorgey D. Crowther D.C. Mahadeva R. Lomas D.A.

For example, the Syracuse mutation (S49P) causes dementia in middle age, whereas the more rapidly polymerizing Portland mutant (S52R) causes more inclusions and an onset of dementia in the early twenties.

The polymers that form in FENIB are identical to those that are formed by a mutant of another member of the serpin superfamily, the Z variant of α1-antitrypsin (E342K), in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes in association with liver disease (15.Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). This common mechanism of disease has allowed us to group these conditions and others that result from polymerization of serpin mutants, angio-edema (C1-inhibitor), thrombosis (antithrombin), and emphysema (α1-antichymotrypsin), as the serpinopathies (18.Lomas D.A.

We have demonstrated that this is via an unstable intermediate M* (26.Dafforn T.R. Mahadeva R. Elliott P.R. Sivasothy P. Lomas D.A. J. Biol.

However, in serpins such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, antithrombin, and α1-antichymotrypsin population of M* can result in intramolecular loop insertion and an inert latent configuration (29.Lawrence D.A.

Other serpins, such as α1-antitrypsin and antithrombin, can also be induced to form the latent conformer by heating in stabilizing concentrations of sodium citrate (33.Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R.

This latent conformation cannot revert back to the stable species without incubation at high temperatures or refolding from denaturants (33.Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R. Chang W.-S.W. Wardell M.R.

Moreover, we demonstrate that the latent conformation can spontaneously form polymers under physiological conditions. These data demonstrate that latency is an alternative pathway for inactivation of mutant neuroserpin as a proteinase inhibitor as well as providing an additional pathway for the formation of polymers in vivo. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant wild-type neuroserpin (NS) and the S49P mutant of neuroserpin were expressed with a His6 tag at the N terminus and purified as described previously (4.Belorgey D.

After purification on HiTrap Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), the protein was purified on a UNO-Q6 column (Bio-Rad) with an NaCl gradient (0.02–1 m) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). The monomeric protein was then isolated by gel filtration using a Superpose 12HR column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). The resulting proteins were assessed by SDS and non-denaturing and transverse urea gradient PAGE, and activity was assessed against tPA (4.Belorgey D. Crowther D.C. Mahadeva R. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17367-17373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. Preparation of Latent Neuroserpin—Native NS or native S49P was incubated at 1 μg/ml and 55 °C for 24 h in PBS and then concentrated to 1–5 mg/ml at 4 °C with a Vivaspin concentrator (Vivasciene). The latent protein was purified with a Superpose 12HR column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS, concentrated with a Vivaspin concentrator, and then stored at –80 °C. The resulting proteins were assessed by SDS and non-denaturing PAGE. Assessment of Latent and Polymeric Neuroserpin by Non-denaturing and SDS-PAGE—1–2 μg of proteins were separated on a 7.5% w/v non-denaturing gel or 10% w/v SDS gel and then visualized by staining with GelCode Blue stain reagent (Pierce) or by silver staining. The density of bands was assessed by densitometry scanning with Quantity One (Bio-Rad) software. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (13.Miranda E. Römisch K. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28283-28291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were separated on a 7.5% w/v non-denaturing gel or 10% w/v SDS gel and then transferred onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). The blots were probed with 1/25,000 or 1/5000 rabbit polyclonal anti-neuroserpin antibody and 1/10,000 goat polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (horseradish peroxidase) (Sigma) and detected with an ECL SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate or a SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Circular Dichroism—CD experiments were performed using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter. The far-UV CD spectrum was recorded at 0.5 mg/ml protein and 10 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and the average of 20 traces was determined. The spectra were analyzed in terms of secondary structure content by a variable selection method with 43 reference proteins (36.Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 37.Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar). Thermal unfolding experiments were performed by monitoring the CD signal at 216 nm between 25 and 100 °C using a heating rate of 1 °C/min and a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in PBS. Melting temperatures were calculated using an expression for a two-state transition as described previously (26.Dafforn T.R. Mahadeva R. Elliott P.R. Sivasothy P. Lomas D.A. J. Biol.

Complex Formation Assays—NS, S49P, or Collins' body extraction was incubated with 1.7 μm tPA at 25 °C as described previously (4.Belorgey D. Crowther D.C. Mahadeva R. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17367-17373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Samples were taken at different time intervals, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mm 1,5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone (final concentration) to inhibit any free tPA (40.Renatus M. Engh R.A. Stubbs M.T. Huber R. Fischer S. Kohnert U. Bode W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4797-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The samples were then mixed with loading buffer, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored until the completion of the experiment. The samples for SDS-PAGE analysis were boiled for 3 min before loading onto the gel. Proteins were separated by 10% w/v SDS-PAGE or 7.5% non-denaturing PAGE and visualized by staining with GelCode Blue stain reagent (Pierce) or Western blot analysis. Refolding of Neuroserpin—Native or latent neuroserpin was denatured at 0.1 mg/ml and 37 °C for 30 min in 0.2 m HCl containing 9 m urea, pH 2.2, and then diluted with a 30-fold volume of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. The proteins were allowed to refold at 4 °C for 8 h and then concentrated with a Vivaspin concentrator at 4 °C. Preparation of Collins' Bodies Extraction—Collins' bodies were isolated from the brain of a patient with FENIB as detailed previously (11.Davis R.L. Shrimpton A.E. Holohan P.D. Bradshaw C. Feiglin D. Collins G.H. Sonderegger P. Kinter J. Becker L.M. Lacbawan F. Krasnewich D. Muenke M. Lawrence D.A. Yerby M.S. Shaw C.M. Gooptu B. Elliott P.R. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Nature. 1999; 401: 376-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were treated with Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mg/ml protease inhibitor mixture, pH 8.0) containing 1% v/v Triton X-100 and sonicated at 1 °C for 3 min. The tissue suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant was dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C for 5 h with a Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette (Pierce). This extraction process had no effect on the conformation of purified recombinant native, latent, and polymeric S49P at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml (data not shown). Thus the extraction process did not interfere with the analysis of neuroserpin from Collins' bodies. The protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. Neuroserpin Forms Polymers and a Latent Species in Vitro— Incubation of NS at 1.0 mg/ml and 45 °C in PBS resulted in the formation of polymers (Fig. 1a, right) as described previously (4.Belorgey D. Crowther D.C. Mahadeva R. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17367-17373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 12.Belorgey D. Sharp L.K. Crowther D.C. Onda M. Johansson J. Lomas D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3360-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These polymers dissociated to monomeric protein following heating in SDS in keeping with a non-covalent reactive loop-β-sheet A linkage (Fig. 1a, left). However, after prolonged incubation, a faster migrating band was apparent on the non-denaturing gel (arrow). The intensity of this band increased if the polymerization experiments were performed at low concentrations of NS (Fig. 1b), whereas at higher concentrations, the polymerization reaction prevailed. Incubation of NS at 10 μg/ml and 55 °C resulted in the formation of almost pure monomeric neuroserpin that migrated as the lower band on non-denaturing PAGE (Fig. 1b). This same monomeric conformer was also formed by incubation of native S49P at 1 μg/ml and 55 °C (data not shown) and incubation of both NS and S49P under physiological conditions at 37 °C (Fig. 1c). S49P formed the new conformer more readily than wild-type protein at 37 °C as assessed by densitometry scanning analysis. S49P and NS were completely transformed to the new conformer after 48 and 120 h, respectively (Fig. 1c). Characterization of Latent Neuroserpin—The faster migrating species was prepared by heating native NS or S49P at 1 μg/ml and 55 °C in PBS for 24 h. It was then purified by gel filtration (Fig. 1b) and analyzed by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2a). There were differences in the far-UV CD profile consistent with an increase in β-structure upon transformation of the native form into a latent species. On secondary structure prediction based upon deconvolution of these spectra, latent NS had 4% less α-helices and 14% more β-strands than native NS, and latent S49P had 4% less α-helices and 9% more β-strands than native S49P. The latent conformer of NS was inactive as a proteinase inhibitor against the target enzyme tPA (Fig. 2b) under conditions in which native NS formed a characteristic SDS-stable complex. Similarly, the latent species of S49P, prepared under the same conditions as NS, was inactive against tPA, whereas native S49P formed a stable complex (Fig. 2b). The cardinal feature of latent serpins is the restoration of the native species and inhibitory activity following refolding (35.Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Refolding of urea-denatured latent NS resulted in a species that had the same migration profile as native NS (Fig. 2c). Likewise, refolding of urea-denatured latent S49P also resulted in a species with the same electrophoretic mobility as native S49P on non-denaturing PAGE (data not shown). Refolding of urea-denatured latent NS or latent S49P resulted in a restoration of inhibitory activity as demonstrated by the ability of the refolded species to once again form an SDS-stable complex with tPA (Fig. 2b). Taken together, these data show that both NS and S49P can form an inactive latent species and that this species can be reactivated by refolding. Stability of Latent Neuroserpin—Previous studies have shown that latent serpins are more stable than their native equivalents. Latent NS and latent S49P were therefore assessed by transverse urea gradient PAGE (Fig. 3a). The upper gels clearly showed that latent NS was more stable than native NS. In contrast, there was no significant difference between latent S49P and native S49P (lower gels). Stability was also assessed by measuring the melting temperature (Tm) of each of the conformers by monitoring the change in CD signal at 216 nm. The Tm values of native NS and native S49P were 56.6 ± 0.3 and 49.9 ± 1.2 °C, respectively (4.Belorgey D. Crowther D.C. Mahadeva R. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17367-17373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), whereas those of latent NS and latent S49P were 89.4 ± 0.4 and 61.6 ± 0.5 °C, respectively (Fig. 3b). It was striking that the melting temperature of latent S49P was much lower than that of latent NS. Polymers formed from either native NS or native S49P did not melt at temperatures up to 100 °C. Polymerization of Latent Neuroserpin—The reactive loop is fully incorporated into β-sheet A in a latent serpin, and so it is unable to accept the loop of another molecule to form polymers. In keeping with this, latent NS did not form polymers when incubated at 1 mg/ml and 45 °C for 24 h (Fig. 4a). Indeed, latent NS was resistant to polymer formation when incubated at a higher protein concentration (3 mg/ml) and a higher temperature (55 °C) for 48 h. In marked contrast, latent S49P formed polymers when incubated at 0.25 mg/ml and 37 °C (Fig. 4b). Latent S49P formed polymers less readily than native S49P but more readily than native NS when incubated under these physiological conditions (Fig. 4b). We have shown previously that heating α1-antitrypsin in 0.7 m sodium citrate at 67 °C forces it to adopt the latent conformer and to form short chain polymers (33.Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R. Chang W.-S.W. Wardell M.R. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5282-5288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Heating native NS or native S49P between 37 and 55 °C in 0.5 m citrate resulted in suppression of polymerization and slower formation of the latent conformer (Fig. 5, a and b). In contrast, latent S49P was able to form oligomers in the presence of citrate at temperatures ranging from 37 to 55 °C (Fig. 5c). These oligomers were not formed by heating latent NS in the presence of citrate (Fig. 5d). It is of interest that latent S49P also formed oligomers in the absence of citrate (Figs. 4b and 5c). They were formed even when this conformer was incubated at 55 °C. In contrast, incubation of native NS and native S49P in the same conditions resulted in the formation of long chain polymers and higher ordered aggregates. These results demonstrate that latent S49P can form polymers through a different pathway from either NS or S49P. Conformers of Neuroserpin in Collins' Bodies from Patients with FENIB—The observation that S49P forms the latent species under physiological conditions (Fig. 1c), and remarkably, that it can then polymerize (Fig. 4b), raised the question as to whether the latent conformer is present in inclusion (Collins‘) bodies in patients with FENIB. Collins’ bodies were isolated from the brain of an individual with FENIB as a consequence of the S49P neuroserpin mutation as described previously (11.Davis R.L. Shrimpton A.E. Holohan P.D. Bradshaw C. Feiglin D. Collins G.H. Sonderegger P. Kinter J. Becker L.M. Lacbawan F. Krasnewich D. Muenke M. Lawrence D.A. Yerby M.S. Shaw C.M. Gooptu B. Elliott P.R. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Nature. 1999; 401: 376-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then assessed by non-denaturing PAGE and Western blot analysis. In addition to polymers, a monomeric band was also detected in Collins' bodies that had the same migration profile as latent S49P (Fig. 6a, upper left and right). There was no evidence of reactive loop cleavage when neuroserpin from Collins' bodies was assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6a, lower left). It is difficult to compare the migration of neuroserpin from Collins' bodies with that of recombinant S49P as the later lacks carbohydrate side chains. The electrophoretic mobility of neuroserpin from Collins' bodies was therefore assessed in comparison with neuroserpin secreted by mammalian COS-7 cells transfected with S49P (13.Miranda E. Römisch K. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28283-28291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6a, in the lower left gel, neuroserpin from Collins' bodies had a molecular mass between that of recombinant protein and protein secreted by transfected COS-7 cells in keeping with the glycosylation expected as a result of retention within the endoplasmic reticulum (13.Miranda E. Römisch K. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28283-28291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, monomeric neuroserpin from Collins' bodies migrated more anodally on non-denaturing gels than both the native recombinant protein and the monomeric protein secreted from the cells (Fig. 6a, upper left). This is in keeping with neuroserpin within Collins' bodies adopting a latent conformation as well as forming polymers in vivo. The monomeric neuroserpin from Collins' bodies was inactive as a proteinase inhibitor when incubated with tPA (Fig. 6b). There was no difference in the electrophoretic migration of monomeric neuroserpin from Collins' bodies before and after treatment with tPA (Fig. 6b, lanes 11 and 12), and furthermore, there was no evidence of cleavage of the reactive center loop (Fig. 6b, lanes 4–6). These results demonstrate that the reactive loop of monomeric neuroserpin from Collins' bodies is inaccessible through formation of a latent species. The polymers identified from the Collins' bodies were a mix of both short and long chain polymers (Fig. 6a, upper right). This compares with only long chain polymers found in the medium from COS-7 cells transfected with S49P (Fig. 6a, upper left gel) (13.Miranda E. Römisch K. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28283-28291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and is in keeping with polymerization of latent S49P. Taken together, these observations provide strong support for the presence of latent S49P within the Collins' bodies of FENIB and are in keeping with a proportion of the polymers in Collins' bodies being formed by oligomerization of latent S49P. The serpinopathies result from conformational transitions of members of the serpin superfamily with aberrant tissue deposition or loss of function. They are best exemplified by point mutations of neuroserpin to cause the inclusion body dementia FENIB and the Z allele of α1-antitrypsin in association with hepatic inclusions and liver disease. Our previous work has defined the pathway of polymerization (Fig. 7, inside broken line). Point mutations in the shutter region (blue circle) allow the formation of an unstable intermediate (M*) that is characterized by inactivity, a raised melting temperature, and the rapid formation of polymers (27.Gooptu B. Hazes B. Chang W.S. Dafforn T.R. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Lomas D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci (U. S. A.). 2000; 97: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In some serpins, the population of M* results in the formation of a latent species in which the reactive loop is fully inserted into β-sheet A (41.Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46347-46354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Such a conformer is inactive as a proteinase inhibitor, thermostable, and cannot polymerize as the annealing site of β-sheet A is occupied. This species can only be induced to form polymers by denaturation and refolding to the native conformer (33.Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R. Chang W.-S.W. Wardell M.R. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5282-5288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 35.Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that wild-type neuroserpin can form both polymers and a latent species in vitro. Latent NS has 14% more β-strands than native NS (Fig. 2a), is thermostable (Fig. 3b), cannot polymerize (Fig. 4a), and is inactive as a proteinase inhibitor (Fig. 2b). The activity of latent NS can be restored by refolding (Fig. 2b). The formation of latent and polymeric NS is in keeping with the conventional pathway illustrated in Fig. 7, inside the broken line. The predominant species that forms depends upon protein concentration, with concentrated solutions favoring step 2 and the formation of polymers, whereas dilute solutions favor step 3 and latency. It is surprising that latent NS can be produced under physiological conditions (Fig. 1c). The only other serpin that is inactivated by spontaneous transition to a latent species is plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (35.Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both neuroserpin (2.Osterwalder T. Cinelli P. Baici A. Pennella A. Krueger S.R. Schrimpf S.P. Meins M. Sonderegger P. J.

However, the length of time required to form the latent conformer in vitro means that wild-type neuroserpin may be turned over at the synapse before the latent species forms in vivo. The Syracuse (S49P) mutation of neuroserpin is in the shutter domain (Fig. 7, blue circle). This mutant perturbs β-sheet A to allow the spontaneous formation of polymers that are retained as inclusion bodies in the cerebral cortex in association with dementia (4.Belorgey D. Crowther D.C.

Lancet. 2002; 359: 2242-2247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that this mutation also favors the formation of the latent conformer at low concentrations under physiological conditions (Fig. 1c). This transition, like that of polymerization, also serves to inactivate neuroserpin as an inhibitor of its target proteinase tPA (Fig. 2b). The importance of this finding is underscored by the finding of latent S49P in Collins' bodies isolated from patients with disease (Fig. 6). This inactivation of S49P will exacerbate the deficiency of neuroserpin at the synapse that arises from polymerization and the 100-fold decrease in inhibitory activity caused by the S49P mutation (4.Belorgey D. Crowther D.C. Mahadeva R. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17367-17373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These factors combine to increase the concentration of synaptic tPA, which may exacerbate the neuropsychiatric features of FENIB (10.Madani R. Kozlov S. Akhmedov A. Cinelli P. Kinter J. Lipp H.P. Sonderegger P. Wolfer D.P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 473-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 46.Bradshaw C.B. Davis R.L. Shrimpton A.E. Holohan P.D. Rea C.B. Fieglin D. Kent P. Collins G.H. Arch. Neurol. 2001; 58: 1429-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The most striking finding is that far from being inert (Fig. 2b), latent S49P spontaneously forms polymers under physiological conditions (Fig. 4b). Latent S49P has a Tm 27.8 °C lower, and less β-structure, than latent NS. Thus the reactive loop must be less stably incorporated into β-sheet A in latent S49P than it is in latent NS (Fig. 7, compare Lf and Lp). Thus we must now modify the pathways of latency and polymerization. Polymers may form via a back reaction as shown in steps 5 and 2 or directly as shown in step 6. Only latent S49P has the ability to form oligomers in the presence of 0.5 m citrate (Fig. 5), indicating that the second polymerization pathway from step 6 is distinct from that of step 2. The finding of oligomers of latent S49P in vitro and from Collins bodies in vivo highlights the importance of this second pathway in disease. It is currently not possible to define which pathway (either steps 5 and 2 or step 6) is most important in the polymerization of latent S49P in vivo. Nevertheless, the ability of latent S49P to polymerize will increase the burden of polymers within neurones and so exacerbate the neuronal dysfunction and death that underlie FENIB. The structure of the polymers that form from oligomerization of latent S49P (step 6) is unknown. It is recognized that citrate prevents the β-sheet A-linked polymerization of α1-antitrypsin (Fig. 7, step 2) (33.Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R. Chang W.-S.W. Wardell M.R. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5282-5288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and induces linkage via β-sheet C (47.Bottomley S.P. Hopkins P.C. Whisstock J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Indeed, polymerization of native NS and native S49P, which proceeds via β-sheet A, was suppressed by citrate (Fig. 5, a and b). The formation of the partially loop inserted latent species (Fig. 7, Lp) by S49P causes the liberation of strand 1C, which can then be replaced by the reactive loop of a donor molecule to form C-sheet polymers (42.Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Thus polymerization of latent S49P in the presence of citrate is consistent with the formation of polymers via a C β-sheet pathway. In summary, we have shown that S49P can be inactivated by both polymerization and the formation of a latent species in vivo. This latent conformer is unlike any other latent serpin in that it can spontaneously form polymers under physiological conditions. This allows us to extend the pathways of polymer formation within the serpinopathies and to further define the pathogenic conformers of neuroserpin that contribute to the dementia FENIB. We are grateful to Dr Richard L. Davis, State University of New York Health Science Center, Syracuse, New York for providing the Collins' bodies, Dr. Elena Miranda, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, for the culture medium from cells expressing S49P neuroserpin, and all members of the Lomas laboratory for helpful discussions."

To clarify the role of Stat3 in the G-CSF signaling pathway, we wished to identify target genes of Stat3.We found that the levels of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) α mRNA were up-regulated following G-CSF stimulation in 32Dcl3 but were unchanged in 32Dcl3/DNStat3. In addition, the activation of Stat3 augmented the function of C/EBPα, which is the essential transcriptional factor for myeloid differentiation. G-CSF-induced granulocytic differentiation was restored in 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells by the conditional expression of C/EBPα. These results show that one of the major roles of Stat3 in the G-CSF signaling pathway is to enhance the function of C/EBPα.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture, Expression Plasmid, and Cytokines—32D clone 3 (32Dcl3) and 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells (DNStat3 deletes the transactivation domain of Stat3) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (ICN, Osaka, Japan), penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), recombinant murine interleukin-3 (IL-3) (Kirin Brewery, Takasaki, Japan), and recombinant human G-CSF (Chugai Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan). 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine.For the construction of pTag2A-G-CSF receptor, the human G-CSF receptor cDNA (13.Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1990; 61: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) (pHQ3, kindly provided by S. Nagata and R. Fukunaga) was excited from the pBluescipt vector and inserted into the FLAG-tagged mammalian expression plasmid pCMV-Tag2A (Clontech). pcDNA3-rat C/EBPα was described before (14.Reddy V.A. Iwama A. Iotzova G. Schulz M. Elsasser A. Vangala R.K. Tenen D.G. Hiddemann W. Behre G. Blood. 2002; 100: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Stat3 cDNA was amplified by PCR and inserted into pCMV-HA vector (Clontech). Stat3c cDNA was elicited from RCMV-Stat3c (15.Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar), kindly given from Dr. Darnell, and inserted into pcDNA3.1 (Clontech). For the construction of pMY-IRES-GFP/C/EBPα-ER, full-length human C/EBPα cDNA was fused in-frame with ligand-binding domain (amino acids 281–599) of mouse estrogen receptor harboring a mutation (G525R) that confers selective responsiveness to 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT). A reporter construct of a minimal TK promoter with CEBP-binding sites (p(C/EBP)2TK) was described previously (14.Reddy V.A. Iwama A. Iotzova G. Schulz M. Elsasser A. Vangala R.K. Tenen D.G. Hiddemann W. Behre G. Blood. 2002; 100: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Murine recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor, natural IFN-α, and recombinant IFN-γ were purchased from Sigma, HyCult Biotechnology (Uden, The Netherlands), and Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ), respectively. For Western blotting, 32Dcl3 cells or 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells were deprived of IL-3 for 12 h. Then cells were stimulated with G-CSF (10 ng/ml), IL-3 (10 ng/ml), leukemia inhibitory factor (10 ng/ml), IFN-α (1,000 units/ml), or IFN-γ (1,000 units/ml) for 30 min.Microarray Analysis—32D cl3 and 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells maintained in IL-3 were washed twice with PBS and starved of cytokine in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 8 h and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml G-CSF. Total RNA was extracted, by the acid guanidinium method, from 32Dcl3 and 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells before or after the stimulation for 2 h with G-CSF. Double-stranded cDNA synthesized from the total RNA (20 μg/sample) was then used to prepare biotin-labeled cRNA for the hybridization with GeneChip MGU74Avs2 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) harboring oligonucleotides corresponding to ∼6000 known genes as well as ∼6000 expressed sequence tag sequences. Hybridization, washing, and detection of signals on the arrays were performed with the GeneChip system (Affymetrix).Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR Assay—32Dcl3 and 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells maintained in IL-3, were washed twice with PBS and starved of cytokines for 8 h and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml G-CSF. Cells were harvested at the indicated times, and total RNA was isolated using Isogen (Nippon gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of extracted RNA was transcribed in a 20-μl cDNA synthesis reaction using an RNA PCR kit (AMV) (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). Real-time PCR for C/EBPα, G-CSF receptor, lysozyme M, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin precursor (NGAL), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was performed by a TaqMan assay on an ABI 7000 system. PCR primers and probes were designed as follows: murine C/EBPα, sense, 5′-CCA TGT GGT AGG AGA CAG AGA CCT A-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTC TGG GAT GGA TCG ATT GTG-3′; probe FAM-5′-CGG CTG GCG ACA TAC AGT ACA CAC AAG-3′-TAMRA, and sense, 5′-CCA AGA AGT CGG TGG ACA AGA-3′, and antisense, 5′-CGG TCA TTG TCA CTG GTC AAC T-3′; probe FAM-5′-AGC ACC TTC TGT TGC GTC TCC ACG TT-3′-TAMRA; murine G-CSF receptor, sense, 5′-CTA AAC ATC TCC CTC CAT GAC TT-3′, and antisense, 5′-GGC CAT GAG GTA GAC ATG ATA CAA-3′; probe FAM-5′-CAT CTT CTC TGT CCC CAC CGA CCA A-3′-TAMRA; murine lysozyme M, sense, 5′-TGC CTG TGG GAT CAA TTG C-3′, and antisense, 5′-ATG CCA CCC ATG CTC GAA T-3′; probe 5′-FAM-CAG TGA TGT CAT CCT GCA GAC CA-TAMRA-3′; murine NGAL, sense, 5′-GGC CTC AAG GAC GAC AAC A-3′, and antisense, 5′-CAC CAC CCA TTC AGT TGT CAA T-3′; probe 5′-FAMCAT CTT CTC TGT CCC CAC CGA CCA A-TAMRA-3′, and murine GAPDH sense, 5′-ACG GCA AAT TCA ACG GCA-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGA TGG TGA TGG GCT TCC-3′; probe 5′-FAM-AGG CCG AGA ATG GGA AGC TTG TCA TC-TAMRA-3′. PCR amplifications were performed in a 50-μl volume, containing 4 μl of cDNA template, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl(pH 8.3), 10 mm EDTA, 60 nm, 200 μm dNTPs, 3 mm MgCl2, 200 nm each primer, 0.625 units of AmpliTaqGold, and 0.25 units of AmpErase uracil N-glycosylase. Each amplification reaction also contained 100 nm appropriate detection probe. Each PCR amplification was performed in duplicate, using conditions of 50 °C for 2 min preceding 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min). In each reaction, GAPDH was amplified as a housekeeping gene to calculate a standard curve and allow for the correction for variations in target sample quantities. Relative copy numbers were calculated for each sample from the standard curve after normalization to GAPDH by the instrument software.Conditional C/EBPα Expression—pMY-IRES-GFP/C/EBPα-ER was transfected into 32Dcl3 and 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells by electroporation. 5 × 106 cells were transfected with 20 μg of expression vector, and GFP-positive cells were sorted by FACS Vantage (BD Biosciences). Expression of C/EBPα was determined by Western blotting analysis (see below).Luciferase Assay—293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method in 6-well plates, and luciferase activity was assayed using a luminometer Lumat LB9507 (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each expression plasmid amount was 50–100 ng/well, and the same amount of empty expression vector was used as control, respectively. Results of reporter assays represent the average values for relative luciferase activity generated from five independent experiments.Flow Cytometry—1 × 107 cells were incubated with 5 μl of recombinant phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated rabbit anti-murine Gr1 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed twice in PBS, and analyzed on a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences).Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed with lysis buffer, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as described previously (8.Shimoda K. Feng J. Murakami H. Nagata S. Watling D. Rogers N.C. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Ihle J.N. Blood. 1997; 90: 597-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total cell lysates or the immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed using the indicated antibodies followed by an IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-phospho-Stat1 and -Stat5 antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and anti-Stat1, -Stat3, and -C/EBPα antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Membranes were probed using and visualizes with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences).Proliferation Assay—32D cl3 and 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells maintained in IL-3 were washed twice with PBS and starved of cytokine for 8 h and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml G-CSF. The number of viable cells was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion using a hemocytometer. [3H[Thymidine incorporation assays were also performed. Briefly, cells (1 × 105) in 100 μl of medium stimulated with murine IL-3 (1.0 ng/ml) or recombinant human G-CSF (10 ng/ml) were cultured for 48 h. During the final 4 h, [3H]thymidine (1μCi/well) was added. Cells were then harvested by filtration, and radioactivity was counted by scintillation spectrophotometer.RESULTSG-CSF-induced Intracellular Signal Response in 32Dcl3/DNStat3 Cells—32Dcl3 cells differentiate into neutrophils following treatment with G-CSF, but 32Dcl3 cells expressing a dominant-negative Stat3 (32Dcl3/DNStat3) proliferate following G-CSF treatment. These cells maintain immature morphologic characteristics without evidence of differentiation (11.Nakajima H. Ihle J.N. Blood. 2001; 98: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). First, we examined the effect of dominant-negative Stat3, carboxyl-truncated Stat3 that lacked 55 amino acids including the transactivation domain. We transfected reporter construct of STATt3-LUC, in which the α2-macroglobulin promoter (16.Aoki N. Matsuda T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 58-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) drives expression of the luciferase (LUC) reporter gene and G-CSF receptor, together with empty vector (pcDNA3) or DNStat3 to 293T cells. After 12 h of transfection, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml G-CSF. Cells were cultured for more 24 h, and luciferase assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 1A, G-CSF induced the transcriptional activity of Stat3 by 150-fold, and DNStat3 inhibited this G-CSF-induced Stat3 activation in a dose-dependent manner.G-CSF mainly induces the phosphorylation of Stat3, but it also phosphorylates Stat1 and Stat5 in some cells among the Stats family (8.Shimoda K. Feng J. Murakami H. Nagata S. Watling D. Rogers N.C. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Ihle J.N. Blood. 1997; 90: 597-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and induces the activation of MAP kinases. In both 32Dcl3 cells and 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells, neither Stat1 nor Stat5 was phosphorylated in response to G-CSF (data not shown). As for the MAP kinase activation, the degree of the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by G-CSF stimulation in 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells was stronger than that in 32Dcl3 cells (Fig. 1B).Identification of Genes Regulated by Stat3 in the G-CSF Signaling Pathway by Oligonucleotide Array Analysis—To identify Stat3-regulated genes involved in granulocytic differentiation, we compared gene expression change in both cell lines using microarray analysis. 32D cl3 and 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells maintained in IL-3 were washed twice with PBS and starved in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum lacking cytokine for 8 h and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml G-CSF. Total RNA was isolated from 32Dcl3 cells and 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells treated with G-CSF after 0 and 2 h, transcribed to biotin-labeled cRNA, and hybridized to GeneChip MGU74Av2 arrays to compare the expression profile of ∼12,000 murine genes. The fold induction in the expression level of each gene was calculated as the ratio of GAPDH-normalized fluorescence intensity value of G-CSF-stimulated cells when compared with those before G-CSF stimulation. As shown in Table I, we could identify a set of candidate genes for Stat3 targets, expression of which was up-regulated in 32D cl3 cells but down-regulated or unchanged in 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells. Such Stat3-dependent expression profiles were confirmed in triplicate experiments.Table IMicroarray analysisGene product nameAbbreviationAccession numberFold induction32Dcl332Dcl3/DNStat3B-cell leukemia/lymphoma αBcl2L3153235.60.0629CyclinE1Ccne1NM00763329.70.690Serotonin-gated ion channel5HT3M7442527.20.592KIF3B proteinkif3bD2607721.50.921Protein kinase, serine/arginine-specific 1Srpk1AB01229018.70.321MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine kinase 1Mknk1Y1109115.70.845Protein tyrosine phosphatasePtpn13D8396612.40.964Transferrin receptorTrfrX5734910.60.964Lymphocyte antigen 57Ly57AF0681829.620.968Macrophage stimulating 1 receptorMst1rX747368.830.762Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7MKK7AB0056548.140.980RAR-related orphan receptor alphaRoraU532287.940.861Hemoglobin Y, β-like embryonic chainHbb-yV007267.380.375Runt related transcription factor 1Runx1NM0098217.010.226Microtubule-associated protein 6Mtap6Y147545.060.885CCAAT/enhancer binding protein αC / EBP αM623622.050.840Ecotoropic viral integration site 1Evi1M218291.550.239Integrin alpha LItgalM607781.350.567Ninjurin 1Ninj1U915131.340.783Interleukin 17 receptorIL17RU319931.240.449Mucosal addressinMAdCAMD504341.140.527Carbon catabolite repression 4 homologCcr4X166701.060.0768Friend leukemia integration 1Fli1X594211.010.305 Open table in a new tab C/EBPα Is a Target Gene for Stat3 in G-CSF Signaling Pathway—Among the identified genes, it was decided to focus further efforts on C/EBPα. C/EBPα has been shown to be critical for early granulocytic differentiation (17.Radomska H.S. Huettner C.S. Zhang P. Cheng T. Scadden D.T. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4301-4314Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 18.Wang X. Scott E. Sawyers C.L. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 560-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Zhang D.E. Zhang P.

A. 1997; 94: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar), and the factors regulating its activity are unclear. The expression of C/EBPα was examined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. C/EBPα mRNA levels are rapidly up-regulated in 32Dcl3 cells, being elevated 2.39-fold after 6 h and 4.20-fold after 48 h (Fig. 2A). In contrast to 32Dcl3 cells, the C/EBPα mRNA levels were not changed in 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells after G-CSF stimulation (Fig. 2A). A similar expression pattern was seen in separate experiments with independently designed primers and probes (data not shown). Levels of C/EBPα mRNA were unaffected by cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 2B). The expression level of the sum of Stat3 plus dominant-negative Stat3 in 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells is a little larger than that of Stat3 in 32Dcl3 cells (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Expression of C/EBPα mRNA in G-CSF-stimulated 32Dcl3 and 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells.A and B, 32Dcl3 and 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells maintained in IL-3 were washed twice with PBS and starved of cytokines for 8 h and stimulated with 10 ng/ml G-CSF (A) or 10 ng/ml G-CSF and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (B). Total RNA was isolated from both cell lines at the indicated times and transcribed to cDNA, which was subjected to real-time PCR for murine C/EBPα. The numbers given on the vertical axis represent the fold induction of the ratios of GAPDH-normalized expression values when compared with those before G-CSF stimulation. Results are expressed as mean fold of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Activated Stat3 Binds to C/EBPα and Enhances the Transcription Activity of C/EBPa—We next examined the effect of Stat3 abrogation on the balance of intracellular signals in other cytokine pathways. Although Stat1 was not phosphorylated by leukemia inhibitory factor stimulation in neither 32Dcl3 cells nor 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells, its activation in response to IFN-γ occurred at the same degree in both 32cl3 cells and 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells (Fig. 3A). As for the Stat5 activation, the phosphorylation of Stat5 by IL-3 stimulation in 32Dcl3 cells was stronger than that in 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells (Fig. 3B). These data indicated that there was the possibility that abrogation of Stat3 signaling can alter the balance of intracellular signals in other cytokine signaling pathways. The transcription of C/EBPα is regulated by C/EBPα itself (20.Christy R.J. Kaestner K.H. Geiman D.E. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1735-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Then we examined whether activated Stat3 in G-CSF signaling enhance C/EBPα activity or not.Fig. 3The effect of the abrogation of Stat3 on other cytokine signaling pathway. 32Dcl3 cells or 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells were cultured with IL-3 and then deprived of IL-3 for 12 h. Cells were treated with the indicated cytokines for 30 min and lysed. Post-nuclear supernatants were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed using the indicated antibodies. LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We transfected a reporter construct of a minimal TK promoter with CEBP-binding sites (p(C/EBP)2TK), C/EBPα, and G-CSF receptor to 293T cells. After 12 h of transfection, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml G-CSF. Cells were cultured for more 24 h, and a luciferase assay was performed. C/EBPα up-regulated the C/EBPα-dependent gene expression, and the G-CSF stimulation enhanced this C/EBPα-dependent gene expression (Fig. 4A). Next we examined the effect of constitutive active Stat3 (Stat3C) on the augmentation of C/EBPα transcriptional activity instead of the G-CSF stimulation. We transfected reporter construct p(C/EBP)2TK, C/EBPα, and Stat3C to 293T cells. After 24 h of transfection, luciferase assay was performed. Stat3C augmented the C/EBPα-dependent gene expression, although Stat3C alone had no influence on the luciferase activity (Fig. 4, B and C).Fig. 4Activated Stat3 makes complex with C/EBPα, leading to the enhancement of C/EBPα-induced transcription.A, transient transfection in 293T cells with a reporter construct of a minimal TK promoter with CEBP-binding sites (p(C/EBP)2TK), C/EBPα, and G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR). Twelve hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml G-CSF. Promoter activity was measured as luciferase activity 36 h after transfection. The vertical axis number is the fold induction when compared with control. B and C, transient transfection in 293T cells with a reporter construct of a minimal TK promoter with CEBP-binding sites (p(C/EBP)2TK), C/EBPα, Stat3c, and control vectors. Promoter activity was measured as luciferase activity 24 h after transfection. The vertical axis number is the fold induction when compared with control. D, transient transfection in 293T cells with a construct of G-CSF receptor, HA-Stat3, and C/EBPα and control vectors. After 24 h, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti C/EBPβ. Cells were stimulated with G-CSF during the final 9 h in the culture. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Stat3 was detected by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As p(C/EBP)2TK contains only a C/EBPα-binding site and does not contain a Stat3-binding sequence, the possibility that Stat3C makes a complex with C/EBPα and augments the function of C/EBPα is raised. Then we transfected C/EBPα, Stat3, and G-CSF receptor to 293T cells and stimulated cells with G-CSF for 6 h. There is no detectable level of endogenous C/EBPα or C/EBPβ protein in 293T cells. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with C/EBPβ antibody (this antibody cross-reacts with C/EBPα). As shown in Fig. 4D, immunoprecipitants with anti-C/EBPβ contain Stat3. In addition, the complex formation between C/EBPα and Stat3 is augmented by G-CSF stimulation, indicating that activated Stat3 makes the complex with C/EBPα.C/EBPα Restores G-CSF-induced Granulocytic Differentiation in 32Dcl3/DNStat3 Cells—To analyze the role of Stat3-regulated C/EBPα function in the G-CSF signaling pathway, we transfected a C/EBPα-tamoxifen receptor fusion protein (C/EBPα-ER) into 32Dcl3 and 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells (32Dcl3/CEBPA cells, 32Dcl3/DNStat3/CEBPA cells, respectively). The expression of C/EBPα-ER in these cells was verified by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). C/EBPα-ER localizes to the cytoplasm and is in an inactive form in the absence of tamoxifen. Upon treatment with tamoxifen, it translocates from cytoplasm to nucleus and becomes active. 32Dcl3, 32Dcl3/CEBPA, 32Dcl3/DNStat3, and 32Dcl3/DNStat3/CEBPA cells were cultured with G-CSF in the presence or absence of tamoxifen, and cell proliferation was examined by both counting viable cells and [3H]thymidine incorporation. 32Dcl3/DNStat3 proliferated in response to G-CSF, and proliferation was not affected by the presence of tamoxifen. Conversely, G-CSF-induced proliferation of 32Dcl3/DNStat3/CEBPA cells in the presence of tamoxifen was dramatically reduced (Fig. 5, B and C).Fig. 5Prolife"
https://openalex.org/W1985786432,"Biogenesis of lysosomes depends in mammalian cells on the specific recognition and targeting of mannose 6-phosphate-containing lysosomal enzymes by two mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPR46, MPR300), key components of the extensively studied receptor-mediated lysosomal sorting system in complex metazoans. In contrast, the biogenesis of lysosomes is poorly investigated in the less complex metazoan Drosophila melanogaster. We identified the novel type I transmembrane protein lysosomal enzyme receptor protein (LERP) with partial homology to the mammalian MPR300 encoded by Drosophila gene CG31072. LERP contains 5 lumenal repeats that share homology to the 15 lumenal repeats found in all identified MPR300. Four of the repeats display the P-lectin type pattern of conserved cysteine residues. However, the arginine residues identified to be essential for mannose 6-phosphate binding are not conserved. The recombinant LERP protein was expressed in mammalian cells and displayed an intracellular localization pattern similar to the mammalian MPR300. The LERP cytoplasmic domain shows highly conserved interactions with Drosophila and mammalian GGA adaptors known to mediate Golgi-endosome traffic of MPRs and other transmembrane cargo. Moreover, LERP rescues missorting of soluble lysosomal enzymes in MPR-deficient cells, giving strong evidence for a function that is equivalent to the mammalian counterpart. However, unlike the mammalian MPRs, LERP did not bind to the multimeric mannose 6-phosphate ligand phosphomannan. Thus ligand recognition by LERP does not depend on mannose 6-phosphate but may depend on a common feature present in mammalian lysosomal enzymes. Our data establish a potential important role for LERP in biogenesis of Drosophila lysosomes and suggest a GGA function also in the receptor-mediated lysosomal transport system in the fruit fly.

Biogenesis of lysosomes plays an important role in many physiological and pathological processes. In mammals, it depends on the transport of soluble lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes by two integral type I membrane proteins, the mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPR) 1The abbreviations used are: MPR, mannose 6-phosphate receptor; MPR46, Mr 46.000 mannose 6-phosphate receptor; MPR300, Mr 300.000 mannose 6-phosphate receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; LERP, lysosomal enzyme receptor protein; MBP, maltose-binding protein; Man6P, mannose 6-phosphate; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; TGN, trans-Golgi network; UTR, untranslated region; LDL, low density lipoprotein; EST, expressed sequence tag. (1.Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Mannose 6-phosphate residues (Man6P) are known as a lysosomal sorting signal in mammals and are recognized by MPRs. Two mannose-6-phosphate receptors, MPR46 and MPR300, sort newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to endosomes in mammalian cells, where enzyme release is triggered by the acidic interior. From there, the enzymes are transported to the lysosomes. MPRs are recycled to the cell surface or carried back to the Golgi complex to undergo multiple rounds of sorting but never reach lysosomes. Defects in the Man6P marker synthesis found in patients with I-cell disease or deletion of the corresponding MPRs results in missorting of lysosomal enzymes to the extracellular lumen and consequently to the formation of storage lysosomes. The MPR300 is a multifunctional receptor made up of 15 contiguous domains. Besides Man6P-containing lysosomal enzymes, MPR300 binds and endocytoses a variety of ligands involved in embryogenesis, differentiation, immunity, cell proliferation, and cell migration such as insulin-like growth factors 2 (IGF2), proliferin, transforming growth factor-β precursor, leukemia inhibitory factor, renin precursor, granzymes A and B, Herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D, retinoic acid, plasminogen, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (for a review, see Ref. 2.Dahms N.

In mammals, the transport of MPRs is operated by sorting signals that are determined in the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors (4.Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Three different GGAs and additional splice variants exist in mammals that share functional similarities with tetrameric adaptor complexes (AP1–4) but are monomeric cytoplasmic adapter proteins that are recruited to the TGN by ARF1-GTPase. They consist of four distinct domains: a VHS domain that binds the acidic dileucine sorting signal (DXXLL) found in the MPRs and other transmembrane cargo proteins; the GAT domain, which interacts with the GTP-bound form of ARF1; a hinge region, which recruits clathrin; and a GAE domain, which exhibits sequence similarity to the ear region of γ adaptin and recruits a number of accessory proteins (Ref. 13.Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Cell Struct. Funct. 2003; 28: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar and references therein). The interaction with the GGAs leads to the selective incorporation of the MPRs into clathrin-coated vesicles destined for the endosomal/lysosomal sorting route. Mutations in the cytoplasmic domains of the MPRs that cause a loss in binding to the GGAs result in missorting and incomplete processing of lysosomal hydrolases (5.Glickman J.N. Conibear E. Pearse B.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 7.Klumperman J. Kuliawat R. Griffith J.M. Geuze H.J. Arvan P. J.

In yeast, two homologous GGA proteins exist that seem also to be involved in the receptor-mediated transport of lysosomal hydrolases to the vacuole, the equivalent of lysosomes (16.Black M.W. Pelham H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The vacuolar yeast-sorting receptor Vps10p represents the functional analog of the mammalian MPRs. However, it sorts its ligands by peptide recognition signals and not by carbohydrate recognition (17.Cereghino J.L. Marcusson E.G. Emr D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1089-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The vesicular sorting system for the intracellular vacuolar/lysosomal transport pathways is highly conserved between yeast and mammals (18.Dennes A. Madsen P. Nielsen M.S. Petersen C.M. Pohlmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12288-12293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Data on the biogenesis of lysosomes in Drosophila are rare, and no components of a receptor-mediated lysosomal transport system have been identified so far (20.Luzio J.P. Rous B.A. Bright N.A. Pryor P.R. Mullock B.M. Piper R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1515-1524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only the tetraspanin sun was recently identified as a lysosomal membrane protein in Drosophila photoreceptor cells (21.Xu H. Lee S.J. Suzuki E. Dugan K.D. Stoddard A. Li H.S. Chodosh L.A. Montell C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 811-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). With the exception of the aspartic acid proteinase carboxypeptidase 1, which may represent a homologous protein to mammalian cathepsin L, no other lysosomal enzymes, sorting receptors such as MPRs, or homologous proteins have been identified (22.Tryselius Y. Hultmark D. Insect Mol. Biol. 1997; 6: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here we report on the identification of a novel lysosomal enzyme receptor protein (LERP) from Drosophila melanogaster. Our results show that LERP rescues missorting of lysosomal enzymes in mouse fibroblasts deficient for MPRs and displays highly conserved interactions with the VHS domains of Drosophila GGA homolog and mammalian GGAs. These data establish a potential role for LERP in the biogenesis of Drosophila lysosomes and suggest that the participation of GGA in packaging sorting receptors of the lysosomal system is conserved between mammals and fruit fly. Chemicals were from Sigma. 4-Methyumbelliferyl substrates for the lysosomal glycosidases were from Calbiochem. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with Glutamax-I (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection of MEF cells deficient in MPR46 and MPR300 (mpr(-/-)MEF) was performed as described (23.Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Drosophila S2 cells were cultivated in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 units/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine in the absence of CO2. RNA Preparation—Total RNA was prepared from Drosophila embryos and S2 cells using RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the supplier's manual. Reverse Transcription-PCR—First strand cDNA synthesis from total RNA of Drosophila embryos and S2 cells was performed with the OmniScript kit (Qiagen) using oligo(dT)16 primer. Generated first strand cDNAs were used as templates for PCR with primers flanking base pairs 2159–2737 of LERP sequence. The resulting 578-bp PCR fragment was cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and analyzed by sequencing. mRNA Analysis—Total RNA (25 μg) from Drosophila embryos and S2 cells was transferred to Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with an 32P-labeled EcoRI-fragment from pBSK(-)LD06695 (bp 1–1283 of LERP-cDNA). All basic DNA procedures were as described (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). pcDNA3.1 Constructs—pBSK(-)LD06659 was available as an EST clone from Invitrogen. The cDNA of LERP was isolated from the EST clone using an internal XbaI site in the 5′-vector sequence and a KpnI site located downstream of the inserted cDNA in the pBSK(-) vector and cloned into pcDNA 3.1(-)zeo (Invitrogen). The PCR procedure of Horton et al. (25.Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar) was used to add a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag to LERP using an internal primer upstream of the single XhoI site at nucleotide 2350 in cDNA. The resulting 405-bp PCR fragment was then cloned back into the pcDNA3.1(-) expression vector using an internal XhoI and PCR-generated KpnI restriction site 3′ behind the stop codon. During the cloning procedure, the 767-bp 3′-untranslated region was removed. pGEX4T-1 Constructs—The cDNA of Drosophila GGA was isolated from the EST clone pOT2-LD41311 (Drosophila Genomics Resource Center (Bloomington, IN)). An EcoRI/XhoI fragment encoding the Drosophila GGA-VHS domain (amino acid residues 1–147) was obtained by PCR amplification from pOT2-LD41311 and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was expressed in BL21 (pLysS) (Novagen, Schwalbach, Germany) and purified using glutathione 4B-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). pMALc2x Constructs—An EcoRI/SalI fragment encoding the cytoplasmic domain of LERP (amino acid residues 839–886) was obtained by PCR amplification from pBSK(-)LD06695, digested, and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pMALc2x (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany). Mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of LERP were introduced using altered reverse primers resulting in the amino acid substitutions of either aspartate to asparagine or leucine to alanine. The maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 (pLysS) (Novagen) and purified using amylose resin (New England Biolabs). Oligonucleotide sequences used are available on request. Extracts of cell membranes were prepared from the MPR-deficient MEF stably transfected with HA-tagged LERP. Digestion analysis was done with endoglucosaminidase H and peptide-N-glycanase F (New England Biolabs) with the buffers recommended by the supplier. The sample (homogenate, 72 μg of protein) was incubated in 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 100 °C for glycoprotein denaturation. Digestion with 1 unit of endoglucosaminidase H was done in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, at 37 °C for 1 h. Digestion with 1 unit of peptide N-glycanase F was done in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40 at 37 °C for 2 h. The digested samples were run on a SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-HA-specific antibody for detection of LERP. The apparent molecular weights of the LERP bands were calculated using the scion 3-software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Stable transfected MPR-deficient MEFs were cultured for 24 h in normal growth medium. The medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in which the lysosomal hydrolases had been inactivated. The cells were then incubated for 10 h. Cells and media were analyzed for the activities of lysosomal enzymes using fluorometric assays as described (23.Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). MPR300-Sepharose affinity chromatography of [35S]methionine-labeled supernatants from cultured cells was performed as described (30.Pohlmann R. Boeker M.W. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). MPR300 was purified from human liver as described (26.von Figura K. Gieselmann V. Hasilik A. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's manual. Media obtained after labeling were subjected to MPR300 affinity chromatography. The material precipitated with 0.5 g/ml ammonium sulfate was dialyzed overnight against buffer A (50 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm EDTA). Media dialyzed against buffer A were incubated overnight with MPR-Affi-Gel 10 (end-over-end rotation) (0.2 mg of MPR 300/ml gel). Then the material was washed with 6 × 2 ml of buffer A and with 3 × 1 ml of 5 mm glucose 6-phosphate and 3 × 1 ml of 5 mm mannose 6-phosphate in buffer A. The mannose 6-phosphate eluates were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid; pooled and dissolved in 50 μl of 0.4 m Tris; heated for 5 min at 95 °C in 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS; and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) and fluorography. Phosphomannan-Sepharose affinity chromatography was performed as described (27.Wendland M. Hille A. Nagel G. Waheed A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. Biochem. J. 1979; 260: 201-206Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Various pH conditions were tested for binding: pH 6.0; pH 6.5; pH 7.0 in binding buffer B (50 mm imidazole/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, and 0.5 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml). Binding of solubilized membrane extracts was analyzed in the presence or absence of divalent cations (MgCl2; CaCl2; MnCl2; each 10 mm). The affinity column was sequentially eluted with 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100 in buffer B and 5 mm mannose 6-phosphate in buffer B/0.05% Triton X-100. The fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. Mouse lamp-2 and lamp-1 were detected using monoclonal anti-mouse hybridoma medium (ABL-93 and 1D4B, respectively) from the Developmental Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA. Human MPR300 was detected either by using a mouse monoclonal antibody (2C2) recognizing a lumenal epitope (28.Chao H.H. Waheed A. Pohlmann R. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3507-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or by using a polyclonal antiserum raised against the recombinant cytoplasmic tail of the MPR300 kindly provided by Thomas Braulke, Universitaets-Klinikum-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. Cathepsin L was detected using a rabbit antiserum kindly provided by Ann Erickson (29.Yeyeodu S. Ahn K. Madden V. Chapman R. Song L. Erickson A.H. Traffic. 2000; 1: 724-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), cathepsin D was detected using a rabbit antiserum (30.Pohlmann R. Boeker M.W. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), HA-tagged LERP was detected by monoclonal antibody 3F10 from rat or monoclonal antibody 12C5 from mouse (Roche Diagnostics), and maltose-binding protein fusion proteins were detected with monoclonal antibody MBP-17 from mouse (Sigma). Samples were prepared and subjected to immunoblotting as described (30.Pohlmann R. Boeker M.W. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For analysis of cathepsin D and cathepsin L, 25 μg of total cellular protein was subjected to immunoblotting, and the blot was probed with antiserum specific for cathepsin D and cathepsin L. For the human MPR300 lumenal domain, the mouse monoclonal antibody 2C2 was used, and the HA tag of LERP was detected using 3F10, a specific monoclonal antibody from rat. The blots were probed using an ECL light-based immunodetection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunostaining analysis was performed as described (18.Dennes A. Madsen P. Nielsen M.S. Petersen C.M. Pohlmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12288-12293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM PCM2000, Nikon, Germany). Primary antibodies were as described above, and fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes/Mobitec, Göttingen, Germany. Glutathione S-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were loaded with equimolar amounts of Escherichia coli expressed and purified GST alone or GST fusion proteins containing the VHS domains of human GGA-1, GGA-2 (11.Nielsen M.S.

Petersen C.M. Pohlmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12288-12293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the GGA homolog of Drosophila (see “Constructs”). Unbound protein was removed by washing the beads as described (18.Dennes A. Madsen P. Nielsen M.S. Petersen C.M. Pohlmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12288-12293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The GST-loaded beads were incubated overnight with equimolar amounts of purified MBP or MBP fusion protein containing the wild type or mutated cytoplasmic domains of LERP. After extensive washing, the precipitated proteins were dissociated from the beads by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and subsequently subjected to immunoblotting for the detection of MBP. The amounts of MBP-LERP fusion protein found in lysates prior to precipitation and the quantity isolated by affinity beads were finally compared by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Characterization of Drosophila Lysosomal Enzyme Receptor Protein—We analyzed the Drosophila genome for sequences homologous to the human MPR300 (accession number J03528) by Blast searches of the Drosophila Flybase (flybase.net) and found the annotated gene CG31072. CG31072 has been mapped to the chromosomal region 97D3–D4 of D. melanogaster chromosome arm 3R. Two EST clones have been cited for this gene, LD05154 and LD06659. Only LD06659 was available from Invitrogen. We sequenced the EST clone LD06659; it codes for 3476 bp and contains an open reading frame of 886 amino acids. The sequence data have been submitted to the GenBank™ data base under accession number AY684632. Protein structure analysis predicted a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with a signal peptide of 40 amino acids, a lumenal domain of 775 amino acids, a transmembrane domain of 23 amino acids, and a cytoplasmic domain of 48 amino acids (Fig. 1 and for details, see supplemental data). We entitled it lysosomal enzyme receptor protein because it has structural homology to the MPR300, one of the lysosomal sorting receptors in mammals. The lumenal domain displays homology to the carbohydrate recognition sequences of the P-lectins and consists of five contiguous repeats of about 155 amino acids corresponding to repeats 9–13 of the 15 repeats in the human MPR300 (Fig. 1). The homologies of the repeats to the human MPR300 repeats are 23–29.5% (for details, see the alignment in Fig. B of the supplemental data). The overall similarity on the amino acid level is 23.5% to the lumenal domain of the human MPR300. A detailed amino acid comparison is shown in Fig. B in the supplemental data. Six cysteine residues are found in each repeat unit of the MPR300 that are known to form three structural important disulfide bonds (Fig. 1) (2.Dahms N. Hancock M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 31-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The positions of the cysteine residues are well conserved in the homologous Drosophila LERP, except in repeat 5, where only one of the disulfide bonds appears to be conserved. Residues identified as essential in the Man6P-binding pocket of repeat 9 of the human MPR300 are not conserved in any of the LERP repeats. The highest homology (29.5%) between the two proteins is found for LERP repeat 3 that corresponds to MPR300 repeat 11. For the mammalian MPR300, it has been shown that IGF2 binds to repeat 11. There the isoleucine residue 1572 is known to be essential for binding of IGF2 by the MPR300. This residue is conserved in LERP (see supplemental data, Fig. B, Ile-407 is marked in pink). Multiple hydrophobic residues identified in the IGF2-binding pocket and core residues for IGF2 binding are also conserved, suggesting a similar function in the Drosophila LERP. However, until now, no gene coding for IGF2 or other IGFs has been identified in Drosophila. Like MPR300, the cytoplasmic domain of LERP contains a classical tyrosine-dependent sorting motif 858YRSV861 of the type YXXΦ (where Φ is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid). Also found is a potential GGA-binding motif (881DDMLL886) of the type DXXLL known to be implicated in packaging sorting receptors such as MPR300 in clathrin-coated vesicles at the TGN (Fig. 1). By mRNA analysis of Drosophila embryos and S2-culture cells, we detected one band of 3.6 kb, suggesting that the 3476 bp of LD06659 represents the full-length transcript (not shown). For the annotated gene CG31072, two transcripts (CG31072-PA and CG31072-PB) have been predicted as potential exon sequences. The comparison with the LD06659 sequence revealed additional amino acids in the lumenal domain in the range of the LERP nucleotides 2350–2584 that were not included in the predictions of the annotated genes. To find out whether more mRNA species for LERP exist, a reverse transcription-PCR was run from Drosophila embryonic mRNA. Primers were placed at nucleotides identical in LD06659 and the predicted transcripts on both sides of the region in question. The only fragment found had exactly the LERP sequence (not shown). This demonstrates that LD06659 represents indeed the transcript of the gene CG31072. A detailed comparison of the intron and exon sequences will be published in the FlyBase data bank (flybase.net). Expression and Localization of LERP—The LERP cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector tagged with a C-terminal HA tag to allow the biochemical and functional analysis of the resulting protein by anti-HA antibodies. Stable transfections were made in MPR-deficient mouse embryonic cells (mpr(-/-)MEF) that missort up to 98% of soluble lysosomal enzymes to the medium due to the lack of sorting MPR. In these cells, the missorting of lysosomal enzymes, causing accumulation of non-degradated material (inclusions), can be rescued by the expression of a receptor protein that re-establishes functional sorting (23.Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical detection of HA-tagged LERP in the transfected mpr(-/-)mouse fibroblasts revealed an intracellular distribution of the Drosophila protein similar to the human MPR300 (Fig. 2, D–F and G–I). Localization of LERP and MPR300 occurs in the same compartment as shown by cotransfection of both cDNAs to mpr(-/-)MEF (Fig. 2, J–L), and no colocalization with the lysosomal marker lamp-2 was detected (Fig. 2, D–F and G–I). Expression of LERP cDNA resulted in a clear reduction in the appearance of inclusions already visible in the light microscope, indicating proper sorting of the degrading lysosomal hydrolases. This corresponds to the significant reduction in size and amount of lamp-2-positive vesicles, which represents lysosomes (compare Fig. 2, B, E, and H). Molecular Properties of LERP—To analyze whether LERP sorting is based on mannose 6-phosphate residues, we prepared membrane fractions from HA-tagged LERP expressing mpr(-/-)MEF by solubilization with Triton X-100. MPR300-expressing mpr(-/-)MEF were used as control. The membrane extracts were passed over a phosphomannan affinity matrix (27.Wendland M. Hille A. Nagel G. Waheed A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. Biochem. J. 1979; 260: 201-206Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Unbound material and material specifically eluted with 5 mm Man6P was analyzed by immunoblotting using a HA-specific antibody (3F10) for LERP detection or the human MPR300-specific antibody (2C2). Analysis of binding was performed by systematic variation of pH values (pH 6; 6."

To seek such sites, Torpedo membranes enriched in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) were preincubated with the hydrophobic probe 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-iodophenyl) diazirine ([125I]TID) and exposed to agonist for either 0 ms (closed state), 1.5 and 10 ms (activated states), 1 s (fast desensitized state), or ≥1 h (equilibrium or slow desensitized state) and then rapidly frozen (<1 ms) and photolabeled. Within 1.5 ms, the fractional change in photoincorporation relative to the closed state decreased to 0.7 in the β- and γ-subunits, whereas in the α-subunit, it changed little. The most dramatic change occurred in the δ-subunit, where it increased to 1.6 within 10 ms but fell to 0.7 during fast desensitization. Four residues in the δ-subunit's transmembrane domain accounted for the enhanced photoincorporation induced by a 10-ms agonist exposure both when TID was added simultaneously with agonist and when it was preincubated with membranes. In the published closed state structure, two residues (δThr274 and δLeu278) are situated toward the extracellular end of helix M2, both contralateral to the ion channel and adjacent to the third residue (δPhe232) on M1. The fourth labeled residue (δIle288) is toward the end of the M2-M3 loop. Contact with these residues occurs on the time scale of a rapid phase of TID inhibition in Torpedo nAChRs, suggesting the formation of a transient hydrophobic pocket between M1, M2, and M3 in the δ-subunit during gating.

Full-Text PDF Open Access General anesthetics exert their primary actions on ion channels of neuronal plasma membranes, particularly at synapses. Among the most sensitive of these targets are the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily of receptors that include anion channels gated by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAA R, subtype A γ-aminobutyric acid receptor; ACh, acetylcholine; Carb, carbamylcholine; EndoLys-C, endoproteinase Lys-C; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; OPA, o-phthalaldehyde; TID, 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-iodophenyl) diazirine; V8 protease, S. aureus endopeptidase Glu-C; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAA R, subtype A γ-aminobutyric acid receptor; ACh, acetylcholine; Carb, carbamylcholine; EndoLys-C, endoproteinase Lys-C; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; OPA, o-phthalaldehyde; TID, 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-iodophenyl) diazirine; V8 protease, S. aureus endopeptidase Glu-C; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. and glycine and cation channels gated by acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin (1.Krasowski M.D. Harrison N.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1278-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 2.Campagna J.A. Miller K.W. Forman S.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 348: 2110-2124Crossref Scopus (631) Google Scholar). In general, the action on anion channels is to shift the agonist concentration-response curve to the left (enhancement) (3.Harrison N.L. Kugler J.L. Jones M.V. Greenblatt E.P. Pritchett D.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 628-632PubMed Google Scholar), probably as a result of stabilizing the open state (4.Ruesch D. Zhong H. Forman S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20982-20992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In cation channels, only a few of the smallest general anesthetics (e.g. urethane and ethanol) act similarly, whereas most are noncompetitive open channel inhibitors (5.Dilger J.P. Br. J. Anaesth. 2002; 89: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). General anesthetics interact with these receptors in a conformationally sensitive manner, often having their highest affinity for those transient conformational states that occur immediately after the agonist binds to the closed state (5.Dilger J.P. Br. J. Anaesth. 2002; 89: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Structural information is key to a complete understanding at the molecular level of anesthetic interactions with the open state, but, given its transitory nature, other techniques will be required for the foreseeable future. Currently, the structure of the transmembrane domain of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is known to 4.0 Å in the closed state (6.Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). The nAChR consists of four subunits, α, β, δ, and γ with a stoichiometry 2:1:1:1, each having a bundle of four transmembrane helices (M1–M4, 27–34 residues in length). The five M2 helices are arranged about a central axis orthogonal to the membrane forming the channel lumen. A 9-Å structure of the open state (7.Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) is of too low a resolution to resolve secondary structure. Electrophysiological studies combined with site-directed mutagenesis provide kinetic evidence that general anesthetics interact with an enhancing site in anion channels that is located within the four-helix bundle of a given subunit (8.Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar) and with an inhibitory site in cation channels located in the channel lumen (9.Forman S.A. Miller K.W. Yellen G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 574-581PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas these models of anesthetic action are self-consistent, much work is necessary to rule out alternative explanations. For example, the mutations might increase the affinity for a distant general anesthetic site by stabilizing a conformation that has high affinity for the anesthetic (5.Dilger J.P. Br. J. Anaesth. 2002; 89: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, a complementary approach that can provide structural information such as ligand-protein contact points is desirable. Photolabeling is an approach that has provided abundant information about agonist and antagonist sites on the nAChR, a member of the superfamily that is abundantly available from the electric tissue of Torpedo (10.Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 11.Arias H.R. Kem W.R. Trudell J.R. Blanton M.P. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2003; 54: 1-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and some, more difficult to achieve, information on GABAA receptors (GABAARs) from the brain (12.Sawyer G.W. Chiara D.C. Olsen R.W. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50036-50045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). With some exceptions (13.Heidmann T. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1897-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14.Cox R.N. Kaldany R.R. DiPaola M. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7186-7193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these studies have been on the closed and desensitized states, conformations that exist at equilibrium, but an improved method of time-resolved photolabeling has now been introduced that has allowed nanomoles of nAChR to be efficiently photolabeled following exposure to agonists and other ligands for times as short as 1 ms (15.Addona G.H. Kloczewiak M.A. Miller K.W. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The interaction of the lipophilic photoactivatable probe 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-iodophenyl) diazirine (TID) with every subunit of the nAChR in the closed and desensitized states has been thoroughly characterized (16.White B.H. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15770-15783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.White B.H. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8741-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18.Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3738-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19.Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), as has the ability of general anesthetics, such as barbiturates, to modulate its photoincorporation (20.Arias H.R. McCardy E.A. Gallagher M.J. Blanton M.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 497-506PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation of nAChRs with TID causes closed state inhibition, which develops on the same 100-ms timescale (21.Wu G. Raines D.E. Miller K.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15375-15381Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) as the increase in photolabeling of the channel lumen, whereas equilibration with the lipid-protein interface is complete within a few milliseconds (22.Chiara D.C. Kloczewiak M.A. Addona G.H. Yu J.A. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition to the above closed state inhibition, rapid perfusion studies of mouse muscle nAChRs reveal a phase of inhibition that occurs on the 10-ms time scale immediately following agonist-induced activation (23.Forman S.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14559-14564Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present work, we find that during channel gating, TID interacts uniquely with the nAChR δ-subunit, where, within 10 ms after the addition of agonist, photoincorporation has increased about one and a half times but then decreases during fast desensitization. With reference to the nAChR closed state structure (6.Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), three of the additional activation-dependent amino acid residues photolabeled by TID are clustered together on M1 and M2, and the fourth is on the M2-M3 loop close to the start of M3, suggesting the formation of a transient hydrophobic pocket in that region during activation. Materials—3-(Trifluoromethyl)3-m-([125I]iodophenyl)-diazirine ([125I]TID; nominal specific activity of 10 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Endoproteinase Lys-C (EndoLys-C) was obtained from Roche Applied Science, and Staphylococcus aureus endopeptidase Glu-C (V8 protease) was from ICN. Sample buffer for gel electrophoresis was obtained from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were from Sigma or Aldrich. Torpedo physiological saline contained 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 0.02% NaN3. Preparation of nAChR-rich Membranes—nAChR-rich membranes, prepared from the electric organs of Torpedo californica (Aquatic Research Consultants, San Pedro, CA) as described (24.Pedersen S.E. Sharp S.D. Liu W.S. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10489-10499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were stored at –80 °C in 38% sucrose, 0.02% NaN3. Protein concentrations were determined by the micro-BCA assay method (Pierce), and the ACh binding site concentration was determined by an [3H]ACh (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) binding assay. Time-resolved Photolabeling of nAChR-rich Membranes—The method was detailed previously (15.Addona G.H. Kloczewiak M.A. Miller K.W. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 22.Chiara D.C. Kloczewiak M.A. Addona G.H. Yu J.A. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, the rapid mixing device was completely filled with buffer from the drive syringes to the two six-way sample valves, each of which contained a 0.5-ml sample loop loaded with appropriate reagents. The pneumatic ram delivered sufficient buffer both to force the reagents in the sample loops through the mixer in <1 ms and to expel only the mixed sample from the aging tube (≥1.3 ms) onto a rotating stainless steel disk, precooled in liquid nitrogen, where it was frozen in a thin film within 1 ms (freeze quenching). Incubation times were varied by changing the velocity of the ram and the length of the aging tube. Typically, one sample loop contained 0.5 ml of membranes (4 mg/ml protein), sometimes premixed with [125I]TID and/or carbamylcholine (Carb), and the other contained 0.5 ml of Torpedo physiological saline, Carb, and/or [125I]TID. After mixing, the concentrations were 3.5 μm [125I]TID and 10 mm Carb. Stainless steel tubing was used throughout. Freeze-quenched membranes were irradiated (Blak-Ray UV lamp model UVL-56) on the slowly rotating disk for 30 min at 366 nm at a distance of ∼3 cm. To obtain sufficient material for identification of labeled amino acids (preparative photolabeling), six samples per condition were photolabeled in the frozen state, and the material was subsequently combined for analysis. Twelve samples can be handled on a typical day. SDS-PAGE—Aliquots of the thawed [125I]TID-labeled nAChR-rich membranes were analyzed for protein concentration. The rest of the frozen membranes were thawed in an appropriate amount of 4× sample buffer such that the final mixture contained 10% glycerol, 2% lithium dodecyl sulfate, 140 mm Tris-base, 106 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.22 mm Serva Blue G250, 0.175 mm phenol red, 0.23 m β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.5. The protein concentrations of the resuspended membranes were used to calculate the appropriate volumes to load for mass-balanced analytical SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The nAChR-rich membrane polypeptides were resolved by SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli buffer system (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) with 8% acrylamide separating gels (1.5 mm thick) containing 0.32% bisacrylamide. Polypeptides were visualized by Coomassie Blue stain, and the bands corresponding to the nAChR subunits as well as bands at 43 and 90 kDa, containing the non-nAChR peptides rapsyn and the Na+/K+ ATPase α-subunit, respectively, were excised from the gel for γ-counting (Micromedic 4/800 plus, Titertek Instruments, Huntsville, AL) and/or further processing. EndoLys-C digests were separated on 1.5-mm-thick 16.5% T/6% C Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gels (19.Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The labeled bands of interest were detected within the wet gel by phosphorimaging (1–8-h exposure at 25 °C) using a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and the resulting image was used as a template for cutting up the gel. Prestained molecular mass standards (M-4038; Sigma) were used to determine the migration distances of the labeled fragments. Subunit or fragment bands of interest were eluted passively (3 days) in 12 ml of elution buffer (100 mm NH4HCO3, 0.1% SDS, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.4), filtered, concentrated in Vivaspin 15-ml concentrators (Vivascience, Hanover, Germany), and either precipitated in 75% acetone (–20 °C, >3 h) or separated directly by reversed-phase HPLC. Enzymatic Digestion of [125I]TID-labeled nAChR Subunits—EndoLys-C digestions were performed in 25 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.6, for 2 weeks at 25 °C. For V8 protease digestion of material after HPLC, the fractions (∼350 μl) were first neutralized by the addition of 200 μl of 25 mm Tris, pH 8.6, containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5 mm EDTA. The acid-neutralized pool was then rotary-evaporated to remove most of the organic solvent, and V8 protease (100 μg) was added for 2 days at 25 °C. Reversed-phase HPLC Purification of [125I]TID-labeled Fragments— Purification was performed on an Agilent 1100 HPLC with an inline degasser, column heater, and external absorbance detector. Separations were achieved at 40 °C using a Brownlee Aquapore C-4 column (100 × 2.1 mm) with a C-2 guard column. All solvents were HPLC grade. The aqueous phase (solvent A) was 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid, and the organic phase (solvent B) was 60% acetonitrile, 40% 2-propanol, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rates were 0.2 ml/min, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Amino-terminal Sequence Analysis of [125I]TID-labeled Fragments— Samples were sequenced on a Procise 492 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) modified such that one-sixth of each cycle was used for amino acid identification and quantification, and five-sixths were collected to measure 125I. HPLC fractions for sequencing were pooled and drop-loaded onto Biobrene-treated glass fiber filters (Applied Biosystems catalog no. 401111) at 45 °C. When samples in detergent were loaded onto the filters, the detergent was removed by a prewash consisting of 5 min of gas trifluoroacetic acid, followed by 5-min washes with ethyl acetate and then n-butylchloride. The cpm detected in each cycle of Edman degradation were corrected by subtraction of the background, which varied from 10 to 25 cpm, in each of the channels of a Packard Cobra B5005 γ-counter. All samples were sequenced between 60 and 100 days after the labeling and were back-corrected for 125I decay to the date of labeling. Phenylthiohydantoin-derivatized amino acids were quantified from chromatographic peak heights, and the corrected 125I cpm and pmol released are reported. Initial pmol (I0) and repetitive yields (R) were calculated from a nonlinear least squares fit (Sigma Plot, Jandel Scientific) of the equation, f(x) = I0·Rx, where f(x)is the pmol of the amino acid in cycle x. Arginines, serines, histidines, tryptophans, and cysteines were excluded from the fit because of known problems with their recovery. To quantify [125I]TID photoincorporation into specific residues, the increase in 125I cpm released at that cycle (i.e. cpmn – cpm(n - 1)) was divided by 5 times the pmol of the amino acid calculated from the values of I0 and R. For some samples, the sequencing run was interrupted, and the material on the filter was treated with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) as described (26.Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6987-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). OPA reacts with primary amines preferentially over secondary amines (i.e. proline), and it may be used at any sequencing cycle to block Edman degradation of peptides not containing an N-terminal proline (27.Brauer A.W. Oman C.L. Margolies M.N. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Oocyte Expression of Torpedo nAChRs—Stage V and VI oocytes were harvested from anesthetized Xenopus frogs, in accordance with local and federal guidelines for animal care. Plasmids containing cDNAs for Torpedo α, β, γ, and δ nAChR subunits were linearized with restriction endonucleases and used as templates for in vitro mRNA transcription using commercial kits (mMessage Machine, Ambion, Austin, TX). Mixtures of mRNAs at 2α:1β:1γ:1δ stoichiometry were injected into oocytes (total = 20–50 ng) and incubated at 17 °C for 48–96 h in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (1% v/v). Oocytes were manually stripped of vitelline membranes for patch clamp electrophysiology. Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Methods have been described previously (23.Forman S.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14559-14564Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 21–23 °C. Internal pipette and external buffers were K-100 (97 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). Oocyte membrane patches were excised in the outside-out configuration on borosilicate pipettes (1.2–3 megaohms) and voltage-clamped at –50 mV. Patches were positioned in the outflow of a custom-built 2 × 2 quad-barrel superfusion pipette, coupled to two orthogonal piezo electric elements. Application of RC-damped high DC voltages to the piezo elements moved the superfusion pipette and resulted in switching between adjacent superfusion solutions in <1 ms (10–90% rise time of open pipette junction potential). In some experiments, two superfusion barrels were used: one containing K-100 buffer and an adjacent barrel containing ACh or ACh plus TID. If TID preincubation was required, three barrels were used: K-100, TID, and ACh plus TID. Patch currents stimulated by ACh were monitored and filtered (8-pole bessel, 1 kHz) with an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Recording of digitized data (1–2 kHz) and control of the piezo-driven superfusion device were achieved using a Digidata 1200 series interface and pClamp 7.0 software (both from Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Analysis of Electrophysiological Data—Current traces were analyzed offline. Base-line leak currents were subtracted digitally. Current decay rates were determined by fitting exponential decay functions to data points from the peak current to the point at which ACh superfusion ceased. Nonlinear least squares fitting was performed using Clampfit 7.0 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Overall Experimental Design Considerations—Our experimental design was based on knowledge of Torpedo nAChR kinetics. Agonist-induced channel activation occurs in ∼100 μs (28.Lingle C.J. Maconochie D. Steinbach J.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 126: 195-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), within the dead time of our apparatus, and peak Carb-induced cation flux in Torpedo vesicles is linear over at least 10 ms, being terminated by fast desensitization with a time constant of ∼200 ms (29.Forman S.A. Firestone L.L. Miller K.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30.Forman S.A. Miller K.W. Biophys. J. 1988; 54: 149-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, in the absence of agonist, ∼10% of receptors are in the desensitized rather than the closed state (31.Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4023-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose agonist incubation times of 0 (resting states), 1.5 and 10 ms (activated states), 1 s (fast desensitized state), and ∼1 h (slow desensitized state). Initially, the membranes were preincubated with TID before being rapidly mixed with saturating concentrations of agonist so that nAChR-TID interaction kinetics with the closed state (see Introduction) (15.Addona G.H. Kloczewiak M.A. Miller K.W. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 22.Chiara D.C. Kloczewiak M.A. Addona G.H. Yu J.A. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) would not be superimposed upon agonist-induced changes. Subsequently, TID was added simultaneously with agonist to obtain a sense of the relative accessibility of the TID interaction sites. Time Dependence of Agonist Action on TID Photoincorporation into nAChR Subunits—Fig. 1A shows a typical phosphor image of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel of membranes preincubated with TID and exposed for 10 ms either to 10 mm Carb or to buffer before freeze quenching and photolabeling. In this experiment, Carb increased photoincorporation of [125I]TID into the δ-subunit markedly, whereas that into the γ-subunit decreased, and that into all other bands changed little. The combined results from several separate experiments are shown in Fig. 1B, where the data for each experiment have been normalized to the zero time (no Carb) control (see legend). The overall percentage S.D. (coefficient of variation) for the data set of ratios was 12%. The δ-subunit showed the most complex changes with exposure time to agonist. Photoincorporation increased 1.6-fold 10 ms after adding Carb, followed by an equally dramatic decrease first to just below control values at 1 s and then to much lower values similar to the β- and γ-subunits at equilibrium. The α-subunit did not decrease at early times but showed a slight decline at later times. The β- and γ-subunits were the only subunits to decline significantly at 1.5 ms. They declined further by 1 s but did not change thereafter. Modest photoincorporation into the non-nAChR polypeptides was always observed but did not change upon exposure to agonist. [125I]TID Photoincorporation into the Transmembrane Domain of the δ-Subunit—The δ-subunit was chosen for more detailed study because of its unique kinetics (Fig. 1). nAChR-rich membranes preincubated with [125I]TID were exposed to 10 mm Carb or to buffer (six replicates each) for 10 ms, freeze-quenched, and photolabeled. The membrane polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the δ-subunits (visualized by Coomassie stain) were excised, eluted, concentrated, and acetone-precipitated. The resuspended δ-subunits were digested in solution with EndoLys-C, which produces subunit fragments of ∼21 kDa (δEKC-21, beginning at δHis20/δHis26 and containing most of the extracellular domain), ∼10 kDa (beginning at δMet257, the beginning of δM2), and ∼12 kDa (beginning at δPhe206 and containing a site of N-linked glycosylation (δAsn208) and δM1) (22.Chiara D.C. Kloczewiak M.A. Addona G.H. Yu J.A. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 32.Ziebell M.R. Nirthanan S. Husain S.S. Miller K.W. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17640-17649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). When the δ-subunit EndoLys-C digests were separated by Tricine gel SDS-PAGE, phosphorimaging revealed two major photolabeled bands of ∼10 kDa (δEKC-10) and ∼13 kDa (δEKC-13) (Fig. 2A). For both labeling conditions, the amount of 125I in bands between 20 and 24 kDa was less than 15% of that in δEKC-10 and δEKC-13, which sets an upper limit on the amount of [125I]TID incorporation in the δEKC-21. Using this image as a template, δEKC-10 and -13 were excised, eluted, concentrated, and further purified by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively). Below, we first describe the analysis of purified δEKC-10, leading to the identification of photolabeled amino acids in δM2-δM3 (Figs. 3, 4, 5). Subsequently, we describe the analysis of fractions purified from δEKC-13 that identify the labeled amino acids in δM1 (Fig. 6).Fig. 3Identification of amino acids in δM2 and δM3 photolabeled by [125I]TID after 10-ms exposure to agonist. Shown is 125I (•, ○) and pmol (□) release when aliquots of fractions 26 and 27 from the HPLC fractionation of δEKC-10 (Fig. 2B) were sequenced. A, for the –Carb (○) and +Carb (•) samples, the only sequence detected began at δMet256 (+Carb (□), I0 = 8 pmol, R = 96% for cycles 1–18 and R = 91% thereafter; –Carb (not shown), I0 = 9 pmol, R = 94% for cycles 1–18 and 92% thereafter). For the +Carb and –Carb samples, 46,780 and 24,180 cpm were loaded on the filters, with 12,370 and 6,590 cpm remaining after 55 and 40 cycles of Edman degradation. The photolabeling efficiencies calculated from the 125I and pmol release are tabulated in Table I. Inset, a replot of the data on an expanded cpm scale to highlight the agonist-dependent release in cycles 18, 22, and 32.

The sequence beginning at δMet257 (□, I0 = 10 pmol, R = 92%) was identified for all 40 cycles of Edman degradation, and after OPA treatment, 125I release in cycle 32 was preserved.

https://openalex.org/W1970272786,"A nonsense mutation at codon Glu180 in exon 11 of slow skeletal muscle troponin T (TnT) gene (TNNT1) causes an autosomal-recessive inherited nemaline myopathy. We previously reported the absence of intact or prematurely terminated slow TnT polypeptide in Amish nemaline myopathy (ANM) patient muscle. The present study further investigates the expression and fate of mutant slow TnT in muscle cells. Intact slow TnT mRNA was readily detected in patient muscle, indicating unaffected transcription and RNA splicing. Sequence of the cloned cDNAs revealed the single nucleotide mutation in two alternatively spliced isoforms of slow TnT mRNA. Mutant TNNT1 cDNA is translationally active in Escherichia coli and non-muscle eukaryotic cells, producing the expected truncated slow TnT protein. The mutant mRNA was expressed at significant levels in differentiated C2C12 myotubes, but unlike intact exogenous TnT, truncated slow TnT protein was not detected. Transfective expression in undifferentiated myoblasts produced slow TnT mRNA but not a detectable amount of truncated or intact slow TnT proteins, indicating a muscle cell-specific proteolysis of TnT when it is not integrated into myofilaments. The slow TnT-(1–179) fragment has substantially lower affinity for binding to tropomyosin, in keeping with the loss of one of two tropomyosin-binding sites. Our findings suggest that inefficient incorporation into myofilament is responsible for the instability of mutant slow TnT in ANM muscle. Rapid degradation of the truncated slow TnT protein, rather than instability of the nonsense mRNA, provides the protective mechanism against the potential dominant negative effect of the mutant TnT fragment.

Striated muscle contraction is initiated by a series of Ca2+-induced allosteric changes in troponin and tropomyosin. The conformational changes in these thin filament regulatory proteins allow the interaction of myosin in the thick filament to form a strong cross-bridge with F-actin, activate myosin ATPase, and generate contractile force (1.Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Troponin is a complex of three component proteins: TnC 1The abbreviations used are: TnC, troponin C; TnI, troponin I; TnT, troponin T; ANM, Amish nemaline myopathy; CMV, cytomegalovirus; FBS, fetal bovine serum; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MHC, myosin heavy chain; RT, reverse transcription; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. (the Ca2+-binding subunit), TnI (the inhibitory subunit), and TnT (the tropomyosin-binding subunit) (2.Leavis P.C. Gergely J. CRC Crit. Rev.

Mol. Biol. 1998; 227: 1081-1089Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In anchoring the troponin complex to tropomyosin and actin, TnT occupies an organizer position and role for this Ca2+ signaling machinery (3.Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev.

Higher vertebrates have evolved three different types of muscle, and three homologous TnT genes exist that encode isoforms of TnT specific to each type: slow skeletal muscle TnT (TNNT1), fast skeletal muscle TnT (TNNT3), and cardiac TnT (TNNT2) (6.Huang Q.-Q.

In adult animals, these TnT isoforms are specifically expressed within their respective muscle fiber types. Whereas the three TnT isoforms have diverged in structure, each shows evolutionary conservation across the vertebrate phylum (10.Jin J.-P. Chen A. Huang Q.-Q. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 214: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting that each isoform possesses a differentiated functional role. A nonsense mutation at codon Glu180 in exon 11 of slow skeletal muscle TnT gene TNNT1 is found to cause an autosomal-recessive inherited form of nemaline myopathy named Amish nemaline myopathy (ANM) (11.Johnston J.J. Kelley R.I. Crawford T.O. Morton D.H. Agarwal R. Koch T. Schaffer A.A. Francomano C.A. Biesecker L.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 814-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This is the first skeletal muscle troponin disease identified. Whereas most human skeletal muscles contain mixed fast and slow fibers (12.Baldwin K.M. Haddad F. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and express both fast and slow TnTs (13.Jin J.-P. Brotto M.A. Hossain M.M. Huang Q.Q. Brotto L.S. Nosek T.M. Morton D.H. Crawford T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26159-26165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the fact that loss of only one isoform of TnT causes lethal myopathy provides the first evidence for the critical role of the functionally diverged fiber type-specific TnT isoforms. This mutation is predicted to produce a truncated slow TnT protein (slow TnT-(1–179)), but muscle of ANM patients showed no intact or truncated slow TnT (13.Jin J.-P. Brotto M.A. Hossain M.M.

This raises a question about the expression of mutant TNNT1 or fate of transcribed mutant slow TnT gene products in ANM muscle cells. Imaging and structural studies suggest that TnT adopts an extended conformation (14.Cabral-Lilly D. Tobacman L.S. Mehegan J.P. Cohen C. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1763-1770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15.Wendt T. Guenebaut V. Leonard K.R. J. Struct.

Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Studies using proteolytically cleaved or genetically engineered TnT fragments have identified two protein-binding domains of TnT. The C-terminal (T2) region binds to the central region of tropomyosin and interacts with TnI, TnC, and F-actin (18.Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19.Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10587-10592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Heeley D.H. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8227-8232Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The central region of TnT has another tropomyosin-binding site that binds to the tropomyosin head-to-tail overlap junction in the thin filament (21.Heeley D.H. Golosinska K. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9971-9978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6894-6903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Schaertl S. Lehman S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15890-15894Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of partial human cardiac troponin complex including the C-terminal domain of TnT agrees with these protein binding data (17.Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The ANM nonsense mutation in codon Glu180 of the slow TnT gene results in a deletion of the C-terminal 83 amino acids of the protein, removing the majority of the T2 domain that contains the TnC, TnI, and C-terminal tropomyosin-binding sites. Nonetheless, the truncated slow TnT-(1–179) fragment retains the central tropomyosin-binding site that participates in the anchoring of troponin complex to the thin filament (18.Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Despite encoding a potentially deleterious functional structure, a single copy of the mutant slow TnT allele does not appear to affect ANM carriers (11.Johnston J.J. Kelley R.I. Crawford T.O. Morton D.H. Agarwal R. Koch T. Schaffer A.A. Francomano C.A. Biesecker L.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 814-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This is in marked contrast to a human cardiac TnT truncation mutation, deleting the C-terminal 14 amino acids, which causes a dominantly inherited familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (24.Tardiff J.C. Factor S.M. Tompkins B.D. Hewett T.E. Palmer B.M. Moore R.L. Schwartz S. Robbins J. Leinwand L.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2800-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition to increasing our understanding of the molecular pathology of ANM, investigation of the expression and fate of mutant slow TnT may also provide information about the protective mechanism that effectively eliminates mutant slow TnT from ANM muscle cells. In the present study, we found that the mutant slow TnT mRNA was readily detected in patient muscle, indicating unaffected transcription and RNA processing. Sequence of the cloned cDNA reveals the single nucleotide mutation in two alternatively spliced slow TnT isoform mRNAs. The mutant cDNA can be expressed in Escherichia coli and non-muscle eukaryotic cells to produce truncated slow TnT protein at high levels. Transfective expression of the mutant slow TnT cDNA in C2C12 myotubes produces significant amounts of the mutant mRNA, but no detectable truncated slow TnT. Furthermore, transfective expression in undifferentiated myoblasts do not produce a detectable amount of truncated or intact slow TnT proteins, indicating a muscle cell-specific proteolysis of TnT when it is not integrated into myofilaments. These results demonstrate instability of slow TnT-(1–179) specifically within muscle cells, suggesting that the loss of TnI, TnC, and one tropomyosin-binding site restricts incorporation of mutant slow TnT into the myofilament, which in turn leads to accelerated degradation. Therefore, rapid degradation of TnT-(1–179) protein, rather than loss of the nonsense mRNA, is responsible for the absence of a dominant effect of this mutation. Cloning of Mutant Human Slow TnT cDNA from ANM Patient Muscle—A frozen diagnostic muscle biopsy obtained from the quadriceps muscle of a 7-week-old ANM patient was used for RNA isolation. This investigation was determined to be exempted research under section IV C criteria by the Johns Hopkins Hospital Institutional Review Board. This patient was previously confirmed for homozygous mutation at codon Glu180 in the slow TnT gene (11.Johnston J.J. Kelley R.I. Crawford T.O. Morton D.H. Agarwal R. Koch T. Schaffer A.A. Francomano C.A. Biesecker L.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 814-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and the muscle sample showed no detectable intact or truncated slow TnT protein (13.Jin J.-P. Brotto M.A. Hossain M.M. Huang Q.Q. Brotto L.S. Nosek T.M. Morton D.H. Crawford T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26159-26165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As described previously (25.Wang J. Jin J.-P. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 193: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), total RNA was isolated from ∼5 mg of muscle tissue using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two μg of the muscle RNA was used to synthesize cDNA by reverse transcription (RT) using an oligonucleotide primer (5′-T19V-3′,V = A, C, or G) complementary to the poly(A) tail of mRNA in an anchored manner. From the cDNA mixture copied from all poly(A)+ mRNA, cDNA encoding slow skeletal muscle TnT was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers synthesized according to the human slow TnT gene sequence (GenBank™ accession number NT_011109.15, position 27912387.27928764 in the chromosome 19 genomic contig). The forward primer sequence corresponds to a part of exon 2 flanking the translation initiation codon plus an NdeI cloning site and the reverse primer sequence corresponds to a part of exon 14 flanking the translation termination codon with an EcoRI cloning site incorporated. The PCR products were verified by a secondary PCR using a slow TnT-specific internal reverse primer paired with the exon 2 forward primer, cut at the NdeI and EcoRI sites built at the ends of the cDNA, and cloned into TOPO pCR4 vector (Invitrogen). After transformation of host E. coli cells, colonies containing the recombinant plasmid were identified by PCR using slow TnT-specific primers and the plasmid DNA was purified for sequencing the cDNA insert by the dideoxy chain termination method at a service facility. Mutagenesis in Mouse Slow TnT cDNA—We have previously cloned full-length mouse cDNA encoding the alternatively spliced high and low molecular weight slow TnT isoforms (10.Jin J.-P. Chen A. Huang Q.-Q. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 214: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Using the cDNAs cloned in pAED4 plasmid (26.Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6908-6916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as template, recombinant PCR was used to create a stop codon at Glu180. A pair of complementary mutagenesis oligonucleotide primers was synthesized to reproduce the G to T mutation found in ANM patients (11.Johnston J.J. Kelley R.I. Crawford T.O. Morton D.H. Agarwal R. Koch T. Schaffer A.A. Francomano C.A. Biesecker L.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 814-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The primer sequences and the mutagenesis strategy are shown in Fig. 1. An EcoRI restriction endonuclease cutting site was constructed in the primer sequences downstream of the mutant stop codon to introduce a unique genotyping marker for the transgene product. The mutagenesis primers were used together with the T7 and pET reverse primers flanking the 5′- and 3′-ends of the mouse slow TnT cDNA in the vector sequence to construct the mutant cDNA by a three-step recombinant PCR procedure. The reconstituted full-length slow TnT cDNA containing the point mutation and EcoRI site was digested with restriction enzymes XbaI and XhoI and ligated into compatibly cut pAED4 vector DNA. After transformation of JM109 E. coli cells, colonies containing the recombinant plasmids were identified by PCR using T7 primer in the 5′-flanking region of the vector sequence and a reverse primer specific to the mouse slow TnT cDNA insert. The PCR-positive cDNA clones were further screened by mini-scale expression in E. coli. Briefly, the transformed JM109 E. coli colonies were expanded as 0.5 × 2–3-cm smear cultures on LB/ampicillin agar plates (∼20 smears per 100-mm plate). Approximately one-third of each smear was transferred using a toothpick to a 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 20 μl of 1:1 phenol:chloroform and 20 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA). The tubes were touch spun to get the bacteria into the chemical mixture and then vortexed for 2 s. The tubes were then spun in a microcentrifuge at top speed at room temperature for 2 min. One μl of the aqueous layer that contains nucleic acid extracted from the bacteria was used to transform BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli. Cells from 4 to 6 transformations can be plated in separate areas on an 100-mm LB/ampicillin/chloromphenicol plate for culture at 37 °C overnight. From each transformation, multiple bacterial colonies were collected to start 2-ml cultures in LB/ampicillin/chloromphenicol media containing 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After being cultured at 37 °C with shaking for 3 h, the induced bacteria were collected by centrifugation, lysed in SDS gel sample buffer, and used for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described below. After confirming expression of the anticipated slow TnT fragment, the recombinant plasmid DNA was purified from the original JM109 cultures and the slow TnT cDNA insert was sequenced as above to verify the mutagenesis as well as authenticity. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Muscle samples or bacterial extracts were homogenized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2% SDS. After being heated at 80 °C for 5 min and clarified by spinning in a microcentrifuge at top speed and room temperature for 5 min, the total protein extracts were resolved by polyacrylamide gel using the Laemmli buffer system. The resulting gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 to reveal the resolved protein bands. Duplicate gels were electrically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as previously described (27.Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). After blocking in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with (a) monoclonal antibody (mAb) CT3 recognizing slow and cardiac TnT (28.Jin J.-P. Chen A. Ogut O. Huang Q.-Q. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1067-C1077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (b) mAb T12 against fast TnT (Ref. 29.Lin J.J.-C. Feramisco J.R. Blose S.H. Matsumura F. Kennett R.H. Bechtol K.B. McKearn T.J. Monoclonal Antibodies and Functional Cell Lines. Plenum Publishing Co., New York1984: 119-151Crossref Google Scholar, a gift from Dr. Jim Lin, University of Iowa), (c) rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against fast TnT, or (d) mAb TnI-1 against TnI (30.Jin J.-P. Yang F.-W. Yu Z.-B. Ruse C.I. Bond M. Chen A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The membranes were then washed with high stringency using Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.05% SDS, incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG second antibody (Sigma), and washed again. The blots were developed in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate solution as previously described (27.Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to reveal TnT or TnI bands. Expression and Purification of Truncated Human Slow TnT—cDNA encoding mutant human slow TnT was subcloned into the pAED4 prokaryotic expression vector as described for the mutant mouse slow TnT cDNAs. By transformation of BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells, large scale protein expression was carried out in 2× TY media containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 12.5 mg/liter chloroamphenicol with vigorous shaking at 22 °C. When A600 nm reached ∼0.2, the cultures were induced by 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and further incubated for 6–8 h. The induced bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol by passing a French cell press at 1,000 p.s.i. three times. The cell lysis was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and the fraction between 30 and 55% saturation at 0 °C was dialyzed against 0.1 mm EDTA containing 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Following dialysis, the fraction was brought to 6 m urea, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, clarified by centrifugation, and chromatographed on a DE-52 cellulose anion-exchange column equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was eluted with a linear KCl gradient (0–300 mm) in the same buffer and the protein peaks were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing human slow TnT-(1–179) fragment were dialyzed against 0.1 mm EDTA and concentrated by lyophilization. The truncated slow TnT was further purified by Sephadex G-75 gel filtration chromatography in 6 m urea, 0.5 m KCl, and 10 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, as described previously (31.Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Both high and low molecular weight variants of truncated human slow TnT were purified by this procedure. Construction of Eukaryotic Expression Vectors—The mutant mouse slow TnT cDNA was isolated as an NdeI/XhoI fragment and subcloned into BamHI/XhoI cut pcDNA3.1(+) eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen) downstream of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter for expression in non-muscle and undifferentiated muscle cells. Recombinant plasmids with slow TnT cDNA inserted in the sense orientation were selected by PCR using a CMV promoter-specific forward primer and a slow TnT cDNA-specific reverse primer. The positive plasmids were verified by restriction endonuclease mapping. To construct an expression vector specific to differentiated muscle cells, the mutant mouse slow TnT cDNAs were inserted into the XhoI site of a promoter-less pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid upstream of the SV40 intron sequence. The CMV promoter in the pcDNA3.1(+) had been deleted by NheI and NruI digestion and self-ligation. A 5.5-kb mouse genomic DNA fragment containing the β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) promoter (32.Rindt H. Gulick J. Knotts S. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5332-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. Jeffrey Robbins, University of Cincinnati) was then inserted into the NotI site upstream of the mutant mouse slow TnT cDNA. The rational for using β-MHC promoter that is active in differentiated C2C12 myocytes (33.Miller J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1149-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) for the expression of exogenous slow TnT cDNA is to allow the transgene to be independent of the endogenous slow TnT gene regulation. The recombinant plasmids were screened by PCR and verified by restriction enzyme mapping. Transfection of Monolayer Cell Cultures—For use in cell transfection experiments, the recombinant pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid DNA was prepared in large quantities from transformed JM109 E. coli using the QIA-Well cartridge (QIAgen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection of human kidney epithelial cell line 293 (ATCC CRL-1573), mouse fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3 (ATCC CRL-1658), and mouse skeletal myoblast cell line C2C12 (ATCC CRL1772, Ref. 34.Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar) was carried out using the Lipofectamine™ transfection reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Two to five μg of the recombinant supercoil plasmid DNA in 10–50 μl of TE buffer was mixed with 10–15 μl of Lipofectamine in DMEM and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The Lipofectamine-DNA complex was gently mixed with 5 ml of DMEM without fetal bovine serum (FBS) and added to monolayer cell cultures at 50–60% confluent after removing the old medium. After incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 6 h, 5 mL DMEM containing 20% FBS was added and the culture was continued for 12 h before change to fresh culture media containing 10% FBS. For transient transfective expressions, the cells were suspended using the Versene solution (0.537 mm EDTA, 136.8 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2) (35.Hossain M.M. Hwang D.-Y. Huang Q.-Q. Sasaki Y. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C156-C167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, for the examination of slow TnT mRNA and protein expression 30 h after transfection. The elimination of trypsin digestion from the collection of cells for SDS gel and Western analysis avoided artificial enzymatic degradation of the cellular proteins. To establish stable transfection of C2C12 cells, the cells transfected with the G418 resistant recombinant pcDNA3.1 plasmid were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS plus G418 (500 μg/ml, ICN Biomedical, Inc.). Results from testing the tolerance of non-transfected C2C12 cells to G418 showed that this cell line is sensitive to G418. In culture media containing 200 μg/ml G418, all cells died after 9 days of culture. The C2C12 cell colonies resistant to G418 were individually picked up from the culture dish by trypsin digestion in small cylinders greased to the dish. The cells were expanded for extracting DNA to verify the transfection by PCR as described above. The C2C12 cell lines stably transfected with the mutant slow TnT cDNA were expanded and stored in DMEM containing 35% FBS and 10% Me2SO in liquid nitrogen for later characterization. In Vitro Differentiation of C2C12 Myocytes—C2C12 is an immortalized myoblast cell line derived from adult mouse skeletal muscle (34.Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). The cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collections and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, penicillin (100 μg/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The untransfected or transfected C2C12 cells were placed for in vitro differentiation in DMEM as above with 2% horse serum instead of FBS. The expression of TnT isoforms was examined by Western blots in both undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. As described above, the cells in the culture dish were suspended using the Versene solution and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. SDS gel sample buffer was added to dissolve the cells and to extract total cellular protein by vortexing. After heating and centrifugation of the samples, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were carried out as above. Restriction Endonuclease Analysis to Identify and Quantify the Mutant Slow TnT mRNA Expressed in C2C12 Cells—As described above, total RNA was extracted from the stably transfected C2C12 cells using the TRIzol reagent and RT-PCR was carried out to amplify the entire coding region of mouse slow TnT mRNA (Fig. 1). To obtain a quantitative comparison between the endogenous and exogenous slow TnT cDNAs, the PCR program was designed based on preliminary experiments for a pre-saturated level of amplification (data not shown). The total PCR product containing both endogenous and exogenous slow TnT cDNAs were digested with EcoRI at the site built in the exogenous cDNA but absent in the endogenous cDNA (Fig. 1). Agarose gel electrophoresis was carried out to determine the restriction pattern, and densitometry analysis of the ethidium bromide-stained bands was used to quantify the relative levels of endogenous and exogenous slow TnT mRNA. The original RNA extract equivalent to 10-fold of the amount used for the RT-PCR was used in control PCR to avoid samples with any cellular DNA contamination. Expression of Intact Exogenous TnT in C2C12 Cells—We have previously cloned and characterized a 5.4-kb mouse genomic DNA containing the slow skeletal muscle TnT gene promoter (36.Huang Q.-Q. Jin J.-P. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 780-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To evaluate the compatibility of C2C12 cellular environment in expressing exogenous TnT cDNA, we used the mouse slow TnT promoter to direct an expression of chicken fast skeletal muscle TnT in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. A cDNA encoding chicken breast muscle TnT (37.Ogut O. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27858-27866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was constructed downstream of the mouse slow TnT promoter using the pcDNA3.1 backbone as described above. Stably transfected cell lines were established and in vitro differentiation was carried out as above. Expression of chicken fast TnT in differentiated C2C12 myotubes was examined by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody, RATnT, raised against chicken breast muscle TnT (27.Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and an mAb, 6B8, specific to the chicken TnT isoform expressed (27.Wang J. Jin J.-P.

https://openalex.org/W1977775095,"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases (PEPC, EC 4.1.1.31) from higher plants are regulated by both allosteric effects and reversible phosphorylation. Previous x-ray crystallographic analysis of Zea mays PEPC has revealed a binding site for sulfate ion, speculated to be the site for an allosteric activator, glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) (Matsumura, H., Xie, Y., Shirakata, S., Inoue, T., Yoshinaga, T., Ueno, Y., Izui, K., and Kai, Y. (2002) Structure (Lond.) 10, 1721-1730). Because kinetic experiments have also supported this notion, each of the four basic residues (Arg-183, -184, -231, and -372′ on the adjacent subunit) located at or near the binding site was replaced by Gln, and the kinetic properties of recombinant mutant enzymes were investigated. Complete desensitization to Glc-6-P was observed for R183Q, R184Q, R183Q/R184Q (double mutant), and R372Q, as was a marked decrease in the sensitivity for R231Q. The heterotropic effect of Glc-6-P on an allosteric inhibitor, l-malate, was also abolished, but sensitivity to Gly, another allosteric activator of monocot PEPC, was essentially not affected, suggesting the distinctness of their binding sites. Considering the kinetic and structural data, Arg-183 and Arg-231 were suggested to be involved directly in the binding with phosphate group of Glc-6-P, and the residues Arg-184 and Arg-372 were thought to be involved in making up the site for Glc-6-P and/or in the transmission of an allosteric regulatory signal. Most unexpectedly, the mutant enzymes had almost lost responsiveness to regulatory phosphorylation at Ser-15. An apparent lack of kinetic competition between the phosphate groups of Glc-6-P and of phospho-Ser at 15 suggested the distinctness of their binding sites. The possible roles of these Arg residues are discussed.

Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC 1The abbreviations used are: PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; DCDP, 3,3-dichloro-2-dihydroxyphosphinoylmethyl-2-propenoate; DTT, dithiothreitol; EcPEPC, E. coli PEPC; Glc-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PEPC-k, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase; rEK, recombinant enterokinase; ZmPEPC, Z. mays PEPC isoform for C4 photosynthesis; WT, wild type; Fru-1,6-P2, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.; EC 4.1.1.31) is a CO2-fixing enzyme that yields oxaloacetate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and bicarbonate liberating Pi in the presence of Me2+ (1Utter M.F. Kolenbrander H.M. Enzymes. 1972; 6: 117-168Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 2O'Leary M.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1982; 33: 297-315Crossref Google Scholar, 3Chollet R. Vidal J. O'Leary M.H.

Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). PEPC is widespread not only in all photosynthetic organisms such as higher plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and photosynthetic bacteria but also in most nonphotosynthetic bacteria and protozoa. The enzyme is apparently absent in animals, fungi, and yeasts. PEPC plays primarily an anaplerotic role by replenishing C4-dicarboxylic acids utilized for the energy and biosynthetic metabolisms. Moreover, in higher plants, PEPC has many different physiological roles (5Latzko E. Kelly G.J. Physiol. Veg. 1983; 21: 805-815Google Scholar), which are performed by several isoforms with different catalytic and regulatory properties. The most predominant role of PEPC is its participation in the photosynthesis of C4 plants such as maize (Zea mays) and sugarcane and of Crassulacean acid metabolism plants such as cactus and pineapple. In these plants, PEPC catalyzes the primary reaction to capture atmospheric CO2 for their characteristic photosynthesis (6Buchanan B.B. Gruissem W. Jones R.L. Biochemistry & Molecular Biology of Plants, American Society of Plant Physiologists, Rockville, MD2000: 619-626Google Scholar). In N2-fixing legume root nodules, PEPC plays a pivotal role in carbon metabolism (7Buchanan B.B. Gruissem W. Jones R.L. Biochemistry & Molecular Biology of Plants, American Society of Plant Physiologists, Rockville, MD2000: 812-815Google Scholar). PEPC is also involved in the maintenance of the pH balance in the cells of opening stomata, accumulation of organic acids in fruits, in the supply of organic acids exudated from roots to soil for aluminum detoxification, Pi leaching, and so on. PEPC is usually composed of four identical subunits with a molecular mass of about 95-110 kDa. In particular, the subunit molecular size of Archaea is very small (about 60 kDa) (8Sako Y. Takai K. Nishizaka T. Ishida Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 153: 159-165Crossref Google Scholar, 9Patel H.M. Kraszewski J.L. Mukhopadhyay B. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5129-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and that of protozoa (malaria pathogen) deduced from its DNA sequence is very large (about 130 kDa) (www.genedb.org/genedb/malaria/index.jsp, ID: PF14_0246). Most PEPCs studied previously have been allosteric in nature, but their effectors show a wide variety depending on the species of the organisms (1Utter M.F. Kolenbrander H.M. Enzymes. 1972; 6: 117-168Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 10Izui K. Izui K. Enzymes, Lyase. 4. Hirokawa Publishing Co., Tokyo, Japan2002: 37-49Google Scholar), and kinetic properties modified by effectors often differ even among isoforms in the same organisms (11Dong L.Y. Masuda T. Kawamura T. Hata S. Izui K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Svensson P. Bläsing O.E. Westhoff P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, effectors of higher plant PEPCs are rather confined to a set of effectors, namely PEPC of dicot plants is activated by glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) and inhibited by l-malate or aspartate (Asp) and that of monocot plants is activated by glycine (Gly). Furthermore, higher plant PEPCs are regulated by reversible phosphorylation at Ser located near the N terminus, and this phosphorylation is catalyzed by a specific protein kinase called PEPC kinase (PEPC-k) (13Vidal J. Chollet R. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 1360-1385Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Tsuchida Y. Furumoto T. Izumida A. Hata S. Izui K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Nimmo H.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because of the enzymological and physiological importance of PEPC, and its possible usefulness in metabolic engineering (16Miyao M. Fukayama H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Chen L.M. Li K.Z. Miwa T. Izui K. Planta. 2004; 219: 440-449PubMed Google Scholar), the elucidation of its structure-function relationship has long been awaited. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of PEPC was solved by x-ray crystallographic analysis, as reviewed previously (4Izui K. Matsumura H. Furumoto T. Kai Y. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 18Kai Y. Matsumura H. Izui K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The structure of PEPC of Escherichia coli (EcPEPC) was thought to be in an inactive state complexed with an allosteric inhibitor, Asp (19Kai Y. Matsumura H. Inoue T. Terada K. Nagara Y. Yoshinaga T. Kihara A. Tsumura K. Izui K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the structure of PEPC for C4 photosynthesis from Z. mays (ZmPEPC) was thought to be in an activated state, because crystallization was carried out in the presence of ethylene glycol, an activating and compatible solute (20Matsumura H. Xie Y. Shirakata S. Inoue T. Yoshinaga T. Ueno Y. Izui K. Kai Y. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 1721-1730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although identity of amino acid residues between these two enzymes is only about 40%, secondary and three-dimensional structures are very similar to each other (Fig. 1). The catalytic site could be assigned to be above the C-terminal side of β-barrel, consistent with the data of site-directed mutagenesis (19Kai Y. Matsumura H. Inoue T. Terada K. Nagara Y. Yoshinaga T. Kihara A. Tsumura K. Izui K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Although the binding site for the allosteric inhibitor was disclosed in the structure of EcPEPC, the site for Glc-6-P was not known. Close examination of the structure of ZmPEPC revealed the binding of one molecule of SO42− per subunit, which had been used as one of the precipitants for crystallization (Fig. 2, B-D). Because it is often the case that SO42− binds to the site for the phosphate group of a phosphate-containing ligand in the protein crystal (21Johnson L.N. Barford D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2409-2412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Trapani S. Linss J. Goldenberg S. Fischer H. Craievich A.F. Oliva G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1059-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), this site seemed to be a good candidate for binding with one of the allosteric activators Glc-6-P. In this work, the four Arg residues that are located at or near the binding site of SO42− were replaced by Gln individually or in combination by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting mutant enzymes were investigated for their kinetic properties. Among the four ligands tested, the sensitivity to Glc-6-P was most predominantly diminished or lost, suggesting the involvement of Arg residues in the binding with Glc-6-P and/or in the transmission of allosteric signal caused by Glc-6-P. Although the mutant enzymes could be fully phosphorylated by PEPC kinase, their ability to be activated by regulatory phosphorylation was simultaneously lost. A possible mechanism for this novel finding is also discussed. Enzymes and Chemicals—Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Proligo Primers & Probes. DNA polymerase KOD-plus was purchased from Toyobo. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from either Takara Bio, Inc., or New England Biolabs and were used according to the recommendations from the supplier. Recombinant enterokinase (rEK) was from Novagen. PEPC-k was kindly supplied by Y. Tsuchida of this laboratory (14Tsuchida Y. Furumoto T. Izumida A. Hata S. Izui K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The antibodies for the phosphorylated ZmPEPC had already been prepared in this laboratory (23Ueno Y. Imanari E. Emura J. Yoshizawa-Kumagaye K. Nakajima K. Inami K. Shiba T. Sakakibara H. Sugiyama T. Izui K. Plant J. 2000; 21: 17-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) was from Jackson ImmunoResearch. PEP (tri-cyclohexylammonium salt) and l-malate (sodium salt) were from Sigma and Wako, respectively. 3,3-Dichloro-2-dihydroxyphosphinoylmethyl-2-propenoate (DCDP) (24Jenkins C.L.D. Harris R.L.N. McFadden H.G. Biochem. Int. 1987; 14: 219-226Google Scholar) was obtained as described previously (20Matsumura H. Xie Y. Shirakata S. Inoue T. Yoshinaga T. Ueno Y. Izui K. Kai Y. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 1721-1730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All other materials were of reagent grade, and obtained as described previously (14Tsuchida Y. Furumoto T. Izumida A. Hata S. Izui K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Yano M. Izui K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Dong L.Y. Ueno Y. Hata S. Izui K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1340-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) or purchased from commercial sources. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli XL1-Blue and BL21-Codon-Plus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) were used for amplification of plasmids and expression of PEPCs, respectively. pET32a (Novagen) was used as an expression vector. pTM94 and pEM94 (27Dong L.Y. Hata S. Izui K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 545-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which contain the entire coding region of the cDNA of ZmPEPC, were used as starting materials. During the course of this study, many errors were found in the sequence that had been reported by us previously (28Izui K. Ishijima S. Yamaguchi Y. Katagiri F. Murata T. Shigesada K. Sugiyama T. Katsuki H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 1615-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 29Yanagisawa S. Izui K. Yamaguchi Y. Shigesada K. Katsuki H. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus we re-determined and revised the sequence (Fig. 1). We constructed the following pTM94 and pEM94 derivatives in this work, pTMR183Q, pTMR184Q, pTMR183Q/R184Q, pTMR231Q, pTMR372Q, pEMR183Q, pEMR184Q, pEMR183Q/R184Q, pEMR231Q, and pEMR372Q. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the overlap extension method using PCR (30Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6849) Google Scholar). The pairs of primers used for substitution of amino acids were as follows: 5′-CATCCCACGCAGTCCGCCCagCGCTCG-3′ and 5′-GGAGCGAGCGctGGGCGGACTGCG-3′ for pTMR183Q; 5′-GTCCGCCCGCCagTCGCTCCTGC-3′ and 5′-CTGCAGGAGCGActGGCGGGCGG-3′ for pTMR184Q; 5′-CCCACGCAGTCCGCCCagCagTCGCTCC-3′ and 5′-GCAGGAGCGActGctGGGCGGACTGCG-3′ for pTMR183Q/R184Q; 5′-CTGATGAAATCcaGAGGGCACAACCC-3′ and 5′-GGTGGGTTGTGCCCTCtgGATTTCATC-3′ for pTMR231Q; and 5′-CCAAACGAGCCCTACCaGGTGATACTAGGC-3′ and 5′-CTAGTATCACCtGGTAGGGCTCGTTTGG-3′ for pTMR372Q. The upstream and downstream primers were 5′-CTCGTGTCCGAGGTCGGCAAGTCC-3′ and 5′-CTGTGGAGCTCTTCGGCACGAACA-3′ (for pTMR183Q, pTMR184Q, pTMR183Q/R184Q, and pTMR-231Q) and 5′-CCTAAGTTCTTGCGCCGTGTGG-3′ and 5′-CCGTCACACGGATGGACCCGT-3′ (for pTMR372Q). The mutation sites are described in lowercase letters. The plasmid pTM94 was used as a template, and amplification was performed by KOD-plus DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's protocol. After cloning of the amplified mutagenic fragments into pBluescript KS(-)/EcoRV, the sequences of the fragments were confirmed. The cloned fragments then were excised by double digestion with BstPI and NspV and inserted into the BstPI-NspV site of pTM94 (for pTMR183Q, pTMR184Q, pTMR183Q/R184Q, and pTMR231Q). The plasmid pTMR372Q was constructed in the same way as above using Tth111I-ClaI fragments. For high level expression and convenient purification of the recombinant enzymes, the NcoI-HindIII fragments containing the full coding region of PEPC were cut out from pTMR183Q, pTMR184Q, pTMR183Q/R184Q, pTMR231Q, and pTMR372Q. Then the coding region of the wild-type PEPC in a pET plasmid, pEM94, was replaced by these mutant fragments to produce pEMR183Q, pEMR184Q, pEMR183Q/R184Q, pEMR231Q, and pEMR372Q. Expression and Purification of Recombinant PEPCs—The cells of E. coli F15, a recA variant of the ppc deletion mutant (31Cunin R. Boyen A. Pouels P. Glansdorff N. Crabeel M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 140: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which had been transformed with pTM94 or the mutant plasmids derived from it, were grown in a minimal glucose-salts medium for complementation testing. If a PEPC coded by the introduced plasmid exerts enough activity in cells, the phenotype of the glutamate requirement is complemented (25Yano M. Izui K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For the preparation of PEPCs for enzymological studies, the transformants (BL21/pEM94, BL21/pEMR183Q, BL21/pEMR184Q, BL21/pEMR183Q/R184Q, BL21/pEMR231Q, and BL21/pEMR372) were first spread on an LB plate containing ampicillin (100 μg ml-1). A single colony of each transformant was selected, inoculated into 20 ml of LB supplemented with 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin, and incubated with shaking at 37 °C overnight. The culture was added to 1 liter of LB and incubated with shaking at 37 °C until the OD660 reached 0.6. The expression of the fusion protein was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside and grown at 25 °C for 4-6 h. The cells collected by centrifugation were washed once with a Wash Buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), resuspended in 15 ml of Wash Buffer, and then disrupted with a French press (Ohtake Seisakusho Co.). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was fractionated with 30-60% saturated ammonium sulfate. The resulting protein precipitate was dissolved in a Start Buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 20%(v/v) ethylene glycol, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (Millipore). The solution was loaded on a Ni2+-chelated HiTrap Chelating HP column (1 ml) (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion enzyme was eluted with 10 ml of Elution Buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1 m NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 20%(v/v) ethylene glycol, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), and the eluate was then collected in two 5-ml fractions. The first 5-ml fraction contained most of the purified protein, as determined by absorption at 280 nm as well as the presence of the expected 127-kDa band (with 17 kDa tags) on an SDS-PAGE (data not shown). This fusion protein was collected and precipitated with 60% saturated ammonium sulfate with an ammonium sulfate-saturated buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), ammonium sulfate) at 4 °C overnight. The fusion protein was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, dissolved in Storage Buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol) (32Ogawa N. Kai T. Yabuta N. Izui K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 76-80Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and kept at -20 °C. Each 1 liter of bacterial culture yielded ∼2 mg of ∼98% pure protein. The purified enzymes were stable for at least 10 days under these conditions. Before use, the fusion enzyme solution was freed from ethylene glycol by a Sephadex G-50 Fine (Amersham Biosciences) spin column, which had been equilibrated with Wash Buffer and then incubated for 1 h on ice in the presence of 1 mm DTT for full reactivation. Trimming of Tag Polypeptide from Fusion Protein of PEPC—Because the PEPC was expressed as a fusion protein by the pET system (Novagen) using pET32-a as a vector (24Jenkins C.L.D. Harris R.L.N. McFadden H.G. Biochem. Int. 1987; 14: 219-226Google Scholar), the N-terminal tag of 159 amino acid residues was trimmed off by rEK for most experiments. The digestion mixture contained, in a total volume of 60 μl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm CaCl2, 0.5% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 5 mm Gly, 10 mm l-malate (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 80 μg of fusion PEPC, and 0.2 units of rEK. After the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 4 h, the reaction was terminated by adding 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Pefabloc SCv, Roche Applied Science). The digested products were applied to a Sephadex G-50 Fine spin column for removal of the short tag polypeptide. In Vitro Regulatory Phosphorylation of PEPC—Phosphorylation reactions were carried out at 25 °C for 1 h in a reaction mixture (80 μl in total) containing 0.1 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.04% (w/v) Tween 20, 20 mm DTT, 4 μg of recombinant Flaveria trinervia PEPC-k (14Tsuchida Y. Furumoto T. Izumida A. Hata S. Izui K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and 40 μg of PEPC. At various intervals 10-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn and added to tubes containing 5 μl of 500 mm EDTA to stop the reaction. The phosphorylation was monitored by Western blot analysis using antibodies specific to the phosphorylated Ser-15 of ZmPEPC (23Ueno Y. Imanari E. Emura J. Yoshizawa-Kumagaye K. Nakajima K. Inami K. Shiba T. Sakakibara H. Sugiyama T. Izui K. Plant J. 2000; 21: 17-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was the peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L), and the signals were detected as chemiluminescence by the use of BMG chemiluminescence blotting substrate for peroxidase (Roche Applied Science) with LAS-1000plus (Fuji Film). To quantitate the extent of phosphorylation per mol of subunit, phosphorylation was monitored by the incorporation of radioactive phosphate into PEPC from [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixture was the same as described above except for the use of 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 μCi). Procedures for the measurement of 32P incorporation into PEPC were the same as described previously (14Tsuchida Y. Furumoto T. Izumida A. Hata S. Izui K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Measurement of PEPC Activity—PEPC activity was measured by a coupled spectrophotometric method (33Ueno Y. Hata S. Izui K.

One unit of the enzyme activity was defined as 1 μmol of oxaloacetate formed per min at 30 °C. The standard assay mixture contained, in a total volume of 1.0 ml, 100 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3), 2 mm PEP, 10 mm KHCO3, 10 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm NADH, 1.5 units of malate dehydrogenase, and the enzyme (0.5-1 μg). The reaction was initiated by the addition of PEP. The protein concentration was routinely determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) based on dye binding (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar) with crystalline bovine serum albumin as a standard. When necessary, the molar concentration of the ZmPEPC subunit was estimated from its molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm, i.e. 7.5 × 104m-1 cm-1. The value had been determined previously by amino acid analysis of the acid hydrolysate of PEPC in a solution of known absorbance. 2Y. Ueno, Y. Yagi, and K. Izui, unpublished data. (More simply, the PEPC concentration of 1.0 mg per ml estimated by the dye-binding method as above corresponds to an absolute concentration of 0.72 mg per ml, and this solution gives an absorbance of 0.500 at 280 nm. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data—Calculation of PEPC kinetic constants was performed by fitting the initial velocities to the appropriate equation described below using the commercial computing program Kaleidagraph (Synergy software, version 3.52) (35Tovar-Méndez A. Mújica-Jiménez C. Muñoz-Clares R.A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Kinetic data were fitted to Equation 1 for substrate and to Equation 2 and Equation 3 for activator and inhibitor respectively, v=Vmax[S]n/(S0.5n+[S]n)(Eq. 1) v=v0+{(va,max−v0)[A]n/(A0.5n+[A]n)}(Eq. 2) v=v0+{(va,max−v0)[A]n/(A0.5n+[A]n)}v=v0−{(v0−vi,min)[I]n/(I0.5n+[I]n)}(Eq. 3) where v is the initial velocity; Vmax is the apparent maximal velocity; S0.5 and A0.5 are the concentrations of substrate S and activator A, respectively, giving an apparent half of the maximal velocity; n is the Hill coefficient; va,max is the highest velocity attainable at saturating activator concentrations; va,min is the lowest velocity attainable at saturating inhibitor concentration; and I0.5 is the concentration of an inhibitor I at apparent half-maximum inhibition. Functional Competition between Glc-6-P and Sulfate—Although the binding of the sulfate anion with PEPC was ascertained by x-ray crystallographic analysis, there have been no functional data suggesting that the sulfate-binding site is identical with the allosteric regulatory site for Glc-6-P. If sulfate behaves simply as an analogue of the phosphate group, the binding sites for Glc-6-P and PEP would both be candidates for binding with sulfate. Thus kinetic experiments were performed to investigate the effect of increasing concentrations of ammonium sulfate on the saturation curves of Glc-6-P and PEP. As shown in Fig. 3, the activation by Glc-6-P tended to diminish with an increase of ammonium sulfate concentration, and almost complete desensitization was brought about at the concentration of 0.2 m, the concentration at which crystallization had been carried out (20Matsumura H. Xie Y. Shirakata S. Inoue T. Yoshinaga T. Ueno Y. Izui K. Kai Y. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 1721-1730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a robust PEP dependence could be observed, and the S0.5 and Vmax values in the presence of 0.2 m ammonium sulfate were decreased to 67 and 31% of those measured in the absence of sulfate (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the site for Glc-6-P was occupied by sulfate, but the site for PEP was not under the crystallization conditions. An apparent decrease of the S0.5 value was rather unexpected under the conditions of high ionic strength. This could reflect an allosteric-type behavior caused by sulfate bound at the site for Glc-6-P. We had earlier made similar observations regarding E. coli PEPC, whose allosteric activator is fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) instead of Glc-6-P (37Kodaki T. Fujita N. Kameshita I. Izui K. Katsuki H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 38Izui K. Fujita N. Katsuki H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 92: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Preparation of Mutant Enzymes—As shown in Fig. 2, the basic residues located at or near the sulfate-binding site are Arg-183, Arg-184, Arg-231, and Arg-372′ (of adjacent subunit). We replaced these Arg residues individually, and in combination for the consecutive residues, with Gln residues. Gln residue was chosen because its physicochemical properties were the most similar to the Arg residue except for its electric charge. The mutant enzymes are denoted as R183Q, R184Q, R231Q, R372Q, and R183Q/R184Q hereafter. First, in order to test the activities of these mutant enzymes in vivo, a complementation test was performed with an E. coli mutant (F15) in which the gene for PEPC (ppc) was deleted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For the expression of wild-type (WT) and mutant PEPCs, a cDNA expression vector of pTV119N (Takara Bio, Inc.) was employed. The plasmid pTM94 carries the cDNA for WT ZmPEPC (33Ueno Y. Hata S. Izui K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, WT, R184Q, and R231Q were able to complement, whereas R183Q, R183Q/R184Q, and R372Q could not (data not shown). Thus, the latter three mutant enzymes were not sufficiently active to support the growth or were not stable enough to be accumulated in the F15 cells. The WT and mutant enzymes were expressed in the pET system and purified to homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures”. Because Arg-372′ on the adjacent subunit is located at the interface of two monomers in close contact and can interact with Ser-185 of the counter subunit (20Matsumura H. Xie Y. Shirakata S. Inoue T. Yoshinaga T. Ueno Y. Izui K. Kai Y. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 1721-1730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, B and C), a tetrameric structure was suspected to be destabilized in R372Q. In fact, gel filtration analysis of the purified R372Q enzyme (Smart System with a Superose 6 column; Amersham Biosciences) showed a weak tendency of dissociation to give a small peak that presumably corresponded to a monomer, but more than 90% of the enzyme retained a tetrameric structure (data not shown). Although the enzyme purified with a Ni2+-affinity column is a fusion protein having tags of 159 amino acid residues at the N terminus, our previous studies (26Dong L.Y. Ueno Y. Hata S. Izui K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1340-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 27Dong L.Y. Hata S. Izui K. Biosci. Biotechnol.

Accordingly, several preliminary experiments we"

However, the mechanism that safeguards against inadvertent caspase activation is not well understood. Previous studies have suggested that the activation of procaspase-8 is mediated by cross-cleavage of precursor dimers, formed upon apoptosis induction, which are not only enzymatically competent but also highly susceptible to cleavage, and that procaspase-8 activation is a linear process without self-amplification. Effector procaspases constitutively exist as dimers and their activation is started by trans-cleavage by an initiator caspase followed by autocleavage of effector caspases. Here we show that the dimerization of caspase-3 molecules through their protease domains is required for their processing by initiator caspases. The subsequent autoprocessing takes place through cleavage between the dimeric intermediates. Moreover, mature caspase-3 fails to process its own precursor. Thus, despite a marked difference in the generation of active intermediates, the activation of initiator and effector caspases shares the features of interdimer cleavage and lack of self-amplification. These features may be important in preventing accidental cell death.

Thus, despite a marked difference in the generation of active intermediates, the activation of initiator and effector caspases shares the features of interdimer cleavage and lack of self-amplification. These features may be important in preventing accidental cell death. Apoptosis or programmed cell death is executed by caspases, intracellular cysteine proteases that cleave proteins after aspartic acid residues (1Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar, 2Chang H.Y. Yang X. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Yuan J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8543-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). The proteases are synthesized as inert precursors comprised of an NH2-terminal prodomain followed by a characteristic caspase domain that can be further divided into a large (∼20 kDa, p20) and a small (p10) subunit. p20 and p10 are found in mature caspases arranged as a homodimer of the p20:p10 heterodimer or (p20:p10)2. The conversion from a procaspase to a mature caspase generally requires two sequential cleavage events with the first one separating p20 and p10 followed by a second cleavage separating p20 from the prodomain. Caspase activation usually occurs as a cascade of initiator and effector caspases. Initiator caspases, including human caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10, contain relatively long prodomains that facilitate their interaction with death adaptor proteins and are autoproteolytically activated in large protein complexes. One major caspase-activating complex is the cytosolic apoptosome, which is formed through the binding of cytochrome c to a death adaptor, Apaf-1, in response to various intracellular death stimuli (5Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Additionally, the membrane-bound death-inducing signaling complex is assembled upon the binding of death receptors to their ligands or agonistic antibodies (6Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S.H. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). The apoptosome and death-inducing signaling complex activate procaspase-9 and -8, respectively (7Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6279) Google Scholar, 8Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

Once activated, caspase-9 and -8 then process effector caspases, including caspase-3, -6, and -7, which have short prodomains (10–30 amino acids). Effector caspases, especially caspase-3, are responsible for most of the cleavage events observed during apoptosis. The caspase cascade ensures quick generation of large amounts of active caspases to irreversibly damage cells upon apoptosis induction. At the same time, the deadly outcome of this cascade demands that it be tightly regulated. The mechanism whereby this pathway is safeguarded from accidental activation is not clear. The activation of initiator caspases is induced by their oligomerization. This was originally shown for caspase-8 (10Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol.

Recent studies have shed important light on the mechanism whereby initiator caspases, particularly procaspase-8, are activated by oligomerization. The defining step in the activation of procaspase-8 is the formation of precursor dimers through a stable interaction between the protease domains (19Chang D.W. Xing Z. Capacio V.L. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 20Donepudi M. Sweeney A.M. Briand C. Grutter M.G. Mol.

Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). These dimers are structurally similar to the mature caspase-8 and acquire strong proteolytic activity. Importantly, the procaspase-8 dimers are highly susceptible to cleavage themselves by other dimers compared with individual procaspase-8, leading to interdimer processing for the generation of mature caspase-8 (19Chang D.W. Xing Z. Capacio V.L. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus, this mechanism requires minimally four procaspase-8 molecules being brought into close proximity to achieve caspase-8 cleavage. The fact that dimeric procaspase-8 rather than individual caspase-8 is the active unit for activation also enables an intriguing mode of regulation through a proteolytically inactive procaspase-8 homologue, c-FLIPL, which induces strong protease activity in procaspase-8 upon their heterodimerization (21Chang D.W. Xing Z. Pan Y. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Barnhart B.C. Yaish-Ohad S. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3704-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Moreover, the activation of procaspase-8 is a linear event; the active procaspase-8 dimers process only themselves and not effector caspases, whereas mature caspase-8 cleaves effector procaspase but not its own precursor (19Chang D.W. Xing Z. Capacio V.L. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The interdimer processing and the lack of positive feedback, as opposed to cleavage between individual procaspases and a self-amplification loop, minimize the chance of accidental caspase activation. In contrast to the autoactivation of initiator caspases, the activation of effector caspases is a combination of both trans- and autoactivation (22Martin S.J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Shi L. Chuang T.H. Casiano C.A. O'Brien G.A. Fitzgerald P. Tan E.M. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg A.H. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2407-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 23Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C.

A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Different from initiator caspases, which exist as monomers prior to apoptosis induction, effector procaspases constitutively form dimers likely because of the strong hydrophobic nature of the dimer interface in these caspases (24Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). These precursor dimers, however, are inactive because of the structural constraints imposed by the covalent link between the large and small subunits. A cleavage of this link by an initiator caspase allows for re-ordering of catalytic and substrate-binding residues to form proper active sites, generating an enzymatically competent intermediate (25Shi Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 855-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 26Chai J. Wu Q. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14790-14795Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This intermediate then undergoes autoproteolytic processing to separate the large subunit from the prodomain. In this study, we show that like the activation of procaspase-8, the dimerization of procaspase-3 is required for it to be cleaved. In addition, the second, autocatalytic step takes place between partially processed procaspase-3 dimers. Furthermore, mature caspase-3 does not effectively process its own precursor. Therefore, despite the difference in the generation of the dimeric intermediate, the activation of initiator caspases and effector caspases are similar with regards to autoproteolytic processing between these enzymatically active dimers and the lack of self-amplification. Reagents—Active caspase-3, -6, -7, -8 and -9 (Chemicon International), rabbit heart cytochrome c (Sigma), and ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) (EGS) 1The abbreviation used is: EGS, ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate). (Pierce) were purchased from the indicated sources. Plasmids—All plasmids for in vitro transcription/translation were constructed in pRK5 vector with NH2- or COOH-terminal epitope tags as indicated. All caspase-3 mutations were made by overlap polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Primers used for mutagenesis were 5′-CTGGAGACCCCAAACTTTTCATTA (M1), 5′-GCCAAGTTCTTGTATGCATACTCCACA (M2), 5′-TTTGACGTCACTTTTCATGCAAAG (M3), 5′-TCAGTGGCTAGCAAATCCATTAAAAATTTG and 5′-TGGATTTGCTAGCCACTGAGTTTTCAGTG (D9A), and 5′-GCGAATCCATGGCCTCTGGAATATCCCTGGAC and 5′-CCAGAGGCCATGGATTCGCTTCCATGTATG (D18A). The caspase-9 expression plasmids were described previously (18Chang D.W. Ditsworth D. Liu H. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Yang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16466-16469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Chemical Cross-linking—[35S]Methionine-labeled wild type and mutant procaspase-3 proteins were made using a coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The caspase-3 proteins were passed through Centricon column YM-10 (Amersham Biosciences) to change the buffer to 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The EGS stock solutions were made in Me2SO. 4.5 μl of the caspase protein sample was mixed with 0.5 μl of 0.25 mm EGS stock or Me2SO and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by the direct addition of the same volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Caspase-processing Reaction—All caspase-processing reactions were done with 2 μl of the in vitro translated procaspases and 0.5 μl of active caspases for 2 h at 37 °C unless otherwise indicated. Mutations in Procaspase-3 That Affect Its Self-association— Effector procaspases such as caspase-3 constitutively exist as dimers in cells (24Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H.

A previous study has shown that induced dimerization of procaspase-8 is required not only for the acquisition of protease activity but also for its processing by other active procaspase-8 dimers (19Chang D.W. Xing Z. Capacio V.L. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To examine whether the dimerization of effector procaspases is requisite for their cleavage by initiator caspases, we generated point mutations that abolished the self-association of procaspase-3. Based on the crystal structure of active caspase-3 (28Rotonda J. Nicholson D.W. Fazil K.M. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Labelle M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Ruel R. Vaillancourt J.P. Thornberry N.A. Becker J.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), we mutated three amino acids located at the interface of the two p17:p12 heterodimers to those of the opposite charges, resulting in interface mutants, K154D(M1), D192K(M2), and K260D(M3) (Fig. 1A). The dimeric state of these mutants was examined by chemical cross-linking using EGS and SDS-PAGE analysis. In agreement with previous studies, wild type procaspase-3 preformed dimers as shown by the appearance of a procaspase-3 band of ∼60 kDa in the presence but not the absence of EGS (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the M1 and M2 mutants significantly impeded procaspase-3 homodimerization (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–6), whereas the M3 mutant had only a minor effect (lanes 7 and 8). Processing of Procaspase-3 by Initiator Caspases Requires Its Dimerization—We next examined the processing of these mutants by active caspase-8. As expected, wild type procaspase-3 was readily cleaved by active caspase-8, generating fragments corresponding to a processing intermediate (p20, which has both p17 and the prodomain) and the active caspase-3 subunits p17 and p12 (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 3, and 13). The processing of p20 to p17 happened at Asp-28 rather than Asp-9 in the prodomain (Fig. 2A, lanes 15 and 17), consistent with previous results (22Martin S.J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Shi L. Chuang T.H.

In comparison, the processing of the M1 and M2 mutants was significantly impaired, and the processing of the M3 mutant was only slightly affected (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained when active, recombinant caspase-9 was used to cleave caspase-3 (Fig. 2B). Thus, the processing of these procaspase-3 mutants by caspase-8 and -9 correlated well with ability of these mutants to form dimers. The recombinant, active caspase-9 was comprised of the large and small subunits. However, during apoptosis, the prodomain of procaspase-9 is not separated from its large subunits and the apoptosome-bound, processed caspase-9 has much higher activity toward caspase-3 than the unbound caspase-9 does (30Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). We thus tested the processing of procaspase-3 by apoptosome-activated caspase-9. Procaspase-9 in S100 cell extracts can be induced to undergo self-processing upon the addition of cytochrome c and dATP or ATP (7Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6279) Google Scholar). We developed a convenient system to activate procaspase-9 using in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled procaspase-9. The addition of cytochrome c to the in vitro translation mix led to the processing of procaspase-9 (Fig. 2C), likely mediated by an Apaf-1 homologue in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate. ATP was present in the lysate to allow for transcription and translation to occur; therefore, it was not a variable in our experiments. Similar to the processing of procaspase-9 in the S100 cell extracts, the activation of caspase-9 in this system was autoproteolytic in nature, because an active site Cys → Ala mutant failed to be processed (Fig. 2C, lane 4), and it occurred at the previously determined amino acid residues (15Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 31Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), because mutations of these residues completely abolished procaspase-9 processing (lane 6). The cytochrome c-activated caspase-9 processed procaspase-3 and to a lesser extent, the caspase-3 M3 mutant, but it did not cleave the procaspase-3 mutants M1 and M2 (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results show that the stable association of procaspase-3 through its protease domain is required for its processing by initiator caspases. Caspase-3 Autocleavage Occurs between Partially Processed Dimers—Following the severance of p17 and p12 by initiator caspases, the separation of p17 and the prodomain is carried out by caspase-3 itself. Because the autoactivation of procaspase-8 takes place through interdimer cleavage, we sought to determine whether the autoactivation step during caspase-3 activation proceeds similarly between the p20/p12 dimers. Cleavage of the proteolytically inactive procaspase-3(C/S) by caspase-8 yielded mainly the (p20/p12)2 intermediates because of its inability to self-process (22Martin S.J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Shi L. Chuang T.H. Casiano C.A. O'Brien G.A. Fitzgerald P. Tan E.M. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg A.H. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2407-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A, lane 8). However, when procaspase-3(C/S) was treated with caspase-8 in the presence of wild type procaspase-3, procaspase-3(C/S) was further processed into p17 and p12 (Fig. 3A, lane 5), similar to the processing of wild type procaspase-3 (lane 2), suggesting that the wild type caspase-3 p20/12 dimers can process the caspase-3(C/S) p20/p12 dimers. To rule out the possibility that the caspase-3(C/S) p20/12 dimers were cleaved by the fully processed wild type caspase-3, we treated procaspase-3(C/S) with active caspase-3 and/or caspase-8. Active caspase-3 did not process its own precursor (Fig. 3B, lane 4, also see below) nor did it process the p20 intermediate generated by caspase-8 cleavage (lanes 2 versus 1). Therefore, we concluded that the second cleavage event during caspase-3 activation takes place between the p20/p12 dimers. Mature Caspase-3 Does Not Effectively Process Its Own Precursor—The processing of procaspase happens at aspartic acid residues, which conform to the substrate recognition consensus of caspase. Thus, caspase activation may be subject to positive feedback. The activation of initiator caspases such as caspase-8, however, does not show such regulation, because the mature caspase-8 is not able to process its own precursor. To examine whether this is also the case for effector caspases, we compared the processing of procaspase-3 by mature caspase-3 and by other initiator and effector caspases. As shown in Fig. 4A, procaspase-3 was effectively cleaved by mature caspase-8 as well as by caspase-1, -6, and -9, as predicted. However, mature caspase-3 showed little, if any, activity toward its own precursor even though it effectively cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, an established caspase-3 substrate (32Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Therefore, the activation of procaspase-3, like that of procaspase-8, is a linear process. The caspase proteolytic system fits well with the terminal nature of apoptosis with its abilities to irreversibly affect a large number of substrates and to quickly amplify the death signal through cascades of initiator and effector caspases. As this system is universally present in healthy animal cells, it must be tightly controlled to prevent accidental activation. Effector caspases represent the majority of active caspases in apoptotic cells and are responsible for most of the protein cleavages that give rise to the stereotypic morphological changes during apoptosis (1Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar, 2Chang H.Y. Yang X. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 821-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6191) Google Scholar, 4Degterev A. Boyce M. Yuan J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8543-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that like the activation of caspase-8, the cleavage of caspase-3 requires its dimerization and occurs through cleavage between the active intermediates. In addition, mature caspase-3 does not efficiently process its own precursors, and its activation is unlikely to involve a loop of self-amplification. Therefore, the activation of initiator and effector procaspases shares important features of interdimer processing and linearity (Fig. 5). These features would significantly enhance the specific activation of effector caspases by initiator caspases and decrease the probability of undesired activation of these caspases. The interdimer processing of caspase-3 requires at least two caspase-3 dimers to be in close proximity to complete its activation. Although effector procaspases cannot effectively form active sites, an early study has indicated that a small portion of procaspase-3 is enzymatically competent (33Roy S. Bayly C.I. Gareau Y. Houtzager V.M. Kargman S. Keen S.L. Rowland K. Seiden I.M. Thornberry N.A. Nicholson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The reason for this activity is not understood but conceivably could be because of dynamic changes in the structure of procaspase-3 dimers. The interdimer processing mechanism would prevent these scarce active dimers from undergoing self-cleavage. An elusive feature of effector caspases is the presence of the short prodomains (10–30 amino acids). In vitro studies have revealed little, if any, difference in enzymatic characteristics of mature effector molecules with and without the prodomain attached to the large subunit (29Stennicke H.R. Jurgensmeier J.M. Shin H. Deveraux Q. Wolf B.B. Yang X. Zhou Q. Ellerby H.M. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Green D.R. Reed J.C. Froelich C.J. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27084-27090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). However, in many cases, the removal of this prodomain is a requisite step for apoptosis induction (34Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The present work suggests an interesting possibility for the function of these prodomains; the presence of the prodomain demands a second cleavage, occurring between partially processed effector caspase dimers, to complete effector caspase activation. Thus, it helps prevent inappropriate activation of these caspases. Moreover, this interdimer processing mechanism also predicts that the activation of procaspase-3 is highly sensitive to its concentration, and its processing by initiator caspases during apoptosis may involve its enrichment near the complex where initiator procaspases are activated. To this end, previous studies have shown that procaspase-3 may be recruited to the apoptosome (15Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 35Hill M.M. Adrain C. Duriez P.J. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2134-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Caspase activation has long been regarded as a self-amplifying process. However, recent studies have indicated that mature caspase-8 does not process its own precursor (19Chang D.W. Xing Z. Capacio V.L. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 36Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46639-46646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The present work suggests that caspase-3 does not possess this ability to activate its own precursor either. Therefore, the activation of each caspase per se may not be subjected to a positive feedback mechanism. The interdimer processing mechanism for both initiator and effector caspases and the lack of self-amplification for activation of each caspase, in combination with the caspase cascade, allow for effective caspase activation during apoptosis while minimizing inadvertent activation in healthy cells.

Constructs of Tea2 containing the motor domain only or the motor domain plus the N-terminal extension are monomeric, whereas a construct including the first predicted coiled coil region is dimeric. These constructs have a low basal rate of ATP hydrolysis of <0.1 s–1, but microtubules stimulate the rate of ATP hydrolysis to a maximum of ∼15 s–1. Hydrodynamic analysis of Mal3 indicates that it is dimeric. Mal3 is known to associate with Tea2, and analysis with the above Tea2 constructs indicates that the principal site of interaction of Mal3 with Tea2 is the N-terminal extension, although a weaker interaction is also observed with the motor domain alone. In parallel to the binding studies, Mal3 strongly stimulates the ATPase of constructs containing the N-terminal extension by decreasing the K0.5(MT) for stimulation by microtubules but only weakly stimulates motor domains without the N-terminal extension. Mal3 reduces the K0.5(MT) values without affecting the kcat value at saturating microtubule level. Binding of Mal3 to microtubules induces an increase in the binding of Tea2 and a reciprocal stimulation of Mal3 binding by Tea2 is also observed. Tea2 is a plus end directed motor that drives sliding of axonemes when adsorbed to a glass surface.

The sliding rate is initially unaffected by Mal3, but axonemes stop moving on continued exposure to Mal3. Fission yeast have a complex system for defining the positions of the ends of their elongated cells and for controlling the rate of growth at the new and old end following cell division (see Refs. 1.Niccoli T. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1651-1662PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Chang F. Peter M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3.Sawin K.E. Snaith H.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar and references therein). The kinesin family member Tea2 plays an important role in this process. It was first identified in a screen for morphology mutants (4.Verde F. Mata J. Nurse P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and later discovered to be identical to a kinesin gene, klp4, that was identified by a search for kinesin family members in Schizosaccharomyces pombe by reverse PCR (5.Browning H. Hayles J. Mata J. Aveline L. Nurse P. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The Tea2 protein is localized in large clusters at the tips of the cell and also in punctate dots within the cell that are coincident with the ends of cytoplasmic microtubules (MTs) 1The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; Nte, N-terminal extension; Trx, thioredoxin; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; ACES, 2-[(2-amino-2-oxoethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate.

Cell. 2004; 6: 831-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Tea2 has a conserved kinesin motor domain with an N-terminal extension of 120 amino acids and a C-terminal region that includes two predicted coiled coil regions and a C terminus that is not predicted to be coiled coil (5.Browning H. Hayles J. Mata J. Aveline L. Nurse P. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Other proteins that interact with Tea2 include Mal3, Tip1, and Tea1. Mal3 is a homolog of EB1 (End Binding protein 1) that was originally discovered as a binding partner of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor at the ends of MTs (see Ref. 9.Tirnauer J.S. Bierer B.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar for review of EB1). EB1 proteins have a calponin homology domain at the N-terminal that binds to MTs and the structure of this domain has recently been solved by crystallography (10.Hayashi I. Ikura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36430-36434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of EB1 contains a predicted coiled coil that is likely responsible for oligomerization and a conserved domain that mediates interaction with a number of other proteins. EB1 also plays a role in attachment of MT ends to kinetochores (11.Tirnauer J.S. Canman J.C. Salmon E.D. Mitchison T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4308-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and in targeting to the minus ends of MTs at the centrosome. Tip1 is a homolog of CLIP-170 (see Ref. 12.Brunner D. Nurse P. Cell. 2000; 102: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar for review of CLIP-170 family and homology to Tip1). CLIP-170 in higher cells localizes to the growing plus ends of MTs where it reduces the frequency of catastrophes and can link the MTs to specialized membrane structures. The CLIP-170 family also contains an N-terminal MT binding domain and a C-terminal coiled coil that is involved in protein-protein interactions. Tea1 is a large multidomain protein that is localized to the cell ends and plays a key role in marking the cell end and in directing the growth machinery to the cell tip (13.Mata J. Nurse P. Cell. 1997; 89: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Using fluorescently labeled Tea2 in live cells, it was observed that “dots” containing multipleTea2 molecules were present at the ends of MTs and that these dots moved with the growing MT ends (7.Browning H. Hackney D.D. Nurse P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). When the growing MT reached the cell end, part of the dot of Tea2 was deposited and remained attached to the cell end on retraction of the MT by depolymerization. Tea1, Mal3, and Tip1 also accumulate at the plus ends of growing MTs and move with the ends of polymerizing MTs to the cell tip where Tea1 and Tip1, but not Mal3, are deposited (7.Browning H. Hackney D.D. Nurse P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12.Brunner D. Nurse P.

These proteins interact physically as well. Tea2 binds to Mal3 as indicated by coimmunoprecipitation (7.Browning H. Hackney D.D. Nurse P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8.Busch K.E. Hayles J. Nurse P. Brunner D. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 831-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Tea2 also binds to Tip1 through the coiled coil region of Tip1 (8.Busch K.E. Hayles J. Nurse P. Brunner D. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 831-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and this interaction requires the coiled coil region of Tea2. 2H. Browning and D. D. Hackney, unpublished data. In addition, Bik1 and Bim1, the budding yeast homologs of Tip1 and Mal3, interact through their coiled coil domains (16.Newman J.R. Wolf E. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13203-13208Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17.Carvalho P. Gupta Jr., M.L. Hoyt M.A. Pellman D. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 815-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and interaction has more recently been observed between Tip1 and Mal3 themselves (15.Busch K.E. Brunner D. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 548-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Analysis of mutant phenotypes indicates that Mal3 plays a central role in targeting these proteins to the MTs ends. Targeting of Mal3 to the MT end is independent of Tea2 or Tip1, but Mal3 is required for targeting of Tea2 and Tip1 (7.Browning H. Hackney D.D. Nurse P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8.Busch K.E. Hayles J. Nurse P. Brunner D. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 831-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Human EB1 can substitute for Mal3 to restore accumulation of Tea2 at the MT end, (7.Browning H. Hackney D.D. Nurse P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and Mal3 can substitute for at least some functions of EB1 (18.Nakamura M. Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1062-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19.Beinhauer J.D. Hagan I.M. Hegemann J.H. Fleig U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Because of limited sensitivity, previous work in cells focused on observation of the large assemblies (dots) that have multiple copies of the fluorescently labeled components in the same location and are therefore bright and punctate. Recently it has become possible to observe smaller accumulations of these proteins as speckles (8.Busch K.E. Hayles J. Nurse P. Brunner D. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 831-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This has indicated that speckles containing fluorescently labeled Tea2 do move actively with a variable rate. Their movements are mainly, but not exclusively, toward the plus ends of the MTs. Moving speckles are also observed with fluorescently labeled Tip1; the Tip1 speckles colocalize with speckles of Tea2, and their movement is dependent on Tea2 (8.Busch K.E. Hayles J. Nurse P. Brunner D. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 831-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Similar moving speckles have been observed with the homologous proteins in budding yeast (17.Carvalho P. Gupta Jr., M.L. Hoyt M.A. Pellman D. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 815-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These results have lead to the suggestion that Tip1 is moving as a cargo of Tea2 toward the plus end where it may be deposited as a complex in conjunction with Mal3. Although Mal3 accumulates at MT ends, there is also a large cytoplasmic pool of Mal3 (15.Busch K.E. Brunner D. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 548-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and fluorescently labeled Mal3 is observed along the length of the MTs (7.Browning H. Hackney D.D. Nurse P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8.Busch K.E. Hayles J. Nurse P. Brunner D. Dev.

Biol. 2004; 14: 548-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). As an initial stage in the analysis of how such complex and dynamic assemblies can be generated and targeted to specific cellular locations, we have begun an investigation of the enzymatic and motile properties of Tea2 and how Tea2 is influenced by interaction with Mal3. This has directly demonstrated that Tea2 is a plus end directed motor and that Mal3 stimulates ATP hydrolysis by recruiting Tea2 to the MT, without a significant effect on the kcat at saturating MT levels. Domain fragments of Tea2 were cloned by PCR into a modified pET32 vector (Novagen) that encoded thioredoxin (Trx), a His-tag, a thrombin cleavage site, and a Tev protease cleavage site followed by a BamH1 site for insertion of the Tea2 fragment. The non-fusion proteins obtained by cleavage with Tev protease have the tripeptide GGS appended to the N terminus. T2Nte, T2M, T2MN, and T2NMC1 are indicated schematically in Fig. 1 and encode Tea2 residues 2–122, 124–476, 2–476, and 2–524, respectively. Mal3 encodes residues 2–308. All constructs also have KpnI and SpeI sites encoding GTTS appended to the C terminus, except T2NMC1, which has the sequence GTTSGTEFCA appended to the C terminus. All PCR-derived regions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A His-tagged version of the Tev protease was prepared by the method of Lucast et al. (20.Lucast L.J. Batey R.T. Doudna J.A. BioTechniques. 2001; 30 (548, and 550): 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) using the plasmid TPSN (kindly provided by J. A. Doudna). General procedures for expression and lysis were as described previously (6.Stock M.F. Chu J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52315-52322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21.Stock M.F. Hackney D.D. Vernos I. Methods in Molecular Biology-Kinesin Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 43-48Google Scholar). All solutions containing Tea2 constructs were supplemented with ≥0.1 mm ATP. The Trx fusion proteins were purified on Ni-NTA columns and eluted with a step to 100 mm imidazole in B8 buffer (15 mm Bicine, pH 8.0, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.02% mercaptoethanol) with 400 mm NaCl. Tev protease was added to the peak fractions, and they were then dialyzed for 1–2 days against B8 buffer with 400 mm NaCl to remove imidazole and to allow proteolysis to occur. The cleavage mixture was passed down a Ni-NTA column with the cleaved Tea2 passing through unbound. ATPase assays were performed at 25 °C as described previously (22.Huang T.G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Stock M.F. Hackney D.D. Vernos I. Methods in Molecular Biology-Kinesin Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 65-71Google Scholar) in A25 buffer (25 mm potassium ACES, pH 6.9, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.02% β-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 mm MgATP, 2 mm phosphoenol pyuvate, 0.25 mm NADH, 10 μm taxol (when MTs were present), pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and KCl as indicated. Concentrations of Tea2 and Mal3 are for monomers and MT concentrations are as tubulin heterodimers. Sedimentation and diffusion coefficients were determined by velocity centrifugation in a sucrose gradient and gel filtration, essentially as described previously (6.Stock M.F. Chu J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52315-52322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in A25 buffer supplemented with 25 mm KCl and 200 mm NaCl for Mal3 and 400 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm MgATP for Tea2 constructs. Gel filtration was not performed with the Tea2 constructs because they exhibited partial adsorption during passage down the column. A partial specific volume of 0.73 cm3/g was used in calculations. All measurements were performed in duplicate or greater and agreed to within 5%. Binding of Mal3 to Tea2 Domains—Small columns of Ni-NTA (0.2 ml) were loaded with 0.5 ml of 50 μm of test protein as a fusion with Trx. The columns were washed with 500 mm NaCl and then shifted to 25 mm NaCl. Essentially all the test protein bound to the column. Mal3 (0.2 ml of 11 μm) was then loaded in 25 mm NaCl and washed with a total of 0.8 ml 25 mm NaCl, and these fractions were pooled as the flow-through fraction (FT). The column was then washed with 1-ml volumes of 25, 150, and 300 mm NaCl. Binding of Tea2 and Mal3 to MTs—Samples in A25 buffer with 100 mm NaCl and 10 μm taxol were centrifuged at 20 °C for 25 min at 250,000 × g. An aliquot was removed for the supernatant fraction, and the remainder of the supernatant was aspirated. The tube and surface of the pellet were not rinsed, and the pellet fraction was obtained by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer to the tube. Motility—Attempts to obtain motility of Tea2 constructs by direct adsorption to glass coverslips were unsuccessful. Motility was observed when T2NMC1 was coupled to a segment of the tail of conventional kinesin that is required for tight binding of conventional kinesin-1 to glass surfaces. Coupling via a disulfide bond (24.Kimple M.E. Sondek J. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was between T2NMC1 and a fusion protein of the first PDZ domain of InaD and residues 910–937 of Drosophila kinesin-1. Coverslips were washed with soap and then treated sequentially for >2 h with 2 n KOH and 3 n HCl, rinsed in water, and air-dried. A flow chamber was constructed using double-sided tape. After adsorption of Tea2, the chamber was blocked with 0.4 mg/ml casein in A25 buffer (without mercaptoethanol) with 60 mm KCl and 1 mm MgATP, and then salt-washed sea urchin axonemes were introduced in the same buffer. Motility was observed at room temperature (21–25 °C) by differential interference contrast microscopy following a final flush with the same buffer to remove unadsorbed axonemes. Oligomeric Characterization—Tea2 is similar to BimC and some other kinesin superfamily members in that it is has an N-terminal type motor domain near its N terminus but also has an additional domain (N-terminal extension (Nte)) before the motor domain as indicated in Fig. 1. The rest of the molecule contains two predicted coiled coil regions and a final C-terminal non-coiled coil region. Constructs of the motor domain and adjoining regions were cloned, expressed, and purified to determine the basic enzymatic and motile properties of Tea2 and their interaction with Mal3. T2M is a minimal construct that contains the full motor domain and neck linker and corresponds to monomeric DKH346 or DKH357 of conventional kinesin (25.Jiang W. Stock M. Li X. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and BC62M of BimC (6.Stock M.F. Chu J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52315-52322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). T2NM contains the motor domain plus the Nte (corresponding to monomeric BC1M), and T2NMC1 also includes the first predicted coiled coil region (corresponding to dimeric DKH405). The sedimentation coefficients of T2M, T2NM, and T2NMC1 are 3.4, 3.5, and 5.3 S, respectively. These values are essentially identical to those of the corresponding kinesin-1 and BimC constructs and indicate that T2M and T2NM are monomeric, whereas T2NMC1 is predominantly dimeric at the concentration of >0.1 mg/ml at which the sedimentation was preformed. Mal3 has sedimentation and diffusion coefficients of 3.8 S and 4.5 × 10–7 cm2/s, respectively, which result in a calculated molecular mass of 76 kDa. The predicted mass of a Mal3 monomer is 35.5 kDa, and thus Mal3 is dimeric in solution. These results also indicate that the Mal3 dimer is highly asymmetric. In comparison to the globular standards, Mal3 elutes close to catalase (200 kDa) on gel filtration but shifts dramatically to migrate close to ovalbumin (45 kDa) on sedimentation. Localization of Mal3 Binding Site on Tea2—Previous work indicted that Mal3 bound to Tea2 (7.Browning H. Hackney D.D. Nurse P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8.Busch K.E. Hayles J. Nurse P. Brunner D. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 831-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The site of binding on Tea2 was investigated by measuring the binding of Mal3 to Tea2 constructs attached to a Ni-NTA column as His-tagged fusions with Trx as indicated in Fig. 2. In the absence of a fusion protein or with thioredoxin alone bound to the column, the Mal3 passed through the column without binding. When T2M was bound, much of the Mal3 still passed through, but some was reversibly retained and eluted with increasing salt. With T2NM or with T2Nte, Mal3 was tightly retained by the column and required 150–300 mm NaCl for elution. Thus the Nte is sufficient for tight binding of Mal3, but a weaker interaction with the motor domain alone (T2M) is also observed. MT-stimulated ATPase—MTs stimulate the ATPase rate of Tea2 as illustrated in Fig. 3. There is a progressive increase in MTs affinity for T2M, T2NM, and T2NMC1 as indicated by a decrease in K0.5(MT) for the MT concentration required for half-saturation of the stimulation by MTs when measured at the same ionic strength. With 25 mm KCl, T2NM has a K0.5(MT) value of 0.26 μm, whereas the value for T2M is too weak to accurately measure (Fig. 3B) and the value for T2NMC1 is too tight to accurately measure due to mutual depletion (data not shown). At 100 mm KCl where the binding of T2NM is too weak to measure, T2NMC1 still has a K0.5(MT) value of 1.6 μm (Fig. 3A). Both T2NM and T2NMC1 have kcat values at saturating levels of MTs of ∼15 s–1. Mal3 Stimulates MT-ATPase of Tea2 at Low MT Concentration—Mal3 strikingly stimulates the rate of ATP hydrolysis for T2NM and T2NMC1at subsaturating levels of MTs but has little effect on the kcat value at saturation as indicated in Fig. 3. The magnitude and rate of onset of the activation are illustrated in Fig. 4. The slope of the decrease in NADH absorption with time measures the ATPase rate with the coupled assay system, and the low slope before addition of Mal3 indicates a low ATPase rate. On addition of Mal3, the slope and therefore ATPase rate markedly increases. The onset of the activation is fast and occurs within the few seconds required for the response of the coupled enzyme system (the response to the pulse of ADP illustrates the response time of the assay). The dependence of the activation on the MT concentration is given by the open symbols in Fig. 3, and the results indicate that activation is only observed at subsaturating levels of MTs. Mal3 also stimulates T2M (Fig. 3B) but to a greatly reduced degree. Low amounts of Mal3 are sufficient for maximum stimulation of T2NM and T2NMC1, and even a large excess of Mal3 is not inhibitory as indicated in Fig. 5, A and B. T2M also exhibits a concentration dependent activation by Mal3 (Fig. 5C). Although these experiments had to be performed at different ionic strengths and MT concentrations due to the different affinities of the motors, it is interesting to note that the stimulation of the ATPase by Mal3 saturates at a concentration that is approximately stoichiometric to the concentration of MTs in each case. Thus, this stimulation is likely due to binding of Mal3 along the length of the MT and any specific effect due to preferential interaction of Mal3 with the plus ends would likely be at too low a stoichiometry to contribute significantly to the total rate. At higher ionic strength where the binding of Mal3 and Tea2 to MTs is weaker, greater than stoichiometric amounts of Mal3 are required (data not shown). The activation by Mal3 is not a generalized effect on kinesin motor domains, because addition of Mal3 produces only monotonically increasing inhibition with the DKH357 motor domain of conventional kinesin-1 (Fig. 5C). Mal3 and Tea2 Mutually Recruit Each Other to the MT—The decreased K0.5(MT) value for Tea2 in the presence of Mal3 suggests that Mal3 increases the net affinity of Tea2 for the MT. This is confirmed by direct MT binding studies with T2NM that are summarized in Fig. 6. In the absence of MTs, only trace amounts of Tea2 or Mal3 are observed in the pellet fraction due to carryover of supernatant and adsorption to the walls of the tube (lane 4 in Fig. 6A is a centrifuged pellet, and lane 2 in Fig. 6A is the “pellet” from a mock uncentrifuged sample). Addition of MTs produces an increase in the amount of Tea2 in the pellet (lane 6 in Fig. 6A), but the affinity is weak because of the presence of 100 mm NaCl. Addition of 2.8 μm Mal3 significantly increases the amount of Tea2 bound to the MT (lane 10 in Fig. 6A). Addition of AMP-PNP results in the majority of the Tea2 being bound, either in the absence (Fig. 6A, lane 16) or presence of Mal3 (Fig. 6A, lanes 12 and 14). This increase in binding of Tea2 is also illustrated by lanes 2–5 in Fig. 6B with increasing amounts of Mal3. The binding of Tea2 to the MT produces a reciprocal recruitment of Mal3 as indicated by lanes 8–15 in Fig. 6B. In the absence of Tea2, the majority of the Mal3 is not bound to the MTs (Fig. 6B, lane 10 versus lane 11), whereas more Mal3 is bound when Tea2 is present (Fig. 6B, lanes 12 versus lane 13). When AMP-PNP induces high binding of Tea2 to the MT, then the binding of Mal3 is even further enhanced with most of the Mal3 bound (Fig. 6B, lane 14 versus lane 15). Lane 12 in Fig. 6A indicates that high amounts of both Tea2 and Mal3 can bind simultaneously to the MT in the presence of AMP-PNP. Tea2 Is a Plus End-directed Motor with Time-dependent Inhibition by Mal3—Axonemes slide along a Tea2 coated surface in 60 mm KCl with a broad distribution of velocities at 0.057 ± 0.015 μm/s for axonemes that are gliding smoothly. To determine the polarity of movement of Tea2, an initial observation was made of the direction of sliding of individual axonemes, and then beads with adsorbed kinesin-1 were introduced into the flow cell. The beads were always observed to move toward the trailing end of the axoneme. Because kinesin-1 is a plus end-directed motor, this indicates that the trailing end of the axoneme in Tea2-dependent sliding is the plus end and that Tea2 is thus also a plus end-directed motor. To determine the influence of Mal3 on movement, a similar procedure was followed in which an initial observation of Tea2-dependent movement was made, and then varying concentrations of Mal3 were introduced into the flow cell. When flushed with 0.25 μm Mal3, the axonemes initially continued moving at a similar rate but gradually slowed down (often with pauses) and then stopped so that no axonemes were still moving after 5–10 min (see the movie in the supplemental material). When flushed with higher concentrations of Mal3, the lag before movement stopped was shortened. A prominent feature of the inhibition by Mal3 was that many of the axonemes that had been gliding smoothly before addition of Mal3 lost attachment to the surface along their length and remained attached only at their trailing plus ends (see the movie in the supplemental material). Of 59 axonemes that were tracked, 7 detached during the addition of Mal3 and were swept away by the flow. The remainder came to a stop with 22 attached to the coverslip surface along their whole length and 30 attached only by their plus ends. When conventional kinesin-1 (DKH960 (26.Stock M.F. Guerrero J. Cobb B. Eggers C.T. Huang T.-G. Li X. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14617-14623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)) was adsorbed to the coverslip instead of Tea2, a much higher Mal3 level of 5 μm had little effect on the sliding velocity in 60 mm KCl (0.59 ± 0.06 μm/s without Mal3 versus 0.56 ± 0.4 μm/s with Mal3). The Tea2 motor constructs have ATPase properties that are similar to those of several other kinesin family members, although the kcat values of ∼15 s–1 at saturating levels of MTs are slower than the value of ∼60 s–1 for conventional kinesin motor domains (25.Jiang W. Stock M. Li X. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and ∼25 s–1 for BimC (6.Stock M.F. Chu J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52315-52322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As also observed for conventional kinesin, Tea2 constructs lacking the C-terminal coiled coils are monomeric, but T2NMC1 with the first coiled coil region is dimeric. The purified protein moves toward the plus end of MTs in an in vitro motility assay, as anticipated from its classification as an N-terminal motor, the mainly plus end-directed movement of Tea2 speckles in vivo (8.Busch K.E. Hayles J. Nurse P. Brunner D. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 831-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and its physiological role. The average sliding velocity of 0.054 μm/s in 60 mm KCl is slower than for conventional kinesin (0.59 μm/s) in agreement with the lower kcat value for Tea2. The relative decrease in sliding velocity for Tea2 is greater than the relative decrease in kcat value, but Tea2 exhibited a broad range of sliding rates, and the observed average in 60 mm KCl may underestimate the true sliding rate for optimal conditions. At subsaturating concentrations of MTs, Mal3 strikingly stimulates the ATPase rate of Tea2 constructs that contain the Nte and weakly stimulates T2M without the Nte (Fig. 3). Because binding to MTs with coupled release of ADP is expected to be the rate-limiting step at low MT concentrations, this stimulation suggest that Mal3 is acting by increasing the binding of Tea2 to the MT. Such recruitment of Tea2 to the MT by Mal3 would not result in a net increase of the ATPase rate if Tea2 was inhibited from rapidly releasing ADP in the ternary complex of MTs with Mal3 and Tea2. The lack of inhibition by high levels of Mal3, however, indicates that this is not a factor and that cyclic ATP hydrolysis by Tea2 is fully active in the ternary complex. Direct binding studies demonstrate that the Nte of Tea2 is sufficient for tight interaction with Mal3 (Fig. 2) and that the interaction of Tea2 with Mal3 results in their mutual recruitment to the MT (Fig. 6). Many kinesins contain an auxiliary MT binding site outside of the motor domain (see Ref. 6.Stock M.F. Chu J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52315-52322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that can increase the net affinity of the motor for the MT. Mal3 also provides an auxiliary MT binding site that increases the affinity of the motor for the MT, but Mal3 provides the auxiliary MT binding site intermolecularly rather than intramolecularly. Interpretation of these results will depend highly on determination of the structure of the ternary complex. For example it is possible that the MT binding domain of Mal3 and the motor domain of Tea2 may bind simultaneously to the same tubulin dimer on a MT or that they may interact with neighboring tubulin binding sites, especially at low levels of binding to the MT. Tea2 must still be able to bind to the MT when high levels of Mal3 are already bound because the maximum ATPase is not inhibited under these circumstances. However, it is also possible that binding of high levels of Tea2 (such as when AMP-PNP is present) displaces Mal3 from the MT so that Mal3 remains tethered to the MT through binding to the Nte of Tea2 but is not directly interacting with the MT. Previous gel filtration studies with a fusion protein of maltose-binding protein and EB1 indicated that it had a large Stokes radius and was possibly tetrameric (27.Rehberg M. Graf R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2301-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Analysis presented here with Mal3 indicates that it is dimeric but does have a larger Stokes radius than expected for a globular dimer because it is highly asymmetric. The dimeric nature of Tea2 and of Mal3 suggests that their interaction may produce a heterotetramer with a Mal3 dimer acting as a cross-link between Tea2 motor domains. Alternatively, the multivalency of these proteins could result in large open networks, especially given the fact that several other proteins are know to interact as well. In particular, Tip1 is also dimeric and binds both to the MT binding domain of Mal3 and to the C-terminal region of Tea2 (as well as binding independently to MTs), and this could lead to extensive cross linking and the formation of the large “dots” at the ends of MTs. The initial binding equilibria between Mal3 and MTs or Tea2 are established rapidly as indicated by the lack of a lag on addition of Mal3 in Fig. 4. Thus the continuation of rapid sliding for many axonemes after addition of 0.25–0.5 μm Mal3 indicates that the initial reversible binding of Mal3 has little effect on the sliding velocity. This is consistent with the lack of inhibition of the ATPase of Tea2 by high levels of Mal3 and by the ability of Mal3 and Tea2 to bind simultaneously to MTs (Fig. 6A, lane 12). The failure of high levels of Mal3 to inhibit sliding of conventional kinesin-1 also indicates that Mal3 does not produce road blocks when bound to the MT. This could be due either to the binding of Mal3 being so rapidly reversible that it is readily displaced by processive kinesin-1 dimers or because binding of Mal3 is not strongly competitive with binding of kinesin motor domains. The observed inhibition of monomeric DKH357 by Mal3 in Fig. 5A under conditions where the rate is limited by MT-stimulated ADP release suggests that the interaction may be at least partially competitive. But even in this case, the inhibition is not pronounced and may still be sufficiently reversible as to not influence the rate-limiting step during processive movement of a dimer of conventional kinesin-1. The slow onset of inhibition of sliding by Mal3 and the preferential attachment of the inhibited axonemes to the surface at their plus ends suggest that these effects are due to some process that is subsequent to initial binding of Mal3 along the length of the axoneme. One possibility is that it is due to a time and concentration dependent accumulation of high local concentrations of Mal3 and possibly Tea2 at the plus end of the axoneme. Further work with fluorescently labeled Mal3 and Tea2 should be informative in this regard. Download .zip (.49 MB) Help with zip files"
https://openalex.org/W1967792679,"Myoglobin (Mb) is used as a model system for other heme proteins and the reactions they catalyze. The latest novel function to be proposed for myoglobin is a P450 type hydroxylation activity of aromatic carbons (Watanabe, Y., and Ueno, T. (2003) Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 76, 1309–1322). Because Mb does not contain a specific substrate binding site for aromatic compounds near the heme, an engineered tryptophan in the heme pocket was used to model P450 hydroxylation of aromatic compounds. The monooxygenation product was not previously isolated because of rapid subsequent oxidation steps (Hara, I., Ueno, T., Ozaki, S., Itoh, S., Lee, K., Ueyama, N., and Watanabe, Y. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 36067–36070). In this work, a Mb variant (F43W/H64D/V68I) is used to characterize the monooxygenated intermediate. A modified (+16 Da) species forms upon the addition of 1 eq of H2O2. This product was digested with chymotrypsin, and the modified peptide fragments were isolated and characterized as 6-hydroxytryptophan using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectroscopy and 1H NMR. This engineered Mb variant represents the first enzyme to preferentially hydroxylate the indole side chain of Trp at the C6 position. Finally, heme extraction was used to demonstrate that both the formation of the 6-hydroxytryptophan intermediate (+16 Da) and subsequent oxidation to form the +30 Da final product are catalyzed by the heme cofactor, most probably via the compound I intermediate. These results provide insight into the mechanism of hydroxylation of aromatic carbons by heme proteins, demonstrating that non-thiolate-ligated heme enzymes can perform this function. This establishes Mb compound I as a model for P450 type aromatic hydroxylation chemistry."

Class B GPCRs are distinguished from the larger group of class A rhodopsin-like receptors in several ways, the most significant of which is the inclusion of an extended amino-terminal domain that plays critical roles in ligand binding and receptor activation (1.Fredriksson R.

Open table in a new tab Like many plasma membrane receptors, newly synthesized class B GPCRs achieve their unique ligand binding and signaling properties only after completing an intricate series of cotranslational folding and processing steps that include addition of oligosaccharides and formation of disulfide bonds. Soon after translation begins, a cleavable signal peptide found at the amino terminus of most B family polypeptides emerges from and then directs the ribosome, via interaction with the signal recognition particle, to the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum for cotranslational translocation and membrane insertion (10.Wallin E. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Within seconds of the nascent polypeptide entering the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, folding intermediates establish the secondary and tertiary structures necessary for the formation of preliminary disulfide bonds and the addition of core N-linked oligosaccharides. Combined with the help of chaperones, disulfide and proline isomerases, and other folding catalysts, these early cotranslational modifications widely are thought to transition the emerging polypeptide through a vectorial progression of conformations that functions to improve the overall efficiency of the folding process (11.Seckler R. Jaenicke R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 12.Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32715-32718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Efficient folding becomes particularly relevant in the cellular context, wherein the biosynthetic folding processes are linked to the maturation of cell signaling molecules and plasma membrane receptors. For example, detailed studies of acetylcholine, insulin, and epidermal growth factor receptors suggest that most mammalian receptors follow a common mechanism in which the endoplasmic reticulum-localized processes of folding, disulfide bond formation/rearrangement, and N-linked glycosylation, but not subunit assembly or Golgi-associated posttranslational processing steps, are prerequisite for acquiring ligand-binding function (13.Olson T.S. Lane M.D. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1618-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Grace et al. (14.Grace C.R.R. Perrin M.H. DiGruccio M.R. Miller C.L. Rivier J.E. Vale W.W. Riek R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In that structure, three disulfide bonds connecting the 1st and 3rd, 2nd and 5th, and 4th and 6th conserved cysteine residues established a protein interaction fold containing two antiparallel β-sheets. It was concluded that because the key structural residues of the fold were conserved among family members, class B receptors likely possess similarly structured amino-terminal domains and thus bind and signal through the same or closely related mechanisms. These very important findings solidified the conclusions of four earlier studies that had deduced the same pattern of disulfide bonds from the sequences and masses of proteolytic fragments derived from corticotropin-releasing factor, glucagon-like peptide 1, and parathyroid hormone receptors (15.Perrin M.H. Fischer W.H. Kunitake K.S. Craig A.G. Koerber S.C. Cervini L.A. Rivier J.E. Groppe J.C. Greenwald J. Nielsen S.M. Vale W.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 96: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Notably, all of these studies, including the NMR study, employed refolded, nonglycosylated amino-terminal fragments that were not associated with either plasma membranes or intact receptor transmembrane domains. The only study that has proposed a disulfide bonding pattern for a biosynthetically folded, fully glycosylated class B GPCR suggested a pattern that disagrees with the consistent pattern deduced from the biochemical and NMR structural studies of refolded receptor fragments described above. In that work, Qi et al. (5.Qi L.J. Leung A.T. Xiong Y. Marx K.A. Abou-Samra A.-B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12442-12448Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) characterized the binding and biological activities of paired cysteine substitution mutants of the intact corticotropin-releasing factor receptor, reasoning that receptor function would better tolerate the removal of certain pairs of cysteines that form disulfide bonds. Aside from providing the advantage of a functional readout of receptor structure, the approach was reasonable considering that the overall conformation of a protein, at least in the case of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, can tolerate the mutational removal of a disulfide bond (19.Liu Y. Breslauer K. Anderson S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5323-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the method had been applied successfully to a class A GPCR, the type IA angiotensin II receptor, to determine which of its extracellular domains were connected by disulfide bonds (20.Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Sano T. Nakagomi Y. Hamakubo T. Morishima I. Inagami T. Regul. Pept. 1995; 57: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Remarkably, corticotropin-releasing factor receptors having paired substitutions of the 1st and 3rd conserved cysteines bound ligand saturably, and constructs with similar mutations of the 2nd and 6th or the 4th and 5th cysteines activated cAMP production to levels comparable with or better than the wild type receptor. These findings led the authors to conclude that the intact receptor possessed disulfide linkages between the 1st and 3rd, 2nd and 6th, and 4th and 5th conserved cysteines. This tenable but different disulfide pattern illuminates the important question of whether the extracellular amino-terminal domain of an intact, fully glycosylated class B receptor possesses the same (or different) disulfide pattern as that determined from the refolded amino-terminal fragments of corticotropin-releasing factor, glucagon-like peptide 1, and parathyroid hormone receptors. We are interested particularly in the structural and ligand-binding properties of the G protein-coupled secretin receptor (SecR), the prototypic member of class B receptors that functions primarily in the secretion of pancreatic and biliary bicarbonate (21.Dong M. Miller L.J. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22.Chey W.Y. Chang T.-M. J. Gastroenterol. 2003; 38: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Like other family members, SecR is stimulated by a relatively large peptide agonist, secretin, whose binding determinants appear to be distributed across the length of the basic 27-amino acid peptide. A detailed understanding of how the receptor binds secretin recently has gained clinical importance upon the discovery of a mis-spliced SecR variant in a pancreatic tumor that in cancer cell lines inhibited wild type receptor function (23.Ding W.-Q.

Miller L.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5223-5229PubMed Google Scholar). Substantial progress has been made in this area, where photoaffinity labeling studies to date have identified eight structural constraints between bound secretin agonist analogues and SecR (25.Dong M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 2894-2903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Nearly all of these ligand-receptor contacts occur at the distal amino terminus of the receptor. The emerging picture is that the high affinity binding determinants at the carboxyl-terminal end of the ligand interact primarily with the distal regions of the receptor extracellular domain, whereas the receptor selectivity determinants at the amino-terminal end of the ligand interact with (and perhaps penetrate) the extracellular loops of the receptor. Although the photoaffinity labeling constraints have provided extremely useful information for modeling the SecR amino-terminal domain, these models have been difficult to prepare without the knowledge of the overall fold that is established by the disulfide linkages within this region. Several important pieces of information have set the stage for the elucidation of the disulfide linkages within the SecR amino terminus. Vilardaga et al. (3.Vilardaga J.-P. Di Paolo E. Bialek C. De Neef P. Waelbroeck M. Bollen A. Robberecht P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) concluded that of the 10 extracellular cysteine residues within rat SecR, the six cysteines Cys24, Cys44, Cys53, Cys67, Cys85, and Cys101 were necessary for receptor function. These amino-terminal residues corresponded to those that are highly conserved within the family (21.Dong M. Miller L.J. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and that have been shown in other receptors to be involved in disulfide bonds (Table I). Recently, we confirmed these findings (4.Asmann Y.W. Dong M. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) by creating a series of receptors having alanine point mutations for each of the conserved cysteines. Despite proper sorting to the plasma membrane, all of the cysteine-mutated receptors were unable to bind secretin or elicit a secretin-stimulated cAMP response. Secretin binding also was diminished after treating cells expressing wild type receptors with cell-impermeant reducing reagents. More importantly, this study also demonstrated directly the presence of three disulfide bonds within the amino-terminal domain, none of which linked this domain to the extracellular loops or membrane-bound body of the receptor. Combined, these data emphasize the importance of extracellular disulfide bonds that exist within the highly folded, structurally independent amino-terminal ligand binding domain of SecR. Here we expand upon our initial efforts in a comprehensive search for paired cysteine mutations that may rescue the loss of function observed previously with single alanine substitutions. This approach was chosen for the following reasons: (a) provides functional readout of the structure of intact, fully processed receptors; (b) allows for direct comparisons to our previous site-directed mutagenesis results, as well as to those of Qi et al. (5.Qi L.J. Leung A.T. Xiong Y. Marx K.A. Abou-Samra A.-B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12442-12448Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) derived from paired cysteine mutants of corticotropin-releasing factor receptors; and (c) offers the potential to resolve conflicting patterns of disulfide bonding among class B GPCRs. Also presented are cyanogen bromide cleavage results that support a disulfide linkage pattern that agrees with the pattern determined from refolded receptor fragments. Cumulatively, our findings provide both the definitive disulfide bonding pattern for the clinically important SecR and a needed link between determinations of patterns of disulfide bonds for class B GPCRs that were folded in the cell or refolded in vitro. Materials—Molecular biology reagents were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), Bio-Rad, and Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Cell culture growth media and antibiotics were obtained from Invitrogen and supplemented (where appropriate) with Fetal Clone II from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Formaldehyde was supplied by Ted Pella (Redding, CA), and primary and fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were supplied by Roche Diagnostics and Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), respectively. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were from Sigma. Chemical cleavage reactions utilized cyanogen bromide (CNBr) purchased from Pierce. All peptides and receptor constructs were based on the sequences of natural rat secretin and secretin receptor. Secretin, [Tyr10]secretin, and photolabile [Tyr10,Bpa26]secretin (Bpa26 probe) were synthesized in our laboratory (32.Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and have been shown to bind and activate (all three peptides) and covalently label (Bpa26 probe only) secretin receptors in intact cells (27.Dong M. Asmann Y.W. Zang M. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26032-26039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Procedures describing the oxidative radioiodination of the Tyr10 residue are published elsewhere (32.Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest quality appropriate for the given experiment. Receptor Mutagenesis—The disulfide pattern of the rat secretin receptor was examined by systematically mutating to serine each of the six conserved cysteine residues within the extracellular domain. These mutations generated a complete series of SecR mutants having either single or paired C24S, C44S, C53S, C67S, C85S, and/or C101S changes (numbering starts with the 1st amino acid residue after the signal sequence). Additional SecR mutants were prepared for CNBr cleavage experiments to strategically test the presence of specific disulfide bonds. These included constructs having M73I as well as this mutation along with both A41M and L99M. All receptor mutations were integrated into the coding sequence of a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged version of SecR that was placed downstream of the constitutive cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) (25.Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Single-codon mutations were introduced into this pcDNA3.1/HA37-SecR template in whole-plasmid PCRs using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and appropriate sets of complementary forward and reverse mutagenic primers. Multiple codon exchanges were introduced into HA37-SecR coding sequences possessing an appropriate single mutation either through successive rounds of QuikChange mutagenesis or through excision and subsequent ligation of restriction fragments that utilized a vector-derived KpnI site and/or naturally occurring BspEI or EcoNI sites within the receptor open reading frame. Mutated coding sequences were confirmed by automated dye-terminator cycle sequencing. Cell Cultures and Transfections—Two different cell types obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were employed. African green monkey kidney (COS) cells propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% (v/v) Fetal Clone II were maintained in a humidified chamber with 5% (v/v) CO2 at 37 °C. Syrian baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were maintained under the same conditions, except that the culture medium consisted of equal parts DMEM and Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture. Both cultures were passaged twice per week on tissue culture flasks (Corning Glass). The various cysteine mutants of SecR were expressed transiently in COS cells using a modified DEAE-dextran transfection method described previously (33.Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14394-14398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Roughly 500,000 cells adhered to a 10-cm Petri dish were treated for 1–2 h with a serum-free DMEM mixture containing 0.2 mg/ml DEAE-dextran and 3 μg of plasmid DNA (1.5 ml total volume). The cells then were shocked for exactly 2 min in 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) in serum-free culture medium prior to another 1–2-h incubation in 0.1 mm chloroquine in serum-free DMEM. Transfected cells were washed and cultured for 24 h in DMEM with serum before lifting with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin and inoculating plates for subsequent analyses. Three BHK cell lines stably expressing HA37-SecR, HA37-M73I-SecR, or HA37-A41M/M73I/L99M-SecR were created for CNBr cleavage experiments. Briefly, ∼500,000 cells adhered to a 10-cm Petri dish were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated for 15 min in a buffered CaCl2 (125 mm) solution (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 0.75 mm Na2HPO4, 70 mm NaCl) containing 20 μg of plasmid DNA (1 ml total volume). The cells then were cultured for 24 h in serum-containing DMEM/F-12 medium before lifting with trypsin and transferring to flasks for selection. Transfected, receptor-bearing cells selected as G418-resistant colonies were enriched through a single round of clonal selection by limiting dilution. The resulting clonal cultures were screened for secretin binding, and those clones exhibiting attributes most like wild type receptors were characterized fully for secretin ligand binding and receptor activation. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Transiently transfected COS cells seeded on 25-mm round coverslips in 6-well plates were prepared for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy ∼72 h post-transfection, according to established procedures (34.Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 105.3-105.4Google Scholar). Specifically, cells were fixed in fresh 2% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min immediately after removal from the growth incubator and without washing. After two 10-min washes in PBS, nonspecific binding sites were blocked during two additional 10-min washes in PBS containing 1% (v/v) normal goat serum. Cell surface antigens were immunolabeled without permeabilization by inverting coverslips onto drops of primary (mouse anti-HA epitope, clone 12CA5, 1:500) and secondary (Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse, 1:500) antibodies diluted in PBS with normal goat serum for 1–2 h in a humidified chamber. The cells were washed with three 10-min exchanges of PBS with normal goat serum and four 10-min exchanges of PBS between antibody incubations and after application of secondary antibodies, respectively, before mounting on microscope slides in 40% (v/v) glycerol. All steps were performed at room temperature. Labeled cells were observed and photographed with a Zeiss (Thornwood, NY) LSM 510 confocal microscope. Micrographs were adjusted for contrast and assembled into figures using Adobe Photoshop (Mountain View, CA). Membrane Preparations—Plasma membranes from BHK cell cultures were prepared for receptor binding analyses and photoaffinity labeling experiments according to well described methods used routinely for receptor-bearing Chinese hamster ovary cell cultures (35.Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. H"
https://openalex.org/W1982288232,"Compartmentation of carbohydrate metabolism has been shown in a wide range of tissues including reports of one compartment of glycolysis associated with the plasma membrane of cells. However, only in the erythrocyte has the physical basis for plasma membrane-associated glycolytic pathway been established. We have previously found that phosphofructokinase (PFK) appeared to colocalize with the fairly ubiquitous plasma membrane protein caveolin-1 (CAV-1), consistent with a role for CAV-1 as an anchor for glycolysis to the plasma membrane. To test the hypothesis that CAV-1 functions as a scaffolding protein for PFK, we transfected human lymphocytes (a cell without CAV-1 expression) with human CAV-1 cDNA. We demonstrate that expression of CAV-1 in lymphocytes results in the formation of caveolae at the plasma membrane and affects the subcellular localization of PFK by recruiting PFK to the plasma membrane. Targeting of PFK by CAV-1 also was validated by the significant colocalization between the proteins after transfection, which resulted in a correlation of 0.97 +/- 0.004 between the two fluorophores. This finding is significant in as much as it illustrates the CAV-1 feasibility of generating binding sites for glycolytic enzymes on the plasma membrane. We therefore conclude that CAV-1 functions as a scaffolding protein for PFK and that this may contribute to the elucidation of the basis for carbohydrate compartmentation to the plasma membrane in a wide variety of cell types."

For this reason, Cdk activities are tightly controlled by several mechanisms: cyclin binding, activating phosphorylation by the Cdk-activating kinase (CAK), inhibitory phosphorylation by Wee1/Myt1 kinases, dephosphorylation by the dual specificity phosphatase Cdc25, transcriptional regulation, ubiquitin-mediated degradation, subcellular localization, binding of inhibitors. Eleven different Cdks have been identified in mammals. Of these, Cdk4 and Cdk6 bind to the three D-type cyclins and are active in the G1 phase. Cdk2 binds to E- and A-type cyclins and has been thought to promote entry into S-phase and DNA replication. Cdc2 binds to the A- and B-type cyclins and is responsible for entry into mitosis. In general, the activities of Cdk4 and Cdk6 are hard to differentiate although there are indications that they do not have identical functions. For example, Cdk4 knock-out mice display specific defects (1Tsutsui T. Hesabi B. Moons D.S. Pandolfi P.P. Hansel K.S. Koff A. Kiyokawa H. Mol. Cell.

Cyclin binding to the Cdk catalytic subunit is an important step in the activation of Cdks since it leads to a realignment of the activation segment/T-loop (substrate binding region) and the P-loop (ATP binding site) (3Jeffrey P.D.

For example, cyclin A binds to the PSTAIR helix, the T-loop, and the C-terminal lobe of Cdk2. For full activation of Cdks, threonine 177 in Cdk6 (Thr-160 in Cdk2) needs to be phosphorylated by CAK (for review see Ref. 4Kaldis P. Cell. Mol.

Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) whereas the Ink4 inhibitors bind exclusively to the N-terminal lobe of Cdk4 or Cdk6 (29Russo A.A. Tong L.

Interestingly, immunoprecipitation of p16 from cell extracts did not yield a heterotrimeric complex (Cdk4/6, cyclin D, and p16) but only a p16·Cdk4 complex (24Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3339) Google Scholar) suggesting that p16 would dissociate Cdk4/6 and cyclin D. Nevertheless, ectopic expression of p15 resulted in a heterotrimeric complex of Cdk4, cyclin D, and p15 (31Reynisdóttir I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of Cdk·cyclin complexes is an important determinant of their function and is an area we know very little about. It has been shown that the cyclin subunits can influence substrate specificity since binding of different cyclins to the same Cdk can change its substrate specificity (32Peeper D.S. Parker L.L.

Furthermore, there is a substrate binding site in the cyclin subunits, termed Cy or RXL motif (35Chen J. Saha P. Kornbluth S. Dynlacht B.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell.

Mutation of the Cy/RXL motif leads to decreased phosphorylation of Rb without affecting other substrates (e.g. histone H1) (37Schulman B.A. Lindstrom D.L. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2002; 9: 177-181PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that the interaction between the KSHV-cyclin and Cdk6 is limited to the PSTAIR helix, whereas cyclin A binds to the PSTAIR helix, the T-loop, and the C-terminal lobe of Cdk2 (3Jeffrey P.D.

Here I investigate how the KSHV-cyclin activates Cdk6 using a series of KSHV-cyclin mutants. Several point mutations in the KSHV-cyclin lead to increased kinase activity in vitro and in cells and this is associated with decreased binding capacity between Cdk6 and the KSHV-cyclin. Interestingly, deletion of the N terminus of KSHV-cyclin leads to decreased phosphorylation of histone H1 whereas other substrates are not affected. To study the complex formation of p16, Cdk6, and KSHV-cyclin, p16 was expressed at high levels in U2OS cells, and a heterotrimeric complex of p16·Cdk6·KSHV-cyclin was detected. Nevertheless, p16 was not bound to KSHV-cyclin mutants because of the weak interaction with Cdk6 in cells. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—Wild-type GST-Cdk6 (pGEX-KG; PKB512, Ref. 49Kaldis P. Ojala P.M.

They protrude toward the central pair microtubule complex with which they have transient but regular interactions for the normal flagellar motility to occur. Flagella of Chlamydomonas mutants deficient in entire radial spokes or spoke heads are paralyzed. In this study the importance of two radial spoke proteins in the flagellar movement is exemplified by the potent inhibitory action of two monoclonal antibodies on the axonemal motility of demembranated-reactivated Chlamydomonas models. We show that one of these proteins is localized on the stalk of the radial spokes, whereas the other is a component of the head of the same structure and most likely correspond to radial spoke protein 2 and 1, respectively. Fine motility analysis by videomicrography further indicates that these two anti-radial spoke protein antibodies at low concentration affect motility of demembranated-reactivated Chlamydomonas by changing the flagellar waveform without modifying axonemal beat frequency. They also modify wave amplitude differently during motility inhibition. This brings more direct evidence for the involvement of both radial spoke stalk and head in the fine tuning of the waveform during flagellar motility.

They also modify wave amplitude differently during motility inhibition. This brings more direct evidence for the involvement of both radial spoke stalk and head in the fine tuning of the waveform during flagellar motility. Eukaryotic flagella and cilia share a common structure called the axoneme that is responsible for their motility. The main difference between flagellar and ciliary motility resides in that the former is predominantly symmetric (such as that of spermatozoa), and the latter is asymmetric (such as that of tracheal or Tetrahymena cilia). However, depending on environmental conditions, the same axonemal structure is amenable to both types of motility as is the case for the biflagellated green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This unicellular microorganism has adopted a ciliary type of motility with its breaststroke forward swimming but can also briefly move backward with a flagellar type of motility in response to signals such as a photo-shock (1Witman G.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 403-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).The axoneme is composed of nine outer doublet and two central singlet microtubules running its whole length (2Satir P. Fawcett D.W. Bedford J.M. The Spermatozoon. Urban and Schwarzenberg Inc., Baltimore1979: 81-90Google Scholar). Each doublet microtubule comprises tubules A and B. Whereas the B tubule is poorly decorated, the A tubule is well garnished with outer and inner dynein arms, nexin links, the dynein regulatory complex and radial spokes, the latter protruding toward the central pair microtubules (3Mitchell D.R. J. Phycol. 2000; 36: 261-273Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Numerous short projections are tightly associated with the central pair tubules, and they are altogether referred to as the central pair complex (3Mitchell D.R. J. Phycol. 2000; 36: 261-273Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar).At the ultrastructural level, both flagellar and ciliary movements result from the active sliding of the nine doublet microtubules through the cross-bridging of outer and inner dynein arms from one doublet microtubule to the B tubule of the adjacent doublet microtubule (4Gibbons I.R. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 107-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 5Gibbons I.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In Chlamydomonas, outer dynein arms are not essential for the normal form of the propagating wave but determine the maximum velocity of outer doublet microtubule sliding, whereas inner arms provide the additional force necessary to maintain a high velocity in the presence of load and regulate beating symmetry (6Brokaw C.J. Kamiya R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1987; 8: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 7Kamiya R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In Chlamydomonas axonemes, every time a bending wave propagates, the central pair complex rotates one turn, thus creating transient interactions with the heads of the radial spokes (8Omoto C.K. Yagi T. Kurimoto E. Kamiya R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 33: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As linkers between the outer microtubules and the central pair complex, radial spokes appear to be the major load carrier of the transverse force created at bending points by the pulling and/or pushing dynein arms. Radial spokes must contribute through their transient interactions with the central pair complex to the proper alternation from one side of the axoneme to the other of the tensions generated by dynein arm cross-bridging (9Lindemann C.B. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 4115-4126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10Smith E.F. Yang P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 57: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Chlamydomonas mutants lacking the entire radial spokes or spoke heads are immotile (11Witman G.B. Plummer. J. Sander G. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 76: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 12Huang B. Piperno G. Ramanis Z. Luck D.J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and provide evidence that these structures are important components in maintaining proper axonemal motility.Further insight into the radial spoke function has been provided by studies on suppressor mutations restoring motility in radial spoke mutants without restoration of these structures (13Huang B. Ramanis Z. Luck D.J.L. Cell. 1982; 28: 115-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 14Brokaw C.J. Luck D.J.L. Huang B.H. J.

Their results suggested that radial spokes are not essential for bending to occur but, rather, contribute in the modulation of the microtubule doublets, sliding to give rise to the asymmetric flagellar movement typical of wild-type Chlamydomonas. On the other hand, asymmetric motility can also be restored in these same mutants under various conditions; this is, external mechanical stimulation, low ATP concentrations (20–50 μm), the simultaneous presence of ATP and ADP or analogs, or even the presence of some organic compounds (8Omoto C.K. Yagi T. Kurimoto E. Kamiya R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 33: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16Hayashibe K. Shingyoji C. Kamiya R. Cell Motil.

Moreover, the presence of radial spokes is required for the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of the 138-kDa intermediate chain of inner dynein arm subunit f (19Smith E.F. Sale W.S. Science. 1992; 257: 1557-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 20Habermacher G. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). All these findings suggest a role for the radial spokes in the regulation of flagellar movement likely via a complex signal transduction system (21Porter M.E.P. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 22Yang P. Sale W.S. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 13: 3303-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), but the precise function of radial spoke is still unclear.The radial spoke of Chlamydomonas flagella comprises 23 polypeptides (designated radial spoke protein 1–23 (RSP1–23) 1The abbreviations used are: RSP, radial spoke protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody (Ab); pI, isoelectric point; HDE, Hepes, dithiothreitol, and EDTA; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TBS-T, TBS with Triton X-100.1The abbreviations used are: RSP, radial spoke protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody (Ab); pI, isoelectric point; HDE, Hepes, dithiothreitol, and EDTA; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TBS-T, TBS with Triton X-100.), 18 for the stem and 5 for the head (25Yang P.

Diener D.R. Rosenbaum J.L. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and their specific interactions with each other or with other axonemal proteins and their role in motility remain poorly understood.Although studies on immotile mutants lacking radial spokes and especially on the reversal of flagellar paralysis by extragenic suppressor mutations provided good insights in the functional role for these axonemal structures, they have serious limitations. First, these mutations are pleiotropic (30Piperno G. Huang B. Luck D.J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1600-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 31Piperno G. Huang B. Ramanis Z. Luck D.J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Second, some suppressor mutants in a wild-type background also have aberrant motility, in particular, a low flagellar beat frequency (15Brokaw C.J. Luck D.J.L. Cell Motil. 1985; 5: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because of these drawbacks inherent to mutation studies, we chose in the present work to use monoclonal antibodies (mAb) selected from a panel of mAb generated against Chlamydomonas axonemal proteins on the basis of their strong motility inhibition of demembranated-reactivated Chlamydomonas wild-type cells. This approach with mAb has previously proved to be useful in the study of the role of specific proteins in sea urchin sperm motility (32Gagnon C. White D. Huitorel P. Cosson J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33Cosson J. White D. Huitorel P. Eddé B. Cibert C. Audebert S. Gagnon C. Cell Motil.

Cell. 1998; 9: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For example, D316 mAb, specifically reacting toward a radial spoke head protein of sea urchin axoneme, changes flagellar beating from a two-dimensional to a three-dimensional type of movement (36Gingras D. White D. Garin J. Cosson J. Huitorel P. Zingg H. Cibert C. Gagnon C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Two of the mAb generated, L2H12 and L3G4, were used in the present study to evaluate functional properties of radial spoke components in Chlamydomonas motility. We first ascertained that antigens recognized by L2H12 and L3G4 are localized on radial spokes and then determined toward which specific RSP they are directed. These mAb were then used to further analyze their effects on various motility parameters by videomicrography to assess the mechanism by which these two RSP are involved in the regulation of flagellar motility.MATERIALS AND METHODSProduction of Monoclonal Antibodies—The hybridoma lines secreting L2H12 and L3G4 mAbs were obtained following procedures already described (32Gagnon C. White D. Huitorel P. Cosson J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 37Galfrè G. Milstein C. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 73: 3-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar) using purified wild-type Chlamydomonas axonemes as immunogens. The two criteria for mAb selection were single band detection on immunoblots made with purified wild-type Chlamydomonas axonemes and inhibition of the motility of demembranated-reactivated Chlamydomonas cells.To get crude preparations of the mAbs, large pools of supernatants from hybridoma cells cultured in a serum-free protein-free medium (Sigma, catalog number S-2772) were collected, concentrated by ultrafiltration with an Amicon YM100 filter (100-kDa exclusion limit, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (20 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.001% sodium azide. Further purification of the mAbs was achieved by Protein A immunoaffinity using the Econo-Pac kit from Bio-Rad (catalog number 732–2020) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Chlamydomonas Cell Culture—The following C. reinhardtii strains, all obtained from the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center (Department of Botany, Duke University, Durham, NC), were used in this study: wild-type cc1010, uniflagellar mutant uni1 cc1926, radial spoke mutants pf1 cc1024, pf14 cc1032, pf17 cc1035, pf24 cc1384, pf25 cc1385, pf26 cc1386, and pf27 cc1387, outer dynein arm mutants oda1 cc2228 and oda9 cc2244, inner dynein arm f mutant ida2 cc2666, inner dynein arm a, c, and d mutant ida4 cc2670, inner dynein arm e and dynein regulatory complex mutant pf3 cc1026, and the mutant pf15 cc1033 lacking central pair microtubules.Chlamydomonas cells were cultured on a modified medium 1 of Sager and Granick (38Sager R. Granick S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1953; 56: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar); the total phosphate concentration was increased from 1.31 to 16.7 mm, and 14.7 mm of sodium acetate was added. The final pH of that medium was 6.8. Cells were grown with gentle air bubbling at 25 °C on a 14/10-h light/dark cycle. In these conditions Chlamydomonas cells were well synchronized in their division with a doubling rate around 12 h.Preparation and Fractionation of Axonemes—Five to ten liters of Chlamydomonas cultures grown to 5 × 106 cells/ml were used to prepare axonemes for fractionation. Cells were gently concentrated down to 100 ml using a tangential flow filtration device equipped with a 0.6-μm Durapore membrane cassette (Millipore Corp.). Then axonemes were obtained following a procedure previously described (39Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and finally resuspended at a protein concentration of 5–10 mg/ml for immediate use or storage at –70 °C in the presence of 20% glycerol and protease inhibitors (leupeptin 10 μg/ml, aprotinin 10 μg/ml, and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).Radial spokes were extracted using the procedure published by Yang et al. (25Yang P. Diener D.R. Rosenbaum T.E. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1315-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Dynein arms are first removed from the isolated axonemes by two consecutive treatments with 0.6 m NaCl, and the radial spokes then extracted by a 0.5 m potassium iodide (KI) treatment. The other sequential fractionation of axonemes was achieved as follows. Axonemes, adjusted to 5 mg of protein/ml, were first extracted at 4 °C by a 10-min high salt treatment (0.6 m NaCl in 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA (HDE), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to solubilize the dynein arms, then subjected to a low salt treatment in HDE buffer, partially extracting the radial spoke heads (31Piperno G. Huang B. Ramanis Z. Luck D.J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) with a 16-h dialysis against the same buffer, and last, extracted with 0.2% Sarkosyl plus 2 m urea in HDE for 10 min to remove the remaining radial spokes. In both cases the remaining undissolved axonemal material was resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer for analysis as well.Immunofluorescence on Isolated Axonemes—Smears of purified axonemes at 10–20 μg of protein/ml in 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), were prepared on positively charged slides (Fisherbrand Superfrost/Plus, catalog number 12-550-15, Fisher) that were immersed in 100% methanol at –20 °C for 10 min and then rehydrated in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.8)-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBS-T). This was followed by a blocking step performed at 21 °C for 1 h with 5% goat serum in TBS-T. Smears were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (Ab) diluted from crude preparations (3–5 mg protein/ml) as follows: DM1A 1/1000, L2H12 1/20, and L3G4 1/50 in TBS-T plus 1% goat serum. The next morning slides were washed 3 times for 5 min each by soaking them into TBS-T. The secondary Ab (biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG, 3/1000 in TBS-T plus 1% goat serum) (Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd., Ontario, Canada) was added then for a 1-h incubation at 21 °C. Slides were then washed as above before the addition of the Alexa Fluor 555 streptavidin conjugate (1/500 w/v) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for a 45-min additional incubation at 21 °C in the dark. After washing in TBS-T, slides were finally mounted with Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes) and observed under a Carl Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) Axiophot microscope (exciter filter BP 450–490) at 1000× magnification. To assess the background fluorescence, negative controls were performed using the Alexa Fluor 555 streptavidin conjugate alone or the secondary Ab plus the Alexa Fluor 555 conjugate. Fluorescence images were captured with a monochrome Retiga 1300 cooled-CCD camera (QImaging, Canada) and digitized on a computer using the Northern Eclipse Version 6.0 program.Demembranation-Reactivation Assay of Chlamydomonas Models and Motility Analysis—Fifty to one hundred ml of actively growing Chlamydomonas cultures at 1–2 × 106 cells/ml were gently spun at 200 × g for 4 min at 20 °C, washed twice with 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and finally, resuspended into 200 μl of the same buffer. This concentrated stock suspension of highly motile cells was then diluted 5-fold into a demembranation solution (30 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgSO4,1mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm potassium acetate (HMDEK), supplemented with 0.5% polyethyleneglycol 20,000, 1% Ficoll and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Motility was re-initiated by diluting 20-fold into the reactivation buffer (HMDEK plus 2% polyethylene glycol and 1 mm ATP). This motility assay was performed in a 96-well microtiter plate at a final volume of 100 μl using the wild-type cells. Percentages of motility were estimated by eye with an inverted microscope at 200× magnification. Controls were done in the absence of mAb or in the presence of mAb L1F1, a mAb reacting against a single epitope on Chlamydomonas axonemal immunoblot and of a similar isotype (IgG1) as L2H12 and L3G4 but with no significant effect on the motility of demembranated-reactivated Chlamydomonas cells at similar concentration.To facilitate detailed flagellar movement analysis, uniflagellated mutant cells were used for videomicrography recordings (S-VHS format, Panasonic WWF camera and recorder). Upon demembranation reactivation into a microtube, a 20-μl drop of the uni cell mixture was immediately transferred onto a clean slide and covered with a coverslip that was sealed with vacuum grease onto the slide for observation and recording for 30 to 45 min. Successive images were taken to cover a complete cycle of movement of the flagellum by use of dark field microscopy with a 40× lens and oil immersion condenser (Olympus Co. for both) combined with hand translation of the microscope stage illuminated at high strobe frequency (Chadwick-Helmut, La Jolla, CA). Detailed images were captured using a 100× oil immersion phase contrast lens (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Digitization of images was achieved using a digitizor (Formac Studio, GmbH) connected to a McIntosh computer (iMac, Apple Corp., Cupertino, CA). The rotation of the cell body that occurs during motility of uniflagellar mutants was corrected for by rotating the images so that the images could be superimposed on each other, with the anchoring point of the flagellum into the cell body serving as the reference point. The overlapping flagellar images allowed the clear visualization of a beating envelope, which is defined as the plane area covered by the flagellum during a complete beat cycle. iMovie Software (Apple Corp., Cupertino, CA) was used to grab the individual image frames and the Photoshop 7 program (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA) to trace the flagellum at successive positions and delineate flagellar beating envelopes. The surfaces of those envelopes were calculated through a modified version of the NIH Image program (40Brokaw C.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 17: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The width of this beating envelope, or wave amplitude, was also measured at three different positions, proximal, median, and distal, located at ⅓, ⅔, and 33, respectively, of the distance from the flagellar origin. Beat frequencies were determined on demembranated-reactivated uniflagellar mutant cells as well using a Chadwick-Helmut stroboscope model 236 coupled to a Zeiss microscope, whereas they were observed with an oil immersion 100× objective under phase contrast.Protein Determination and Immunoblotting—Determination of protein concentration was done according to the method of Bradford (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard for the total axonemes and extracts or purified bovine immunoglobulins when measuring concentrations of mAb preparations.SDS-PAGE and electroblotting were conducted following the procedures of Laemmli (42Laemmli V.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) and Towbin et al. (43Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44708) Google Scholar), respectively. All immunodetections were performed with crude preparations of L2H12 and L3G4 mAb at 10 and 1 μg/ml, respectively, using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate (LumiLight, Roche Diagnostics) following the instructions from the manufacturer. Immunoreactivity of L2H12 and L3G4 mAb toward RSP23 was tested in parallel with the control anti-RSP23 rabbit CT220 Ab (150 dilution of a RSP23 blot-purified preparation) on the same blot using an immunoblotting apparatus (Immunetics, Boston, MA) (Fig. 2B). Both RSP23 fusion protein and CT220 Ab were obtained from Dr. S. King (University of Connecticut Health Center) (26Patel-King R.S. Gorbatyuk O. Takebe S. King S.M. Mol. Biol.

The L1F1 mAb was of the same isotype as L2H12 and L3G4 and did not cause any significant motility inhibition even at concentrations 30–50-fold higher than those of mAb L2H12 and L3G4 (Fig. 1). A similar observation has also been reported in previous studies where mAb generated against sea urchin axonemal proteins but directed to proteins other than RSP1 and RSP2 were tested on sea urchin sperm motility (32Gagnon C.

When L2H12 or L3G4 mAb was added into the assay mixture, the time needed to inhibit the motility and bring the percentage of motile cells to 10% or below varied according to the concentration and mAb used (Fig. 1). This level of inhibition was reached faster in the presence of L2H12, being almost immediate at 0.1 μg/ml and taking 10–15 min at 0.01 μg/ml, whereas in the presence of L3G4 at similar concentrations, 30 and 60 min, respectively, were needed to attain the same level of inhibition. At 0.001 μg/ml, the percentage of moving cells dropped gradually within 2 h, very similarly for both mAb.Fig. 1L2H12 and L3G4 mAb dose-dependently inhibit the motility of demembranated-reactivatedChlamydomonas. Demembranation-reactivation assays were performed on wild-type Chlamydomonas cells, as described under “Materials and Methods,” in the absence of mAb or in the presence of mAb L1F1 (⋄, ♦) or in the presence of 0.1 (ο), 0.01 (▵) and 0.001 (□) μg/ml of purified L2H12 or in the presence of 0.1 (•), 0.01 (▴), and 0.001 (▪) μg/ml purified L3G4. Values are the averages of data obtained from at least five experiments performed with different Chlamydomonas preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Localization of L2H12 and L3G4 Antigens—To localize the L2H12 and L3G4 antigens on the Chlamydomonas flagellar axoneme, immunoblotting analysis was performed using purified axonemes from wild-type and various flagellar mutants of Chlamydomonas. In the first series of experiments, flagella from mutants missing outer dynein arms (oda1 and oda9), inner dynein arms f (ida2), inner dynein arms a, c, and d (ida4), inner dynein arms e and dynein regulatory complex (pf3), radial spokes (pf14), or central pair microtubules (pf15) were tested with the L2H12 or L3G4 mAb. Both antibodies reacted with a single protein band at 105 kDa for L2H12 and at 110 kDa for L3G4 in all mutants except pf14 (data not shown), indicating the localization of the antigens recognized by these mAb on radial spokes.In the second set of experiments seven different radial spoke mutants including pf14 were used (Fig. 2A). L2H12 antigen was present in all mutants tested except for pf14, which totally lacks radial spokes, and pf24, which expresses only a small amount of RSP2 (31Piperno G. Huang B. Ramanis Z. Luck D.J.L.

Cell. 2004; 3: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that the latter may be the target for the L2H12 mAb. Moreover, positive reactions with the L2H12 antibody were observed on pf1 and pf17 axonemes (Fig. 2A), which both specifically lack the spoke heads (30Piperno G. Huang B. Luck D.J.L. Proc. Natl.
