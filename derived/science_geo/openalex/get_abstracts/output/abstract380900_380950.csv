(p. 52 , published online 20 May; see the cover; see the Policy Forum by Cho and Relman ) have brought together technologies from the past 15 years to start from digital information on the genome of Mycoplasma mycoides to chemically synthesize the genomic DNA as segments that could then be assembled in yeast and transplanted into the cytoplasm of another organism. A number of methods were also incorporated to facilitate testing and error correction of the synthetic genome segments. The transplanted genome became established in the recipient cell, replacing the recipient genome, which was lost from the cell. The reconstituted cells were able to replicate and form colonies, providing a proof-of-principle for future developments in synthetic biology."

https://openalex.org/W2163290657,"Background Altering the normal association between touch and its visual correlate can result in the illusory perception of a fake limb as part of our own body. Thus, when touch is seen to be applied to a rubber hand while felt synchronously on the corresponding hidden real hand, an illusion of ownership of the rubber hand usually occurs. The illusion has also been demonstrated using visuomotor correlation between the movements of the hidden real hand and the seen fake hand. This type of paradigm has been used with respect to the whole body generating out-of-the-body and body substitution illusions. However, such studies have only ever manipulated a single factor and although they used a form of virtual reality have not exploited the power of immersive virtual reality (IVR) to produce radical transformations in body ownership. Principal Findings Here we show that a first person perspective of a life-sized virtual human female body that appears to substitute the male subjects' own bodies was sufficient to generate a body transfer illusion. This was demonstrated subjectively by questionnaire and physiologically through heart-rate deceleration in response to a threat to the virtual body. This finding is in contrast to earlier experimental studies that assume visuotactile synchrony to be the critical contributory factor in ownership illusions. Our finding was possible because IVR allowed us to use a novel experimental design for this type of problem with three independent binary factors: (i) perspective position (first or third), (ii) synchronous or asynchronous mirror reflections and (iii) synchrony or asynchrony between felt and seen touch. Conclusions The results support the notion that bottom-up perceptual mechanisms can temporarily override top down knowledge resulting in a radical illusion of transfer of body ownership. The research also illustrates immersive virtual reality as a powerful tool in the study of body representation and experience, since it supports experimental manipulations that would otherwise be infeasible, with the technology being mature enough to represent human bodies and their motion."

The self-assembly of traditional small-molecule and polymeric amphiphiles has led to the production of micelles, liposomes, polymeric micelles, and polymersomes for use in drug delivery applications. Now, Percec et al. (p. 1009 ) describe the self-assembly of Janus-type (i.e., two-headed) dendrimers to produce monodisperse supramolecular constructs, termed “dendrimersomes,” and other complex architectures. The structures, which showed long-term stability as well as very narrow size distributions, were easily produced by the injection of an ethanolic solution of the dendrimer into water. The dendrimersomes could be loaded with the anticancer drug doxorubicin and exhibited controlled drug release with changing pH."

To better understand the full spectrum of cellular control mechanisms mediated by phosphorylation, Breitkreutz et al.

The results reveal a network of interacting protein kinases and phosphatases, and analysis of other interacting proteins suggests previously undiscovered roles for many of these enzymes."

Now, Yvan-Charvet et al. (p. 1689 , published online 20 May; see the Perspective by Hansson and Björkholm ) show that the adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 are critical suppressors of atherosclerosis-associated leukocytosis. Mice deficient in both transporters in blood-producing hematopoietic cells possessed increased levels of hematopoietic stem and multipotential progenitor cells and accelerated atherosclerosis. ABCA1 and ABGA1 protect against atherosclerosis by promoting cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-laden macrophage foam cells to lipid-poor high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and apolipoprotein A-1. The leukocytosis and atherosclerosis in ABCA1- and ABG1-deficient mice were reversed in the presence of high amounts of HDL. Thus, signaling already known to inhibit atherosclerosis by reducing cholesterol in atherosclerotic plaques also reduces atherosclerosis-associated leukocytosis."

By measuring the spectral function of charge carriers in quasi-freestanding graphene with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we showed that at finite doping, this well-known linear Dirac spectrum does not provide a full description of the charge-carrying excitations. We observed composite ""plasmaron"" particles, which are bound states of charge carriers with plasmons, the density oscillations of the graphene electron gas. The Dirac crossing point is resolved into three crossings: the first between pure charge bands, the second between pure plasmaron bands, and the third a ring-shaped crossing between charge and plasmaron bands."

https://openalex.org/W1979181404,"Cell surface receptors convert extracellular cues into receptor activation, thereby triggering intracellular signaling networks and controlling cellular decisions. A major unresolved issue is the identification of receptor properties that critically determine processing of ligand-encoded information. We show by mathematical modeling of quantitative data and experimental validation that rapid ligand depletion and replenishment of the cell surface receptor are characteristic features of the erythropoietin (Epo) receptor (EpoR). The amount of Epo-EpoR complexes and EpoR activation integrated over time corresponds linearly to ligand input; this process is carried out over a broad range of ligand concentrations. This relation depends solely on EpoR turnover independent of ligand binding, which suggests an essential role of large intracellular receptor pools. These receptor properties enable the system to cope with basal and acute demand in the hematopoietic system."
https://openalex.org/W2166572326,"Background The notion that AP-2 clathrin adaptor is an essential component of an endocytic clathrin coat appears to conflict with recent observations that substantial AP-2 depletion, using RNA interference with synthesis of AP-2 subunits, fails to block uptake of certain ligands known to internalize through a clathrin-based pathway. Methodology/Principal Findings We report here the use of in vivo imaging data obtained by spinning-disk confocal microscopy to study the formation of clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membranes of BSC1 and HeLa cells depleted by RNAi of the clathrin adaptor, AP-2. Very few clathrin coats continue to assemble after AP-2 knockdown. Moreover, there is a total absence of clathrin-containing structures completely lacking AP-2 while all the remaining coats still contain a small amount of AP-2. These observations suggest that AP-2 is essential for endocytic coated-pit and coated-vesicle formation. We also find that AP-2 knockdown strongly inhibits light-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated endocytosis, as long as cells are maintained in complete serum and at 37°C. If cells are first incubated with LDL at 4°C, followed by warming, there is little or no decrease in LDL uptake with respect to control cells. LDL uptake at 37°C is also not affected in AP-2 depleted cells first deprived of LDL by incubation with either serum-starved or LDL-starved cells for 24 hr. The LDL-deprived cells display a significant increase in endocytic structures enriched on deeply invaginated tubes that contain LDL and we suggest that under this condition of stress, LDL might enter through this alternative pathway. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that AP-2 is essential for endocytic clathrin coated-pit and coated-vesicle formation. They also indicate that under normal conditions, functional endocytic clathrin coated pits are required for LDL internalization. We also show that under certain conditions of stress, cells can upregulate alternative endocytic structures with the potential to provide compensatory trafficking pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2058699555,"Background Substantial resources and patient commitment are required to successfully scale-up antiretroviral therapy (ART) and provide appropriate HIV management in resource-limited settings. We used pharmacy refill records to evaluate risk factors for loss to follow-up (LTFU) and non-adherence to ART in a large treatment cohort in Nigeria. Methods and Findings We reviewed clinic records of adult patients initiating ART between March 2005 and July 2006 at five health facilities. Patients were classified as LTFU if they did not return >60 days from their expected visit. Pharmacy refill rates were calculated and used to assess non-adherence. We identified risk factors associated with LTFU and non-adherence using Cox and Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) regressions, respectively. Of 5,760 patients initiating ART, 26% were LTFU. Female gender (p<0.001), post-secondary education (p = 0.03), and initiating treatment with zidovudine-containing (p = 0.004) or tenofovir-containing (p = 0.05) regimens were associated with decreased risk of LTFU, while patients with only primary education (p = 0.02) and those with baseline CD4 counts (cell/ml3) >350 and <100 were at a higher risk of LTFU compared to patients with baseline CD4 counts of 100–200. The adjusted GEE analysis showed that patients aged <35 years (p = 0.005), who traveled for >2 hours to the clinic (p = 0.03), had total ART duration of >6 months (p<0.001), and CD4 counts >200 at ART initiation were at a higher risk of non-adherence. Patients who disclosed their HIV status to spouse/family (p = 0.01) and were treated with tenofovir-containing regimens (p≤0.001) were more likely to be adherent. Conclusions These findings formed the basis for implementing multiple pre-treatment visit preparation that promote disclosure and active community outreaching to support retention and adherence. Expansion of treatment access points of care to communities to diminish travel time may have a positive impact on adherence."
https://openalex.org/W1963854758,"Background Bystander affiliation (post-conflict affiliation from an uninvolved bystander to the conflict victim) may represent an expression of empathy in which the bystander consoles the victim to alleviate the victim's distress (“consolation”). However, alternative hypotheses for the function of bystander affiliation also exist. Determining whether ravens spontaneously offer consolation to distressed partners may not only help us to understand how animals deal with the costs of aggressive conflict, but may also play an important role in the empathy debate. Methodology/Principal findings This study investigates the post-conflict behavior of ravens, applying the predictive framework for the function of bystander affiliation for the first time in a non-ape species. We found weak evidence for reconciliation (post-conflict affiliation between former opponents), but strong evidence for both bystander affiliation and solicited bystander affiliation (post-conflict affiliation from the victim to a bystander). Bystanders involved in both interactions were likely to share a valuable relationship with the victim. Bystander affiliation offered to the victim was more likely to occur after intense conflicts. Renewed aggression was less likely to occur after the victim solicited affiliation from a bystander. Conclusions/Significance Our findings suggest that in ravens, bystanders may console victims with whom they share a valuable relationship, thus alleviating the victims' post-conflict distress. Conversely victims may affiliate with bystanders after a conflict in order to reduce the likelihood of renewed aggression. These results stress the importance of relationship quality in determining the occurrence and function of post-conflict interactions, and show that ravens may be sensitive to the emotions of others."
https://openalex.org/W2073914850,"Background It is still unclear which observational learning mechanisms underlie the transmission of difficult problem-solving skills in chimpanzees. In particular, two different mechanisms have been proposed: imitation and emulation. Previous studies have largely failed to control for social factors when these mechanisms were targeted. Methods In an attempt to resolve the existing discrepancies, we adopted the ‘floating peanut task’, in which subjects need to spit water into a tube until it is sufficiently full for floating peanuts to be grasped. In a previous study only a few chimpanzees were able to invent the necessary solution (and they either did so in their first trials or never). Here we compared success levels in baseline tests with two experimental conditions that followed: 1) A full model condition to test whether social demonstrations would be effective, and 2) A social emulation control condition, in which a human experimenter poured water from a bottle into the tube, to test whether results information alone (present in both experimental conditions) would also induce successes. Crucially, we controlled for social factors in both experimental conditions. Both types of demonstrations significantly increased successful spitting, with no differences between demonstration types. We also found that younger subjects were more likely to succeed than older ones. Our analysis showed that mere order effects could not explain our results. Conclusion The full demonstration condition (which potentially offers additional information to observers, in the form of actions), induced no more successes than the emulation condition. Hence, emulation learning could explain the success in both conditions. This finding has broad implications for the interpretation of chimpanzee traditions, for which emulation learning may perhaps suffice."

Myocardin is perhaps the most potent transcription factor for stimulating expression of smooth muscle-specific genes; little is known, however, about whether myocardin can orchestrate ECM expression to act in concert with smooth muscle differentiation program. In this study, we demonstrated myocardin coordinate smooth muscle differentiation by inducing transcription of microRNA-143 (miR-143), which attenuates ECM versican protein expression. Previous studies have shown that versican is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan of the ECM that is produced by synthetic SMCs and promotes SMC migration and proliferation. Our data demonstrated that myocardin significantly represses versican expression in multiple cell lines, and this occurs through the induction of miR-143 by myocardin. By a modified reverse transcribed PCR, we found that miR-143 specifically binds to the 3′-untranslated region of versican mRNA. Reporter assays validated that miR-143 targets versican 3′-untranslated region through an evolutionarily conserved miR-143 binding site. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-143 significantly represses versican expression, whereas conversely, depletion of endogenous miR-143 results in up-regulation of versican expression. In addition, we demonstrated that myocardin represses versican through induction of miR-143. Finally, we found that the regulation of versican by miR-143 is involved in platelet-derived growth factor BB-induced SMC migration.

https://openalex.org/W2125898157,"Analysis of the genome sequences of the major human bacterial pathogens has provided a large amount of information concerning their metabolic potential. However, our knowledge of the actual metabolic pathways and metabolite fluxes occurring in these pathogens under infection conditions is still limited. In this study, we analysed the intracellular carbon metabolism of enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC HN280 and EIEC 4608-58) and Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium (Stm 14028) replicating in epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2). To this aim, we supplied [U-13C6]glucose to Caco-2 cells infected with the bacterial strains or mutants thereof impaired in the uptake of glucose, mannose and/or glucose 6-phosphate. The 13C-isotopologue patterns of protein-derived amino acids from the bacteria and the host cells were then determined by mass spectrometry. The data showed that EIEC HN280 growing in the cytosol of the host cells, as well as Stm 14028 replicating in the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) utilised glucose, but not glucose 6-phosphate, other phosphorylated carbohydrates, gluconate or fatty acids as major carbon substrates. EIEC 4608-58 used C3-compound(s) in addition to glucose as carbon source. The labelling patterns reflected strain-dependent carbon flux via glycolysis and/or the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway, the TCA cycle and anapleurotic reactions between PEP and oxaloacetate. Mutants of all three strains impaired in the uptake of glucose switched to C3-substrate(s) accompanied by an increased uptake of amino acids (and possibly also other anabolic monomers) from the host cell. Surprisingly, the metabolism of the host cells, as judged by the efficiency of 13C-incorporation into host cell amino acids, was not significantly affected by the infection with either of these intracellular pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1998995999,"The pathogen Bacillus anthracis uses the Sortase A (SrtA) enzyme to anchor proteins to its cell wall envelope during vegetative growth. To gain insight into the mechanism of protein attachment to the cell wall in B. anthracis we investigated the structure, backbone dynamics, and function of SrtA. The NMR structure of SrtA has been determined with a backbone coordinate precision of 0.40 +/- 0.07 A. SrtA possesses several novel features not previously observed in sortase enzymes including the presence of a structurally ordered amino terminus positioned within the active site and in contact with catalytically essential histidine residue (His(126)). We propose that this appendage, in combination with a unique flexible active site loop, mediates the recognition of lipid II, the second substrate to which proteins are attached during the anchoring reaction. pK(a) measurements indicate that His(126) is uncharged at physiological pH compatible with the enzyme operating through a ""reverse protonation"" mechanism. Interestingly, NMR relaxation measurements and the results of a model building study suggest that SrtA recognizes the LPXTG sorting signal through a lock-in-key mechanism in contrast to the prototypical SrtA enzyme from Staphylococcus aureus."
https://openalex.org/W2165284335,"In the murine cerebral cortex, mammalian homologues of the Cux family transcription factors, Cux1 and Cux2, have been identified as restricted molecular markers for the upper layer (II-IV) pyramidal neurons. However, their functions in cortical development are largely unknown. Here we report that increasing the intracellular level of Cux1, but not Cux2, reduced the dendritic complexity of cultured cortical pyramidal neurons. Consistently, reducing the expression of Cux1 promoted the dendritic arborization in these pyramidal neurons. This effect required the existence of the DNA-binding domains, hence the transcriptional passive repression activity of Cux1. Analysis of downstream signals suggested that Cux1 regulates dendrite development primarily through suppressing the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1, and RhoA may mediate the regulation of dendritic complexity by Cux1 and p27. Thus, Cux1 functions as a negative regulator of dendritic complexity for cortical pyramidal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1995358487,"Flp-In(TM) T-REx(TM) 293 cells expressing a wild type human M(3) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor construct constitutively and able to express a receptor activated solely by synthetic ligand (RASSL) form of this receptor on demand maintained response to the muscarinic agonist carbachol but developed response to clozapine N-oxide only upon induction of the RASSL. The two constructs co-localized at the plasma membrane and generated strong ratiometric fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals consistent with direct physical interactions. Increasing levels of induction of the FRET donor RASSL did not alter wild type receptor FRET-acceptor levels substantially. However, ratiometric FRET was modulated in a bell-shaped fashion with maximal levels of the donor resulting in decreased FRET. Carbachol, but not the antagonist atropine, significantly reduced the FRET signal. Cell surface homogeneous time-resolved FRET, based on SNAP-tag technology and employing wild type and RASSL forms of the human M(3) receptor expressed stably in Flp-In(TM) TREx(TM) 293 cells, also identified cell surface dimeric/oligomeric complexes. Now, however, signals were enhanced by appropriate selective agonists. At the wild type receptor, large increases in FRET signal to carbachol and acetylcholine were concentration-dependent with EC(50) values consistent with the relative affinities of the two ligands. These studies confirm the capacity of the human M(3) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor to exist as dimeric/oligomeric complexes at the surface of cells and demonstrate that the organization of such complexes can be modified by ligand binding. However, conclusions as to the effect of ligands on such complexes may depend on the approach used."

Knowledge of the diversity of HRV populations emerging during the course of a natural infection is essential and represents a basis for the design of future potential vaccines and antiviral drugs. To evaluate HRV evolution in humans, nasal wash samples were collected daily for five days from 15 immunocompetent volunteers experimentally infected with a reference stock of HRV-39. In parallel, HeLa-OH cells were inoculated to compare HRV evolution in vitro. Nasal wash in vivo assessed by real-time PCR showed a viral load that peaked at 48-72 h. Ultra-deep sequencing was used to compare the low-frequency mutation populations present in the HRV-39 inoculum in two human subjects and one HeLa-OH supernatant collected 5 days post-infection. The analysis revealed hypervariable mutation locations in VP2, VP3, VP1, 2C and 3C genes and conserved regions in VP4, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B and 3D genes. These results were confirmed by classical sequencing of additional samples, both from inoculated volunteers and independent cell infections, and suggest that HRV inter-host transmission is not associated with a strong bottleneck effect. A specific analysis of the VP1 capsid gene of 15 human cases confirmed the high mutation incidence in this capsid region, but not in the antiviral drug-binding pocket. We could also estimate a mutation frequency in vivo of 3.4x10(-4) mutations/nucleotides and 3.1x10(-4) over the entire ORF and VP1 gene, respectively. In vivo, HRV generate new variants rapidly during the course of an acute infection due to mutations that accumulate in hot spot regions located at the capsid level, as well as in 2C and 3C genes."

https://openalex.org/W1984156308,"Background Regulation of α-synuclein levels within cells is thought to play a critical role in Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathogenesis and in other related synucleinopathies. These processes have been studied primarily in reduced preparations, including cell culture. We now develop methods to measure α-synuclein levels in the living mammalian brain to study in vivo protein mobility, turnover and degradation with subcellular specificity. Methodology/Principal Findings We have developed a system using enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-tagged human α-synuclein (Syn-GFP) transgenic mice and in vivo multiphoton imaging to measure α-synuclein levels with subcellular resolution. This new experimental paradigm allows individual Syn-GFP-expressing neurons and presynaptic terminals to be imaged in the living mouse brain over a period of months. We find that Syn-GFP is stably expressed by neurons and presynaptic terminals over this time frame and further find that different presynaptic terminals can express widely differing levels of Syn-GFP. Using the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) technique in vivo we provide evidence that at least two pools of Syn-GFP exist in terminals with lower levels of mobility than measured previously. These results demonstrate that multiphoton imaging in Syn-GFP mice is an excellent new strategy for exploring the biology of α-synuclein and related mechanisms of neurodegeneration.

https://openalex.org/W2140373765,"Sperm protein (Sp17) is an attractive target for ovarian cancer (OC) vaccines because of its over-expression in primary as well as in metastatic lesions, at all stages of the disease. Our studies suggest that a Sp17-based vaccine can induce an enduring defense against OC development in C57BL/6 mice with ID8 cells, following prophylactic and therapeutic treatments. This is the first time that a mouse counterpart of a cancer testis antigen (Sp17) was shown to be expressed in an OC mouse model, and that vaccination against this antigen significantly controlled tumor growth. Our study shows that the CpG-adjuvated Sp17 vaccine overcomes the issue of immunologic tolerance, the major barrier to the development of effective immunotherapy for OC. Furthermore, this study provides a better understanding of OC biology by showing that Th-17 cells activation and contemporary immunosuppressive T-reg cells inhibition is required for vaccine efficacy. Taken together, these results indicate that prophylactic and therapeutic vaccinations can induce long-standing protection against OC and delay tumor growth, suggesting that this strategy may provide additional treatments of human OC and the prevention of disease onset in women with a family history of OC."

https://openalex.org/W2094565495,"LKB1 is a tumor suppressor protein whose loss leads to HIF1alpha-mediated activation of a proangiogenic program in intestinal polyps. LKB1 is also protein kinase regulator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, which is essential for endothelial cell responses to tissue ischemia. To discern whether LKB1 signaling is either pro- or antiangiogenic, we investigated ischemia-induced revascularization in mice that were deficient for LKB1 in Tie2-Cre-expressing cells. Whereas homozygous deletion of LKB1 led to embryonic lethality, heterozygous LKB1-knock-out (KO) (Lkb1(flox/+);Tie2(Tg/+)) mice were viable. Unchallenged heterozygous LKB1-KO mice displayed normal capillary density, but the revascularization of hind limb following ischemic surgery was significantly impaired as evaluated by laser Doppler flow and capillary density measurements. Reduction of LKB1 in cultured endothelial cells, using either small interfering RNA or an adenovirus expressing nonfunctional kinase-dead LKB1 protein, attenuated endothelial proliferation, migration, and differentiation into network structures on Matrigel that was accompanied by diminished AMPK phosphorylation at Thr-172. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated LKB1 overexpression (Ad-LKB1) augmented network structure formation, and this was associated with elevated AMPK phosphorylation. The augmented differentiation of endothelial cells into network structures induced by Ad-LKB1 was abrogated by the co-transduction of a dominant negative mutant of AMPK. These observations suggest that the LKB1-AMPK signaling axis in endothelial cells is a positive regulator of the revascularization response to tissue ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W1965197048,"DNA cytosine methylation is an epigenetic mark that promotes gene silencing and performs critical roles during reproduction and development in both plants and animals. The genomic distribution of DNA methylation is the dynamic outcome of opposing methylation and demethylation processes. In plants, active demethylation occurs through a base excision repair pathway initiated by 5-methycytosine (5-meC) DNA glycosylases of the REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1)/DEMETER (DME) family. To gain insight into the mechanism by which Arabidopsis ROS1 recognizes and excises 5-meC, we have identified those protein regions that are required for efficient DNA binding and catalysis. We have found that a short N-terminal lysine-rich domain conserved in members of the ROS1/DME family mediates strong methylation-independent binding of ROS1 to DNA and is required for efficient activity on 5-meC·G, but not for T·G processing. Removal of this domain does not significantly affect 5-meC excision from short molecules, but strongly decreases ROS1 activity on long DNA substrates. This region is not required for product binding and is not involved in the distributive behavior of the enzyme on substrates containing multiple 5-meC residues. Altogether, our results suggest that methylation-independent DNA binding allows ROS1 to perform a highly redundant search for efficient excision of a nondamaged, correctly paired base such as 5-meC in long stretches of DNA. These findings may have implications for understanding the evolution of structure and target specificity in DNA glycosylases.

In addition to ROS1 and DME, the genome of Arabidopsis encodes two additional paralogs with 5-meC DNA glycosylase activity, referred to as DEMETER-LIKE proteins DML2 and DML3 (14.Penterman J.

The in vivo functions of plant 5-meC DNA glycosylases are not fully understood, but they seem to contribute to the stability and flexibility of the plant epigenome.

ROS1, DML2, and DML3 may protect the genome from excess methylation, counteracting hypermethylation at hundreds of discrete regions across the plant genome (14.Penterman J. Zilberman D. Huh J.H.

Biol. 2007; 17: 54-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It is unclear how these 5-meC DNA glycosylases are targeted to specific genomic regions, but there is evidence indicating that demethylation by ROS1 may be guided by small RNAs bound to ROS3 (20.Zheng X. Pontes O. Zhu J. Miki D. Zhang F. Li W.X. Iida K. Kapoor A. Pikaard C.S. Zhu J.K. Nature. 2008; 455: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A notable feature of all DNA repair glycosylases is their ability to single out damaged and/or mismatched bases among a vast excess of nontarget bases. However, 5-meC DNA glycosylases perform the most remarkable task of excising a nondamaged, correctly paired base. It remains unknown how the enzymes of the ROS1/DME family specifically recognize 5-meC in DNA. In addition to 5-meC, ROS1 and DME also excise with less efficiency its deamination product thymine (5-methyluracil) from T·G mispairs, but do not show detectable activity on either C·G pairs or U·G mispairs (11.Morales-Ruiz T. Ortega-Galisteo A.P. Ponferrada-Marín M.I. Martínez-Macías M.I. Ariza R.R. Roldán-Arjona T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 6853-6858Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that ROS1 activity is facilitated at mismatched 5-meC residues, but strongly inhibited by replacement of the C5 methyl group by halogen derivatives, even if these substituents decrease the strength of the scissile C1′-N-glycosidic bond (21.Ponferrada-Marín M.I. Roldán-Arjona T. Ariza R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4264-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ROS1 specificity arises by a combination of selective steric recognition of the methyl group at the active site and the intrinsic stability and dynamics of the target base pair. We have undertaken the task of identifying critical regions necessary for ROS1 activity and specificity. In this report, we show that a lysine-rich N-terminal domain conserved across the ROS1/DME family allows ROS1 to bind DNA in a methylation-independent manner, selectively favors 5-meC over T excision, and significantly facilitates initiation of DNA demethylation in long DNA substrates. We propose that the nonspecific binding afforded by this region provides ROS1 with the capacity to scan DNA redundantly in the search for a nondamaged, correctly paired target base. Oligonucleotides used as DNA substrates (supplemental Table S1) were synthesized by Operon and purified by PAGE before use. Double-stranded DNA substrates were prepared by mixing a 5 μm solution of a 5′-fluorescein-labeled or 5′-Alexa Fluor-labeled oligonucleotide (upper strand) with a 10 μm solution of an unlabeled oligomer (lower strand), heating to 95 °C for 5 min, and slowly cooling to room temperature. Annealing reactions for the preparation of the one-nucleotide gapped duplex were carried out at 95 °C for 5 min in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of both unlabeled 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotide (P30_51) and unlabeled oligonucleotide (CGR) with respect to the 5′-Alexa Fluor-labeled 3′-phosphorylated oligonucleotide (Al-28P), followed by cooling to room temperature. ROS1 deletion constructs were generated by performing PCR on ROS1 cDNA with specific primers (supplemental Table S2) and cloning the resulting products into pET30b (Novagen), except for ΔN294-ROS1, which was obtained by subcloning an EcoRI–HindIII fragment into pET28c (Novagen). Expression of full-length ROS1 and its deletion derivatives was carried out in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) dcm− Codon Plus cells (Stratagene). A fresh single transformant colony was inoculated into 10 ml of LB medium containing kanamycin (30 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml), and the culture was incubated at 37 °C overnight with shaking. A 2.5-ml aliquot of the overnight culture was inoculated into 250 ml of LB medium containing kanamycin (30 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C, 250 rpm, until the A600 was 0.1. The culture was then placed at 15 °C, and incubation continued at 250 rpm until the A600 reached 0.7. Expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm and incubating for 2 h. After induction, cells were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min and the pellet frozen at −80 °C. The stored pellet was thawed and resuspended in 3.5 ml of sonication buffer (SB) (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 5 mm imidazole. Cells were disrupted by sonication, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated with SB supplemented with 5 mm imidazole. The column was washed with 10 ml of SB supplemented with 5 mm imidazole, followed by 10 ml of SB supplemented with 100 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted with a 30-ml gradient of imidazole (100 mm to 1 m) in SB and collected in 0.5-ml fractions. An aliquot of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing a single band of the overexpressed protein were pooled and dialyzed against dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol). The protein preparation was divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. All steps were carried out at 4 °C or on ice. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay. Denatured proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) using broad range molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad). Standard bandshift reactions were performed using fluorescein- and/or Alexa Fluor-labeled duplex oligonucleotides. In standard gel-retardation reactions, increasing amounts of protein were incubated with 100 nm labeled oligonucleotide substrate in the presence of unlabeled pBluescript (60 ng) as competing nucleic acid. Competition bandshift reactions were performed by including increasing amounts of unlabeled duplex as competitor DNA. Binding reactions were carried out at 25 °C for 60 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA in a final volume of 10 μl. Complexes were electrophoresed through 0.2% agarose gels in 1 × TAE (40 nm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA) buffer. Electrophoresis was carried out in 1 × TAE for 40 min at 80 V at room temperature. Fluorescein- or Alexa Fluor-labeled DNA was visualized in a FLA-5100 imager and analyzed using Multigauge software (Fujifilm). In EMSAs with increasing concentrations of ROS1 or its derivatives, the dissociation constants were determined by plotting the concentration of protein·DNA complex (B) versus protein concentration and fitting the data toB=Bmax⋅PKd+P(Eq. 1) where Kd is the dissociation constant, P is protein concentration and Bmax is the maximum concentration of the protein·DNA complex. In competition EMSAs, dissociation constants were determined as described in Ref. 22.Tan T. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3247-3254Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, by plotting the concentration of the protein·DNA complex (B) versus the concentration of cold competitor DNA and fitting the data toB=Bmax(D∗+Kd∗)D∗+Kd∗+D⋅Kd∗Kd(Eq. 2) where Kd* and Kd are the dissociation constants for the labeled probe and unlabeled competitor DNA, respectively, D* and D are the concentration of labeled probe and competitor DNA, respectively, and Bmax is the maximum concentration of the protein·DNA complex. When the labeled probe and competitor DNA are identical, Kd* = Kd, and Equation 1 simplifies toB=Bmax(D∗+Kd∗)D∗+Kd∗+D(Eq. 3) Kd* values for labeled probes were determined from the fit to Equation 3 and then used in Equation 2 to derive Kd values for the unlabeled competitors. Double-stranded oligonucleotides (20 nm, unless otherwise stated) were incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the indicated amounts of full-length ROS1 or its deletion derivatives in a total volume of 50 μl. Reactions were stopped by adding 20 mm EDTA, 0.6% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, and the mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. DNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and ethanol precipitated at −20 °C in the presence of 0.3 mm NaCl and 16 μg/ml glycogen. Samples were resuspended in 10 μl of 90% formamide and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Reaction products were separated in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. Fluorescein-labeled DNA was visualized in a FLA-5100 imager and analyzed using Multigauge software. We used the EMSA to compare the capability of ROS1 to bind methylated and unmethylated DNA (Fig. 1). We found that ROS1 formed a complex with a 51-bp double-stranded DNA probe that contained a single bimethylated CG site, but also bound with similar efficiency to an equivalent unmethylated probe (Fig. 1A). Analogous results were obtained when comparing ROS1 binding to a 50-bp probe containing four bimethylated CG sites and its unmethylated counterpart (Fig. 1A). We also compared ROS1 binding with unmethylated DNA duplexes containing either 3 CG sites or no CG sites at all and found that the absence of CG dinucleotide sequences does not affect binding (supplemental Fig. S2). We next examined in detail the binding affinity of ROS1 through competition experiments with unlabeled oligonucleotides. ROS1 binding to a methylated DNA probe was reduced with equivalent intensity when incubated with increasing amounts of either nonmethylated or methylated unlabeled competitor DNA (Fig. 1B). The relative affinity of ROS1 for nonmethylated and methylated competitor DNA was similar, with dissociation constants (Kd) of 39.7 nm and 34.5 nm, respectively. Comparable results were observed when a nonmethylated DNA was used as a probe (Fig. 1B), with estimated Kd values of 36.6 nm and 34.6 nm for the unmethylated and methylated unlabeled competitor, respectively. We therefore conclude that ROS1 displays a strong DNA binding capacity that is independent of the methylation state of DNA. We next asked whether the nonspecific DNA binding capacity of ROS1 could be assigned to a particular region of the protein sequence. ROS1 and its homologs are large polypeptides containing a DNA glycosylase domain with significant sequence similarity to base excision DNA repair proteins in the HhH-GPD superfamily (23.Nash H.M. Bruner S.D. Schärer O.D. Kawate T. Addona T.A. Spooner E. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 968-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition to the DNA glycosylase domain, the proteins of the ROS1/DME family share two other conserved domains of unknown function and unique to this class of proteins (11.Morales-Ruiz T. Ortega-Galisteo A.P. Ponferrada-Marín M.I. Martínez-Macías M.I. Ariza R.R. Roldán-Arjona T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 6853-6858Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). An additional conserved feature is a short amino-terminal domain significantly rich in lysine (supplemental Fig. S1 and Table S3). We generated a series of N- and C-terminal ROS1 deletion mutants, and the purified proteins were used in EMSAs to analyze their capacity to bind a methylated DNA probe (Fig. 2). Deletion of the N-terminal 294 amino acids of ROS1 yielded a protein (NΔ294) with a strongly reduced DNA binding capacity (Kd = 7.3 μm) compared with the full-length protein (Kd = 34.3 nm). The further loss of 225 amino acids from the N terminus (NΔ519) slightly increased this diminished binding activity (Kd = 1.3 μm) (Fig. 2). A truncated protein (NΔ519CΔ313) that additionally lacked the C-terminal 313 amino acids but still conserved the DNA glycosylase domain, did not exhibit any detectable DNA binding capacity. The C-terminal 313 amino acids fragment (NΔ1080) was able by itself to bind the DNA probe, but with very low affinity (Kd = 2.6 μm). Finally, a small fragment of 230 amino acids (NΔ88CΔ1075) that contained the N-terminal lysine-rich region (positions 112–260) displayed a strong DNA binding capacity (Kd = 17.9 nm), even higher than that of the full-length protein. Competition experiments with unmethylated and methylated competitor DNA confirmed that the DNA binding activity of this N-terminal region was independent of the methylation state of DNA (supplemental Fig. S3). Altogether, these results indicate that the methylation-independent DNA binding activity of ROS1 largely resides in a basic, lysine-rich, N-terminal region of the protein. We next analyzed the enzymatic activity of the different ROS1 deletion mutants by performing DNA glycosylase assays on a 51-mer duplex oligonucleotide substrate that contained a single 5-meC·G pair (Fig. 3). Removal of the N-terminal 294 amino acids significantly reduced the 5-meC DNA glycosylase activity of ROS1, yielding a mutant protein that processed about half the amount of product than the full-length (FL) protein after 4-h and 24-h incubation time. Further elimination of 225 amino acids from the N terminus almost entirely abolished the enzymatic activity of the protein, despite preservation of those residues corresponding to the DNA glycosylase domain and the highly conserved C-terminal region. Polypeptides with further deletions did not show any detectable enzymatic activity (Fig. 3). The strongly reduced DNA glycosylase activity of NΔ294 compared with the full-length protein suggested that the nonspecific DNA binding capacity afforded by the N-terminal region of ROS1 might be important for substrate recognition and specificity. We therefore performed a kinetic analysis to examine the relative activities of FL- and NΔ294-ROS1 toward a 51-mer duplex oligonucleotide substrate that contained either 5-meC or T opposite G at position 29 in a CG context (Fig. 4 and supplemental Table S4). A simple Michaelis-Menten model is inadequate for a correct kinetic analysis of ROS1 because this protein does not exhibit significant turnover in vitro due to strong product binding (21.Ponferrada-Marín M.I. Roldán-Arjona T. Ariza R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4264-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have used a previously described method (24.Hardeland U. Bentele M. Jiricny J. Schär P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33449-33456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) successfully employed to measure and compare single-turnover kinetics with different orthologs of thymine DNA glycosylase (25.Hardeland U. Bentele M. Jiricny J. Schär P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2261-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For each enzyme and substrate, we determined the parameters Pmax (maximum substrate processing within an unlimited period of time); T50 (the time required to reach 50% of the product plateau level, Pmax), and the relative processing efficiency (Erel = Pmax/T50). Consistent with our previously reported observations (11.Morales-Ruiz T. Ortega-Galisteo A.P. Ponferrada-Marín M.I. Martínez-Macías M.I. Ariza R.R. Roldán-Arjona T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 6853-6858Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 21.Ponferrada-Marín M.I. Roldán-Arjona T. Ariza R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4264-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) we found that FL-ROS1 processed 5-meC with higher relative processing efficiency than T (Fig. 4 and supplemental Table S4). In contrast, NΔ294-ROS1 excised both 5-meC and T with similar processing efficiencies (Fig. 4 and supplemental Table S4). We therefore conclude that removal of the N terminus abrogates ROS1 preference for 5-meC over T. The results described above suggested that nonspecific DNA binding mediated by the N terminus of ROS1 might facilitate 5-meC recognition on DNA. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the relative abilities of FL- and NΔ294-ROS1 to excise a single 5-meC residue from a centrally located CG site in various DNA duplexes of equivalent DNA sequences but different lengths (Fig. 5A). We found that a 12-bp DNA was a poor substrate for both FL- and NΔ294-ROS1, but increasing substrate length up to 20 bp gradually enhanced the efficiency of 5-meC excision by both proteins. Interestingly, however, FL- and NΔ294-ROS1 exhibited a markedly different pattern of activity on longer DNA substrates. Whereas the full-length protein displayed a significant level of activity on DNA substrates up to 52 bp long, the efficiency of 5-meC excision by NΔ294-ROS1 on DNA duplexes longer than 20 bp was significantly reduced. To confirm this difference further, we performed time course experiments comparing the relative capacities of FL- and NΔ294-ROS1 to excise 5-meC either from a “short” (20-bp) or a “long” (52-bp) DNA substrate (Fig. 5B). We found that, although both proteins exhibited a similar level of activity on the 20-bp substrate, the efficiency of 5-meC excision by NΔ294-ROS1 from the 52-bp DNA duplex was significantly lower than that of FL-ROS1 (Fig. 5B). We therefore conclude that the N terminus of ROS1 facilitates 5-meC excision from long DNA substrates. We next tested whether the positive effect of the N terminus on ROS1 activity on long DNA substrates might be alternatively explained by a higher catalytic turnover due to facilitated product release. Because ROS1 is a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase that cleaves the phosphodiester backbone at the 5-meC removal site by successive β,δ-elimination, its final reaction product is a single-nucleotide gap flanked by 3′-P and 5′-P ends (11.Morales-Ruiz T. Ortega-Galisteo A.P. Ponferrada-Marín M.I. Martínez-Macías M.I. Ariza R.R. Roldán-Arjona T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 6853-6858Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to investigate whether ROS1 binds to the further N terminus of the protein may influence such binding. We performed EMSA analysis to compare the ability of FL-ROS1 and NΔ294-ROS1 to bind either a 51-bp duplex oligonucleotide with a C·G pair at position 29, or an analogous probe with a single-nucleotide gap flanked by 3′-P and 5′-P ends (Fig. 6). We found that both proteins bound with higher affinity the duplex oligonucleotide bearing the nucleotide gap than the homoduplex DNA (Fig. 6A). To compare the relative affinities of FL-ROS1 and NΔ294-ROS1 for the single-nucleotide gap, we carried out EMSA competition analysis with a gapped DNA probe in the presence of increasing amounts of either unlabeled competitor homoduplex or gapped DNA (Fig. 6B). For both FL-ROS1 and NΔ294-ROS1, competition was significantly more effective with the unlabeled gapped duplex. Thus, the affinity of FL-ROS1 for the gapped DNA (Kd = 17.6 nm) was about 2-fold higher than for the homoduplex (Kd = 38.2 nm). A similar relative increase in affinity for the gapped substrate (Kd = 2.3 μm) compared with the homoduplex DNA (Kd = 7.1 μm) was observed for the truncated protein (Fig. 6B). Altogether, these results indicate that both FL-ROS1 and NΔ294-ROS1 bind specifically to the single-nucleotide gap left after 5-meC excision and strand incision. We therefore conclude that the N terminus of ROS1 is not required for product binding. We have previously reported that ROS1 does not exhibit significant processivity in vitro (21.Ponferrada-Marín M.I. Roldán-Arjona T. Ariza R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4264-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The above results suggested that a major factor explaining the lack of processivity of ROS1 is the strong binding of the enzyme to its reaction product, the single-nucleotide gap. We reasoned that if the N terminus of the enzyme is not involved in such product binding, then the distributive behavior of ROS1 should not be significantly affected by the loss of the N-terminal domain. To test this prediction we examined whether the distributive behavior of ROS1 is altered in the truncated NΔ294-ROS1 protein. We incubated either FL-ROS1 or NΔ294-ROS1 with a double-stranded oligonucleotide substrate containing three 5-meC residues in the upper strand separated by nine nucleotides and located in the same sequence context (Fig. 7) (see supplemental Table S1). Whereas a processive mechanism will rapidly produce a completely processed substrate represented by a 16-nucleotide labeled fragment, a distributive mechanism will lead to the additional accumulation of partially processed reaction intermediates represented by 26- and 36-nucleotide labeled fragments (21.Ponferrada-Marín M.I. Roldán-Arjona T. Ariza R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4264-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previously reported observations, we found that FL-ROS1 processed 5-meC in a highly distributive fashion, exhibiting a steady accumulation of the 16-nucleotide fragment but also of significant amounts of partially processed substrates, even after long incubation times (Fig. 7B). As expected, at equimolar concentration NΔ294-ROS1 displayed a lower activity than the full-length enzyme, but generated a very similar accumulation pattern of completely and partially processed substrates (Fig. 7B). Analogous results were obtained when the analysis was performed with lower concentrations of both enzymes (supplemental Fig. S4). We therefore conclude that the N terminus of ROS1 mediates nonspecific binding to DNA but does not influence the distributive behavior of the enzyme, which is rather caused by strong binding of the catalytic domain to the reaction product. The potential of ROS1 and its homologs to remove a modified, but otherwise nondamaged, correctly paired base is rather exceptional among DNA glycosylases. In an effort to understand how 5-meC DNA glycosylases recognize and excise their target, we have identified ROS1 regions required for DNA binding and catalysis. We have found that a lysine-rich domain at the N terminus of ROS1 endows the enzyme with the capacity to bind DNA strongly in a methylation-independent manner and greatly facilitates 5-meC excision from long DNA substrates. Similar lysine-rich regions are present at the N-terminal extension of distant members of the ROS1/DME family of 5-meC DNA glycosylases (supplemental Fig. S1 and supplemental Table S3), which suggests an evolutionarily conserved important function. Previous studies have reported that noncatalytic N-terminal extensions of DNA glycosylases may regulate their enzymatic activity, usually through modulation of product dissociation rates (26.Liu X. Roy R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27.Adhikari S. Uren A. Roy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30078-30084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the N termini of mouse and human endonuclease III homolog facilitate (27.Adhikari S. Uren A. Roy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30078-30084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and reduce (26.Liu X. Roy R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) product dissociation rates, respectively. We have found, however, that the N-terminal extension of ROS1 is not required for the strong product binding capacity exhibited by this protein. In agreement with this observation, both the N-terminally truncated version and the full-length enzyme display a similar distributive behavior when acting on a DNA substrate containing multiple 5-meC targets. It might seem rather unexpected that the nonspecific DNA binding afforded by the N terminus does not endow FL-ROS1 with higher processivity than NΔ294-ROS1. However, it should be kept in mind that nonspecific DNA binding merely increases the probability that the enzyme remains bound to the DNA after one step of random walk, thus effectively increasing the protein capacity to slide or scan the molecule (28.Zharkov D.O. Grollman A.P. Mutat. Res. 2005; 577: 24-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This capacity does not necessarily increase processivity, which specifically refers to the probability of the enzyme resuming the walk after a catalytic cycle is complete (28.Zharkov D.O. Grollman A.P. Mutat. Res. 2005; 577: 24-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Processivity is strongly dependent on the rate of product release. Therefore, a DNA glycosylase may be able to efficiently slide DNA in search for a target base, but nevertheless lack processivity because it remains strongly bound to the abasic site generated after base excision. Altogether, our results suggest that the N terminus of ROS1 facilitates target location through nonspecific DNA binding but does not relieve the highly distributive behavior of the enzyme caused by robust binding to the reaction product through the catalytic domain. Importantly, the positive effect exerted by the N-terminal region on ROS1 activity is highly dependent on substrate length. We have found that removal of the N terminus does not significantly affect 5-meC excision from short molecules, but strongly decreases ROS1 activity on long DNA substrates. This length-dependent effect strongly suggests that 5-meC recognition involves initial nonspecific binding events to nontarget sites followed by sliding along DNA. The idea of DNA sliding as a diffusion process that effectively reduces search dimensions and facilitates target location was originally proposed for the E. coli lac repressor-operator interaction (29.von Hippel P.H. Berg O.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has found experimental support in a number of systems, including the highly processive T4 pyrimidine dimer glycosylase (30.Lloyd R.S. Mutat. Res. 2005; 577: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Direct evidence of fast DNA glycosylase sliding along DNA has been obtained for human hOGG1 (31.Blainey P.C. van Oijen A.M. Banerjee A. Verdine G.L. Xie X.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 5752-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and E. coli Ung (32.Porecha R.H. Stivers J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10791-10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with the idea that ROS1 first binds DNA nonspecifically and then slides randomly toward its target base along the DNA molecule. We speculate that when 5-meC is present in short DNA molecules target detection by ROS1 is expected to approximate a three-dimensional search and, hence, be slow. This would explain why both the full-length and the N-terminally truncated enzyme display reduced activity on short (<20 bp) substrates. On the other hand, when 5-meC is located in long DNA molecules, target search may be accelerated by sliding. In this situation, a basic region affording nonspecific DNA binding capacity would allow ROS1 to scan the DNA in a one-dimensional diffusion, which might provide the enzyme with ample opportunity to recognize and excise a base modification that minimally affects DNA structure. To our knowledge, there are no published studies specifically addressing whether nonspecific DNA binding facilitates DNA glycosylase activity on long substrates. However, there is some evidence that basic domains are involved in efficient processing of specific target bases by other DNA glycosylases. Thus, deletion of a lysine-rich domain at the N terminus of human thymine DNA glycosylase selectively abolishes T·G processing, while decreasing only marginally the activity on U·G mispairs (33.Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 34.Steinacher R. Schär P. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 616-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, such a deletion is simultaneously accompanied by a drastic decrease in nonspecific DNA binding of the enzyme to homoduplex, undamaged DNA (34.Steinacher R. Schär P. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 616-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that T·G is a suboptimal substrate for thymine DNA glycosylase, compared with U·G, and that its processing is somehow facilitated by nonspecific DNA binding (35.Cortázar D. Kunz C. Saito Y. Steinacher R. Schär P. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 489-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Likewise, our results suggest that strong binding of ROS1 to DNA increases excision of a challenging target (a correctly paired 5-meC) but does not affect processing of a less demanding substrate (its mispaired deamination derivative, T). It is unclear how nonspecific DNA binding may influence substrate discrimination by DNA glycosylases. One possibility is that the structural and mechanistic features of target base binding are different for different substrates. A model suggested for E. coli Fpg, which excises 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine and less efficiently 5,6-dihydrouracil, postulates two modes of lesion binding. In the “run-on” mode the enzyme approaches the lesion while diffusing along DNA, whereas in the “jump-on” mode it binds in the immediate vicinity of the lesion (36.Zaika E.I. Perlow R.A. Matz E. Broyde S. Gilboa R. Grollman A.P. Zharkov D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4849-4861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The model proposes that Fpg forms productive complexes in both modes with 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, but only in the latter mode with 5,6-dihydrouracil (36.Zaika E.I. Perlow R.A. Matz E. Broyde S. Gilboa R. Grollman A.P. Zharkov D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4849-4861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In such a scenario, nonspecific DNA binding may specifically facilitate excision of just a subset of the base modifications potentially targeted by an enzyme. In summary, we found that methylation-independent DNA binding through a lysine-rich domain conserved across the ROS1/DME family selectively favors 5-meC over T excision and facilitates demethylation in long DNA substrates. It remains to be seen whether the accretion of basic domains that mediate nonspecific DNA binding has been a recurrent phenomenon in the evolution of DNA glycosylases able to excise suboptimal target bases.

https://openalex.org/W1989037221,"Background Nonrandom distribution of rearrangements is a common feature of eukaryotic chromosomes that is not well understood in terms of genome organization and evolution. In the major African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, polymorphic inversions are highly nonuniformly distributed among five chromosomal arms and are associated with epidemiologically important adaptations. However, it is not clear whether the genomic content of the chromosomal arms is associated with inversion polymorphism and fixation rates. Methodology/Principal Findings To better understand the evolutionary dynamics of chromosomal inversions, we created a physical map for an Asian malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, and compared it with the genome of An. gambiae. We also developed and deployed novel Bayesian statistical models to analyze genome landscapes in individual chromosomal arms An. gambiae. Here, we demonstrate that, despite the paucity of inversion polymorphisms on the X chromosome, this chromosome has the fastest rate of inversion fixation and the highest density of transposable elements, simple DNA repeats, and GC content. The highly polymorphic and rapidly evolving autosomal 2R arm had overrepresentation of genes involved in cellular response to stress supporting the role of natural selection in maintaining adaptive polymorphic inversions. In addition, the 2R arm had the highest density of regions involved in segmental duplications that clustered in the breakpoint-rich zone of the arm. In contrast, the slower evolving 2L, 3R, and 3L, arms were enriched with matrix-attachment regions that potentially contribute to chromosome stability in the cell nucleus. Conclusions/Significance These results highlight fundamental differences in evolutionary dynamics of the sex chromosome and autosomes and revealed the strong association between characteristics of the genome landscape and rates of chromosomal evolution. We conclude that a unique combination of various classes of genes and repetitive DNA in each arm, rather than a single type of repetitive element, is likely responsible for arm-specific rates of rearrangements."

https://openalex.org/W2089038151,"Serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been implicated as a novel component of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Recently we have demonstrated that mTOR regulates cell motility in part through p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) pathways. Little is known about the role of PP2A in the mTOR-mediated cell motility. Here we show that rapamycin inhibited the basal or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-induced motility of human Ewing sarcoma (Rh1) and rhabdomyosarcoma (Rh30) cells. Treatment of the cells with rapamycin activated PP2A activity, and concurrently inhibited IGF-1 stimulated phosphorylation of Erk1/2. Inhibition of Erk1/2 with PD98059 did not significantly affect the basal mobility of the cells, but dramatically inhibited IGF-1-induced cell motility. Furthermore, inhibition of PP2A with okadaic acid significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of Erk1/2 as well as cell motility. Consistently, expression of dominant negative PP2A conferred resistance to IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and cell motility. Expression of constitutively active MKK1 also attenuated rapamycin inhibition of IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and cell motility. The results suggest that rapamycin inhibits cell motility, in part by targeting PP2A-Erk1/2 pathway."

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Prior to 2007, two families of methionine-sulfoxide reductase (Msr) enzymes, called MsrA and -B were known to reduce Met-O back into Met (2Boschi-Muller S. Olry A. Antoine M. Branlant G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 3Moskovitz J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The MsrA family reduces the S isomer at the sulfoxide function, whereas MsrB is specific for the R isomer. Both Msrs, which reveal distinct unrelated folds, were shown to reduce more efficiently a Met-O within a polypeptide chain. Therefore, Msrs are repair enzymes that play important roles in the protection of cells against oxidative stress (3Moskovitz J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 4Stadtman E.R. Van Remmen H. Richardson A. Wehr N.B. Levine R.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 2005; 1703: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).The catalytic mechanism of MsrA and MsrB is now well documented. For most MsrAs and MsrBs (i.e. those possessing a recycling Cys), the mechanism comprises three steps: a reductase step that leads to formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate on a catalytic Cys (6Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Talfournier F. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35908-35913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), a second step in which a disulfide bond is formed between the catalytic Cys and a recycling Cys, and finally, a step in which the intradisulfide bond is reduced by thioredoxin (Trx) or a Trx-like protein (7Boschi-Muller S. Gand A. Branlant G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 474: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A catalytic residue (i.e. Glu94 in MsrA and His103 in MsrB) was characterized, one of whose major roles is to protonate the oxygen of the sulfoxide function (8Antoine M. Gand A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39062-39070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Neiers F. Sonkaria S. Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32397-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In all of the MsrAs and MsrBs studied to date, the reduction of the disulfide bond is rate-limiting, whereas the formation of the sulfenic acid intermediate is rate-determining in the process leading to intradisulfide bond formation. In other words, in the absence of Trx, only the intradisulfide intermediate accumulates.Recently, a third family of Msr, named fRMsr, was discovered (10Lin Z. Johnson L.C. Weissbach H. Brot N.

GAF domains are one of the largest and most widespread domains found in all kingdoms of life. They are dimeric and are generally arranged in tandem in modular proteins to provide a large variety of regulation functions. However, most of the functions of GAF domains remain to be studied in detail. The fRMsr is the first case of a GAF domain that bears a catalytic activity. The fRMsrs are present in eubacteria and unicellular eukaryotes (11Le D.T. Lee B.C. Marino S.M. Zhang Y. Fomenko D.E. Kaya A. Hacioglu E. Kwak G.H. Koc A. Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol.

Both structures are described as being composed of six β-strands, four α-helices, and two prominent loops, loop 1 and loop 2, located on the surface of the protein between β2 and β3 and between β4 and β5, respectively. Formation of a disulfide bond between Cys84 of loop 1 and Cys118 of loop 2 is assumed to close off the cavity in which a molecule of MES, which derives from the crystallization buffer, is bound in the E. coli enzyme (Protein Data Bank entry 1vhm). The sulfonic acid moiety is closed to another Cys94, which is located at the N terminus of an α-helix. The rest of the cavity is lined by several invariant residues. From the inspection of the crystal structure of E. coli fRMr in complex with a MES buffer molecule and by carrying out computational docking of Met-R-O into the cavity of the S. cerevisiae enzyme, a reductase mechanism was proposed in which the Cys94 located at one of the sides of the cavity is assumed to be the catalytic Cys (10Lin Z. Johnson L.C. Weissbach H. Brot N. Lively M.O. Lowther W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9597-9602Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The sulfenic acid postulated to be formed on Cys94 is then attacked by Cys118, forming a disulfide bond. A disulfide bond exchange then occurs with Cys84, which finally leads to the Cys118–Cys84 disulfide intermediate.In the present study, we report the crystal structure of the fRMsr from Neisseria meningitidis in complex with l-Met-R-O, solved at 1.25 Å resolution. By combining genomic analyses, structural information, and biochemical and kinetic data from the wild type and mutants in which Cys was substituted by Ala, Cys118 is shown to be the catalytic residue on which the sulfenic acid is formed. 5The numbering of fRMsr amino acid residues is based on the numbering of the E. coli fRMsr sequence according to sequence alignment presented in Fig. 1. All of the molecular and structural factors involved in the stereoselective binding of the l-Met-R-O stereoisomer are identified from the crystal structure and explain why neither a Met-S-O, a Met-R-O in a peptide or a protein context, nor a DMSO molecule are substrates. Scenarios for both substrate binding and catalysis are proposed for the reductase step.A disulfide bond between Cys84 and Cys118, present in all of the fRMsr crystal structures described so far, including the N. meningitidis fRMsr, stabilized the loop 2 as a flap that is an integral part of the active site. Formation of this disulfide bond seems to be a prerequisite to obtaining crystals. However, it is the free reduced form that is catalytically relevant to the reductase step. Based on the content of 1) the Cys in wild type and Cys-to-Ala mutants before and after Met-O reduction and 2) the Cys titrated under native conditions, a scenario for the Trx-recycling process is proposed in which a disulfide Cys118–Cys84 bond is formed first. All of the results are compared with those obtained for MsrA and MsrB and discussed in terms of the evolution of function of the GAF domain.DISCUSSIONA scenario of the catalytic mechanism, similar to that of MsrA and MsrB, can be proposed for fRMsr based on the genomic, biochemical, kinetic, and structural analyses carried out in the present study. First, a sulfenic acid intermediate is formed on the catalytic Cys118. This conclusion is based on four types of data. First, only the substitution of Cys118 by Ala leads to a complete loss of activity, whereas the mutants in which the other three Cys are individually substituted with Ala, in particular the C84A and C94A mutants, remain active under steady-state conditions. These latter results contradict those described for fRMsr from S. cerevisiae, for which substitution of Cys94 and Cys84 by Ser led to a complete loss of activity (11Le D.T. Lee B.C. Marino S.M. Zhang Y. Fomenko D.E. Kaya A. Hacioglu E. Kwak G.H. Koc A. Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4354-4364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Second, the C84A/C94A/C136A mutant is active when tested under steady-state conditions with the Trx-regenerating system. Third, in the absence of Trx, several species with the C84A/C94A/C136A mutant are efficiently formed, including a covalent intermediate, which migrates as a dimer of fRMsr on denaturating SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Its mass corresponds to a dimer linked by a thiosulfinate bond (data not shown). Because formation of a thiosulfinate bond can only proceed via condensation of two sulfenic acids, this result demonstrates that reduction of Met-O passes through the sulfenic acid chemistry. Fourth, inspection of the alignment of the 358 protein sequences of putative fRMsrs deduced from the DNA sequences available to date shows that Cys118 is invariant, whereas Cys84 and Cys94 are 94.5 and 98.6% conserved (see the alignment shown in supplemental Fig. S1). Taken together, these data definitively prove that 1) Cys118 is the catalytic Cys and 2) the catalytic mechanism involves the formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate on Cys118. Therefore, these results exclude Cys94 as the catalytic Cys as postulated from molecular modeling on the S. cerevisiae fRMsr (11Le D.T. Lee B.C. Marino S.M. Zhang Y. Fomenko D.E. Kaya A. Hacioglu E. Kwak G.H. Koc A. Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4354-4364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and from inspection of the E. coli fRMsr in complex with a MES molecule trapped from the crystallization buffer (10Lin Z. Johnson L.C. Weissbach H. Brot N. Lively M.O. Lowther W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9597-9602Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).The crystal structure of the N. meningitidis fRMsr in complex with l-Met-R-O illuminates not only the catalysis of the reductase step but also how fRMsr binds Met-O with a strong preference for the l-Met-R-O isomer. As already indicated, the catalysis implies a proton transfer from the catalytic Cys to the oxygen of the sulfoxide. Such a function in fRMsr is probably played by the invariant Asp143, which is located on strand β6, possibly via Wat125. In accord with this assumption, a D143A fRMsr shows a 350-fold decrease in activity (data not shown), similar to that observed for E94A MsrA and H103A MsrB, when determined under similar steady-state conditions (8Antoine M. Gand A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39062-39070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Neiers F. Sonkaria S. Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32397-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The crystal structure also shows that the oxygen of the sulfoxide is located in a hydrophilic cavity, where it strongly interacts not only with Asp143 but also with Wat99, which is itself hydrogen-bonded with the main chain nitrogen of Ser119. Wat99 recalls the water molecule observed in MsrB that is stabilized through a hydrogen-bonding network with the side chains of Thr26, His100, and Asn119 (21Ranaivoson F.M. Neiers F. Kauffmann B. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. Favier F. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 394: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the scenario, a sulfurane intermediate/transition state is formed that rearranges into a sulfenic acid intermediate (see Scheme 1A). Therefore, Asp143 and Wat99 should interact not only with the oxygen of the sulfoxide and its polarized form but probably also with the OH of the sulfurane transition state and directly or indirectly with the OH of the sulfenic acid, as observed in the crystal structure of the MsrA sulfenic acid intermediate (22Ranaivoson F.M. Antoine M. Kauffmann B. Boschi-Muller S. Aubry A. Branlant G. Favier F. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 268-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To form a sulfurane, the Cys118 has to be under the thiolate form to attack the sulfur of the sulfoxide, the geometry of which is tetrahedral. Clearly, because the pKapp of Cys118 in the free enzyme is 8.5, binding of the substrate should contribute to the decrease of the pKapp of Cys118. This situation is similar to that observed in MsrA and MsrB. As shown by the crystal structure, the sulfur is closer to Cys118 than to Cys84, and consequently it is in a better position to form a covalent bond with Cys118. Moreover, if Cys118 is reduced, the thiolate can adopt a favorable orientation that permits formation of the sulfurane with the SH and the OH groups in apical positions.As shown previously (10Lin Z. Johnson L.C. Weissbach H. Brot N. Lively M.O. Lowther W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9597-9602Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), fRMsrs only reduce the R isomer at the sulfoxide function. This stereochemical preference is confirmed by the structure of N. meningitidis fRMsr in complex with l-Met-R-O. The methyl group of the sulfoxide points perpendicularly toward the indole ring of the invariant Trp62, whose conformation is strongly stabilized within the active site. Therefore, the indole ring is the major factor involved in the binding and stabilization of the ɛ-methyl group, as already observed in MsrA and MsrB, where at minimum a Trp residue is involved. The β- and δ-methylene groups are stabilized by van der Waals interactions with the side chains of the invariant Ile87, Ile116, and Tyr66. Together, these structural data explain why only the R isomer at the sulfoxide function is recognized by the fRMsrs.As shown in the present study from kinetic studies, fRMsr is highly selective for the l-isomer at the Cα carbon. Moreover, as already described, it is the free form of Met-O that is active. Inspection of the crystal structure of fRMsr shows the following. 1) The negatively charge of the carboxylate function, which is completely delocalized, is buried and points toward the positive helix dipole at the N-terminal end of the helix α3. In addition, the backbone amides of Val93, Cys94, and Ile116 are within hydrogen distance and form an oxyanion hole. A similar situation is observed with the negative charge of the sulfonic acid function of the MES molecule in the E. coli fRMsr (10Lin Z. Johnson L.C. Weissbach H. Brot N. Lively M.O. Lowther W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9597-9602Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the negatively charged 3′,5′-cyclic phosphate of cGMP and cAMP in the phosphodiesterase 5A (23Heikaus C.C. Stout J.R. Sekharan M.R. Eakin C.M. Rajagopal P. Brzovic P.S. Beavo J.A. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22749-22759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and adenylate cyclase from Anabaena (24Martinez S.E. Bruder S. Schultz A. Zheng N. Schultz J.E. Beavo J.A. Linder J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3082-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), respectively. 2) The NH3+ group is strongly stabilized by a hydrogen-bonding network involving (i) the side chain of the invariant Glu125, which itself is stabilized by interactions with the invariant Asp141 and Asp143, and (ii) the main chain oxygen of Ile116. All of these stabilizing interactions 1) favor binding of the l-Met-O epimer, 2) prevent the binding of a Met-R-O within a peptide or protein context due to steric hindrance, and 3) are responsible for the absence of activity with DMSO because of the absence of COO− and NH3+ groups in DMSO.As clearly revealed by the crystal structure, the l-Met-R-O is strongly bound in a small cavity that is capped by the flap (residues 107–124, including Cys118), which thus protects the active site from the solvent. In the structure, the Cys84–Cys118 disulfide bond should restrict the conformational freedom of the flap, which is situated between strands β4 and β5, respectively. Because Cys118 has to be free to play its catalytic role, the disulfide-bonded Cys118–Cys84 form is not catalytically relevant for the reductase step. Nevertheless, the positioning of Cys118 is compatible with a nucleophilic attack of the sulfoxide function of the substrate. The disulfide bond Cys118–Cys84 is, however, essential to obtaining crystals because the addition of DTT dissolves them (data not shown) and thus prevents obtention of crystals of the reduced form.Formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate on Cys118 implies a recycling process in the wild type that can involve formation of an intradisulfide bond, which is then reduced by Trx. Two Cys, Cys94 or Cys84, could be implicated. All of the fRMsr mutants in which either Cys84 or Cys94 was substituted by Ala were active. In agreement with these results is the fact that 5.6 and 1.4% of the putative sequences of fRMsrs only contain the signatures Cys118/Cys94 and Cys118/Cys84, respectively (see the alignment shown in supplemental Fig. S1). When Cys118 and Cys94 were individually mutated to Ala in the wild type from N. meningitidis, a stoichiometry of 1 mol of Met/subunit was observed in the absence of Trx with formation of a disulfide bond between Cys118 and Cys94 or between Cys118 and Cys84, depending on the mutant considered. Such results are based on the difference in thiol content observed before and after the addition of Met-O. For the wild type and the C136A fRMsr, a stoichiometry of 1 mol of Met/subunit was also observed with formation of a disulfide bond, the nature of which remains to be determined. Because 1) the disulfide bond in the crystal is between Cys118 and Cys84 when Met-O is bound, 2) Cys94 is located at the N terminus of helix α3 on one of the two sides of the active site far away from Cys118 and Cys84 (i.e. ∼8 Å), and 3) Cys118 is located within the flap, it is probable that the first disulfide formed for recycling the activity of the fRMsr from N. meningitidis is Cys118–Cys84 (see Scheme 1B). This is in accord with the DTNB titration results obtained under native conditions, which showed that Cys118 and Cys84 are titrated by DTNB and formed a disulfide bond in the wild type and C136A/C94A mutant. In fact, one of the two Cys residues, probably Cys118 that is located on the flexible flap forms an adduct with the TNB− moiety, which, by an intramolecular attack of Cys84, leads to formation of the Cys84–Cys118 disulfide bond. When one of these two Cys residues, either Cys84 or Cys118, is substituted by Ala, Cys94 is now titrated together with either Cys118 or Cys84, respectively, and thus is accessible. But no disulfide bond between Cys94 and either Cys118 or Cys84 is formed, in contrast to that observed between Cys118 and Cys84. Clearly, formation of the Cys84–Cys118 disulfide bond in the wild type prevents accessibility of the DTNB to Cys94, whereas in the absence of the Cys84–Cys118 disulfide bond, as is the case for the C118A or C84A mutant, Cys94 becomes accessible to DTNB.The fact that only one Met molecule was formed in the wild type and in the C136A mutant requires explanation. Either Cys118 remains engaged in a disulfide bond with Cys84, it participates in a new disulfide bond with Cys94, or it is free. The last hypothesis, although less probable, implies formation of a Cys84–Cys94 disulfide bond and an active site that is no longer catalytically competent to reduce another Met-O molecule. In other words, formation of the Cys84–Cys94 disulfide bond would perturb the conformation of the active site, which in return would prevent efficient binding of l-Met-R-O. In any case, the behavior of the wild-type fRMsr is clearly different from that of the MsrA from E. coli (6Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Talfournier F. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35908-35913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Indeed, the E. coli MsrA, which also possesses three Cys residues, forms two successive disulfide bonds, first between the catalytic Cys51 and the recycling Cys198 and then between Cys198 and Cys206. In that case, formation of the second disulfide bond renders the catalytic Cys51 free and renders the active site competent to reduce a second molecule of Met-O.The fact that oxidized disulfide forms of fRMsr are formed (i.e. containing a Cys118–Cys84 or Cys118–Cys94 bond) or would be formed in the absence of reductant (i.e. Cys84–Cys94) does not mean that all of these oxidized forms are catalytically competent under steady-state conditions (i.e. in the presence of Trx). For instance, in the 5.6% of putative fRMsrs where only Cys94 is present, a disulfide bond probably forms between Cys118 and Cys94 in the absence of reductant, as shown for the C84A/C136A fRMsr from N. meningitidis. However, inspection of the crystal structure shows, as already pointed out, that Cys94 is situated at one of the sides of the active site far away from Cys118. Thus, Cys94 is not in a good position to form a Cys118–Cys94 bond efficiently unless the enzyme is highly flexible. At present, we do not know the rate at which this disulfide bond is formed in the C84A mutant and whether it is this form that is recognized and reduced by Trx.Like all GAF domains, fRMsr is dimeric. An obvious question is whether not only both subunits of fRMsr are active as shown in the absence of Trx but also express their activity with the same catalytic efficiency. Another question concerns the nature of the rate-limiting step. This has to be determined in order to validate the amino acids that play a role in the catalysis and in the substrate specificity in the reductase step.The fRMsr represents a unique case in which a GAF fold behaves as an enzyme and moreover as an independent folded unit not included in a modular larger protein. Like MsrA and MsrB, it catalyzes the reduction of Met-O and therefore constitutes the third protein fold to exhibit a Met-O reductase activity that involves the sulfenic acid chemistry. From a structural point of view, the active site of fRMsr is clearly different from those of MsrA and MsrB. All of the amino acids within the active site that underlie the l-Met-R-O reductase activity are not present in the other GAF domains. From an evolutionary point of view, this observation raises the question of how a GAF fold has evolved to acquire a broad range of different functions by binding various molecules, including cyclic nucleotides, heme, amino acids, or Met-O.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Prior to 2007, two families of methionine-sulfoxide reductase (Msr) enzymes, called MsrA and -B were known to reduce Met-O back into Met (2Boschi-Muller S. Olry A. Antoine M. Branlant G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 3Moskovitz J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The MsrA family reduces the S isomer at the sulfoxide function, whereas MsrB is specific for the R isomer. Both Msrs, which reveal distinct unrelated folds, were shown to reduce more efficiently a Met-O within a polypeptide chain. Therefore, Msrs are repair enzymes that play important roles in the protection of cells against oxidative stress (3Moskovitz J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 4Stadtman E.R. Van Remmen H. Richardson A. Wehr N.B. Levine R.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 2005; 1703: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).The catalytic mechanism of MsrA and MsrB is now well documented. For most MsrAs and MsrBs (i.e. those possessing a recycling Cys), the mechanism comprises three steps: a reductase step that leads to formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate on a catalytic Cys (6Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Talfournier F. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35908-35913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), a second step in which a disulfide bond is formed between the catalytic Cys and a recycling Cys, and finally, a step in which the intradisulfide bond is reduced by thioredoxin (Trx) or a Trx-like protein (7Boschi-Muller S. Gand A. Branlant G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 474: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A catalytic residue (i.e. Glu94 in MsrA and His103 in MsrB) was characterized, one of whose major roles is to protonate the oxygen of the sulfoxide function (8Antoine M. Gand A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39062-39070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Neiers F. Sonkaria S. Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32397-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In all of the MsrAs and MsrBs studied to date, the reduction of the disulfide bond is rate-limiting, whereas the formation of the sulfenic acid intermediate is rate-determining in the process leading to intradisulfide bond formation. In other words, in the absence of Trx, only the intradisulfide intermediate accumulates.Recently, a third family of Msr, named fRMsr, was discovered (10Lin Z. Johnson L.C. Weissbach H. Brot N. Lively M.O. Lowther W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9597-9602Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The fRMsrs exhibit a GAF-type fold. GAF domains are one of the largest and most widespread domains found in all kingdoms of life. They are dimeric and are generally arranged in tandem in modular proteins to provide a large variety of regulation functions. However, most of the functions of GAF domains remain to be studied in detail. The fRMsr is the first case of a GAF domain that bears a catalytic activity. The fRMsrs are present in eubacteria and unicellular eukaryotes (11Le D.T. Lee B.C. Marino S.M. Zhang Y. Fomenko D.E. Kaya A. Hacioglu E. Kwak G.H. Koc A. Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol.

The family displays a methionine-sulfoxide reductase activity, reducing selectively free Met-O with an R configuration at the sulfoxide (10Lin Z. Johnson L.C. Weissbach H. Brot N. Lively M.O.

Both structures are described as being composed of six β-strands, four α-helices, and two prominent loops, loop 1 and loop 2, located on the surface of the protein between β2 and β3 and between β4 and β5, respectively. Formation of a disulfide bond between Cys84 of loop 1 and Cys118 of loop 2 is assumed to close off the cavity in which a molecule of MES, which derives from the crystallization buffer, is bound in the E. coli enzyme (Protein Data Bank entry 1vhm). The sulfonic acid moiety is closed to another Cys94, which is located at the N terminus of an α-helix. The rest of the cavity is lined by several invariant residues. From the inspection of the crystal structure of E. coli fRMr in complex with a MES buffer molecule and by carrying out computational docking of Met-R-O into the cavity of the S. cerevisiae enzyme, a reductase mechanism was proposed in which the Cys94 located at one of the sides of the cavity is assumed to be the catalytic Cys (10Lin Z. Johnson L.C. Weissbach H. Brot N. Lively M.O. Lowther W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9597-9602Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The sulfenic acid postulated to be formed on Cys94 is then attacked by Cys118, forming a disulfide bond. A disulfide bond exchange then occurs with Cys84, which finally leads to the Cys118–Cys84 disulfide intermediate.In the present study, we report the crystal structure of the fRMsr from Neisseria meningitidis in complex with l-Met-R-O, solved at 1.25 Å resolution. By combining genomic analyses, structural information, and biochemical and kinetic data from the wild type and mutants in which Cys was substituted by Ala, Cys118 is shown to be the catalytic residue on which the sulfenic acid is formed. 5The numbering of fRMsr amino acid residues is based on the numbering of the E. coli fRMsr sequence according to sequence alignment presented in Fig. 1. All of the molecular and structural factors involved in the stereoselective binding of the l-Met-R-O stereoisomer are identified from the crystal structure and explain why neither a Met-S-O, a Met-R-O in a peptide or a protein context, nor a DMSO molecule are substrates. Scenarios for both substrate binding and catalysis are proposed for the reductase step.A disulfide bond between Cys84 and Cys118, present in all of the fRMsr crystal structures described so far, including the N. meningitidis fRMsr, stabilized the loop 2 as a flap that is an integral part of the active site. Formation of this disulfide bond seems to be a prerequisite to obtaining crystals. However, it is the free reduced form that is catalytically relevant to the reductase step. Based on the content of 1) the Cys in wild type and Cys-to-Ala mutants before and after Met-O reduction and 2) the Cys titrated under native conditions, a scenario for the Trx-recycling process is proposed in which a disulfide Cys118–Cys84 bond is formed first. All of the results are compared with those obtained for MsrA and MsrB and discussed in terms of the evolution of function of the GAF domain."
https://openalex.org/W2140378007,"The SecYEG complex forms a protein-conducting channel in the inner membrane of <i>Escherichia coli</i> to support the translocation of secretory proteins in their unfolded state. The SecY channel is closed at the periplasmic face of the membrane by a small re-entrance loop that connects transmembrane segment 1 with 2b. This helical domain 2a is termed the plug domain. By the introduction of pairs of cysteines and crosslinkers, the plug domain was immobilized inside the channel and connected to transmembrane segment 10. Translocation was inhibited to various degrees depending on the position and crosslinker spacer length. With one of the crosslinked mutants translocation occurred unrestricted. Biochemical characterization of this mutant as well as molecular dynamics simulations suggest that only a limited movement of the plug domain suffices for translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2063635784,"Recent studies suggest that active resolution of the inflammatory response in animal models of arthritis may involve leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4))-dependent stimulation of ""intermediate"" prostaglandin production, which in turn favors the synthesis of ""downstream"" anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipoxins, resolvins, and protectins. We explored a putative mechanism involving LTB(4)-dependent control of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, the rate-limiting step in inflammatory prostaglandin biosynthesis. Indeed, LTB(4) potently up-regulated/stabilized interleukin-1beta-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression under conditions of COX-2 inhibitor-dependent blockade of PGE(2) release in human synovial fibroblasts (EC(50) = 16.5 + or - 1.7 nm for mRNA; 19 + or - 2.4 nm for protein, n = 4). The latter response was pertussis toxin-sensitive, and semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR confirmed the quantitative predominance of the BLT2 receptor. Transfection experiments, using human COX-2 promoter plasmids and chimeric luciferase-COX-2 mRNA 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) reporter constructs, revealed that LTB(4) exerted its stabilizing effect at the post-transcriptional level through a 116-bp adenylate/uridylate-rich sequence in the proximal region of the COX-2 3'-UTR. Using luciferase-COX-2 mRNA 3'-UTR reporter constructs and Ras/c-Raf expression and mutant constructs, we showed that the Ras/c-Raf/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling pathway mediated LTB(4)-dependent COX-2 mRNA stabilization. Knockdown experiments with specific short hairpin RNAs confirmed that LTB(4) stabilization of COX-2 mRNA was apparently mediated through the RNA-binding protein, p42 AUF1. The nuclear export of p42 AUF1 was driven by c-Raf/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling and sensitive to leptomycin B treatment, suggesting a CRM1-dependent mechanism. We conclude that LTB(4) may support the resolution phase of the inflammatory response by stabilizing COX-2, ensuring a reservoir of ambient pro-resolution lipid mediators."
https://openalex.org/W2004005417,"Background The genomic organization of Hox clusters is fundamental for the precise spatio-temporal regulation and the function of each Hox gene, and hence for correct embryo patterning. Multiple overlapping transcriptional units exist at the Hoxa5 locus reflecting the complexity of Hox clustering: a major form of 1.8 kb corresponding to the two characterized exons of the gene and polyadenylated RNA species of 5.0, 9.5 and 11.0 kb. This transcriptional intricacy raises the question of the involvement of the larger transcripts in Hox function and regulation. Methodology/Principal Findings We have undertaken the molecular characterization of the Hoxa5 larger transcripts. They initiate from two highly conserved distal promoters, one corresponding to the putative Hoxa6 promoter, and a second located nearby Hoxa7. Alternative splicing is also involved in the generation of the different transcripts. No functional polyadenylation sequence was found at the Hoxa6 locus and all larger transcripts use the polyadenylation site of the Hoxa5 gene. Some larger transcripts are potential Hoxa6/Hoxa5 bicistronic units. However, even though all transcripts could produce the genuine 270 a.a. HOXA5 protein, only the 1.8 kb form is translated into the protein, indicative of its essential role in Hoxa5 gene function. The Hoxa6 mutation disrupts the larger transcripts without major phenotypic impact on axial specification in their expression domain. However, Hoxa5-like skeletal anomalies are observed in Hoxa6 mutants and these defects can be explained by the loss of expression of the 1.8 kb transcript. Our data raise the possibility that the larger transcripts may be involved in Hoxa5 gene regulation. Significance Our observation that the Hoxa5 larger transcripts possess a developmentally-regulated expression combined to the increasing sum of data on the role of long noncoding RNAs in transcriptional regulation suggest that the Hoxa5 larger transcripts may participate in the control of Hox gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2029709951,"RNase BN, the Escherichia coli homolog of RNase Z, was previously shown to act as both a distributive exoribonuclease and an endoribonuclease on model RNA substrates and to be inhibited by the presence of a 3′-terminal CCA sequence.

Introduction3′-Maturation of tRNA precursors differs among organisms depending on whether or not the universal 3′-terminal CCA sequence is encoded (1.Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, this sequence is absent from tRNA precursors, and the 3′-processing step is catalyzed by the endoribonuclease, RNase Z or 3′-tRNase, which cleaves at the discriminator base to allow subsequent CCA addition by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (3.Redko Y. Li de la Sierra-Gallay I. Condon C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 5.Vogel A. Schilling O. Späth B. Marchfelder A. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, in some bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, the CCA sequence is encoded, and maturation of the 3′ terminus is carried out by exoribonucleases (8.Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9.Reuven N.B. Deutscher M.P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas in other organisms, such as Bacillus subtilis, both types of 3′-processing are operative (3.Redko Y. Li de la Sierra-Gallay I. Condon C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, in E. coli, despite the fact that the CCA sequence is present in all known tRNA precursors, an RNase Z homolog, termed RNase BN, is present (10.Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As a consequence, it has been of considerable interest to understand the function in E. coli of this apparently unnecessary enzyme.RNase BN was originally discovered as an enzyme required for the maturation of those bacteriophage T4 precursor tRNAs that lack a CCA sequence (11.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Subsequently, RNase BN was shown to also be able to process the CCA-encoded host E. coli tRNA precursors in vivo (8.Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9.Reuven N.B. Deutscher M.P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, of the five E. coli RNases able to carry out the 3′-processing reaction, RNase BN was the least efficient (12.Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6682-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13.Deutscher M.P. Li Z. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 67-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, under normal growth conditions, RNase BN is unlikely to function in total tRNA maturation, although it cannot be ruled out that the enzyme may participate in 3′-maturation of some select tRNA species (8.Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, because E. coli mutants lacking RNase BN grow essentially normally (14.Ezraty B. Dahlgren B. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16542-16545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15.Li Z. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 2006; 60: 723-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), either such tRNAs must be nonessential, or their 3′-maturation can also be carried out by other RNases.RNase BN was initially thought to be an exoribonuclease based on its ability to remove a mononucleotide residue from the 3′ terminus of synthetic tRNA precursors (11.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This conclusion was strengthened by the subsequent finding that the enzyme is also a zinc phosphodiesterase (10.Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, study of RNase Z enzymes from various other organisms showed that these enzymes are endoribonucleases (6.Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18.Pellegrini O. Nezzar J. Marchfelder A. Putzer H. Condon C.

Chem. 2005; 280: 14138-14144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the E. coli enzyme was also found to display endoribonuclease activity on certain tRNA precursors in vitro (14.Ezraty B. Dahlgren B. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16542-16545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20.Takaku H. Nashimoto M. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar). To help clarify this situation, we recently carried out a detailed analysis of RNase BN/RNase Z action on a variety of oligoribonucleotide substrates and showed that the enzyme can act both as a distributive exoribonuclease and an endoribonuclease depending on the nature of the substrate and on its 3′-terminal structure (21.Dutta T. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15425-15431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For example, the presence of a CCA sequence or a 3′-phosphoryl group was found to inhibit RNase BN (11.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21.Dutta T. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15425-15431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in a recent study (20.Takaku H. Nashimoto M. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar), it was suggested that RNase BN can act on E. coli tRNA precursors and that it can actually remove the CCA sequence. Hence, the mode of action of RNase BN on tRNA precursors, the effect of the CCA sequence on the activity of the enzyme, and what determines the catalytic specificity have been unclear.In this study, we analyzed the action of RNase BN on a variety of E. coli and phage T4 tRNA precursors. We show that RNase BN can act on tRNA precursors containing or lacking a CCA sequence and that it can do so as either an exoribonuclease or an endoribonuclease. However, its mode of cleavage is very dependent on the assay conditions, particularly with regard to the identity of the metal ion present. When conditions more closely resemble those thought to occur in vivo, RNase BN functions primarily as an endoribonuclease, although these are not necessarily the conditions under which RNase BN is most active. Thus, RNase BN specificity and efficiency can be greatly affected by assay conditions. Moreover, certain tRNA precursors are extremely poor substrates for RNase BN under any condition tested, which may explain why RNase BN is so poor at total tRNA maturation in vivo. These findings provide important information on the catalytic capabilities of RNase BN on tRNA precursors and help explain the known physiological properties of this enzyme.RESULTSThe action of E. coli RNase BN/RNase Z on tRNA precursors has remained unclear. In the earliest studies, RNase BN was shown to be required for maturation of certain phage T4 tRNA precursors that lack an encoded CCA sequence (11.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22.Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H. Cell. 1975; 5: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and such an activity is consistent with that of other RNase Z enzymes, which generally cleave after the discriminator residue (6.Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18.Pellegrini O. Nezzar J. Marchfelder A. Putzer H. Condon C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4534-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RNase BN also could act on the E. coli tRNA precursor analog tRNA-CCA-Cn in vitro (23.Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4577-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and on E. coli tRNA precursors in vivo to generate mature tRNAs (9.Reuven N.B. Deutscher M.P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12.Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6682-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicating that it could process CCA-containing precursors and that the CCA sequence was retained. These data also are consistent with our recent studies that showed that RNase BN can remove residues following a CCA sequence but that it slows dramatically at a CCA sequence in model RNA substrates (21.Dutta T. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15425-15431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Hence, the recent report of Takaku and Nashimoto (20.Takaku H. Nashimoto M. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar) that RNase BN cleaves mature and precursor E. coli tRNAs to remove the CCA sequence was quite surprising. As a consequence, we have re-examined the action of RNase BN on representative E. coli tRNA precursors that contain a CCA sequence and also on a phage T4 precursor and a B. subtilis precursor that lack the CCA sequence to ascertain the products of RNase BN action and to determine whether RNase BN functions as an exoribonuclease or endoribonuclease on these substrates.Action of RNase BN on a CCA-less tRNA PrecursorRNase Z enzymes from most organisms cleave tRNA precursors lacking a CCA sequence in an endonucleolytic fashion right after the discriminator nucleotide to generate a substrate for subsequent CCA addition by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (1.Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2.Deutscher M.P. Soll D. Rajbhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function.

To determine the mode of action of RNase BN on a tRNA precursor of this type, we prepared by in vitro transcription the phage T4 dimeric tRNAPro-Ser precursor (Fig. 1A), known to be a substrate for 3′-processing by RNase BN in vivo (23.Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4577-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Seidman J.G. McClain W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1975; 72: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26.Deutscher M.P. Foulds J. McClain W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6696-6699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This RNA was treated with purified RNase BN, and the products were analyzed in detail.As shown in Fig. 1B, treatment with RNase BN led to the disappearance of the 32P-labeled dimeric precursor with the concomitant increase in a slightly shorter product that migrated in the position of the dimer from which the 3′-terminal UAA residues have been removed. To confirm that RNase BN removes the 3 precursor-specific residues from the 3′-end of tRNASer, the RNase BN cleavage reaction was repeated with nonradioactive precursor in the presence of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, CTP, and [α-32P]ATP. If the complete UAA sequence were removed by RNase BN, tRNA nucleotidyltransferase would add CC-32P-A following the discriminator nucleotide. That this occurs is shown in Fig. 1C. No [32P]AMP was incorporated into the dimeric precursor in the absence of RNase BN, but there was considerable incorporation (0.46 pmol) when RNase BN was present. This level of incorporation amounted to ∼85% of the tRNA precursor added. As a control, [32P]AMP incorporation into tRNAPro-Ser lacking the UAA residues was also measured. In this case, incorporation continued for 30 min and did not yet reach a limit. The higher level in the presence of RNase BN appears to be due to some cleavage of the dimeric precursor by RNase BN to individual tRNAPro and tRNASer, resulting in additional 3′ termini for CCA addition. This was confirmed by gel electrophoresis, which showed monomer-sized tRNA products (data not shown).Of most interest to understanding the mode of action of RNase BN is the question of whether the UAA residues at the 3′ terminus of the dimeric precursor are removed by a single endonucleolytic cleavage or by exoribonucleolytic trimming because RNase BN has the capacity for either activity (21.Dutta T. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15425-15431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To answer this question, [32P]pCp was added to the 3′ terminus, followed by removal of the 3′-phosphoryl group by phosphatase. The resulting labeled precursor was treated with RNase BN, and the cleavage products were analyzed on a 20% denaturing acrylamide gel. Fig. 1D shows that the major product produced was a tetranucleotide, with essentially no [32P]CMP evident. These data demonstrate that RNase BN removes the 3 extra nucleotides in pre-tRNAPro-Ser by endonucleolytic cleavage rather than by exonucleolytic trimming.Action of RNase BN on a tRNA Precursor with a Long 3′-TrailerIt was recently suggested that E. coli RNase Z cannot cleave pre-tRNAs with 3′-trailer sequences >6 nt (20.Takaku H. Nashimoto M. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar). This observation is surprising considering that RNase BN/RNase Z can function to mature all E. coli tRNA precursors in a strain lacking other tRNA-processing exoribonucleases (8.Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 12.Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6682-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To re-examine this point in more detail, we prepared 32P-labeled B. subtilis pre-tRNAThr. This RNA contains tRNAThr plus an 83-nt 3′-trailer and is known to be cleaved by the B. subtilis RNase Z after the discriminator nucleotide (18.Pellegrini O. Nezzar J. Marchfelder A. Putzer H. Condon C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4534-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The precursor was treated with purified RNase BN, and the data from this experiment are presented in Fig. 2. RNase BN efficiently cleaved the 156-nt precursor to generate, as the major products, the 73-nt CCA-less tRNAThr and a second, slightly longer product corresponding to the 83-nt 3′-trailer. Interestingly, RNase BN also cleaved the precursor at a second position within the 3′-trailer to generate a product ∼115 nt in length and a smaller fragment from the 3′-trailer. This ∼115-nt product slowly disappeared with time, presumably due to an additional RNase BN cleavage after the discriminator residue that also generated tRNAThr. Nevertheless, these data clearly show that RNase BN can endonucleolytically cleave even long 3′-trailer sequences from tRNA precursors. A small amount of [32P]AMP also accumulated with increasing time of reaction due to the exoribonuclease activity of RNase BN (11.Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21.Dutta T. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15425-15431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), most likely resulting from subsequent action on some of the product fragments generated by the initial endonucleolytic cleavages.FIGURE 2Processing of B. subtilis tRNAThr precursor.

Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar) that RNase BN removes the CCA sequence, we prepared several E. coli precursors by in vitro transcription and treated them with purified enzyme. We chose initially pre-tRNAPheV (Fig. 3A), a substrate studied in detail by Takaku and Nashimoto (20.Takaku H. Nashimoto M. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar). Two variants were prepared containing either 3 or 6 nt following the CCA sequence. As shown in the Northern analyses in Fig. 3 (B and C), RNase BN converted each precursor to the size of mature tRNAPhe. No products shorter than the mature form were detectable. Moreover, RNase BN did not remove any residues from mature tRNAPhe (Fig. 3D). Thus, contrary to the results of Takaku and Nashimoto (20.Takaku H. Nashimoto M. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar), under the assay conditions used, we found no evidence for removal of the CCA sequence by RNase BN.FIGURE 3Maturation of tRNAPheV precursor by RNase BN. A, shown is the structure of the E. coli tRNAPhe precursor. The discriminator nucleotide is shown in boldface. B, the tRNAPhe precursor (0.05 μm) with 6 extra 3′-residues after the CCA sequence was treated with RNase BN (0.14 μm), and the cleavage products were analyzed by 6% denaturing PAGE, followed by Northern blotting with a 5′-probe. C, the conditions were the same as described for B except that the precursor has 3 extra 3′-nt. D, the conditions were the same as described for B except that the substrate was mature (M) tRNAPhe. E and F, tRNAPhe labeled with [32P]pC at its 3′-end (48 nm) was treated with RNase BN (0.14 μm) in the presence of either Co2+ at pH 6.5 (E) or Mg2+ at pH 7.5 (F). The cleavage products were analyzed by 20% denaturing PAGE. Quantitation of the data from experiments similar to those in E and F is shown below the gels.

Interestingly, with the pre-tRNA containing 6 extra 3′-residues, both [32P]CMP and a 32P-labeled 7-mer oligonucleotide were released as the major products at a ratio of ∼3:1, respectively (Fig. 3E). A small amount of dinucleotide was also noted, suggesting that cleavage may also occur within the 3′-trailer. From these data, we concluded that RNase BN can remove extra residues following the CCA sequence by either an exonucleolytic or endonucleolytic mechanism. Both exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic products were also obtained when the shorter pre-tRNAPhe was the substrate, and CMP was again the major product (data not shown). Thus, under the assay conditions used (Co2+, pH 6.5), the exonucleolytic mode of processing predominates. However, as shown below, the mode of processing can be altered dramatically by a change in assay conditions.The second E. coli tRNA precursor examined was that of tRNASelC. In previous work from our laboratory (12.Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6682-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it was shown that this tRNA was matured even in the absence of the major tRNA-processing exoribonucleases, suggesting that another enzyme, such as RNase BN, might be involved. Pre-tRNASelC with 4 nt following the CCA sequence (Fig. 4A) was synthesized and treated with purified RNase BN. The data in Fig. 4B show, by Northern analysis, that RNase BN readily converted the precursor to the size of the mature tRNA. Identical results were obtained with [α-32P]-labeled precursor (data not shown), confirming the Northern data. Furthermore, there was no reduction in size upon treatment of mature tRNASelC with RNase BN (Fig. 4C). Thus, for tRNASelC as well, there is no evidence for removal of the CCA sequence.FIGURE 4Maturation of tRNASelC precursor by RNase BN. A, shown is the structure of the E. coli tRNASelC precursor. The discriminator nucleotide is shown in boldface. B, the tRNASelC precursor (0.04 μm) with 4 extra residues after the CCA sequence was treated with RNase BN (0.14 μm), and the cleavage products were analyzed by 6% denaturing PAGE, followed by Northern blotting with a 5′-probe. C, the conditions were the same as described for B except that the substrate was mature (M) tRNASelC. D, tRNASelC (0.04 μm) labeled with [32P]pC at its 3′-end was treated with RNase BN (0.3 μg) in the presence of Co2+ at pH 6.5. Cleavage products were analyzed by 20% denaturing PAGE. E, the conditions were the same as described for D except that the tRNA was labeled with [3′-32P]pCp. F, the conditions were the same as described for D except that reaction was carried out with Mg2+ at pH 7.5. Quantitation of the data from experiments similar to those in D and F is shown below the relevant gels.

However, when the 3′-phosphoryl group from pCp addition was not removed, only the endonucleolytic product, a 5-nt long oligomer, was detectable (Fig. 4E), in keeping with the known inhibition of the exoribonuclease activity by a 3′-phosphoryl group (21.Dutta T. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15425-15431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As with tRNAPhe, assay conditions dramatically affected the mode of 3′-processing of pre-tRNASelC (see below).A third E. coli pre-tRNA, that of tRNACysT, which contained 4 nt following the CCA sequence (Fig. 5A), was also analyzed. Treatment of this precursor also generated a product that migrated with mature tRNACys (Fig. 5B), again providing no evidence for CCA removal. Determination of the mode of removal of the extra nucleotides using [3′-32P]CMP-labeled substrate, as described above, showed that CMP was the major product, indicating exoribonuclease action (Fig. 5C). However, in this case, a significant amount of dinucleotide was also generated by the endoribonuclease activity (Fig. 5C). Some anomalous internal cleavage was also observed (Fig. 5C). Assay conditions also affected processing of this tRNA precursor, as shown below.FIGURE 5Maturation of tRNACysT precursor by RNase BN. A, shown is the structure of the E. coli tRNACys precursor. The discriminator nucleotide is shown in boldface. B, uniformly 32P-labeled pre-tRNACys (0.05 μm) was used as the substrate.

However, because such conditions are unlikely to be present in vivo, we re-examined the mode of RNase BN action on the various pre-tRNAs using pH 7.5 in the presence of Mg2+. For the CCA-less precursors, tRNAPro-Ser (Fig. 1, D and E) and tRNAThr (data not shown), there was essentially no difference in the products generated or in their amounts. However, there were dramatic alterations in the products generated when the CCA-containing precursors were tested under the two assay conditions. Thus, f"

Sex differences in obesity rates are particularly poorly understood. Here we show that the strong female bias in obesity in many countries is associated with high total fertility rate, which is well known to be correlated with factors such as low average income, infant mortality and female education. We also document effects of reduced access to contraception and increased inequality of income among households on obesity rates. These results are consistent with studies that implicate reproduction as a risk factor for obesity in women and that suggest the effects of reproduction interact with socioeconomic and educational factors. We discuss our results in the light of recent research in dietary ecology and the suggestion that insulin resistance during pregnancy is due to historic adaptation to protect the developing foetus during famine. Increased access to contraception and education in countries with high total fertility rate might have the additional benefit of reducing the rates of obesity in women."
https://openalex.org/W2107047202,"The eukaryotic DNA replication protein Mcm10 associates with chromatin in early S-phase and is required for assembly and function of the replication fork protein machinery. Xenopus laevis (X) Mcm10 binds DNA via a highly conserved internal domain (ID) and a C-terminal domain (CTD) that is unique to higher eukaryotes. Although the structural basis of the interactions of the ID with DNA and polymerase alpha is known, little information is available for the CTD. We have identified the minimal DNA binding region of the XMcm10-CTD and determined its three-dimensional structure by solution NMR. The CTD contains a globular domain composed of two zinc binding motifs. NMR chemical shift perturbation and mutational analysis show that ssDNA binds only to the N-terminal (CCCH-type) zinc motif, whose structure is unique to Mcm10. The second (CCCC-type) zinc motif is not involved in DNA binding. However, it is structurally similar to the CCCC zinc ribbon in the N-terminal oligomerization domain of eukaryotic and archaeal MCM helicases. NMR analysis of a construct spanning both the ID and CTD reveals that the two DNA binding domains are structurally independent in solution, supporting a modular architecture for vertebrate Mcm10. Our results provide insight in the action of Mcm10 in the replisome and support a model in which it serves as a central scaffold through coupling of interactions with partner proteins and the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2030162914,"Double strand breaks (DSBs) can be repaired by homology independent nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways involving proteins such as Ku70/80, DNAPKcs, Xrcc4/Ligase 4, and the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) complex. DSBs can also be repaired by homology-dependent pathways (HDR), in which the MRN and CtIP nucleases produce single strand ends that engage homologous sequences either by strand invasion or strand annealing. The entry of ends into HDR pathways underlies protocols for genomic manipulation that combine site-specific DSBs with appropriate informational donors. Most strategies utilize long duplex donors that participate by strand invasion. Work in yeast indicates that single strand oligonucleotide (SSO) donors are also active, over considerable distance, via a single strand annealing pathway. We examined the activity of SSO donors in mammalian cells at DSBs induced either by a restriction nuclease or by a targeted interstrand cross-link. SSO donors were effective immediately adjacent to the break, but activity declined sharply beyond approximately 100 nucleotides. Overexpression of the resection nuclease CtIP increased the frequency of SSO-mediated sequence modulation distal to the break site, but had no effect on the activity of an SSO donor adjacent to the break. Genetic and in vivo competition experiments showed that sequence conversion by SSOs in the immediate vicinity of the break was not by strand invasion or strand annealing pathways. Instead these donors competed for ends that would have otherwise entered NHEJ pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2001966117,"GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase is a Golgi-resident 540-kDa complex of three subunits, alpha(2)beta(2)gamma(2), that catalyze the first step in the formation of the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) recognition marker on lysosomal enzymes. Anti-M6P antibody analysis shows that human primary macrophages fail to generate M6P residues. Here we have explored the sorting and intracellular targeting of cathepsin D as a model, and the expression of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex in macrophages. Newly synthesized cathepsin D is transported to lysosomes in an M6P-independent manner in association with membranes whereas the majority is secreted. Realtime PCR analysis revealed a 3-10-fold higher GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase subunit mRNA levels in macrophages than in fibroblasts or HeLa cells. At the protein level, the gamma-subunit but not the beta-subunit was found to be proteolytically cleaved into three fragments which form irregular 97-kDa disulfide-linked oligomers in macrophages. Size exclusion chromatography showed that the gamma-subunit fragments lost the capability to assemble with other GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase subunits to higher molecular complexes. These findings demonstrate that proteolytic processing of the gamma-subunit represents a novel mechanism to regulate GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity and the subsequent sorting of lysosomal enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2080003023,"Global loss of DNA methylation and locus/gene-specific gain of DNA methylation are two distinct hallmarks of carcinogenesis. Aberrant DNA methylation is implicated in smoking-related lung cancer. In this study, we have comprehensively investigated the modulation of DNA methylation consequent to chronic exposure to a prototype smoke-derived carcinogen, benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (B[a]PDE), in genomic regions of significance in lung cancer, in normal human cells. We have used a pulldown assay for enrichment of the CpG methylated fraction of cellular DNA combined with microarray platforms, followed by extensive validation through conventional bisulfite-based analysis. Here, we demonstrate strikingly similar patterns of DNA methylation in non-transformed B[a]PDE-treated cells vs control using high-throughput microarray-based DNA methylation profiling confirmed by conventional bisulfite-based DNA methylation analysis. The absence of aberrant DNA methylation in our model system within a timeframe that precedes cellular transformation suggests that following carcinogen exposure, other as yet unknown factors (secondary to carcinogen treatment) may help initiate global loss of DNA methylation and region-specific gain of DNA methylation, which can, in turn, contribute to lung cancer development. Unveiling the initiating events that cause aberrant DNA methylation in lung cancer has tremendous public health relevance, as it can help define future strategies for early detection and prevention of this highly lethal disease."
https://openalex.org/W2069164769,"Social and echolocation vocalizations of bats contain different patterns of frequency modulations. An adult bat's ability to discriminate between various FM parameters, however, is not well established. Using changes in heart rate (HR) as a quantitative measure of associative learning, we demonstrate that mustached bats (Pteronotus parnellii) can be fear conditioned to linear frequency modulated (FM) sweeps typically centered at their acoustic fovea (∼60 kHz). We also show that HR is sensitive to a change in the direction of the conditional frequency modulation keeping all other parameters constant. In addition, a change in either depth or duration co-varied with FM rate is reflected in the change in HR. Finally, HR increases linearly with FM rate incremented by 0.1 kHz/ms from a pure tone to a target rate of 1.0 kHz/ms of the conditional stimulus. Learning is relatively rapid, occurring after a single training session. We also observed that fear conditioning enhances local field potential activity within the basolateral amygdala. Neural response enhancement coinciding with rapid learning and a fine scale cortical representation of FM sweeps shown earlier make FMs prime candidates for discriminating between different call types and possibly communicating socially relevant information within species-specific sounds."
https://openalex.org/W2057821478,"Background Multiple locus sequence typing (MLST) has become a central genotyping strategy for analysis of bacterial populations. The scheme involves de novo sequencing of 6–8 housekeeping loci to assign unique sequence types. In this work we adapted MLST to a rapid microfluidics platform in order to enhance speed and reduce laboratory labor time. Methodology/Principal Findings Using two integrated microfluidic devices, DNA was purified from 100 Bacillus cereus soil isolates, used as a template for multiplex amplification of 7 loci and sequenced on forward and reverse strands. The time on instrument from loading genomic DNA to generation of electropherograms was only 1.5 hours. We obtained full-length sequence of all seven MLST alleles from 84 representing 46 different Sequence Types. At least one allele could be sequenced from a further 15 strains. The nucleotide diversity of B. cereus isolated in this study from one location in Rockville, Maryland (0.04 substitutions per site) was found to be as great as the global collection of isolates. Conclusions/Significance Biogeographical investigation of pathogens is only one of a panoply of possible applications of microfluidics based MLST; others include microbiologic forensics, biothreat identification, and rapid characterization of human clinical samples."
https://openalex.org/W1981364281,"Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, while allergic contact dermatitis although immune mediated, is considered an exposure driven disease that develops due to epicutaneous contact with reactive low-molecular chemicals. The objective of the present study was to experimentally study the effect of contact allergens on the development of diabetes in NOD mice. As the link between contact allergy and diabetes is yet unexplained we also examined the effect of provocation with allergens on Natural Killer T (NKT) cells, since involvement of NKT cells could suggest an innate connection between the two diseases.NOD mice 4 weeks of age were exposed, on the ears, to two allergens, p-phenylenediamine and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene respectively, to investigate the diabetes development. The mice were followed for a maximum of 32 weeks, and they were either repeatedly exposed to the allergens or only sensitized a week after arrival. The stimulation of NKT cells by the two allergens were additionally studied in C57BL/6 mice. The mice were sensitized and two weeks later provocated with the allergens. The mice were subsequently euthanized at different time points after the provocation.It was found that repeated application of p-phenylenediamine reduced the incidence of diabetes compared to application with water (47% vs. 93%, P = 0.004). Moreover it was shown that in C57BL/6 mice both allergens resulted in a slight increment in the quantity of NKT cells in the liver. Application of the allergens at the same time resulted in an increased number of NKT cells in the draining auricular lymph node, and the increase appeared to be somewhat allergen specific as the accumulation was stronger for p-phenylenediamine.The study showed that repeated topical application on the ears with a contact allergen could prevent the development of diabetes in NOD mice. The contact allergens gave a non-visible, sub-clinical dermatitis on the application site. The preventive effect on diabetes may be due to stimulation of peripheral NKT cells, as shown for provocation with p-phenylenediamine in the C57BL/6 mouse. This epicutaneous procedure may lead to new strategies in prevention of type 1 diabetes in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2042967757,"Prm1p is a multipass membrane protein that promotes plasma membrane fusion during yeast mating. The mechanism by which Prm1p and other putative regulators of developmentally controlled cell-cell fusion events facilitate membrane fusion has remained largely elusive. Here, we report that Prm1p forms covalently linked homodimers. Covalent Prm1p dimer formation occurs via intermolecular disulfide bonds of two cysteines, Cys-120 and Cys-545. PRM1 mutants in which these cysteines have been substituted are fusion defective. These PRM1 mutants are normally expressed, retain homotypic interaction and can traffic to the fusion zone. Because prm1-C120S and prm1-C545S mutants can form covalent dimers when coexpressed with wild-type PRM1, an intermolecular C120-C545 disulfide linkage is inferred. Cys-120 is adjacent to a highly conserved hydrophobic domain. Mutation of a charged residue within this hydrophobic domain abrogates formation of covalent dimers, trafficking to the fusion zone, and fusion-promoting activity. The importance of intermolecular disulfide bonding informs models regarding the mechanism of Prm1-mediated cell-cell fusion."
