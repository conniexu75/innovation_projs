https://openalex.org/W3165120573,"Recent spatial gene expression technologies enable comprehensive measurement of transcriptomic profiles while retaining spatial context. However, existing analysis methods do not address the limited resolution of the technology or use the spatial information efficiently. Here, we introduce BayesSpace, a fully Bayesian statistical method that uses the information from spatial neighborhoods for resolution enhancement of spatial transcriptomic data and for clustering analysis. We benchmark BayesSpace against current methods for spatial and non-spatial clustering and show that it improves identification of distinct intra-tissue transcriptional profiles from samples of the brain, melanoma, invasive ductal carcinoma and ovarian adenocarcinoma. Using immunohistochemistry and an in silico dataset constructed from scRNA-seq data, we show that BayesSpace resolves tissue structure that is not detectable at the original resolution and identifies transcriptional heterogeneity inaccessible to histological analysis. Our results illustrate BayesSpace’s utility in facilitating the discovery of biological insights from spatial transcriptomic datasets. BayesSpace increases the resolution of spatial transcriptomics by using neighborhood information."
https://openalex.org/W3164839005,"Recent technological advances have enabled massively parallel chromatin profiling with scATAC-seq (single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin by sequencing). Here we present ATAC with select antigen profiling by sequencing (ASAP-seq), a tool to simultaneously profile accessible chromatin and protein levels. Our approach pairs sparse scATAC-seq data with robust detection of hundreds of cell surface and intracellular protein markers and optional capture of mitochondrial DNA for clonal tracking, capturing three distinct modalities in single cells. ASAP-seq uses a bridging approach that repurposes antibody:oligonucleotide conjugates designed for existing technologies that pair protein measurements with single-cell RNA sequencing. Together with DOGMA-seq, an adaptation of CITE-seq (cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing) for measuring gene activity across the central dogma of gene regulation, we demonstrate the utility of systematic multi-omic profiling by revealing coordinated and distinct changes in chromatin, RNA and surface proteins during native hematopoietic differentiation and peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulation and as a combinatorial decoder and reporter of multiplexed perturbations in primary T cells. Chromatin accessibility, gene expression and protein levels are measured in the same single cell."
https://openalex.org/W2474836229,"Inexpensive genotyping methods are essential for genetic studies requiring large sample sizes. In human studies, array-based microarrays and high-density haplotype reference panels allow efficient genotype imputation for this purpose. However, these resources are typically unavailable in non-human settings. Here we describe a method (STITCH) for imputation based only on sequencing read data, without requiring additional reference panels or array data. We demonstrate its applicability even in settings of extremely low sequencing coverage, by accurately imputing 5.7 million SNPs at a mean r(2) value of 0.98 in 2,073 outbred laboratory mice (0.15× sequencing coverage). In a sample of 11,670 Han Chinese (1.7× coverage), we achieve accuracy similar to that of alternative approaches that require a reference panel, demonstrating that our approach can work for genetically diverse populations. Our method enables straightforward progression from low-coverage sequence to imputed genotypes, overcoming barriers that at present restrict the application of genome-wide association study technology outside humans."
https://openalex.org/W3164885408,"Microglia, the tissue-resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), play critical roles in immune defense, development and homeostasis. However, isolating microglia from humans in large numbers is challenging. Here, we profiled gene expression variation in primary human microglia isolated from 141 patients undergoing neurosurgery. Using single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing, we identify how age, sex and clinical pathology influence microglia gene expression and which genetic variants have microglia-specific functions using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping. We follow up one of our findings using a human induced pluripotent stem cell-based macrophage model to fine-map a candidate causal variant for Alzheimer’s disease at the BIN1 locus. Our study provides a population-scale transcriptional map of a critically important cell for human CNS development and disease. A population-scale map of gene expression in primary human microglia provides a systematic exploration of microglia diversity and how age, sex, pathology, cortical anatomy and common germline genetic variation influence the microglia transcriptome."

https://openalex.org/W3165387804,"COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness, and smoking adversely impacts the respiratory and immune systems; this confluence may therefore incentivize smokers to quit. The present study, conducted in four high-income countries during the first global wave of COVID-19, examined the association between COVID-19 and: (1) thoughts about quitting smoking; (2) changes in smoking (quit attempt, reduced or increased smoking, or no change); and (3) factors related to a positive change (making a quit attempt or reducing smoking) based on an adapted framework of the Health Belief Model.This cross-sectional study included 6870 adult smokers participating in the Wave 3 (2020) ITC Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey conducted in Australia, Canada, England, and United States (US). These four countries had varying responses to the pandemic by governments and public health, ranging from advising voluntary social distancing to implementing national and subnational staged lockdowns. Considering these varying responses, and the differences in the number of confirmed cases and deaths (greatest in England and the US and lowest in Australia), smoking behaviours related to COVID-19 may have differed between countries. Other factors that may be related to changes in smoking because of COVID-19 were also explored (e.g., sociodemographics, nicotine dependence, perceptions about personal and general risks of smoking on COVID-19). Regression analyses were conducted on weighted data.Overall, 46.7% of smokers reported thinking about quitting because of COVID-19, which differed by country (p<0.001): England highest (50.9%) and Australia lowest (37.6%). Thinking about quitting smoking because of COVID-19 was more frequent among: females, ethnic minorities, those with financial stress, current vapers, less dependent smokers (non-daily and fewer cigarettes smoked/day), those with greater concern about personal susceptibility of infection, and those who believe COVID-19 is more severe for smokers. Smoking behaviour changes due to COVID-19 were: 1.1% attempted to quit, 14.2% reduced smoking, and 14.6% increased smoking (70.2% reported no change). Positive behaviour change (tried to quit/reduced smoking) was reported by 15.5% of smokers, which differed by country (p = 0.02), where Australia had significantly lower rates than the other three countries. A positive behavioural smoking change was more likely among smokers with: lower dependence, greater concern about personal susceptibility to infection, and believing that COVID-19 is more severe for smokers.Though nearly half of smokers reported thinking about quitting because of COVID-19, the vast majority did not change their smoking behaviour. Smokers were more likely to try and quit or reduce their smoking if they had greater concern about susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 related to smoking. Smokers in Australia were least likely to reduce or try to quit smoking, which could be related to the significantly lower impact of COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic relative to the other countries."
https://openalex.org/W4206754124,"Inexpensive genotyping methods are essential to modern genomics. Here we present QUILT, which performs diploid genotype imputation using low-coverage whole-genome sequence data. QUILT employs Gibbs sampling to partition reads into maternal and paternal sets, facilitating rapid haploid imputation using large reference panels. We show this partitioning to be accurate over many megabases, enabling highly accurate imputation close to theoretical limits and outperforming existing methods. Moreover, QUILT can impute accurately using diverse technologies, including long reads from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and a new form of low-cost barcoded Illumina sequencing called haplotagging, with the latter showing improved accuracy at low coverages. Relative to DNA genotyping microarrays, QUILT offers improved accuracy at reduced cost, particularly for diverse populations that are traditionally underserved in modern genomic analyses, with accuracy nearly doubling at rare SNPs. Finally, QUILT can accurately impute (four-digit) human leukocyte antigen types, the first such method from low-coverage sequence data."
https://openalex.org/W3164475072,"Background Dysphagia appears to be common in patients with severe COVID-19. Information about the characteristics of dysphagia and laryngeal findings in COVID-19 patients treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) is still limited. Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate oropharyngeal swallowing function and laryngeal appearance and function in patients with severe COVID-19. Method A series of 25 ICU patients with COVID-19 and signs of dysphagia were examined with fiberendoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) during the latter stage of ICU care or after discharge from the ICU. Swallowing function and laryngeal findings were assessed with standard rating scales from video recordings. Results Pooling of secretions was found in 92% of patients. Eleven patients (44%) showed signs of silent aspiration to the trachea on at least one occasion. All patients showed residue after swallowing to some degree both in the vallecula and hypopharynx. Seventy-six percent of patients had impaired vocal cord movement. Erythema of the vocal folds was found in 60% of patients and edema in the arytenoid region in 60%. Conclusion Impairment of oropharyngeal swallowing function and abnormal laryngeal findings were common in this series of patients with severe COVID-19 treated in the ICU. To avoid complications related to dysphagia in this patient group, it seems to be of great importance to evaluate the swallowing function as a standard procedure, preferably at an early stage, before initiation of oral intake. Fiberendoscopic evaluation of swallowing is preferred due to the high incidence of pooling of secretion in the hypopharynx, silent aspiration, and residuals. Further studies of the impact on swallowing function in short- and long-term in patients with COVID-19 are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3164539925,"The aim of the present investigation was to determine the concentration of heavy metals in the different organs of Pisum sativum L. (garden pea) grown in contaminated soils in comparison to nonpolluted soils in the South Cairo and Giza provinces, Egypt, and their effect on consumers' health. To collect soil and plant samples from two nonpolluted and two polluted farms, five quadrats, each of 1 m2, were collected per each farm and used for growth measurement and chemical analysis. The daily intake of metals (DIM) and its associated health risks (health risk index (HRI) were also assessed. The investigated heavy metals were cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), silver (Ag), cobalt (Co) and vanadium (V). Significant differences in soil heavy metals, except As, between nonpolluted and polluted sites were recorded. Fresh and dry phytomass, photosynthetic pigments, fruit production, and organic and inorganic nutrients were reduced in the polluted sites, where there was a high concentration of heavy metals in the fruit. The bioaccumulation factor for all studied heavy metals exceeded 1 in the polluted sites and only Pb, Cu and Mn exceeded 1 in the nonpolluted sites. Except for Fe, the DIM of the studied heavy metals in both sites did not exceed 1 in either children or adults. However, the HRI of Pb, Cd, Fe, and Mn in the polluted plants and Pb in the nonpolluted ones exceeded 1, indicating significant potential health risks to consumers. The authors recommend not to eat garden peas grown in the polluted sites, and farmers should carefully grow heavy metals non-accumulating food crops or non-edible plants for other purposes such as animal forages."
https://openalex.org/W3165654783,"Context-based sensorimotor routing is a hallmark of executive control. Pharmacological inactivations in rats have implicated the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) in this process. But what specific role is this, and what circuit mechanisms support it? Here we report a subset of rat SC neurons that instantiate a specific link between the representations of context and motor choice. Moreover, these neurons encode animals’ choice far earlier than other neurons in the SC or in the frontal cortex, suggesting that their neural dynamics lead choice computation. Optogenetic inactivations revealed that SC activity during context encoding is necessary for choice behavior, even while that choice behavior is robust to inactivations during choice formation. Searches for SC circuit models matching our experimental results identified key circuit predictions while revealing some a priori expected features as unnecessary. Our results reveal circuit mechanisms within the SC that implement response inhibition and context-based vector inversion during executive control. Duan et al. reveal circuit mechanisms of executive control in the midbrain superior colliculus (SC), where response inhibition and context-based vector inversion are instantiated by specific SC subpopulations."

https://openalex.org/W3163993957,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common autosomal dominant disorder that can result in premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Limited data are available worldwide about the prevalence and management of FH. Here, we aimed to estimate the prevalence and management of patients with FH in five Arabian Gulf countries (Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Bahrain).The multicentre, multinational Gulf FH registry included adults (≥18 years old) recruited from outpatient clinics in 14 tertiary-care centres across five Arabian Gulf countries over the last five years. The Gulf FH registry had four phases: 1- screening, 2- classification based on the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network, 3- genetic testing, and 4- follow-up.Among 34,366 screened patient records, 3713 patients had suspected FH (mean age: 49±15 years; 52% women) and 306 patients had definite or probable FH. Thus, the estimated FH prevalence was 0.9% (1:112). Treatments included high-intensity statin therapy (34%), ezetimibe (10%), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (0.4%). Targets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were achieved by 12% and 30%, respectively, of patients at high ASCVD risk, and by 3% and 6%, respectively, of patients at very high ASCVD risk (p <0.001; for both comparisons).This snap-shot study was the first to show the high estimated prevalence of FH in the Arabian Gulf region (about 3-fold the estimated prevalence worldwide), and is a ""call-to-action"" for further confirmation in future population studies. The small proportions of patients that achieved target LDL-C values implied that health care policies need to implement nation-wide screening, raise FH awareness, and improve management strategies for FH."
https://openalex.org/W3165244265,"Horses have the ability to generate a remarkable repertoire of facial expressions, some of which have been linked to the affective component of pain. This study describes the facial expressions in healthy horses free of pain before and during transportation and social isolation, which are putatively stressful but ordinary management procedures. Transportation was performed in 28 horses by subjecting them to short-term road transport in a horse trailer. A subgroup (n = 10) of these horses was also subjected to short-term social isolation. During all procedures, a body-mounted, remote-controlled heart rate monitor provided continuous heart rate measurements. The horses' heads were video-recorded during the interventions. An exhaustive dataset was generated from the selected video clips of all possible facial action units and action descriptors, time of emergency, duration, and frequency according to the Equine Facial Action Coding System (EquiFACS). Heart rate increased during both interventions (p<0.01), confirming that they caused disruption in sympato-vagal balance. Using the current method for ascribing certain action units (AUs) to specific emotional states in humans and a novel data-driven co-occurrence method, the following facial traits were observed during both interventions: eye white increase (p<0.001), nostril dilator (p<0.001), upper eyelid raiser (p<0.001), inner brow raiser (p = 0.042), tongue show (p<0.001). Increases in 'ear flicker' (p<0.001) and blink frequency (p<0.001) were also seen. These facial actions were used to train a machine-learning classifier to discriminate between the high-arousal interventions and calm horses, which achieved at most 79% accuracy. Most facial features identified correspond well with previous findings on behaviors of stressed horses, for example flared nostrils, repetitive mouth behaviors, increased eye white, tongue show, and ear movements. Several features identified in this study of pain-free horses, such as dilated nostrils, eye white increase, and inner brow raiser, are used as indicators of pain in some face-based pain assessment tools. In order to increase performance parameters in pain assessment tools, the relations between facial expressions of stress and pain should be studied further."
https://openalex.org/W3164398315,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly used to measure biodiversity of marine ecosystems, yet key aspects of the temporal dynamics of eDNA remain unknown. Of particular interest is in situ persistence of eDNA signals in dynamic marine environments, as eDNA degradation rates have predominantly been quantified through mesocosm studies. To determine in situ eDNA residence times, we introduced an eDNA signal from a non-native fish into a protected bay of a Southern California rocky reef ecosystem, and then measured changes in both introduced and background eDNA signals across a fixed transect over 96 hours. Foreign eDNA signal was no longer detected only 7.5 hours after introduction, a time substantially shorter than the multi-day persistence times in laboratory studies. Moreover, the foreign eDNA signal spread along the entire 38 m transect within 1.5 hours after introduction, indicating that transport and diffusion play a role in eDNA detectability even in protected low energy marine environments. Similarly, native vertebrate eDNA signals varied greatly over the 96 hours of observation as well as within two additional nearby fixed transects sampled over 120 hours. While community structure did significantly change across time of day and tidal direction, neither accounted for the majority of observed variation. Combined, results show that both foreign and native eDNA signatures can exhibit substantial temporal heterogeneity, even on hourly time scales. Further work exploring eDNA decay from lagrangian perspective and quantifying effects of sample and technical replication are needed to better understand temporal variation of eDNA signatures in nearshore marine environments."
https://openalex.org/W3163968156,"Around 5% of the population is affected by a rare genetic disease, yet most endure years of uncertainty before receiving a genetic test. A common feature of genetic diseases is the presence of multiple rare phenotypes that often span organ systems. Here, we use diagnostic billing information from longitudinal clinical data in the electronic health records (EHRs) of 2,286 patients who received a chromosomal microarray test, and 9,144 matched controls, to build a model to predict who should receive a genetic test. The model achieved high prediction accuracies in a held-out test sample (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), 0.97; area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), 0.92), in an independent hospital system (AUROC, 0.95; AUPRC, 0.62), and in an independent set of 172,265 patients in which cases were broadly defined as having an interaction with a genetics provider (AUROC, 0.9; AUPRC, 0.63). Patients carrying a putative pathogenic copy number variant were also accurately identified by the model. Compared with current approaches for genetic test determination, our model could identify more patients for testing while also increasing the proportion of those tested who have a genetic disease. We demonstrate that phenotypic patterns representative of a wide range of genetic diseases can be captured from EHRs to systematize decision-making for genetic testing, with the potential to speed up diagnosis, improve care and reduce costs."
https://openalex.org/W3164720091,"In boar sperm, we have previously shown that capacitation is associated with the appearance of the p32 tyrosine phosphoprotein complex. The principal tyrosine phosphoprotein involved in this complex is the acrosin-binding protein (ACRBP), which regulates the autoconversion of proacrosin to intermediate forms of acrosin in both boar and mouse sperm. However, the complete biological role of ACRBP has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that tyrosine phophorylation and the presence of the ACRBP in the sperm head are largely necessary to induce capacitation, the acrosome reaction (AR) and sperm-zona pellucida (ZP) binding, all of which are necessary steps for fertilization. In vitro fertilization (IVF) was performed using matured porcine oocytes and pre-capacitated boar sperm cultured with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies or antibodies against ACRBP. Anti-ACRBP antibodies reduced capacitation and spontaneous AR (P<0.05). Sperm-ZP binding declined in the presence of anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-ACRBP antibodies. The localisation of anti-ACRBP antibodies on the sperm head, reduced the ability of the sperm to undergo the AR in response to solubilized ZP or by inhibiting the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. These results support our hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylated proteins and ACRBP are present upon the sperm surface in order to participate in sperm-ZP binding, and that ACRBP upon the surface of the sperm head facilitates capacitation and the AR in the porcine."
https://openalex.org/W3165146346,"Females of many vertebrate species have the capacity to store sperm within their reproductive tracts for prolonged periods of time. Termed long-term sperm storage, this phenomenon has many important physiological, ecological, and evolutionary implications, particularly to the study of mating systems, including male reproductive success and post-copulatory sexual selection. Reptiles appear particularly predisposed to long-term sperm storage, with records in most major lineages, with a strong emphasis on turtles and squamates (lizards, snakes, but not the amphisbaenians). Because facultative parthenogenesis is a competing hypothesis to explain the production of offspring after prolonged separation from males, the identification of paternal alleles through genetic analysis is essential. However, few studies in snakes have undertaken this. Here, we report on a wild-collected female Western Diamond-backed Rattlesnake, Crotalus atrox, maintained in isolation from the time of capture in September 1999, that produced two healthy litters approximately one and six years post capture. Genetic analysis of the 2005 litter, identified paternal contribution in all offspring, thus rejecting facultative parthenogenesis. We conclude that the duration of long-term sperm storage was approximately 6 years (71 months), making this the longest period over which a female vertebrate has been shown to store sperm that resulted in the production of healthy offspring."
https://openalex.org/W3164139186,"Despite advances in three-dimensional (3D) imaging, it remains challenging to profile all the cells within a large 3D tissue, including the morphology and organization of the many cell types present. Here, we introduce eight-color, multispectral, large-scale single-cell resolution 3D (mLSR-3D) imaging and image analysis software for the parallelized, deep learning-based segmentation of large numbers of single cells in tissues, called segmentation analysis by parallelization of 3D datasets (STAPL-3D). Applying the method to pediatric Wilms tumor, we extract molecular, spatial and morphological features of millions of cells and reconstruct the tumor's spatio-phenotypic patterning. In situ population profiling and pseudotime ordering reveals a highly disorganized spatial pattern in Wilms tumor compared to healthy fetal kidney, yet cellular profiles closely resembling human fetal kidney cells could be observed. In addition, we identify previously unreported tumor-specific populations, uniquely characterized by their spatial embedding or morphological attributes. Our results demonstrate the use of combining mLSR-3D and STAPL-3D to generate a comprehensive cellular map of human tumors."

The two groups of subjects were initially categorized based on a range of clinical tests including measurements of intraocular pressure, visual fields, oct derived retinal nerve fiber layer (rnfl) thickness and dilated stereoscopic examination of onh. 227 slo images of 227 subjects (105 glaucoma patients and 122 controls) were used. A new task-specific convolutional neural network architecture was developed for slo image-based classification. To benchmark the results of the proposed method, a range of classifiers were tested including five machine learning methods to classify glaucoma based on rnfl thickness-a well-known biomarker in glaucoma diagnostics, ensemble classifier based on inception v3 architecture, and classifiers based on features extracted from the image. The study shows that cross-validation dl ensemble based on slo images achieved a good discrimination performance with up to 0.962 of balanced accuracy, outperforming all of the other tested classifiers."

PWIDs at high risk for non-adherence to DAA therapy (n = 122) received HCV treatment alongside OAT under the supervision of medical staff (""directly observed therapy"", DOT). These patients were compared to patients with presumed excellent drug compliance, who were treated in a ""standard setting"" (SS) of SOF/VEL prescription at a tertiary care center (n = 99).DOT-patients (n = 122/221; 55.2%) were younger than SS-patients (median age: 41.3 vs. 53.0 years), all had psychiatric comorbidities and most had a poor socioeconomic status. 83/122 (68.0%) reported ongoing intravenous drug use. Within the DOT-group, SVR12 was achieved in 99.1% (95% CI: 95.0-100; n = 109/110) with one patient experiencing treatment failure, while n = 12/122 (9.8%) patients were excluded due to loss of follow-up (FU). 5 patients showed HCV reinfection after achieving SVR12. SS-patients achieved SVR in 96.6% (95% CI: 90.3-99.3%; n = 84/87) after exclusion of 10/99 (10.1%) patients who were lost to FU and 2 patients who died prior to SVR12 due to reasons not related to DAA therapy.SOF/VEL given as DOT along with OAT in PWIDs at high risk of non-adherence to antiviral therapy including those with ongoing intravenous drug use resulted in excellent SVR rates similar to patients with presumed ""excellent compliance"" under standard drug intake."
https://openalex.org/W3165665944,"Regular exercise maintains arterial endothelial cell homeostasis and protects the arteries from vascular disease, such as peripheral artery disease and atherosclerosis. Autophagy, which is a cellular process that degrades misfolded or aggregate proteins and damaged organelles, plays an important role in maintaining organ and cellular homeostasis. However, it is unknown whether regular exercise stimulates autophagy in aorta endothelial cells of mice prone to atherosclerosis independently of their circulating lipid profile. Here, we observed that 16 weeks of voluntary exercise reduced high-fat diet-induced atherosclerotic plaque formation in the aortic root of ApoE deficient mice, and that this protection occurred without changes in circulating triglycerides, total cholesterol, and lipoproteins. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that voluntary exercise increased levels of the autophagy protein LC3 in aortic endothelial cells. Interestingly, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to serum from voluntarily exercised mice displayed significantly increased LC3-I and LC3-II protein levels. Analysis of circulating cytokines demonstrated that voluntary exercise caused changes directly relevant to IL-1 signaling (ie, decreased interleukin-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1ra] while also increasing IL-1α). HUVECs exposed to IL-1α and IL-1β recombinant protein significantly increased LC3 mRNA expression, LC3-I and LC3-II protein levels, and autophagy flux. Collectively, these results suggest that regular exercise protects arteries from ApoE deficient mice against atherosclerosis at least in part by stimulating endothelial cell autophagy via enhanced IL-1 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3164432804,"Physiological circadian rhythms (CRs) are complex processes with 24-hour oscillations that regulate diverse biological functions. Chronic weekly light/dark (LD) shifting (CR disruption; CRD) in mice results in colonic hyperpermeability. However, the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are incompletely understood. One potential innovative in vitro method to study colonic CRs are colon organoids. The goals of this study were to utilize circadian clock gene Per2 luciferase reporter (Per2::Luc) mice to measure the effects of chronic LD shifting on colonic tissue circadian rhythmicity ex vivo and to determine if organoids made from shifted mice colons recapitulate the in vivo phenotype.Non-shifted (NS) and shifted (S) BL6 Per2::Luc mice were compared after a 22-week experiment. NS mice had a standard 12h light/12h dark LD cycle throughout. S mice alternated 12h LD patterns weekly, with light from 6am-6pm one week followed by shifting light to 6pm-6am the next week for 22 weeks. Mice were tested for intestinal permeability while colon tissue and organoids were examined for CRs of bioluminescence and proteins of barrier function and cell fate.There was no absolute difference in NS vs. S 24h circadian period or phase. However, chronic LD shifting caused Per2::Luc S mice colon tissue to exhibit significantly greater variability in both the period and phase of Per2::Luc rhythms than NS mice colon tissue and organoids. Chronic LD shifting also resulted in increased colonic permeability of the Per2::Luc mice as well as decreased protein markers of intestinal permeability in colonic tissue and organoids from shifted Per2:Luc mice.Our studies support a model in which chronic central circadian disruption by LD shifting alters the circadian phenotype of the colon tissue and results in colon leakiness and loss of colonic barrier function. These CRD-related changes are stably expressed in colon stem cell derived organoids from CRD mice."

Objective To estimate the prevalence of TB among the tribal populations in India. Design, participants, setting A survey using a multistage cluster sampling design was conducted between April 2015 and March 2020 covering 88 villages (clusters) from districts with over 70% tribal majority populations in 17 States across 6 zones of India. The sample populations included individuals ≥15 years old. Main outcome and measures Eligible participants who were screened through an interview for symptoms suggestive of pulmonary TB (PTB); Two sputum specimens were examined by smear and culture. Prevalence was estimated after multiple imputations for non-coverage and a correction factor of 1.31 was then applied to account for non-inclusion of X-ray screening. Results A total of 74532 (81.0%) of the 92038 eligible individuals were screened; 2675 (3.6%) were found to have TB symptoms or h/o ATT. The overall prevalence of PTB was 432 per 100,000 populations. The PTB prevalence per 100,000 populations was highest 625 [95% CI: 496–754] in the central zone and least 153 [95% CI: 24–281] in the west zone. Among the 17 states that were covered in this study, Odisha recorded the highest prevalence of 803 [95% CI: 504–1101] and Jammu and Kashmir the lowest 127 [95% CI: 0–310] per 100,000 populations. Findings from multiple logistic regression analysis reflected that those aged 35 years and above, with BMI &lt;18.5 Kgs /m 2 , h/o ATT, smoking, and/or consuming alcohol had a higher risk of bacteriologically positive PTB. Weight loss was relatively more important symptom associated with tuberculosis among this tribal populations followed by night sweats, blood in sputum, and fever. Conclusion and relevance The overall prevalence of PTB among tribal groups is higher than the general populations with a wide variation of prevalence of PTB among the tribal groups at zone and state levels. These findings call for strengthening of the TB control efforts in tribal areas to reduce TB prevalence through tribal community/site-specific intervention programs."

Recent studies have indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can serve as an independent biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in many types of cancer, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, liver cancer, and lung cancer. Previous studies have shown that many lncRNAs are associated with the occurrence and development of BCa. However, few studies have combined multiple lncRNAs to predict the prognosis of early-stage BCa patients. Methods Systematic and comprehensive analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was conducted to identify lncRNA signatures with prognostic value in BCa. Additionally, the relative expression levels of the 8 lncRNA of several BCa cell lines were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and the results were substituted into a risk score formula. Finally, migration assays were used to verify the result from prognostic analysis according to the risk scores among cell lines with different risk scores. Results Our study included 808 BCa patients with complete clinical data. A panel of 8 lncRNAs was identified using Wilcox tests as different between normal and tumor tissue of the BCa patients. This panel was used to analyze the survival of BCa patients. Patients with low risk scores had greater overall survival (OS) than those with high risk scores. Multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that the lncRNA signature was an independent prognostic factor. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) suggested that the lncRNAs might be involved in several molecular signaling pathways implicated in BCa such as the DNA replication pathway, the cell cycle pathway, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Validation experiments in breast cancer cells to test cell migration by using wound-healing assays supported the results of the model. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that a panel of 8 lncRNAs has the potential to be used as an independent prognostic biomarker of BCa."
https://openalex.org/W3164049161,"A remarkable feature of the microtubule cytoskeleton is the coexistence of subpopulations having different dynamic properties. A prominent example is the anaphase spindle, where stable antiparallel bundles exist alongside dynamic microtubules and provide spatial cues for cytokinesis. How are the dynamics of spatially proximal arrays differentially regulated? We reconstitute a minimal system of three midzone proteins: microtubule-crosslinker PRC1 and its interactors CLASP1 and Kif4A, proteins that promote and suppress microtubule elongation, respectively. We find that their collective activity promotes elongation of single microtubules while simultaneously stalling polymerization of crosslinked bundles. This differentiation arises from (1) strong rescue activity of CLASP1, which overcomes the weaker effects of Kif4A on single microtubules, and (2) lower microtubule- and PRC1-binding affinity of CLASP1, which permits the dominance of Kif4A at overlaps. In addition to canonical mechanisms where antagonistic regulators set microtubule length, our findings illuminate design principles by which collective regulator activity creates microenvironments of arrays with distinct dynamic properties."
https://openalex.org/W3164899060,"Trpm8 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 8) is expressed by sensory neurons and is involved in the detection of environmental cold temperatures. TRPM8 activity triggers an increase in uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1)-dependent brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis. Bone density and marrow adipose tissue are both influenced by rodent housing temperature and brown adipose tissue, but it is unknown if TRPM8 is involved in the co-regulation of thermogenesis and bone homeostasis. To address this, we examined the bone phenotypes of one-year-old Trpm8 knockout mice (Trpm8-KO) after a 4-week cold temperature challenge. Male Trpm8-KO mice had lower bone mineral density than WT, with smaller bone size (femur length and cross-sectional area) being the most striking finding, and exhibited a delayed cold acclimation with increased BAT expression of Dio2 and Cidea compared to WT. In contrast to males, female Trpm8-KO mice had low vertebral bone microarchitectural parameters, but no genotype-specific alterations in body temperature. Interestingly, Trpm8 was not required for cold-induced trabecular bone loss in either sex, but bone marrow adipose tissue in females was significantly suppressed by Trpm8 deletion. In summary, we identified sex differences in the role of TRPM8 in maintaining body temperature, bone microarchitecture and marrow adipose tissue. Identifying mechanisms through which cold temperature and BAT influence bone could help to ameliorate potential bone side effects of obesity treatments designed to stimulate thermogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3164923360,"Many studies have characterized class A GPCRs in crustaceans; however, their expression in crustacean chemosensory organs has yet to be detailed. Class A GPCRs comprise several subclasses mediating diverse functions. In this study, using sequence homology, we classified all putative class A GPCRs in two chemosensory organs (antennular lateral flagellum [LF] and walking leg dactyls) and brain of four species of decapod crustaceans (Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus , American lobster Homarus americanus , red-swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii , and blue crab Callinectes sapidus ). We identified 333 putative class A GPCRs– 83 from P . argus , 81 from H . americanus , 102 from P . clarkii , and 67 from C . sapidus– which belong to five distinct subclasses. The numbers of sequences for each subclass in the four decapod species are (in parentheses): opsins (19), small-molecule receptors including biogenic amine receptors (83), neuropeptide receptors (90), leucine-rich repeat-containing GPCRs (LGRs) (24), orphan receptors (117). Most class A GPCRs are predominately expressed in the brain; however, we identified multiple transcripts enriched in the LF and several in the dactyl. In total, we found 55 sequences with higher expression in the chemosensory organs relative to the brain across three decapod species. We also identified novel transcripts enriched in the LF including a metabotropic histamine receptor and numerous orphan receptors. Our work establishes expression patterns for class A GPCRs in the chemosensory organs of crustaceans, providing insight into molecular mechanisms mediating neurotransmission, neuromodulation, and possibly chemoreception."
https://openalex.org/W3165424066,"The Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor is one of the most important trophic proteins in the brain. The role of this growth factor in neuronal plasticity, in health and disease, has been extensively studied. However, mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of Bdnf gene expression in epilepsy are still elusive. In our previous work, using a rat model of neuronal activation upon kainate-induced seizures, we observed a repositioning of Bdnf alleles from the nuclear periphery towards the nuclear center. This change of Bdnf intranuclear position was associated with transcriptional gene activity. In the present study, using the same neuronal activation model, we analyzed the relation between the percentage of the Bdnf allele at the nuclear periphery and clinical and morphological traits of epilepsy. We observed that the decrease of the percentage of the Bdnf allele at the nuclear periphery correlates with stronger mossy fiber sprouting-an aberrant form of excitatory circuits formation. Moreover, using in vitro hippocampal cultures we showed that Bdnf repositioning is a consequence of transcriptional activity. Inhibition of RNA polymerase II activity in primary cultured neurons with Actinomycin D completely blocked Bdnf gene transcription and repositioning occurring after neuronal excitation. Interestingly, we observed that histone deacetylases inhibition with Trichostatin A induced a slight increase of Bdnf gene transcription and its repositioning even in the absence of neuronal excitation. Presented results provide novel insight into the role of BDNF in epileptogenesis. Moreover, they strengthen the statement that this particular gene is a good candidate to search for a new generation of antiepileptic therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3164666511,"Despite the importance of pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the progression of GDM to type 2 diabetes, few studies have evaluated the combined effect of high pre-pregnancy BMI and GDM status on the future development of type 2 diabetes in Korean women. This study aimed to examine the relationship of pre-pregnancy BMI and GDM history with the risk of type 2 diabetes among Korean women. In addition, the effects of pre-pregnancy BMI and current BMI on the risk of type 2 diabetes were evaluated. Women who gave birth in the Health Examinees Study of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study from 2004 to 2013 (n = 59,258) were included in this study. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association of pre-pregnancy BMI categories (underweight: <18.5 kg/m2; normal: 18.5-22.9 kg/m2; overweight: 23.0-24.9 kg/m2; obese: ≥25.0 kg/m2) and GDM history with the risk of type 2 diabetes after controlling for the following covariates: age, education, income, smoking status before the first pregnancy, alcohol consumption, regular exercise, menarche age, first pregnancy age, and first pregnancy outcome. Compared to women with normal pre-pregnancy BMIs, women with overweight and obese pre-pregnancy BMIs had higher odds of developing type 2 diabetes (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.25 and AOR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.10-1.50, respectively) after controlling for covariates. Women with pre-pregnancy BMIs <23 kg/m2 and current BMIs ≥23 kg/m2 had increased odds of developing type 2 diabetes (AOR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.51-1.78) compared to those with pre-pregnancy BMIs <23 kg/m2 and current BMIs <23 kg/m2. Among women without a history of GDM, those with overweight and obese pre-pregnancy BMIs had increased odds of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with normal pre-pregnancy BMIs (AOR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01-1.24 and AOR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.05-1.44, respectively). Among women with GDM, those with obese pre-pregnancy BMIs had increased odds of developing type 2 diabetes (AOR: 3.84, 95% CI: 1.52-9.87). This study showed that there was a higher likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes in women who were overweight or obese before pregnancy with a history of GDM compared to their counterparts without a history of GDM. Furthermore, high pre-pregnancy BMI or high current BMI increased the risk of type 2 diabetes in Korean women, regardless of GDM history. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy weight status before and after pregnancy to prevent the future risk of type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3164853650,"This study shows that while status seeking motivates people to participate in crowdsourcing platforms, it also negatively impacts the bedrock of crowdsourcing-wisdom of crowds. Using Yelp restaurant reviews in 6 cities, we found that motivations of status seeking lead people to review a greater variety of restaurants, and achieving status further encourages this variety seeking as well as the targeting of more expensive restaurants for review. The impact of this individual-level tendency is confirmed by our aggregate-level analysis which shows that restaurants with higher price levels, higher uniqueness levels, and a larger percentage of elite reviews tend to obtain enough reviews to generate wisdom of crowds sooner than other restaurants. This leads to a different kind of distortion to crowd wisdom: an over-representation of status-conferring products and an under-representation of products that are not status-worthy. The findings suggest the importance of studying sources of distortion that are endemic to crowdsourcing itself."
https://openalex.org/W3165370574,"Leucine zipper-EF-hand containing transmembrane protein 1 (Letm1) is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein involved in Ca2+ and K+ homeostasis in mammalian cells. Here, we demonstrate that the Letm1 orthologue of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, is important for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release. The results show that both mitochondrial Ca2+ influx and efflux are reduced in TcLetm1 knockdown (TcLetm1-KD) cells and increased in TcLetm1 overexpressing cells, without alterations in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Remarkably, TcLetm1 knockdown or overexpression increases or does not affect mitochondrial Ca2+ levels in epimastigotes, respectively. TcLetm1-KD epimastigotes have reduced growth, and both overexpression and knockdown of TcLetm1 cause a defect in metacyclogenesis. TcLetm1-KD also affected mitochondrial bioenergetics. Invasion of host cells by TcLetm1-KD trypomastigotes and their intracellular replication is greatly impaired. Taken together, our findings indicate that TcLetm1 is important for Ca2+ homeostasis and cell viability in T cruzi."
https://openalex.org/W3164115778,"Knockout of the chloride channel protein 2 (CLC-2; CLCN2) results in fast progressing blindness in mice. Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptors undergo, in parallel, rapid, and profound morphological changes and degeneration. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy of the outer retina and electroretinography of the CLC-2 KO mouse demonstrated normal morphology at postnatal day 2, followed by drastic changes in RPE and photoreceptor morphology and loss of vision during the first postnatal month. To investigate whether the RPE or the photoreceptors are the primary cause of the degeneration, we injected lentiviruses carrying HA-tagged CLC-2 with an RPE-specific promotor in the subretinal space of CLC-2-KO mice at the time of eye opening. As expected, CLC-2-HA was expressed exclusively in RPE; strikingly, this procedure rescued the degeneration of both RPE and photoreceptors. Light response in transduced eyes was also recovered. Only a fraction of RPE was transduced with the lentivirus; however, the entire RPE monolayer appears healthy, even the RPE cells not expressing the CLC-2-HA. Surprisingly, in contrast with previous physiological observations that postulate that CLC-2 has a basolateral localization in RPE, our immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated CLC-2 has an apical distribution, facing the subretinal space and the photoreceptor outer segments. Our findings suggest that CLC-2 does not play the postulated role in fluid transport at the basolateral membrane. Rather, they suggest that CLC-2 performs a critical homeostatic role in the subretinal compartment involving a chloride regulatory mechanism that is critical for the survival of both RPE and photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W3164551694,"The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) has been considered the most effective way to avoid the contamination of healthcare workers by different microorganisms, including SARS-CoV-2. A spray disinfection technology (chamber) was developed, and its efficacy in instant decontamination of previously contaminated surfaces was evaluated in two exposure times. Seven test microorganisms were prepared and inoculated on the surface of seven types of PPE (respirator mask, face shield, shoe, glove, cap, safety glasses and lab coat). The tests were performed on previously contaminated PPE using a manikin with a motion device for exposure to the chamber with biocidal agent (sodium hypochlorite) for 10 and 30s. In 96.93% of the experimental conditions analyzed, the percentage reduction was &gt;99% (the number of viable cells found on the surface ranged from 4.3x10 6 to &lt;10 CFU/mL). The samples of E . faecalis collected from the glove showed the lowest percentages reduction, with 86.000 and 86.500% for exposure times of 10 and 30 s, respectively. The log 10 reduction values varied between 0.85 log 10 ( E . faecalis at 30 s in glove surface) and 9.69 log 10 ( E . coli at 10 and 30 s in lab coat surface). In general, E . coli , S . aureus , C . freundii , P . mirabilis , C . albicans and C . parapsilosis showed susceptibility to the biocidal agent under the tested conditions, with &gt;99% reduction after 10 and 30s, while E . faecalis and P . aeruginosa showed a lower susceptibility. The 30s exposure time was more effective for the inactivation of the tested microorganisms. The results show that the spray disinfection technology has the potential for instant decontamination of PPE, which can contribute to an additional barrier for infection control of healthcare workers in the hospital environment."
https://openalex.org/W3163988365,"A diverse range of monocot and dicot grains and their by-products are commonly used in the animal feed industry. They all come with complex and variable cell wall structures which in turn contribute significant fiber to the complete feed. The cell wall is a highly interconnected matrix of various polysaccharides, proteins and lignin and, as such, requires a collaborative effort of different enzymes for its degradation. In this regard, we investigated the potential of a commercial multicomponent carbohydrase product from a wild type fermentation of Trichoderma reesei (T. reesei) (RONOZYME® MultiGrain) in degrading cell wall components of wheat, barley, rye, de-oiled rice bran, sunflower, rapeseed and cassava. A total of thirty-one different enzyme proteins were identified in the T. Reesei carbohydrase product using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS including glycosyl hydrolases and carbohydrate esterases. As measured by in vitro incubations and non-starch polysaccharide component analysis, and visualization by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy imaging of immuno-labeled samples with confocal microscopy, the carbohydrase product effectively solubilized cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic polysaccharides present in the cell walls of all the feed ingredients evaluated. The T. reesei fermentation also decreased viscosity of arabinoxylan, xyloglucan, galactomannan and β-glucan substrates. Combination of several debranching enzymes including arabinofuranosidase, xylosidase, α-galactosidase, acetyl xylan esterase, and 4-O-methyl-glucuronoyl methylesterase with both GH10 and GH11 xylanases in the carbohydrase product resulted in effective hydrolyzation of heavily branched glucuronoarabinoxylans. The different β-glucanases (both endo-β-1,3(4)-glucanase and endo-β-1,3-glucanase), cellulases and a β-glucosidase in the T. reesei fermentation effectively reduced polymerization of both β-glucans and cellulose polysaccharides of viscous cereals grains (wheat, barley, rye and oat). Interestingly, the secretome of T. reesei contained significant amounts of an exceptional direct chain-cutting enzyme from the GH74 family (Cel74A, xyloglucan-specific β-1,4-endoglucanase), that strictly cleaves the xyloglucan backbone at the substituted regions. Here, we demonstrated that the balance of enzymes present in the T. reesei secretome is capable of degrading various cell wall components in both monocot and dicot plant raw material used as animal feed."
https://openalex.org/W3164279235,"Diapause is a reversible developmental arrest faced by many organisms in harsh environments. Annual killifish present this mechanism in three possible stages of development. Killifish are freshwater teleosts from Africa and America that live in ephemeral ponds, which dry up in the dry season. The juvenile and adult populations die, and the embryos remain buried in the bottom mud until the next rainy season. Thus, species survival is entirely embryo-dependent, and they are perhaps the most remarkable extremophile organisms among vertebrates. The aim of the present study was to gather information about embryonic diapauses with the use of a “shotgun” proteomics approach in diapause III and prehatching Austrolebias charrua embryos. Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of diapause III. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD025196. We detected a diapause-dependent change in a large group of proteins involved in different functions, such as metabolic pathways and stress tolerance, as well as proteins related to DNA repair and epigenetic modifications. Furthermore, we observed a diapause-associated switch in cytoskeletal proteins. This first glance into global protein expression differences between prehatching and diapause III could provide clues regarding the induction/maintenance of this developmental arrest in A . charrua embryos. There appears to be no single mechanism underlying diapause and the present data expand our knowledge of the molecular basis of diapause regulation. This information will be useful for future comparative approaches among different diapauses in annual killifish and/or other organisms that experience developmental arrest."
https://openalex.org/W3164506023,"Plasma biochemistry and hematology reference intervals are integral health assessment tools in all medical fields, including aquatic animal health. As sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) are becoming aquaculturally and economically more important, this manuscript provides essential reference intervals (RI) for their plasma biochemistry and hematology along with reference photomicrographs of blood cells in healthy, fasted sablefish. Blood cell morphology can differ between fish species. In addition, blood cell counts and blood chemistry can vary between fish species, demographics, water conditions, seasons, diets, and culture systems, which precludes the use of RI's from other fish species. For this study, blood was collected for plasma biochemistry and hematology analysis between June 20 and July 18, 2019, from healthy, yearling sablefish, hatched and reared in captivity on a commercial diet. Overnight fast of 16-18 hours did not sufficiently reduce lipids in the blood, which led to visible lipemia and frequent rupture of blood cells during analysis. Therefore, sablefish should be fasted for 24 to 36 hours before blood is collected to reduce hematology artifacts or possible reagent interference in plasma biochemistry analysis. Lymphocytes were the most dominant leukocytes (98%), while eosinophils were rare, and basophils were not detected in sablefish. Neutrophils were very large cells with Döhle bodies. In mammals and avian species, Döhle bodies are usually signs of toxic change from inflammation, but no such association was found in these fish. In conclusion, lipemia can interfere with sablefish blood analysis, and available removal methods should be evaluated as fasting for up to 36 h might not always be feasible. Also, more studies are required to establish RI for different developmental stages and rearing conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3164764048,"Coarse woody debris (CWD) is an important component in forests, hosting a variety of organisms that have critical roles in nutrient cycling and carbon (C) storage. We developed a process-based model using literature, field observations, and expert knowledge to assess woody debris decomposition in forests and the movement of wood C into the soil and atmosphere. The sensitivity analysis was conducted against the primary ecological drivers (wood properties and ambient conditions) used as model inputs. The analysis used eighty-nine climate datasets from North America, from tropical (14.2° N) to boreal (65.0° N) zones, with large ranges in annual mean temperature (26.5°C in tropical to -11.8°C in boreal), annual precipitation (6,143 to 181 mm), annual snowfall (0 to 612 kg m-2), and altitude (3 to 2,824 m above mean see level). The sensitivity analysis showed that CWD decomposition was strongly affected by climate, geographical location and altitude, which together regulate the activity of both microbial and invertebrate wood-decomposers. CWD decomposition rate increased with increments in temperature and precipitation, but decreased with increases in latitude and altitude. CWD decomposition was also sensitive to wood size, density, position (standing vs downed), and tree species. The sensitivity analysis showed that fungi are the most important decomposers of woody debris, accounting for over 50% mass loss in nearly all climatic zones in North America. The model includes invertebrate decomposers, focusing mostly on termites, which can have an important role in CWD decomposition in tropical and some subtropical regions. The role of termites in woody debris decomposition varied widely, between 0 and 40%, from temperate areas to tropical regions. Woody debris decomposition rates simulated for eighty-nine locations in North America were within the published range of woody debris decomposition rates for regions in northern hemisphere from 1.6° N to 68.3° N and in Australia."

Risk factors for outbreaks include the emergence of new genotypes and serotype shifting.To understand the genomic and viral characteristics of DENV-infected patients, we conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study among pediatric patients admitted at the 550-bedded Mandalay Children Hospital during the 2018 DEN endemic season. We conducted virus isolation, serological tests, viremia level measurement, and whole-genome sequencing. Among the 202 serum samples, we detected 85 samples with DENV (46 DENV-1, 10 DENV-3, 26 DENV-4 and three multiple serotype co-infections) via reverse transcription quantitative/real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), and we obtained 49 DENV isolates (31 DENV-1, 10 DENV-3 and 8 DEN-4). We did not detect DENV-2 in this study. The viral genome levels in serum did not differ significantly among virus serotypes, infection status (primary versus secondary) and disease severity. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, we identified DENV-1 genotype-1, DENV-4 genotype-1 and DENV-3 genotype-3 and genotype-1 which was detected for the first time. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed greater frequencies of nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations per gene in the nonstructural genes. Moreover, mutation rates were also higher among DENV-1.In conclusion, there was an increasing trend of DENV-3 cases during DENV endemic season in 2018 with the first detection of the genotype 1. However, DENV-1 has remained the predominant serotype in this study area since 2013, and we identified stop codon mutations in the DENV-1 genome. This report is the first to feature a complete genome analysis of the strains of DENV-3 and DENV-4 circulating among pediatric patients in Myanmar. This study highlighted the importance of annual surveillance for a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of DENVs."
https://openalex.org/W3164503758,"Quantification of endogenous biomarkers in clinical studies requires careful evaluation of a number of assay performance parameters. Comparisons of absolute values from several clinical studies can enable retrospective analyses further elucidating the biology of a given biomarker across various study populations. We characterized the performance of a highly multiplex bioanalytical method for quantification of phosphatidylinositols (PI). Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) were employed for targeted multiplex quantification. Odd-chain PI species that are not normally present in human plasma were utilized as surrogate analytes (SA) to assess various assay performance parameters and establish a definitive dynamic linear range for PI lipids. To correct for batch effects, Systematic Error Removal using Random Forest (SERRF) normalization algorithm was employed and used to bridge raw values between two clinical studies, enabling quantitative comparison of their absolute values. A high throughput method was developed, qualified, transferred to an automation platform and applied to sample testing in two clinical trials in healthy volunteers (NCT03001297) and stable Coronary Artery Disease (CAD, NCT03351738) subjects. The method demonstrated acceptable precision and accuracy (±30%) over linear range of 1-1000 nM for SA and 8-fold dilutional linearity for endogenous PI. We determined that mean-adjusted average QC performed best for normalization using SERRF. The comparison of two studies revealed that healthy subject levels of PI are consistently higher across PI species compared to CAD subjects identifying a potential lipid biomarker to be explored in future studies."

Infection in pregnant women can cause severe conditions for their babies. Until now, there is no data regarding Toxoplasma infection from Makassar pregnant mothers. This study aims to obtain information on Toxoplasma specific antibodies and to measure the risk factor associate with parasite infection. This cross-sectional study conducted in 9 of 47 primary health centres (Puskesmas) in Makassar. Blood samples and questionnaires were collected from 184 pregnant women aged 15-42 years old from September to October 2020. ELISA technique was used to examine the IgG and IgM antibodies. Univariable and multivariable analyses were carried out to measure factors that independently associate with Toxoplasma antibody positivity. Our result showed the range of Toxoplasma IgM and IgG are 0.06-1.01 and 0.09-3.01, respectively. While no one of our participants has an acute Toxoplasma gondii infection (IgM positive), we found 32,6% pregnant mothers are exposed to parasite (positive IgG). Contact with cats [OR(95%CI): 10.45(3.77-28.99)], consume chicken satay [OR(95%CI): 9.72(3.71-25.48)] and consume un-boiled water/ filtered water [OR(95%CI): 5.98(1.77-20.23)] are independently associate with positive Toxoplasma IgG antibody.

https://openalex.org/W3165350418,"Many environmental organizations use photographic images to engage donors and supporters. While images play a role in fundraising, visual framing remains understudied in the environmental field. Few real-world experiments have examined which types of images result in higher donations to biodiversity conservation. We examined the role of images in conservation fundraising through a public experiment at Zoomarine, a marine park located in southern Portugal. Zoomarine runs a program called Dolphin Emotions where visitors pay to learn about dolphin biology and to interact with dolphins. We placed a donation box and a large informational poster about the Marine Megafauna Foundation, a conservation partner, in the lounge of the Dolphin Emotions program, which is open to participants and their families. The text on the poster, which solicited donations for the Marine Megafauna Foundation, was held constant, while four different image conditions were tested: dolphins, ocean wildlife, children, and people staring out from the poster (i.e., ""watching eyes""). Each image condition was displayed for three days at a time and was on display for at least seven randomly assigned three-day periods over the course of 91 days. 20,944 visitors passed the donation box and the four poster conditions during this time and a total of € 952.40 was collected. The differences in mean donations in € per visitor per 3-day period were not statistically significant, F(3, 25) = 0.745, p = 0.54. Thus, we did not find that different images had a significant influence on donations to conservation. This may be due to our choice of visual frames or to the use of a donation box, which is a passive fundraising channel. Future research should examine how visual framing influences donations in other public settings and should test the influence of other visual frames on philanthropic behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3165475032,"Objective One of the main problems of lung transplantation is the shortage of organs as well as reduced survival rates. In the absence of an international standardized model for lung donor-recipient allocation, we set out to develop such a model based on the characteristics of past experiences with lung donors and recipients with the aim of improving the outcomes of the entire transplantation process. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of 404 lung transplants carried out at the Reina Sofía University Hospital (Córdoba, Spain) over 23 years. We analyzed various clinical variables obtained via our experience of clinical practice in the donation and transplantation process. These were used to create various classification models, including classical statistical methods and also incorporating newer machine-learning approaches. Results The proposed model represents a powerful tool for donor-recipient matching, which in this current work, exceeded the capacity of classical statistical methods. The variables that predicted an increase in the probability of survival were: higher pre-transplant and post-transplant functional vital capacity (FVC), lower pre-transplant carbon dioxide (PCO2) pressure, lower donor mechanical ventilation, and shorter ischemia time. The variables that negatively influenced transplant survival were low forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) pre-transplant, lower arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, bilobar transplant, elderly recipient and donor, donor-recipient graft disproportion requiring a surgical reduction (Tailor), type of combined transplant, need for cardiopulmonary bypass during the surgery, death of the donor due to head trauma, hospitalization status before surgery, and female and male recipient donor sex. Conclusions These results show the difficulty of the problem which required the introduction of other variables into the analysis. The combination of classical statistical methods and machine learning can support decision-making about the compatibility between donors and recipients. This helps to facilitate reliable prediction and to optimize the grafts for transplantation, thereby improving the transplanted patient survival rate."

We validated the PRO using factor analysis to define the latent construct domains, then calculated the internal consistency (Cronbach's-α), and construct validity (correlation).There were 340 patients with ABI (N = 91, median age = 55.1, 41% female), MS (N = 99, age = 58.9, 69%) and PD (N = 150, age = 74.5, 40%). Factor analysis suggested the PRO offered three domains of: physical health; functionality-capacity and mental health. All factors correlated strongly with the three disease-specific instruments, and the overall PRO had a large correlation with the EQ-5D (correlation>0.8) offering good construct validity and excellent internal consistency (∝>0.89).The PRO offered promising psychometric properties and could be used in place of disease specific questionnaires for patients with ABI, MS, and PD. The PRO has three construct domains, describing patients': mental health; physical health; and functional-capacity, and may be used in routine clinical practice. The PRO offered both relevance to each of the three separate neurological conditions and generalisability across all the conditions, increasing its utility."
https://openalex.org/W3165395190,"In modern humans, facial soft tissue thicknesses have been shown to covary with craniometric dimensions. However, to date it has not been confirmed whether these relationships are shared with non-human apes. In this study, we analyze these relationships in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with the aim of producing regression models for approximating facial soft tissue thicknesses in Plio-Pleistocene hominids. Using CT scans of 19 subjects, 637 soft tissue, and 349 craniometric measurements, statistically significant multiple regression models were established for 26 points on the face and head. Examination of regression model validity resulted in minimal differences between observed and predicted soft tissue thickness values. Assessment of interspecies compatibility using a bonobo (Pan paniscus) and modern human subject resulted in minimal differences for the bonobo but large differences for the modern human. These results clearly show that (1) soft tissue thicknesses covary with craniometric dimensions in P. troglodytes, (2) confirms that such covariation is uniformly present in both extant Homo and Pan species, and (3) suggests that chimp-derived regression models have interspecies compatibility with hominids who have similar craniometric dimensions to P. troglodytes. As the craniometric dimensions of early hominids, such as South African australopithecines, are more similar to P. troglodytes than those of H. sapiens, chimpanzee-derived regression models may be used for approximating their craniofacial anatomy. It is hoped that the results of the present study and the reference dataset for facial soft tissue thicknesses of chimpanzees it provides will encourage further research into this topic."
https://openalex.org/W3164323661,"Background Even though maternal health was highly targeted in different global strategies, maternal mortality could not be decreased as was expected. Besides this, prior decomposition analysis to the possible cause of changes to timely first antenatal booking has not been conducted. Therefore, this study aimed to assess determinants of change in timely first antenatal booking among pregnant women in Ethiopia. Methods The study utilized three consecutive Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) datasets which were collected through cross-sectional study design. The number of pregnant women who gave birth in 2005, 2011 and 2016 survey included in the analysis was 7,307, 7,908 and 7,590 respectively. The data were analyzed by using Stata/SE version 14.0. Logit-based decomposition analysis was done to identify contributing factors for change in timely first antenatal booking and statistical significance was determined by using P-value. Results The trend of timely first antenatal booking was increased from 6% to 20% in the last ten years. The analysis revealed that 14% of the overall change was because of the change in women’s composition. Changes in the composition of women according to region, education and occupation status were the major sources of this change. The remaining, 86% of the change was due to differences in the coefficient. Mostly, the change in behaviors of the Oromia population, those who have lived in the rural areas and male household head were some of the contributing factors for the increase in timely first antenatal booking. Conclusions There was a significant increase in timely first antenatal booking among pregnant women in Ethiopia from 2005 to 2016 EDHS. The change in the women composition according to residency, education and occupation status of women and the difference in behaviors like: behavior of rural residents and male household head contributed to the majority of the change. Interventions targeting the male household head, rural residents and those women who lived in the Oromia region should be emphasized to increase further timely booking. In addition, promoting women in terms of education and creating job opportunities could be the other recalled intervention areas of the country."
https://openalex.org/W3165012023,"Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) using the faecal immunochemical test (FIT) is widely advocated. Few studies have compared the rate of detecting colonoscopic pathologies in single compared to double FIT-positive follow-up colonoscopy-compliant individuals in a two-sample national FIT screening program.To compare CRC incidence in double FIT-positive versus single FIT-positive individuals using a retrospective cohort of patients from a tertiary hospital in Singapore.Retrospective cohort study.Data was extracted from one public tertiary hospital in Singapore.1,422 FIT-positive individuals from the national FIT screening program who were referred to the hospital from 1st January 2017 to 31st March 2020 for follow-up consultation and diagnostic colonoscopy.The exposure of interest was a positive result on both FIT kits. The main outcome was a follow-up diagnostic colonoscopy finding of CRC. The secondary outcome was a diagnostic colonoscopy finding of a colorectal polyp.Incidence density of CRC was 1.15 and 13.10 per 100,000 person-months, in the single and double FIT-positive group, respectively. This resulted in an incidence rate ratio of 11.40 (95% CI = 4.34, 35.09). Colorectal polyp detection was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the double (103 of 173 participants; 59.5%) compared to the single (279 of 671 participants; 41.6%) FIT-positive group.The key limitation of this study was the relatively small cohort derived from a single tertiary hospital, as this had the effect of limiting the number of incident cases, resulting in comparatively imprecise CIs.Double FIT-positive individuals are significantly more likely to have a colonoscopy finding of incident CRC or premalignant polyp than single FIT-positive individuals. Clinicians and policymakers should consider updating their CRC screening protocols accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W3165099066,"Animal cell culture, with single cells growing in suspension, ideally in a chemically defined environment, is a mainstay of biopharmaceutical production. The synthetic environment lacks exogenous growth factors and usually requires a time-consuming adaptation process to select cell clones that proliferate in suspension to high cell numbers. The molecular mechanisms that facilitate the adaptation and that take place inside the cell are largely unknown. Especially for cell lines that are used for virus antigen production such as baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, the restriction of virus growth through the evolution of undesired cell characteristics is highly unwanted. The comparison between adherently growing BHK cells and suspension cells with different susceptibility to foot-and-mouth disease virus revealed differences in the expression of cellular receptors such as integrins and heparan sulfates, and in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Transcriptome analyses and growth kinetics demonstrated the diversity of BHK cell lines and confirmed the importance of well-characterized parental cell clones and mindful screening to make sure that essential cellular features do not get lost during adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W3165782413,"This paper explores the association between job satisfaction and gender for workers with disabilities, using data from the Panel Survey of Employment for the Disabled, which interviews officially registered persons with disabilities in Korea. To take full advantage of the longitudinal data, we apply random-effects ordered probit models to investigate the underlying factors that affect gender differentials in job satisfaction. Our findings reveal that merely different work values between women and men do not account for the significantly higher job satisfaction among women. We suggest that workers' expectations play a role in explaining why female workers are happier in the workplace than their male counterparts; that is, holding other factors constant, women's expectations from jobs are lower than men's. This hypothesis is partially supported by the empirical analyses that gender differentials diminish among the highly educated workers, for whom there is less likely to be a gender gap in terms of job expectations."
https://openalex.org/W3164252226,"Although different strategies have been developed to generate transgenic poultry, low efficiency of germline transgene transmission has remained a challenge in poultry transgenesis. Herein, we developed an efficient germline transgenesis method using a lentiviral vector system in chickens through multiple injections of transgenes into embryos at different stages of development. The embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) vasculature was successfully used as a novel route of gene transfer into germline tissues. Compared to the other routes of viral vector administration, the embryo's bloodstream at Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) stages 14-15 achieved the highest rate of germline transmission (GT), 7.7%. Single injection of viral vectors into the CAM vasculature resulted in a GT efficiency of 2.7%, which was significantly higher than the 0.4% obtained by injection into embryos at the blastoderm stage. Double injection of viral vectors into the bloodstream at HH stages 14-15 and through CAM was the most efficient method for producing germline chimeras, giving a GT rate of 13.6%. The authors suggest that the new method described in this study could be efficiently used to produce transgenic poultry in virus-mediated gene transfer systems."
https://openalex.org/W3165640943,"Measures of heart rate variability (and heart rate more generally) are providing powerful insights into the physiological drivers of behaviour. Resting heart rate variability (HRV) can be used as an indicator of individual differences in temperament and reactivity to physical and psychological stress. There is increasing interest in deriving such measures from free ranging wild animals, where individuals are exposed to the natural and anthropogenic stressors of life. We describe a robust, externally mounted heart rate monitor for use in wild mammals, deployed here on wild breeding adult female grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), that delivers millisecond precise measures of inter beat intervals (IBIs), allowing computation of resting HRV parameters. Based on Firstbeat™ heart rate belts, our system allows for remote, continuous recording of IBI data from over 30 individuals simultaneously at ranges of up to 200m. We assessed the accuracy of the IBI data provided by the Firstbeat™ system using concurrent IBI data derived from in-field electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Bland-Altmann analyses demonstrated high correspondence between the two sets of IBI data, with a mean difference of 0.87±0.16ms. We used generalized additive mixed-effects models to examine the impact of the default Firstbeat™ software artefact correction procedure upon the generation of anomalous data (flats and stairs). Artefact correction and individual activity were major causes of flats and stairs. We used simulations and models to assess the impact of these errors on estimates of resting HRV and to inform criteria for subsampling relatively error free IBI traces. These analyses allowed us to establish stringent filtering procedures to remove traces with excessive numbers of artefacts, including flats and stairs. Even with strict criteria for removing potentially erroneous data, the abundance of data yielded by the Firstbeat™ system provides the potential to extract robust estimates of resting HRV. We discuss the advantages and limitations of our system for applications beyond the study system described here."
