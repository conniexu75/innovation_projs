https://openalex.org/W2602856331,"Global food consumption drives irrigation for crops, which depletes aquifers in some regions; here we quantify the volumes of groundwater depletion associated with global food production and international trade. International trade is increasingly transporting 'hidden' resources and environmental factors from one country to another. For example, the water used to produce a spear of asparagus eaten in London might come from irrigation in South America. Similarly, pollution generated in China might be traceable to consumer demand in the United States. Carole Dalin et al. now extend this idea to the non-renewable groundwater that is consumed for agricultural trade. They find that 11 per cent of groundwater extraction is linked to agricultural trade, with Pakistan, the United States and India accounting for two-thirds of the global totals. The research reveals the degree to which food consumption in one country can lead to groundwater depletion in others, highlighting the need to better consider issues of sustainability and equity in the international food trade. Recent hydrological modelling1 and Earth observations2,3 have located and quantified alarming rates of groundwater depletion worldwide. This depletion is primarily due to water withdrawals for irrigation1,2,4, but its connection with the main driver of irrigation, global food consumption, has not yet been explored. Here we show that approximately eleven per cent of non-renewable groundwater use for irrigation is embedded in international food trade, of which two-thirds are exported by Pakistan, the USA and India alone. Our quantification of groundwater depletion embedded in the world’s food trade is based on a combination of global, crop-specific estimates of non-renewable groundwater abstraction and international food trade data. A vast majority of the world’s population lives in countries sourcing nearly all their staple crop imports from partners who deplete groundwater to produce these crops, highlighting risks for global food and water security. Some countries, such as the USA, Mexico, Iran and China, are particularly exposed to these risks because they both produce and import food irrigated from rapidly depleting aquifers. Our results could help to improve the sustainability of global food production and groundwater resource management by identifying priority regions and agricultural products at risk as well as the end consumers of these products."

The expression and distinct prognostic value of topoisomerase isoforms in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not well established. In the current study, we have examined the mRNA expression of topoisomerase isoforms by using Oncomine analysis and investigated their prognostic value via the Kaplan–Meier plotter database in NSCLC patients. Our analysis indicated that the expression level of topoisomerases in lung cancer was higher compared with normal tissues. Especially, high expression of two topoisomerase isoforms, TOP2A and TOP3A, was found to be correlated to worse overall survival (OS) in all NSCLC and lung adenocarcinoma (Ade) patients, but not in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients. In a contrast, high expression of isoforms TOP1 and TOP2B indicated better OS in all NSCLC and Ade, but not in SCC patients. Meanwhile, high expression of TOP1MT and TOP3B was not correlated with OS in NSCLC patients. Furthermore, we also demonstrated a relationship between topoisomerase isoforms and the clinicopathological features for the NSCLC patients, such as grades, clinical stages, lymph node status, smoking status, gender, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. These results support that TOP2A and TOP3A are associated with worse prognosis in NSCLC patients. In addition, our study also shows that TOP1 and TOP2B contribute to favorable prognosis in NSCLC patients. The exact prognostic significance of TOP1MT and TOP3B need to be further elucidated. Comprehensive evaluation of expression and prognosis of topoisomerase isoforms will be a benefit for the better understanding of heterogeneity and complexity in the molecular biology of NSCLC, paving a way for more accurate prediction of prognosis and discovery of potential drug targets for NSCLC patients."

Throughout its life cycle, the T. cruzi parasite faces several alternating events of cell division and cell differentiation in which exponential and stationary growth phases play key biological roles. It is well accepted that arrest of the cell division in the epimastigote stage, both in the midgut of the triatomine insect and in vitro, is required for metacyclogenesis, and it has been previously shown that the parasites change the expression profile of several proteins when entering this quiescent stage. However, little is known about the metabolic changes that epimastigotes undergo before they develop into the metacyclic trypomastigote stage. We applied targeted metabolomics to measure the metabolic intermediates in the most relevant pathways for energy metabolism and oxidative imbalance in exponentially growing and stationary growth-arrested epimastigote parasites. We show for the first time that T. cruzi epimastigotes transitioning from the exponential to the stationary phase exhibit a finely tuned adaptive metabolic mechanism that enables switching from glucose to amino acid consumption, which is more abundant in the stationary phase. This metabolic plasticity appears to be crucial for survival of the T. cruzi parasite in the myriad different environmental conditions to which it is exposed during its life cycle.

This metabolic plasticity appears to be crucial for survival of the T. cruzi parasite in the myriad different environmental conditions to which it is exposed during its life cycle. Cell growth, both in natural environments or in in vitro culture, usually presents in two phases: the exponential phase where cells divide at a roughly constant rate, and the stationary phase where cells slow down or stop the cell cycle and division. During the exponential phase, cells go through the well described canonical cell cycle of G1 → S → G2 → M. In the stationary phase, cells leave the regular cell cycle to enter a resting state known as quiescence, which is highly relevant because it corresponds to the physiological state in which most cells from both unicellular and multicellular organisms spend most of their life (1Gray J.V. Petsko G.A. Johnston G.C. Ringe D. Singer R.A. Werner-Washburne M. Sleeping beauty: quiescence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 187-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, is a protozoan parasite with a complex life cycle involving a triatomine insect and mammals. Throughout its life cycle, the T. cruzi parasite faces several alternated events of cell division and cell differentiation. Briefly, insects are infected during a blood meal from a mammal having non-dividing forms of the parasite, denominated trypomastigotes, present in their blood. Once in the midgut of the triatomine insect, the trypomastigotes differentiate to replicative non-infective epimastigotes, which proliferate and colonize the digestive tube. After the blood meal, nutrients are consumed by the intestinal epithelium, the parasite, and the intestinal microbiota population; therefore, the replicative epimastigotes eventually face nutrient starvation. Under this situation of metabolic stress, cell division is arrested, and the parasites adhere to the intestinal epithelium along the midgut. In the terminal portion of the digestive tube, epimastigotes start the process to differentiate to infective, non-dividing metacyclic trypomastigotes (2Brener Z. Life cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi.Rev. Inst. Med. Trop. Sao Paulo. 1971; 13: 171-178PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this differentiation process, called metacyclogenesis, is fueled by amino acids present in the urine at the distal portion of the triatomine's intestine such as proline (Pro), aspartate (Asp), and glutamate (Glu), among others (3Barrett F.M. Friend W.G. Differences in the concentration of free amino acids in the haemolymph of adult male and female Rhodnius prolixus.Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1975; 52: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In a new blood meal on a mammalian host the infected triatomine, which usually defecates near the biting point, will contaminate the skin or mucosa with metacyclic trypomastigotes expelled along with their feces, allowing the parasite to internalize and establish infection in a new host (2Brener Z. Life cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi.Rev. Inst. Med. Trop. Sao Paulo. 1971; 13: 171-178PubMed Google Scholar). It is well accepted that arrest of the cell division in the epimastigote stage, both in vivo and in vitro, is required for metacyclogenesis, and it has been previously shown that the parasites change the expression profile of several proteins when entering this quiescent stage (4Hernández R.

In addition, a previous work comparing exponential and stationary phases of T. cruzi epimastigotes (EPE 5The abbreviations used are: EPEexponential phase epimastigoteSPEstationary phase epimastigoteTCAtricarboxylic acidP5CΔ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylateP5CDHP5C dehydrogenaseTSHtrypanothioneRTPreverse trans-sulfuration pathwayMRMmultiple-reaction monitoringPCAprincipal component analysisBCAAbranched-chain amino acidγ-GSγ-glutamate semi-aldehydeCBScystathionine β-synthasePyrpyruvateα-KGα-ketoglutarateESIelectrospray ionization. and SPE, respectively) has assessed the physiological changes occurring at each stage and how some genes are regulated during the epimastigote growth to understand their possible participation in the metacyclogenesis (4Hernández R.

Early studies have focused on specific enzymes involved in energy metabolism as well as a specific subset of metabolites (7Cazzulo J.J. Energy metabolism in Trypanosoma cruzi.Subcell. Biochem. 1992; 18: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, a systematic analysis of the metabolic changes associated with energy metabolism that occurs during exponential and stationary phases of growth in T. cruzi epimastigotes has not been performed. We hypothesized that T. cruzi epimastigotes finely orchestrate a metabolic switch, especially related to the energy metabolism, when exposed to nutritional starvation. Here, we show for the first time T. cruzi epimastigotes transitioning from exponential to stationary phase (Fig. 1) present a distinct metabolic profile regarding their energy metabolism and redox imbalance, including amino acids, carbohydrates, and the tricarboxylic acids (TCA) cycle intermediates. To assess the main metabolic changes between exponentially growing and stationary arrested epimastigote T. cruzi parasites, we focused on a set of 47 metabolic intermediates from the most relevant pathways for energy metabolism and oxidative imbalance. Selected metabolites (supplemental Table S1) were analyzed in positive and negative modes using two different chromatography separations. Our initial hypothesis was that EPE and SPE constitute two different populations in terms of energy metabolome composition due to their adaptation to different nutritional conditions. To assess this hypothesis, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) where results are displayed as score plots, and each point represents a sample that when clustered together indicates similar metabolite composition based on the selected metabolites for the targeted analysis (Fig. 2). PCA analysis revealed a clear separation between the two growth phases of T. cruzi epimastigotes. This result strongly supports the proposed hypothesis that T. cruzi EPE and SPE present different energy and oxidative imbalance-related metabolic states. Interestingly, our results also revealed a greater metabolic heterogeneity among stationary phase cells than exponential phase cells. To further identify the underlying metabolites responsible for the segregation between both T. cruzi EPE and SPE, a heat map analysis was performed. In contrast to the scores plots, a heat map displays the actual data values that allow visualization of changing patterns in metabolite levels across samples and across experimental conditions. The heat map analysis showed that amino acids and their metabolic intermediates were increased in the stationary phase when compared with exponential phase, whereas glycolysis and TCA intermediates were reduced (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 1). Consequently, we pursued a more detailed analysis for each metabolic pathway to assess specific changes that occur when parasites are exposed to nutritional starvation. To study in more detail the metabolic switch from a glucose-based to an amino acid-based metabolism in T. cruzi epimastigotes, we measured the relative levels of the first and last metabolites of glycolysis, i.e. glucose and pyruvate (Pyr), and all the intermediates of the TCA cycle, except oxaloacetate that could not be resolved by any of the two chromatographic methods used for this study (Fig. 4). As shown in the heat map (Fig. 3), both glycolysis and most of the TCA-related metabolite levels decreased during the transition of parasites from EPE to SPE. The relatively higher levels of glucose during the exponential phase as compared with the stationary phase could be explained by its uptake from the extracellular medium by the exponentially replicating cells due to its presence in high concentrations in the fresh medium (2 mg/ml). Notably, the intracellular concentration of glucose was still detected in SPE instead of being completely consumed as we would expect because extracellular glucose has been depleted at that stage (8Shaw A.K. Kalem M.C. Zimmer S.L. Mitochondrial gene expression is responsive to starvation stress and developmental transition in Trypanosoma cruzi.mSphere. 2016; 1e00051Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This finding may indicate that in SPE either amino acids are serving for de novo synthesis of glucose to maintain a certain intracellular level or its consumption is arrested. Alongside a decrease in the glucose content, the relative abundance of Pyr as well as the metabolic intermediates canonically linked to the TCA cycle, such as isocitrate, citrate, succinyl-CoA, and malate, were significantly reduced in SPE when compared with EPE (Fig. 4 and supplemental Table S2). By contrast, α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) was the only derivative from the amino acid oxidation that appeared to exhibit around six times higher abundance in the SPE. The increased levels of α-KG are compatible with an increase of amino acids catabolism in SPE (Fig. 5). T. cruzi epimastigotes depend on different catabolic routes leading to α-KG generation for energy production, such as the Pro (9Mantilla B.S. Paes L.S. Pral E.M. Martil D.E. Thiemann O.H.

Mantilla B.S. Barisón M.J. Wrenger C. Silber A.M. The uniqueness of the Trypanosoma cruzi mitochondrion: opportunities to identify new drug target for the treatment of Chagas disease.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2011; 17: 2074-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It worth mentioning that several metabolites are present simultaneously in different subcellular compartments such as malate, which is present in the glycosome, cytoplasm, and mitochondrion (Fig. 4). Because we measured the total level of a metabolite, the detected changes in their levels are the result of all metabolic contributions independently of their localization. Glu and α-KG constitute the main metabolic bridge between amino acid metabolism and the TCA cycle. Interestingly, our results showed that the levels of Glu remained nearly constant in both growth phases. As shown in Fig. 5, it is worth stressing that Glu is a branching point for several metabolic pathways. Epimastigotes are able to acquire Glu through a variety of processes, which include its uptake from the extracellular medium, biosynthesis by reductive amination of α-KG catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase, which is NADH- and NADPH-dependent, transamination reactions, or by oxidizing other amino acids such as Pro, His, and glutamine (Gln). Notably, both Glu uptake and its precursors such as α-KG, Pro, His, Asp and its derivative asparagine were detected at higher levels in the SPE as compared with EPE (Fig. 5). In addition, the uptake of Pro and His was also increased in SPE. Because their main metabolic fate is Glu, our results suggest that the metabolism in SPE shifts toward Glu production and further oxidation in the TCA cycle through α-KG. However, it is also possible that the concomitant increase of Pro, His, and Glu uptake could lead to an accumulation of these precursors. In both cases, our findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that Glu or its 2-oxoacid derivative is critically involved in the parasite's survival in this phase. T. cruzi is the only trypanosomatid equipped with putative genes encoding the four enzymatic steps connecting His to Glu as follows: His ammonia-lyase, urocanate hydratase, imidazolone propionase, and formiminoglutamase. Recently, it was shown that this parasite can fully oxidize His, producing CO2 and triggering an increase of the mitochondrial membrane potential and O2 consumption (11Barison M.J. Damasceno F.S. Mantilla B.S. Silber A.M. The active transport of histidine and its role in ATP production in Trypanosoma cruzi.J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2016; 48: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, His is an essential amino acid in T. cruzi; therefore, its intracellular levels depend on both its uptake and degradation rates. Our results show that the intracellular levels of His and urocanate, the first metabolic intermediate in the His metabolism, were significantly increased in SPE as compared with EPE. Therefore, we measured His transport-specific activity in both EPE and SPE populations, and it was slightly increased in SPE when compared with EPE (Fig. 5 and supplemental Table S2). The small increase in His uptake could contribute to the increased intracellular levels of His and urocanate in SPE. Our results showed that the intracellular levels of Pro were significantly increased in SPE as compared with EPE (Fig. 5 and supplemental Table S2). Pro levels were shown to be critical in several biological processes in T. cruzi epimastigotes, such as differentiation, resistance to oxidative imbalance, as well as response to nutritional and thermal stress (10Paes L.S.

Proline modulates the Trypanosoma cruzi resistance to reactive oxygen species and drugs through a novel dl-proline transporter.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9e92028Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Differently from His, epimastigotes were able to synthesize Pro. Therefore, the balance of Pro levels is more complex than His and is determined by the interplay among its degradation, biosynthesis from Glu, and uptake rates through two active transporters. Similar to most organisms, Pro degradation to Glu occurs through two enzymatic steps where Pro is first converted into Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) by a Pro dehydrogenase with the production of FADH2 followed by conversion into Glu by P5C dehydrogenase (P5CDH) with the production of NADH (Fig. 5 and supplemental Table S2). Both enzymatic steps by themselves are able to energize the mitochondria, promoting the production of ATP without requiring the deamination of Glu and further full oxidation through the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation to obtain energy. Differently from other organisms, this pathway is not branched because there is no functional ornithine aminotransferase in T. cruzi epimastigotes able to interconvert P5C and ornithine (12Lisvane Silva P. Mantilla B.S. Barisón M.J. Wrenger C. Silber A.M. The uniqueness of the Trypanosoma cruzi mitochondrion: opportunities to identify new drug target for the treatment of Chagas disease.Curr. Pharm.

Amino acid metabolic routes in Trypanosoma cruzi: possible therapeutic targets against Chagas' disease.Curr. Drug. Targets Infect. Disord. 2005; 5: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The lack of an ornithine aminotransferase interconverting ornithine and P5C indicates that all of the oxidized Pro have to be converted into P5C/γGS and Glu and that all the biosynthesized Pro have to be produced from Glu. Thus, the relative gene expression levels and specific enzymatic activities of P5CR (Pro biosynthesis) and P5CDH (Pro degradation) both in EPE and SPE could indicate the predominant direction of Pro metabolism (biosynthesis or degradation) in each phase (Fig. 6). Interestingly, both protein and enzymatic activity levels of P5CR were higher in the EPE than in the SPE, whereas the opposite was observed for P5CDH (Fig. 6, B and C). This suggests an up-regulation of the synthesis of Pro during the exponential phase, which could drive the metabolism to a pre-adaptive accumulation of this amino acid. It is worth mentioning that Pro can be consumed in SPE to support metacyclogenesis and can be used by metacyclic trypomastigotes to energize the invasion of the mammalian hosts (18Martins R.M. Covarrubias C. Rojas R.G. Silber A.M. Yoshida N. Use of l-proline and ATP production by Trypanosoma cruzi metacyclic forms as requirements for host cell invasion.Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 3023-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In fact, from all the selected metabolites analyzed in this study, Pro presented the highest levels, measured as metabolite/internal standard area ratio of MS signals detected by MRM normalized to the cell numbers, in both T. cruzi EPE and SPE (Fig. 5). Because we detected differences between Pro synthesis and degradation in EPE and SPE, we evaluated the contribution of its uptake in both growth phases. Previously, we described and characterized two Pro transport systems, designated A and B (19Silber A.M. Tonelli R.R. Martinelli M. Colli W. Alves M.J. Active transport of l-proline in Trypanosoma cruzi.J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 2002; 49: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both systems had different kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics, showing substrate saturations at 0.75 mm (system A) and 3 mm (systems A + B). Thus, transport activities for both systems were measured at substrate-saturating concentrations. Interestingly, system A did not show variations in Pro uptake, but system B increased ∼3 times its activity (Fig. 5). The increase in the Pro uptake may be compensating for the simultaneous up-regulation of Pro consumption and down-regulation of Pro synthesis, avoiding a futile cycle, and could be responsible for Pro accumulation in SPE. Leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile), and valine (Val) are branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), and the only ones involved in the energy production in T. cruzi that are not directly connected to Glu (20Mancilla R. Naquira C. Lanas C. Protein biosynthesis in trypanosomidae. II. The metabolic fate of dl-leucine-1-C14 in Trypanosoma cruzi.Exp. Parasitol. 1967; 21: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These amino acids are oxidized to acetyl- or methylmalonyl-CoA and further oxidized through the TCA cycle. Similar to most eukaryotic cells, BCAA are essential for T. cruzi. Therefore, their intracellular levels also depend on their uptake and metabolism. As described previously, all three BCAA are taken up by the same transporter (21Manchola N.C. Rapado L.N. Barisón M.J. Silber A.M. Biochemical characterization of branched chain amino acids uptake in Trypanosoma cruzi.J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 2016; 63: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and their specific transport activity did not change in SPE when compared with EPE (Fig. 5). The fact that the intracellular levels for Ile and Val are slightly reduced, while Leu remained constant in SPE compared with EPE, indicates that Ile and Val catabolism is more active than Leu during the stationary phase (Fig. 5). An important group of metabolites related to energy metabolism and defense against oxidative stress are polyamines and the thiol-containing amino acids. To assess potential variations of these thiol-containing metabolites between EPE and SPE, we measured the levels of intermediates involved in the different routes for cysteine (Cys) biosynthesis as well as potential variations in the levels of glutathione, spermidine, and trypanothione (TSH). The latter represents the main antioxidant agent in the redox metabolism in trypanosomatids. As shown in Fig. 7, the relative abundance of the intermediates belonging to the reverse trans-sulfuration pathway (RTP) (serine, homocysteine, and cystathionine) as well as those related to de novo synthesis of cysteine (serine and O-acetylserine) were increased in SPE as compared with EPE. These results strengthened previous findings showing that unlike most living organisms T. cruzi displays an unusual redundancy in cysteine production by the co-existence of de novo synthesis and the RTP. As schematized in Fig. 7, precursors such as serine, acetyl-CoA, and O-acetylserine are required for de novo synthesis of cysteine. This is a two-step pathway catalyzed by serine acetyltransferase and cysteine synthase, and both enzymes have been found to be functional in T. cruzi (22Nozaki T. Shigeta Y. Saito-Nakano Y. Imada M. Kruger W.D. Characterization of transsulfuration and cysteine biosynthetic pathways in the protozoan hemoflagellate, Trypanosoma cruzi.

Functional characterization of enzymes involved in cysteine biosynthesis and H(2)S production in Trypanosoma cruzi.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2012; 185: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), which catalyzes the first step of the RTP, is distinguished from its mammalian counterpart by its broader substrate specificity. In addition to catalyzing the condensation of serine with homocysteine to produce cystathionine, the T. cruzi CBS can also act as a serine sulfhydrylase and a cysteine synthase. Given that cystathionine γ-lyase is also functional in T. cruzi, cystathionine is expected to be also cleaved to produce cysteine, the end product of the RTP. In contrast, synthesis of TSH is known to be essential for neutralizing free radicals, thereby contributing to the redox homeostasis in all of the developmental stages of T. cruzi. However, our results unexpectedly showed that the availability of Glu and the higher abundance of cysteine in SPE were not reflected in an increase in the relative abundance of TSH in SPE (Fig. 7). It is possible that the synthesis of TSH is limited by the significantly lower abundance of spermidine in SPE, which is essential to accomplish the final steps in TSH biosynthesis. T. cruzi is the only eukaryotic organism unable to synthesize polyamines de novo because it lacks ornithine and arginine decarboxylases, the enzymes catalyzing the first step in polyamines biosynthesis (24Hunter K.J. Le Quesne S.A. Fairlamb A.H. Identification and biosynthesis of N1,N9-bis(glutathionyl)aminopropylcadaverine (homotrypanothione) in Trypanosoma cruzi.Eur. J.

Interestingly, despite there being no evidence of the urea cycle in the parasite's genome, ornithine and citrulline were detected in both growth phases, and ornithine levels were around four times higher in SPE compared with EPE, whereas arginine and citrulline levels were similar between both phases (supplemental Fig. 1). Spermidine is involved in cell cycle control in trypanosomatids (26González N.S. Huber A. Algranati I.D. Spermidine is essential for normal proliferation of trypanosomatid protozoa.FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, our results showed that the intracellular levels of spermidine were decreased in SPE compared with EPE (Fig. 7). This finding is in agreement with the fact that in SPE the cellular replication process, one of the most polyamines demanding cellular processes, is arrested. In this work, we applied a targeted metabolomic approach to assess the metabolic changes that occur in T. cruzi epimastigote parasites transitioning from the exponential to the stationary phase of growth. Herein, we established a correlation between the relative abundance of assessed metabolites with a metabolic process resulting from the nutritional conditions that parasites have to face during exponential and stationary growth. We carefully normalized the data, and the presented results have been obtained from independent biological replicates that also included new media preparation"

The 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (Grp78) is a heat shock protein 70-kDa family member and one of the most abundant chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it helps fold newly synthesized peptides. Because of its prominent role in protein folding, and also ER stress, we hypothesized that Grp78 might be involved in fat body cell homeostasis and vitellogenesis and a regulatory target of JH. We report here that the migratory locust Locusta migratoria possesses two Grp78 genes that are differentially regulated by JH. We found that Grp78-1 is regulated by JH through Mcm4/7-dependent DNA replication and polyploidization, whereas Grp78-2 expression is directly activated by the JH-receptor complex comprising methoprene-tolerant and Taiman proteins. Interestingly, Grp78-2 expression in the fat body is about 10-fold higher than that of Grp78-1. Knockdown of either Grp78-1 or Grp78-2 significantly reduced levels of vitellogenin (Vg) protein, accompanied by retarded maturation of oocytes. Depletion of both Grp78-1 and Grp78-2 resulted in ER stress and apoptosis in the fat body and in severely defective Vg synthesis and oocyte maturation. These results indicate a crucial role of Grp78 in JH-dependent vitellogenesis and egg production. The presence and differential regulation of two Grp78 genes in L. migratoria likely help accelerate the production of this chaperone in the fat body to facilitate folding of massively synthesized Vg and other proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2602007372,"Yams (Dioscorea sp.) are staple food crops for millions of people in tropical and subtropical regions. Dioscorea alata, also known as greater yam, is one of the major cultivated species and most widely distributed throughout the tropics. Despite its economic and cultural importance, very little is known about its origin, diversity and genetics. As a consequence, breeding efforts for resistance to its main disease, anthracnose, have been fairly limited. The objective of this study was to contribute to the understanding of D. alata genetic diversity by genotyping 384 accessions from different geographical regions (South Pacific, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean), using 24 microsatellite markers. Diversity structuration was assessed via Principal Coordinate Analysis, UPGMA analysis and the Bayesian approach implemented in STRUCTURE. Our results revealed the existence of a wide genetic diversity and a significant structuring associated with geographic origin, ploidy levels and morpho-agronomic characteristics. Seventeen major groups of genetically close cultivars have been identified, including eleven groups of diploid cultivars, four groups of triploids and two groups of tetraploids. STRUCTURE revealed the existence of six populations in the diploid genetic pool and a few admixed cultivars. These results will be very useful for rationalizing D. alata genetic resources in breeding programs across different regions and for improving germplasm conservation methods."
https://openalex.org/W2604019593,"Background In 2010–2014, approximately 86% of abortions took place in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although abortion incidence varies minimally across geographical regions, it varies widely by subregion and within countries by subgroups of women. Differential abortion levels stem from variation in the level of unintended pregnancies and in the likelihood that women with unintended pregnancies obtain abortions. Objectives To examine the characteristics of women obtaining induced abortions in LMICs. Methods We use data from official statistics, population-based surveys, and abortion patient surveys to examine variation in the percentage distribution of abortions and abortion rates by age at abortion, marital status, parity, wealth, education, and residence. We analyze data from five countries in Africa, 13 in Asia, eight in Europe, and two in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Results Women across all sociodemographic subgroups obtain abortions. In most countries, women aged 20–29 obtained the highest proportion of abortions, and while adolescents obtained a substantial fraction of abortions, they do not make up a disproportionate share. Region-specific patterns were observed in the distribution of abortions by parity. In many countries, a higher fraction of abortions occurred among women of high socioeconomic status, as measured by wealth status, educational attainment, and urban residence. Due to limited data on marital status, it is unknown whether married or unmarried women make up a larger share of abortions. Conclusions These findings help to identify subgroups of women with disproportionate levels of abortion, and can inform policies and programs to reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancies; and in LMICs that have restrictive abortion laws, these findings can also inform policies to minimize the consequences of unsafe abortion and motivate liberalization of abortion laws. Program planners, policymakers, and advocates can use this information to improve access to safe abortion services, postabortion care, and contraceptive services."
https://openalex.org/W2600905997,"Tetraarsenic hexoxide (As4O6) has been used in Korean folk medicines for the treatment of cancer, however its anti-cancer mechanisms remain obscured. Here, this study investigated the anti-cancer effect of As4O6 on SW620 human colon cancer cells. As4O6 has showed a dose-dependent inhibition of SW620 cells proliferation. As4O6 significantly increased the sub-G1 and G2/M phase population, and Annexin V-positive cells in a dose-dependent manner. G2/M arrest was concomitant with augment of p21 and reduction in cyclin B1, cell division cycle 2 (cdc 2) expressions. Nuclear condensation, cleaved nuclei and poly (adenosine diphosphate‑ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation were also observed in As4O6-treated SW620 cells. As4O6 induced depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, ΔΨm) but not reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Further, As4O6 increased death receptor 5 (DR5), not DR4 and suppressed the B‑cell lymphoma‑2 (Bcl-2) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) family proteins. As4O6 increased the formation of AVOs (lysosomes and autophagolysosomes) and promoted the conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II in a dose- and time- dependent manner. Interestingly, a specific phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt inhibitor (LY294002) augmented the As4O6 induced cell death; whereas p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) inhibitor (SB203580) abrogated the cell death. Thus, the present study provides the first evidence that As4O6 induced G2/M arrest, apoptosis and autophagic cell death through PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways alteration in SW620 cells."

An original inflammation-based staging system for predicting survival in patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with recombinant human type-5 adenovirus H101 is not available. This study aimed to validate the prognostic value of inflammation scores for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who were treated with TACE combined with H101.The data from 216 patients with HCC who underwent TACE combined with H101 from January 2007 to July 2015 were retrospectively collected, and the association of the inflammation scores with overall survival (OS) was analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables associated with OS. The prognostic value of the inflammation scores, including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil/ platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR-PLR), modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), prognostic index (PI), tumor-node-metastasis (TNM), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) and Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) staging systems were analyzed and compared using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs).The estimated 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 61.3%, 44.2%, and 40.5% for the entire study cohort, respectively; the median OS was 17 months. According to the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, the pretreatment NLR, tumor diameter and pretreatment alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were independent predictors of OS. The CLIP score had superior discriminative abilities compared with other staging systems, and the NLR-PLR score consistently displayed a higher AUROC value than the other inflammation-based prognostic scores. The combination of the NLR-PLR and CLIP scores exhibited a superior prognostic ability for OS compared to the NLR-PLR or CLIP scores alone.The NLR-PLR score is a more powerful predictive system than the other inflammation-based scores for patients with HCC who were treated with TACE and H101. The predictive ability may be improved by utilizing a combination of the NLR-PLR and CLIP scores."
https://openalex.org/W2598519737,"Mild hypothermia improves survival and neurological recovery after cardiac arrest (CA) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine whether mild hypothermia alleviates early blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. We investigated the effects of mild hypothermia on neurologic outcome, survival rate, brain water content, BBB permeability and changes in tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs) after CA and CPR. Pigs were subjected to 8 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation followed by CPR. Mild hypothermia (33°C) was intravascularly induced and maintained at this temperature for 12 h, followed by active rewarming. Mild hypothermia significantly reduced cortical water content, decreased BBB permeability and attenuated TJ ultrastructural and basement membrane breakdown in brain cortical microvessels. Mild hypothermia also attenuated the CPR-induced decreases in TJ (occludin, claudin-5, ZO-1) and AJ (VE-cadherin) protein and mRNA expression. Furthermore, mild hypothermia decreased the CA- and CPR-induced increases in matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and increased angiogenin-1 (Ang-1) expression. Our findings suggest that mild hypothermia attenuates the CA- and resuscitation-induced early brain oedema and BBB disruption, and this improvement might be at least partially associated with attenuation of the breakdown of TJ and AJ, suppression of MMP-9 and VEGF expression, and upregulation of Ang-1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2598200020,"Hepatic steatosis renders liver more vulnerable to ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), which commonly occurs in transplantation, trauma, and liver resection. The underlying mechanism is not fully characterized. We aimed to clarify the role of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (HIRI) in normal and steatotic liver using Alb-TSC1-/- (AT) and Alb-mTOR-/- (Am) transgenic mice. Steatotic liver induced by high-fat diet was more vulnerable to IRI. Activation of hepatic mTOR in AT mice decreased lipid accumulation attenuated HIRI as measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining, circulating levels of alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase, and inflammatory mediators such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), TNF-α, and IL-6 and hepatic cleaved caspase 3 in mice fed either a normal chow diet or a high-fat diet. The effects of mTOR activation on hepatic cleaved caspase 3 were reversed by rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR signaling. Inhibition of hepatic mTOR in Am mice increased hepatic lipid deposition and HIRI. The increment in hepatic susceptibility to IRI was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with IKKβ inhibitor. Further, suppression of mTOR facilitated nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. In conclusion, our study suggests that mTOR activity in hepatocytes decreases hepatic vulnerability to injury through a mechanism dependent on NF-κB proinflammatory cytokine signaling pathway in both normal and steatotic liver.-Li, Z., Zhang, J., Mulholland, M., Zhang, W. mTOR activation protects liver from ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury through NF-κB pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2599047111,"Digital imaging of H&E stained slides has enabled the application of image processing to support pathology workflows. Potential applications include computer-aided diagnostics, advanced quantification tools, and innovative visualization platforms. However, the intrinsic variability of biological tissue and the vast differences in tissue preparation protocols often lead to significant image variability that can hamper the effectiveness of these computational tools. We developed an alternative representation for H&E images that operates within a space that is more amenable to many of these image processing tools. The algorithm to derive this representation operates by exploiting the correlation between color and the spatial properties of the biological structures present in most H&E images. In this way, images are transformed into a structure-centric space in which images are segregated into tissue structure channels. We demonstrate that this framework can be extended to achieve color normalization, effectively reducing inter-slide variability."
https://openalex.org/W2603938437,"Alterations of species phenology in response to climate change are now unquestionable. Until now, most studies have reported precocious occurrence of life cycle events as a major phenological response. Desynchronizations of biotic interactions, in particular predator-prey relationships, are however assumed to strongly impact ecosystems’ functioning, as formalized by the Match-Mismatch Hypothesis (MMH). Temporal synchronicity between juvenile fish and zooplankton in estuaries is therefore of essential interest since estuaries are major nursery grounds for many commercial fish species. The Gironde estuary (SW France) has suffered significant alterations over the last three decades, including two Abrupt Ecosystem Shifts (AES), and three contrasted intershift periods. The main objective of this study was to depict modifications in fish and zooplankton phenology among inter-shift periods and discuss the potential effects of the resulting mismatches at a community scale. A flexible Bayesian method was used to estimate and compare yearly patterns of species abundance in the estuary among the three pre-defined periods. Results highlighted (1) an earlier peak of zooplankton production and entrance of fish species in the estuary and (2) a decrease in residence time of both groups in the estuary. Such species-specific phenological changes led to changes in temporal overlap between juvenile fish and their zooplanktonic prey. This situation questions the efficiency and potentially the viability of nursery function of the Gironde estuary, with potential implications for coastal marine fisheries of the Bay of Biscay."
https://openalex.org/W2600482067,"There is an unambiguous association of Streptococcus gallolyticus infection with colorectal cancer, although there is limited information about epidemiology or interaction between molecular and environmental factors. We performed an original quantitative analysis of S. gallolyticus in unselected colorectal cancer patients (n = 190) and their association with clinical, pathological tumor molecular profiles (microsatellite instability, hypermethylator phenotype and chromosomal instability pathways), and other biological factors in colorectal tumor and normal tissues (cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus infection). We developed a new quantitative method to assess bacterial load. Analytical validation was reached with a very high sensitivity and specificity. Our results showed a 3.2% prevalence of S. gallolyticus infection in our unselected cohort of colorectal cancer cases (6/190). The average S. gallolyticus copy number was 7,018 (range 44–34,585). No previous reports relating to S. gallolyticus infection have been published for unselected cohorts of patients. Finally, and despite a low prevalence of S. gallolyticus in this study, we were able to define a specific association with tumor tissue (p = 0.03) and with coinfection with Epstein-Barr virus (p = 0.042; OR: 9.49; 95% IC: 1.1–82.9). The prevalence data provided will be very useful in the design of future studies, and will make it possible to estimate the sample size needed to assess precise objectives. In conclusion, our results show a low prevalence of S. gallolyticus infection in unselected colorectal cancer patients and an association of positive S. gallolyticus infection with tumor tissue and Epstein-Barr virus coinfection. Further studies will be needed to definitively assess the prevalence of S. gallolyticus in colorectal cancer and the associated clinicopathological and molecular profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2598551246,"Bacterial blight, which is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide. The development and use of disease-resistant cultivars have been the most effective strategy to control bacterial blight. Identifying the genes mediating bacterial blight resistance is a prerequisite for breeding cultivars with broad-spectrum and durable resistance. We herein describe a genome-wide association study involving 172 diverse Oryza sativa ssp. indica accessions to identify loci influencing the resistance to representative strains of six Xoo races. Twelve resistance loci containing 121 significantly associated signals were identified using 317,894 single nucleotide polymorphisms, which explained 13.3–59.9% of the variability in lesion length caused by Xoo races P1, P6, and P9a. Two hotspot regions (L11 and L12) were located within or nearby two cloned R genes (xa25 and Xa26) and one fine-mapped R gene (Xa4). Our results confirmed the relatively high resolution of genome-wide association studies. Moreover, we detected novel significant associations on chromosomes 2, 3, and 6–10. Haplotype analyses of xa25, the Xa26 paralog (MRKc; LOC_Os11g47290), and a Xa4 candidate gene (LOC_11g46870) revealed differences in bacterial blight resistance among indica subgroups. These differences were responsible for the observed variations in lesion lengths resulting from infections by Xoo races P1 and P9a. Our findings may be relevant for future studies involving bacterial blight resistance gene cloning, and provide insights into the genetic basis for bacterial blight resistance in indica rice, which may be useful for knowledge-based crop improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2603510443,"Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo pathway that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The MEK5/ERK5 MAPK cascade is essential for the early step of myogenesis. In this study, we generated C2C12 stable cell lines that expressed YAP (C2C12-YAP cells) and found that ERK5 and MEK5 were activated in C2C12-YAP cells compared with control C2C12 (C2C12-vector) cells. C2C12YAP stable cells also differentiated into myotubes better than C2C12-vector cells, and expressed elevated levels of myogenin, a transcription factor that regulates myogenesis, as well as elevated levels of myosin heavy chain, a skeletal muscle marker. Western blot analysis revealed that Src and c-Abl (Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1) activation were enhanced in C2C12-YAP cells. Conversely, treatment of inhibitors of c-Abl, Src, or MEK5 inhibited activation of MEK5 and ERK5 and myogenesis of C2C12 myoblasts. Specific interactions between YAP and proteins in the ERK5 pathway, such as MEK kinase 3 (MEKK3) and ERK5, were illustrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. MEKK3 contains the PPGY motif (aa 178–181), which may interact with YAP. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that expression of MEKK3 Y181F mutant inhibited MEK5/ERK5 activation and myogenic differentiation.

However, the specific role that vitamin D plays in MS still remains unknown. In order to identify potential mechanisms underlying vitamin D effects in MS, we profiled epigenetic changes in vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene to identify genomic regulatory elements relevant to MS pathogenesis. Methods Human T cells derived from whole blood by negative selection were isolated in a set of 23 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients and 12 controls matched by age and gender. DNA methylation levels were assessed by bisulfite cloning sequencing in two regulatory elements of VDR. mRNA levels were measured by RT-qPCR to assess changes in VDR expression between patients and controls. Results An alternative VDR promoter placed at exon 1c showed increased DNA methylation levels in RRMS patients (median 30.08%, interquartile range 19.2%) compared to controls (18.75%, 9.5%), p-value<0.05. Moreover, a 6.5-fold increase in VDR mRNA levels was found in RRMS patients compared to controls (p-value<0.001). Conclusions An alternative promoter of the VDR gene shows altered DNA methylation levels in patients with multiple sclerosis, and it is associated with VDR mRNA upregulation. This locus may represent a candidate regulatory element in the genome relevant to MS pathogenesis."

Using a combination of structural modeling and mutagenesis studies, we present here two modes of ligand-independent activation of GCGR. First, we identified a GCGR-specific hydrophobic lock comprising Met-338 and Phe-345 within the IC3 loop and transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) and found that this lock stabilizes the TM6 helix in the inactive conformation. Disruption of this hydrophobic lock led to constitutive G protein and arrestin signaling. Second, we discovered a polar core comprising conserved residues in TM2, TM3, TM6, and TM7, and mutations that disrupt this polar core led to constitutive GCGR activity. On the basis of these results, we propose a mechanistic model of GCGR activation in which TM6 is held in an inactive conformation by the conserved polar core and the hydrophobic lock. Mutations that disrupt these inhibitory elements allow TM6 to swing outward to adopt an active TM6 conformation similar to that of the canonical β2-adrenergic receptor complexed with G protein and to that of rhodopsin complexed with arrestin. Importantly, mutations in the corresponding polar core of several other members of class B GPCRs, including PTH1R, PAC1R, VIP1R, and CRFR1, also induce constitutive G protein signaling, suggesting that the rearrangement of the polar core is a conserved mechanism for class B GPCR activation.

https://openalex.org/W2599957764,"Background Patients with advanced diabetic kidney disease (DKD) behave differently to diabetic patients without kidney disease. We aimed to investigate the associations of hypoglycemia and outcomes after initiation of dialysis in patients with advanced DKD on dialysis. Methods Using National Health Insurance Research Database, 20,845 advanced DKD patients beginning long-term dialysis between 2002 and 2006 were enrolled. We investigated the incidence of severe hypoglycemia episodes before initiation of dialysis. Patients were followed from date of first dialysis to death, end of dialysis, or 2008. Main outcomes measured were all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and subsequent severe hypoglycemic episodes after dialysis. Results 19.18% patients had at least one hypoglycemia episode during 1-year period before initiation of dialysis. Advanced DKD patients with higher adapted Diabetes Complications Severity Index (aDCSI) scores were associated with more frequent hypoglycemia (P for trend < 0.001). Mortality and subsequent severe hypoglycemia after dialysis both increased with number of hypoglycemic episodes. Compared to those who had no hypoglycemic episodes, those who had one had a 15% higher risk of death and a 2.3-fold higher risk of subsequent severe hypoglycemia. Those with two or more episodes had a 19% higher risk of death and a 3.9-fold higher risk of subsequent severe hypoglycemia. However, previous severe hypoglycemia was not correlated with risk of MI after dialysis. Conclusions The rate of severe hypoglycemia was high in advanced DKD patients. Patients with higher aDCSI scores tended to have more hypoglycemic episodes. Hypoglycemic episodes were associated with subsequent hypoglycemia and mortality after initiation of dialysis. We studied the associations and further study is needed to establish cause. In addition, more attention is needed for hypoglycemia prevention in advanced DKD patients, especially for those at risk patients."

This gene family has been proposed to be involved in sucrose signaling. In the present study, we cloned three copies of the TaSnRK2.10 gene from bread wheat on chromosomes 4A, 4B and 4D. The coding sequence (CDS) is 1086 bp in length and encodes a protein of 361 amino acids that exhibits functional domains shared with SnRK2s. Based on the haplotypes of TaSnRK2.10-4A (Hap-4A-H and Hap-4A-L), a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker designated TaSnRK2.10-4A-CAPS was developed and mapped between the markers D-1092101 and D-100014232 using a set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs). The TaSnRK2.10-4B alleles (Hap-4B-G and Hap-4B-A) were transformed into allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) markers TaSnRK2.10-4B-AS1 and TaSnRK2.10-4B-AS2, which were located between the markers D-1281577 and S-1862758. No diversity was found for TaSnRK2.10-4D. An association analysis using a natural population consisting of 128 winter wheat varieties in multiple environments showed that the thousand grain weight (TGW) and spike length (SL) of Hap-4A-H were significantly higher than those of Hap-4A-L, but pant height (PH) was significantly lower."

Materials and methods We performed a retrospective descriptive study using the Hospitalization Minimum Data Set (CMBD). All CMBD’s hospital discharges with ICD-9 CM code 082.1 were analyzed. Hospitalization rates were calculated and clinical characteristics were described. Spatial distribution of cases and their temporal behavior were also assessed. Results A total of 4,735 hospitalizations with MSF diagnosis were recorded during the study period, out of which 62.2% were male, mean age of 48. Diabetes mellitus, alcohol dependence syndrome, and chronic liver disease occurred in 10.8%, 2.4% and 2.8% hospitalizations, respectively. The median annual hospitalization rate showed a decreasing trend from a maximum of 12.9 in 1997 to a minimum rate of 3.1 in 2014. Most admissions occurred during the summer, showing a significant annual seasonal behavior. Important regional differences were found. Discussion Although MSF hospitalization rates have decreased considerably, it remains a public health problem due to its severity and economic impact. Therefore, it would be desirable to improve its oversight and surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2599020160,"A complex interplay among host, pathogen, and environmental factors is believed to contribute to the risk of developing pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). The lack of replication of published genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings limits the clinical utility of reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We conducted a GWAS using 467 PTB cases and 1,313 healthy controls obtained from two community-based cohorts in Korea. We evaluated the performance of PTB risk models based on different combinations of genetic and nongenetic factors and validated the results in an independent Korean population comprised of 179 PTB cases and 500 healthy controls. We demonstrated the polygenic nature of PTB and nongenetic factors such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) were strongly associated with PTB risk. None of the SNPs achieved genome-wide significance; instead, we were able to replicate the associations between PTB and ten SNPs near or in the genes, CDCA7, GBE1, GADL1, SPATA16, C6orf118, KIAA1432, DMRT2, CTR9, CCDC67, and CDH13, which may play roles in the immune and inflammatory pathways. Among the replicated SNPs, an intergenic SNP, rs9365798, located downstream of the C6orf118 gene showed the most significant association under the dominant model (OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.32–1.92, P = 2.1×10−6). The performance of a risk model combining the effects of ten replicated SNPs and six nongenetic factors (i.e., age, sex, BMI, cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure, and hemoglobin) were validated in the replication set (AUC = 0.80, 95% CI 0.76–0.84). The strategy of combining genetic and nongenetic risk factors ultimately resulted in better risk prediction for PTB in the adult Korean population."
https://openalex.org/W2600862621,"Anticipation of opponent actions, through the use of advanced (i.e., pre-event) kinematic information, can be trained using video-based temporal occlusion. Typically, this involves isolated opponent skills/shots presented as trials in a random order. However, two different areas of research concerning representative task design and contextual (non-kinematic) information, suggest this structure of practice restricts expert performance. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a sequential structure of practice during video-based training of anticipatory behavior in tennis, as well as the transfer of these skills to the performance environment.In a pre-practice-retention-transfer design, participants viewed life-sized video of tennis rallies across practice in either a sequential order (sequential group), in which participants were exposed to opponent skills/shots in the order they occur in the sport, or a non-sequential (non-sequential group) random order.In the video-based retention test, the sequential group was significantly more accurate in their anticipatory judgments when the retention condition replicated the sequential structure compared to the non-sequential group. In the non-sequential retention condition, the non-sequential group was more accurate than the sequential group. In the field-based transfer test, overall decision time was significantly faster in the sequential group compared to the non-sequential group.Findings highlight the benefits of a sequential structure of practice for the transfer of anticipatory behavior in tennis. We discuss the role of contextual information, and the importance of representative task design, for the testing and training of perceptual-cognitive skills in sport."
https://openalex.org/W2603676090,"We measured the distribution of sugar solution within groups of caged honey bees (Apis mellifera) under standard in vitro laboratory conditions using 14C polyethylene glycol as a radioactive marker to analyze ingestion by individual bees after group feeding. We studied the impact of different experimental setups by varying the number of bees, age of bees, origin of bees, duration of experiment, the amount of available diet, and the influence of the neurotoxic pesticide imidacloprid in the diet on the feeding and food sharing behavior (trophallaxis). Sugar solution was non-uniformly distributed in bees in 36 out of 135 cages. As a measure of the extent to which the sugar diet was equally distributed between caged bees, we calculated the (inner 80%) intake ratio by dividing the intake of the 90th percentile bee by the intake of the 10th percentile bee. This intake ratio ranged from 1.3 to 94.8 in 133 individual cages, further supporting a non-uniform distribution of food among caged bees. We can expect a cage with 10 or 30 bees containing one bee that ingests, on average, the 8.8-fold of the bee in the same cage ingesting the smallest quantity of food. Inner 80% intake ratios were lower in experiments with a permanent or chronic offering of labelled sugar solution compared to temporary or acute feedings. After pooling the data of replicates to achieve a higher statistical power we compared different experimental setups. We found that uniform food distribution is best approached with 10 newly emerged bees per cage, which originate from a brood comb from a single colony. We also investigated the trophallaxis between caged honey bees which originally consumed the diet and newly added bees. Color marked bees were starved and added to the cages in a ratio of 10:5 or 20:20 after the initial set of bees consumed all the labelled sugar solution. The distribution of the labelled sugar solution by trophallaxis within 48 hours to added bees was 25% (10:5) or 45% (20:20) of the initial sugar solution. Imidacloprid at its median lethal dose (LD50) in the sugar solution reduced this post-feeding food transmission to 27% (20:20). Our results show that differences in food intake exist within caged bees that may lead to differential exposure that can influence the interpretation of toxicity tests."
https://openalex.org/W2597436798,"Each inherited retinal disorder is rare, but together, they affect millions of people worldwide. No treatment is currently available for these blinding diseases, but promising new options-including gene therapy-are emerging. Arguably, the most prevalent retinal dystrophy is Stargardt disease. In each case, the specific combination of ABCA4 variants (> 900 identified to date) and modifying factors is virtually unique. It accounts for the vast phenotypic heterogeneity including variable rates of functional and structural progression, thereby potentially limiting the ability of phase I/II clinical trials to assess efficacy of novel therapies with few patients. To accommodate this problem, we developed and validated a sensitive and reliable composite clinical trial endpoint for disease progression based on structural measurements of retinal degeneration.We used longitudinal data from early-onset Stargardt patients from the Netherlands (development cohort, n = 14) and the United Kingdom (external validation cohort, n = 18). The composite endpoint was derived from best-corrected visual acuity, fundus autofluorescence, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Weighting optimization techniques excluded visual acuity from the composite endpoint. After optimization, the endpoint outperformed each univariable outcome, and showed an average progression of 0.41° retinal eccentricity per year (95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.52). Comparing with actual longitudinal values, the model accurately predicted progression (R2, 0.904). These properties were largely preserved in the validation cohort (0.43°/year [0.33-0.53]; prediction: R2, 0.872). We subsequently ran a two-year trial simulation with the composite endpoint, which detected a 25% decrease in disease progression with 80% statistical power using only 14 patients.These results suggest that a multimodal endpoint, reflecting structural macular changes, provides a sensitive measurement of disease progression in Stargardt disease. It can be very useful in the evaluation of novel therapeutic modalities in rare disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2598566802,"Background Valvular heart diseases (VHD) is very common in clinical practice and has became the subject of growing attention in the field of cardiovascular medicine. Our aim was to assess the prevalence and correlates of VHD in the general population in Xinjiang, China. Methods Using a 4-stage stratified cluster random sampling method, a total of 14618 participants were recruited in the Cardiovascular Risk Survey (CRS) study. The participants’ personal information, medical history were assessed by questionnaire. VHD was diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography. We carried out the statistical analysis utilizing SPSS Statistics version 19.0. Results In the total study group, VHD was observed in 1397 (9.65%) individuals. The prevalence rates of VHD in Han, Uygur and Kazak group are 13.51%, 2.71% and 12.29% respectively. The prevalence rates of VHD increased strikingly with age (all P < 0.001). The results of multinomial regression analysis indicated that VHD were related to age in Han group, to age smoking and hypertension in Uygur group, to age and hypertension in Kazak group. Conclusion Our research provides a unique prevalence rate of VHD in Xinjiang natural population. The result suggests that VHD are notably common in this population (9.65%) and increase with age. There exists significant difference of prevalence rate between ethnics. The main risk factors of VHD are age, hypertension and smoking. Valvular heart diseases should be regarded as a serious and growing public-health problem."
https://openalex.org/W2598707244,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is one of the deadly gynecological malignancies. The function of protein kinase CK2α (CK2α) in EOC is still unknown. Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between the protein expression of CK2α and the tumor progression, the prognosis of human EOC. In this study, we analyzed the expression levels of CK2α through Western blot, using EOC cell lines like A2780, HO8910, COV644, OVCAR3, SKOV3, and the primary normal ovarian surface epithelial (NOSE) cells. Furthermore, OVCAR3 and SKOV3 EOC cells were employed as a cellular model to study the role of CK2α on cell growth, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and cell cycle distribution. In addition, we investigated CK2α protein expression in tumor tissues from patients with EOC by immunohistochemistry and analyzed the association between CK2α expression and clinicopathologic parameters and prognosis of EOC patients. And we found that compared with NOSE cells, CK2α protein expression was increased in A2780, HO8910, OVCAR3, and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines. Decreased CK2α expression suppressed OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cell growth and induced more apoptosis. CK2α knockdown using specific siRNAs inhibited migration and invasion ability of OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cells. In addition, high CK2α protein expression was found in 68.4% (80/117) of EOC patients. Increased CK2α expression of was significantly correlated with FIGO staging and peritoneal cytology. Patients with higher CK2α expression had a significantly poorer overall survival compared with those with lower CK2α expression. Multi-variate Cox regression analysis proved that increased CK2α expression was an independent prognostic marker for EOC. Taken together, our data displayed that CK2α may play a role in tumor aggressive behavior of EOC and could be used as a marker for predicting prognosis of EOC patient. High CK2α expression might predict poor patient survival."

Such a model predicts the existence of a stable ternary Mps2-Bbp1-Spc29 complex that may anchor additional SPIN components to the SPB. Here, we address the important question of how a structure like the SPB is embedded in the nuclear envelope. We show purification and characterization of the Mps2-Bbp1 complex and the importance of coiled-coil interactions between Mps2 and Bbp1 for complex formation. Using purified Spc29 and the Mps2-Bbp1 complex, we reconstituted a high molecular weight ternary Mps2-Bbp1-Spc29 complex. Moreover, our experiments indicate that Bbp1 has the ability to oligomerize Spc29. The high molecular weight Mps2-Bbp1-Spc29 complex may resemble an early step in SPB duplication leading to the formation of the satellite, a SPB precursor. The Mps2-Bbp1 complex also interacts with the purified Mps3 and Ndc1 proteins, suggesting that Mps2-Bbp1 has a key role in recruiting SPIN proteins to the periphery of the central plaque. In summary, SPIN components show multiple biochemical interactions that are likely important for the insertion of the new SPB into the nuclear envelope. Mps2 and Bbp1 are key mediators of the link between the nuclear envelope and the SPB because of their interactions with the integral membrane protein Mps3 and the central plaque component Spc29 (4Jaspersen S.L.

To understand how Mps2 and Bbp1 fulfill their central role in membrane insertion of the SPB, we purified both proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (32Hays F.A. Roe-Zurz Z. Stroud R.M. Overexpression and purification of integral membrane proteins in yeast.Methods Enzymol. 2010; 470: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The soluble His6-Mps2-(1–306) protein, comprising the cytoplasmic domain of Mps2, runs as a 304-kDa protein by gel filtration (supplemental Figs. S1, A and B). In contrast, Mps2-His10 that was purified in the presence of the detergent lauryl dimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO) had an apparent molecular mass of ∼436 kDa (calculated molecular mass of the monomer, 46.8 kDa) (supplemental Fig. S1C). Next, we co-overexpressed MPS2-His10 together with BBP1 in S. cerevisiae. To correct for different expression rates of MPS2-His10 and BBP1 and to ensure that most of the purified Mps2-His10 protein was in complex with Bbp1, we transformed S. cerevisiae cells simultaneously with the plasmids p423-GAL1-BBP1, p424-GAL1-BBP1, p425-GAL1-BBP1, and p426-GAL1-MPS2-His10 and subsequently induced the GAL1 promoter by the addition of galactose (supplemental Fig. S2A). We purified the Mps2-His10-Bbp1 complex by Ni-NTA purification and gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1, A–C). Mps2-His10 and Bbp1 co-eluted at 11.89–11.91 ml from the Superose 6 column in LDAO containing buffer (Fig. 1, A and E), whereas Mps2-His10 eluted at a larger volume (Fig. 1C; 13.39 ml). The elution volume of the Mps2-Bbp1 complex was unaffected when cells expressed an excess of MPS2 over BBP1 (supplemental Fig. S2A; GAL1-MPS2-His10 GAL1-BBP1 cells), suggesting a stable complex stoichiometry. Based on intensity measurements of the Coomassie Blue-stained bands, we estimated a molar ratio of 1.7 for Mps2 and Bbp1 in the complex (Fig. 1, A and B). Mass spectrometry of the Mps2-His10-Bbp1 complex showed that S232 of Mps2, which is located between the two coiled-coil domains, was phosphorylated (supplemental Fig. S2B; compare Ref. 33Keck J.M. Jones M.H. Wong C.C. Binkley J. Chen D. Jaspersen S.L. Holinger E.P. Xu T. Niepel M. Rout M.P. Vogel J. Sidow A. Yates 3rd, J.R. Winey M. A cell cycle phosphoproteome of the yeast centrosome.Science. 2011; 332: 1557-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of Mps2 and Bbp1 was not required for complex formation as the Mps2-Bbp1 complex also assembled in Escherichia coli (supplemental Fig. S2C). The purified Mps2-His10-Bbp1 complex (and as a control, Mps2-His10) was reconstituted into liposomes by rapid dilution of the detergent (Fig. 1D). Mps2 and Bbp1 co-migrated with the fluorescently labeled liposomes in Nycodenz gradients. The formation of Mps2-Bbp1 proteoliposomes proved that Mps2-Bbp1 was indeed a stable membrane protein complex. To test whether Mps2 and Bbp1 are capable of forming complexes without the help of additional factors, separately purified Bbp1-His10 (supplemental Fig. S2D) and Mps2-His10 proteins were used for complex reconstitution (Fig. 1E). Formation of the Mps2-His10-Bbp1-His10 complex was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. Similar to the purified Mps2-His10-Bbp1 complex (Fig. 1E, bottom panel; 11.91 ml, corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of ∼1 MDa), in vitro assembled Mps2-His10-Bbp1-His10 complex was detected at an elution volume of 12.24 ml. In addition, a high molecular weight Mps2-His10-Bbp1-His10 complex (elution volume of 7.84 ml) eluted close to the void volume of the column (Fig. 1E, top, ∼7.5–7.7 ml). Thus, Bbp1 and Mps2 assemble in vitro into stable medium and high size molecular weight complexes. It has been shown that Bbp1 and Mps2 each contain two different coiled-coil domains: self-associating, homotypic ones for Bbp1-Bbp1 and Mps2-Mps2 homo-dimer formation and heterotypic coiled-coil interactions that allow assembly of Mps2-Bbp1 (Ref, 11Zizlsperger N. Keating A.E. Specific coiled-coil interactions contribute to a global model of the structure of the spindle pole body.J. Struct. Biol. 2010; 170: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar; compare supplemental Fig. S1A). We asked if this hetero-association of coiled-coil domains is indeed the reason for Mps2-Bbp1 complex formation. The elution volume of Mps2 and Mps2-His10-Bbp1 in gel filtration experiments depended on the detergent type. If Fos-choline-12 (Fos12, n-dodecylphospho-choline) was used, the apparent molecular mass of Mps2-His10 was 215 kDa and not 419 kDa, as was the case in LDAO-containing buffer (Fig. 2A, top panel). This suggests dissociation of Mps2-Mps2 homo-assemblies by Fos12. In addition, although an Mps2-Bbp1 complex with an apparent molecular mass of more than 600 kDa was detectable in the presence of LDAO (Fig. 2B, bottom panel, M-B), this complex was absent when Fos12 was used (Fig. 2, A and B). The outcome of Fig. 2, A and B, led to the idea that Fos12 destabilizes certain types of coiled-coil interactions. To test this model, we purified the C-terminal soluble fragment of SPIN component Nbp1 Nbp1-(174–319) that homo-dimerizes via coiled-coil interactions (11Zizlsperger N. Keating A.E. Specific coiled-coil interactions contribute to a global model of the structure of the spindle pole body.J. Struct. Biol. 2010; 170: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As a control, we used the Nbp1-(220–319) fragment lacking the coiled-coil region (Fig. 2C). In the absence of detergent, Nbp1-(220–319)-sfGFP-His6 eluted at an apparent molecular mass of ∼74 kDa, whereas the corresponding Nbp1 fragment with the coiled-coil region (Nbp1-(174–319)-sfGFP-His6) run at 188 kDa, confirming the homo-dimerization of Nbp1 by coiled-coil interactions. We next analyzed Nbp1 fragments in the presence of either n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) or Fos12. The apparent molecular mass of Nbp1-(174–319)-sfGFP-His6 changed from 257 kDa to 116 kDa when DDM was exchanged for Fos12, whereas sfGFP-His6 and Nbp1-(220–319)-sfGFP-His6 remained unaffected by this detergent change. We concluded that Fos12 disrupts homotypic coiled-coil interactions of the Bbp1-Mps2 complex and, therefore, dissociates Bbp1-Bbp1 and Mps2-Mps2 binding. Purification of the Mps2-Bbp1 complex in the presence of LDAO with subsequent addition of Fos12 triggered partial disassembly of the Mps2-Bbp1 complex (Fig. 2D). It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that Fos12 also disrupts heterotypic coiled-coil interactions between Mps2 and Bbp1. The inner nuclear membrane protein Mps3 is a member of the SUN protein family (supplemental Fig. S3A; Ref. 4Jaspersen S.L. Martin A.E. Glazko G. Giddings Jr, T.H. Morgan G. Mushegian A. Winey M. The Sad1-UNC-84 homology domain in Mps3 interacts with Mps2 to connect the spindle pole body with the nuclear envelope.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and one of the components of the SPB half-bridge. Purified Mps3 from yeast was found in a complex with histone (34Gardner J.M. Smoyer C.J. Stensrud E.S. Alexander R. Gogol M. Wiegraebe W. Jaspersen S.L. Targeting of the SUN protein Mps3 to the inner nuclear membrane by the histone variant H2A.Z.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 489-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and ribosomal proteins (supplemental Fig. S3B) and could be reconstituted into liposomes (supplemental Fig. S3C). We next confirmed Mps3-Mps2 complex formation by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3, A–C). The same approach was used to reconstitute an Mps3-Mps2-Bbp1 complex (Fig. 3, D–G). Using DDM as detergent, Mps2-Bbp1 was eluted in two complexes from the Superose 6 column (Figs. 3, F and G, and supplemental Fig. S6; a “high molecular weight complex” eluting next to the void volume of the column and the “medium molecular weight” complex eluting as seen with LDAO at ∼12 ml). Adding Mps3 in molar excess to Mps2-Bbp1 led to a shift of the elution volume of both Mps2-Bbp1 complexes (Fig. 3, E and G). The formation of the Mps3-Mps2-Bbp1 complex became visible as an increase of the Mps2, Bbp1, and Mps3 blot signal intensities at an elution volume from ∼8 to 10 ml (Fig. 3, E and G). Thus, Mps3 forms a stable complex with Mps2-Bbp1. To understand the function of Ndc1 in anchoring SPBs and NPCs to the nuclear envelope in more detail, characterization of Ndc1 was of special importance. We solubilized Ndc1-His10 and Ndc1-sfGFP-His10 with detergent (Figs. 4A and supplemental Fig. S3D) and demonstrated that the purified proteins could be reconstituted into liposomes (Fig. 4B). We next focused on the interaction of Ndc1 with Bbp1. NDC1-His10 and untagged BBP1 were co-overexpressed in yeast (Fig. 4C). Surprisingly, Bbp1 co-eluted with Ndc1 from the Ni-NTA column, whereas in the absence of Ndc1 there was only an unspecific interaction of Bbp1 with the Ni-NTA beads (Fig. 4C, Bbp1 immunoblots). Interestingly, traces of Mps2 co-eluted with Ndc1 and Bbp1 (MPS2 was not overexpressed in this experiment), indicating the presence of Ndc1-Bbp1-Mps2 interactions. The interaction between Ndc1 and Bbp1 is probably weak as Bbp1 was copurified in the amounts substoichiometric to Ndc1. Our data support the idea that Ndc1, Mps2, and Bbp1 form a network of membrane-associated proteins that may be crucial for SPB membrane insertion. The central plaque protein Spc29 contains a coiled-coil domain (residues 7–45) that does not homo-associate in isolation. In addition, Spc29 carries a second, strongly self-associating coiled-coil region (residues 129–174) that likely forms homo-trimers (35Zizlsperger N. Malashkevich V.N. Pillay S. Keating A.E. Analysis of coiled-coil interactions between core proteins of the spindle pole body.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11858-11868Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that Bbp1 interacts with Spc29 in pull down experiments (31Araki Y. Gombos L. Migueleti S.P. Sivashanmugam L. Antony C. Schiebel E. N-terminal regions of Mps1 kinase determine functional bifurcation.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 189: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and an interaction between both proteins has been implicated based on yeast two-hybrid data (10Schramm C. Elliott S. Shevchenko A. Schiebel E. The Bbp1p-Mps2p complex connects the SPB to the nuclear envelope and is essential for SPB duplication.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To gain more insights into the interaction of Spc29 with Bbp1 and with the Mps2-Bbp1 membrane protein complex, we purified full-length His-sfGFP-Spc29 from yeast (Fig. 5, A and B) in the presence of RNase A to remove RNA, which otherwise co-purified with Spc29 (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). The reason for this co-purification of Spc29 with RNA is presently unknown and requires further investigation. Reconstitution of the Spc29-Bbp1 complex was achieved by incubating Bbp1–10His with a molar excess of His-sfGFP-Spc29. Formation of the complex was indicated by gel filtration (apparent molecular mass of ∼4 MDa; Fig. 5, B and C). We ensured in control experiments that the single proteins did not form higher homo-oligomers. Our model suggests that interaction of Mps2-Bbp1 with Spc29 anchors the core structure of the SPB in the nuclear envelope. This predicts the existence of the ternary Mps2-Bbp1-Spc29 complex. In a first experiment we observed that at a low detergent concentration His-Mps2-(1–306) (a soluble protein lacking the transmembrane domain), which was purified from E. coli (supplemental Fig. S1B), Bbp1-His and His-sfGFP-Spc29 co-precipitated, indicating the formation of large oligomeric complexes (Fig. 5D). At 0.1% LDAO, soluble ternary Mps2-(1–306)-Bbp1-Spc29 complex assembled (supplemental Fig. S4, C–F). We next reconstituted the Mps2-Bbp1-Spc29 complex from purified Mps2-Bbp1 and Spc29 in DDM-containing buffer (Fig. 6, A–D). The medium molecular weight Mps2-Bbp1 complex (which is also in DDM-containing buffer the main species if the Mps2-Bbp1 complex concentration is low; Fig. 6, B and D) was incubated with a molar excess of Spc29. This promoted formation of a Mps2-Bbp1-Spc29 complex eluting at 7.5 ml within the void volume of the Superose 6 column (Fig. 6, B–D). Interestingly, incubation of Spc29 with Mps2-Bbp1 not only led to formation of the ternary Mps2-Bbp1-Spc29 complex but also to homo-oligomeric Spc29 complexes eluting between ∼9.0 to ∼14 ml (Fig. 6, B, middle chromatogram, and D), thus at a higher apparent molecular weight than only Spc29. In contrast, no Spc29 was eluted in the analyzed range between 7.14 and 12.74 ml in the absence of Mps2-Bbp1 (Fig. 6D, bottom panel). These data suggest that the Mps2-Bbp1 complex induces oligomerization of Spc29 without being part of the Spc29 oligomeres. Spc29 oligomeriz"

Inducing robust differentiation would be necessary for improving the efficacy of the regenerative cardiac cell therapy. We assessed the hypothesis that differentiation of human c-kit+ CPCs can be enhanced by priming them with cardiac transcription factors (TFs). We introduced five different TFs (Gata4, MEF2C, NKX2.5, TBX5, and BAF60C) into CPCs, either alone or in combination, and then examined the expression of marker genes associated with the major cardiac cell types using quantitative RT-PCR. When introduced individually, Gata4 and TBX5 induced a subset of myocyte markers. Moreover, Gata4 alone significantly induced smooth muscle cell and fibroblast markers. Interestingly, these gene expression changes brought by Gata4 were also accompanied by morphological changes. In contrast, MEF2C and NKX2.5 were largely ineffective in initiating cardiac gene expression in CPCs. Surprisingly, introduction of multiple TFs in different combinations mostly failed to act synergistically. Likewise, addition of BAF60C to Gata4 and/or TBX5 did not further potentiate their effects on cardiac gene expression. Based on our results, it appears that GATA4 is able to potentiate gene expression programs associated with multiple cardiovascular lineages in CPCs, suggesting that GATA4 may be effective in priming CPCs for enhanced differentiation in the setting of stem cell therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2602780901,"The karyopherin transportin SR2 (TRN-SR2, TNPO3) is responsible for shuttling specific cargoes such as serine/arginine-rich splicing factors from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This protein plays a key role in HIV infection by facilitating the nuclear import of the pre-integration complex (PIC) that contains the viral DNA as well as several cellular and HIV proteins, including the integrase. The process of nuclear import is considered to be the bottleneck of the viral replication cycle and therefore represents a promising target for anti-HIV drug design. Previous studies have demonstrated that the direct interaction between TRN-SR2 and HIV integrase predominantly involves the catalytic core domain (CCD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the integrase. We aimed at providing a detailed molecular view of this interaction through a biochemical characterization of the respective protein complex. Size-exclusion chromatography was used to characterize the interaction of TRN-SR2 with a truncated variant of the HIV-1 integrase, including both the CCD and CTD. These experiments indicate that one TRN-SR2 molecule can specifically bind one CCD-CTD dimer. Next, the regions of the solenoid-like TRN-SR2 molecule that are involved in the interaction with integrase were identified using AlphaScreen binding assays, revealing that the integrase interacts with the N-terminal half of TRN-SR2 principally through the HEAT repeats 4, 10, and 11. Combining these results with small-angle X-ray scattering data for the complex of TRN-SR2 with truncated integrase, we propose a molecular model of the complex. We speculate that nuclear import of the PIC may proceed concurrently with the normal nuclear transport.

We speculate that nuclear import of the PIC may proceed concurrently with the normal nuclear transport. During the last decades our understanding of HIV infection has considerably increased, and a wide range of drugs targeting different steps of the viral replication cycle has been developed. However, the current combination anti-retroviral therapy has significant limitations such as the inability to completely eradicate the virus, the emergence of drug-resistant strains, adverse effects, and high cost. For these reasons, the development of new anti-HIV drugs is still necessary (1Engelman A. Cherepanov P. The structural biology of HIV-1: mechanistic and therapeutic insights.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). HIV, a member of the superfamily Retroviridae, can infect both dividing and non-dividing cells (2Yamashita M. Emerman M. Retroviral infection of non-dividing cells: old and new perspectives.Virology. 2006; 344: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Unlike other retroviruses, such as Gammaretroviruses, which make use of mitosis to gain access to chromatin, HIV enters the nucleus in the form of the pre-integration complex (PIC) 2The abbreviations used are: PICpre-integration complexCTDC-terminal domainCCDcatalytic core domainPDBProtein Data BankSAXSsmall-angle X-ray scatteringSECsize-exclusion chromatographyHEATHuntington, Elongation Factor 3, PR65/A, TORNi2+-NTANi2+-nitrilotriacetic acidINintegraseSUMOsmall ubiquitin-like modifier. by means of an active transport through the nuclear pore (3Lusic M. Siliciano R.F. Nuclear landscape of HIV-1 infection and integration.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 10.1038/nrmicro.2017.22PubMed Google Scholar). The PIC contains several components, including the reverse-transcribed viral genome, a number of viral proteins such as matrix, nucleocapsid, capsid, viral protein R, and integrase (IN), as well as cellular co-factors. Activity of IN is essential for the proliferation of the virus, as this enzyme catalyzes the irreversible incorporation of the viral DNA into the host genome. IN belongs to the superfamily of DDE(D) nucleotidyltransferases (4Cherepanov P. Maertens G.N. Hare S. Structural insights into the retroviral DNA integration apparatus.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2011; 21: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The enzyme contains three domains, the N-terminal domain, the catalytic core domain (CCD), and the C-terminal domain (CTD), all implicated in multimerization that is essential for the integration process. IN recognizes the blunt ends of the linearized double-stranded and reverse-transcribed viral DNA, resulting in a complex called the intasome (5Hare S. Maertens G.N.

TRN-SR2 consists of 20 consecutive Huntington, Elongation Factor 3, PR65/A, TOR (HEAT) repeats.

Within each HEAT, the helix a is located on the outside and helix b on the inside of the solenoid. It has been established that TRN-SR2 binds the substrate in the cytoplasmic compartment and subsequently docks to the nuclear pore complex, which enables its transport across the nuclear envelope. Nup358, a pivotal component of the nuclear pore complex located at the cytoplasmic side, has recently been attributed a role in transportin-mediated nuclear import (38Hutten S. Wälde S. Spillner C.

Once the TRN-SR2-based cargo complex reaches the nucleus, it interacts with Ras-related nuclear protein (Ran), the main regulatory co-factor of this machinery. A high nuclear concentration of RanGTP is maintained by the regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1) and the nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2). The competitive binding of GTP-charged Ran induces cargo release (34Bono F. Cook A.G. Grünwald M. Ebert J. Conti E.

Previous mutagenesis and structural studies have shown that TRN-SR2 binds RanGTP via the N-terminal region, whereas the cargo attachment typically requires the arginine-rich helix 15b of TRN-SR2 (28Maertens G.N.

The TRN-SR2·RanGTP complex eventually returns to the cytoplasm where the RanGTPase-activating protein (RanGAP) together with the Ran-binding protein 1 (RanBP1) lead to the GTP hydrolysis of Ran, which in turn induces its release from TRN-SR2 (39Fried H. Kutay U. Nucleocytoplasmic transport: taking an inventory.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). It was shown that, just like bona fide cargoes, HIV IN can be displaced from TRN-SR2 upon addition of RanGTP (40Taltynov O. Demeulemeester J. Christ F. De Houwer S. Tsirkone V.G. Gerard M. Weeks S.D.

Although viral proteins generally mutate quickly especially due to the error-prone activity of the reverse transcriptase, the interfaces between the viral and host proteins may not change considerably because the host proteins are practically invariable. Correspondingly, drugs targeting the virus/host interactions are much less likely to induce the selection of resistant strains. Fortunately, a number of interactions between HIV components and cellular factors have been discovered recently opening up new opportunities for the development of novel classes of antiretroviral agents (10Brass A.L.

Detailed understanding of the interaction between HIV IN and human TRN-SR2 at the molecular level is crucial toward a rational design of drugs that would target this interaction, which could lead to potent antivirals due to the bottleneck nature of HIV nuclear import. Despite its importance, the complex formation between HIV IN and human TRN-SR2 has not yet been characterized in detail at the biochemical level. One reason is that the full-length IN progressively oligomerizes in solution to a variable extent (44Guiot E. Carayon K. Delelis O. Simon F. Tauc P. Zubin E. Gottikh M. Mouscadet J.F. Brochon J.C.

Oligomeric states of the HIV-1 integrase as measured by time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9275-9284Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), complicating quantitative in vitro studies. However, it was established previously that the interaction between TRN-SR2 and IN predominantly occurs via the CCD and CTD domains of the latter (21De Houwer S. Demeulemeester J. Thys W. Taltynov O. Zmajkovicova K. Christ F. Debyser Z. Identification of residues in the C-terminal domain of HIV-1 integrase that mediate binding to the transportin-SR2 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 34059-34068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Accordingly, next to the full-length protein, in this study we have employed an N-terminal truncation variant of integrase that includes the CCD and CTD domains. This variant forms dimers in solution (46Chen J.C. Krucinski J. Miercke L.J. Finer-Moore J.S. Tang A.H. Leavitt A.D. Stroud R.M. Crystal structure of the HIV-1 integrase catalytic core and C-terminal domains: a model for viral DNA binding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 8233-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We have exploited size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) to investigate the interaction of TRN-SR2 with the CCD-CTD tandem and established the stoichiometry of the resulting complex. To pinpoint the specific interaction sites, we have used AlphaScreen binding assays involving the integrase and different truncated constructs of TRN-SR2 as well as short helical peptides thereof. Finally, we have employed small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to analyze the interaction between TRN-SR2 and IN in solution, which has yielded a 3D model of this molecular complex. We used an efficient expression and purification scheme based on producing the proteins of interest as His6-tagged small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) fusions (47Weeks S.D. Drinker M. Loll P.J. Ligation independent cloning vectors for expression of SUMO fusions.Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 53: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), followed by subtractive immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and removal of the purification tag. Samples of highly pure recombinant human TRN-SR2 (103.9 kDa) as well as HIV-1 IN CCD-CTD tandem (24.7 kDa) could be obtained. We then used analytical SEC to systematically analyze the formation of the respective protein complex. The TRN-SR2 sample was run alone and pre-incubated with CCD-CTD in increasing molar ratios (1:1, 1:2, and 1:3). All runs reveal a single dominant peak that is increasing in intensity and somewhat shifting to the left as more CCD-CTD is being added (Fig. 1a). The elution position of the main peak obtained with a 2-fold excess of CCD-CTD corresponds to ∼158 kDa according to a calibration by standard proteins, which is in good agreement with the theoretical value for the 1:2 complex (153 kDa). Moreover, although the mixtures containing a 1- or 2-fold molar excess of CCD-CTD do not show additional peaks in the chromatogram, the mixture with a 3-fold excess (as well as mixtures containing yet larger quantities of CCD-CTD, data not shown) reveals a distinct second peak at ∼44 kDa, which corresponds to the uncomplexed CCD-CTD dimer. In line with this, for the 1:1 and 1:2 mixtures, electrophoretic analysis of the peak fraction reveals the same mass ratios of the two proteins as input, whereas for the 1:3 mix the peak fraction still appears close to the 1:2 ratio (Fig. 1b). Taking these observations together, we suggest that TRN-SR2 is strongly binding CCD-CTD in a 1:2 molar ratio. With a large excess of CCD-CTD, some further weak and presumably nonspecific binding is also possible. In addition, we have used the same SEC setup to analyze the mixtures of TRN-SR2 with an IN construct, including the CTD domain only. These experiments (data not shown) have confirmed also that the isolated CTD binds to TRN-SR2. Previous studies have shown that the interaction between TRN-SR2 and IN predominantly occurs via the CTD of integrase, although the CCD is involved to a lesser extent (21De Houwer S. Demeulemeester J. Thys W. Taltynov O. Zmajkovicova K. Christ F. Debyser Z. Identification of residues in the C-terminal domain of HIV-1 integrase that mediate binding to the transportin-SR2 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 34059-34068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, it remained obscure which parts of TRN-SR2 are responsible for the interaction with IN. Here, we have used the AlphaScreen methodology to systematically address this question. For the initial mapping, we have prepared three consecutive fragments of TRN-SR2 each corresponding to roughly one-third of the solenoid-like molecule's length. These fragments are composed of residues 1–281, i.e. HEATs 1–6 and the first helix of HEAT 7 (helix 7a), residues 281–531, i.e. helix 7b and HEATs 8–12, and residues 531–923, i.e. HEATs 13–20, respectively. The two former fragments include the regions involved in the binding of RanGTP (37Tsirkone V.G. Beutels K.G. Demeulemeester J. Debyser Z. Christ F. Strelkov S.V.

https://openalex.org/W2603565390,"Dental Mesenchymal Cells (DMCs) are known to play a role in tooth development as well as in the repair and regeneration of dental tissue. A large number of signaling molecules regulate the proliferation and differentiation of DMC, though the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Sirtuin-6 (SIRT6), a key regulator of aging, can exert an impact on embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. The experimental deletion of Sirt6 in mouse bone marrow cells has been found to have an inhibiting impact on the bone mineral density and the osteogenic differentiation of these cells. The possible role of Sirt6 in tooth development, however, has at present remained largely unexplored. In the present study, we found that SIRT6 had no effect on tooth development before birth. However, Sirt6 gene deletion in knockout mice did have two post-natal impacts: a delay in tooth eruption and sluggishness in the development of dental roots. We propose an explanation of the possible molecular basis of the changes observed in Sirt6-/- mice. SIRT6 is expressed in mouse odontoblasts. Sirt6 deletion enhanced the proliferation of DMCs, as well as their capacity for adipogenic differentiation. On the other hand, it inhibited their capacity for in vitro osteogenic/chondrogenic differentiation. Further studies suggested that other factors may mediate the role of Sirt6 in odontogenesis. These include the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK), extracellular regulated MAP kinase (ERK) pathways and the mitochondrial energy. We demonstrated that Sirt6 plays a role in tooth root formation and confirmed that SIRT6 is necessary for DMC differentiation as well as for the development of the tooth root and for eventual tooth eruption. These results establish a new link between SIRT6 and tooth development."
https://openalex.org/W2599426874,"In response to climate warming, a southward shift in productive frontal systems serving as the main foraging sites for many top predator species is likely to occur in Subantarctic areas. Central place foragers, such as seabirds and pinnipeds, are thus likely to cope with an increase in the distance between foraging locations and their land-based breeding colonies. Understanding how central place foragers should modify their foraging behavior in response to changes in prey accessibility appears crucial. A spatially explicit individual-based simulation model (Marine Central Place Forager Simulator (MarCPFS)), including bio-energetic components, was built to evaluate effects of possible changes in prey resources accessibility on individual performances and breeding success. The study was calibrated on a particular example: the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), which alternates between oceanic areas in which females feed and the land-based colony in which they suckle their young over a 120 days rearing period. Our model shows the importance of the distance covered to feed and prey aggregation which appeared to be key factors to which animals are highly sensitive. Memorization and learning abilities also appear to be essential breeding success traits. Females were found to be most successful for intermediate levels of prey aggregation and short distance to the resource, resulting in optimal female body length. Increased distance to resources due to climate warming should hinder pups’ growth and survival while female body length should increase."

RP-UHPLC-UV-MSn was used for the tentative annotation and quantification of the prenylated products. Flavonoids, isoflavonoids and stilbenoids with different types of substitution were prenylated by SrCloQ, although with less efficiency than the genuine substrate 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The isoflavan equol, followed by the flavone 7,4'-dihydroxyflavone, were the best non-genuine acceptor substrates. B-ring C-prenylation was in general preferred over A-ring C-prenylation (ratio 5:1). Docking studies of non-genuine acceptor substrates with the B-ring oriented towards the donor substrate dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, showed that the carbonyl group of the C-ring was able to make stabilizing interactions with the residue Arg160, which might determine the preference observed for B-ring prenylation. No reaction products were formed when the acceptor substrate had no phenolic hydroxyl groups. This preference can be explained by the essential hydrogen bond needed between a phenolic hydroxyl group and the residue Glu281. Acceptor substrates with an additional hydroxyl group at the C3' position (B-ring), were mainly O3'-prenylated (> 80% of the reaction products). This can be explained by the proximity of the C3' hydroxyl group to the donor substrate at the catalytic site. Flavones were preferred over isoflavones by SrCloQ. Docking studies suggested that the orientation of the B-ring and of the phenolic hydroxyl group at position C7 (A-ring) of flavones towards the residue Tyr233 plays an important role in this observed preference. Finally, the insights obtained on acceptor substrate specificity and regioselectivity for SrCloQ were extended to other prenyltransferases from the CloQ/NhpB family."
https://openalex.org/W2597417632,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE) has anti-atherosclerotic properties, being involved in the transport and clearance of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins as well as in cholesterol efflux from cells. We hypothesized that glucocorticoids may exert anti-inflammatory properties by increasing the level of macrophage-derived apoE. Our data showed that glucocorticoids increased apoE expression in macrophages in vitro as well as in vivo. Dexamethasone increased ~6 fold apoE mRNA levels in cultured peritoneal macrophages and RAW 264.7 cells. Administered to C57BL/6J mice, dexamethasone induced a two-fold increase in apoE expression in peritoneal macrophages. By contrast, glucocorticoids did not influence apoE expression in hepatocytes, in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, dexamethasone enhanced apoE promoter transcriptional activity in RAW 264.7 macrophages, but not in HepG2 cells, as tested by transient transfections. Analysis of apoE proximal promoter deletion mutants, complemented by protein-DNA interaction assays demonstrated the functionality of a putative glucocorticoid receptors (GR) binding site predicted by in silico analysis in the -111/-104 region of the human apoE promoter. In hepatocytes, GR can bind to their specific site within apoE promoter but are not able to modulate the gene expression. The modulatory blockade in hepatocytes is a consequence of partial involvement of transcription factors and other signaling molecules activated through MEK1/2 and PLA2/PLC pathways. In conclusion, our study indicates that glucocorticoids (1) differentially target apoE gene expression; (2) induce a significant increase in apoE level specifically in macrophages. The local increase of apoE gene expression in macrophages at the level of the atheromatous plaque may have therapeutic implications in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2600369338,"Living closely with others can provide a myriad of fitness benefits, from shared territory defense to co-operative resource acquisition. Costs of social aggregation are not absent, however, and likely influence optimal and observed groups' sizes in a social species. Here, we explored optimal group size in a joint-nesting cuckoo species (the Smooth-billed Ani, Crotophaga ani) using endocrine markers of stress physiology (corticosterone, or CORT). Smooth-billed Anis exhibit intense reproductive competition that is exacerbated in atypically large groups. We therefore hypothesized that intra-group competition (measured by social group size) mediates the desirability and physiological cost of social group membership in this species. To test this hypothesis, we captured 47 adult Smooth-billed Anis (31 males, 16 females) during the breeding seasons of 2012-2014 in south-western Puerto Rico, and documented social group sizes. Tail feathers were sampled and used to quantify CORT (pg/mg) in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (n = 50). Our analyses show significant differences in feather-CORT of adults between categorical group sizes, with individuals from atypically large social groups (≥ x + 1SD) having highest mean concentrations (33.319 pg/mg), and individuals from atypically small social groups (≤ x - 1SD) having lowest mean concentrations (8.969 pg/mg). Whether reproductive competition or effort is responsible for elevated CORT in atypically large social groups, however, remains unclear. Our results suggest that living in atypically large groups is physiologically expensive and may represent an evolutionarily unstable strategy. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore a correlation between stress physiology and group size in a joint-nesting species."
https://openalex.org/W2601507643,"Background In order to meet the Sustainable Development Goal to decrease maternal mortality, increased access to obstetric interventions such as Caesarean sections (CS) is of critical importance. As a result of women’s limited access to routine and emergency obstetric services in Nigeria, the country is a major contributor to the global burden of maternal mortality. In this analysis, we aim to establish rates of CS and determine socioeconomic or medical risk factors associated with having a CS in Enugu, southeast Nigeria. Methods Data for this study originated from the Healthy Beginning Initiative study. Participant characteristics were obtained from 2300 women at baseline via a semi-structured questionnaire. Only women between the ages of 17–45 who had singleton deliveries were retained for this analysis. Post-delivery questionnaires were used to ascertain mode-of-delivery. Crude and adjusted logistic regressions with Caesarean as the main outcome are presented. Results In this sample, 7.22% women had a CS. Compared to women who lived in an urban setting, those who lived in a rural setting had a significant reduction in the odds of having a CS (aOR: 0.58; 0.38–0.89). Significantly higher odds of having a CS were seen among those with high peripheral malaria parasitemia compared to those with low parasitemia (aOR: 1.54; 1.04–2.28). Conclusion This study revealed that contrary to the increasing trend in use of CS in low-income countries, women in this region of Nigeria had limited access to this intervention. Increasing age and socioeconomic proxies for income and access to care (e.g., having a tertiary-level education, full-time employment, and urban residence) were shown to be key determinants of access to CS. Further research is needed to ascertain the obstetric conditions under which women in this region receive CS, and to further elucidate the role of socioeconomic factors in accessing CS."

This approach may lead to the chronic exposure of bees to this liposoluble chemical, which tends to accumulate in hives. We cloned a variant of the V. destructor voltage-dependent sodium (VdNaV1) channel and studied its biophysical characteristics and sensitivity to τ-fluvalinate using the Xenopus oocyte expression system and the 2-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. We compared the affinity of VdNaV1 for τ-fluvalinate with the honeybee voltage-dependent sodium ortholog.

https://openalex.org/W2963272591,"Standard evolutionary theories of aging and mortality, implicitly based on assumptions of spatial averaging, hold that natural selection cannot favor shorter lifespan without direct compensating benefit to individual reproductive success. However, a number of empirical observations appear as exceptions to or are difficult to reconcile with this view, suggesting explicit lifespan control or programmed death mechanisms inconsistent with the classic understanding. Moreover, evolutionary models that take into account the spatial distributions of populations have been shown to exhibit a variety of self-limiting behaviors, maintained through environmental feedback. Here we extend recent work on spatial modeling of lifespan evolution, showing that both theory and phenomenology are consistent with programmed death. Spatial models show that self-limited lifespan robustly results in long-term benefit to a lineage; longer-lived variants may have a reproductive advantage for many generations, but shorter lifespan ultimately confers long-term reproductive advantage through environmental feedback acting on much longer time scales. Numerous model variations produce the same qualitative result, demonstrating insensitivity to detailed assumptions; the key conditions under which self-limited lifespan is favored are spatial extent and locally exhaustible resources. Factors including lower resource availability, higher consumption, and lower dispersal range are associated with evolution of shorter lifespan. A variety of empirical observations can parsimoniously be explained in terms of long-term selective advantage for intrinsic mortality. Classically anomalous empirical data on natural lifespans and intrinsic mortality, including observations of longer lifespan associated with increased predation, and evidence of programmed death in both unicellular and multicellular organisms, are consistent with specific model predictions. The generic nature of the spatial model conditions under which intrinsic mortality is favored suggests a firm theoretical basis for the idea that evolution can quite generally select for shorter lifespan directly."
https://openalex.org/W2598182404,"Spatial closures are widely used in marine conservation and fisheries management and it is important to understand their contribution to achieving management objectives. Many previous evaluations of closed area effects have used before-after comparisons, which, without controlling for a full range of factors, cannot ascribe changes in fleet behaviour to area closures per se. In this study we used a counterfactual approach to disentangle the effect of two closed areas on fishing location from other competing effects on the behaviour of the Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery. Our results revealed an inconsistent effect of the one of the closed areas between years, after taking into account the influence of environmental conditions on fleet behaviour. This suggests that the policy of closing the area per se was not the main driver for the fleet allocating its effort elsewhere. We also showed a marked difference in effect between the two closed areas resulting from their different locations in the fishery area. These findings highlight the need to account for other key fleet behavioural drivers when predicting or evaluating the contribution of area closures to achieving conservation and fishery management objectives."
https://openalex.org/W2598980744,"Background Child gender preference is important in some cultures and has been found to modify risk for antenatal and postnatal depression. We investigated discrepancies in the child gender preference between participating women and other key family members and the extent to which these predicted perinatal depression. Methods In a large cohort study of perinatal depression in urban and rural Turkey, participants had been asked about child gender preferences: their own, and those of their husband, parents, and parents in-law. Of 730 participants recruited in their third trimester (94.6% participation), 578 (79.2%) were reassessed at a mean (SD) 4.1 (3.3) months after childbirth, and 488 (66.8%) were reassessed at 13.7 (2.9) months. Results No associations were found between any gender preference reported in the antenatal period and depression at any examination. On the other hand, we found associations of antenatal depression with differences in participant-reported gender preference and that reported for their mother-in-law (OR 1.81, 1.08–3.04). This non-agreement also predicted depression at the 4 month (OR 2.24, 1.24–4.03) and 14 month (OR 2.07, 1.05–4.04) post-natal examinations. These associations with postnatal depression persisted after adjustment for a range of covariates (ORs 3.19 (1.54–6.59) and 3.30 (1.49–7.33) respectively). Conclusions Reported disagreement in child gender preferences between a woman and her mother-in-law was a predictor of post-natal depression and may reflect wider family disharmony as an underlying factor."
https://openalex.org/W2602916344,"Melanin pigmentation patterns are ubiquitous in animals and function in crypsis, physical protection, thermoregulation and signalling. In vertebrates, pigmentation patterns formed over large body regions as well as within appendages (hair/feathers) may be due to the differential distribution of pigment producing cells (melanocytes) and/or regulation of the melanin synthesis pathway. We took advantage of the pigmentation patterns of Japanese quail embryos (pale ventrum and patterned feathers dorsally) to explore the role of genes and their transcripts in regulating the function of the melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) via 1. activation: pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), endoproteases prohormone convertase 1 (PC1) and 2 (PC2), and 2. inhibition-agouti signaling and agouti-related protein (ASIP and AGRP, respectively). Melanocytes are present in all feather follicles at both 8 and 12 days post-fertilisation (E8/E12), so differential deposition of melanocytes is not responsible for pigmentation patterns in embryonic quail. POMC transcripts expressed were a subset of those found in chicken and POMC expression within feather follicles was strong. PC1 was not expressed in feather follicles. PC2 was strongly expressed in all feather follicles at E12. ASIP transcript expression was variable and we report four novel ASIP transcripts. ASIP is strongly expressed in ventral feather follicles, but not dorsally. AGRP expression within feather follicles was weak. These results demonstrate that the pale-bellied quail phenotype probably involves inhibition of MC1R, as found previously. However, quail may require MC1R activation for eumelanogenesis in dorsal feathers which may have important implications for an understanding of colour pattern formation in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2598889228,"In this study, two kinds of cellulose derivatives (polyanionic cellulose (PAC) and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC)) were selected as stabilizers of Pd/Fe nanoparticles (NPs) to investigate their influences on the debromination performances of 2,2',4,4'-tretrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE47). Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images revealed that the cellulose-stabilized Pd/Fe NPs were smaller and more uniform than the bare-Pd/Fe NPs. X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results suggested that cellulose coatings found on Pd/Fe NPs surfaces featured some antioxidation abilities, which followed the order of HPMC < PAC. Sedimentation tests demonstrated that the stabilizing power of PAC for Pd/Fe NPs was higher than that of HPMC. Fourier transfer infrared spectrometer (FTIR) results indicated that PAC molecules were bound to the Pd/Fe NPs surfaces by polar covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds, while HPMC molecules interacted with the nanoparticles by hydrogen bonds. Batch debromination test for BDE47 demonstrated that the catalytic debromination rate with cellulose-stabilized Pd/Fe NPs was higher than that with bare-Pd/Fe NPs during reaction period of 15 min. Overall, this study indicated that both celluloses are beneficial to forming smaller, more regular, stable and antioxidative Pd/Fe NPs, leading to higher debromination reactivity for BDE47 compared with the bare-Pd/Fe NPs. Therefore Pd/Fe NPs can be utilized as a promising remediation technology for the contaminated groundwater and soils."
https://openalex.org/W2602235536,"Scleractinian coral are experiencing unprecedented rates of mortality due to increases in sea surface temperatures in response to global climate change. Some coral species however, survive high temperature events due to a reduced susceptibility to bleaching. We investigated the relationship between bleaching susceptibility and expression of five metabolically related genes of Symbiodinium spp. from the coral Porites astreoides originating from an inshore and offshore reef in the Florida Keys. The acclimatization potential of Symbiodinium spp. to changing temperature regimes was also measured via a two-year reciprocal transplant between the sites. Offshore coral fragments displayed significantly higher expression in Symbiodinium spp. genes PCNA, SCP2, G3PDH, PCP and psaE than their inshore counterparts (p<0.05), a pattern consistent with increased bleaching susceptibility in offshore corals. Additionally, gene expression patterns in Symbiodinium spp. from site of origin were conserved throughout the two-year reciprocal transplant, indicating acclimatization did not occur within this multi-season time frame. Further, laboratory experiments were used to investigate the influence of acute high temperature (32°C for eight hours) and disease (lipopolysaccharide of Serratia marcescens) on the five metabolically related symbiont genes from the same offshore and inshore P. astreoides fragments. Gene expression did not differ between reef fragments, or as a consequence of acute exposure to heat or heat and disease, contrasting to results found in the field. Gene expression reported here indicates functional variation in populations of Symbiodinium spp. associated with P. astreoides in the Florida Keys, and is likely a result of localized adaptation. However, gene expression patterns observed in the lab imply that functional variation in zooxanthellae observed under conditions of chronic moderate stress is lost under the acute extreme conditions studied here."
https://openalex.org/W2603285157,"Many natural proteins are, as a whole or in part, intrinsically disordered. Frequently, such intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) undergo a transition to a defined and often helical conformation upon binding to partner molecules. The intrinsic propensity of an IDR sequence to fold into a helical conformation already in the absence of a binding partner can have a decisive influence on the binding process and affinity. Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations we have investigated the tendency of regions of Axin-1, an intrinsically disordered scaffolding protein of the WNT signaling pathway, to form helices in segments interacting with binding partners. Secondary chemical shifts from NMR measurements show an increased helical population in these regions. Systematic application of MD advanced sampling approaches on peptide segments of Axin-1 reproduces the experimentally observed tendency and allows insights into the distribution of segment conformations and free energies of helix formation. The results, however, were found to dependent on the force field water model. Recent water models specifically designed for IDRs significantly reduce the predicted helical content and do not improve the agreement with experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2602260776,"It is well known that pure-tone audiometry does not sufficiently describe individual hearing loss (HL) and that additional measures beyond pure-tone sensitivity might improve the diagnostics of hearing deficits. Specifically, forward masking experiments to estimate basilar-membrane (BM) input-output (I/O) function have been proposed. However, such measures are very time consuming. The present study investigated possible modifications of the temporal masking curve (TMC) paradigm to improve time and measurement efficiency. In experiment 1, estimates of knee point (KP) and compression ratio (CR) of individual BM I/Os were derived without considering the corresponding individual “off-frequency” TMC. While accurate estimation of KPs was possible, it is difficult to ensure that the tested dynamic range is sufficient. Therefore, in experiment 2, a TMC-based paradigm, referred to as the “gap method”, was tested. In contrast to the standard TMC paradigm, the maker level was kept fixed and the “gap threshold” was obtained, such that the masker just masks a low-level (12 dB sensation level) signal. It is argued that this modification allows for better control of the tested stimulus level range, which appears to be the main drawback of the conventional TMC method. The results from the present study were consistent with the literature when estimating KP levels, but showed some limitations regarding the estimation of the CR values. Perspectives and limitations of both approaches are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2597783877,"KCNE3 (MiRP2) forms heteromeric voltage-gated K+ channels with the skeletal muscle-expressed KCNC4 (Kv3.4) α subunit. KCNE3 was the first reported skeletal muscle K+ channel disease gene, but the requirement for KCNE3 in skeletal muscle has been questioned. Here, we confirmed KCNE3 transcript and protein expression in mouse skeletal muscle using Kcne3-/- tissue as a negative control. Whole-transcript microarray analysis (770,317 probes, interrogating 28,853 transcripts) findings were consistent with Kcne3 deletion increasing gastrocnemius oxidative metabolic gene expression and the proportion of type IIa fast-twitch oxidative muscle fibers, which was verified using immunofluorescence. The down-regulated transcript set overlapped with muscle unloading gene expression profiles (≥1.5-fold change; P < 0.05). Gastrocnemius K+ channel α subunit remodeling arising from Kcne3 deletion was highly specific, involving just 3 of 69 α subunit genes probed: known KCNE3 partners KCNC4 and KCNH2 (mERG) were down-regulated, and KCNK4 (TRAAK) was up-regulated (P < 0.05). Functionally, Kcne3-/- mice exhibited abnormal hind-limb clasping upon tail suspension (63% of Kcne3-/- mice ≥10-mo-old vs. 0% age-matched Kcne3+/+ littermates). Whereas 5 of 5 Kcne3+/+ mice exhibited the typical biphasic decline in contractile force with repetitive stimuli of hind-limb muscle, both in vivo and in vitro, this was absent in 6 of 6 Kcne3-/- mice tested. Finally, myoblasts isolated from Kcne3-/- mice exhibit faster-inactivating and smaller sustained outward currents than those from Kcne3+/+ mice. Thus, Kcne3 deletion impairs skeletal muscle function in mice.-King, E. C., Patel, V., Anand, M., Zhao, X., Crump, S. M., Hu, Z., Weisleder, N., Abbott, G. W. Targeted deletion of Kcne3 impairs skeletal muscle function in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2601800073,"In recent years, dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have increased in parallel to sedentary behavior and diabetes across the world. To test any putative association between dietary PUFA and sedentary behavior or diabetes in females, we obtained country-specific, cross-sectional data on sedentary activity and diabetes prevalence from European Cardiovascular Statistics 2012. Age and gender-specific, nutritional data from each country were obtained from nutritional surveys as well. Socioeconomic (GDP), physical environment (urbanization index) and climatic confounders were accounted for each country. Upon analysis, we found a strong, positive association between sedentary lifestyle in 11-yr old girls (> = 2 hours of TV/ weekday) and dietary PUFA across 21 European countries. Further, a weak association of dietary PUFA and a strong relationship of per-capita GDP was established with elevated fasting blood glucose [(> = 7.0 mmol/L; or on medication] among 25+ year old adult females across 23 countries in Europe. In summary, we present novel ecological evidence that dietary PUFA is strongly associated with sedentary behavior among pre-teen girls and weakly associated with diabetes among adult women across Europe. In the latter group, per-capita GDP was a significant predictor for diabetes as well. Therefore, we recommend that prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) be implemented to evaluate if ubiquitous presence of dietary PUFA and low socioeconomic status are possible confounders when intervening to treat/prevent sedentary lifestyle or diabetes in female subjects in Western nations."
