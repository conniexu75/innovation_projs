Careful selection of MOF constituents can yield crystals of ultrahigh porosity and high thermal and chemical stability. These characteristics allow the interior of MOFs to be chemically altered for use in gas separation, gas storage, and catalysis, among other applications. The precision commonly exercised in their chemical modification and the ability to expand their metrics without changing the underlying topology have not been achieved with other solids. MOFs whose chemical composition and shape of building units can be multiply varied within a particular structure already exist and may lead to materials that offer a synergistic combination of properties."

Mani et al. (p. 976 ; see the Perspective by Vohs) gathered evidence from shoppers in a New Jersey mall and from farmers in Tamil Nadu, India. They found that considering a projected financial decision, such as how to pay for a car repair, affects people's performance on unrelated spatial and reasoning tasks. Lower-income individuals performed poorly if the repairs were expensive but did fine if the cost was low, whereas higher-income individuals performed well in both conditions, as if the projected financial burden imposed no cognitive pressure. Similarly, the sugarcane farmers from Tamil Nadu performed these tasks better after harvest than before."

This signal triggers an innate immune response, which involves the expression of type I interferons, and is critical for antiviral immunity and responses to DNA vaccines. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) was recently identified as a sensor of cytosolic DNA. Li et al. (p. 1390 , published online 29 August) now use knockout mice to provide genetic evidence that, in multiple cell types, cGAS is the primary DNA sensor required for the type I interferon response in vivo."

Vacancies in the surface region of the TiO 2 rutile phase can transfer a negative charge to adsorbed O 2 to create more reactive species. By contrast, in anatase—the phase associated with nanoscale TiO 2 particles—subsurface vacancies form. Setvin et al. (p. 988 ) used a scanning tunneling microscopy tip to pull these vacancies to the surface in a niobiumdoped anatase crystal and followed the transformation of adsorbed O 2 − into a peroxo species and a bridging O 2 dimer."

Shyer et al. (p. 212 , published online 29 August; see the Perspective by Simons ) show that in both the developing human and chick gut, the villi are formed in a step-wise progression, involving the sequential folding of the endoderm into longitudinal ridges, via a zigzag pattern, to finally form individual villi. These changes are established through the differentiation of the smooth muscle layers of the gut, restricting the expansion of the adjacent proliferating and growing endoderm and mesenchyme, generating compressive stresses that lead to the buckling and folding of the tissue."

However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, and by using multiple rodent models of depression, Li et al. (p. 1016 ) identified a signaling pathway and associated neuronal adaptations in which the enzyme βCaMKII was selectively up-regulated in the LHb. Manipulations that enhanced βCaMKII levels increased depression-related phenotypes, and RNA interference of CaMKIIb blunted depression. Enhanced βCaMKII levels in the habenula promoted excitatory synaptic transmission on these neurons and increased action potential firing mediated by an up-regulation of a specific subtype of glutamate receptors."

However, the molecular mechanisms of IFT are poorly understood. Here, we found that the two core IFT proteins IFT74 and IFT81 form a tubulin-binding module and mapped the interaction to a calponin homology domain of IFT81 and a highly basic domain in IFT74. Knockdown of IFT81 and rescue experiments with point mutants showed that tubulin binding by IFT81 was required for ciliogenesis in human cells."

Okada et al. (p. 1496 , published online 29 August) used scanning tunneling microscopy to map out the energies of the electronic levels of the TCI Pb 1- x Sn x Se as a function of the strength of an external magnetic field. The massless Dirac fermions coexisted with massive ones, presumably as a consequence of a distortion of the crystalline structure affecting only one of the two mirror symmetries."

The recovery of North American Whooping Cranes by release of captive-reared birds trained to migrate by following aircraft provided an opportunity for Mueller et al. (p. 999 ; see the cover) to analyze 8 years of data for individual birds. The presence of older birds within a group of migrating cranes significantly decreased the deviations the flock took from a straight line migration path. The lack of evidence for a genetic component indicates that social learning dominates any innate capacity in developing migratory behavior."

(p. 981 ; see the Perspective by Schnittman ) report x-ray data on the accretion flow around this supermassive black hole, revealing how it interacts with its surroundings. The data rule out the possibility that the quiescent (that is, flare-free) x-rays observed are produced by coronal emission from a population of stars at the center of the Galaxy and also rule out the possibility that there is a pure radiatively inefficient accretion flow with no outflows."

To achieve this, it is attached to a carrier lipid by the integral membrane protein MraY. MraY is targeted by natural antibacterials and is a promising antibiotic target. Chung et al. (p. 1012 ) report the crystal structure of MraY at 3.3 Å resolution. The structure, together with mutational mapping, outlines the location of the active site and provides interesting hints for how the enzyme binds the substrate and catalyzes attachment to the carrier lipid."
https://openalex.org/W2018348121,"Because tuberculosis is one of the most prevalent and serious infections, countermeasures against it are urgently required. We isolated the antitubercular agents caprazamycins from the culture of an actinomycete strain and created CPZEN-45 as the most promising derivative of the caprazamycins. Herein, we describe the mode of action of CPZEN-45 first against Bacillus subtilis. Unlike the caprazamycins, CPZEN-45 strongly inhibited incorporation of radiolabeled glycerol into growing cultures and showed antibacterial activity against caprazamycin-resistant strains, including a strain overexpressing translocase-I (MraY, involved in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan), the target of the caprazamycins. By contrast, CPZEN-45 was not effective against a strain overexpressing undecaprenyl-phosphate-GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase (TagO, involved in the biosynthesis of teichoic acid), and a mutation was found in the tagO gene of the spontaneous CPZEN-45-resistant strain. This suggested that the primary target of CPZEN-45 in B. subtilis is TagO, which is a different target from that of the parent caprazamycins. This suggestion was confirmed by evaluation of the activities of these enzymes. Finally, we showed that CPZEN-45 was effective against WecA (Rv1302, also called Rfe) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the ortholog of TagO and involved in the biosynthesis of the mycolylarabinogalactan of the cell wall of M. tuberculosis. The outlook for WecA as a promising target for the development of antituberculous drugs as a countermeasure of drug resistant tuberculosis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2047368505,"Complexity and Diversity Complex organisms must produce and maintain an extraordinary diversity of cell and tissue types with a limited number of genes and molecular pathways. Cells accomplish this by reusing the same signaling networks at different times, in different tissues, and for different purposes, yet how this context-specificity is achieved is poorly understood. Jukam et al. ( 1238016 , published online 29 August) show how a set of genes that function in cell and tissue growth can be used again in nondividing fly photoreceptor neurons to ensure that flies develop appropriate sensitivity to both blue and green light. The Hippo pathway undergoes a regulatory change—from negative to positive feedback—that requires a tissue-specific transcription factor network. This network uses evolutionarily conserved regulatory factors whose mutations in humans result in degenerative retinal diseases. The context-appropriate positive feedback in flies ensures an all-or-nothing fate decision necessary to establish a functional visual system."

Iron uptake by osteoclast precursors via the transferrin cycle increases mitochondrial biogenesis, reactive oxygen species production, and activation of cAMP response element-binding protein, a critical transcription factor downstream of receptor activator of NF-κB-ligand-induced calcium signaling. These changes are required for the differentiation of osteoclast precursors to mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating cellular iron metabolism in osteoclasts remain largely unknown. In this report, we provide evidence that Steap4, a member of the six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate (Steap) family proteins, is an endosomal ferrireductase with a critical role in cellular iron utilization in osteoclasts.

Significance: This work provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating cellular iron metabolism in osteoclast lineage cells. Osteoclasts are highly specialized, multinucleated cells capable of resorbing calcified cartilage and bone matrix during skeletal development, growth, and remodeling (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Osteoclast differentiation and activation.Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4895) Google Scholar, 2Teitelbaum S.L. Bone resorption by osteoclasts.Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar). Osteoclastic bone resorption is essential for bone and mineral homeostasis under physiological conditions. Exaggerated bone resorption, either because of increased osteoclast number or enhanced activity, leads to pathological bone loss and is the culprit of metabolic bone diseases such as postmenopausal osteoporosis, Paget disease of bone, rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal disease, and tumor bone metastasis (3Helfrich M.H. Osteoclast diseases.Microscopy Res. Tech. 2003; 61: 514-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts originate from mononuclear progenitors of the macrophage lineage that eventually fuse to form polykaryons in a multistep process that is controlled by two indispensible cytokines: the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) 3The abbreviations used are: M-CSFthe macrophage colony-stimulating factorRANKLreceptor activator of NF-κB ligandCREBcAMP response element-binding proteinROSreactive oxygen speciesTftransferrinTfR1transferrin receptor 1α-MEMα-minimal essential mediumBMMbone marrow macrophageTRAPtartrate-resistant acid phosphatasePG SKPhen Green SKpOCpreosteoclastOCmature osteoclast2,2′-DPD2,2′-dipyridyl. and the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) (4Suda T.

Rev. 1999; 20: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar). M-CSF stimulates the proliferation of macrophages and the survival of the mature osteoclast polykaryons by activating ERK and the PI3K/AKT pathways (5Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. αvβ3 and macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Partners in osteoclast biology.Immunol. Rev. 2005; 208: 88-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). RANKL, on the other hand, induces the expression of osteoclast-specific genes and promotes the survival of mature osteoclasts by activating NF-κB, MAPKs, and PI3K/AKT (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Osteoclast differentiation and activation.Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4895) Google Scholar). In addition, RANKL stimulates [Ca2+]i oscillation in osteoclast precursors, and [Ca2+]i, in turn, activates calcineurin and a calmodulin-dependent kinase-CREB pathway, resulting in the induction and activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 1 (NFATc1), the master transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis (6Sato K.

Activation of CREB during osteoclast differentiation induces the expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1β (PGC-1β). PGC-1β then acts to stimulate mitochondrion biogenesis and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which promote osteoclastogenesis by increasing the activity of CREB and PGC-1β in a positive feedback manner (8Ishii K.A.

Iron uptake through the transferrin/transferrin receptor (Tf/TfR1) pathway also augments osteoclastogenesis, and the effects of iron are mediated, at least in part, by ROS (8Ishii K.A. Fumoto T.

In the extracellular fluid, ferric iron (Fe3+) is mainly bound to Tf with high affinity. Most mammalian cells acquire iron through the Tf cycle, in which iron-loaded Tf binds to TfR on the cell surface, and the complex is then internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis (10Chen C. Paw B.H. Cellular and mitochondrial iron homeostasis in vertebrates.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 1459-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11Pantopoulos K. Porwal S.K. Tartakoff A. Devireddy L. Mechanisms of mammalian iron homeostasis.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 5705-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Fe3+ is released from Tf because of acidic pH in endosomes. The Tf-TfR1 complex returns to the plasma membrane and is ready for another round of iron uptake. Before Fe3+ can be transported across the endosomal membrane to the cytoplasm, it must be reduced to ferrous iron (Fe2+). The six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate (Steap) family of proteins has been recently identified as ferrireductases responsible for the reduction of Fe3+ in mammalian cells (12Knutson M.D. Steap proteins. Implications for iron and copper metabolism.Nutr. Rev. 2007; 65: 335-340PubMed Google Scholar). Three of the four Steap family members, Steap2, Steap3, and Steap4, are ferric and cupric reductases (13Ohgami R.S. Campagna D.R. McDonald A. Fleming M.D. The Steap proteins are metalloreductases.Blood. 2006; 108: 1388-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Notably, mutations in Steap3 in humans and mice lead to microcytic hypochromic anemia, which is caused by deficient iron uptake in erythroid cells (14Ohgami R.S. Campagna D.R. Greer E.L. Antiochos B.

Heretofore, it remains unknown whether Steap family proteins are expressed in osteoclasts and whether they play a role in iron uptake in this cell type. Mitochondria are the primary consumers of cellular iron for the synthesis of heme and iron-sulfur clusters. Iron is also an integral element in protein complexes along the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which generates adenosine triphosphate for cellular energy metabolism and produces ROS (20Richardson D.R.

At high concentrations, ROS damage DNA, lipids, and proteins and, thus, cause oxidative stress, one of the major factors implicated in aging and age-associated diseases such as atherosclerosis, arthritis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (21Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Oxidants, oxidative stress and the biology of ageing.Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7298) Google Scholar). On the other hand, at lower nontoxic levels, ROS serve as signaling modifiers in various receptor pathways (22Finkel T. Signal transduction by reactive oxygen species.J.

In the work reported here, we have elucidated that Steap4 is an important endosomal ferrireductase in osteoclast lineage cells, responsible for the conversion of ferric iron into ferrous iron for cellular usage. Knocking down Steap4 expression in macrophages inhibits osteoclast formation and decreases cellular ferrous iron concentration, which, in turn, reduces mitochondria ROS production and RANKL-induced CREB activation. Therefore, increased Steap4 expression, working in concert with the up-regulated Tf/TfR pathway identified previously, promotes cellular iron uptake and utilization to cope with the increased iron demand during osteoclast development and function.

Fresh media and CMG 14-12 supernatant were replaced every the other day. Osteoclasts were generated after 5 days of culture of BMMs with 1/100 volume of CMG 14-12 supernatant and 100 ng/ml of recombinant RANKL. BMMs were cultured in 6-well plates with M-CSF and/or RANKL for 5 days. Total RNA was purified using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. First-strand cDNAs were synthesized from 0.5–1 μg of total RNA using the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen) following the instructions of the manufacturer.

Samples were amplified using the StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Invitrogen) with an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The relative mRNA amounts were calculated by normalizing to the mitochondrial gene Mrps2 mRNA, which is steadily expressed in both BMMs and osteoclasts, using the ΔCt method (31Schmittgen T.D.

A firefly luciferase shRNA was used as a control (5′-GCTTACGCTGAGTACTTCGA-3′). 293-T cells were cotransfected with a LKO.1 gene transfer vector and virus packaging vectors ΔH8.2 and VSVG by TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus). Virus supernatants were collected after 48 h of transfection. BMMs were transduced with virus supernatant containing M-CSF and 20 μg/ml of protamine (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were then selected in α-10 medium containing M-CSF and 6 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 days. The HA-tagged, full-length murine Steap4 cDNA was amplified by PCR with Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) using pCMV-SPORT6-Steap4 (clone ID 3500056, Thermal Open Biosystems) as a template. The amplified cDNA was cloned into the pMX-IRES-BSR retrovirus vector. The sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. The recombinant retroviral vector was transfected into Plat E retroviral packing cells using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent. Virus supernatant was collected at 48 h after transfection. BMMs were transduced with virus for 24 h in α-10 medium containing M-CSF and 20 μg/ml of protamine. Cells were then selected in α-10 medium containing M-CSF and 1.5 μg/ml of blasticidin (Calbiochem) for 3 days. BMMs were cultured on a 48-well tissue culture plate in α-10 medium with M-CSF and RANKL for 4–5 days. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, and TRAP was stained with NaK tartrate and naphthol AS-BI phosphoric acid (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (32Jilka R.L. Hangoc G.

For the measurement of TRAP activity, BMMs were cultured on a 96-well tissue culture plate in α-10 medium M-CSF and RANKL for 3–4 days. After washing twice in PBS, the cells were fixed with ethanol and acetone (1:1) for 1 min. The cells were air-dried at room temperature. 80 μl of 20 mm phosphatase substrate and 80 mm tartaric acid in 0.09 m citrate buffer were added to each well. After the cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 0.1 N NaOH to each well. The optical density at 405 nm was measured using an iMark microplate reader (Bio-Rad) (33Kirstein B. Chambers T.J. Fuller K.

Cultured cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1 mm DTT and Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. 10–30 μg of total protein was subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred electrophoretically onto PVDF membrane by a semidry blotting system (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked in 5% fat-free milk/Tris-buffered saline for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After rinsing three times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was subjected to Western blot analysis with enhanced chemiluminescent detection reagents (Millipore). Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (34Zhao H. Laitala-Leinonen T. Parikka V. Väänänen H.K.

In brief, cells grown on glass coverslips on a 24-well plate were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, followed by permeabilization and blocking in PBS/0.2% BSA/0.1% saponin for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies in PBS/0.2% BSA/0.1% saponin for 2 h. Primary antibody labeling was visualized using fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) in PBS/0.2% BSA/0.1% saponin for 45 min. F-actin was stained with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Invitrogen). The nucleus was labeled with Hoechst 33258. Samples were mounted with 80% glycerol/PBS. Immunofluorescence-labeled cells were observed using a Carl Zeiss fluorescence microscope equipped with a charge-coupled device camera. BMMs were cultured with M-CSF and RANKL for 3 days. 10 μm of dichlorodihydrofluorescein was added to the culture medium and then incubated for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS. The released fluorescent 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin was measured by a microplate fluorescence reader Synergy 2 (BioTek Instruments) with excitation/emission wavelengths of 485/528 nm, respectively, and recorded by Gene 5 software (35Almeida M.

Mitochondrial ROS was stained with 5 μm MitoSOX Red for 10 min, followed by washing three times with Hanks' buffer. Fluorescence intensity was measured by a microplate fluorescence reader Synergy 2 with excitation/emission wavelengths of 510/580 nm, respectively. BMMs were cultured in α-10 medium with M-CSF and RANKL for 3 days. The cells were rinsed twice with prewarmed α-MEM. The cells were loaded with PG SK (20 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C in α-MEM. After rinsing with α-MEM, 10 mm of 2,2-dipyridyl (2,2′-DPD) was added. Cellular fluorescence was recorded by Gene 5 software at the indicated time points using a microplate fluorescence reader Synergy 2 with excitation/emission wavelengths of 485/528 nm, respectively (36Petrat F.

In search of molecules regulating osteoclast iron metabolism, we performed a real-time PCR experiment to examine the expression of Steap family members during osteoclast differentiation. As shown in Fig. 1, Steap1 and Steap2 mRNAs were undetectable in osteoclast lineage cells. Steap3, which is essential for iron metabolism in erythroid cells (14Ohgami R.S. Campagna D.R. Greer E.L. Antiochos B. McDonald A. Chen J. Sharp J.J. Fujiwara Y. Barker J.E. Fleming M.D. Identification of a ferrireductase required for efficient transferrin-dependent iron uptake in erythroid cells.Nat.

Although Steap4 mRNA was undetected in BMMs, its expression was up-regulated during osteoclast differentiation, reaching its highest level in mature cells. This result strongly suggests that Steap4 might be functionally important in osteoclast formation and/or function. To unravel the role of Steap4 in osteoclast biology, we proceeded to knock down its expression in osteoclast lineage cells by lentiviral transduction of shRNAs (Steap4-sh1 and Steap4-sh2), specifically targeting Steap4 mRNA in BMMs. A shRNA-targeting firefly luciferase (Luc-sh) was used as a negative control. Positively transduced BMMs were then cultured with M-CSF and RANKL, and the mRNA levels of Steap4 in BMMs, preosteoclasts (pOCs), and mature osteoclasts (OCs) were measured by real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 2A, Steap4 shRNAs potently inhibited Steap4 expression in pOCs and OCs without changing the expression levels of the other three Steap proteins (Fig. 2B). Decreased Steap4 expression resulted in markedly reduced osteoclast formation as compared with Luc-sh-transduced cells, as evidenced by the decrease of multinucleated cells staining positively"

https://openalex.org/W2065114693,"The C terminus of Hsp70 interacting protein (CHIP) E3 ligase functions as a key regulator of protein quality control by binding the C-terminal (M/I)EEVD peptide motif of Hsp/c70(90) with its N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain and facilitating polyubiquitination of misfolded client proteins via its C-terminal catalytic U-box. Using CFTR as a model client, we recently showed that the duration of the Hsc70-client binding cycle is a primary determinant of stability. However, molecular features that control CHIP recruitment to Hsp/c70, and hence the fate of the Hsp/c70 client, remain unknown. To understand how CHIP recognizes Hsp/c70, we utilized a dominant negative mutant in which loss of a conserved proline in the U-box domain (P269A) eliminates E3 ligase activity. In a cell-free reconstituted ER-associated degradation system, P269A CHIP inhibited Hsc70-dependent CFTR ubiquitination and degradation in a dose-dependent manner. Optimal inhibition required both the TPR and the U-box, indicating cooperativity between the two domains. Neither the wild type nor the P269A mutant changed the extent of Hsc70 association with CFTR nor the dissociation rate of the Hsc70-CFTR complex. However, the U-box mutation stimulated CHIP binding to Hsc70 while promoting CHIP oligomerization. CHIP binding to Hsc70 binding was also stimulated by the presence of an Hsc70 client with a preference for the ADP-bound state. Thus, the Hsp/c70 (M/I)EEVD motif is not a simple anchor for the TPR domain. Rather CHIP recruitment involves reciprocal allosteric interactions between its TPR and U-box domains and the substrate-binding and C-terminal domains of Hsp/c70."
https://openalex.org/W2081797711,"Adherens junction (AJ) is a specialized cell-cell junction structure that plays a role in mechanically connecting adjacent cells to resist strong contractile forces and to maintain tissue structure, particularly in the epithelium. AJ is mainly comprised of cell adhesion molecules cadherin and nectin and their associating cytoplasmic proteins including β-catenin, α-catenin, p120(ctn), and afadin. Our series of studies have revealed that nectin first forms cell-cell adhesion and then recruits cadherin to form AJ. The recruitment of cadherin by nectin is mediated by the binding of α-catenin and p120(ctn) to afadin. Recent studies showed that PLEKHA7 binds to p120(ctn), which is associated with E-cadherin, and maintains the integrity of AJ in epithelial cells. In this study, we showed that PLEKHA7 bound to afadin in addition to p120(ctn) and was recruited to the nectin-3α-based cell-cell adhesion site in a manner dependent on afadin, but not on p120(ctn). The binding of PLEKHA7 to afadin was required for the proper formation of AJ, but not for the formation of tight junction, in EpH4 mouse mammary gland epithelial cells. These results indicate that PLEKHA7 plays a cooperative role with nectin and afadin in the proper formation of AJ in epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2117746386,"Molecular motors of the myosin superfamily share a generic motor domain region. They commonly bind actin in an ATP-sensitive manner, exhibit actin-activated ATPase activity, and generate force and movement in this interaction. Class-18 myosins form heavy chain dimers and contain protein interaction domains located at their unique N-terminal extension. Here, we characterized human myosin-18A molecular function in the interaction with nucleotides, F-actin, and its putative binding partner, the Golgi-associated phosphoprotein GOLPH3. We show that myosin-18A comprises two actin binding sites. One is located in the KE-rich region at the start of the N-terminal extension and appears to mediate ATP-independent binding to F-actin. The second actin-binding site resides in the generic motor domain and is regulated by nucleotide binding in the absence of intrinsic ATP hydrolysis competence. This core motor domain displays its highest actin affinity in the ADP state. Electron micrographs of myosin-18A motor domain-decorated F-actin filaments show a periodic binding pattern independent of the nucleotide state. We show that the PDZ module mediates direct binding of myosin-18A to GOLPH3, and this interaction in turn modulates the actin binding properties of the N-terminal extension. Thus, myosin-18A can act as an actin cross-linker with multiple regulatory modulators that targets interacting proteins or complexes to the actin-based cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2051532990,"Precise cell division is essential for multicellular development, and defects in this process have been linked to cancer. Septins are a family of proteins that are required for mammalian cell division, but their function and mode of regulation during this process are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) phosphorylates septin 9 (SEPT9) upon mitotic entry, and this phosphorylation controls association with the proline isomerase, Pin1. Both SEPT9 and Pin1 are critical for mediating the final separation of daughter cells. Expression of mutant SEPT9 that is defective in Pin1 binding was unable to rescue cytokinesis defects caused by SEPT9 depletion but rather induced dominant-negative defects in cytokinesis. However, unlike SEPT9 depletion, Pin1 was not required for the accumulation of the exocyst complex at the midbody. These results suggest that SEPT9 plays multiple roles in abscission, one of which is regulated by the action of Cdk1 and Pin1."
https://openalex.org/W1981566506,"Impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion caused by the lipotoxicity of palmitate was found in β-cells. Recent studies have indicated that defects in autophagy contribute to pathogenesis in type 2 diabetes. Here, we report that autophagy-related 7 (Atg7) induced excessive autophagic activation in INS-1(823/13) cells exposed to saturated fatty acids. Atg7-induced cathepsin B (CTSB) overexpression resulted in an unexpected significant increase in proinflammatory chemokine and cytokine production levels of IL-1β, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. Inhibition of receptor-interacting protein did not affect the inflammatory response, ruling out involvement of necrosis. CTSB siRNA suppressed the inflammatory response but did not affect apoptosis significantly, suggesting that CTSB was a molecular linker between autophagy and the proinflammatory response. Blocking caspase-3 suppressed apoptosis but did not affect the inflammatory response, suggesting that CTSB induced inflammatory effects independently of apoptosis. Silencing of Nod-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) completely abolished both IL-1β secretion and the down-regulation effects of Atg7-induced CTSB overexpression on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion impairment, thus identifying the NLRP3 inflammasome as an autophagy-responsive element in the pancreatic INS-1(823/13) cell line. Combined together, our results indicate that CTSB contributed to the Atg7-induced NLRP3-dependent proinflammatory response, resulting in aggravation of lipotoxicity, independently of apoptosis in the pancreatic INS-1(823/13) cell line."
https://openalex.org/W2042003411,"The majority of prostate cancer-related deaths are associated with advanced and metastatic malignancies. Although anoikis resistance has been recognized as one of the hallmarks of metastatic prostate malignancies, the molecular events that cause anoikis resistance are poorly understood. In this study, we found that the detachment of PC-3 prostate cancer cells caused a time-dependent increase in the expression level of the leukotriene B4 receptor-2 (BLT2) and that BLT2 played a critical role in establishing anoikis resistance in these cells. Blocking BLT2 with the pharmacological inhibitor LY255283 or with RNAi knockdown clearly abolished anoikis resistance and resulted in severe apoptotic death. Additionally, we demonstrated that the activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX) and subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were downstream of BLT2 signaling and led to the activation of NF-κB, thus establishing anoikis resistance during cell detachment. Furthermore, we observed that the ectopic expression of BLT2 in normal prostate PWR-1E cells rendered the cells resistant to anoikis and apparently diminished apoptotic cell death following detachment. Taken together, our results suggest that BLT2-NOX-ROS-NF-κB cascade induction during detachment confers a novel mechanism of anoikis resistance in prostate cancer cells and potentially contributes to prostate cancer progression.Background: Despite the critical role of anoikis resistance in prostate cancer progression, the molecular mechanism causing anoikis resistance remains unclear.Results: BLT2 protects prostate cancer cells against anoikis via a NOX-ROS-NF-κB-linked pathway.Conclusion: Activation of the BLT2-linked pathway following cell detachment confers anoikis resistance.Significance: Our findings suggest BLT2 as a key regulator of anoikis resistance in prostate cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2003573330,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) selectively induces apoptosis and kills cancer cells but not normal cells. However, TRAIL resistance due to low level of TRAIL receptor expression is widely found in cancer cells and hampers its development for cancer treatment. Thus, the agents that can sensitize the tumor cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis are urgently needed. We investigated whether tanshinones, the major bioactive compounds of Salvia miltiorrhiza (danshen), can up-regulate TRAIL receptor expression. Among the major tanshinones being tested, cryptotanshinone (CT) showed the best ability to induce TRAIL receptor 2 (DR5) expression. We further showed that CT was capable of promoting TRAIL-induced cell death and apoptosis in A375 melanoma cells. CT-induced DR5 induction was not cell type-specific, as DR5 induction was observed in other cancer cell types. DR5 knockdown abolished the enhancing effect of CT on TRAIL responses. Mechanistically, induction of the DR5 by CT was found to be p53-independent but dependent on the induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP). Knockdown of CHOP abolished CT-induced DR5 expression and the associated potentiation of TRAIL-mediated cell death. In addition, CT-induced ROS production preceded up-regulation of CHOP and DR5 and consequent sensitization of cells to TRAIL. Interestingly, CT also converted TRAIL-resistant lung A549 cancer cells into TRAIL-sensitive cells. Taken together, our results indicate that CT can potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis through up-regulation of DR5."
https://openalex.org/W2037972557,"The human sulfatase family has 17 members, 13 of which have been characterized biochemically. These enzymes specifically hydrolyze sulfate esters in glycosaminoglycans, sulfolipids, or steroid sulfates, thereby playing key roles in cellular degradation, cell signaling, and hormone regulation. The loss of sulfatase activity has been linked to severe pathophysiological conditions such as lysosomal storage disorders, developmental abnormalities, or cancer. A novel member of this family, arylsulfatase K (ARSK), was identified bioinformatically through its conserved sulfatase signature sequence directing posttranslational generation of the catalytic formylglycine residue in sulfatases. However, overall sequence identity of ARSK with other human sulfatases is low (18-22%). Here we demonstrate that ARSK indeed shows desulfation activity toward arylsulfate pseudosubstrates. When expressed in human cells, ARSK was detected as a 68-kDa glycoprotein carrying at least four N-glycans of both the complex and high-mannose type. Purified ARSK turned over p-nitrocatechol and p-nitrophenyl sulfate. This activity was dependent on cysteine 80, which was verified to undergo conversion to formylglycine. Kinetic parameters were similar to those of several lysosomal sulfatases involved in degradation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans. An acidic pH optimum (~4.6) and colocalization with LAMP1 verified lysosomal functioning of ARSK. Further, it carries mannose 6-phosphate, indicating lysosomal sorting via mannose 6-phosphate receptors. ARSK mRNA expression was found in all tissues tested, suggesting a ubiquitous physiological substrate and a so far non-classified lysosomal storage disorder in the case of ARSK deficiency, as shown before for all other lysosomal sulfatases."
https://openalex.org/W1996539011,"Molecularly engineered antibodies with fit-for-purpose properties will differentiate next generation antibody therapeutics from traditional IgG1 scaffolds. One requirement for engineering the most appropriate properties for a particular therapeutic area is an understanding of the intricacies of the target microenvironment in which the antibody is expected to function. Our group and others have demonstrated that proteases secreted by invasive tumors and pathological microorganisms are capable of cleaving human IgG1, the most commonly adopted isotype among monoclonal antibody therapeutics. Specific cleavage in the lower hinge of IgG1 results in a loss of Fc-mediated cell-killing functions without a concomitant loss of antigen binding capability or circulating antibody half-life. Proteolytic cleavage in the hinge region by tumor-associated or microbial proteases is postulated as a means of evading host immune responses, and antibodies engineered with potent cell-killing functions that are also resistant to hinge proteolysis are of interest. Mutation of the lower hinge region of an IgG1 resulted in protease resistance but also resulted in a profound loss of Fc-mediated cell-killing functions. In the present study, we demonstrate that specific mutations of the CH2 domain in conjunction with lower hinge mutations can restore and sometimes enhance cell-killing functions while still retaining protease resistance. By identifying mutations that can restore either complement- or Fcγ receptor-mediated functions on a protease-resistant scaffold, we were able to generate a novel protease-resistant platform with selective cell-killing functionality."

Significance: The ectopic precipitation of carbonate apatite deposits in body fluids and tissues may be initiated in part by MVs. Recent studies indicate that various NPs 3The abbreviations used are: NPnanoparticleALPalkaline phosphataseapoA-Iapolipoprotein AICPPcalciprotein particleDiR1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodideEDXenergy-dispersive x-rayHAPhydroxyapatiteHShuman serumMVmembrane vesicleNBnanobacteriaPSphosphatidylserineTEMtransmission electron microscopyVSMCvascular smooth muscle cell. present in the environment constantly interact with the human body and may be associated with disease conditions. For instance, the inhalation of asbestos nanofibers derived from fireproof materials is associated with the development of lung cancer and fibrotic lung damage known as asbestosis (1Donaldson K.

Similarly, titanium dioxide NPs, which are widely used as whitening agents in commercial products, induce acute toxicity to various organs in laboratory animals (2Chen J. Dong X. Zhao J. Tang G. In vivo acute toxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles to mice after intraperitioneal injection.J. Appl. Toxicol. 2009; 29: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Given that NPs show unexpected size-dependent properties and increased access to various body compartments, the potential toxicity of such nanomaterials represents an important safety concern and is now a major research focus in the fields of nanomedicine and nanotoxicology (3Kim B.Y.

Although the hypothesis that NB represent living microorganisms has been discarded, several studies have indicated that mineral NPs similar to NB do form in the growing bones and teeth of vertebrates (23Höhling H.J.

As such, these mineral NPs may represent calcification precursors found in both physiological and pathological mineralization processes. Human body fluids have been shown to contain membrane vesicles (MVs) in the form of small lipid-bound vesicles released from various cells (31Hugel B. Martínez M.C. Kunzelmann C. Freyssinet J.M. Membrane microparticles. Two sides of the coin.Physiology. 2005; 20: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). These vesicles have been broadly categorized as exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies (32György B. Szabó T.G. Pásztói M. Pál Z. Misják P. Aradi B. László V. Pállinger E. Pap E. Kittel A.

Exosomes represent 30–100-nm vesicles released from cellular endosomes and are thought to be involved in cell-to-cell signaling (32György B. Szabó T.G. Pásztói M. Pál Z. Misják P. Aradi B. László V.

Immunol. 2009; 9: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). Microvesicles are a more heterogeneous group of 100–1,000 nm vesicles released from the plasma membrane of various cells; they have been implicated in intercellular communication, homeostasis, and cellular waste disposal (32György B. Szabó T.G. Pásztói M. Pál Z. Misják P. Aradi B. László V. Pállinger E. Pap E. Kittel A. Nagy G. Falus A. Buzás E.I. Membrane vesicles, current state-of-the-art.

Res. 2010; 125: S49-S51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Apoptotic bodies represent particles ranging from 50 nm to 5 μm, which are released by apoptotic cells and removed through phagocytosis by macrophages (32György B. Szabó T.G. Pásztói M. Pál Z. Misják P. Aradi B. László V. Pállinger E. Pap E. Kittel A. Nagy G. Falus A. Buzás E.I. Membrane vesicles, current state-of-the-art. Emerging role of extracellular vesicles.Cell. Mol.

Immunol. 2009; 9: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). Given that the level of MVs is elevated in the body fluids of humans afflicted with various ailments, some authors have proposed that these vesicles may play a role in disease conditions that include arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, and chronic kidney disease (31Hugel B. Martínez M.C. Kunzelmann C. Freyssinet J.M. Membrane microparticles. Two sides of the coin.Physiology. 2005; 20: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 36Anderson H.C. Mulhall D.

Circulating microparticles in renal diseases.Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2008; 23: 2129-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it remains unclear whether MVs represent a consequence of the disease process or whether they play an active role in pathogenesis. Matrix vesicles represent a different type of extracellular vesicles implicated in physiological and pathological calcification processes in vertebrates (38Anderson H.C. Garimella R. Tague S.E. The role of matrix vesicles in growth plate development and biomineralization.Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 822-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 39Golub E.E.

Biomineralization and matrix vesicles in biology and pathology.Semin. Immunopathol. 2011; 33: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Matrix vesicles are 20–200-nm vesicles released from mineralizing cells, such as osteoblasts and odontoblasts, which induce mineralization in bones and teeth, respectively. During ectopic vascular calcification, these vesicles are also released by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which develop into osteoblast-like cells and induce calcium phosphate precipitation when exposed to excess phosphate, inflammation, or hyperlipidemia (38Anderson H.C. Garimella R. Tague S.E. The role of matrix vesicles in growth plate development and biomineralization.Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 822-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 39Golub E.E.

Biomineralization and matrix vesicles in biology and pathology.Semin. Immunopathol. 2011; 33: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Matrix vesicles are thought to induce mineralization by concentrating calcium and phosphate ions in various ways, including via specific ion transporters; in addition, these vesicles contain enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which degrades calcification inhibitors (e.g. pyrophosphate) and releases phosphate from various organic molecules. Although MVs similar to matrix vesicles and apoptotic bodies have been repeatedly described in calcified tissues (30Schlieper G. Aretz A. Verberckmoes S.C. Krüger T. Behets G.J. Ghadimi R. Weirich T.E. Rohrmann D. Langer S. Tordoir J.H. Amann K. Westenfeld R. Brandenburg V.M. D'Haese P.C. Mayer J. Ketteler M. McKee M.D. Floege J.

Metab. 2002; 20: 249-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the possibility that such vesicles may induce the formation of mineralo-organic NPs in body fluids has not been investigated. Phosphatidylserine (PS), a phospholipid usually confined to the inner lipid layer of the cell membrane (42Leventis P.A. Grinstein S. The distribution and function of phosphatidylserine in cellular membranes.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2010; 39: 407-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), has been found on the surface of various populations of MVs (32György B. Szabó T.G. Pásztói M. Pál Z. Misják P. Aradi B. László V. Pállinger E. Pap E. Kittel A. Nagy G. Falus A. Buzás E.I. Membrane vesicles, current state-of-the-art. Emerging role of extracellular vesicles.Cell. Mol.

Immunopathol. 2011; 33: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). When present on platelet-derived microvesicles, PS induces blood coagulation, a phenomenon associated with an increased risk of thrombosis (42Leventis P.A. Grinstein S. The distribution and function of phosphatidylserine in cellular membranes.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2010; 39: 407-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 43Nomura S. Ozaki Y. Ikeda Y. Function and role of microparticles in various clinical settings.Thromb. Res. 2008; 123: 8-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). On the surface of apoptotic bodies, PS is thought to represent a signal that induces phagocytosis and clearance of the vesicles by macrophages (42Leventis P.A. Grinstein S. The distribution and function of phosphatidylserine in cellular membranes.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2010; 39: 407-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Notably, PS possesses calcium-binding properties and may provide a nucleating site for calcium phosphate formation on both matrix vesicles (38Anderson H.C. Garimella R. Tague S.E. The role of matrix vesicles in growth plate development and biomineralization.Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 822-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 39Golub E.E.

Biomineralization and matrix vesicles in biology and pathology.Semin. Immunopathol. 2011; 33: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and apoptotic bodies (44Proudfoot D. Skepper J.N.

Res. 2000; 87: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Whether PS found on the surface of MVs may induce the mineralization of MVs in body fluids remains to be examined. Several studies have been conducted to identify the factors that induce formation of the so-called NB and mineralo-organic NPs. Cisar et al. (18Cisar J.O. Xu D.Q. Thompson J. Swaim W. Hu L. Kopecko D.J. An alternative interpretation of nanobacteria-induced biomineralization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 11511-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) observed that the cell membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol produces mineral NPs similar to NB after inoculation in DMEM and incubation in cell culture conditions. Raoult et al. (22Raoult D. Drancourt M. Azza S. Nappez C. Guieu R. Rolain J.M. Fourquet P. Campagna B. La Scola B. Mege J.L. Mansuelle P. Lechevalier E. Berland Y. Gorvel J.P. Renesto P. Nanobacteria are mineralo fetuin complexes.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) speculated that fetuin-A, a systemic calcification inhibitor (45Schinke T. Amendt C.

Nanobacteria are mineralo fetuin complexes.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), may initially inhibit NB formation but eventually act as a nucleator of NB formation following a conformational change similar to prion conversion. Our own experiments have shown that serum proteins like albumin and fetuin-A fail to induce NB formation under the conditions tested, although these proteins may form seeds for the formation of mineralo-organic NPs once the concentrations of calcium and phosphate ions exceed saturation (11Wu C.Y. Martel J. Young D. Young J.D. Fetuin-A/albumin-mineral complexes resembling serum calcium granules and putative nanobacteria. Demonstration of a dual inhibition-seeding concept.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e8058Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results suggest that other molecules or structures, possibly in the form of lipid membranes, may represent factors that induce the formation of mineralo-organic NPs similar to the so-called NB in body fluids. In the present study, we examined the possibility that mineral NP formation may be induced by MVs present in body fluids. We isolated a population of MVs from human serum (HS) and FBS and characterized the morphological and biochemical composition of these particles. Our results show that the isolated serum MVs induce the formation of mineralo-organic NPs when inoculated and incubated in cell culture medium, suggesting that MVs may serve as a nucleating agent of mineral NPs in culture and as a factor that induces ectopic calcification in human body fluids. Blood was collected from healthy human volunteers using a conventional venipuncture method. Written informed consents were obtained from the volunteers, and the use of human samples was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (Linkou, Taiwan). Whole blood was collected into Vacutainer tubes without anticoagulant (BD Biosciences). After centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 15 min at room temperature, the supernatant corresponding to HS was collected and stored at −20 °C. HS and commercial FBS (Biological Industries) were filtered through 0.2-μm pore membranes prior to use. MVs were isolated as before (47Caby M.P. Lankar D. Vincendeau-Scherrer C. Raposo G. Bonnerot C.

Detection and isolation of cell-derived microparticles are compromised by protein complexes resulting from shared biophysical parameters.Blood. 2011; 117: e39-e48Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, 10 ml of HS and FBS was centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to spin down and remove large cell debris. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant obtained this way was centrifuged for 60 min at 15,000 × g (SW27 rotor, Beckman Instruments). Material present in the supernatant was pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C (SW41 rotor, Beckman Instruments). The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and is referred in the present study as “membrane vesicles” (MVs). In some experiments, sodium azide was added at 0.02% to prevent microbial contamination. One ml of resuspended MVs was transferred to disposable plastic cuvettes (Kartell) and mixed by gentle inversion prior to reading using a Delsa Nano Submicron Particle Analyzer (Beckman Coulter). Measurements were performed at room temperature at an incident angle of 165°. Although the relative particle unit used in the y axis of Fig. 1, A and B, represents arbitrary values, this unit correlates in a linear manner with the observed particle amount under the conditions used. Aliquots of MVs resuspended in HEPES buffer were deposited on glass slides and observed without fixation or staining with a BX-51 optical microscope (Olympus) equipped with a ×100 oil immersion objective with iris (UPlanFLN, Olympus) and a dark field condenser (Cerbe Distribution).

https://openalex.org/W2014126009,"The heme molecule is the prosthetic group of many hemeproteins involved in essential physiological processes, such as electron transfer, transport of gases, signal transduction, and gene expression modulation. However, heme is a pro-oxidant molecule capable of propagating reactions leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species. The blood-feeding insect Rhodnius prolixus releases enormous amounts of heme during host blood digestion in the midgut lumen when it is exposed to a physiological oxidative challenge. Additionally, this organism produces a hemolymphatic heme-binding protein (RHBP) that transports heme to pericardial cells for detoxification and to growing oocytes for yolk granules and as a source of heme for embryo development. Here, we show that silencing of RHBP expression in female fat bodies reduced total RHBP circulating in the hemolymph, promoting oxidative damage to hemolymphatic proteins. Moreover, RHBP knockdown did not cause reduction in oviposition but led to the production of heme-depleted eggs (white eggs). A lack of RHBP did not alter oocyte fecundation. However, produced white eggs were nonviable. Embryo development cellularization and vitellin yolk protein degradation, processes that normally occur in early stages of embryogenesis, were compromised in white eggs. Total cytochrome c content, cytochrome c oxidase activity, citrate synthase activity, and oxygen consumption, parameters that indicate mitochondrial function, were significantly reduced in white eggs compared with normal dark red eggs. Our results showed that reduction of heme transport from females to growing oocytes by RHBP leads to embryonic mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired embryogenesis.Background: Rhodnius prolixus presents a heme-binding protein (RHBP) in eggs and hemolymph.Results: Eggs lacking RHBP failed to develop embryos and showed defective mitochondria.Conclusion: Maternally provided heme transported by RHBP supports mitochondrial function and early steps of embryogenesis.Significance: Recycling of intercellular transported heme is not restricted to heme auxotroph organisms and may be widespread in metazoans. The heme molecule is the prosthetic group of many hemeproteins involved in essential physiological processes, such as electron transfer, transport of gases, signal transduction, and gene expression modulation. However, heme is a pro-oxidant molecule capable of propagating reactions leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species. The blood-feeding insect Rhodnius prolixus releases enormous amounts of heme during host blood digestion in the midgut lumen when it is exposed to a physiological oxidative challenge. Additionally, this organism produces a hemolymphatic heme-binding protein (RHBP) that transports heme to pericardial cells for detoxification and to growing oocytes for yolk granules and as a source of heme for embryo development. Here, we show that silencing of RHBP expression in female fat bodies reduced total RHBP circulating in the hemolymph, promoting oxidative damage to hemolymphatic proteins. Moreover, RHBP knockdown did not cause reduction in oviposition but led to the production of heme-depleted eggs (white eggs). A lack of RHBP did not alter oocyte fecundation.

To determine potential functional promiscuity of similar DNA binding domains, we replaced the MLL CXXC domain in the context of the leukemogenic MLL-AF9 fusion with CXXC domains from DNMT1, CGBP (CFP1), and MBD1, or with a methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) from MBD1. MLL(DNMT1 CXXC)-AF9 shows robust in vitro colony forming activity and in vivo leukemogenesis, similar to MLL-AF9. However, colony forming ability and leukemogenicity are abrogated in MLL-AF9 containing either the CGBP or MBD1 CXXC domains or the MBD1 MBD domain. Direct comparison of in vitro DNA binding affinity of the isolated CXXC or MBD domains demonstrated that MLL, DNMT1, and CGBP CXXC domains could each bind to unmethylated DNA but with differing affinity. In contrast, the isolated MBD1 CXXC and MBD1 MBD domains were unable to bind to the same DNA. However, all substituted domains still allowed targeting of the MLL fusions to the functionally important Hoxa9 locus in primary bone marrow progenitor cells. In addition to DNA binding activity, it was critical that specific CpG residues in the Hoxa9 locus were protected from methylation for leukemia development. This ultimately prevented histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) of the locus and enabled Hoxa9 expression.

https://openalex.org/W2055745077,"Here, we investigated whether the cell surface glycoprotein CD47 was required for normal formation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts and to maintain normal bone formation activity in vitro and in vivo. In parathyroid hormone or 1α,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 (D3)-stimulated bone marrow cultures (BMC) from CD47(-/-) mice, we found a strongly reduced formation of multinuclear tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)(+) osteoclasts, associated with reduced expression of osteoclastogenic genes (nfatc1, Oscar, Trap/Acp, ctr, catK, and dc-stamp). The production of M-CSF and RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κβ ligand) was reduced in CD47(-/-) BMC, as compared with CD47(+/+) BMC. The stromal cell phenotype in CD47(-/-) BMC involved a blunted expression of the osteoblast-associated genes osterix, Alp/Akp1, and α-1-collagen, and reduced mineral deposition, as compared with that in CD47(+/+) BMC. CD47 is a ligand for SIRPα (signal regulatory protein α), which showed strongly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation in CD47(-/-) bone marrow stromal cells. In addition, stromal cells lacking the signaling SIRPα cytoplasmic domain also had a defect in osteogenic differentiation, and both CD47(-/-) and non-signaling SIRPα mutant stromal cells showed a markedly reduced ability to support osteoclastogenesis in wild-type bone marrow macrophages, demonstrating that CD47-induced SIRPα signaling is critical for stromal cell support of osteoclast formation. In vivo, femoral bones of 18- or 28-week-old CD47(-/-) mice showed significantly reduced osteoclast and osteoblast numbers and exhibited an osteopenic bone phenotype. In conclusion, lack of CD47 strongly impairs SIRPα-dependent osteoblast differentiation, deteriorate bone formation, and cause reduced formation of osteoclasts."

Mice with a deletion in the gene for PML (KO mice) exhibit altered gene expression in liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle, an accelerated rate of fatty acid metabolism, abnormal glucose metabolism, constitutive AMP-activating kinase (AMPK) activation, and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Last, an increased rate of energy expenditure protects PML KO mice from the effects of obesity induced by a Western diet.

https://openalex.org/W2128744588,"The nucleus/cytoplasm (N/C) ratio controls S phase dynamics in many biological systems, most notably the abrupt remodeling of the cell cycle that occurs at the midblastula transition in early Xenopus laevis embryos. After an initial series of rapid cleavage cycles consisting only of S and M phases, a critical N/C ratio is reached, which causes a sharp increase in the length of S phase as the cell cycle is reconfigured to resemble somatic cell cycles. How the N/C ratio determines the length of S phase has been a longstanding problem in developmental biology. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we show that DNA replication at high N/C ratio is restricted by one or more limiting substances. We report here that the protein phosphatase PP2A, in conjunction with its B55α regulatory subunit, becomes limiting for replication origin firing at high N/C ratio, and this in turn leads to reduced origin activation and an increase in the time required to complete S phase. Increasing the levels of PP2A catalytic subunit or B55α experimentally restores rapid DNA synthesis at high N/C ratio. Inversely, reduction of PP2A or B55α levels sharply extends S phase even in low N/C extracts. These results identify PP2A-B55α as a link between DNA replication and N/C ratio in egg extracts and suggest a mechanism that may influence the onset of the midblastula transition in vivo."

Amyloidoses are disorders marked by the deposition of fibrous protein aggregates (amyloids) within an organism (1Eisenberg D. Jucker M.

In mammals, these disorders include widespread sporadic or familial neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. Infectious amyloids, termed “prions,” cause transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and “mad cow” disease in cattle (for review, see Refs. 1Eisenberg D.

Not all amyloidoses are pathological, however. For example, amyloid of Pmel17 protein, formed in the mammalian melanocyte, is biologically beneficial (5Fowler D.M. Koulov A.V. Alory-Jost C. Marks M.S. Balch W.E. Kelly J.W. Functional amyloid formation within mammalian tissue.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e6Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). In yeast and fungi, there is an ever growing list of prions that control specific phenotypic traits; some of these prions may also have pathological effects (6Liebman S.W. Chernoff Y.O.

Amyloids are also formed spontaneously in the preparations of protein- or peptide-based drugs upon storage that decreases drug efficiency and may increase immunogenicity (10Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Protein misfolding, functional amyloid, and human disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar). The basic scheme of amyloid formation appears to be the same for all amyloidogenic proteins, mammalian or fungal. The process typically originates with a change in the secondary structure of the protein, resulting in an increased proportion of β-sheets (11Shorter J. Lindquist S. Prions as adaptive conduits of memory and inheritance.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). For many, maybe most (12Dobson C.M. Protein-misfolding diseases: Getting out of shape.Nature. 2002; 418: 729-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) proteins, such a conversion can occur in vitro under extreme solution conditions (high temperature and low pH), as in the cases of lysozyme, transthyretin, and insulin (13Chiti F.

Prion proteins, however, spontaneously misfold under physiological conditions. Regardless of how the conformers were induced, the β-sheet-rich peptides aggregate to form nuclei. Solution conditions play a great role in determining the rate of nucleation and the structure of the nucleus (17Ohhashi Y. Ito K. Toyama B.H. Weissman J.S. Tanaka M.

After nucleation, other peptides of the same amino acid sequence are recruited to the aggregate in a unidirectional manner, analogous to “one-dimensional crystallization.” Two main factors dictate the folding state, nucleation, and aggregation propensity of proteins: the primary sequence and environmental conditions (20Chi E.Y.

The question arises as to whether environmental factors, such as pH, co-solutes, shear, temperature, and ionic strength, can elicit these different aggregation states giving rise to different prion “strains” or “variants.” Prion strains have been extensively studied for the yeast prion protein Sup35p, the protein determinate of the [PSI+] prion (11Shorter J.

These different [PSI+] strains were shown to form at different rates (38Tanaka M. Collins S.R. Toyama B.H. Weissman J.S. The physical basis of how prion conformations determine strain phenotypes.Nature. 2006; 442: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), through different pathways (17Ohhashi Y. Ito K. Toyama B.H. Weissman J.S. Tanaka M. Differences in prion strain conformations result from non-native interactions in a nucleus.Nat. Chem.

The structural basis of yeast prion strain variants.Nature. 2007; 449: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Notably, phenotypically strong strains are characterized by less stable physical structure and shorter amyloid core region; the opposite is true of phenotypically weak strains. This is due to the fact that efficient prion propagation in vivo occurs via a chaperone-mediated fragmentation of aggregates that generates new seeds. Amyloids that are physically more stable are less efficiently fragmented and therefore are phenotypically weak (6Liebman S.W. Chernoff Y.O. Prions in yeast.Genetics. 2012; 191: 1041-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Similar to temperature, the ionic composition of the solution has been shown to affect aggregation kinetics in a number of amyloid-forming proteins, including α-synuclein (41Munishkina L.A.

The present work relates the differences in aggregation kinetics of Sup35NM caused by different salts to the structures and propagation parameters of amyloids formed in respective conditions. We find striking differences between aggregates formed in the presence of kosmotropes (well hydrated anions) versus chaotropes (poorly hydrated anions). Overall, our data show for the first time that the ionic composition of the solution modulates the structural patterns of nucleated amyloids. Sup35NM was heterologously produced in HMS174 (pLysS) Escherichia coli (Novagen) using a pET20b-SUP35NM-(His)6 expression vector as published previously (45Allen K.D. Wegrzyn R.D. Chernova T.A.

Purification on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was performed as described previously (18Yeh V. Broering J.M. Romanyuk A. Chen B. Chernoff Y.O. Bommarius A.S. The Hofmeister effect on amyloid formation using yeast prion protein.Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and then the purified protein was methanol precipitated at −20 °C. Purified protein was stored at −80 °C in 80% methanol. To polymerize, Sup35NM was resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 m of a given sodium salt to a final concentration of 10 μm and allowed to rotate at 20 rpm at room temperature for 48 h. Amyloid samples were frozen at −80 °C until used. Solutions of thioflavin T (Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared daily in PBS. Aggregation experiments were conducted in quadruplicate with final thioflavin T and Sup35NM concentrations of 100 and 10 μm, respectively, and containing a sodium salt. Polymerization was initiated by shaking samples at 18 Hz linearly at 27 °C in a BioTek Instruments Synergy H4 hybrid multi-mode microplate reader (Winooski, VT). Fluorescent readings were taken every 15 min for 12 h using an excitation wavelength of 440 nm and emission wavelength of 480 nm. Data were modeled using a nonlinear MATLAB sigmoidal curve fitting program (see the supplemental information). Amyloid samples were centrifuged and washed with deionized water to remove residual salt. Amyloids were resuspended in 100× diluted PBS. For SDS-PAGE gel entry assay, aggregates were held for 15 min in a preheated thermal block and then run on an acrylamide gel. Densitometry analysis was performed using ImageJ software. For the dynamic light scattering (DLS) 3The abbreviations used are: DLSdynamic light scatteringSDD-AGEsemidenaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresisTEMtransmission electron microscopyAFMatomic force microscopyScS and ScPS. cerevisiae Sup35NM amyloids formed in the presence of sulfate and perchlorate, respectively. technique, resuspended amyloids were sonicated and then, in a quartz cuvette, subjected to a temperature ramp protocol in a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Worcestershire, UK). Samples were capped with silicon oil to prevent solvent evaporation. The protocol increased the temperature linearly by 1 °C, equilibrated the sample for 2 min, and then took a single size measurement for 1 min. For these size measurements, the z-average of the amyloid diffusion coefficients was obtained from a second-order cumulant fit to the scattering intensity autocorrelation function and translated into a hydrodynamic diameter via the Stokes-Einstein relation. dynamic light scattering semidenaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis transmission electron microscopy atomic force microscopy S. cerevisiae Sup35NM amyloids formed in the presence of sulfate and perchlorate, respectively. SDD-AGE experiments were conducted according to previously published protocol (46Halfmann R. Lindquist S. Screening for amyloid aggregation by semi-denaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis.J. Vis. Exp. 2008; (pii): 838PubMed Google Scholar) except that 0.1% SDS was added to the transfer buffer. Electrophoretic mobility measurements were conducted using a Malvern ZS90 Zetasizer. Monomeric Sup35NM was suspended in water and pH-adjusted using very dilute NaOH or HCl solutions. The isoelectric points (pI) were determined by finding the pH at which the electrophoretic mobility was zero (i.e. the protein carried no net charge). For Sup35NM, the pI was found at pH 5.3 (data not shown). This finding indicates that at our operating pH of 7.4, Sup35NM carries a negative charge. Aggregates were first washed and resuspended in deionized water. For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, aggregates were adsorbed on Formvar carbon-coated 200 mesh copper grids by dropping 5 μl of protein solution onto the grid. Fibers were negatively stained using 2 μl of a 3% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution. After 60 s of staining, the sample was washed with deionized water and dried at 40 °C overnight. Images were acquired with a JEOL JEM 100CX II electron microscope operating at 100 kV. The microscope was equipped with a LaB6 filament and side-mounted 4.2 megapixel FLI CCD camera. Bright-field images were acquired at magnifications of 14,000–80,000× with a 300-μm second condenser aperture, 40-μm objective aperture, and “spot size” of 2. MaxIm DL software was used for imaging. For atomic force microscopy (AFM) samples, 20 μl of aggregate solution was allowed to adsorb onto freshly cleaved mica for 20 min. The sample was then washed and dried at room temperature overnight. Images were acquired using a Veeco Dimension 3100 AFM (Plainview, NY) with a >10-nm AppNano silicon tip in tapping mode. Measurement of individual fibers was conducted offline using NanoScope Analysis software. In vitro generated amyloid was washed with deionized water, sonicated, and then transfected into yeast along with a URA3 marker plasmid using a protocol described by Tanaka et al. (37Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S. Conformational variations in an infectious protein determine prion strain differences.Nature. 2004; 428: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 1 m dithiothreitol was added separately to the SCE (1 m sorbitol, 100 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm EDTA, pH 5.8) buffer to a final concentration of 10 mm; PEG buffer was prepared with 44% (w/v) PEG 3350; and top agar concentration was 0.8%, and it was incubated at 42 °C to prevent solidification. Transfectants were transferred to −ura selective medium and then velveteen replica-plated onto YPD for phenotypic characterization of strains. Successful transfection experiments using sonicated amyloid produced 20–30% [PSI+] colonies among all transfectants analyzed. When nonsonicated amyloids were transfected, the transfection efficiency dropped to ∼10% (data not shown). The S. cerevisiae strain GT17 (MATa ade1-14 (UGA) his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 [psi−] [pin−]) was used for all experiments (47Bailleul P.A. Newnam G.P. Steenbergen J.N. Chernoff Y.O. Genetic study of interactions between the cytoskeletal assembly protein Sla1 and prion-forming domain of the release factor Sup35 (eRF3) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1999; 153: 81-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GT17 contains a nonsense mutation ade1-14 (UGA) in the ADE1 gene, which causes premature translational termination of Ade1 protein synthesis in [psi−] cells. As a result, [psi−] cells cannot grow on media lacking adenine and appear red on YPD media due to buildup of an intermediate in the adenine biosynthetic pathway (6Liebman S.W. Chernoff Y.O. Prions in yeast.Genetics. 2012; 191: 1041-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In [PSI+] cells, Sup35 protein is sequestered in aggregates, and read-through of the nonsense mutation occurs. Read-through results in proper Ade1p expression, allowing for growth on media lacking adenine and a white phenotype on YPD. To detect biochemical differences between prion strains, a boiled gel assay was used that allows the comparison of the proportions of soluble and polymerized fractions of the Sup35 protein (48Kushnirov V.V. Alexandrov I.M. Mitkevich O.V. Shkundina I.S. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Purification and analysis of prion and amyloid aggregates.Methods. 2006; 39: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Monomeric protein can enter polyacrylamide, whereas aggregated protein remains trapped in the wells of the gel. After a short electrophoresis run, the wells were sealed with the new portion of polyacrylamide to prevent leakage, and the whole gel was boiled for 10 min to solubilize the trapped amyloid protein. Then, electrophoresis was resumed and followed by Western blot with the Sup35 antibody (kindly provided by D. Bedwell). Polymerized Sup35 is seen as the top band, whereas soluble Sup35 is seen as the bottom band. We first examined the effects of salt type and salt concentration on Sup35NM amyloid formation in vitro via a fluorescence assay using the amyloid-binding dye thioflavin T (49Wolfe L.S.

The classical sigmoidal shape of these data is indicative of nucleation-dependent aggregation. Nucleation-dependent aggregation is characterized by three phases: lag phase, fiber elongation, and mature fibril (11Shorter J. Lindquist S. Prions as adaptive conduits of memory and inheritance.Nat.

https://openalex.org/W2122972109,"The structure-function relationships of sugar transporter-receptor hGLUT2 coded by SLC2A2 and their impact on insulin secretion and β cell differentiation were investigated through the detailed characterization of a panel of mutations along the protein. We studied naturally occurring SLC2A2 variants or mutants: two single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four proposed inactivating mutations associated to Fanconi-Bickel syndrome. We also engineered mutations based on sequence alignment and conserved amino acids in selected domains. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms P68L and T110I did not impact on sugar transport as assayed in Xenopus oocytes. All the Fanconi-Bickel syndrome-associated mutations invalidated glucose transport by hGLUT2 either through absence of protein at the plasma membrane (G20D and S242R) or through loss of transport capacity despite membrane targeting (P417L and W444R), pointing out crucial amino acids for hGLUT2 transport function. In contrast, engineered mutants were located at the plasma membrane and able to transport sugar, albeit with modified kinetic parameters. Notably, these mutations resulted in gain of function. G20S and L368P mutations increased insulin secretion in the absence of glucose. In addition, these mutants increased insulin-positive cell differentiation when expressed in cultured rat embryonic pancreas. F295Y mutation induced β cell differentiation even in the absence of glucose, suggesting that mutated GLUT2, as a sugar receptor, triggers a signaling pathway independently of glucose transport and metabolism. Our results describe the first gain of function mutations for hGLUT2, revealing the importance of its receptor versus transporter function in pancreatic β cell development and insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1987433975,"The nonspecific binding of heparin to plasma proteins compromises its anticoagulant activity by reducing the amount of heparin available to bind antithrombin. In addition, interaction of heparin with fibrin promotes formation of a ternary heparin-thrombin-fibrin complex that protects fibrin-bound thrombin from inhibition by the heparin-antithrombin complex. Previous studies have shown that heparin binds the E domain of fibrinogen. The current investigation examines the role of Zn(2+) in this interaction because Zn(2+) is released locally by platelets and both heparin and fibrinogen bind the cation, resulting in greater protection from inhibition by antithrombin. Zn(2+) promotes heparin binding to fibrinogen, as determined by chromatography, fluorescence, and surface plasmon resonance. Compared with intact fibrinogen, there is reduced heparin binding to fragment X, a clottable plasmin degradation product of fibrinogen. A monoclonal antibody directed against a portion of the fibrinogen αC domain removed by plasmin attenuates binding of heparin to fibrinogen and a peptide analog of this region binds heparin in a Zn(2+)-dependent fashion. These results indicate that the αC domain of fibrinogen harbors a Zn(2+)-dependent heparin binding site. As a consequence, heparin-catalyzed inhibition of factor Xa by antithrombin is compromised by fibrinogen to a greater extent when Zn(2+) is present. These results reveal the mechanism by which Zn(2+) augments the capacity of fibrinogen to impair the anticoagulant activity of heparin."

Although it is commonly assumed that the ts phenotype of a specific mutation arises from thermal denaturation of the mutant enzyme, the possibility also exists that the mutation decreases the enzyme activity to a certain level at the permissive temperature and aggravates the negative effect further upon temperature upshifts. Resolving these possibilities is important for exploiting the ts mutation for studying the essential gene. The trmD gene is essential for growth in bacteria, encoding the enzyme for converting G37 to m1G37 on the 3′ side of the tRNA anticodon.

Using the ts-S88L mutation of Escherichia coli trmD as an example, we show that although the mutation confers thermal lability to the enzyme, the effect is relatively minor. In contrast, the mutation decreases the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme to 1% at the permissive temperature, and at the nonpermissive temperature, it renders further deterioration of activity to 0.1%. These changes are accompanied by losses of both the quantity and quality of tRNA methylation, leading to the potential of cellular pleiotropic effects.

Such alleles are typically mis-sense mutations, which preserve the gene function at permissive and low temperatures but inactivate the gene function upon temperature upshifts. The study of ts phenotypes is fundamental and important for insight into gene essentiality. However, the molecular basis of ts phenotypes of essential genes remains poorly understood; although it is generally assumed that such phenotypes result from thermal inactivation of gene products, the possibility that they arise from inherent functional defects that become lethal at higher temperatures is often overlooked. In the latter case, ts mutations giving rise to severe functional defects at the permissive temperature can be powerful tools to study essential genes and to correlate phenotypes with mechanisms of gene inactivation. temperature-sensitive S-adenosyl methionine S-adenosyl homocysteine kanamycin.

In one genetic study of Salmonella typhimurium, several ts mutants of trmD were isolated for the deficiency in m1G37-tRNA synthesis, resulting in changes in the thiamine metabolism flux (9.Björk G.R. Nilsson K. 1-Methylguanosine-deficient tRNA of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium affects thiamine metabolism.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the trmD deficiency at the restrictive temperature of these mutants reduced the m1G37-tRNA level, such that ribosome translation at codons normally read by the modified tRNA was slow, thus inactivating gene expression in the normal thiamine biosynthesis pathway while activating expression in an alternative pathway. This study showed that the deficiency of trmD had altered the profile of global gene expression, consistent with increasing evidence indicating that tRNA modifications often have regulatory and stress-response roles at genome-wide levels (10.Yi C. Pan T. Cellular dynamics of RNA modification.Acc. Chem. Res. 2011; 44: 1380-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although the isolated ts-trmD mutants had been confirmed for the deficiency in m1G37-tRNA synthesis (9.Björk G.R. Nilsson K. 1-Methylguanosine-deficient tRNA of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium affects thiamine metabolism.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), none had been characterized at the structural level for locations, at the molecular level for thermal instability, or at the enzyme level for catalytic defect. To gain insight into these mutations, we have mapped their locations onto the known structure of E. coli TrmD (EcTrmD) in complex with S-adenosyl homocysteine (AdoHcy), the product after methyl transfer (11.Elkins P.A. Watts J.M. Zalacain M. van Thiel A. Vitazka P.R. Redlak M. Andraos-Selim C. Rastinejad F. Holmes W.M. Insights into catalysis by a knotted TrmD tRNA methyltransferase.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 931-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). From this mapping, we selected for further analysis of the S88L mutation, which is placed closely adjacent to the S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet)-binding site. Remarkably, TrmD binds AdoMet in a topologically knotted trefoil fold, involving the protein backbone making three passes in and out of a tightly folded loop (11.Elkins P.A. Watts J.M. Zalacain M. van Thiel A. Vitazka P.R. Redlak M. Andraos-Selim C. Rastinejad F. Holmes W.M. Insights into catalysis by a knotted TrmD tRNA methyltransferase.J. Mol.

Insights into tRNA recognition.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The location of the S88L mutation within the trefoil knot is attractive for interrogating the molecular basis of its temperature sensitivity. We report here that although the S88L mutation indeed confers susceptibility to thermal denaturation, the effect is rather minor. Instead, the mutation markedly decreases the enzyme activity relative to the native sequence at the permissive temperature, and it causes further deterioration of activity upon temperature upshifts. We further show that the decrease in the enzyme activity is correlated with decrease in the level of tRNA methylation and the quality of tRNA recognition, suggesting the possibility of accumulating frameshift errors during protein synthesis and altering global gene expression. We suggest that it is the loss of the catalytic efficiency of TrmD by the S88L mutation, and consequently the increase of protein synthesis errors, that is the driving force for the lethal phenotype at the restrictive temperature. This work demonstrates that ts phenotypes can be closely correlated with catalytic defects of an essential gene product and that such correlation can provide unique insight into the function of the essential gene in vivo and the mechanism of action in vitro. The S88L-trmD mutation was isolated with a ts phenotype in Salmonella (25.Björk G.R. Jacobsson K. Nilsson K. Johansson M.J. Byström A.S. Persson O.P. A primordial tRNA modification required for the evolution of life?.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We introduced this mutation to the chromosomal trmD gene of E. coli Xac strain, using the λ Red recombinase-mediated gene disruption method (16.Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. One-step inactivation of chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli K-12 using PCR products.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11130) Google Scholar). We inserted the E. coli wt-trmD gene to the pQE-30 vector and introduced the ts-S88L mutation, by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The modified coding sequence was amplified by PCR using the following primer set: 5′-ATGTGGATTGGCATAATTAGCCTGTTTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAACTTCGAAGCAGCTCCAGCCTACACTTACGCCATCCCATCATGTTTATG-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was purified and amplified again according to the megaprimer method (34.Chen J.R. Lü J.J. Wang H.F. Rapid and efficient gene splicing using megaprimer-based protocol.Mol. Biotechnol. 2008; 40: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) in a mixture containing the first PCR product, the kanamycin resistance cassette plasmid pKD4, and the third primer, 5′-ATCCTGGGTAAACTGATATCTCGGGGGCATGGGAATTAGCCATGGTCCATATG-3′. The final PCR product, together with pKD46 (the λ Red recombinase plasmid), was introduced to E. coli Xac strain and colonies were selected on LB-Kan plates. The mutation was verified by sequence analysis, and the temperature sensitivity and curing of pKD46 was confirmed. In parallel, a wt-trmD-Kan construct was made as a control. The quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of EcTrmD by AdoMet binding was determined as described (17.Christian T. Lahoud G. Liu C. Hou Y.M. Control of catalytic cycle by a pair of analogous tRNA modification enzymes.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 400: 204-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The WT enzyme was titrated at 0.2 μm with AdoMet ranging from 0.2 to 4.5 μm, whereas the S88L mutant enzyme was titrated at 2.0 μm with AdoMet ranging from 1.5 to 22 μm. Enzyme fluorescence was excited at 280 nm in the standard buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 6 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl), and emission was monitored at 320–340 nm at room temperature. Inner filter corrections were calculated by the equation: Fc/Fo = anti-log [(Aex + Aem)/2], where Fc is the dilution-corrected fluorescence, Fo is the observed fluorescence, and Aex and Aem are the absorbencies at the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Nonspecific quenching was measured by titrating AdoMet against a solution of l-Trp. Data corrected after inner filter effects and nonspecific quenching were fit to a hyperbolic equation: y = A × S/(S + Kd), where y is the change in fluorescence from the reference point, A is the maximum change in amplitude, and S is the AdoMet concentration. E. coli cells harboring wt or S88L-trmD were grown in LB medium overnight at 30 °C. A fresh culture was inoculated with the overnight culture at 1:100-fold dilution and continued to grow for 3–4 h at 30 °C until A600 = ∼0.3. The culture was split into two, with one shifted to 43 °C by mixing with an equal volume of LB at 55 °C while the other was maintained at 30 °C by mixing with an equal volume of LB at 30 °C. Aliquots of each culture were sampled up to 24 h. Cell viability was determined by directly plating the cell culture at each time point with appropriate dilution. The plates were incubated at 30 or 43 °C, respectively, for additional 12–14 h. The number of colonies formed was normalized by A600 and shown as relative to the time of split. E. coli cells were grown as above. Each aliquot of cell culture was spun down, and the cells were disrupted by sonication to separate the lysate from debris. The lysate was directly used to measure enzyme activity in the TrmD reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 24 mm NH4Cl, 4 mm DTT, 100 μm EDTA, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.024 mg/ml BSA, 40 units/sample RNasin (Promega)) at 30 or 43 °C, using EctRNAPro as the substrate at 5-fold or lower concentration of Km. The A37 mutant of EctRNAPro, which was not a TrmD substrate, was used to measure methyl transfer to non-G37 positions. [3H-methyl]AdoMet (25 μm) was used, and the synthesis of [3H]m1G37-tRNA was monitored by acid precipitation (35.Christian T. Evilia C. Williams S. Hou Y.M. Distinct origins of tRNA(m1G37) methyltransferase.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The initial rate of m1G37-tRNA synthesis was normalized by A600 and shown as relative to the time of culture split. Because the endogenous level of TrmD is very low in E. coli (28.Wikström P.M. Björk G.R. Noncoordinate translation-level regulation of ribosomal and nonribosomal protein genes in the Escherichia coli trmD operon.J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3025-3031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we used E. coli strain SG13009 overexpressing the WT or S88L-TrmD from the plasmid pQE30. Cells were grown in LB medium at 30 °C for an hour and then split into three cultures, each at 30, 37, or 43 °C. After 8 h of growth, when the mutant TrmD was inactivated at the restrictive temperatures (see Fig. 5), cells were harvested and sonicated, the soluble cell lysates were collected, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. Total protein (10 μg) of each cell lysate was loaded to a 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon PVDF membrane (Millipore), and reacted with the primary antibody raised against StTrmD (given by Dr. Glenn Björk). The membrane was incubated with the anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich), and the signal was detected using SuperSignal West Pico (Thermo Scientific) and quantified by ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). Two independent experiments were performed to report the average signal of TrmD at 37 and 43 relative to 30 °C. Errors are standard deviations. E. coli wt- and S88L-trmD cells were grown at 30 °C to A600 of 0.3 and then shifted to 43 °C or maintained at 30 °C for 10 h. Total RNA was isolated from each cell culture, and the native E. coli tRNALeu/CAG was purified by a biotin-tagged oligonucleotide specific to the D loop region (36.Yokogawa T. Kitamura Y. Nakamura D. Ohno S. Nishikawa K. Optimization of the hybridization-based method for purification of thermostable tRNAs in the presence of tetraalkylammonium salts.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: e89Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The purified native tRNALeu/CAG was tested by the RNaseH assay (24.Hou Y.M. Li Z. Gamper H. Isolation of a site-specifically modified RNA from an unmodified transcript.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e21Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), using a DNA oligonucleotide complementary to the region of nucleotides from positions 31 to 46. RNaseH-treated tRNAs were separated on a 12% PAGE, 7 m urea. The fractions of intact tRNA and cleaved fragments were estimated based on ethidium bromide staining. Enzyme was purified by affinity resin and by FPLC, and concentration was determined by UV absorption for CD analysis. Spectra were measured on a JASCO spectrometer J-810 equipped with JASCO Peltier thermo controller. For the wavelength scan, a cuvette with 1-mm path length was used. Each sample (1 μm dimer) in the CD buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3 mm MgCl2, and 24 mm NH4Cl) was preincubated at 30 or 43 °C for 10 min, and then the spectrum was recorded from 260 to 200 nm at each temperature. Scan speed was 10 nm/min, response was 32 s, and bandwidth was 2 nm. Each spectrum was the average of four runs, and the average of two spectra for each sample was presented. For the temperature scan, a cuvette with 10-mm path length was used. The spectrum of each sample (0.1 μm) in the CD buffer was recorded from 15 to 75 °C at 222 nm. Temperature raise was 24 °C/hour, response was 32 s, and bandwidth was 1 nm. Calculation of α-helical content was based on the equation: % helix = (Δϵ220 − 0.25)/0.105, where Δϵ220 is the measured circular dichroism at 220 nm derived from [θ] = 3330 Δϵ as previously reported (37.Clark D.J. Hill C.S. Martin S.R. Thomas J.O. α-Helix in the carboxy-terminal domains of histones H1 and H5.EMBO J. 1988; 7: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). WT and the S88L mutant of EcTrmD enzymes, each with an N-His tag, were expressed from pQE30 in E. coli SG13009. Enzymes from one liter of culture were purified using HisLink (Promega). Steady-state kinetic assays were performed as described (35.Christian T. Evilia C. Williams S. Hou Y.M. Distinct origins of tRNA(m1G37) methyltransferase.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Each tRNA sample (ranging in final concentration from 1.0 to 128.0 μm) was heat-denatured and annealed before use. Each reaction contained tRNA and saturating [3H-methyl]AdoMet (25 μm) in the standard buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 6 mm MgCl2, 24 mm NH4Cl, and 0.024 mg/ml BSA) and was initiated by addition of the WT or mutant enzyme at final concentrations 0.025 to 1.5 μm. Aliquots were taken at every 2 min up to 10 min and precipitated by 5% (w/v) TCA on filter pads. Methyl transfer was determined by quantification of [3H] incorporation into acid precipitable counts. After correction of the filter quenching factor, the data of initial rate as a function of tRNA concentration were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the KaleidaGraph software (Synergy software) to determine the Km, kcat, and kcat/Km values. Each value was the average of at least three independent measurements. Errors are standard deviations. Discrimination analysis between G36- and C36-EctRNALeu was performed in the same buffer. Data for the G36-tRNA was obtained from Table 1. For the C36-tRNA, the WT enzyme was assayed at 1.0 μm with 16.0 and 20.0 μm of tRNA at 30 and 43 °C, respectively, whereas the S88L mutant enzyme was assayed at 1.0 μm with 16 μm tRNA at 30 °C and at 2.6 μm with 50 μm tRNA at 43 °C. Each enzyme-tRNA condition was in the kcat/Km range. Aliquots were taken at every 5 min up to 25 min at 30 °C and at every 10 min up to 50 min at 43 °C. Samples were processed as above, and the initial rate of each reaction (pmol/s) was obtained. The value of kcat/Km (μm−1 s−1) was calculated by dividing the initial rate by the enzyme amount and the tRNA concentration. For all kinetic assays, each value was the average of at least two to three independent measurements, and standard deviations are reported.TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic parameters of TrmD on EctRNALeuWT-TrmDS88L-TrmD30 °C37 °C43 °C30 °C37 °C43 °CKm (μm)2.4 ± 0.43.1 ± 0.321.7 ± 4.313.0 ± 1.152.2 ± 4.662.5 ± 12.8kcat (s−1)(4.9 ± 0.2) × 10−2(9.3 ± 0.9) × 10−2(1.3 ± 0.1) × 10−1(3.2 ± 0.3) × 10−3(6.7 ± 0.4) × 10−3(1.5 ± 0.2) × 10−3kcat/Km (μm−1 s−1)(2.0 ± 0.4) × 10−2(3.0 ± 0.4) × 10−2(5.9 ± 1.2) × 10−3(2.4 ± 0.3) × 10−4(1.3 ± 0.1) × 10−4(2.5 ± 0.6) × 10−5kcat/Km ratio1.001.460.290.0120.00640.0012 Open table in a new tab A genetic study led by Björk and Nilsson (9.Björk G.R. Nilsson K. 1-Methylguanosine-deficient tRNA of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium affects thiamine metabolism.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) isolated a group of ts mutations in S. typhimurium TrmD (StTrmD) that conferred altered thiamine metabolism at a restrictive temperature (P58L/L94F, S88L, G117S, G117N, G117Q, S165L, P184L, G199R, G214D, W217D, and E243K). A separate study by Li and Björk (13.Li J.N. Björk G.R. Structural alterations of the tRNA(m1G37)methyltransferase from Salmonella typhimurium affect tRNA substrate specificity.RNA. 1999; 5: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) isolated additional ts mutants (E243K, L94F, P184L, G140S, and A145T) that displayed elevated levels of frameshift errors caused by the deficiency in m1G37-tRNA. The two groups of mutants showed overlapping amino acid substitutions at the protein level and collectively occupied 12 positions in the StTrmD enzyme structure. Because these mutations were isolated before the structure of TrmD was available, nothing was known about their structural context. We now mapped these mutations onto the crystal structure of EcTrmD in complex with AdoHcy (11.Elkins P.A. Watts J.M. Zalacain M. van Thiel A. Vitazka P.R. Redlak M. Andraos-Selim C. Rastinejad F. Holmes W.M. Insights into catalysis by a knotted TrmD tRNA methyltransferase.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 931-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which was a logical model based on the over 92% homology in the primary sequence between the S. typhimurium and E. coli enzymes. Although TrmD exists as an obligated homodimer, with each subunit featuring an N-terminal domain (residues 1–159), a flexible linker (residues 160–169), and a C-terminal domain (residues 170–250), the active site is built between the N-terminal domain of one subunit and the flexible linker and the C-terminal domain of the other. In this intriguing cross-subunit active site, AdoMet is bound to the trefoil knot fold in the N-terminal domain, whereas the target G37 is predicted to bind to the flexible linker (11.Elkins P.A. Watts J.M. Zalacain M. van Thiel A. Vitazka P.R. Redlak M. Andraos-Selim C. Rastinejad F. Holmes W.M. Insights into catalysis by a knotted TrmD tRNA methyltransferase.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 931-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the active site cannot be precisely depicted, because the flexible linker is disordered and invisible in structures that lack tRNA (12.Ahn H.J. Kim H.W. Yoon H.J. Lee B.I. Suh S.W. Yang J.K. Crystal structure of tRNA(m1G37)methyltransferase. Insights into tRNA recognition.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), including the EcTrmD structure (11.Elkins P.A. Watts J.M. Zalacain M. van Thiel A. Vitazka P.R. Redlak M. Andraos-Selim C. Rastinejad F. Holmes W.M. Insights into catalysis by a knotted TrmD tRNA methyltransferase.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 931-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This prevented the mapping of the S165L mutation. To the rest of the mutations, we found that those localized to the N-terminal domain were near the AdoMet binding site, whereas those localized to the C-terminal domain were in helical regions (Fig. 1). We focused on mutations near the AdoMet binding site to provide a structural framework for interpreting mutational effects. In this framework, AdoMet is bound at the deep end of the trefoil knot fold, which is initiated with a β strand (β4) in the central β sheet structure of the N-terminal domain. The β4 curves around through α4 and β5 and turns into α5 and then into β6, which makes a circular insertion into the loop (Fig. 1A). Within this knot, AdoMet adopts a distinctively bent conformation that places the adenosine and methionine moieties facing each other, which is rare among AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases (12.Ahn H.J. Kim H.W. Yoon H.J. Lee B.I. Suh S.W. Yang J.K. Crystal structure of tRNA(m1G37)methyltransferase. Insights into tRNA recognition.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14.Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Many paths to methyltransfer. A chronicle of convergence.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 329-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). During methyl transfer, the AdoMet-binding site is presumably “capped” by the flexible linker provided by the C-terminal domain of the other monomer. Proteins with a knotted fold, such as the trefoil knot in TrmD, are rare but are known to have an inherent rigidity not present in unknotted proteins (15.King N.P. Jacobitz A.W. Sawaya M.R. Goldschmidt L. Yeates T.O. Structure and folding of a designed knotted protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 20732-20737Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Of the mutations localized to near the AdoMet site, some were discovered together in one mutant (e.g., P58L and L94F), whereas others were discovered in multiple mutants each with a distinct substitution (e.g., G117S, G117N, and G117Q). We chose to study the S88L mutation, which was discovered in one mutant at a single position. The natural S88 residue is at a position highly conserved among Gram-negative TrmD enzymes but not conserved in Gram-positive (Fig. 2A), indicating the possibility of differential roles in the two classes of bacteria. In the EcTrmD structure, S88 is placed in the beginning of the loop emanating from the central β4 that stabilizes the knot (Fig. 2B). The S88L mutation is therefore attractive for interrogating the molecular basis of its ts phenotypes, because on the one hand it is expected to interfere with AdoMet binding, because of the replacement of the smaller side chain"

https://openalex.org/W2138367192,"BDNF positively influences various aspects of neuronal migration, maturation, and survival in the developing brain. Reelin in turn mediates inhibitory signals to migrating neuroblasts, which is crucial for brain development. The interplay between BDNF and Reelin signaling in neurodevelopment is not fully understood. We show here that BDNF increased the levels of the Reelin receptor (VLDL receptor (VLDLR)) in hippocampal neurons by increasing gene expression. In contrast, Reelin decreased VLDLRs, which was accompanied by an increase in the levels of the E3 ligase Mylip/Idol in neurons. Down-regulation of Mylip/Idol using shRNAs abrogated the decrease in VLDLRs induced by Reelin. These results show that VLDLRs are tightly regulated in hippocampal neurons by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. The regulation of VLDLR by BDNF and Reelin may affect the migration of neurons and contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders in the nervous system."

We produced three proteins, DD1, DD2, and tandem DD1/DD2 (DD1+DD2), and characterized their binding ability. Transition temperature of thermal unfolding (Tm) of each protein was elevated by the addition of cello-, laminari-, chitin-, or chitosan-hexamer (GlcN)6.

Chitosanases (EC 3.2.1.132) are glycosidases acting toward the β-1,4-glycosidic linkages of glucosamine (GlcN) polysaccharide chitosan (1Monaghan R.L. Eveleigh D.E. Tewari R.P. Reese E.T. Chitosanase, a novel enzyme.Nat. New Biol. 1973; 245: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which is related to chitin and cellulose with respect to their chemical structures. Artificial chitosan has been prepared from chitin on an industrial scale by de-N-acetylation with sodium hydroxide (2Synowiecki J. Al-Khateeb N.A. Production, properties, and some new applications of chitin and its derivatives.Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 2003; 43: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar).

In addition, chitin and cellulose mostly occur as a crystalline state, whereas chitosans are amorphous. Therefore, in enzymatic degradation of the chitosan polysaccharide, there may be some aspects that are different from those found in chitin and cellulose degradation (5Igarashi K. Uchihashi T. Koivula A. Wada M. Kimura S. Okamoto T. Penttilä M. Ando T. Samejima M.

According to the CAZy database (8Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. The Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes database (CAZy). An expert resource for glycogenomics.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 37: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar), CBMs have been classified into 67 families based on their amino acid sequences. However, Boraston et al. (7Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Carbohydrate-binding modules. Fine-tuning polysaccharide recognition.Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar) categorized CBMs into three types, Type A, Type B, and Type C, based on the state of the carbohydrate binding site. Type A CBMs bind to the flat surface of insoluble polysaccharides, but polysaccharides bind to the long-extended carbohydrate binding groove of Type B CBMs. Type C CBMs bind a small sugar, such as a mono-, di-, or trisaccharide. Insoluble and highly crystalline chitin and cellulose provide the flat surface, which is complementary to the planar architecture composed of some aromatic side chains of CBMs (9Kezuka Y. Ohishi M.

Biol. 2006; 358: 472-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This type of CBM belongs to Type A. If a CBM specific to chitosan is present, it is unlikely to belong to Type A but instead to B or C because of the amorphous nature of chitosan.

IK-5 has two DDs (DD1 and DD2) belonging to CBM32 at its C terminus as shown in Fig. 1A. This chitosanase was also found to lose its chitosan binding ability upon truncations of DDs (18Kimoto H. Akamatsu M. Fujii Y. Tatsumi H. Kusaoke H. Taketo A. Discoidin domain of chitosanase is required for binding to the fungal cell wall.J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010; 18: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It appears that DD1 and DD2 are a novel type of CBM32 protein specific to chitosan. In this study we produced three proteins, DD1, DD2, and a protein comprising DD1 and DD2 in tandem (DD1+DD2), using an Escherichia coli expression system. The three proteins were employed for thermal unfolding experiments, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and NMR titration experiments to elucidate their function. Chitosan oligosaccharides (GlcN)n (n = 2–6), chitin hexasaccharide (GlcNAc)6, cello-hexasaccharide 1,4(Glc)6, and laminari-hexasaccharide 1,3(Glc)6 were purchased from Seikagaku Biobusiness Co. (Tokyo, Japan). E. coli BL21(DE3) pLacI and Rosetta (DE3) pLacI cells and the expression vector pETBlue-1 were from Novagen (Madison, WI). Nickel affinity resin, COSMOGEL His-Accept, was purchased from Nacalai Tesque Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Sephacryl S-100 HR was from GE Healthcare. All other reagents were of analytic grade. The gene encoding DD1, DD2, or DD1+DD2 fused with a His6 tag was amplified by PCR, which was conducted using the full-length gene of a GH8 chitosanase from Paenibacillus sp. IK-5 (formerly Paenibacillus fukuinensis D2) (17Kimoto H. Kusaoke H. Yamamoto I. Fujii Y. Onodera T. Taketo A.

PCR products were purified and ligated into the pETBlue-1 vector by TA-cloning (pETB-DD1, pETB-DD2, and pETB-DD1+DD2). After confirmation of the cDNA sequences, pETB-DD1, pETB-DD2, and pETB-DD1+DD2 were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) pLacI, Rosetta(DE3) pLacI, and Rosetta(DE3) pLacI, respectively. E. coli cells harboring the plasmid, pETB-DD1, pETB-DD2, or pETB-DD1+DD2 were grown to attain 0.6 optical density at 600 nm before induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After induction, growth was continued for 18 h at 18 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in a 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and disrupted with a sonicator. After cell debris was removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 15 min), the supernatant was dialyzed against the same buffer and applied onto a nickel-affinity column (1 × 2 cm) equilibrated with dialysis buffer. The column was washed with the same buffer, and adsorbed proteins were eluted with a 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 250 mm imidazole. The fractions eluted were pooled and further separated using a column of Sephacryl S-100 HR equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl. Fractions exhibiting a single protein band on SDS-PAGE were collected as a purified recombinant protein. Protein concentrations were determined by reading absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficients 39,420 (DD1), 40,190 (DD2), and 80,330 (DD1+DD2) m−1 cm−1, calculated from the equation proposed by Pace et al. (19Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. How to measure and predict the molar absorption coefficient of a protein.Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar). To obtain the thermal unfolding curve of the protein, the CD value at 222 nm was monitored using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (cell length 0.1 cm), whereas the solution temperature was raised at a rate of 1 °C/min using a temperature controller (PTC-423L, Jasco). To facilitate comparisons between unfolding curves, experimental data were normalized as follows. The fraction of unfolded protein at each temperature was calculated from the CD value by linearly extrapolating pre- and post-transition base lines into the transition zone, and those were plotted against the temperature. Final concentrations of the enzyme and (GlcN)n were 5 μm and 5 mm, respectively. The DD1 or DD2 solution (80–90 μm) in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) was degassed, and its concentration was determined. Individual (GlcN)n (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) (1.5 mm) were dissolved in the same buffer, and the solution pH was adjusted to 5.0. Then the (GlcN)n solution was degassed and loaded into a syringe, whereas the protein solution (0.2028 ml) was loaded into the sample cell after confirming the solution pH 5.0. Protein and ligand concentrations for DD1+DD2 were set at 31 μm and 0.5 mm, respectively. In measurements at pH 7.0, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer was used instead of the acetate buffer. Calorimetric titration was performed with an iTC200 system (Microcal, Northampton, MA) at 25 °C. Aliquots (1.0–2.0 μl) of the ligand solution were added to the sample cell with a stirring speed of 1000 rpm. Titrations were completed after 19–39 injections. When titration experiments were performed with c values from 10 to 100 (c = n·Kassoc·[M]t; where n is the stoichiometry, Kassoc is the association constant, and [M]t is the initial protein concentration), Kassoc values obtained can be regarded as reliable (20Wiseman T.

Titration of GlcN to DD1 yielded a c value of 0.2 and those for DD2 yielded 0.3∼3.4, whereas the c values for the other titration experiments were in the region 10 < c < 100. Binding thermodynamics can be obtained using ITC even when c is in the range 0.01 < c < 10 if the requirements proposed by Turnbull and Daranas (21Turnbull W.B. Daranas A.H. On the value of c. Can low affinity systems be studied by isothermal titration calorimetry?.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14859-14866Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) are satisfied. We confirmed that all requirements were fulfilled in our experiments except the titration of GlcN monomer to DD1. Thus, the thermodynamic data for the GlcN titration to DD1 are not presented (Table 2), but only the ITC profile is presented here (see Fig. 3F).TABLE 2Thermodynamic parameters for chitosan oligosaccharide binding to DD1 and DD2 obtained from ITC profiles shown in Fig. 3ProteinLigandnKassocaa S.E. were obtained from the nonlinear least square fitting shown in the bottom figures of the panels of Fig. 3.ΔHr°aa S.E. were obtained from the nonlinear least square fitting shown in the bottom figures of the panels of Fig. 3.ΔSr°−TΔSr°ΔGr°m−1kcal/molcal/mol/degkcal/molkcal/molDD1(GlcN)61.2 ± 0.1(5.3 ± 0.2) × 105−10.0 ± 0.1−7.22.2−7.8(GlcN)6bb The data were obtained in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.1.0 ± 0.1bb The data were obtained in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.((8.0 ± 0.2) × 105bb The data were obtained in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.−13.8 ± 0.1bb The data were obtained in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.−19.4bb The data were obtained in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.5.8bb The data were obtained in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.−8.0bb The data were obtained in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.(GlcN)51.2 ± 0.1(3.7 ± 0.1) × 105−8.2 ± 0.1−2.00.6−7.6(GlcN)41.2 ± 0.1(3.6 ± 0.3) × 105−8.2 ± 0.1−1.80.5−7.6(GlcN)31.3 ± 0.1(3.9 ± 0.2) × 105−7.5 ± 0.10.4−0.1−7.6(GlcN)21.1 ± 0.1(1.4 ± 0.1) × 105−8.9 ± 0.1−6.11.8−7.1DD2(GlcN)61.0cc The n values were fixed in the optimization process because the values for (GlcN)3 and (GlcN)6 to DD1 were determined to be ∼1.0.(6.5 ± 0.1) × 103−10.0 ± 0.1−164.8−5.2(GlcN)6bb The data were obtained in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.0.9 ± 0.1(3.9 ± 0.2) × 104bb The data were obtained in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.−12.2 ± 0.2bb The data were obtained in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.−20.0bb The data were obtained in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.5.9bb The data were obtained in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.−6.3bb The data were obtained in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.(GlcN)31.0cc The n values were fixed in the optimization process because the values for (GlcN)3 and (GlcN)6 to DD1 were determined to be ∼1.0.(5.2 ± 0.2) × 103−10.1 ± 0.2−4.95.1−5.0a a S.E. were obtained from the nonlinear least square fitting shown in the bottom figures of the panels of Fig. 3.b b The data were obtained in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.c c The n values were fixed in the optimization process because the values for (GlcN)3 and (GlcN)6 to DD1 were determined to be ∼1.0.

NMR samples contained 0.2–0.5 mm protein in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0 (90% H2O/10% D2O). All NMR spectra were acquired at 300 K using a Bruker AV500 spectrometer controlled with TopSpin 3.0 software and equipped with a triple-resonance pulsed-field-gradient cryoprobe head. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to HDO (4.64 ppm at 30 °C) relative to trimethylsilyl propanoic acid. 15N and 13C chemical shifts were indirectly calibrated from each gyromagnetic ratio (22Wishart D.S.

Sequential assignments were performed using 15N/13C-labeled DD1 and DD2 from two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC and three-dimensional HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCA, HNCACO, HNCO, and HNCOCA experiments; All spectra were processed using NMRPipe software (23Delaglio F.

University of California, San Francisco, CA2004Google Scholar). Two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC spectra were recorded for 0.25 mm 15N-labeled DD1 or DD2 in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0; 90% H2O/10%D2O) in the presence of various concentrations of (GlcN)n. Chemical shift changes induced by oligosaccharide binding (Δδ) were calculated by the equation Δδ={(ΔNH2+ΔN2/25)/2}1/2(eq.1) where ΔNH and ΔN represent the observed shifts in the 1H axis and 15N axis, respectively. Amino acid residues, whose resonances disappeared or shifted more than 0.05 ppm (Δδ) at the saturated concentration of the ligand, were visualized on the protein surface of the modeled DD1 and DD2 structures to estimate the interaction sites. Because the interaction between the protein and (GlcN)n was a fast or intermediate exchange, Δδ values relative to the maximum shift (Δδmax) were plotted against the free oligosaccharide concentrations, and the association constant, Kassoc, was estimated by nonlinear curve-fitting based on the equation Δδ/Δδmax=[S]free/([S]free+1/Kassoc)(eq.2) Free oligosaccharide concentrations [S]free were obtained by subtracting the bound oligosaccharide concentration [ES] from the total oligosaccharide concentration [S]total. To select an appropriate template for molecular modeling of the three-dimensional structures of DD1 and DD2, the DD1 sequence was submitted to BLAST searches with respect to the PDB database.

Thus, four different protonation states were assumed for DD1 as follows: (i) both residues are deprotonated, (ii) Glu-14 is protonated and Glu-36 is deprotonated, (iii) Glu-14 is deprotonated and Glu-36 is protonated, or (iv) both residues are protonated. In the case of DD2, because there is only one acidic residue (Glu-14) in the binding region, two protonation states were assumed: (i) Glu-14 is protonated, or (ii) Glu-14 is deprotonated. The d-glucosamine dimer, (GlcN)2, was employed as a ligand. Its structure was obtained from the crystal structure of Amycolatopsis orientalis exo-chitosanase (CsxA) complexed with (GlcN)2 (PDB code 2VZV) (31van Bueren A.L. Ghinet M.G. Gregg K. Fleury A.

The lowest energy structures and structures with a higher frequency were then selected for each protonation state. The selected structures were superimposed using PyMOL v.0.9.9. Thermal unfolding curves of DD1, DD2, and DD1+DD2 were obtained by monitoring CD at 222 nm, as shown in Fig. 2. The transition temperature of thermal unfolding (Tm) of DD1 was elevated upon the addition of (GlcN)6 (ΔTm = 10.3 °C), cello-hexamer (ΔTm = 2.5 °C), laminari-hexamer (ΔTm = 6.0 °C), or chitin hexamer (ΔTm = 1.3 °C). However, the values of ΔTm for DD2 were much lower than those for DD1 as listed in Table 1. The interactions of the oligosaccharides with DD1 were markedly stronger than those with DD2. Among the oligosaccharides tested, (GlcN)6 enhanced the stability of DD1 most intensively, indicating that DD1 is most specific to chitosan.

https://openalex.org/W2100326161,"Invasion of human intestinal epithelial cells (HCT-8) by Cryptosporidium parvum resulted in a rapid induction of host cell spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (hSSAT-1) mRNA, causing a 4-fold increase in SSAT-1 enzyme activity after 24 h of infection. In contrast, host cell SSAT-2, spermine oxidase, and acetylpolyamine oxidase (hAPAO) remained unchanged during this period. Intracellular polyamine levels of C. parvum-infected human epithelial cells were determined, and it was found that spermidine remained unchanged and putrescine increased by 2.5-fold after 15 h and then decreased after 24 h, whereas spermine decreased by 3.9-fold after 15 h. Concomitant with these changes, N1-acetylspermine and N1-acetylspermidine both increased by 115- and 24-fold, respectively. Increased SSAT-1 has previously been shown to be involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response leading to apoptosis. Several stress response proteins were increased in HCT-8 cells infected with C. parvum, including calreticulin, a major calcium-binding chaperone in the ER; GRP78/BiP, a prosurvival ER chaperone; and Nrf2, a transcription factor that binds to antioxidant response elements, thus activating them. However, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a protein involved in DNA repair and programmed cell death, was decreased. Cumulatively, these results suggest that the invasion of HCT-8 cells by C. parvum results in an ER stress response by the host cell that culminates in overexpression of host cell SSAT-1 and elevated N1-acetylpolyamines, which can be used by a parasite that lacks ornithine decarboxylase.Background: Invasion of host cells by Cryptosporidium parvum results in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response.Results: Host cell calreticulin, GRP78/BiP, Nrf2, and spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase increase, whereas poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase decreases.Conclusion: C. parvum causes an ER stress response culminating in the synthesis of N1-acetylspermine by infected cells.Significance: Host ER stress provides a source of polyamines for C. parvum, which lacks ornithine decarboxylase. Invasion of human intestinal epithelial cells (HCT-8) by Cryptosporidium parvum resulted in a rapid induction of host cell spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (hSSAT-1) mRNA, causing a 4-fold increase in SSAT-1 enzyme activity after 24 h of infection. In contrast, host cell SSAT-2, spermine oxidase, and acetylpolyamine oxidase (hAPAO) remained unchanged during this period. Intracellular polyamine levels of C. parvum-infected human epithelial cells were determined, and it was found that spermidine remained unchanged and putrescine increased by 2.5-fold after 15 h and then decreased after 24 h, whereas spermine decreased by 3.9-fold after 15 h. Concomitant with these changes, N1-acetylspermine and N1-acetylspermidine both increased by 115- and 24-fold, respectively. Increased SSAT-1 has previously been shown to be involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response leading to apoptosis.

Background: Invasion of host cells by Cryptosporidium parvum results in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. Results: Host cell calreticulin, GRP78/BiP, Nrf2, and spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase increase, whereas poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase decreases. Conclusion: C. parvum causes an ER stress response culminating in the synthesis of N1-acetylspermine by infected cells. Significance: Host ER stress provides a source of polyamines for C. parvum, which lacks ornithine decarboxylase. Cryptosporidium parvum belongs to a ubiquitous and diverse group of intracellular apicomplexan parasites of both human and veterinary importance. Ribosomal RNA data have shown that within the Apicomplexa, C. parvum forms an early branch point near the dinoflagellates and is more closely related to Plasmodium sp. than other Coccidia (1Cai J.

Based upon kinetic data, it is unlikely that the parasite arginine decarboxylase will provide sufficient polyamines for parasite growth and survival. Both C. parvum and T. gondii have an active retroconversion pathway that utilizes spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) and acetylpolyamine oxidase (APAO) to convert spermine to spermidine (4Yarlett N.

Although intracellular, C. parvum is extracytoplasmic, and a significant barrier composed of four membranes separates the parasite from the host cell cytoplasm. Polyamines are cationic compounds that require specific transport mechanisms for their uptake or removal from the cell (7Seiler N. Catabolism of polyamines.Amino Acids. 2004; 26: 217-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Polyamine acetylation is a mechanism for neutralizing the charge on the terminal amines, allowing movement of the molecule across cell membranes in the absence of energy transporters (8Seiler N. Bolkenius F.N. Rennert O.M. Interconversion, catabolism and elimination of the polyamines.Med. Biol. 1981; 59: 334-346PubMed Google Scholar, 9Seiler N. Functions of polyamine acetylation.Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1987; 65: 2024-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the effect of C. parvum upon polyamine synthesis and export by the intestinal epithelial cell line HCT-8. The results indicate that invasion of host cells by C. parvum results in an ER stress response that causes increased expression of human SSAT-1 (hSSAT-1), resulting in overproduction and excretion of N1-acetylspermine and N1-acetylspermidine, which can be taken up by the parasite. ornithine decarboxylase spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase acetylpolyamine oxidase human SSAT-1 minimal essential medium human spermine oxidase C. parvum SSAT N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid endoplasmic reticulum CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase unfolded protein response PRK-like ER-associated protein kinase. Oocysts were obtained from G. & S. Pritchard (Bunch Grass Farm, Deary, ID). Oocysts were passaged in 2–5-day-old calves, collected, and purified on CsCl gradients as described (10Kilani R.T. Sekla L.

Oocysts were then surface-sterilized using 10% (v/v) Clorox®, washed, and shipped in potassium dichromate. Oocysts were washed with distilled H2O to rinse them free of potassium dichromate and washed with 10% (v/v) Clorox before being suspended in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 10% horse serum. Human adenocarcinoma cells (HCT-8, ATCC CCL-244) were grown to confluence on 75-cm2 flasks in MEM containing 10% horse serum. One set was infected with 2 × 107 freshly excysted sporozoites, and a second set was maintained as uninfected controls. The medium was removed from the plates at 3-h intervals from 0 to 9 h, and a 24-h time was included. HCT-8 cells were collected by trypsin treatment and washed with fresh MEM, and the cell pellets were stored at −70 °C until assayed for polyamine-metabolizing enzymes and RT-PCR studies as described below. Polyamines were separated and identified by reverse-phase HPLC using a PerkinElmer LC 410 system coupled to a C18 10-μm column (4.5 × 250 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The method employed a 40-min discontinuous gradient starting with 90% (v/v) buffer A (0.1 m NaH2PO4, 8 mm octanesulfonic acid, and 0.05 mm EDTA) and 10% (v/v) buffer B (acetonitrile). The initial conditions were held for 5 min before changing to 20% buffer B for 15 min, 40% buffer B for a further 10 min, and then returning to 10% buffer B for 10 min. Samples and standards were mixed 1:1 with 1.5 mm o-phthalaldehyde (dissolved in 0.5 m boric acid, 0.43 m KOH, and 0.014 m β-mercaptoethanol) using a post-column pump and detected using a dual detection system employing a PerkinElmer fluorescence detector (excitation wavelength, 320 nm; and emission wavelength, 455 nm) and a β-RAM radiometric detector (IN/US Systems). Areas under the peaks were determined using β-RAM computer software (IN/US Systems). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan assay) with a PerkinElmer ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system was used to measure the expression of hSSAT-1, hSSAT-2, human spermine oxidase (hSMO), and hAPAO. The mRNA levels of the gene of interest and those of the internal standard (human actin) were measured concurrently from the same cDNA preparations. Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy spin columns. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase, followed by PCR using the ABI PRISM 7700 system. The detection and quantitation of PCR products with the ABI PRISM 7700 system were performed by fluorescence using gene-specific primers and a fluorogenic probe. The comparative CT method of quantitation was used as described previously (12Hector S. Porter C.W. Kramer D.L. Clark K. Prey J. Kisiel N. Diegelman P. Chen Y. Pendyala L.

Data shown are the -fold increase for treated samples relative to untreated controls. The primers and probes for hSSAT-1, hSSAT-2, and human actin were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) as ready-to-use kits (hSSAT-1, Assays-on-Demand, Assay Hs00161511_m1; hSSAT-2, Assays-on-Demand, Assay Hs00374138_g1; and human actin, predeveloped assay reagent, catalog no. 4310881E). The hSSAT-1 probe lies on the exon 3/exon 4 junction (accession no. NM_002970). The hSSAT-2 probe lies on the exon 2/exon 3 junction (accession no. AF348524). The primers and probes for hSMO and hAPAO were designed through Applied Biosystems under the Assay-by-Design option and are as follows: hSMO (accession no.

One unit activity is defined as 1 nmol of substrate consumed or product formed from the substrate in 1 min at 37 °C. SSAT activity was determined as described by Libby et al. (13Libby P.R. Ganis B. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Characterization of human spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase purified from cultured melanoma cells.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using 100 μm Bicine buffer (pH 8.0) containing 17 μm [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (60 μCi/mmol) and supplemented with 50 μm unlabeled acetyl-CoA, 500 μm spermine, and 25 μg of protein. The reaction was stopped after 30 min with ice-cold 50 mm hydroxylamine, placed in a boiling water bath for 3 min, cooled, and centrifuged at 9000 × g for 1 min to remove precipitated protein. The supernatant (50 μl) was spotted onto filter discs, dried, and washed with 6× 200-ml changes of distilled water to remove unreacted [1-14C]acetyl-CoA, with a final wash with 200 ml of methanol. The dried discs were placed in 10 ml of OmniFluor, and the radioactivity present as [14C]acetylspermine was counted using a Beckman Tri-Carb 1600CA liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blanks containing [14C]acetyl-CoA and protein without spermine or containing [14C]acetyl-CoA and spermine without protein were also analyzed and subtracted from the experimental results. APAO was determined spectrophotometrically at 420 nm by measuring the amount of peroxide formed in incubations containing 1 mm N1-acetylspermine, 10 mm glycine (pH 8.0), 5 units of HRP, 10 mm 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt, and 50 μg of sample protein in 1-ml cuvettes. ODC activity was measured by trapping the 14CO2 released from l-[1-14C]ornithine (42.5 μCi/mmol) using a reaction mixture containing 0.2 m acetate (pH 6.5), 60 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, and 3 mg/ml BSA in a final volume of 0.5 ml (14Jänne J. Williams-Ashman H.G. On the purification of l-ornithine decarboxylase from rat prostate and effects of thiol compounds on the enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1725-1732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was started by the addition of 10–30 μg of protein and incubated for 30 min in a shaking water bath at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml of 40% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and incubated for an additional 30 min. SMO was assayed by determining the H2O2 formed due to the oxidation of spermine by converting homovanillic acid into a highly fluorescent compound in the presence of HRP (15Wang Y. Devereux W. Woster P.M. Stewart T.M. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Cloning and characterization of a human polyamine oxidase that is inducible by polyamine analogue exposure.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5370-5373PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were prepared in a 1-ml reaction containing 8.3 mm sodium borate buffer (pH 9.0), 0.04 mg of HRP, 0.5–1.0 mg of homogenate protein, 0.1 mg of homovanillic acid, and 2.5 mm spermine. Before the addition of homovanillic acid and spermine, the tubes were preincubated for 20 min with shaking at 37 °C to remove endogenous substrates of H2O2-producing enzymes. After preincubation, homovanillic acid and spermine were added, and the reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The enzyme activity was stopped by the addition of 2.0 ml of 0.1 m NaOH solution. The fluorescence intensity was measured with excitation at 323 nm and emission at 426 nm. Background fluorescence was determined by the addition of spermine to the reaction mixture after inactivation of the enzyme by 5 m NaOH at 37 °C. HCT-8 cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates containing 5 ml of MEM supplemented with 10% horse serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Either 0.06 μmol of [U-14C]arginine (320 mCi/mmol) mixed with 1 mm l-arginine or 0.010 μmol of [14C]spermine (N,N′-bis(3-aminopropyl-]1,4-14C]tetramethylene-1,4-diamine; 104 mCi/mmol) mixed with 1 mm spermine was aseptically added to the wells and incubated for 2 h. The medium was aseptically removed, and the HCT-8 cells were washed three times with 5 ml of sterile 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm sodium chloride (PBS) to remove any extracellular labeled substrate. Finally, 5 ml of fresh MEM containing 10% horse serum was aseptically added to the HCT-8 cells along with 5 × 104 C. parvum oocysts and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After 24 h, the medium was removed, and C. parvum was separated by centrifugation at 3330 rpm for 10 min using an Eppendorf 5810R bench top centrifuge (Brinkmann Instruments). The spent medium and parasites were analyzed for polyamines by HPLC as described above. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (16Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. Protein measurement with the Folin phenol reagent.J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blots, proteins (50 μg) were separated by 10–14% gradient SDS-PAGE. Briefly, the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in a semidry blotting chamber (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol or in a transfer apparatus in 10 mm CAPS in 15% methanol (pH 10.6). Blots were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and probed with the following rabbit anti-human antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology at a concentration of 0.4 μg/ml: GRP78 (glucose response protein 78), calreticulin, Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2), and actin. In addition, rabbit anti-human anti-phospho-eIF2α from Cell Signaling Technology was used at a dilution of 1:1000. To assess the activity of ER stress-regulated apoptosis pathways, we examined the expression of CHOP. Anti-human CHOP was obtained from MBL International Corp. (Woburn, MA). Blots were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking and then incubated with HRP-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:10,000; Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were exposed using a chemiluminescence detection method (ECL detection system, Amersham Biosciences). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was assayed using a universal PARP colorimetric assay kit with histone-coated strip wells. Detection based on an ELISA employing mouse anti-PARP monoclonal antibody and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was performed as described by the manufacturer (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Etoposide (20 μg/ml) was used as a positive control. H2O2 was detected in C. parvum-infected and control cells using Fluoro H2O2,TM a fluorescent hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase detection kit (Cell Technology, Inc., Mountain View, CA), and measured on a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader at an excitation wavelength of 540 nm and an emission wavelength of 600 nm. Tetracycline (10 μg/ml) was used as a positive control. The activities of polyamine-metabolizing enzymes were determined in C. parvum-infected HCT-8 cells and compared with those in uninfected controls. The activity of SSAT-1 increased by 9.8-fold in C. parvum-infected HCT-8 cells from 12 nmol/min/mg of protein to a maximum of 117 nmol/min/mg of protein after 9 h (Table 1). By comparison, the activity of ODC increased by 10.5-fold after 24 h, but APAO showed no significant change compared with uninfected controls (Table 1).TABLE 1Activity of polyamine-metabolizing enzymes in control and C. parvum-infected HCT-8 cells with increasing time of infectionHCT-8 cellsEnzymeControl9-h infected15-h infected24-h infectednmol/min/mg proteinSSAT-112.1 ± 2.3117.2 ± 18.368.8 ± 9.858.5 ± 10.1APAO0.15 ± 0.060.20 ± 0.070.19 ± 0.080.21 ± 0.14ODC0.02 ± 0.010.05 ± 0.010.19 ± 0.090.21 ± 0.13 Open table in a new tab The concentration of polyamines was determined during the course of a C. parvum infection of HCT-8 cells. HPLC analysis of control and C. parvum-infected HCT-8 cultures revealed that putrescine increased by 2.6-fold by 15 h, whereas spermidine and spermine decreased by 4-fold by 9 and 15 h, respectively, returning to control levels by 24 h. In concert with the increased putrescine, the 15-h time point showed 115- and 24-fold increases in N1-acetylspermine and N1-acetylspermidine, respectively (Fig. 1). The hSSAT-1 and hAPAO mRNA probes used are specific for mammalian enzymes and do not recognize these proteins in C. parvum. As shown in previous molecular studies of C. parvum, CpSSAT has greater similarity to the prokaryotic GNAT (general N-acetyltransferase) enzymes (4Yarlett N. Wu G. Waters W.R. Harp J.A. Wannemuehler M.J. Morada M. Athanasopoulos D. Martinez M.P. Upton S.J. Marton L.J. Frydman B.J. Cryptosporidium parvum spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase exhibits different characteristics from the host enzyme.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2007; 152: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The ability of the hSSAT-1 primers to recognize the parasite enzyme and vice versa was tested, and we found no cross-reactivity, confirming the primer specificity (Table 2).TABLE 2RT-PCR analysis of hSSAT-1 and CpSSAT in HCT-8 cells infected with C. parvum by use of specific primers designed for the human and parasite enzymeshSSAT/β-actin (×10−3)CpSSAT/β-actin (×10−3)HCT-8 cells513.5 ± 30.5NDC. parvum-infected HCT-8 cells744.0 ± 11.90.62 ± 0.1C. parvumND94.2 ± 6.1 Open table in a new tab Based upon biochemical analysis, SSAT-2 and SMO were not detectable in C. parvum (limits of detection of 1 pmol/min; data not shown), and no sequence similarity was obtained by BLAST search of the C. parvum genome database using the human, mouse, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae sequence. Consistent with the results of enzyme analysis, we found that only the mRNA levels of hSSAT-1 were increased (2.6-fold) in HCT-8 cells infected with C. parvum compared with uninfected controls (Table 3). The mRNA levels of hSSAT-2, hAPAO, and hSMO were unchanged compared with control cells (Table 3). The increase in hSSAT-1 mRNA levels in C. parvum-infected HCT-8 cells was found to coincide with increased time of exposure to the parasites (Table 4). Collectively, these results indicate that C. parvum infection of HCT-8 cells results in a dramatic increase in host cell hSSAT-1, a key enzyme in polyamine retroconversion. As hAPAO and other host cell enzymes do not appear to increase, the net result is an increase in acetylated polyamines. It is well documented that acetylation of polyamines targets them for excretion; we therefore propose that acetylated polyamines pass through the host cell membrane and are available for the developing parasite, which is positioned in an extracytoplasmic vacuole. The acetylated polyamine is then further retroconverted to spermidine and putrescine by parasite enzymes (Fig. 2).TABLE 3mRNA levels of uninfected and C. parvum-infected HCT-8 cellsPrimer1/2ΔCT (×10−3)-Fold changeControl HCT-8 cellshSSAT-181.6 + 17hSSAT-211.5 ± 2.3hSMO14.5 ± 1.2hAPAO0.601 ± 0.010C. parvum-infected HCT-8 cellshSSAT-1312 ± 413.8hSSAT-214.1 ± 0.891.2hSMO14.6 ± 0.571.0hAPAO0.432 ± 0.0310.7 Open table in a new tab TABLE 4HCT-8 mRNA levels for hSSAT-1 with increased time of C. parvum infectionSample1/2ΔCT (×10−3)-Fold changeControl hSSAT-181.6 ± 17Infected hSSAT-1 (3 h)254 ± 363.1Infected hSSAT-1 (6 h)312 ± 413.8Infected hSSAT-1 (9 h)379 ± 344.6Infected hSSAT-1 (24 h)476 ± 495.8 Open table in a new tab To demonstrate directly that C. parvum took up host-derived polyamines, HCT-8 cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates incubated with 14C-radiolabeled arginine or spermine. Tracer studies demonstrated that significant [U-14C]arginine and [14C]spermine were taken up in 2 h and that [U-14C]arginine was converted to [14C]spermine (Table 5). Exogenous 14C-labeled precursor amines were removed, and HCT-8 cells were infected with 104 C. parvum oocysts. During the 24-h incubation phase, the parasite completed its infection cycle, and the progeny were separated from the medium and analyzed for 14C-radiolabeled spermine, which originated from the HCT-8 cells (Table 5). The results indicate that C. parvum recovered from [U-14C]arginine-incubated HCT-8 cells contained [14C]spermine as the sole radiolabeled product. The percentage of [14C]spermine in the parasite compared with that released into the medium was 25–33% in three separate experiments (Table 5). C. parvum recovered from [14C]spermine-incubated HCT-8 cells contained [14C]spermine as the sole radiolabeled product. The percentage of [14C]spermine recovered in the parasite compared with that in the medium was 17–36%. These results confirm that C. parvum is capable of obtaining significant amounts of spermine from the host.TABLE 5Recovery of host cell spermine in C. parvum from infected HCT-8 cellsSubstrate/fractionSpermine recoveredRecovery in C. parvummm%[U-14C]Arginine0.0300.013 ± 0.004250.0100.005 ± 0.001330.0080.003 ± 0.000427[14C]Spermine0.120.025 ± 0.006140.030.014 ± 0.003250.010.006 ± 0.000337 Open table in a new tab The involvement of N1-acetylspermine in the ER stress response of HCT-8 cells was examined by Western blot analysis of rabbit anti-human antibodies to known ER stress proteins. Protein expression of calreticulin, GRP78, Nrf2, and phospho-eIF2α was increased in cell lysates from HCT-8 cells after a 9-h infection with C. parvum compared with that in lysates prepared from control HCT-8 cells (Fig. 3). The means ± S.E. (n = 3 in each group) of results of bands obtained from triplicate analysis of GRP78 and phospho-eIF2α assessed by densitometry quantitate up-regulation of these proteins in infected cells compared with uninfected controls (Fig. 4). CHOP was also increased in lysates from HCT-8 cells after a 9-h infection with C. parvum (Fig. 5). PARP, a protein involved in a number of cellular processes involving mainly DNA repair, was found to decrease in lysates of infected HCT-8 cells using mouse anti-human PARP monoclonal antibody and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in an ELISA/sandwich enzyme immunoassay (Fig. 6). It has previously been shown that a short exposure (15 min) of HeLa cells to H2O2 (15–50 μm) activates an unfolded protein response (UPR), resulting in increased expression of PRK-like ER-associated protein kinase (PERK), eIF2α, and IRE1α (inositol-requiring enzyme-1α) and ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) cleavage, and that a longer exposure (1–3 h) to H2O2 induces ER-mediated apoptosis (47Pallepati P.

https://openalex.org/W2018445860,"Formation of plaque by fibrils of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide in the brain is the characteristic feature of Alzheimer disease (AD). Inhibition of the process of aggregate formation from Aβ-monomer and destabilization of the aggregate could be useful for prevention and propagation of the disease respectively. Russell's viper venom (RVV) contains protein(s) that destabilize Aβ aggregates as revealed from the thioflavin T assay. The active component was identified as factor V activator (RVV-V). Among the possible mechanisms of destabilization, RVV-V-mediated proteolysis was ruled out from mass spectrometric data and the thioflavin T assay. The alternate hypothesis that small peptides derived from RVV-V destabilize the aggregate is better supported by experimental results. Six small peptides were synthesized using RVV-V as the template, and three unrelated peptides were synthesized to serve as controls. Destabilization of Aβ aggregate by these peptides was studied using spectrofluorometric assays, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and confocal microscopy. Among the peptides, CTNIF and the mixture of the six peptides were most potent in converting the aggregates to the monomeric state and thus, preventing cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. The control peptides failed to show similar effects. Moreover, some of these peptides are stable in blood for 24 h. Therefore, these venom-derived peptides offer an encouraging opportunity to prevent amyloidosis and may provide information to combat AD."

Background: Prions are aberrantly folded infectious proteins whose biological activity is determined by their distinct folds. Results: The infectious fold of the fungal prion-forming domain HET-s(218–289) can be nucleated by a noninfectious polymorph. Conclusion: Generic amyloid architectures can seed the formation of infectious prions. Significance: Heterogeneous seeding may be a mechanism of prion strain adaptation and interspecies transmission. Prions are proteinaceous infectious particles: proteins that take on a specific, self-propagating, aberrant fold (1.Prusiner S.B. Fields Virology. 5th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 3059-3091Google Scholar). The term prion was originally coined to describe the protein-only infectious agent found in scrapie, a neurodegenerative disease of sheep. Prions have since been implicated in related diseases in bovines, cervids, and humans, diseases collectively known as the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The infectious agents are made up of aggregates of the aberrantly folded mammalian prion protein, PrP. 2The abbreviations used are: PrP, prion protein; recPrP, recombinant PrP; PrPSc, PrP scrapie; ssNMR, solid state NMR. In the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, the prions form unbranched fibrillar assemblies known as amyloids (2.Prusiner S.B. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Bolton D.C. Bendheim P.E. Groth D.F. Glenner G.G. Scrapie prions aggregate to form amyloid-like birefringent rods.Cell. 1983; 35: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), which are typically poorly ordered. Amyloids have a common cross-β architecture consisting of β-strands that extend roughly perpendicular to the fiber axis, forming sheets that run parallel to the fiber axis (3.Eanes E.D. Glenner G.G. X-ray diffraction studies on amyloid filaments.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1968; 16: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 4.Astbury W.T. Dickinson S. Bailey K. The X-ray interpretation of denaturation and the structure of the seed globulins.Biochem. J. 1935; 29: 2351-2360.1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulated amyloids are associated with a number of diseases in addition to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and type II diabetes (5.Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Protein misfolding, functional amyloid, and human disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar). Although these amyloid diseases do not appear to be communicable between individuals, there is increasing evidence that the associated aberrantly folded proteins share self-propagating infectious properties similar to those of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy-associated prions (6.Prusiner S.B. A unifying role for prions in neurodegenerative diseases.Science. 2012; 336: 1511-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 7.Holmes B.B. Diamond M.I. Cellular mechanisms of protein aggregate propagation.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2012; 25: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition to disease-related proteins and peptides, functional prions and amyloids have been identified in a number of different organisms. Examples include curli fibers in Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae (8.Barnhart M.M. Chapman M.R. Curli biogenesis and function.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), Pmel17 associated with melanosome maturation in humans (9.McGlinchey R.P. Shewmaker F. McPhie P. Monterroso B. Thurber K. Wickner R.B. The repeat domain of the melanosome fibril protein Pmel17 forms the amyloid core promoting melanin synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and a number of peptide hormones stored in secretory granules (10.Maji S.K. Perrin M.H. Sawaya M.R. Jessberger S. Vadodaria K. Rissman R.A. Singru P.S. Nilsson K.P.R. Simon R. Schubert D. Eisenberg D. Rivier J. Sawchenko P. Vale W. Riek R. Functional amyloids as natural storage of peptide hormones in pituitary secretory granules.Science. 2009; 325: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), although these amyloids do not appear to have the in vivo self-propagating activity of prions. Functional amyloids in yeast and fungi, however, have been shown to be prions by their propagation of phenotype through inheritance, by contact with prion-infected individuals, and by inoculation of prion fibrils prepared in vitro (11.Wickner R.B. Taylor K.L. Edskes H.K. Maddelein M.L. Moriyama H. Roberts B.T. Prions in Saccharomyces and Podospora spp.: protein-based inheritance.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 844-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among these functional prions are the glutamine/asparagine-rich prions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, including Sup35p and Ure3p, and HET-s from the fungus Podospora anserina. The prion-forming domain of HET-s, residues 218–289, is distinct from the Saccharomyces prion-forming domains because it has no particular amino acid composition bias, so insights from HET-s into interactions between sequence, structure, and infectivity are more likely to be applicable to pathogenic prions and amyloids. HET-s(218–289) can be fibrillized into prions or noninfectious amyloids by controlling the pH of the fibrillization buffer (12.Sabaté R. Baxa U. Benkemoun L. Sánchez de Groot N. Coulary-Salin B. Maddelein M.L. Malato L. Ventura S. Steven A.C. Saupe S.J. Prion and non-prion amyloids of the HET-s prion forming domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 768-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). At physiological pH, HET-s(218–289) forms infectious fibrils that exhibit a high degree of order and homogeneity. These features make infectious HET-s(218–289) amenable to solid state NMR (ssNMR) analysis, which resulted in an atomic resolution structure: a repeating two-rung β-solenoid (13.Van Melckebeke H. Wasmer C. Lange A. Ab E. Loquet A. Böckmann A. Meier B.H. Atomic-resolution three-dimensional structure of HET-s(218–289) amyloid fibrils by solid-state NMR spectroscopy.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 13765-13775Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). At low pH, HET-s(218–289) forms noninfectious amyloids that have heterogeneous morphologies and properties (12.Sabaté R. Baxa U. Benkemoun L. Sánchez de Groot N. Coulary-Salin B. Maddelein M.L. Malato L. Ventura S. Steven A.C. Saupe S.J. Prion and non-prion amyloids of the HET-s prion forming domain.J. Mol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 5545-5550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). ssNMR studies of low pH fibrils indicated that they have structures significantly different from those of the physiological pH fibrils (15.Wasmer C. Soragni A. Sabaté R. Lange A. Riek R. Meier B.H. Infectious and noninfectious amyloids of the HET-s(218–289) prion have different NMR spectra.Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2008; 47: 5839-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Low resolution models of one- and three-protofilament fibrils have been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy, although these studies have suggested structures similar to the β-solenoid (16.Mizuno N. Baxa U. Steven A.C. Structural dependence of HET-s amyloid fibril infectivity assessed by cryoelectron microscopy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 3252-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we and others showed that particular low pH conditions can cause HET-s(218–289) to degrade, with the resulting peptides forming stacked β-sheet structures similar to those commonly found in short amyloidogenic peptides (17.Wan W. Wille H. Stöhr J. Baxa U. Prusiner S.B. Stubbs G. Degradation of fungal prion HET-s(218–289) induces formation of a generic amyloid fold.Biophys. J. 2012; 102: 2339-2344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18.Sawaya M.R. Sambashivan S. Nelson R. Ivanova M.I. Sievers S.A. Apostol M.I. Thompson M.J. Balbirnie M. Wiltzius J.J.W. McFarlane H.T. Madsen A.Ø. Riekel C. Eisenberg D. Atomic structures of amyloid cross-β spines reveal varied steric zippers.Nature. 2007; 447: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). In this study, we show by x-ray fiber diffraction that HET-s(218–289) polymorphism consists of two different architectures: two-rung β-solenoids and single-layered stacked β-sheets. Under the conditions of this study, stacked β-sheet HET-s(218–289) fibrils are preferentially formed at low pH, although formation of β-solenoids is possible with the addition of seed fibrils. Seeding with stacked β-sheets in otherwise β-solenoid-forming conditions did not result in the formation of stacked β-sheet fibrils, but did alter fibrillization kinetics. Differences in seeding behavior and infectivity between low and high pH fibrils has been previously shown (12.Sabaté R. Baxa U. Benkemoun L. Sánchez de Groot N. Coulary-Salin B. Maddelein M.L. Malato L. Ventura S. Steven A.C. Saupe S.J. Prion and non-prion amyloids of the HET-s prion forming domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 768-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but structural information on those fibrils was limited to morphological features shown by low resolution negative-stain electron microscopy (EM). Our use of fiber diffraction allows for direct probing of internal architecture and subunit structure (19.Rhodes G. Crystallography Made Crystal Clear. Third Ed. Elsevier/Academic Press, Burlington, MA2006: 211-219Crossref Google Scholar), which is not necessarily related to ultrastructural morphology (20.Ostapchenko V.G. Sawaya M.R. Makarava N. Savtchenko R. Nilsson K.P.R. Eisenberg D. Baskakov I.V. Two amyloid states of the prion protein display significantly different folding patterns.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 400: 908-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We propose that the distinct fibrillization kinetics from stacked β-sheet-seeded solutions are a result of heterogeneous seeding: the fibrillization of amyloid nucleated by a different amyloid structure. Similar effects have been seen with inoculation of recombinantly formed PrP amyloids into animals (21.Legname G. Baskakov I.V. Nguyen H.-O.B. Riesner D. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Synthetic mammalian prions.Science. 2004; 305: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar), leading to suggestions that heterogeneous seeding is the mechanism underlying prion strain adaptation and infection across species (22.Makarava N. Kovacs G.G. Savtchenko R. Alexeeva I. Budka H. Rohwer R.G. Baskakov I.V.

Neurosci. 2012; 32: 7345-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Taken together, our fiber diffraction and kinetics results demonstrate that interactions between polymorphic amyloids can occur despite distinct differences in structural architecture. HET-s(218–289) was expressed into inclusion bodies as a C-terminally His6-tagged construct in BL-21 E. coli cells and purified under denaturing conditions as described previously (17.Wan W. Wille H. Stöhr J. Baxa U. Prusiner S.B. Stubbs G. Degradation of fungal prion HET-s(218–289) induces formation of a generic amyloid fold.Biophys. J. 2012; 102: 2339-2344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Purified protein was moved into nondenaturing fibrillization buffers using freshly prepared Sephadex G-25 Superfine (GE Healthcare). To prevent cross-seeding under nondenaturing conditions, Sephadex media were used only once. pH 2.0 fibrillization buffers were citric acid or phosphoric acid at final concentrations of 50 mm, adjusted with HCl or NaOH. For pH 7.5 fibrils, HET-s(218–289) was purified into 150 mm acetic acid, pH 2.5, and titrated to pH 7.5 by the addition of 3 m Tris. For seeding experiments, pH 2.0 samples were prepared as above, and pH 4.0 samples were prepared by purification into 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. The 13C, 15N isotopically labeled HET-s(218–289) was expressed as described previously (24.Balguerie A. Dos Reis S. Ritter C. Chaignepain S. Coulary-Salin B. Forge V. Bathany K. Lascu I. Schmitter J.-M. Riek R. Saupe S.J. Domain organization and structure-function relationship of the HET-s prion protein of Podospora anserina.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2071-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and purified under denaturing conditions from inclusion bodies (17.Wan W. Wille H. Stöhr J. Baxa U. Prusiner S.B. Stubbs G. Degradation of fungal prion HET-s(218–289) induces formation of a generic amyloid fold.Biophys. J. 2012; 102: 2339-2344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Purified protein was concentrated and washed several times with 150 mm acetic acid, pH 2.5, using Centricon centrifugal devices with a 3-kDa cut-off (Millipore). For infectious fibril formation, the pH was adjusted to 7 with 3 m Tris-HCl, pH 7. Fiber diffraction specimens were prepared by hanging 12 μl of ∼20 mg/ml fibril solutions between sanded, silanized glass capillaries and allowing them to dry at nominal 100% relative humidity. High humidity of specimens was maintained at all times (25.McDonald M. Kendall A. Tanaka M. Weissman J.S. Stubbs G. Enclosed chambers for humidity control and sample containment in fiber diffraction.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2008; 41: 206-209Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fibril solutions were prepared by three cycles of ultracentrifugation and resuspension in final buffers. pH 2.0 specimens were resuspended in 5 mm concentrations of their buffers. All other specimens were resuspended in 5 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. Fiber diffraction data were collected at the Biological Small-Angle X-ray Scattering beamline 4-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource or the BioCAT beamline at the Advanced Photon Source. Processing of fiber diffraction patterns was performed with WCEN (26.Bian W. Wang H. McCullough I. Stubbs G. WCEN: a computer program for initial processing of fiber diffraction patterns.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 752-756Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For plots, diffraction patterns were first mapped to reciprocal space (27.Fraser R.D.B. Macrae T.P. Miller A. Rowlands R.J. Digital processing of fibre diffraction patterns.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1976; 9: 81-94Crossref Google Scholar) and circular symmetrically background-subtracted. Meridians and equators were integrated as 30° sector plots. Scale factors for each pair of plots were determined by least squares fitting of the equators from 0.03 to 0.25 Å−1. Data lower than ∼33 Å (d* < 0.03 Å−1) resolution were not plotted because of beam divergence and x-ray scatter around the beamstop. Patterns were compared by calculating correlation coefficients; these coefficients have been shown to be a reliable measure of structural similarity (28.Gonzalez A. Nave C. Marvin D.A. Pf1 filamentous bacteriophage: refinement of a molecular model by simulated annealing using 3.3 Å resolution X-ray fibre diffraction data.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1995; 51: 792-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For solenoidal patterns from different samples, made in the same way but at different times and measured at different synchrotrons, correlation coefficients were between 0.98 and 1.00. 13C-13C solid state NMR correlation spectrum (proton-driven spin diffusion, with a 50-ms mixing time) of uniformly 13C, 15N-labeled HET-s(218–289) was recorded at 700-MHz 1H frequency. The contours were cut at the 5 σ noise level. The black crosshairs were placed at the previously reported chemical shift assignments for the amino acids indicated (29.Siemer A.B. Ritter C. Steinmetz M.O. Ernst M. Riek R. Meier B.H. 13C, 15N resonance assignment of parts of the HET-s prion protein in its amyloid form.J. Biomol. NMR. 2006; 34: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The overlap between the previously published chemical shifts and those observed in our experiments (within 0.2 ppm) is indicative of the same structure for the core of the HET-s fibrils studied here and those with their structure previously solved by ssNMR. The stacked β-sheet model was constructed by manipulating the β-solenoid ssNMR structure, Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 2KJ3 (13.Van Melckebeke H. Wasmer C. Lange A. Ab E. Loquet A. Böckmann A. Meier B.H. Atomic-resolution three-dimensional structure of HET-s(218–289) amyloid fibrils by solid-state NMR spectroscopy.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 13765-13775Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), in Swiss-Pdb Viewer (30.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. SWISS-MODEL and the Swiss-PdbViewer: an environment for comparative protein modeling.Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9556) Google Scholar). Calculated diffraction patterns were produced using DISORDER, a program that calculates Fourier-Bessel transforms (31.Klug A. Crick F.H.C. Wyckoff H.W. Diffraction by helical structures.Acta Crystallogr. 1958; 11: 199-213Crossref Google Scholar) and simulates disorientation (32.Holmes K.C. Barrington Leigh J. The effect of disorientation on the intensity distribution of non-crystalline fibres. I. Theory.Acta Crystallogr. A. 1974; 30: 635-638Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). DISORDER and its associated documentation are available for download from the FiberNet website. B-factors of 4000 Å2 were used for disordered regions (residues 217–225, 247–259, 282–295) to simulate significant disorder. Remaining structured residues used B-factors of 10 Å2 to simulate high order. Residue numbers include the starting Met and C-terminal His6 tag in the construct. Plots for calculated diffraction were made as described above except that reciprocal space mapping and background subtraction were not required. For fibrillization kinetics, assays were carried out using a modified version of an assay described elsewhere (33.Wasmer C. Zimmer A. Sabaté R. Soragni A. Saupe S.J. Ritter C. Meier B.H. Structural similarity between the prion domain of HET-s and a homologue can explain amyloid cross-seeding in spite of limited sequence identity.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 402: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), performed in triplicate. HET-s(218–289) monomers were purified into 500 mm acetic acid and fractionated into 60-nmol aliquots as determined by absorbance at 280 nm (A280). Aliquots were immediately lyophilized, and the resultant powder was dissolved in 200 μl of hexafluoroisopropanol, lyophilized again, and stored at −20 °C. For assays, powder was resuspended in 1.5 ml of 175 mm acetic acid. Assays were started by the 1:1 addition of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and mixing by inversion, providing a final protein concentration of 20 μm. For seeded assays, 6 nmol (for a final concentration of 2 μm, a 1:10 molar ratio) of seed fibrils were moved into the Tris-HCl buffer by ultracentrifugation and resuspension and probe-sonicated for 30 s with ∼90 watts of power immediately prior to use. Stacked β-sheet fibrils were first washed with 50 mm citric acid, pH 2.0, purified three times by centrifugation, and resuspended to remove any monomers or small aggregates without inadvertently forming β-solenoids. Serially seeded assays were performed by treating fibrils from previous passages as described above. Seeds from triplicates were serially passaged individually. To prevent cross-contamination, assays were performed with disposable cuvettes. Unseeded and stacked β-sheet-seeded first passage assays were monitored using optical density at 400 nm (A400) measured every 10 min for 240 min. Assays seeded with β-solenoid or serially passaged stacked β-sheet-seeded solutions were measured at 1-min intervals for 20 min followed by measurements every 10 min up to 120 min. Assays to assess early stacked β-sheet seeding kinetics were measured at 1-min intervals for 20 min followed by 10-min intervals until 240 min was reached. Prior to each measurement, cuvettes were mixed by inverting several times. For display, data were fit to a Boltzmann function in Equation 1. y=A1−A21+e(x−x0)/dx+A2(Eq. 1) A1 is the low limit, A2 is the high limit, x0 is the half-amplitude point, and dx is the width. Error bars represent the S.D. between triplicates. Recombinantly expressed HET-s(218–289) was fibrillized at pH 7.5 as described previously (34.Wasmer C. Lange A. Van Melckebeke H. Siemer A.B. Riek R. Meier B.H. Amyloid Fibrils of the HET-s(218–289) prion form a β-solenoid with a triangular hydrophobic core.Science. 2008; 319: 1523-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) or at pH 2.0 in either 50 mm citric acid buffer or 50 mm phosphoric acid buffer. X-ray fiber diffraction patterns were obtained from each of these fibril types (Fig. 1). Diffraction patterns were of two distinct types. The meridional diffraction from pH 7.5 HET-s(218–289) (Fig. 1A) includes the definitive cross-β reflection at ∼4.7 Å and a second reflection at 9.4 Å, demonstrating that the repeating unit of these fibrils is two β-strands thick. Meridional diffraction from pH 2.0 fibrils (Fig. 1, B and C) contains only the cross-β reflection, indicating that the repeating unit of these fibrils is only one β-strand thick. The equatorial diffraction from pH 7.5 fibrils consists of a series of strong intensity maxima, indicating a roughly cylindrical cross-sectional structure (35.Wille H. Bian W. McDonald M. Kendall A.

The radial density distribution in some strains of tobacco mosaic virus.Virology. 1958; 6: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Equatorial diffraction from both types of pH 2.0 sample is dominated by an intensity maximum at ∼10 Å, which is generally interpreted as representing the spacing between β-sheets stacked perpendicular to the fiber axis (17.Wan W. Wille H. Stöhr J. Baxa U. Prusiner S.B. Stubbs G. Degradation of fungal prion HET-s(218–289) induces formation of a generic amyloid fold.Biophys.

The common architecture of cross-β amyloid.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 395: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The pH 7.5 diffraction patterns are in good qualitative agreement with the two-rung β-solenoid ssNMR structure, and we have used ssNMR to verify that our pH 7.5 HET-s(218–289) sample indeed has the same chemical shift assignments as those published (13.Van Melckebeke H. Wasmer C. Lange A. Ab E. Loquet A. Böckmann A. Meier B.H. Atomic-resolution three-dimensional structure of HET-s(218–289) amyloid fibrils by solid-state NMR spectroscopy.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 13765-13775Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). For quantitative comparisons between diffraction patterns, meridional and equatorial intensities were obtained by integrating along 30° arcs. Meridional diffraction data (Fig. 1D) from the pH 2.0 samples clearly show only the ∼4.7 Å (d* = 0.21 Å−1) cross-β reflection, whereas the pH 7.5 pattern also includes diffraction maxima from a meridional ∼9.4 Å (d* = 0.11 Å−1) reflection and an off-meridional intensity from the same layer line, indicating the presence of a two-rung helical structure. Equatorial data represent the cylindrically averaged Fourier transforms of the fibril electron density; the data are continuous along the equator, showing that the samples are non-crystalline. Equatorial data from the different pH 2.0 samples (Fig. 1E) show roughly the same intensity distributions, although the precise locations and widths of maxima vary, indicating slight differences in the structures. Quantitative equatorial comparisons were made by calculating correlation coefficients between each pair of plots. Correlation between the pH 2.0 equators (correlation coefficient = 0.91) is high (28.Gonzalez A. Nave C. Marvin D.A. Pf1 filamentous bacteriophage: refinement of a molecular model by simulated annealing using 3.3 Å resolution X-ray fibre diffraction data.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1995; 51: 792-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and together with the meridional data, indicates that these specimens share the same overall architecture, although the disorientation and low resolution of the data preclude comparisons of atomic structures. Correlation between pH 7.5 and pH 2.0 citric acid or phosphoric acid equatorial plots is low (0.68 and 0.48, respectively), and taken together with the presence or absence of 9.4 Å meridional reflections, clearly demonstrates that the fibrils formed at different pH values have distinct architectures. Diffraction patterns from stacked β-sheet amyloids have historically been interpreted with the aid of data from mechanical manipulation of specimens, as in the case of super-contracted epidermin (38.Rudall, K. M., (1946) in The Society of Dyers and Colourists: Symposium on Fibrous Proteins, pp. 15–23, Chorley and Pickersgill, Leeds, United Kingdom.Google Scholar), or with the help of constraints provided by crystallinity and simple repeating amino acid sequences, as in the case of the lacewing fly egg stalk (39.Geddes A.J. Parker K.D. Atkins E.D. Beighton E. “Cross-β” conformation in proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 32: 343-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These approaches are not available for HET-s, but we can identify architectural features by comparing experimental data with data calculated from models of stacked β-sheets: an approach we have used qualitatively in previous work (35.Wille H. Bian W. McDonald M. Kendall A. Colby D.W. Bloch L. Ollesch J. Borovinskiy A.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Stubbs G. Natural and synthetic prion structure from X-ray fiber diffraction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16990-16995Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To provide a quantitative comparison with the analysis described here, we constructed a stacked β-sheet model of HET-s(218–289), retaining the β- and random-coil regions from the β-solenoid, but rearranging them to form a stacked β-sheet structure (Fig. 3A). Apart from avoiding close atomic contacts, no other constraints were used. The model is not meant to represent"
https://openalex.org/W2052057312,"Unproductive ribosome stalling in eubacteria is resolved by the actions of SmpB protein and transfer messenger (tm) RNA. We examined the functional significance of conserved regions of SmpB and tmRNA to the trans-translation process. Our investigations reveal that the N-terminal 20 residues of SmpB, which are located near the ribosomal decoding center, are dispensable for all known SmpB activities. In contrast, a set of conserved residues that reside at the junction between the tmRNA-binding core and the C-terminal tail of SmpB play an important role in tmRNA accommodation. Our data suggest that the highly conserved glycine 132 acts as a flexible hinge that enables movement of the C-terminal tail, thus permitting proper positioning and establishment of the tmRNA open reading frame (ORF) as the surrogate template. To gain further insights into the function of the SmpB C-terminal tail, we examined the tagging activity of hybrid variants of tmRNA and the SmpB protein, in which the tmRNA ORF or the SmpB C-terminal tail was substituted with the equivalent but highly divergent sequences from Francisella tularensis. We observed that the hybrid tmRNA was active but resulted in less accurate selection of the resume codon. Cognate hybrid SmpB was necessary to restore activity. Furthermore, accurate tagging was observed when the identity of the resume codon was reverted from GGC to GCA. Taken together, these data suggest that the engagement of the tmRNA ORF and the selection of the correct translation resumption point are distinct activities that are influenced by independent tmRNA and SmpB determinants."

We previously reported that a fine rheostatic balance between the anti- and pro-apoptotic multidomain Bcl-2 family proteins controls hepatocyte apoptosis in the healthy liver.

Significance: We demonstrated the novel involvement of BH3-only proteins in the healthy Bcl-2 network of the liver. Apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway, which is known as the mitochondrial pathway, is regulated by Bcl-2 family members. These members are divided into two groups as follows: core Bcl-2 family proteins, which possess three or four Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1–BH4) 2The abbreviations used are: BH1–BH4Bcl-2 homology domains 1–4SCIDsevere combined immune deficiencyALTalanine aminotransferase. and the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins (1Youle R.J. Strasser A. The BCL-2 protein family. Opposing activities that mediate cell death.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3536) Google Scholar). The former, which are multidomain proteins, are subdivided into pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. Pro-apoptotic core Bcl-2 family members, such as Bax and Bak, serve as effector molecules of this apoptotic machinery. Upon activation, these members can form pores to permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane. Apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c, can then be released through this membrane into the cytosol, leading to the activation of the caspase cascade and to cellular demise (2Chipuk J.E. Green D.R. How do BCL-2 proteins induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization?.Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 157-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Anti-apoptotic core Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Bcl-w, and Bfl-1/A1, inhibit the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by either directly or indirectly antagonizing Bak/Bax activity (3Adams J.M.

We found that the disruption of Bim ameliorated hepatocyte apoptosis in Bcl-xL- or Mcl-1-knock-out mice, indicating the involvement of Bim in this hepatocyte apoptosis machinery in the healthy liver as well as that of Bid. Additionally, the deletion of both Bim and Bid prevented the massive hepatocyte apoptosis caused by the inhibition of both Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, suggesting that Bim and Bid are functionally active in the healthy liver and are essential regulators for promoting the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in hepatocytes in the absence of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Our present study unveiled the fine and dynamic Bcl-2 networks, the orchestration of which determines hepatocyte life and death in the healthy liver.

The mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free facility and were afforded humane care under approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee of Osaka University Medical School. Liver sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). To detect apoptotic cells, the liver sections were also subjected to staining by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) according to a procedure reported previously (20Kodama T.

Liver tissue was lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1× protein inhibitor mixture (Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan), 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Nacalai tesque), and phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4). The liver lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). The protein lysates were electrophoretically separated with SDS-polyacrylamide gels and were transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. For immunodetection, the following antibodies were used: a rabbit polyclonal antibody to Bcl-xL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), a rabbit polyclonal antibody to Bid, a rabbit polyclonal antibody to Bax, a rabbit polyclonal antibody to cleaved caspase-3, a rabbit polyclonal antibody to cleaved caspase-7, a rabbit polyclonal antibody to Puma (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), a rabbit monoclonal antibody to Bad, a rabbit polyclonal antibody to Noxa (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), a rabbit polyclonal antibody to Bak (Millipore, Billerica, MA), a rabbit polyclonal antibody to Bim (Enzo Life Sciences Inc., Farmingdale, NY), a rabbit polyclonal antibody to Mcl-1 (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA), and a mouse monoclonal antibody to β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).

The mice were sacrificed and examined as indicated by the time courses. The Stealth RNAi negative control with low GC content (Invitrogen) was used as the control. ABT-737 was dissolved in a mixture of 30% propylene glycol, 5% Tween 80, and 65% D5W (5% dextrose in water) with pH 4–5. ABT-737 (100 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered to the Bim/Bid double knock-out mice (bim−/−bid−/−) or to the Bid-knock-out mice (bid−/−). The mice were sacrificed and examined 6 h later. All of the data are expressed as means ± S.D. unless otherwise indicated. Statistical analyses were performed using an unpaired Student's t test or a one-way analysis of variance unless otherwise indicated. When the analyses of variance were applied, the differences in the mean values among the groups were examined by Scheffe's post hoc correction unless otherwise indicated. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To investigate the involvement of the BH3-only protein Bim in the hepatocyte apoptosis caused by Bcl-xL deficiency, hepatocyte-specific Bcl-xL-knock-out mice (bcl-xfl/flalb-cre) were mated with systemic Bim-knock-out mice (bim−/−). Offspring from the mating of bim+/−bcl-xfl/flalb-cre mice and bim+/−bcl-xfl/fl mice were examined at 6 weeks of age. A Western blot study confirmed the disappearance of both Bcl-xL and Bim protein expression in the liver tissue of the double knock-out mice (bim−/−bcl-xfl/flalb-cre) (Fig. 1A). In agreement with our previous report (7Hikita H. Takehara T. Kodama T. Shimizu S. Hosui A. Miyagi T. Tatsumi T. Ishida H. Ohkawa K. Li W. Kanto T. Hiramatsu N. Hennighausen L. Yin X.M. Hayashi N.

The staining also showed a significant increase in TUNEL-positive cells and cleaved caspase-3-positive cells in the liver (Fig. 1, B–D). Consistent with these histological observations, the levels of serum caspase-3/7 activity and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which can be used as indicators of hepatocyte apoptosis (22Baskin-Bey E.S.

Additionally, cleaved caspse-3 and -7 were detected in the livers of the Bcl-xL-knock-out mice by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). All of these findings indicated spontaneous hepatocyte apoptosis in these mice. Bim-knock-out mice did not show any phenotypes in the liver under physiological conditions (Fig. 1, B–F). Alternatively, the disruption of Bim significantly improved all of the parameters that are indicative of hepatocyte apoptosis in Bcl-xL-knock-out mice, including the TUNEL-positive cell counts, cleaved caspase-3-positive cell counts, serum ALT levels, and serum caspase-3/7 activity (Fig. 1, B–F). These findings clearly demonstrated that Bim was involved in the hepatocyte apoptosis caused by Bcl-xL disruption. It should be noted that the gene and protein expression levels of Bim were not different between the Bcl-xL-knock-out mice and their wild-type littermates (Fig. 1, A and G), indicating that the Bim expression levels observed in the healthy liver could induce hepatocyte apoptosis in the absence of the Bcl-2 family proteins. Of the five members of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, we previously reported that Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL played a pivotal anti-apoptotic role in maintaining hepatocyte integrity in the healthy liver (13Hikita H. Takehara T. Shimizu S. Kodama T. Li W. Miyagi T. Hosui A. Ishida H. Ohkawa K. Kanto T. Hiramatsu N. Yin X.M. Hennighausen L. Tatsumi T. Hayashi N. Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL cooperatively maintain integrity of hepatocytes in developing and adult murine liver.Hepatology. 2009; 50: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We thus examined the role of Bim in the hepatocyte apoptosis caused by Mcl-1 deficiency. We generated Mcl-1/Bim double knock-out mice (bim−/−mcl-1fl/flalb-cre) by mating the hepatocyte-specific Mcl-1-knock-out mice (mcl-1fl/flalb-cre) with the systemic Bim-knock-out mice (bim−/−). A Western blot study confirmed the disappearance of both Mcl-1 and Bim protein expression in the liver tissue of the double knock-out mice (bim−/−mcl-1fl/flalb-cre) (Fig. 2A). Consistent with our previous report (13Hikita H. Takehara T. Shimizu S. Kodama T. Li W. Miyagi T. Hosui A. Ishida H. Ohkawa K. Kanto T. Hiramatsu N. Yin X.M. Hennighausen L. Tatsumi T. Hayashi N. Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL cooperatively maintain integrity of hepatocytes in developing and adult murine liver.Hepatology. 2009; 50: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), hepatocyte-specific Mcl-1-knock-out mice showed apoptosis phenotypes very similar to those of the Bcl-xL-knock-out mice, as assessed by TUNEL staining (Fig. 2, B and C), cleaved caspase-3 staining (Fig. 2, B and D), serum caspase-3/7 activity (Fig. 2E), and serum ALT levels (Fig. 2F). In contrast, Mcl-1/Bim double knock-out mice showed significant improvement in these parameters (Fig. 2, B–F), indicating that Bim is also involved in the hepatocyte apoptosis induced by the disruption of Mcl-1. We previously reported that a small amount of Bid, which is another BH3-only protein, was constitutively active and was involved in the spontaneous hepatocyte apoptosis in Bcl-xL- or Mcl-1-knock-out mice (7Hikita H. Takehara T. Kodama T. Shimizu S. Hosui A. Miyagi T. Tatsumi T. Ishida H. Ohkawa K. Li W. Kanto T. Hiramatsu N. Hennighausen L. Yin X.M. Hayashi N.

Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL cooperatively maintain integrity of hepatocytes in developing and adult murine liver.Hepatology. 2009; 50: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether these BH3-only proteins redundantly or cooperatively promoted hepatocyte apoptosis in the absence of Bcl-xL. To this end, Bim/Bid/Bcl-xL triple knock-out mice (bim−/−bid−/−bcl-xfl/flalb-cre) were generated by mating the Bim/Bcl-xL double knock-out mice (bim−/−bcl-xfl/flalb-cre) with the Bid/Bcl-xL double knock-out mice (bid−/−bcl-xfl/flalb-cre). The offspring from the mating of bim+/−bid−/−bcl-xfl/flalb-cre mice with bim+/−bid−/−bcl-xfl/fl mice were examined at 6 weeks of age. A Western blot study confirmed that Bcl-xL, Bid, and Bim protein expression disappeared from the liver tissue of the triple knock-out mice (bim−/−bid−/−bcl-xfl/flalb-cre) (Fig. 3A). Liver sections of the Bim/Bid/Bcl-xL triple knock-out mice were histologically normal compared with those of the Bid/Bcl-xL double knock-out mice (bim+/+bid−/−bcl-xfl/flalb-cre), which still contained some hepatocytes with apoptotic morphologies (Fig. 3B). Both the number of TUNEL-positive cells and the serum caspase-3/7 activity in the triple knock-out mice were significantly lower than those in the Bid/Bcl-xL double knock-out mice and did not differ from their control Bid-knock-out or Bim/Bid double knock-out littermates (Fig. 3, B–D). Moreover, in contrast to the mild elevation of serum ALT levels in the Bid/Bcl-xL double knock-out mice, the levels in the triple knock-out mice were completely normal (Fig. 3E). These findings demonstrated that hepatocyte apoptosis in the absence of Bcl-xL was completely dependent on these two BH3-only proteins. We then attempted to further examine the involvement of Bim and Bid in hepatocyte apoptosis in the absence of both Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, which are two major anti-apoptotic proteins in the liver. Because, as we reported (13Hikita H. Takehara T. Shimizu S. Kodama T. Li W. Miyagi T. Hosui A. Ishida H. Ohkawa K. Kanto T. Hiramatsu N. Yin X.M. Hennighausen L. Tatsumi T. Hayashi N.

Genetic analysis has authenticated L. donovani uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (LdUPRT), an enzyme not found in mammalian cells, as the focal enzyme of pyrimidine salvage because all exogenous pyrimidines that can satisfy the requirement of the parasite for pyrimidine nucleotides are funneled to uracil and then phosphoribosylated to UMP in the parasite by LdUPRT. To characterize this unique parasite enzyme, LdUPRT was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity. Kinetic analysis revealed apparent Km values of 20 and 99 μm for the natural substrates uracil and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate, respectively, as well as apparent Km values 6 and 7 μm for the pyrimidine analogs 5-fluorouracil and 4-thiouracil, respectively. Size exclusion chromatography revealed the native LdUPRT to be tetrameric and retained partial structure and activity in high concentrations of urea. L. donovani mutants deficient in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, which require functional LdUPRT for growth, are hypersensitive to high concentrations of uracil, 5-fluorouracil, and 4-thiouracil in the growth medium. This hypersensitivity can be explained by the observation that LdUPRT is substrate-inhibited by uracil and 4-thiouracil, but 5-fluorouracil toxicity transpires via an alternative mechanism. This substrate inhibition of LdUPRT provides a protective mechanism for the parasite by facilitating purine and pyrimidine nucleotide pool balance and by sparing phosphoribosylpyrophosphate for consumption by the nutritionally indispensable purine salvage process.Background: Leishmania donovani salvage all pyrimidines through uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (LdUPRT).Results: LdUPRT phosphoribosylates uracil, 5-fluorouracil, and 4-thiouracil and is susceptible to substrate inhibition.Conclusion: LdUPRT recognizes pyrimidine analogs, and substrate inhibition by LdUPRT explains the supersensitivity of pyrimidine auxotrophs to uracil.Significance: Substrate inhibition of LdUPRT provides a mechanism for uracil susceptibility and offers a protective function for the parasite.
