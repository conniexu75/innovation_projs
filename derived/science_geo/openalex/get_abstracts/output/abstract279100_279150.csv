https://openalex.org/W1992124464,"The simple relation OmegaOmega-alpha = 0, where Omega is a measurable quantity such as strain and A and alpha are empirical constants, describes the behavior of materials in terminal stages of failure under conditions of approximately constant stress and temperature. Applicable to metals and alloys, ice, concrete, polymers, rock, and soil, the relation may be extended to conditions of variable and multiaxial stress and may be used to predict time to failure."
https://openalex.org/W2051659113,"Juvenile hormone has been implicated in the mediation of several reproduction-related events in adult insects, but had previously been found to play no role in the regulation of sex pheromone production and release behavior (""calling"") in moths. In females of the true armyworm moth, Pseudaletia unipuncta, juvenile hormone is shown to be essential to the initiation of both calling behavior and pheromone production. Females without corpora allata, the source of juvenile hormone, do not call and do not produce pheromone, but injection of juvenile hormone into allatectomized females restored these activities. The armyworm's control system has likely evolved in response to the adults' migratory behavior which may necessitate that mating be restricted to the period following migration."
https://openalex.org/W2020005691,"Ergodic theory is the theory of the long-term statistical behavior of dynamical systems. The baker's transformation is an object of ergodic theory that provides a paradigm for the possibility of deterministic chaos. It can now be shown that this connection is more than an analogy and that at some level of abstraction a large number of systems governed by Newton's laws are the same as the baker's transformation. Going to this level of abstraction helps to organize the possible kinds of random behavior. The theory also gives new concrete results. For example, one can show that the same process could be produced by a mechanism governed by Newton's laws or by a mechanism governed by coin tossing. It also gives a statistical analog of structural stability."
https://openalex.org/W2009110818,"Nonpoint sources of pollution, which are largely responsible for stressing regional and global life-supporting atmosphere, soil, and water, can only be reduced (and ultimately controlled) by input management that involves increasing the efficiency of production systems and reducing the inputs of environmentally damaging materials. Input management requires a major change, an about-face, in the approach to management of agriculture, power plants, and industries because the focus is on waste reduction and recycling rather than on waste disposal. For large-scale ecosystem-level situations a top-down hierarchical approach is suggested and illustrated by recent research in agroecology and landscape ecology."

https://openalex.org/W2041313466,"The images of the nucleus of comet Halley returned by the Giotto spacecraft reveal a number of active regions on the surface, one of which is near the expected location of the rotation pole. This feature is larger and brighter than other source regions, suggesting that the mechanism that drives this source is also different. At this active region near the rotation pole, the sun was circumpolar for a significant portion of the solar encounter. Continuous insolation heated the nucleus to greater depths than in other areas, producing the broad, active polar region."
