https://openalex.org/W2014282546,"The delivery of therapeutic drugs to solid tumours may be impaired by structural and functional abnormalities in blood and lymphatic vessels. Here we provide evidence that proliferating cancer cells cause intratumour vessels to compress and collapse. By reducing this compressive mechanical force and opening vessels, cytotoxic cancer treatments have the potential to increase blood perfusion, thereby improving drug delivery."

https://openalex.org/W2163564081,"Different diagnostic and prognostic groups of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) have been defined. However, accurate diagnosis and prediction of survival are sometimes difficult. Gene expression profiling might improve these classifications and bring new insights into underlying molecular mechanisms. We profiled 50 cancerous and noncancerous colon tissues using DNA microarrrays consisting of approximately 8000 spotted human cDNA. Global hierarchical clustering was to some extent able to distinguish clinically relevant subgroups, normal versus cancer tissues and metastatic versus nonmetastatic tumours. Supervised analyses improved these segregations by identifying sets of genes that discriminated between normal and tumour tissues, tumours associated or not with lymph node invasion or genetic instability, and tumours from the right or left colon. A similar approach identified a gene set that divided patients with significantly different 5-year survival (100% in one group and 40% in the other group; P=0.005). Discriminator genes were associated with various cellular processes. An immunohistochemical study on 382 tumour and normal samples deposited onto a tissue microarray subsequently validated the upregulation of NM23 in CRC and a downregulation in poor prognosis tumours. These results suggest that microarrays may provide means to improve the classification of CRC, provide new potential targets against carcinogenesis and new diagnostic and/or prognostic markers and therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2043064898,"Emergent quantum technologies have led to increasing interest in decoherence--the processes that limit the appearance of quantum effects and turn them into classical phenomena. One important cause of decoherence is the interaction of a quantum system with its environment, which 'entangles' the two and distributes the quantum coherence over so many degrees of freedom as to render it unobservable. Decoherence theory has been complemented by experiments using matter waves coupled to external photons or molecules, and by investigations using coherent photon states, trapped ions and electron interferometers. Large molecules are particularly suitable for the investigation of the quantum-classical transition because they can store much energy in numerous internal degrees of freedom; the internal energy can be converted into thermal radiation and thus induce decoherence. Here we report matter wave interferometer experiments in which C70 molecules lose their quantum behaviour by thermal emission of radiation. We find good quantitative agreement between our experimental observations and microscopic decoherence theory. Decoherence by emission of thermal radiation is a general mechanism that should be relevant to all macroscopic bodies."

In live cells, members of the B/R4 subfamily of RGS proteins selectively modulate G protein signaling depending on the associated receptor (GPCR). Here we examine whether GPCRs selectively recruit RGS proteins to modulate linked G protein signaling. We report the novel finding that RGS2 binds directly to the third intracellular (i3) loop of the Gq/11-coupled M1 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (M1 mAChR; M1i3). This interaction is selective because closely related RGS16 does not bind M1i3, and neither RGS2 nor RGS16 binds to the Gi/o-coupled M2i3 loop. When expressed in cells, RGS2 and M1 mAChR co-localize to the plasma membrane whereas RGS16 does not. The N-terminal region of RGS2 is both necessary and sufficient for binding to M1i3, and RGS2 forms a stable heterotrimeric complex with both activated Gqα and M1i3. RGS2 potently inhibits M1 mAChR-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in cell membranes by acting as an effector antagonist. Deletion of the N terminus abolishes this effector antagonist activity of RGS2 but not its GTPase-activating protein activity toward G11α in membranes. These findings predict a model where the i3 loops of GPCRs selectively recruit specific RGS protein(s) via their N termini to regulate the linked G protein. Consistent with this model, we find that the i3 loops of the mAChR subtypes (M1-M5) exhibit differential profiles for binding distinct B/R4 RGS family members, indicating that this novel mechanism for GPCR modulation of RGS signaling may generally extend to other receptors and RGS proteins.

Agonist occupancy of the GPCR activates a heterotrimeric G protein (Gαβγ) by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP on the Gα subunit (1Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). This initiates dissociation of the trimer into free Gα and Gβγ, which independently or in coordinated fashion activate downstream effectors and linked signaling pathways. Members of the regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) family of proteins are direct modulators of G protein activity. RGS proteins are best understood as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which bind to the activated form of Gα and accelerate its GTPase activity thereby promoting the termination of G protein signaling (2Berman D.M.

Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). By virtue of their interactions with activated Gα, RGS proteins also serve as effector antagonists to block activation of downstream effector molecules (6Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 7Carman C.V. Parent J.-L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweiss P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). All RGS proteins share a conserved RGS core domain of ∼130 amino acids that contains binding sites for Gα and is responsible for their GAP activity (5Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 8Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 9De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Outside of the RGS domain, however, the more than 30 family members are widely divergent. Some RGS proteins are quite complex and contain multiple domains for binding a variety of signaling proteins. Other RGS proteins are simple, with relatively short, featureless N- and C-terminal regions flanking the RGS domain. RGS proteins are classified into at least six subfamilies based on RGS domain identities, and related subfamily members also share conserved regions outside of their RGS domains (5Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 9De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The B/R4 subfamily contains the simplest of RGS proteins. Members of this subfamily (RGS1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -8, -13, and -16) share a conserved amphipathic helix near their N termini but have no other identifiable features outside of their RGS domains. These family members are often considered prototypical because they do not appear to have functions outside of modulating G protein activity. Although the biochemical mechanism of GAP activity and structure of RGS proteins has been well characterized, much less is understood about the regulation of RGS proteins in cells (8Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is how RGS proteins can function in cells to selectively control the activity of specific G proteins. In single-turnover GTP-hydrolysis assays and G protein binding experiments using purified proteins, many studies have demonstrated that most B/R4 RGS proteins share overlapping profiles of G protein interactions and nonselectively bind to and/or inhibit signaling by Giα, Goα, Gqα and Gtα (Refs. 5Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar and 9De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar and references therein). However, more recent studies have suggested that B/R4 RGS proteins can distinguish among receptor signaling pathways that are coupled to the same G protein when examined in the context of a living cell. One study demonstrated that recombinant RGS1, -2, -4, and -16 displayed different relative potencies of inhibiting signaling through Gq/11-linked muscarinic cholinergic, bombesin, or cholecystokinin receptors, suggesting that the particular GPCR could dictate RGS actions (10Xu X. Zeng W. Popov S. Berman D. Davignon I. Yu K. Yowe D. Offermanns S. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3549-3556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Similarly, selective disruption of endogenous expression of RGS3 or RGS5 mRNA and protein in rat vascular smooth muscle cells differentially enhanced cellular responses to carbachol or angiotensin, respectively (11Wang Q. Liu M.Y. Mullah B. Siderovski D.P. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24949-24958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, a separate study showed that RGS3, but not RGS1, -2, or -4, specifically inhibited gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor-mediated PI turnover in transfected COS cells (12Neill J.D. Duck W. Sellers J.C. Musgrove L.C. Scheschonka A. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The idea that GPCRs determine the specificity of RGS signaling in cells is also supported by a recent finding that RGS proteins selectively translocated from the cytoplasm or nucleus to the plasma membrane of a cell when co-transfected with a functionally coupled receptor (13Roy A.A. Lemberg K.E. Chidiac P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that GPCRs, either alone or in coordination with their linked G protein, can selectively recruit certain RGS proteins to the plasma membrane to determine their signaling functions, and point to a model in which GPCRs possess intrinsic differential affinities for RGS proteins. Based on their differing affinities for RGS protein recognition, GPCRs may recruit a specific RGS protein to act on its downstream G protein signaling pathway(s) (14Sierra D.A. Popov S. Wilkie T.M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Hepler J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 547-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms underlying functional coupling between certain GPCR and RGS proteins have remained obscure. One complex RGS protein (RGS12) contains a PDZ domain that may bind one GPCR (16Snow B.E. Hall R.A. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Bouchard D. Brothers C.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Gilman A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Siderovski D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17749-17755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, no other RGS proteins contain PDZ domains and there has not yet been any demonstration of a direct GPCR-RGS interaction. In this study, we begin to examine whether there is a direct physical interaction between RGS proteins and GPCRs that could dictate selectivity. For these studies, we used members of the B/4 subfamily of RGS proteins and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes as prototype protein binding partners. The mAChRs are members of the large family 1 of GPCRs. Five mAChR subtypes (M1-M5) have been identified and are expressed in the heart, vascular smooth muscle, brain, and peripheral nervous system (17Van Koppen C.J. Kaiser B. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 197-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although similar in overall amino acid identity, the subtypes differ most markedly among their third intracellular loops (i3) (18Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J.M. Buckley N.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 633-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). The mAChRs also differ in their signaling properties; M1, M3, and M5 stimulate Gq/11 to activate phospholipase Cβ and inositol lipid signaling, whereas M2 and M4 couple to Gi/o to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. For these studies, we took advantage of the highly diverse i3 loop subdomains of mAChRs as probes to explore interactions between mAChR subtypes and RGS proteins. This strategy has proven useful for identifying biologically important proteins that interact with full-length GPCRs (19Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Wu G. Benovic J.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7197-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 21McClatchy D.B. Knudsen C.R. Clark B.F. Kahn R.A. Hall R.A. Levey A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29268-29274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we report that the i3 loop of the M1 mAChR interacts directly and selectively with RGS2 through its N terminus. In contrast, RGS16 does not bind M1i3. We find that RGS2 simultaneously binds both the M1i3 and activated Gqα to form a stable heterotrimeric complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the capacity of RGS2 to inhibit M1 mAChR signaling corresponds with its capacity to bind to the M1i3 loop. Based on the results presented here, we propose a model for specificity of RGS signaling based on the selective recruitment of their N termini to the diverse i3 loops of GPCRs. Once bound to the receptor through its N terminus, the RGS protein is positioned to orient and optimize its activity toward the linked G protein to modulate its signaling. In this way, the specificity of RGS protein interactions with G proteins in cells is determined by selective RGS recognition of the linked receptor. RGS-HA pcDNA3.1 Constructs—cDNA encoding RGS proteins with an HA epitope tag at the C terminus (RGS-HA) were generated in our laboratory. RGS2-HA (human), RGS16-HA (mouse), RGS1-HA (human), and RGS4-HA (mouse) were amplified as a KpnI-XbaI fragments in which the antisense primer encoded an HA tag followed by a stop codon. For RGS2-HA the primers were 5′-GGGGTACCATGCAAAGTGCCATGTTCCTGGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GATCTCTAGATCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTATGTAGCATGGGGCTCCGTGG-3′ (antisense). For RGS16-HA the primers were 5′-GGGGTACCATGTGCCGCACCCTAGCCACCTTCCCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GATCTCTAGATCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAAGTGTGAAGGCTCAGCTGGGC (antisense). For RGS1-HA the primers were 5′-GGGGTACCATGCCAGGAATGTTCTTCTCTGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GATCTCTAGATCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTACTTTAGGCTATTAGCCTGC-3′ (antisense). For RGS4-HA the primers were 5′-GGGGTACCATGTGCAAAGGACTCGCTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GATCTCTAGATCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAGGCACACTGAGGGACTAGGG-3′ (antisense). The resulting PCR products were each isolated and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen) for expression in mammalian cells. RGS2-HA pcDNA3.1 served as the template for ΔNRGS2-HA, in which the first 78 amino acids of the protein were deleted. The sense primer was 5′-CAGGTACCATGCTGTGGTCAGAAGCATTTGACG-3′, and the antisense primer was the same as used for amplifying the full-length HA-tagged protein. The N2/RGS16 chimera was made by fusing amino acids 1-71 of RGS2 to the RGS box and C terminus of RGS16, beginning at Ser-53. This was achieved by amplifying the 5′ end of RGS2 as a HindIII fragment. The sense primer spanned the HindIII site in pCDNA3.1 multicloning region. The antisense primer introduced a silent point mutation to eliminate the RGS2 internal HindIII site and contained the RGS16 sequence that has a HindIII site. RGS16-HA in pcDNA3.1 was digested with HindIII to remove the 5′ end, and the N-terminal RGS2 HindIII fragment was ligated. The primers used were 5′-GCGTTTAAACTTAAGCTTGGTACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTGAGAAGCTTTTGATGAAAGCCTGCTGTTTGC-3′ (antisense). All constructs were verified by sequencing. RGS-His pET20b Constructs—RGS2, RGS16, and ΔNRGS2 were cloned into the pET20b vector (Novagen) for bacterial expression with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Each insert was amplified as a NdeI-NotI fragment from the corresponding pCDNA3.1 construct for insertion into pET20b. For RGS2 the primers were 5′-GGAATTCCATATGCAAAGTGCCATGTTCCTGGCTGTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCTGTAGCATGGGGCTCCGTGGTGATTTGTGG-3′ (antisense). For RGS16 the primers were 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTGCCGCACCCTAGCCACCTTCCCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCAGTGTGTGAAGGCTCAGCTGGGCTGCC-3′ (antisense). For ΔNRGS2 the primers were 5′-GGAATTCCATATGCTGTGGTCAGAAGCATTTGACG-3′ (sense) and the same antisense primer as was used for RGS2. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST)-mAChR i3 Constructs—GST-M1i3, GST-M2i3, GST-M3i3, GST-M4i3, and GST-M5i3 plasmids have been described previously (22Levey A.I. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GFP-tagged RGS Constructs and HA-tagged M1 mAChR—RGS2-GFP plasmid was prepared as described previously (13Roy A.A. Lemberg K.E. Chidiac P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). RGS16-GFP plasmid was prepared by subcloning RGS16-HA in frame upstream of GFP in the pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences). The insert was amplified as a KpnI-BamHI fragment using the same forward primer as for RGS16-HA pcDNA3.1 as described. The reverse primer was: 5′-GTGGATCCCGAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCG-3′. M1 mAChR cDNA containing an HA epitope tag placed in frame at the extreme N terminus of the coding sequence (HA-M1) was obtained from the Guthrie Institute. Gqα-His Construct—The construct for expression of C-terminally His6-tagged Gqα (GqαCH6) was described in Ref. 23Hepler J.R. Biddlecome G.H. Kleuss C. Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. J.

GST-mAChR i3 loop fusion proteins (GST-M1i3, GST-M2i3, GSTM3i3, GST-M4i3, and GST-M5i3) were transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli. For each protein, 1-liter cultures were grown in LB/carbenicillin and induced with 500 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted, and the cell pellets were suspended in 25 ml of harvest buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) and lysozyme. The pellets were then frozen at -80 °C overnight. Samples were thawed and sonicated, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g, 4 °C to collect soluble material. Streptomycin sulfate (30 mg) was added to precipitate remaining nucleic acid material, and the samples were centrifuged an additional time to produce the soluble bacterial lysate. The lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, 4 °C, rotating end-over-end to bind the fusion proteins. Protein-bead complexes were washed three times with harvest buffer and then stored as a slurry in harvest buffer at -80 °C. The concentration of GST protein bound to the glutathione resin varied among the GST fusion proteins. For each protein used, a single common batch of protein/beads were generated and aliquoted for freezing and storage at -80 °C. Direct quantitation of total bound protein by Bradford assay was unsuccessful because of nonspecific interaction of the resin with Bradford reagent. Therefore, the concentration of protein bound was determined by comparison of Coomassie staining intensity of GST fusion proteins with a known amount of protein standard (BSA). For experiments, the volume of beads used for each protein was adjusted to ensure that the same amount of total protein was used for binding interactions. Wild-type CHO-K1 cells (WT-CHO) were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (CellGro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 1× nonessential amino acids (CellGro), and penicillin/streptomycin. To produce cell lysates containing RGS-HA proteins, WT-CHO were grown to 80-90% confluence in 10-cm dishes and transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) using the protocol from the manufacturer. 24-36 h after transfection, cells were washed once with PBS and then lysed in harvest buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) (200 μl/plate). Lysates were scraped off the dish using a razor blade and incubated at 4 °C, rotating end-over-end for 30-60 min to solubilize the cells. Lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 300,000 × g (75,000 rpm) for 15 min in a TLA100.3 rotor to separate the insoluble material. The soluble lysate was diluted to 0.5% Triton X-100 in harvest buffer, then aliquoted and snap-frozen for use in GST pull-down assays. Lysates expressing each RGS-HA protein were assessed by Western blot using the HA antibody to determine the relative concentrations of RGS proteins. CHO cells transiently transfected with cDNA constructs (RGS2-GFP alone, RGS16-GFP alone, or these constructs co-transfected with cDNA encoding HA-M1 mAChR) were grown on sterile coverslips, fixed for 30 min with 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and rinsed three times with PBS containing 0.5% normal horse serum (PBS+). For anti-HA immunostaining, fixed coverslips were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA, 5% normal horse serum) containing 0.01% Triton X-100 to permeabilize cells. Anti-HA rabbit primary antibody was added to coverslips overnight at 4 °C at 1:500 dilution in blocking buffer, washed three times with PBS+ and incubated with Rhodamine Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature at 1:500 dilution in blocking buffer. Coverslips were washed three times with PBS+ and mounted onto slides using Vectashield mounting medium. Cells were scanned with an LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Heidelberg, Germany) as described previously (24Volipicelli L.A. Lah J.J. Levey A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47590-47598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For detecting GFP, fluorescence was excited using an argon laser at a wavelength of 488 nm and the absorbed wavelength was detected at 510-520 nm. For detecting Rhodamine Red, rhodamine fluorescence was excited using a helium-neon laser at a wavelength of 522 nm. The pinhole size was maintained at 1 airy unit for all images. RGS2-His, RGS16-His, and ΔNRGS2-His in pET20b were transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli. For each protein, 2-liter cultures were grown in LB/carbenecillin and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and the cell pellets suspended in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.02 m β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and snap-frozen to -80 °C. Cells were thawed and lysed using a French pressure cell press (Spectronic Instruments). Following lysis, 10 mm MgCl2 and 25 μg/ml DNase were added and the lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min. Lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and the volume increased to 100 ml with buffer A. The diluted soluble lysate was then loaded on an equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity column (2.0 ml) (Qiagen), and the flow-through was re-loaded through the column a second time. For RGS2-His and ΔNRGS2-His, the column was washed with 20 ml of wash buffer (0.05 m HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.02 m β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02 m imidazole, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and eluted with 0.5 m imidazole in wash buffer. RGS2-His and ΔNRGS2-His were dialyzed overnight into 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol. For RGS16-His, the column was washed in buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl and eluted in 0.3 mm imidazole in wash buffer. Purified protein concentrations were determined by Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and were estimated to be 75% pure as determined by Coomassie staining. GqαCH6 was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described (23Hepler J.R. Biddlecome G.H. Kleuss C. Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 496-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). CHO cell lysates expressing RGS-HA proteins (50-250 μl) or purified RGS-His protein were mixed with GST or GST-mAChR i3 bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (10-50 μl) with harvest buffer and protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins were added as determined by Coomassie staining. The total reaction volume was 250 μl. Reactions were incubated by rotating overnight at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed one time with harvest buffer, then one time with harvest buffer without Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer. Bound RGS proteins were detected by Western blot. For experiments in which Gqα-His was included, RGS2-His and Gqα-His were pre-incubated in harvest buffer along with 5 mm NaF, 5 mm MgCl2, 30 μm AlCl3, and 1 mm GDP for 10 min at room temperature, then 20 min on ice. GST or GST-M1i3 bound to glutathione-agarose beads was then added to the reaction and incubated and washed as above. Samples were boiled for 1 min, centrifuged briefly to pellet the beads, resolved on 13.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline with 5% milk, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.02% sodium azide) 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then probed with either mouse anti-HA antibody (Covance) or mouse anti-His (Qiagen) antibodies diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer for 1-2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20, then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Rockland) diluted 1:20,000 in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20. The protein bands were visualized using chemiluminescence and exposed to film. Assays were performed as previously described (6Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) with the following modifications; CHO cells stably expressing the M1 mAChR (M1-CHO cells) were grown to confluence in 150-mm dishes (3-5 dishes/experiment). Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped from the dish in phosphate-buffered saline (5 ml/plate) using a razor blade. Cells were pelleted for 10 min in a clinical centrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer (1 ml/dish; 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA) and Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Cells were passed 20 times through a ball-bearing cell cracker (0.0012-inch clearance), and 250 mm sucrose in hypotonic buffer was added to the homogenate. The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min, 4 °C at 500 × g to pellet the cell nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was then subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a TLA100.3 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C to separate cell membranes. The resulting membrane pellet was suspended in membrane buffer (250 μl/plate; 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2,2mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, and PMSF) by 10 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer. M1-CHO membranes (10 μl/reaction) were pre-incubated on ice with purified RGS-His in assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 80 mm KCl, and PMSF) for 30-90 min on ice to allow interaction of the RGS and M1 mAChRs. Next, 100 μm carbachol, 3 μm GTPγS, 10 mm GDPβS were added along with [3H]PIP2/PE vesicles. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1.3 mm CaCl2 for a total volume of 70 μl and incubated at 30 °C for 40 min. Reactions were terminated by precipitation with 250 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 100 μl of 10 mg/ml BSA. Samples were centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min. The soluble supernatants containing [3H]inositol phosphates were counted in a scintillation counter. Sf9 insect cells grown to a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml were triply infected with baculoviruses encoding M1-G11α fusion protein, G2β, and G2γ. The baculovirus encoding M1-G11α fusion protein was kindly provided by Dr. Tatsuya Haga (Gakushuin University, Tokyo, Japan) and baculoviruses encoding G1β and G2γ were a gift from Dr. Terry Hebert (Montreal Heart Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) (25Cladman W. Chidiac P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Following a 48-h infection at 27 °C, membranes were prepared essentially as described (25Cladman W. Chidiac P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by centrifugation (228 × g), washed with PBS, and finally resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). After a 10-min wait on ice, the cells were disrupted by Polytron and centrifuged at 500 × g to remove any whole cells, and the membrane fraction pelleted at 48,000 × g for 30 min, resuspended in 0.01 volume of the lysis buffer, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C. The membranes were assessed for muscarinic receptor density usin"

https://openalex.org/W2044807782,"Sphingomyelin (SM) synthase has been assumed to be involved in both cell death and survival by regulating pro-apoptotic mediator ceramide and pro-survival mediator diacylglycerol. However, its precise functions are ambiguous due to the lack of molecular cloning of SM synthase gene(s). We isolated WR19L/Fas-SM(-) mouse lymphoid cells, which show a defect of SM at the plasma membrane due to the lack of SM synthase activity and resistance to cell death induced by an SM-directed cytolytic protein lysenin. WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells were also highly susceptible to methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) as compared with the WR19L/Fas-SM(+) cells, which are capable of SM synthesis. By expression cloning method using WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells and MβCD-based selection, we have succeeded in cloning of a human cDNA responsible for SM synthase activity. The cDNA encodes a peptide of 413 amino acids named SMS1 (putative molecular mass, 48.6 kDa), which contains a sterile α motif domain near the N-terminal region and four predicted transmembrane domains. WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells expressing SMS1 cDNA (WR19L/Fas-SMS1) restored the resistance against MβCD, the accumulation of SM at the plasma membrane, and SM synthesis by transferring phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine to ceramide. Furthermore, WR19L/Fas-SMS1 cells, as well as WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells supplemented with exogenous SM, restored cell growth ability in serum-free conditions, where the growth of WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells was severely inhibited. The results suggest that SMS1 is responsible for SM synthase activity in mammalian cells and plays a critical role in cell growth of mouse lymphoid cells.

Diverse kinds of phospho- and glycerolipids such as diacylglycerol (DAG), 1The abbreviations used are: DAG, diacylglycerol; SM, sphingomyelin; PC, phosphatidylcholine; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; SAM, sterile α motif; WST-8, 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; MBP, maltose-binding protein; NBD, 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)). 1The abbreviations used are: DAG, diacylglycerol; SM, sphingomyelin; PC, phosphatidylcholine; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; SAM, sterile α motif; WST-8, 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; MBP, maltose-binding protein; NBD, 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)). inositol phosphatides, and phosphatidic acid are recognized as bioactive molecules in cell growth and survival (1English D. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 341-347Google Scholar, 2Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Google Scholar). Sphingolipid ceramide has recently emerged as a signal mediator of cell functions including apoptosis, differentiation, and secretion (3Pettus B.J. Chalfant C.E. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 114-125Google Scholar). Various stresses such as ultraviolet, irradiation, heat shock, hypoxia, and biological factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and Fas antibody require ceramide generation to execute apoptosis, suggesting the implications of SM as a source of ceramide generation in the induction of cell death (4Okazaki T. Kondo T. Kitano T. Tashima M. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 685-692Google Scholar, 5Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Google Scholar). It was reported that SM dose-dependently inhibits both deoxycholate-induced apoptosis and subsequent hyper-proliferation in colon epithelial cells (6Moschetta A. Portincasa P. van Erpecum K.J. Debellis L. Vanberge-Henegouwen G.P. Palasciano G. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2003; 48: 1094-1101Google Scholar) and decreases the number of aberrant crypts of colon (7Dillehay D.L. Webb S.K. Schmelz E.M. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Nutr. 1994; 124: 615-620Google Scholar), suggesting the implications of SM in cell death and growth.SM is produced by SM synthase, which is thought to be the only enzyme to synthesize SM in mammalian cells (8Voelker D.R. Kennedy E.P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2753-2759Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes the reaction in which phosphocholine moiety is transferred from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to ceramide. Thus, the activation of SM synthase subsequently increases the levels of DAG and decreases ceramide at the same time (8Voelker D.R. Kennedy E.P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2753-2759Google Scholar). DAG is an important signaling molecule for cell growth through protein kinase C activation (9Hampton R.Y. Morand O.H. Science. 1989; 2461050Google Scholar, 10Pagano R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 202-205Google Scholar, 11Moscat J. Cornet M.E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Larrodera P. Lopez-Alanon D. Lopez-Barahona M. Biochem. Soc.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 431-437Google Scholar) and acts competitively against ceramide-induced apoptosis (4Okazaki T. Kondo T. Kitano T. Tashima M. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 685-692Google Scholar, 13Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Google Scholar). It has been reported that after thioacetamide-induced injury, the SM/PC ratio significantly increased in microsomal fraction from liver, suggesting the involvement of SM synthase in tissue recovery (14Miro-Obradors M.J. Osada J. Aylagas H. Sanchez-Vegazo I. Palacios-Alaiz E. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 941-946Google Scholar). In cerebellar astrocytes, the level of ceramide is rapidly down-regulated by basic fibroblast growth factor via activating SM synthase (15Riboni L. Tettamanti G. Viani P. Cerebellum. 2002; 1: 129-135Google Scholar). In SV40-transformed lung fibroblasts, SM synthase regulates the levels of ceramide and DAG in an opposite direction (16Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Google Scholar). We recently reported that SM synthase was activated to inhibit ceramide generation in IL-2-induced proliferation of natural killer cells, 2Y. Taguchi, T. Kondo, M. Watanabe, Y. Kozutumi, and T. Okazaki, submitted for publication. 2Y. Taguchi, T. Kondo, M. Watanabe, Y. Kozutumi, and T. Okazaki, submitted for publication. whereas the activity in nucleus was inhibited with ceramide generation in Fas-induced T cell apoptosis (17Watanabe M. Kitano T. Kondo T. Yabu T. Taguchi Y. Tashima M. Umehara H. Domae N. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1-8Google Scholar). We also showed its in vivo implication that the level of ceramide was decreased via activation of SM synthase in chemotherapy-resistant blast cells obtained from refractory leukemia patients than in chemotherapy-sensitive leukemic blasts (18Itoh M. Kitano T. Watanabe M. Kondo T. Yabu T. Taguchi Y. Iwai K. Tashima M. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 415-423Google Scholar). Thus, SM synthase is assumed to play an important role in cell death and survival, in vitro as well as in vivo.We previously proposed the “SM cycle,” a pathway that consisted of SM synthase and sphingomyelinase as a novel biological system to regulate the cellular level of ceramide for cell death and differentiation (19Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Google Scholar). In contrast to the studies of the acid and neutral sphingomyelinases in cell death (20Chatterjee S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 79-96Google Scholar, 21Cremesti A.E. Goni F.M. Kolesnick R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 47-53Google Scholar), the biological implication of SM synthase has not been elucidated due to the lack of molecular cloning of its responsible gene(s). We recently found mouse lymphoid cell variants designated WR19L/Fas-SM(-), which are defective of SM synthesis and susceptible to methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD)-induced cell death (30Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Itabe H. Takano T. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34028-34034Google Scholar). By an expression cloning method using WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells and MβCD-based cell selection, we isolated a human cDNA responsible for SM synthase activity. The cDNA clone encodes a peptide of 413 amino acids, named SMS1, which contains a sterile α motif (SAM) domain and four putative transmembrane domains. SMS1 was identical to the peptide that was recently identified as a human SM synthase by Huitema et al. (24Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F.H.M. Holthuis J.C.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 33-44Google Scholar). In serum-free condition, where the cell growth of WR19L/Fas-SM(-) was inhibited, the cells expressing SMS1 cDNA (WR19L/Fas-SMS1) restored the growth ability and accumulation of SM at the surface of the plasma membrane. The restoration of cell growth was also observed when WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells were maintained in the serum-free medium supplemented with exogenous SM. Here, we show the critical role of SM synthesized through SM synthase in mammalian cell growth, and the localization, active site and biological function of SMS1 are also discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Lysenin, MβCD, and ceramide from bovine brain were purchased from Sigma; PC from egg yolk, SM from bovine brain, and a cell viability assay kit with 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (WST-8) were from Nacalai tesque (Kyoto, Japan); GP2–293 packaging cell, pLIB retroviral expression vector, and human HeLa cDNA retroviral expression library were from Clontech; d-erythro-C6-NBD-ceramide and C6-NBD-sphingomyelin were from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA); l-[U-14C]serine, cytidine 5′-diphospho [methyl-14C]choline, l-3-phosphatidyl [N-methyl-14C]choline, 1,2-dipalmitoyl, and [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin were from Amersham Biosciences.Cell Culture—WR19L/Fas cells were kindly gifted from Dr. Yonehara (Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University). The SM-defective WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells and the SM-containing WR19L/Fas-SM(+) cells were isolated from the original WR19L/Fas cells by a dilution cloning method. The cells were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 75 μg/ml kanamycin in 5% CO2 and 100% humidity at 37 °C. For culture in serum-free medium, the cells were washed, reseeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml, and incubated in the RPMI 1640 medium with 5 μg/ml human insulin and bovine holo transferrin in the presence or absence of 50 μm SM in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After 48 h incubation, the cell numbers were counted with dye exclusion method using 0.25% trypan blue (Nakalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan).Cell Labeling—The cells were reseeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml in the RPMI 1640 medium with 2% FBS and l-[14C]serine (specific activity; 155 mCi/mmol) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 36 h. The labeled cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2 h. The cell lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (19Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Google Scholar), applied on a silica Gel 60 TLC plate (Merck), and developed with solvent containing methyl acetate/propanol/chloroform/methanol/0.25% KCl (25:25:25:10:9). The radioactive spots were visualized and quantified by using a BAS 2000 Image Analyzer (Fuji Film).FACS Analyses—The cells were incubated with 500 ng/ml lysenin in the presence of 20 μg/ml propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 15 min and analyzed with FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences). For detection of SM localized at the plasma membrane, the cells were stained on ice for 30 min with non-toxic lysenin fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP-lysenin) (25Yamaji-Hasegawa A. Makino A. Baba T. Senoh Y. Kimura-Suda H. Sato S.B. Terada N. Ohno S. Kiyokawa E. Umeda M. Kobayashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22762-22770Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. T. Kobayashi (The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Japan). The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% FCS and 0.1% NaN3 and incubated with rabbit anti-MBP antiserum (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) on ice for 30 min. After being washed again, the cells were incubated for 30 min with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and subjected to fluorescence-activating cell sorter (FACS) analysis using FACS Calibur. The data analysis was performed by Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences).Confocal Microscopy—For visualization of SM localized at the plasma membrane, the cells settled onto slides coated with poly-l-lysine were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with lysenine-MBP at 4 °C for 45 min followed with anti-MBP. After being stained with a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG monoclonal antibody, the cells were examined using confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 310 laser scan confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).Expression Cloning of SMS1 cDNA—The expression cloning method performed in this study was based on the study of Hanada et al. (26Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Google Scholar). Pantropic retroviral particles containing the G glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) were prepared using a human HeLa cDNA retroviral expression library kit and GP2–293 packaging cells (Clontech). After infection for 24 h, the WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells were cultured in the RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% FBS overnight. After being washed with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, the cells were incubated in 1.5 mm MβCD in RPMI 1640 medium for 5 min at 37 °C, replenished with the normal culture medium to a final concentration of FBS at 5%, and then cultured at 37 °C for 60 h. The cells were reseeded, cultured in the RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% FBS overnight, and subjected again to the treatment with appropriate concentrations of MβCD. After a total of two cycles of 1.5 mm MβCD treatment followed by two cycles of 3 mm and two subsequent cycles of 5 mm, an MβCD-resistant variant of WR19L/SM(-) was isolated by a limiting dilution.By genomic PCR using primers specific to the pLIB expression vector (5′ and 3′ pLIB Primer, Clontech), the 2.0-kb cDNA integrated in the genome of the MβCD-resistant cell was amplified and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). After sequencing and computer analysis, the cDNA was subcloned into the pLIB expression vector and transfected into the WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells via the VSV-G retroviral particles. A resultant cell was isolated by a limiting dilution method, which was designated WR19L/Fas-SMS1 cells, and subjected to various assays. Integration of the cDNA into the genome of WR19L/Fas-SMS1 cells was confirmed with PCR.Assay for Sphingomyelin Synthase Activity—The cells were homogenized in an ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysates containing 500 μg of cell protein were added to a reaction solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μm C6-NBD-ceramide, 120 μm PC and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (19Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Google Scholar), applied on the TLC plates, and developed with solvent containing chloroform/methanol/12 mm MgCl2 in H2O (65:25:4). The fluorescent lipids were visualized by FluorImager SI system (Amersham Biosciences). For the assay for transferase activity, 20 μm ceramide and 120 μm [N-methyl-14C]PC (specific activity; 57 mCi/mmol) or [methyl-14C]CDP-choline (specific activity; 54 mCi/mmol) were used in the reaction solution instead of the NBD-ceramide and PC. The radioactive spots were visualized using the BAS 2000 system.Assay for Viability and Growth Rate of Cells Exposed to MβCD and Lysenin—For the assay using MβCD, 1 × 106 of the cells were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of the serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, treated with appropriate concentrations of MβCD, and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 5 min. After the addition of 1 ml of the normal culture medium, the cells were further incubated for 12 h. The viability of the cells was measured using a cell viability kit with WST-8 (Nakalai tesque). For the assay using lysenin, 7 × 105 of the cells were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline, treated with the appropriate concentrations of lysenin and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 1 h. After the addition of FBS, the cell number was counted with the 0.25% trypan blue dye exclusion method.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMouse Lymphoid Cells Defective of Sphingomyelin Synthase Activity—During investigation of the sphingolipid metabolism in mouse lymphoid cells named WR19L/Fas, which overexpress the human Fas antigen, the variant clones altering SM synthase activity (from 150 to nearly 0 pmol/mg protein/h) have been isolated. One of the variants (clone 6) severely diminished the SM synthase activity (Fig. 1A). Conversion of C6-NBD-ceramide to C6-NBD-SM in the cell lysate of the clone 6, named WR19L/Fas-SM(-), was not detected on a TLC plate, in contrast to the clone 2 showing the highest SM synthase activity, named WR19L/Fas-SM(+) (Fig. 1B). This finding was supported by the fact that WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells did not synthesize [14C]serine-labeled SM (Fig. 1C).Lysenin is reported as an SM-direct cytolysin purified from the earthworm (27Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Google Scholar), for which binding to SM causes poring of the plasma membrane and subsequent cell death (22Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Google Scholar, 23Shakor A.B. Czurylo E.A. Sobota A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 1-6Google Scholar, 25Yamaji-Hasegawa A. Makino A. Baba T. Senoh Y. Kimura-Suda H. Sato S.B. Terada N. Ohno S. Kiyokawa E. Umeda M. Kobayashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22762-22770Google Scholar). Hanada et al. (22Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Google Scholar) previously showed that Chinese hamster ovary cells, which express SM in the outer surface of the plasma membrane, were sensitive to lysenin-induced cell death. They also showed that reduced accumulation of SM in the variant Chinese hamster ovary cells, LY-A and LY-B, causes the significant resistance against lysenin (22Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Google Scholar). In LY-A cells, the reduction of SM is caused by the lack of non-vesicular transporter for ceramide between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (CERT) (26Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Google Scholar), whereas in LY-B cells, it is due to the lack of LCB1, a component of serine palmitoyltransferase (22Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Google Scholar). CERT is involved in SM synthesis by transferring ceramide from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasmic surface of Golgi apparatus (26Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Google Scholar, 31Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 673-685Google Scholar). Recently, Kobayashi and co-workers (25Yamaji-Hasegawa A. Makino A. Baba T. Senoh Y. Kimura-Suda H. Sato S.B. Terada N. Ohno S. Kiyokawa E. Umeda M. Kobayashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22762-22770Google Scholar) reported a modified lysenin, which specifically binds to SM without the induction of cell death. By using the modified lysenin conjugated with MBP, we examined the accumulation of SM on the cellular surface of WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells. Binding of the modified lysenin was positively detected in WR19L/Fas-SM(+) cells but not in WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells by FACS analysis and confocal microscopy using anti-MBP antibody (Fig. 1D), indicating that the accumulation of SM on the outer surface of the WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells was severely reduced. The results were supported by the fact that WR19L/Fas-SM(+) cells underwent cell death by treatment with the cytotoxic lysenin, whereas WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells did not, when we examined cell viability by staining with propidium iodide and subsequent FACS analysis (Fig. 1E). These facts suggest that the severe reduction of SM at the cellular surface of WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells is due to the lack of enzymatic activity of SM synthase.Expression Cloning of a Human cDNA Responsible for Resistance to Methyl-β-cyclodextrin-induced Cell Death—It has been reported that SM strongly interacts with cholesterol in biological and artificial membranes (28Slotte J.P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 13-27Google Scholar) and that SM is required to form the membrane microdomains (lipid rafts) related to cell functions such as cell death and growth (29Ostermeyer A.G. Beckrich B.T. Ivarson K.A. Grove K.E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34459-34466Google Scholar, 30Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Itabe H. Takano T. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34028-34034Google Scholar). LY-A cells were sensitive to MβCD-induced cell death due to the decrease of the SM level in plasma membrane (30Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Itabe H. Takano T. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34028-34034Google Scholar). We similarly observed that WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells were highly sensitive to MβCD-induced cell death, whereas WR19L/Fas-SM(+) cells were not (Fig. 2D). This finding allowed us to screen WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells complemented with the ability of SM synthesis using MβCD as a selective agent. Using a pantropic retroviral transfection system, WR19L/SM(-) cells were transfected with a cDNA expression library of the human HeLa cell, and the variant cells, which were resistant to MβCD due to the expression of SM in the plasma membrane, were selected. The variant cells were isolated to a single clone by a limiting dilution method. The purified cells integrated a human cDNA of 1967 bp in the genome, which encodes a peptide of 413 amino acids with 48.6 kDa of a predicted molecular mass (Fig. 2A). The BLAST algorithm (32Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) and the SOSUI program (33Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1998; 14: 378-379Google Scholar) suggested that this peptide carries a SAM domain in the N-terminal region and four transmembrane helices, respectively (Fig. 2B). The SAM domain is suggested to be involved in signal transduction, development, and transcriptional regulation (34Bork P. Koonin E.V. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 313-318Google Scholar, 35Barrera F.N. Poveda J.A. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Neira J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46878-46885Google Scholar). A variety of proteins such as ephrin-related receptor tyrosine kinase, a variant of p53 (p73), and DAG kinase δ contain the SAM domain(s), which may play a role in protein-protein or protein-lipid interaction (35Barrera F.N. Poveda J.A. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Neira J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46878-46885Google Scholar, 36Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Hofmann K. Bork P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 249-253Google Scholar). Recently, Huitema et al. (24Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F.H.M. Holthuis J.C.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 33-44Google Scholar) reported a family of SM synthases using a bioinformatics and functional cloning strategy in yeast. They identified the human cDNAs encoding the peptides that shared a sequence motif with the lipid phosphate phosphatases and Aur1p proteins required for inositolphosphorylceramide production in yeast (24Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F.H.M. Holthuis J.C.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 33-44Google Scholar). One of the human peptides, SMS1, was identical to our peptide. They further demonstrated that SMS1 was localized at Golgi apparatus and predicted the six transmembrane domains and an exoplasmic catalytic site, which is consistent with the characteristics of SM synthase suggested previously (37Futerman A.H. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8650-8657Google Scholar, 38van Helvoort A. Stoorvogel W. van Meer G. Burger N.J. J.

Molecular structure of SMS1, including the transmembrane domains, should be clarified by further detailed analysis.Fig. 2Expression cloning of a human cDNA responsible for cellular resistance to methyl-β-cyclodextrin. A, nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid sequence of SMS1. Putative SAM domain sequence and transmembrane (TM) regions are indicated with the thin and thick underline, respectively.

Collins E.A. Marchesini N. El-Bawab S. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32733-32743Google Scholar) that the Pseudomonas PlcH gene product, which is a secreted protein, is a putative SM synthase. The SMS1 peptide was suggested to be an integral membrane protein and did not show any significant homology with the PlcH product.The SMS1 cDNA Is Responsible for Sphingomyelin Synthase in Mammalian Cells—Huitema et al. (24Huitema K. van den Dikkenberg J. Brouwers J.F.H.M. Holthuis J.C.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 33-44Google Scholar) demonstrated the SM synthase activity in the yeast cells expressing SMS1 cDNA. Here, we demonstrated that the loss of SM synthesis in the SM-defective mammalian cells was complemented with SMS1 cDNA. WR19L/Fas-SM(-) cells transfected with SMS1 cDNA, named WR19L/Fas-SMS1 (Fig. 2C), restore the resistance against MβCD-induced cell death (Fig. 2D). Radiolabeling of cellular lipids with [14C]serine revealed that [14C]SM synthesis was also restored in WR19L/Fas-SMS1 cells (Fig. 3A), and whole cell lysate from WR19L/Fas-SMS1 cells generated C6-NBD-SM in the presence of C6-NBD-ceramide and PC (Fig. 3B). These results strongly suggest that the SMS1 cDNA is indispensable for SM synthase activity in mammalian cells. Furthermore, SM synthase activity in WR19L/Fas-SMS1 cells was detected in the presence of [14C]PC but not [14C]CDP-choline (Fig. 3C), suggesting that PC was a phosphocholine donor for SM synthesis by SMS1. These results indicate that the SMS1 protein possesses the characteristics consistent with those of SM synthase reported elsewhere previously (8Voelker D.R. Kennedy E.P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2753-2759Google Scholar).Fig. 3Restoration of SM synthesis and SM synthase activity in WR19L/Fas-SMS1.

https://openalex.org/W2033235106,"The fundamental mechanism that gives rise to high-transition-temperature (high-T(c)) superconductivity in the copper oxide materials has been debated since the discovery of the phenomenon. Recent work has focused on a sharp 'kink' in the kinetic energy spectra of the electrons as a possible signature of the force that creates the superconducting state. The kink has been related to a magnetic resonance and also to phonons. Here we report that infrared spectra of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta (Bi-2212), shows that this sharp feature can be separated from a broad background and, interestingly, weakens with doping before disappearing completely at a critical doping level of 0.23 holes per copper atom. Superconductivity is still strong in terms of the transition temperature at this doping (T(c) approximately 55 K), so our results rule out both the magnetic resonance peak and phonons as the principal cause of high-T(c) superconductivity. The broad background, on the other hand, is a universal property of the copper-oxygen plane and provides a good candidate signature of the 'glue' that binds the electrons."
https://openalex.org/W2007028310,"Embryonic development is tightly controlled. The clustered genes of the Hox family of homeobox proteins play an important part in regulating this development and also proliferation. They specify embryonic structures along the body axis, and are associated with normal and malignant cell growth. The cell-cycle regulator geminin controls replication by binding to the licensing factor Cdt1, and is involved in neural differentiation. Here, we show that murine geminin associates transiently with members of the Hox-repressing polycomb complex, with the chromatin of Hox regulatory DNA elements and with Hox proteins. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in the chick neural tube demonstrate that geminin modulates the anterior boundary of Hoxb9 transcription, which suggests a polycomb-like activity for geminin. The interaction between geminin and Hox proteins prevents Hox proteins from binding to DNA, inhibits Hox-dependent transcriptional activation of reporter and endogenous downstream target genes, and displaces Cdt1 from its complex with geminin. By establishing competitive regulation, geminin functions as a coordinator of developmental and proliferative control."

Gap-junctional channels are aqueous channels responsible for cell-to-cell communication that allow for the exchange of solutes of Mr ≤ 1,000.

Since studies on the regulation of Cx43 by PKC in cells are difficult to interpret because of the complexity of the PKC signaling pathways and the possible presence of cytosolic regulatory factors, we decided to assess the regulation of purified Cx43. Our results using purified recombinant Cx43 GJHs indicate that phosphorylation of Ser-368 produces a conformational change that reduces GJH permeability and that this effect does not require cytosolic factors. Recombinant Baculoviruses—Three constructs coding for Cx43 were created for these studies: (a) wild-type rat Cx43 (Cx43), (b) Cx43 fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at the C terminus (Cx43-EGFP), and (c) Cx43 in which Ser-368 was substituted with Ala (Cx43-S368A). Cx43 was amplified by PCR using the rat Cx43 DNA as template (a gift from Dr. Scott John, see Ref. 9John S.A. Kondo R. Wang S.Y. Goldhaber J.L. Weiss J.N. J. Biol.

The PCR products digested with XhoI and EcoRI were ligated to the plasmid pBlueBac 4.5/V5-His (Invitrogen) cut with the same enzymes. EGFP was amplified by PCR from pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) with EcoRI and HindIII flanking sites for in-frame cloning at the 3′ end of the Cx43 DNA. The PCR product digested with EcoRI and HindIII was ligated to Cx43 into pBlueBac 4.5/V5-His cut with the same enzymes to create the Cx43-EGFP fusion protein. The pBlueBac 4.5/V5-His vector was used as a source of the His6 tag added to the C-terminal end of all constructs for Ni2+ affinity purification. The DNAs coding for Cx43 and Cx43-EGFP, plus the His tag at the C terminus, were excised with BamHI and SalI and ligated into the baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac (Invitrogen). The S368A mutant was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange multisite site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following oligonucleotide: 5′-CGACCTTCCAGCAGAGCCGCCTCCCGCGCCAGCAGCAGGCCTCGG-3′. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated following the instructions of the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). The viruses were produced in Sf9 cells grown at 27 °C in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.05 mg/ml gentamycin. Cell density was ∼106 cells/ml. A scheme of the Cx43s engineered is shown in Fig. 1A. DNA sequencing of the constructs was carried out at the Protein Chemistry Core Laboratory of The University of Texas Medical Branch. Western Blot Analysis—Western blots were performed as described previously (22Han E.S. Vanoye C.G. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1370-C1378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a rabbit anti-rat Cx43 polyclonal antibody against the Cx43 C terminus (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody. Purification of Wild-Type Cx43 and Cx43-S368A—Protein expression was carried out in High-Five insect cells in suspension, grown in 300-ml baffled flasks containing 100 ml of Excell 401 medium supplemented with 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells (106 cells/ml) grown at room temperature were shaken at 200 rpm and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Generally cells were harvested 72 h postinfection by centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline solution, and the final pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen pellets were used for purification immediately or stored at -80 °C. For purification, cells were thawed in a buffer containing 1 mm bicarbonate and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and lysed with a Dounce homogenizer. The membranes were alkali-extracted as described previously (23Stauffer K.A. Kumar N.A. Gilula N.B. Unwin P.N. J.

Briefly, after addition of NaOH to a 20 mm final concentration, the lysate was sonicated with a probe sonicator, incubated on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. In some experiments, purification was performed from native membranes without alkali extraction. The membranes were solubilized with 2.5% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside or 2.3% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) in 2 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm PMSF, and 10 mm glycine/NaOH, pH 10, at a protein concentration <2 mg/ml. The suspension was sonicated and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Unsolubilized material was separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. Solubilized Cx43s were diluted with 15 volumes of 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, 100 mm HEPES, and 0.2% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside or 2.3% OG, pH 8.0. Diluted samples were loaded at a speed of 0.5 ml/min, at 4 °C, on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with the dilution buffer. The column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer (10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, containing 0.01% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside or 2.3% OG and 20 mm imidazole). Imidazole, 250 mm in washing buffer, was added for elution. For the isoosmolar sucrose gradient experiments (see below), 459 mm urea was present in the elution buffer. Analysis of the Oligomeric State of Purified Cx43—The oligomerization of solubilized Cx43 was determined by gel filtration on Sephacryl S300HR (16/60 prepacked column, Amersham Biosciences) using an ÄKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). For these experiments, Cx43-EGFP in 2.3% OG, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, was run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min (0.5-ml total volume, ∼0.5 mg/ml Cx43-EGFP, with or without standard molecular weight markers added) on the column equilibrated with the same buffer. Molecular weights were calculated from the linear relationship between Kav and the log of the molecular weight. The standards were run under the same conditions as the Cx43-EGFP samples and had the following molecular masses: 669 kDa (thyroglobulin), 440 kDa (ferritin), 232 kDa (catalase), 158 kDa (aldolase), and 67 kDa (albumin). Blue dextran 2000 (∼2,000 kDa) was used to determine the void volume. Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation of Cx43—Purified proteins were dephosphorylated as described by Kim et al. (26Kim D.Y. Kam Y. Koo S.K. Joe C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5581-5587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Approximately 30 μg of purified Cx43 or Cx43-S368A in 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.3% OG, and 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, were mixed with 0.1 volumes of agarose-conjugated calf intestinal phosphatase (50 units/ml, Sigma), and the mixture was incubated for 3 h at 25 °C with gentle agitation. Reactions were stopped by the removal of the enzyme-conjugated agarose beads by centrifugation. Dephosphorylated Cx43 and Cx43-S368A were phosphorylated by PKC as described by Sáez et al. (27Sáez J.C. Nairn A.C. Czernk A.J. Spray D.C. Hertzberg E.L. Greengard P. Bennett M.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) for Cx32 with minor modifications. Briefly 30 μg of dephosphorylated Cx43 were phosphorylated by rat brain PKC (1–2 μg, Calbiochem) in the presence of 200 μm ATP, 5 mm Ca2+,5 mm Mg2+,50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine (Avanti, Alabaster, AL), and 3 μg/ml 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol (Sigma). The reaction volume was generally 100 μl, and the reaction proceeded for 2 h at room temperature. Phosphorylation was confirmed by autoradiography using 10 nCi of [γ-32P]ATP (1,000 cpm/pmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) in the reaction described above. For these experiments, either Cx43 or Cx43-S368A was precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (16% Tris, glycine gels). Films were exposed at -80 °C before development. For quantitative assessments of the phosphorylation level, Cx43 at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml was phosphorylated in the presence of 10 nCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The phosphorylated protein was then labeled with 100 μm fluorescein maleimide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 15 min at 25 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of a 5-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol, and then the free radioactive label and the free dithiothreitol-reacted fluorescein maleimide were removed from 50 μl of the reaction by filtration through a G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). Measurements of radioactivity and fluorescence were performed in aliquots of the filtrate. The protein amount was estimated from the fluorescence and parallel Cx43 fluorescence/protein calibration curves using the BCA protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad with bovine serum albumin as standard. Reconstitution of Wild-Type Cx43 and Cx43-S368A—The reconstitution procedure for Cx43 and Cx43-S368A was a modification of published techniques (28Davey R.A. Hamson C.A. Healey J.J. Cunningham J.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8096-8102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Harris A.L. Walter A. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. Zimmerberg J. Mol. Brain. Res. 1992; 15: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly proteins were reconstituted in a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine at a 2:1 molar ratio. The lipids in chloroform stocks were mixed and lyophilized overnight under argon. The dry film was rehydrated in 75 μl of OG-containing washing buffer/mg of lipid and warmed to 37 °C until it became transparent. OG-solubilized proteins were added to the lipid-detergent mixture and dialyzed through a Spectra/Pro 6,000–8,000 molecular weight cut-off membrane (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA) for 24 h at room temperature against 500 ml of detergent-free washing buffer containing 10 ml of a 50% (w/v) suspension of Biobeads SM-2 (Bio-Rad). Large unilamellar vesicles for the transport and proteolysis experiments (∼100-nm diameter) were obtained by extrusion (Mini-Extruder, Avanti). For the sedimentation analysis, lissamine rhodamine B-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine was added (phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylserine:phosphatidylethanolamine ratio of 2:1:0.05) to label the liposomes for easy identification. For these experiments, the buffer contained 459 mm urea. Sucrose Uptake—Sucrose permeability of the proteoliposomes containing purified Cx43 GJHs was assessed by the transport-specific density shift technique (26Kim D.Y. Kam Y. Koo S.K. Joe C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5581-5587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30Harris A.L. Walter A. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr.

Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 357-377Google Scholar) and by a rapid filtration assay. For the shift assay, the proteoliposomes containing lissamine rhodamine B-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine were layered onto a linear isoosmolar sucrose gradient (0–400 mm sucrose with a reverse urea gradient) in detergent-free buffer. The gradient was usually centrifuged on a swinging bucket Beckman SW55Ti rotor at 300,000 × g for 8 h at 4 °C, and the location of the proteoliposomes was determined in fractions collected from the top to the bottom of the gradient tubes. The fluorescence of samples excited at 560 ± 4 nm was measured at 590 ± 4 nm (Fluorolog-2, SPEX, Edison, NJ). In most of the experiments, the proteoliposomes were loaded with Lucifer Yellow by adding the fluorescent probe at a concentration of 2 mm during the extrusion procedure. The non-trapped Lucifer Yellow was removed by filtration through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). Lucifer Yellow fluorescence was measured in the sedimentation gradient fractions at an excitation of 430 ± 4 nm and an emission of 540 ± 4 nm. To measure sucrose uptake by rapid filtration, proteoliposomes were incubated at 25 °C in washing buffer containing 2 mm sucrose and 10 nCi/μl [14C]sucrose (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, specific activity of 7.5 mCi/mmol). Filtration was through 0.2-μm nitrocellulose filters (Whatman). Radioactivity of the filters was measured by liquid scintillation after washing with 45 ml of ice-cold washing buffer containing 10 μm Gd3+, a blocker of gap-junctional channels and GJHs (32Eskandari S. Zampighi G.A. Leung D.W. Wright E.M. Loo D.D. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 185: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 33Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C647-C654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Tryptophan Fluorescence Measurements—Tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of OG-solubilized Cx43 and Cx43-S368A were obtained on a SPEX CMT1 with excitation at 295 ± 4 nm. Data were obtained at protein concentrations between 0.1 and 0.3 μm in 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.3% OG, and 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, in 1-ml quartz cuvettes. The spectra shown were subtracted from the background (buffer alone). Trypsin Digestion—Proteoliposomes were incubated with sequencing grade modified trypsin (V5111, Promega, Madison, WI) at a protein: trypsin ratio of 200:1 (w/w). Typically proteoliposomes containing 20 μg of Cx43 or Cx43-S368A were incubated with trypsin at 37 °C, and the reactions were stopped at varying times by adding SDS gel sample buffer and increasing the temperature to 95 °C. In the control experiments shown, 1 mm PMSF was added before trypsin. Other Techniques—Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad using bovine serum albumin as standard. To detect possible contaminants, the highly sensitive protein gel stain SYPRO Ruby (Molecular Probes) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistics—Data shown are means ± S.E. Statistically significant differences were assessed by the Student's t test for unpaired data or one-way analysis of variance as appropriate. Purification of Cx43 Overexpressed in Insect Cells—Our general strategy was to take advantage of the fluorescence of Cx43-EGFP to determine the best conditions for expression, solubilization, and purification and then to assess whether those conditions were also the best ones for the non-fluorescent Cx43 and Cx43-S368A (see Fig. 1A for schematics of these proteins). We found that initial trials with Cx43-EGFP indeed facilitated the initial screening and that the biochemical and functional properties of Cx43-EGFP and Cx43 were essentially identical in terms of detergent solubility, oligomerization, reconstitution efficiency, and permeability regulation by PKC-mediated phosphorylation. In this section, we summarize the main results of the expression, purification, and reconstitution of the Cx43s. Fig. 1, B and C, shows that a good expression level of Cx43-EGFP in High-Five cells is reached 2–3 days after infection. This time course of Cx43 expression was similar to that previously published for the expression of Cx32 (23Stauffer K.A. Kumar N.A. Gilula N.B. Unwin P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). There was a good correlation between the expression assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B) and the cell fluorescence (Fig. 1C). The latter method has the advantages that it can be used in real time and is simpler. The results for the expression of Cx43 and Cx43-S368A were similar (data not shown). Fig. 1 also shows that the His-tagged Cx43 can be easily purified based on its affinity for Ni2+. The Coomassie Blue- and SYPRO Ruby-stained gels (Fig. 1, D and E, respectively) show that the preparation of Cx43 is highly purified, i.e. no contaminants were detected. The yield of Cx43 and Cx43-EGFP was 5–10 mg/liter of cells, whereas that of Cx43-S368A was ∼70% of that of Cx43 (data not shown). The purified preparations obtained from membranes that were not alkali-extracted (see “Experimental Procedures”) also appeared homogeneous, but the yield was somewhat lower. Structural, biochemical, and functional studies have shown that gap-junctional hemichannels are oligomers composed of six connexin molecules (for a review, see Ref. 1Harris A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the oligomerization state of the purified Cx43 we performed gel filtration experiments on Cx43-EGFP solubilized in 2.3% OG. Fig. 1F shows that the major fluorescence peak (calculated molecular mass of 517 kDa) is compatible with a Cx43-EGFP hexamer with ∼18% of the complex apparent weight in bound detergent. The absorbance peaks labeled 1 and 2 correspond to the 669- and 440-kDa markers (which did not affect Cx43 elution) added to the Cx43-EGFP sample. The smaller fluorescence peak is compatible with monomeric Cx43-EGFP. Similar results were obtained with Cx43 in 0.3% decyl-maltopyranoside (not shown). The predominance of connexons in the detergent-solubilized preparation was confirmed by determination of the sedimentation coefficients on a sucrose gradient (data not shown), a technique routinely used for the assessment of connexin quaternary structure (see Ref. 25Falk M.M. Buehler L.K. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 2703-2716Google Scholar). From the results in this section, we conclude that Cx43 in our preparation contains predominantly Cx43 assembled as connexons (70–80% of the total Cx43 from the gel filtration experiment data). Ser-368 of Cx43 Is Phosphorylated by PKC—To test Cx43 function, we compared the permeability of GJHs reconstituted in liposomes in the dephosphorylated and PKC-phosphorylated states. We dephosphorylated the purified proteins with alkaline phosphatase (see “Experimental Procedures”). Dephosphorylated protein was then phosphorylated by PKC. Thus, we studied dephosphorylated and PKC-phosphorylated Cx43s in the absence of endogenous phosphorylation by other kinases. Pilot time course experiments using radiolabeled ATP showed that, under the conditions of our experiments, phosphorylation of Cx43 by PKC was complete by 1 h. Fig. 2A shows a representative autoradiography of Cx43 and Cx43-S368A phosphorylated by PKC in the presence of radiolabeled ATP. It is clear that the phosphorylation by PKC was substantially reduced when Ser-368 was substituted with Ala. The results of quantitative Pi incorporation studies show a maximal incorporation of Pi of ∼2 and 1 mol/mol of Cx43 and Cx43-S368A, respectively (Fig. 2B). In control experiments performed in the absence of PKC Cx43 phosphorylation was <8% of the value in the presence of PKC. The calculated decrease in phosphorylation by the S368A mutation (∼60 and ∼75% from the stoichiometry and densitometry analyses, respectively) is consistent with previous observations that indicate that Ser-368 is the major phosphorylation target of PKC and that phosphorylation also occurs at Ser-372 (16Lampe P.D. TenBroek E.M. Burt J.M. Kurata W.E. Johnson R.G. Lau A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 17Sáez J.C. Nairn A.C. Czernk A.J. Fishman G.I. Spray D.C. Hertzberg E.L. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2131-2145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that changes in the phosphorylation state of Ser-372 are not involved in the activation of Cx43 GJH carboxyfluorescein permeability by PKC blockers (33Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C647-C654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The observation that the decrease in Pi incorporation in Cx43-S368A is ∼1 mol/mol of protein suggests that under the conditions of these experiments all Cx43 Ser-368 residues are phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of Ser-368 by PKC Reduces the Permeability of Cx43 GJHs—Previous studies using mutagenesis and pharmacological agents that affect the PKC signaling pathway suggested that phosphorylation of Ser-368 reduces the permeability of Cx43 gap-junctional channels to small hydrophilic solutes (16Lampe P.D. TenBroek E.M. Burt J.M. Kurata W.E. Johnson R.G. Lau A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the effects of PKC-mediated phosphorylation are direct (i.e. due to phosphorylation of Cx43) or indirect (i.e. via other signaling pathways affected by the PKC activation or involving regulatory factors or phosphorylation by PKC of one or more cytosolic factors). To determine whether or not the regulation of Cx43 GJH permeability is direct, we carried out functional studies with purified Cx43 GJHs reconstituted into liposomes. Purified Cx43 was reconstituted in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine liposomes by dialysis/extrusion as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At protein:lipid ratios of 1:25, 1:60, 1:100, and 1:280 (w/w) essentially all the protein was incorporated into the liposomes. The reconstitution efficiency for Cx43-EGFP and Cx43-S368A was also >90%. In all experiments Cx43 amounts were measured in the proteoliposomes (i.e. after reconstitution, not inferred from the reconstitution efficiency). We assessed sucrose permeability by measuring the migration of the proteoliposomes on a linear isoosmolar sucrose/urea gradient, a metho"

CHF down-regulates rapid delayed-rectifier K+ current (IKr) and delays cardiac repolarization. We studied the effects of TNF-α on cloned HERG K+ channel (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) in HEK293 cells and native IKr in canine cardiomyocytes with whole-cell patch clamp techniques. TNF-α consistently and reversibly decreased HERG current (IHERG). Effects of TNF-α were concentration-dependent, increased with longer incubation period, and occurred at clinically relevant concentrations. TNF-α had similar inhibitory effects on IKr and markedly prolonged action potential duration (APD) in canine cardiomyocytes. Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that HERG protein level was slightly higher in canine hearts with tachypacing-induced CHF than in healthy hearts, and TNF-α slightly increased HERG protein level in CHF but not in healthy hearts. In cells pretreated with the inhibitory anti-TNFR1 antibody, TNF-α lost its ability to suppress IHERG, indicating a requirement of TNFR1 activation for HERG suppression. Vitamin E or MnTBAP (Mn(III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride), a superoxide dismutase mimic) prevented, whereas the superoxide anion generating system xanthine/xanthine oxidase mimicked, TNF-α-induced IHERG depression. TNF-α caused robust increases in intracellular reactive oxygen species, and vitamin E and MnTBAP abolished the increases, in both HEK293 cells and canine ventricular myocytes. We conclude that the TNF-α/TNFR1 system impairs HERG/IKr function mainly by stimulating reactive oxygen species, particularly superoxide anion, but not by altering HERG expression; the effect may contribute to APD prolongation by TNF-α and may be a novel mechanism for electrophysiological abnormalities and sudden death in CHF.

Nordoy I. Aass H. Espevik T. Simonsen S. Froland S.S. Gullestad L. Am. J. Cardiol. 1999; 83: 376-382Google Scholar) and experimental CHF (3Irwin M.W. Mak S. Mann D.L. Qu R. Penninger J.M. Yan A. Dawood F. Wen W.H. Shou Z. Liu P. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1492-1498Google Scholar). Circulating concentrations of TNF-α and soluble TNF receptors are independent predictors of mortality in CHF (4Deswal A. Petersen N.J. Feldman A.M. Young J.B. White B.G. Mann D.L. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2055-2059Google Scholar). Patients with CHF are at increased risk of sudden death due to cardiac arrhythmias. CHF increases action potential duration (APD) (5Beuckelmann D.J. Nabauer M. Erdmann E. Circ. Res. 2002; 73: 379-385Google Scholar), leading to early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias (6Marban E. Nature. 2002; 415: 213-218Google Scholar). Polymorphic ventricular tachycardias, likely related to arrhythmogenic afterdepolarizations, are common in CHF (6Marban E. Nature. 2002; 415: 213-218Google Scholar, 7Nuss H.B. Kaab S. Kass D.A. Tomaselli G.F. Marban E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H80-H91Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying APD prolongation in CHF remain incompletely understood. The rapid delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr) is crucial in cardiac repolarization. The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) encodes the pore-forming α-subunit of IKr and congenital or drug-induced abnormalities in HERG protein function are a common cause of the long QT syndrome. Simulations of cellular electrophysiology predict IKr inhibition to cause EADs in failing, but not nonfailing, myocytes (8Priebe L. Beuckelmann D.J. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1206-1223Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that transgenic mice overexpressing TNF-α with heart failure had significantly prolonged APD (9London B. Baker L.C. Lee J.S. Shusterman V. Choi B-R. Kubota T. McTiernan C.F. Feldman A.M. Slama G. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H431-H441Google Scholar). It is unknown whether TNF-α affects cardiac K+ channels. We therefore examined the hypothesis that TNF-α might affect HERG/IKr, thereby potentially contributing to CHF-related repolarization abnormalities. Cell Disposition—HEK293 cells stably expressing HERG were a kind gift from Drs. Zhou and January. Cell culture and handling procedures have been described previously (10Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were isolated from healthy adult mongrel dogs as described in detail previously (11Shi H. Wang H. Wang Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 497-507Google Scholar, 12Yue L. Feng J. Li G.R. Nattel S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H2157-H2168Google Scholar). The procedures for animal use were in accordance with institutional guidelines. Whole-cell Patch Clamp Recording—Patch clamp techniques have been described in detail elsewhere (13Wang J. Wang H. Han H. Zhang Y. Yang B. Nattel S. Wang Z. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2645-2648Google Scholar, 14Zhang Y. Wang H. Wang J. Han H. Nattel S. Wang Z. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 125-132Google Scholar, 15Wang H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 10417-10426Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted at 36 ± 1 °C. For current recordings in canine myocyte studies, the following were included in the bath to block contaminating currents: CdCl2 (200-μmol/liter, L-type Ca2+ current), 4-aminopyridine (1 mmol/liter, transient outward K+ currents), glyburide (10 μmol/liter, ATP-sensitive K+ current), and 293B (10 μmol/liter, slow delayed-rectifier K+ current). Action potentials were recorded in the current clamp mode with Tyrode solution free of ion channel blockers. TNF-α was either added to the extracellular solution 10 min after formation of whole-cell configuration (acute studies), or cells were incubated with TNF-α in the medium for 10 h before patch clamp recording (long term exposure). Western Blot—The procedures were similar to those described previously (15Wang H. Zhang Y. Cao L. Han H. Wang J. Yang B. Nattel S. Wang Z. Cancer Res. 2003; 62: 4843-4848Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-HERG raised in rabbit against highly purified peptide (CY)EEL PAGAPELPQD GPT, corresponding to residues 1118–1133 of human HERG was purchased from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel). Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Measurement—5-(and-6)-Chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DFDA) from Molecular Probes was used to detect oxidative activity in living cells as detailed previously (16Zhang Y. Han H. Wang J. Wang H. Yang B. Wang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10417-10426Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Group data are mean ± S.E. Paired t tests were used for single comparisons. Kinetics were analyzed with CLAMPFIT (pCLAMP 8.0) or Graphpad Prism. IHERG was elicited by 2-s depolarizations followed by 2-s repolarizing steps (Fig. 1, inset). Currents were recorded immediately after formation of whole-cell configuration and series resistance compensation. Comparisons were made between control cells (without TNF-α) and cells incubated for 10 h with various TNF-α concentrations from 0.01 to 10 ng/ml, which are within the pathophysiological range of TNF-α levels (∼0.1 ng/ml) (17Anker S.D.

IHERG density was reduced by TNF-α, with effects that were concentration- and voltage-dependent, being larger at more negative potentials (Fig. 1A). IHERG kinetics were unaltered by TNF-α. Exposure to TNF-α for 15 min concentration-dependently decreased IHERG. IHERG amplitude was decreased by 9, 16, and 35% by TNF-α at 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml, respectively. Results at 100 ng/ml are shown in Fig. 1B. Depression of IKr by TNF-α was reproduced in both dog atrial and ventricular myocytes (Fig. 1C). APD50 and APD90, duration at 50 and 90% repolarization, respectively, were both significantly longer in single ventricular cells preincubated with TNF-α at 10 ng/ml in Tyrode solution for 10 h relative to control cells (Fig. 1D). Western blot analysis of HERG protein levels in the membrane preparations extracted from HERG-expressing HEK293 cells and from the ventricular myocytes of healthy dogs or dogs with tachypacing induced CHF was performed. A band of around 135 kDa was identified by anti-HERG antibody, and the band was abolished after the antibody had been neutralized by its antigenic peptide. TNF-α treatment neither significantly alter HERG protein level in HEK293 cells nor in healthy dogs. HERG protein level was slightly higher in CHF than in healthy dogs and was slightly increased by TNF-α in CHF dogs (Fig. 2A). To clarify whether TNF-α acts on IHERG via activation of TNF receptor I (TNFR1), we incubated HEK293 cells with H389 (an inhibitory anti-TNFR1 antibody) for 1 h before patch clamp recording upon acute exposure to 100 ng/ml TNF-α or beginning 1 h before prolonged (10 h) exposure to 1 ng/ml TNF-α. H389 prevented suppression of IHERG by subsequent acute or prolonged application of TNF-α. Data from prolonged exposure experiments are shown in Fig. 2B. Activation of TNFR1 can stimulate overproduction of intracellular ROS (20Suematsu N. Tsutsui H. Wen J. Kang D. Ikeuchi M. Ide T. Hayashidani S. Shiomi T. Kubota T. Hamasaki N. Takeshita A. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1418-1423Google Scholar). To investigate whether ROS mediates TNF-α-induced HERG depression, we assessed the effects of TNF-α on IHERG in cells pretreated with the antioxidant vitamin E (VitE). Pretreatment with VitE for 2 h prevented IHERG reduction by TNF-α (Fig. 2C). Another antioxidant MnTBAP (Mn(III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride), a superoxide dismutase mimetic, produced similar preventive effects on TNF-α-induced HERG impairment (Fig. 2D). By contrast, preincubation of cells with superoxide anion generating system xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X/XO) mimicked the inhibitory effect of TNF-α on IHERG (Fig. 2E). To confirm that intracellular ROS production was indeed stimulated by TNF-α, we detected ROS level using CM-H2DFDA fluorescence dye to stain the cells. The cells stained with fluorescence intensity ≥5 times the background were defined as positive staining, and the number of cells with positive staining was pooled from five fields. The intensity of staining was analyzed by densitometric scanning using the LSM program, and the data were normalized to the control values without TNF-α (0.1 and 10 ng/ml) treatment (16Zhang Y. Han H. Wang J. Wang H. Yang B. Wang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10417-10426Google Scholar). Under control conditions, cells stained by CM-H2DCFDA were sparse, and the staining was weak. Yet with TNF-α treatment, the number of the cells with positive staining was considerably higher and the cells were stained evenly throughout the cytoplasm. Pretreatment with VitE or MnTBAP drastically diminished the number and the intensity of staining (Fig. 2F). Similar results were obtained with isolated canine ventricular myocytes; TNF-α (0.1 ng/ml) markedly increased ROS level and co-application with ViTE (100 μm) or MnTBAP (5 μm) prevented the effects of TNF-α (Fig. 2G). Heart failure is associated with APD and QT interval prolongation, believed to contribute to the occurrence of sudden cardiac death (6Marban E. Nature. 2002; 415: 213-218Google Scholar, 7Nuss H.B. Kaab S. Kass D.A. Tomaselli G.F. Marban E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H80-H91Google Scholar). We show here that TNF-α suppresses IHERG in HEK293 cells and IKr in dog cardiomyocytes and prolonged APD. Depression of IHERG/IKr, as produced by TNF-α in this study, may contribute to delayed repolarization and associated malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias with increased TNF-α level in patients with CHF. Ionic remodeling in CHF has been studied (21Tomaselli G.F. Marban E. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 270-283Google Scholar). L-type Ca2+ current density appears to be unaltered (20Suematsu N. Tsutsui H. Wen J. Kang D. Ikeuchi M. Ide T. Hayashidani S. Shiomi T. Kubota T. Hamasaki N. Takeshita A. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1418-1423Google Scholar). The inward-rectifier K+ current is consistently reduced (5Beuckelmann D.J. Nabauer M. Erdmann E. Circ. Res. 2002; 73: 379-385Google Scholar). The transient outward K+ current (Ito) is also reduced, potentially causing APD prolongation (5Beuckelmann D.J. Nabauer M. Erdmann E. Circ. Res. 2002; 73: 379-385Google Scholar, 22Nabauer M. Beuckelmann D.J. Erdmann E. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 386-394Google Scholar). However, inhibition of Ito reduces APD in human atrial cells (23Escande D. Coulombe A. Faivre J.F. Deroubaix E. Coraboeuf E. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: H142-H148Google Scholar), canine atrial cells (12Yue L. Feng J. Li G.R. Nattel S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H2157-H2168Google Scholar), and dog Purkinje fibers (24Lee J.H. Rosen M.R. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1994; 5: 232-240Google Scholar). The effect of Ito on the AP depends largely on the magnitude of IK (25Nygren A. Fiset C. Firek L. Clark J.W. Lindblad D.S. Clark R.B. Giles W.R. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 63-81Google Scholar). Tsuji et al. (26Tsuji Y. Opthof T. Kamiya K. Yasui K. Liu W. Lu Z. Kodama I. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 48: 300-309Google Scholar) showed IKr, measured as E-4031-sensitive tail current, to be ∼36% smaller in rabbits with ventricular tachypacing-induced CHF than in healthy rabbits. Lodge and Normandin (27Lodge N.J. Normandin D.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 3211-3221Google Scholar) demonstrated earlier that IKr, measured as dofetilide-sensitive tail current, reduced by ∼45% in the BIO TO-2 strain of cardiomyopathic hamster of 10 months old, derived from the BIO 53.58 animals and providing a model of dilated low output heart failure, compared with the 10-month-old control (BIO F1B) hamsters. A recent study by London et al. (9London B. Baker L.C. Lee J.S. Shusterman V. Choi B-R. Kubota T. McTiernan C.F. Feldman A.M. Slama G. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H431-H441Google Scholar) showed significant APD prolongation in transgenic mice which overexpressed TNF-α and developed heart failure. Our study suggests that TNF-α may be an important mediator of CHF-induced IKr reduction and is the first to demonstrate that TNF-α can modulate cardiac K+ channels. We further demonstrated that pretreatment with VitE or MnTBAP prevented, whereas X/XO mimicked, TNF-α-induced IHERG depression. The effects of VitE and MnTBAP are likely due to their antioxidant actions because TNF-α increased the intracellular ROS level in a concentration-dependent manner in both HEK293 cells and canine ventricular myocytes, more specifically O2·¯ level because VitE or MnTBAP effectively prevented the increase. In line with our finding, a recent study published during the course of this study clearly demonstrated the ability of TNF-α to stimulate mitochondrial production of ROS in cardiomyocytes (20Suematsu N. Tsutsui H. Wen J. Kang D. Ikeuchi M. Ide T. Hayashidani S. Shiomi T. Kubota T. Hamasaki N. Takeshita A. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1418-1423Google Scholar). It has also been shown that ROS is one of the key deleterious factors in failing heart (28Choudhary G. Dudley Jr., S.C. Congest. Heart Fail. 2002; 8: 148-155Google Scholar, 29Byrne J.A. Grieve D.J. Cave A.C. Shah A.M. Arch. Mal. Coeur. Vaiss. 2003; 96: 214-223Google Scholar). Our data therefore indicate that TNF-α-induced HERG depression occurs at the functional level, but not at the expression levels (TNF-α did not alter HERG protein content), and the functional impairment of HERG channels by TNF-α is mediated by ROS, particularly O2·¯. Circulating TNF-α levels predict mortality in CHF, and therapies directed against TNF-α may limit the pathophysiologic consequences (1McTiernan C.F. Feldman A.M. Curr. Cardiol. Rep. 2000; 2: 189-197Google Scholar). In healthy human subjects, the TNF-α level is below 0.01 ng/ml, but in patients with heart failure, it can increase to over 0.1 ng/ml (17Anker S.D. Volterrani M. Egerer K.R. Felton C.V. Kox W.J. Poole-Wilson P.A. Coats A.J. Q. J. Med. 1998; 91: 199-203Google Scholar, 18Ferrari R. Bachetti T. Confortini R. Opasich C. Febo O. Corti A. Cassani G. Visioli O. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1479-1486Google Scholar, 19Liu L. Zhao S.P. Int. J. Cardiol. 1999; 69: 77-82Google Scholar). TNF-α significantly inhibited IHERG over this concentration range (e.g. by ∼35% at plateau voltages from –10 to +10 mV in cells exposed to 0.1 ng/ml TNF-α for 10 h). Our study might have underestimated the effects of TNF-α on APD because the myocytes were incubated with TNF-α at 4 °C to maintain good quality of the cells. Our observations provide new insights into the potential molecular mechanisms underlying electrophysiological abnormalities and sudden arrhythmic death in patients with CHF.

The resulting N-terminal fragments of both ATF6 isoforms, which have conserved basic leucine-zipper and DNA binding domains but divergent transcriptional activation domains, translocate to the nucleus where they bind to ER stress-response elements (ERSE) in ER stress-response genes (ERSRG), such as GRP78. Although it is known that ATF6α is a potent activator of ERSRGs, the transcriptional potency and functions of ATF6β remain to be explored. Accordingly, N-terminal fragments of each ATF6 isoform (N-ATF6α and N-ATF6β) were overexpressed in HeLa cells and the effects on GRP78 induction were assessed. When expressed at similar levels, N-ATF6α conferred ∼200-fold greater GRP78 promoter activation than N-ATF6β. Because ER stress activates nuclear translocation of both ATF6α and β and because both bind to ERSEs, the effect of co-expressing them on GRP78 induction was assessed. Surprisingly, N-ATF6β inhibited N-ATF6α-mediated GRP78 promoter activation in a dominant-negative manner. Moreover, N-ATF6β inhibited TN-mediated GRP78 promoter activation, which requires endogenous ATF6α. ATF6 isoform-specific small inhibitory RNAs were used to show that, as expected, endogenous ATF6α was required for maximal ERSRG induction; however, endogenous ATF6β moderated ERSRG induction. These results indicate that compared with ATF6α, ATF6β is a very poor activator of ERSRG induction and it represses ATF6α-mediated ERSRG induction. Thus, ATF6β may serve as a transcriptional repressor functioning in part to regulate the strength and duration of ATF6α-mediated ERSRG activation during the ER stress response.

The proteins encoded by a number of genes induced under such conditions are targeted to the ER where they act as chaperones to aid in folding and thus counteract the stress. A regulatory element located in many of these ER stress-response genes (ERSRG) is the ER stress-response element (ERSE), which is required for transcriptional induction. ATF6α, a member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors, is required for the maximal induction of numerous ERSGs (5Zhu C. Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 4957-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 6Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). ATF6α is comprised of 670 amino acids and resides in the ER membrane (6Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Upon ER stress, the cytosolic N-terminal portion of ATF6α (N-ATF6α) comprising ∼400 amino acids is released as a result of regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) (7Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 8Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-ATF6α possesses a transcriptional activation domain (TAD), basic leucine-zipper (b-Zip) domain, DNA binding domain, and nuclear localization signals. N-ATF6α translocates to the nucleus where it combines with several other proteins to form an ERSE-binding complex that is responsible for the induction of ERSGs such as the ER chaperone, glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78) (7Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 8Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol.

N-ATF6α is rapidly degraded in a proteasome-mediated process, and mutated inactive forms of N-ATF6α are slowly degraded (10Thuerauf D.J. Morrison L.E. Hoover H. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20734-20739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, similar to several other potent transcription factors that exert rapid transient effects (11Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the degradation of ATF6α upon transcriptional engagement apparently serves as a mechanism to rapidly turn off ERSG induction. Another member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors (G13), which is also an ER membrane protein, was recently shown to be structurally homologous to ATF6α and to be cleaved during ER stress to generate an N-terminal fragment of approximately 400 amino acids (12Haze K. Okada T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Because of its high degree of homology to ATF6α, G13 has been named ATF6β (12Haze K. Okada T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). N-ATF6α and N-ATF6β possess highly conserved b-Zip domains and DNA binding domains. This conservation apparently allows N-ATF6α and β to bind to ERSEs as homodimers or heterodimers (13Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar); however, the functional significance of the binding of N-ATF6β to ERSEs, either alone or as a heterodimer with N-ATF6α, is currently unknown. Although N-ATF6α and β have conserved b-Zip domains and DNA binding domains located near the center of each protein, the structure of the N-terminal region of N-ATF6α, which possesses the TAD, differs markedly from that of N-ATF6β. Notably, an 8 amino acid sequence located in the TAD of ATF6α, which is required for maximal transcriptional activity (10Thuerauf D.J. Morrison L.E. Hoover H. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20734-20739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), is absent from ATF6β. This structural difference led us to hypothesize that compared with N-ATF6α, N-ATF6β should exhibit much lower transcriptional activity (10Thuerauf D.J. Morrison L.E. Hoover H. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20734-20739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, if ATF6β is a poor transcriptional activator yet can bind to ERSEs with or in place of ATF6α, it seems probable that ATF6β might serve as an endogenous repressor of the transcriptional induction effects of ATF6α. This study was undertaken to test these hypotheses. HeLa Cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa cells were resuspended at 5–9 × 106 cells/400 μl of cold Dulbecco's PBS and electroporated in a 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvette at 250 V and 950 microfarads using a GenePulser II Electroporator (Bio-Rad). The cells were then plated at a density of 0.5 × 106/24-mm well plate for luciferase and β-galactosidase enzyme assays, 1.5 × 106/35-mm well plate for Western blots, or 3 × 106/60-mm dish for metabolic labeling experiments. Cytomegalovirus-Galactosidase—Cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase, which codes for a galactosidase reporter driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter, was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. N-ATF6α and N-ATF6α-DN—Construction of vectors encoding FLAG-tagged versions of N-ATF6α (3× FLAG-ATF6α-(1–373)) and N-ATF6α-DN (3× FLAG-ATF6α-(94–373)) has been described previously (11Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All of the references to FLAG in this paper refer to 3× FLAG epitope. N-ATF6β and N-ATF6β-DN—N-ATF6β (3× FLAG-ATF6β-(1–392)) was prepared by PCR using HeLa cDNA as a template and PCR primers that introduced an XhoI site at amino acid 1 and a termination codon and EcoR1 site at amino acid 392. The resulting PCR product was cloned into 3× FLAG-pcDNA3.1, which was described previously (10Thuerauf D.J. Morrison L.E. Hoover H. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20734-20739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). N-ATF6β-DN (3× FLAG-ATF6β-(116–392)) was prepared by PCR using the FLAG-ATF6β-(1–392) as a template and a PCR primer that introduced an XhoI site at amino acid 116 and the reverse sequencing primer. The resulting PCR product was excised with XhoI and EcoR1 and cloned into 3× FLAG-pcDNA3.1. GRP78-ERSE-Luc—This construct encodes an active ERSE from the human GRP78 gene driving SV40/luciferase in the vector pGL2-p (Promega) and has been described previously (11Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). GRP78-Promoter-Luc—This construct encodes the GRP78 promoter from -284 to +7 driving luciferase. It was created by PCR using HeLa genomic DNA as a template and a sense primer that begins at base -284 and includes a KpnI restriction site and an antisense primer at +341. The resulting PCR product was digested with KpnI and SalI, creating GRP78-Promoter (-284 to +7), which was ligated into the vector pGL2 (Promega). β-Galactosidase—After the indicated times, cells were lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Gly-Gly, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EDTA, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cell lysate was centrifuged, and 100 μl of supernatant was combined with 400 μl of galactosidase buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mg/ml chlorophenol red-d-galactopyranoside, and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). After incubation for 1 h, the absorbance was measured at 570 nm. Luciferase—After cell lysis and centrifugation as described above, 100-μl samples of cell lysate were combined with 100 μl of luciferase buffer (the above described lysis buffer containing 45 mm MgSO4, 0.3 mm d-luciferin, and 3 mm ATP). An Optocompt II luminometer (MGM Instruments, Inc) was used to measure light emission of each sample for 10 s. Relative luciferase activities were determined by dividing luciferase values by β-galactosidase values. All of the values shown are the means of three cultures ± S.E. Immunoblotting—Cultures were extracted in a lysis buffer composed of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin. After clearing by centrifugation, the protein concentration of the lysate was determined, and after dilution with the appropriate amount of 2× Laemmli buffer, equal amounts of protein from each sample were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were then probed with a GRP78 antiserum (sc-1050, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with a FLAG antiserum, M2 antibody (F-3165, Sigma), or with antisera raised against human ATF6α or human ATF6β (a gift from Dr. K. Mori). Pulse-Chase Labeling—HeLa cells were transfected with 30 μgofthe test expression vector as described above, and 3 × 106 cells were plated on 60-mm dishes. Following a 48-h incubation in serum-containing medium, the cells were rinsed three times with warm Hanks' buffer (Invitrogen) and incubated for 2 h with 250 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Easytag Express protein-labeling mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)) diluted in 2 ml of methionine/cysteine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Following a 2-h incubation, this medium was removed and the cultures were washed twice with DMEM and then incubated with 3 ml of chase medium (DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm unlabeled methionine, and 2 mm unlabeled cysteine). At the indicated times, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and then scraped into 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% SDS. The lysate was then diluted with 400 μl of lysis buffer without SDS to a final concentration of 0.02% SDS and then cleared by centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated 12–18 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of FLAG antiserum (F-3165, Sigma) followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads and elution with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated material was then resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% SDS gel) and dried down and exposed on a phosphorimaging screen. Small Interfering RNAs—Small interfering (si)RNA was generated using a kit (Dicer siRNA generation kit, catalog number T510001) from Gene Therapy Systems, Inc. (San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forward and reverse PCR primers were designed such that they would generate PCR products between 500 and 1,000 bp in length. For human ATF6α, the forward primer was 5′-GCCTTTATTGCTTCCAGCAG-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-TCTTCGCTTTGGACTAGGGAC-3′. For human ATF6β, the forward primer was 5′-CCGATCTTCCCAGATCTTCAG-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-CACCCTGGATGAGGACAACTG-3′. The ATF6 sequences in each primer were flanked on the 5′ ends with 20 nucleotides from the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Human ATF6α or β-cDNAs were used as the templates for PCR. After PCR, the products (586 bp for ATF6α; 622 bp for ATF6β) were used as templates for in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase, which resulted in the formation of dsRNA ATF6-related fragments. The resulting material was treated with DNase to remove the DNA template and RNase to remove any ssRNA. The resulting ATF6 dsRNA was then cleaved into small segments of RNA with the RNA Dicer enzyme and then transfected into HeLa cells using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunocytofluorescence—Following transfection with the appropriate siRNA, HeLa cells were incubated in 10% fetal calf serum for 48 h. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were fixed with 4% paraform-aldehyde, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100 in 1× TBST, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin/TBST for 45 min. For detection of endogenous ATF6α or β, cells were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. Anti-ATF6α and anti-ATF6β antisera were gifts from Dr. Kazutoshi Mori. ATF6 antiserum binding was visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antiserum (1:500, Jackson Immuno-Research, Baltimore, MD). To compare ATF6α and β-mediated ERSRG induction, we assessed the abilities of constructs encoding FLAG epitopetagged versions of the putatively active N-terminal fragments of each isoform (N-ATF6α and N-ATF6β) to induce a luciferase reporter under the control of an isolated ERSE derived from the GRP78 promoter (6Yoshida H.

Increasing the levels of the N-ATF6α construct in transfection experiments resulted in progressive increases in reporter expression as expected; however, the N-ATF6β construct appeared to have no effect on reporter activity, even at the highest concentration tested (Fig. 1A). Because reporter constructs regulated by isolated ERSE usually exhibit lower activity than native ERSE-containing promoters, we decided to examine the abilities of each construct to activate transcription from the native GRP78 promoter (6Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Again, as expected, increasing levels of the N-ATF6α construct conferred a progressive increase in reporter expression amounting to a maximum of 48-fold over control (Fig. 1B). However, only at the highest concentration tested did the N-ATF6β construct exhibit apparent reporter induction, which did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 1B). A similar trend was observed when the relative abilities of N-ATF6α and β to activate endogenous ERSRG expression were assessed. Although N-ATF6α conferred an approximate 4-fold increase in endogenous GRP78 protein levels, N-ATF6β conferred at most a 1.5-fold increase (Fig. 2, A and B).Fig. 2Effect of N-ATF6α or N-ATF6β on GRP78 expression levels. Panel A, Western blot (WB). HeLa cells were transfected with 10 μg of an empty vector control (None) or with plasmids encoding FLAG-N-ATF6α or FLAG-N-ATF6β. After 48 h, cultures were extracted and analyzed for GRP78 expression by Western blotting as described under “Materials and Methods.” Panel B, quantitation. The Western blots shown in Panel A were densitometrically analyzed. Values (mean densities ± S.E.) were determined from three cultures and normalized to maximum GRP78 expression level. * and † = p < 0.05, different from the empty vector control (None) as determined using ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the differences between N-ATF6α- and β-mediated reporter induction might be attributed to different transgene expression levels, FLAG immunoblot analyses were carried out. Surprisingly, at any given plasmid concentration, N-ATF6α, which was transcriptionally more active, was always expressed at very low levels, whereas N-ATF6β, which had essentially no transcriptional activity, was expressed at very high levels (Fig. 3A). Densitometric analyses demonstrated that at a given plasmid concentration, N-ATF6β was expressed at 10–15-fold higher levels than N-ATF6α (Fig. 3B). Based on the activity and expression results shown in Figs. 1 and 2, it was estimated that the specific transcriptional activity of N-ATF6α was approximately 200-fold greater than that of N-ATF6β. Our previous results showed that the expression levels and half-lives of various mutated forms of N-ATF6α were inversely related to their transcriptional activities, such that the higher the transcriptional activity, the lower the expression level and the shorter the half-life (10Thuerauf D.J. Morrison L.E. Hoover H. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20734-20739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because N-ATF6β exhibited low activity yet was expressed at high levels, we compared its half-life to that of N-ATF6α. The results of pulse-chase labeling experiments were consistent with this hypothesis showing that, after 3 h of chase incubation, >50% of the labeled N-ATF6α had disappeared (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 8), whereas very little of the labeled N-ATF6β had disappeared (Fig. 4A, lanes 15 and 16). Additional experiments showed that the half-lives of N-ATF6α and β were ∼2 and 5 h, respectively (Fig. 4B). Thus, the expression level and half-life of N-ATF6β mimic those of low activity N-ATF6α mutants. Because the ER forms of ATF6α and β are both cleaved in response to ER stress and because the N-terminal cleavage products both translocate to the nucleus and bind to ERSEs (13Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), we assessed the effects of co-expressing N-ATF6α and β on GRP78 promoter activation. As expected, N-ATF6β alone exhibited very low levels of GRP78 promoter activation (Fig. 5A, bar 4) compared with N-ATF6α alone (Fig. 5A, bar 5). However, N-ATF6β inhibited N-ATF6α-mediated GRP78 promoter activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A, bars 6–8). Thus, N-ATF6β exhibited a dominant-negative-like effect over N-ATF6α. Truncated forms of N-ATF6α and N-ATF6β that are missing the putative N-terminal TADs have been shown to have DN effects on ERSRG induction (8Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Haze K. Okada T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Because N-ATF6β appeared to behave similar to a DN, we compared its effects to N-ATF6α-DN and N-ATF6β-DN. In contrast to N-ATF6β, neither N-ATF6α-DN nor N-ATF6β-DN was able to elicit any measurable transcriptional activation of the GRP78 promoter on its own (Fig. 5B, bar 4, and C, bar 4). However, in comparison to N-ATF6β, both N-ATF6α-DN and N-ATF6β-DN effectively blocked N-ATF6α-mediated GRP78 promoter stimulation (Fig. 5B, bars 6–8, C, bars 6–8). Thus, compared with N-ATF6α, N-ATF6β exhibited a very low level of transcriptional activity and it acted in a dominant-interfering manner to repress N-ATF6α-mediated gene induction. The effects of ATF6α and β on ER stress induced by TN were also assessed. Cultures transfected with empty vector exhibited low basal GRP78 promoter activity that was stimulated by >20-fold by TN as expected (Fig. 6, Con). Cultures that were transfected with N-ATF6α exhibited robust GRP78 promoter activation that was increased further upon TN treatment, also as expected (Fig. 6, ATF6α). In the absence of TN, N-ATF6β conferred a very small induction of ERSRG. However, cultures transfected with N-ATF6β were unable to mount a full ER stress response following TN treatment, exhibiting 3–4-fold less GRP78 promoter activation than cultures transfected with empty vector (Fig. 6, ATF6β). Although neither N-ATF6α-DN nor N-ATF6β-DN alone exhibited activity, it effectively blocked TN-mediated GRP78 promoter induction (Fig. 6, ATF6α-DN and ATF6β-DN), as expected from their previous characterization as dominant-interfering proteins. Thus, N-ATF6β was an effective blocker of the endogenous ER stress-response machinery responsible for GRP78 promoter activation. To examine the roles of endogenous ATF6α and β, siRNAs directed against each ATF6 isoform were developed. Immunocytofluorescence showed that cultures transfected with a control siRNA directed against GFP exhibited robust ATF6α and β expression pattern consistent with localization to the rough ER and Golgi (Fig. 7, A and D). In contrast, cultures transfected with ATF6α siRNA exhibited considerably reduced ATF6α expression (Fig. 7, B versus A) but no effect on ATF6β expression (Fig. 7, E versus D). Moreover, cultures transfected with ATF6β siRNA showed no apparent effect on ATF6α expression (Fig. 7, C versus A) but reduced ATF6β expression (Fig. 7, F versus D). Immunoblot analyses were carried out to further assess the effects of the siRNA reagents on endogenous ATF6α and β. As expected, cultures that were transfected with GFP siRNA expressed the highest levels of endogenous ATF6α and β (Fig. 8A, lane 1, and B, lane 1). Cultures transfected with ATF6α siRNA exhibited an approximate 82% reduction in ATF6α expression 2The transfection efficiency in these experiments averaged 70–80%. Thus, because there was an 82% reduction in the level of ATF6α in the culture extract, the reduction of ATF6α in those cells that were transfected was essentially complete. (Fig. 8A, lane 2 versus 1) but no change in the levels of endogenous ATF6β (Fig. 8B, lane 2 versus 1). In contrast, cultures transfected with ATF6β siRNA exhibited a small 37% reduction in the level of endogenous ATF6α (Fig. 8A, lane 3 versus 1); however, they exhibited a 70% reduction in ATF6β expression (Fig. 8B, lane 3 versus 1). Finally, cultures transfected with both ATF6α and β siRNA exhibited an 84% reduction in ATF6α expression (Fig. 8A, lane 4) and a 70% reduction in ATF6β expression (Fig. 8B, lane 4). Thus, the siRNAs were ATF6 isoform-selective and effected significant reductions in the expression levels of endogenous ATF6α and β as assessed by immunocytofluorescence and immunoblotting. To examine the effects of knocking down endogenous ATF6α and/or β on the ER stress response, cultures were co-transfected with the various siRNAs and the GRP78 promoterdriven luciferase construct. When cultures were transfected with siRNA directed against GFP, they retained a robust ER stress response that was identical to cultures that did not receive siRNA (Fig. 9, compare None versus GFP) as expected. When cultures were transfected with ATF6α siRNA, they nearly completely lost the ability to respond to TN (Fig. 9, ATF6α), also as expected. However, cultures transfected with ATF6β siRNA actually exhibited an enhanced ER stress response (Fig. 9, ATF6β), consistent with the hypothesis that endogenous ATF6β is a transcriptional repressor of ATF6α. Lastly, cultures transfected with ATF6α and β siRNA exhibited a similar ER stress response as those transfected with ATF6α siRNA alone (Fig. 9, ATF6α + ATF6β). The fact that there was a residual response in cultures treated with either ATF6α siRNA alone or with ATF6α and ATF6β siRNA could be the result of an incomplete knock down of ATF6α. Alternatively, it could mean that a portion of the ER stress response is ATF6α-independent. Consistent with the latter possibility are studies suggesting that ERSRG induction can be mediated by the third member of the ATF6 family of b-ZIP proteins, XBP-1, which is also known to bind to ERSEs (15Clauss I.M.

Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study using fibroblasts from XBP-1 knock-out mice showed that XBP-1 is required for a full ER stress response (20Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Lastly, HeLa cells transfected with both ATF6α and XBP-1 siRNA exhibited no residual ER stress response as measured by TN-inducible GRP78 promoter-driven luciferase induction (data not shown). The results of this study show that, compared with ATF6α, ATF6β possesses very low specific transcriptional activity and, most likely by virtue of this characteristic, ATF6β can serve as a repressor of ATF6α-mediated ERSRG induction. In support of our findings that ATF6β exhibits low specific transcriptional activity is a recent gene array study that failed to identify a single gene induced by ATF6β (20Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Consistent with the repressor roles for ATF6β was our finding that knocking down ATF6β expression using siRNA actually increased TN-mediated ERSRG induction (Fig. 9). It is of interest to consider the consequences of these apparently opposing actions of ATF6α and β on the ER stress response. At least in part, the ratio of N-ATF6α/N-ATF6β must play a role in determining the magnitude and duration of the ATF6-dependent component of ERSRG induction. To a first approximation, the N-ATF6α/N-ATF6β ratio would be determined by the relative expression levels of the membrane forms of ATF6α and β and the relative rates of cleavage of these forms following the onset of ER stress. Although these parameters remain to be determined in detail, several published studies may provide some insight. Immunoblot analyses suggest that in HeLa cells the levels of the membrane forms of ATF6α and β are similar (12Haze K. Okada T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 13Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar); however, the rates of cleavage appear to differ. In response to TN, the cleavage of ATF6α was shown to be maximal after approximately 3–4 h, whereas the cleavage of ATF6β did not reach a maximum until 8 h after TN treatment (12Haze K. Okada T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, the relative expression levels and times of generation are consistent with the hypothesis that N-ATF6β is generated after N-ATF6α and that it serves as an endogenous modulator of ATF6α-mediated gene induction. Moreover, the half-lives of ATF6α and β are also consistent with the view that ATF6β, which is relatively long-lived, serves as an inhibitor of ATF6α, which is extremely short-lived (Fig. 4). Although the ATF6α/β ratio and the rates of cleavage of each isoform are consistent with the hypothesis that N-ATF6β is a transcriptional repressor, it remains unclear why a specific inhibitor of N-ATF6α-mediated gene induction is necessary. There are several other cases of transcription factor homologues that serve as repressors that ensure transient gene induction. For example, CREB and ICER are CREB/ATF family members that exert opposing effects on cAMP-dependent signaling (16Vinson C. Myakishev M. Acharya A. Mir A.A. Moll J.R. Bonovich M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6321-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The b-Zip and DNA binding domains of CREB and ICER are nearly identical; however, ICER does not possess a functional TAD. Accordingly, ICER, which is generated shortly after CREB activation, serves as a transcriptional repressor of CREB-mediated signaling and, by doing so, it ensures the transient activation of CREB-mediated gene induction. Thus, similar to CREB and ICER, perhaps ATF6α and β function together to ensure the transient activation of ATF6α-mediated gene induction during ER stress, and analogous to prolonged CREB activation, it may be that prolonged activation of ATF6α leads to effects that are not conducive to resolving the ER stress or promoting cell survival. Perhaps the inhibitory actions of ATF6β combined with the rapid rate at which N-ATF6α is degraded ensure that the effects of ATF6α are transient. Consistent with this possibility are previous studies showing that, in response to ER stress, ATF6α is activated rapidly but transiently (17Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2870) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that if the ATF6α-mediated events do not lead to resolution of the ER stress, there is a subsequent activation of XBP-1, which continues to induce some ER stress-response genes along with additional non-ATF6α-inducible genes such as EDEM, a protease that degrades misfolded proteins (21Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 22Mori K. Traffic. 2003; 4: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Many questions remain to be addressed regarding the roles of ATF6α and β during the ER stress response. Do ATF6α and β work in concert to finely tune the extent and magnitude of ATF6-mediated gene induction analogous to CREB and ICER? Are the rates of ATF6α and β generation and degradation regulated so they can be varied to suit the severity and nature of the ER stress? How do ATF6α and β collaborate with XBP1 to regulate the temporal induction of ER stress-response genes? Future studies on the rates of ATF6α and β cleavage in response to different stresses, as well as the mechanisms by which β exerts its inhibitory effects on α, will be necessary to provide answers to these provocative questions."

In pursuit of the function of phosducin, we tested the hypothesis that it regulates the light-driven translocation of G protein transducin from the outer segments of rod photoreceptors to other compartments of the rod cell. Transducin translocation has been previously shown to contribute to rod adaptation to bright illumination, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying the translocation phenomenon remain unknown. In this study we provide two major lines of evidence in support of the role of phosducin in transducin translocation. First, we have demonstrated that transducin βγ subunits interact with phosducin along their entire intracellular translocation route, as evident from their co-precipitation in serial tangential sections from light-adapted but not dark-adapted retinas. Second, we generated a phosducin knockout mouse and found that the degree of light-driven transducin translocation in the rods of these mice was significantly reduced as compared with that observed in the rods of wild type animals. In knockout animals the translocation of transducin βγ subunits was affected to a larger degree than the translocation of the α subunit. We also found that the amount of phosducin in rods is sufficient to interact with practically all of the transducin present in these cells and that the subcellular distribution of phosducin is consistent with that of a soluble protein evenly distributed throughout the entire rod cytoplasm. Together, these data indicate that phosducin binding to transducin βγ subunits facilitates transducin translocation. We suggest that the mechanism of phosducin action is based on the reduction of transducin affinity to the membranes of rod outer segments, achieved by keeping the transducin βγ subunits apart from the α subunit. This increased solubility of transducin would make it more susceptible to translocation from the outer segments.

Vertebrate photoreceptors are highly specialized neurons responsible for the reception and primary processing of visual information. The outer segment compartment of the photoreceptor contains large amounts of the proteins involved in light detection and in the generation of the visual signal (for review, see Refs. 1Pugh Jr., E.N.

Photons entering the outer segment are absorbed by rhodopsin, which triggers sequential activation of many molecules of the photoreceptor-specific heterotrimeric G protein, transducin. Transducin activation consists of GTP binding to its α subunit followed by dissociation of the α subunit from the transducin βγ subunits and the subsequent stimulation of the downstream effector, cGMP phosphodiesterase. Signaling persists until GTP is hydrolyzed and transducin subunits re-associate into a heterotrimer. In dark-adapted rods most of the transducin is located in the outer segments. However, prolonged exposures to bright light cause massive transducin translocation from rod outer segments to other subcellular compartments of the rod (5Brann M.R. Cohen L.V.

However, the molecular mechanisms that govern transducin translocation in rods remain to be elucidated. In this study we tested the hypothesis that phosducin, an abundant photoreceptor-specific protein that interacts with transducin βγ subunits in vitro (11Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N.

We have found that upon illumination, transducin βγ subunits interact with phosducin along the entire path of their light-driven translocation through the rod cell, but almost no interaction takes place in dark-adapted photoreceptors. We next generated a phosducin knockout mouse and found that the degree of transducin translocation in the rods of knockout mice was lower than in those of control mice. The effect of the knockout was most pronounced with the transducin βγ subunits, consistent with these subunits being the partner in transducin-phosducin interaction. Finally, we found that rods contain approximately as much phosducin as transducin and that phosducin is present in all subcellular compartments of the rod, consistent with the distribution of a soluble cytoplasmic protein. These data indicate that the interaction of phosducin with transducin βγ subunits facilitates transducin translocation in light-adapted rod photoreceptors.

Preparation of Plastic-embedded Cross-sections of the Retina—Eyes were enucleated, cleaned of outside tissue, and fixed for 1 h in freshly prepared 2% formaldehyde with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer containing 2.5 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4). The eye globe was then hemisected along the vertical meridian and allowed to fix overnight at the same buffer. The eyecup was rinsed with excess 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), placed into 2% osmium tetroxide for 1.5 h, and rinsed twice with water. The eye cup was gradually dehydrated in an increasing ethanol series (25-100%) and embedded in Epon. 1-μm cross-sections were obtained and stained with alkaline toluidine blue for light microscopy. Serial Sectioning with Western Blotting—This method was used as previously described (9Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Google Scholar) with several optimizations. A mouse or rat eye was enucleated and dissected in Ringer's solution containing 130 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 2.4 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.02 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) with the osmolarity adjusted to 313 mosmol. All tissue manipulations were conducted in Ringer's solution. The anterior portion of the eye was cut away, and the lens was removed. A 2-mm trephine (for mice) or 3-mm trephine (rats) was used to punch a central disc through the entire posterior eye cup. The retina was gently pulled away from the eyecup disc, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with the photoreceptors facing up, and positioned on a porous glass filter. The retina was flattened by applying gentle suction from underneath the glass filter, removing the entire solution from the flattening chamber. The retina, still attached to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, was then flat-mounted between two glass slides separated by 0.5-mm-thick spacers and frozen. The cover glass and the spacers were subsequently removed, and the retina was sectioned in a cryomicrotome. The alignment of the retina surface with the cutting plane of the microtome knife was performed as follows. Tissue freezing compound was applied to the specimen holder of the microtome and allowed to freeze. It was then sectioned through to create a flat surface large enough to accommodate the base slide holding the frozen retina. The base slide was then mounted to the freezing compound by the addition of water drops to the sides of the glass base. The retina was trimmed to remove any folded edges, and the remaining flat surface was cut in 5-μm serial sections. Each section was collected in a pre-cooled 0.5-ml Eppendorf tube and stored at -80 °C until used. Western blotting was performed using the Criterion™ system (Bio-Rad). Each frozen section was dissolved in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For each tested protein, 10-μl aliquots were separated on a 26-well 10-20% Tris-HCl gel for 1 h at 150 V. For rhodopsin detection, 50-fold diluted aliquots were used. The transfer to Immun-Blot™ polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) was carried out in Towbin buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 15% (v/v) methanol for 2 h at 0.2 A. Proteins of interest were probed with specific antibodies and visualized using either the SuperSignal® West Pico ECL detection system (Pierce) or the ECF detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For ECL analysis, the densities of immunostained bands were quantified using the Personal Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics) with ImageQuant software. In ECF analysis the fluorescence of the bands was quantified by using Storm 860 Gel and Blot Imaging System (Molecular Dynamics) equipped with the same software. We found that the ECL detection system was more sensitive than the ECF system but that ECF provided better linearity of the signal. For this reason, the ECF system was used in all quantitative experiments. Immunoprecipitation—Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against the transducin γ subunit were conjugated to protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) as follows. 200 μg of antibodies were bound to 0.5 ml of beads in 5 ml of PBS buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed twice with 10 ml of 0.2 m borate-NaOH buffer (pH 8.7) and resuspended in 5 ml of freshly prepared 1 mg/ml solution of the BS3 cross-linking reagent (Pierce) in the same buffer. Cross-linking was allowed to proceed for 30 min with constant shaking at room temperature. To neutralize the remaining cross-linker, beads were washed with 10 ml of 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and left in the same buffer for 2 h. Non-covalently bound antibodies were removed from the beads by a 3-min wash containing 10 ml of 0.2 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.5) followed by repeated PBS washes until the pH of the suspension reached 7.4. Beads were stored in PBS buffer containing 0.1% NaN3 at 4 °C until used. 10-μm-thick sections from rat retinas were obtained as described above and thawed in 0.1 ml of the PBS buffer supplemented with 1.85% IGEPAL CA-630 (formerly known as the Nonidet P-40 detergent), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm Microcystine LR (all from Sigma). Samples were vortexed, and insoluble material was precipitated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 3 min. 50-μl aliquots of the supernatants were incubated with 20 μl of beads in Handee™ Mini-Spin Columns (Pierce) with constant shaking for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were washed three times for 3 min with 200 μl of the same buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Light Adaptation of Animals and Determination of Rhodopsin Bleaching Levels—Before light exposure, animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine/xylazine mixture (75/20 and 50/50 mg/kg for rats and mice, respectively) and the pupils were dilated with a mixture of 1% cyclopentolate-HCl, 2.5% phenylephrine, and 0.25% tropicamide. To prevent cataract formation in anesthetized animals, Gonak™ (Akorn) was applied on the cornea several times during the course of light exposure. Light was delivered to the eyes by fiber-optic guides from an adjustable light source equipped with a 100-W halogen bulb. Even illumination throughout the entire retina was achieved by positioning a white screen between the light guide and the eye, just above the cornea. The light intensity on the eye surface was measured by a calibrated photodiode in which the spectral sensitivity closely matched that of rhodopsin. The photodiode was attached to PDA-700 amplifier (TTI Inc., Oriskany, NY). Mice were typically subjected to a 30-min exposure at 38 scotopic candela m-2, which resulted in the bleaching of ∼25% rhodopsin in their retinas. In some experiments we used the luminance of 400 scotopic candela m-2, resulting in the bleaching or more than 90% rhodopsin. The experimental protocol for rats included a 1-h light exposure at 200 scotopic candela m-2, resulting in the bleaching of 80% rhodopsin. Rhodopsin concentration was determined by difference spectroscopy using the molar extinction coefficient of 40,500 (16Bownds D. Gordon-Walker A. Gaide-Huguenin A.-C. Robinson W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1971; 58: 225-237Google Scholar). The degree of rhodopsin bleaching in the retinas of light-adapted animals was determined by measuring the amount of rhodopsin before and after its regeneration with 11-cis-retinal. A protocol modified from (9Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Google Scholar) was used as follows. A single retina was extracted from an eye under dim red illumination and sonicated in 250 μl of water. A 100-μl aliquot was mixed with 20 μl of 200 mm hydroxylamine (titrated to pH 7.5 by NaOH) containing 10% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. The sample was centrifuged in a tabletop microcentrifuge, and rhodopsin concentration in the supernatant was measured by difference spectrometry. The rest of the sonicated sample was mixed with 0.5 μl of 4 mm 11-cis-retinal solubilized in ethanol, sonicated again, and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min in complete darkness. Upon the completion of regeneration, rhodopsin concentration was determined in a 100-μl aliquot, as in the non-regenerated sample. The extent of rhodopsin bleaching in the retina was calculated as the difference between the measured rhodopsin concentration in regenerated and non-regenerated samples. Generation of the Phosducin Knockout Mouse—The phosducin knockout mouse was generated by inGenious Targeting Laboratory (Stony Brook, NY) on a commercial basis. The phosducin gene was cloned from a 129Sv genomic library (Stratagene) and was used to construct a targeting vector containing the neomycin resistance gene flanked by two genomic fragments spanning the phosducin gene promoter and Exon 1 regions (17Abe T. Kikuchi T. Chang T. Shinohara T. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 179-186Google Scholar). The long fragment of the targeting construct was a 5.5-kilobase long sequence between second and first EcoRV restriction sites upstream from Exon 1. The short fragment of the targeting construct was a 1.0-kilobase-long sequence downstream of Exon 1, from 5′-TTTTAAAGAAATTTGTCTTGTAGG-3′ to 5′-TTCCAGCACATATTGTTTAATTCTG-3′. The targeted allele contained a deletion of phosducin gene promoter, and Exon 1. IT2 embryonic stem cells were transfected with the targeting vector and incubated in media containing G418. Surviving colonies were analyzed by PCR analysis to identify homologous recombinants. One correctly targeted embryonic stem cell clone was microinjected into C57BL/6J host blastocysts to generate chimeric mice, which were bred with C57BL/6J mice to obtain heterozygous offspring. Homozygous knockout animals and wild type littermates were obtained by sibling mating among the heterozygotes. Mouse genotyping was performed with genomic DNA isolated from tail tips using the PUREGENE™ DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems). The wild type phosducin allele was identified by PCR using primers a (5′-TTCAAAGGAGTTCAGTGGACAG) and b (5′-TTCCAGCACATATTGTTTAATTCTG), which amplified a 1-kilobase product. The knockout allele was identified by PCR using primers c (5′-TGCGAGGCCAGAGGCCACTTGTGTAGC) and d (5′-TATTCATCAGCCTGTATTATCAGCAC), which amplified a 1.3-kilobase product-containing fragment of the neomycin resistance cassette. It should be mentioned that a possibility for the existence of two phosducin genes was previously discussed (17Abe T. Kikuchi T. Chang T. Shinohara T. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 179-186Google Scholar); however, this is essentially ruled out by the presence of only one such a gene in both human and mouse genomes. Electroretinographic (ERG) Measurements—ERGs were recorded simultaneously from both eyes using the Espion electrophysiology system (Diagnosys LCC, Littleton, MA) according to published methods (18Lyubarsky A.L. Falsini B. Pennesi M.E. Valentini P. Pugh Jr., E.N. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 442-455Google Scholar). In brief, dark-adapted mice were anesthetized, and their pupils were dilated with a mixture of 1% cyclopentolate-HCl, 2.5% phenylephrine, and 0.25% tropicamide. The recording electrodes were silver wires enclosed inside plastic armatures terminated with white contact lenses completely covering the mouse pupil. Electrical contact between the cornea and the electrode was achieved through Gonak™ (Akorn) that also protected the eyes from drying during the experiment. The reference electrode was a silver wire covered with cotton wetted in a 0.9% NaCl solution placed in the mouth. Mouse body temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a homeothermic blanket connected to its control unit (Harvard Apparatus). To calculate the number of photoisomerizations, Φ, produced by test flashes of various light intensity we measured directly the amount of rhodopsin bleaching caused by a series of flashes of the maximal intensity and corrected the bleaching level for each flash intensity used. The total number of rhodopsin molecules present in a mouse rod outer segment was taken as 108 (1Pugh Jr., E.N. Lamb T.D. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh Jr., E.N. Handbook of Biological Physics: Molecular Mechanisms in Visual Transduction. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam2000: 183-255Google Scholar). Subcellular Distribution of Phosducin in Rat Rods—Crucial for elucidating phosducin function is the knowledge of its sub-cellular localization in rods. The published data on phosducin subcellular distribution, all obtained using the immunohistochemical technique, are rather controversial. Most of the early studies attributed phosducin as a rod outer segment protein (11Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1972-1977Google Scholar, 12Lee R.H. Lieberman B.S. Lolley R.N. Biochemistry. 1987; 28: 3983-3990Google Scholar). The subsequent studies indicated that the majority of phosducin is localized in rod inner segments (19Lee R.H. Whelan J.P. Lolley R.N. McGinnis J.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 46: 829-840Google Scholar, 20Gropp K.E. Huang J.C. Aguirre G.D. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 64: 875-886Google Scholar, 21Thulin C.D. Howes K. Driscoll C.D. Savage J.R. Rand T.A. Baehr W. Willardson B.M. Mol. Vis. 1999; 5: 40Google Scholar) or that phosducin is found most abundantly near the rod synapse (22Nakano K. Chen J. Tarr G.E. Yoshida T. Flynn J.M. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4693-4698Google Scholar). This issue is further complicated by two reports that phosducin moves from rod outer segments to rod inner segments upon illumination (7Whelan J.P. McGinnis J.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 20: 263-270Google Scholar, 23Kuo C.-H. Miki N. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 103: 8-10Google Scholar), although this effect has not been confirmed by others (22Nakano K. Chen J. Tarr G.E. Yoshida T. Flynn J.M. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4693-4698Google Scholar). Our own analysis of rat retina cross-sections stained with anti-phosducin antibodies (Fig. 1) also revealed phosducin immunostaining to be most intense in the synaptic region, with slightly less staining in the inner segments, almost no staining in the outer segments, and no difference in the staining patterns of retinas obtained from dark- or light-adapted rats. We believe that the major source of these discrepancies is likely to be the non-quantitative nature of immunohistochemistry. This technique relies on the efficiency of antigen-antibody recognition that can differ in different cellular compartments and could yield different results with different antibodies used or different tissue fixation methods applied (cf. Ref. 24Roof D.J. Heth C.A. Science. 1988; 241: 845-847Google Scholar). To overcome the limitations of the immunohistochemical approach, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of phosducin by the novel technique combining serial tangential sectioning of flat-mounted frozen retinas with the Western blot analysis of proteins of interest in each section (9Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Google Scholar). In this approach, the subcellular localization of proteins of interest in the rod is determined by comparing its distribution in the sections with the distribution of protein markers confined to specific subcellular compartments. Because Western blotting is based on the analysis of proteins completely unfolded by SDS, detached from their interacting partners, and separated according to their size, this approach does not suffer from the problem of epitope masking and permits quantitative analysis of individual protein bands regardless of antibody cross-reactivity with other protein bands on the same blot. Because cones comprise only ∼3% of the total photoreceptor pool in the rodent retina (25Carter-Dawson L.D. LaVail M.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1979; 188: 245-262Google Scholar) and they are smaller than rods, we considered that essentially all detectable phosducin in this analysis originates from rods. A representative experiment using the serial sectioning/Western blotting technique is shown in Fig. 2. We compared the distribution of phosducin throughout the serial sections obtained from the retina of a dark-adapted rat with the distribution of three marker proteins, rhodopsin (rod outer segment marker), cytochrome c (mitochondrial marker located mostly in the ellipsoid part of the inner segment and near synaptic terminal), and synaptophysin (a marker for pre-synaptic membrane vesicles located between the rod nucleus and synaptic terminal). Our data indicate that phosducin is present in all sections from the photoreceptor layer, with some enrichment in the sections corresponding to the rod inner segment. This distribution is consistent with phosducin being a soluble protein present throughout the entire volume of rod cytoplasm. No phosducin immunostaining was found in any other section of the retina beyond the photoreceptor layer (data not shown), consistent with immunohistochemical data obtained by others (19Lee R.H. Whelan J.P. Lolley R.N. McGinnis J.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 46: 829-840Google Scholar, 21Thulin C.D. Howes K. Driscoll C.D. Savage J.R. Rand T.A. Baehr W. Willardson B.M. Mol. Vis. 1999; 5: 40Google Scholar, 22Nakano K. Chen J. Tarr G.E. Yoshida T. Flynn J.M. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4693-4698Google Scholar) and us (Fig. 1). To calculate the fraction of phosducin present in rod outer segments we used the approach originally developed for calculating the outer segment fraction of transducin (9Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Google Scholar). We first measured the density of the immunostained phosducin band in each section and plotted it as the percent of the total density of all bands (Fig. 3). We next identified those outer segment (rhodopsin-containing) sections that were not contaminated by the inner segment, as judged by the absence of cytochrome c. We then determined the fractions of phosducin and rhodopsin present in these sections and calculated the phosducin amount in the entire outer segment by taking their ratio. Based on such an analysis conducted with 5 dark-adapted rats we determined that the rod outer segment contains 12.5 ± 2.7% (S.E.) of the total phosducin present in the rods. No evidence of light-dependent phosducin re-distribution throughout the cell was obtained by the analysis of six rats subjected to light exposures saturating for transducin translocation (see Fig. 3 for a representative experiment). The outer segment content of phosducin in this case was 13.0 ± 2.2% of the total. Phosducin Quantification in Rat Rods—In the next series of experiments we measured phosducin content in rat rods based on the consideration that the amount of phosducin in rods is practically equal to its total amount in the retina. This is because phosducin is present exclusively in rods, and cones and rods constitute over 97% of all photoreceptors in the rat retina (25Carter-Dawson L.D. LaVail M.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1979; 188: 245-262Google Scholar). Retinas were extracted from dark-adapted rats under dim red illumination and disrupted by sonication in water. One aliquot was used to determine phosducin concentration by quantitative Western blotting using a calibration curve obtained with a set of recombinant rat phosducin standards (Fig. 4). Phosducin co"
https://openalex.org/W2000263382,"The activation of plasmin from its circulating precursor plasminogen is the mechanism of several clot-busting drugs used to clinically treat patients who have suffered a stroke; however, plasmin thus generated has been shown to activate platelets directly. There has been speculation as to whether plasmin interacts with the protease-activated receptors (PARs) because of its similarity in amino acid specificity with the classic platelet activator thrombin. We have investigated whether plasmin activates platelets via PAR activation through multiple complementary approaches. At concentrations sufficient to induce human platelet aggregation, plasmin released very little calcium compared with that induced by thrombin, the PAR-1 agonist peptide SFLLRN, or the PAR-4 agonist peptide AYPGKF. Stimulation of platelets with plasmin initially failed to desensitize additional stimulation with SFLLRN or AYPGKF, but a prolonged incubation with plasmin desensitized platelets to further stimulation by thrombin. The desensitization of PAR-1 had no effect on plasmin-induced platelet aggregation and yielded an aggregation profile that was similar to plasmin in response to a low dose of thrombin. However, PAR-4 desensitization completely eliminated aggregation in response to plasmin. Inclusion of the PAR-1-specific antagonist BMS-200261 inhibited platelet aggregation induced by a low dose of thrombin but not by plasmin. Additionally, mouse platelets naturally devoid of PAR-1 showed a full aggregation response to plasmin in comparison to thrombin. Furthermore, human and mouse platelets treated with a PAR-4 antagonist, as well as platelets isolated from PAR-4 homozygous null mice, failed to aggregate in response to plasmin. Finally, a protease-resistant recombinant PAR-4 was refractory to activation by plasmin. We conclude that plasmin induces platelet aggregation primarily through slow cleavage of PAR-4.

Platelet activation performs a significant function in hemostasis and thrombosis. Platelets mediate hemostasis by amplifying an initial stimulus and aggregating at a site of injury. The stimulus can range from the exposure of subendothelial proteins, as in the case of tissue injury, to the development of turbulent blood flow through a narrowed blood vessel as in atherosclerosis. In the treatment of stroke or deep vein thrombus formation, the systemic administration of thrombolytic drugs, such as tissue plasminogen activator or streptokinase, has been the most successful and widely used (1Schweizer J. Kirch W. Koch R. Elix H. Hellner G. Forkmann L. Graf A. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2000; 36: 1336-1343Google Scholar). Thrombolytic drugs work by catalyzing the activation of plasmin (an enzyme that degrades fibrin clots) from its inactive circulating precursor plasminogen from plasma. An interesting paradox is that plasmin also has the ability to directly activate platelets (2Niewiarowski S. Senyi A.F. Gillies P. J. Clin. Investig. 1973; 52: 1647-1659Google Scholar, 3Ishii-Watabe A. Uchida E. Mizuguchi H. Hayakawa T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1345-1355Google Scholar) and potentially cause additional thrombus formation. An important agonist for platelet activation is thrombin, which is generated at sites of vascular injury by extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation cascades. Thrombin induces its platelet-activating effects mainly through a family of G protein-coupled protease-activated receptors (PARs) 1The abbreviation used is: PAR, protease-activated receptor. 1The abbreviation used is: PAR, protease-activated receptor.; these receptors are activated by a mechanism in which a protease creates a new amino terminus that functions as its own tethered ligand and thus results in intramolecular activation (4Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Google Scholar, 5Hollenberg M.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 271-273Google Scholar). Of the four known PARs, three (PAR-1, PAR-3 and PAR-4) are activated by thrombin. PAR-1 is present in human platelets and plays a chief role in platelet activation because of its high affinity for thrombin, but it is absent in mouse platelets (6Kahn M.L. Hammes S.R. Botka C. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23290-23296Google Scholar). PAR-2 functions as a receptor for the protease trypsin but not for thrombin (7Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Google Scholar). PAR-4 is present in both human and mouse platelets, and it has a low affinity for thrombin (6Kahn M.L. Hammes S.R. Botka C. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23290-23296Google Scholar, 8Xu W.F. Andersen H. Whitmore T.E. Presnell S.R. Yee D.P. Ching A. Gilbert T. Davie E.W. Foster D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6642-6646Google Scholar). PAR-3 is present on mouse platelets and serves as a cofactor for PAR-4 activation at low thrombin concentrations but is absent from human platelets (9Ishihara H. Connolly A.J. Zeng D. Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Timmons C. Tram T. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1997; 386: 502-506Google Scholar, 10Nakanishi-Matsui M. Zheng Y.W. Sulciner D.J. Weiss E.J. Ludeman M.J. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 609-613Google Scholar). Thus, PAR-1 and PAR-4 mediate thrombin activation of human platelets, whereas PAR-3 and PAR-4 perform the same function in mouse platelets. PARs can be activated without proteolysis by the use of specific agonist peptides that mimic the tethered ligand regions of the respective receptors. The hexapeptide SFLLRN specifically activates PAR-1 in human platelets to cause aggregation (11Hung D.T. Wong Y.H. Vu T.K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20831-20834Google Scholar, 12Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Google Scholar), whereas the peptide AYPGKF activates PAR-4 in both human and mouse platelets (13Faruqi T.R. Weiss E.J. Shapiro M.J. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19728-19734Google Scholar). Plasmin, as a protease, has an amino acid specificity similar to thrombin in that it cleaves its substrates at lysine and arginine residues. Because plasmin and thrombin are both plasma proteases and thrombin interacts with PAR-1 and PAR-4 in human platelets, the possibility was presented that plasmin might also activate platelets by interacting with PAR-1 and/or PAR-4. Because it is not known which receptor mediates platelet activation by plasmin, it should not be surprising that little is known about the intracellular signaling pathways directly downstream of receptor activation. Platelet degranulation and secretion seem to play a large part in plasmin-mediated aggregation, particularly the potentiation of the effects of plasmin by ADP and epinephrine (3Ishii-Watabe A. Uchida E. Mizuguchi H. Hayakawa T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1345-1355Google Scholar). Some investigators have shown that relatively lengthy incubations of washed platelets with low doses of plasmin can inhibit thrombin-mediated aggregation (14Schafer A.I. Zavoico G.B. Loscalzo J. Maas A.K. Blood. 1987; 69: 1504-1507Google Scholar), whereas others have demonstrated that prolonged incubation with low plasmin concentrations stimulates significant platelet aggregation (15Ervin A.L. Peerschke E.I. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 2001; 12: 415-425Google Scholar). In this study, we report that plasmin is capable of inducing platelet activation through cleavage of protease-activated receptor 4. Reagents—Plasminogen, streptokinase, and the chromogenic plasmin substrate S-2403 were purchased from DiaPharma (West Chester, OH). The PAR-1 antagonist BMS-200261 was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Steven Seiler (Bristol-Myers Squibb). The PAR-1 activating peptide agonist SFLLRN, PAR-4 activating peptide agonist AYPGKF, and PAR-4 antagonist transcinnamoyl-YPGKF were synthesized by ResGen (Huntsville, AL). The thromboxane A2 analog 15(S)-hydroxy-9,11-epoxymethanoprosta-5Z,13E-dienoic acid (U44419) was purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Wild-type 129P3/J mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). PAR-4 homozygous null mice have been previously characterized (16Sambrano G.R. Weiss E.J. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2001; 413: 74-78Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Dr. Shaun Coughlin (Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA). COS-7 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). SC-57101 was obtained from Searle Research and Development (Skokie, IL). Fura-2 was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). PCR amplification kit was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (Cedar Creek, TX). Unless specifically mentioned, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Platelet Isolation—Whole human blood was drawn from informed, healthy volunteers at the Sol Sherry Thrombosis Research Center of Temple University. Whole mouse blood was drawn from mice by the heart puncture method. Human and mouse platelets were treated with aspirin, suspended in platelet-rich plasma, then isolated and resuspended in Tyrode's buffer as described previously (17Paul B.Z. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28293-28300Google Scholar). Plasmin Preparation—Plasmin was prepared by incubating 5 mg/ml plasminogen with 1.5 × 104 units/ml streptokinase for 3 min at 37 °C before addition as an agonist. The activities of plasmin preparations were assayed before each experiment; one plasmin activity unit was defined as the cleavage of 1 μmol of S-2403 per min. Intracellular Calcium Release—For platelet measurements, PRP was incubated with 2 μm fura-2 or an equal amount of Me2SO (vehicle) and incubated simultaneously with acetylsalicylic acid. Platelets were then isolated and washed as described above. The integrin αIIbβ3 antagonist SC-57101 (10 μm) was added before each assay to prevent agonist-mediated platelet aggregation from interfering with fluorescence measurement. Changes in fluorescence were measured using an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer with a water-jacketed cuvette holder, equipped with a thermostat, at 37 °C and set at constant stirring. Sample volumes of 0.5 ml were analyzed with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm. Fluorescence measurements were converted to calcium concentrations using the equation reported by Grynkiewicz et al. (18Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar), where Fmin and Fmax were determined with each respective platelet preparation. Platelet Aggregation—Agonist-induced platelet aggregation was analyzed using a Chrono-Log model 440-VS aggregometer (Havertown, PA) with sample volumes of 0.5 ml in a cuvette holder, equipped with a thermostat, at 37 °C and set at constant stirring. Aggregometer output was recorded using a Kipp & Zonen type BD 12E flatbed chart recorder (SCI-TEC, Saskatoon, Canada) set at 0.2 mm/s. Platelet Desensitization—Platelet desensitization was performed according to the method of Dubois et al. (19Dubois C. Steiner B. Kieffer N. Meyer Reigner S.C. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 89: 853-865Google Scholar), where washed platelets were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C without stirring in the absence or presence of either 50 μm SFLLRN, 500 μm AYPGKF, or 1 unit/ml plasmin. Immediately after incubation, platelets were assayed for their responses to various agonists. Construction of Wild-type and Mutant PAR-4 Expression Plasmids— PCR amplification of the wild-type PAR-4 coding sequence was carried out using forward and reverse primers specific for human PAR-4 cDNA (GenBank accession no. AF055917) (8Xu W.F. Andersen H. Whitmore T.E. Presnell S.R. Yee D.P. Ching A. Gilbert T. Davie E.W. Foster D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6642-6646Google Scholar). A sequence encoding a hemagglutinin epitope tag was inserted at the beginning of the translation initiation. The sense primer containing a HindIII restriction site and the hemagglutinin tag sequence is 5′-CGCGAAGCTTACCATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTTGGGGGCGACTGCTCCTGT-3′, and the antisense primer containing a XhoI restriction site is 5′-CGCTCGAGTCACTGGAGCAAAGAGGAGT-3′. The restriction enzyme sites are underlined, and the coding sequence of the hemagglutinin epitope is given in bold letters. After initial denaturation for 5 min at 95 °C, the PCR amplifications were carried out for 35 cycles using a 2× PCR mixture as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The final cycle was followed by an additional extension for 10 min at 72 °C. An expression plasmid (pcDNA3/PAR4) was constructed in the pcDNA3-Hygro (+) vector by digesting the reverse transcription-PCR product with Hind-IIII and XhoI and inserting into the vector digested with the same set of restriction enzymes. The nucleotide sequence of the wild-type PAR-4 cDNA in the expression plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. For the mutant PAR-4, a site-directed mutation at arginine-47 (R47A) was introduced into pcDNA3/PAR4 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Cedar Creek, TX) with changes in oligonucleotides from CGC to GCC. The sense primer sequence is 5′-GCCTGCCCCCGCCGGCTACCCAGGC-3′ and antisense primer is 5′-GCCTGGGTAGCCGGCGGGGGCAGGC-3′; the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient transfection of COS-7 cells was accomplished using the LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Cross-desensitization of PARs by Plasmin—Fig. 1 shows a typical human platelet aggregation tracing in response to 1 unit/ml plasmin, which can be totally blocked by inhibiting plasmin with the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. It should be noted that neither plasminogen nor its activator streptokinase are able to stimulate platelet aggregation on its own (Fig. 1). To begin investigating the identity of receptors with which plasmin may interact, we considered the protease-activated receptors present on human platelets, PAR-1 and PAR-4. PARs use G proteins in their signaling pathways, rendering PAR signaling subject to the phenomenon of desensitization (i.e. a decrease in the ability of a receptor to respond to further agonist stimulation). Thus, in approaching the question of whether plasmin cleaves PAR-1 or PAR-4, we examined the intracellular calcium release profile generated by plasmin in platelets by reasoning that if plasmin cleaved either PAR, then it may desensitize calcium release to further agonist stimulation of that PAR. Using plasmin as an agonist, we observed a slow net increase in intracellular calcium to ∼100 nm, followed by an equally slow decrease over time (Fig. 2A, ii and iv, first peak); these results are consistent with what has been previously reported for plasmin-mediated intracellular calcium release (20Nakamura K. Kimura M. Fenton 2nd, J.W. Andersen T.T. Aviv A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C958-C967Google Scholar, 21Turner J.S. Redpath G.T. Humphries J.E. Gonias S.L. Vandenberg S.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 175-179Google Scholar). When SFLLRN was added subsequent to plasmin addition, the level of intracellular calcium increased to a comparable extent as seen with SFLLRN alone (compare Fig. 2A, i and ii); a similar situation was observed when AYPGKF was the secondary stimulator (Fig. 2A, iii and iv).Fig. 2Plasmin desensitizes PAR-1 or PAR-4 after long incubation periods. A, intracellular calcium release tracings upon stimulation with the PAR-1 agonist SFLLRN (50 μm) added alone (i) or within 4 min after the addition of 1 unit/ml plasmin (ii), whereas the PAR-4 agonist AYPGKF (500 μm) was added alone (iii) or within 4 min after the addition of plasmin (iv). B, washed human platelets were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min in the absence (control) or presence of 1 unit/ml plasmin, followed by stimulation with 1 unit/ml thrombin (arrows) to initiate aggregation (top) or intracellular calcium mobilization (bottom). Tracings are representative of at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Platelet aggregation mediated by plasmin showed a greater extent and duration of shape change and a slower rate of aggregation onset compared with thrombin. If plasmin proteolysis proceeded at a slow rate relative to thrombin, then it could explain why a relatively short incubation time failed to desensitize further PAR stimulation. Therefore, in an effort to facilitate a greater extent of desensitization, platelets were incubated with plasmin for a prolonged period using a recently published protocol (19Dubois C. Steiner B. Kieffer N. Meyer Reigner S.C. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 89: 853-865Google Scholar). Upon further stimulation with 1 unit/ml thrombin, a complete loss of both aggregation and calcium release occurred relative to control treatment (Fig. 2B). Role of PARs in Plasmin-induced Platelet Aggregation—As an alternate approach to our hypothesis, we proceeded to determine whether desensitization of either PAR with the respective activating peptide would have an effect on platelet aggregation and calcium release induced by plasmin. Fig. 3 shows that in comparison with nondesensitized platelets, desensitization of PAR-1 with SFLLRN has no real effect on plasmin-mediated aggregation; however, when PAR-4 is desensitized with AYPGKF, aggregation induced by plasmin is completely eliminated. To more directly ascertain whether there was a functional consequence to activation of either PAR-1 or PAR-4 by plasmin, we examined the effect of plasmin on platelet aggregation in conditions where PAR-1 was either inhibited by treatment of human platelets with the PAR-1-specific antagonist BMS-200261 (22Bernatowicz M.S. Klimas C.E. Hartl K.S. Peluso M. Allegretto N.J. Seiler S.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 4879-4887Google Scholar) or absent as with mouse platelets. Using human platelets, thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation in the presence of BMS-200261 was abolished in reference to untreated platelet controls, but plasmin-mediated aggregation occurred without any apparent diminution (Fig. 4A). Plasmin stimulation of mouse platelets was also performed because mouse platelets contain PAR-3 and PAR-4 but not PAR-1. Our results show that mouse platelets aggregate in response to plasmin but not SFLLRN (Fig. 4B). PAR-4 Mediates Platelet Aggregation by Plasmin—To investigate the implicated involvement of PAR-4, we employed the use of a PAR-4 antagonist (tc-YPGKF) that was reported in the investigation of PAR-4-mediated activation of rat platelets (23Hollenberg M.D. Saifeddine M. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2001; 79: 439-442Google Scholar). Upon testing of human platelets, a plot of aggregation response versus differing concentrations of AYPGKF showed a clear shift to the right in the presence of tc-YPGKF relative to the absence of the inhibitor (Fig. 5A). In response to plasmin, the presence of tc-YPGKF also inhibited platelet aggregation without inhibiting shape change (Fig. 5B). It should be noted that plasmin activity assays in the absence and presence of tc-YPGKF show that the antagonist itself does not inhibit plasmin activity directly (data not shown). To further identify PAR-4 as the receptor involved in plasmin-mediated platelet aggregation, we performed aggregation studies with mouse platelets under circumstances in which a functional absence of PAR-4 occurred. Platelets from mice were treated with tc-YPGKF at the same concentration that was found to inhibit plasmin-mediated aggregation in human platelets. The mouse platelets responded in the same manner as human platelets; i.e. aggregation was inhibited but shape change still occurred (Fig. 6A). In addition, we obtained PAR-4-null mice and tested their platelets' response to plasmin. Our results show that PAR-4-null mouse platelets did not display any measurable shape change or aggregatory response to plasmin but demonstrated aggregation in response to a non-PAR agonist, such as the thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619 (Fig. 6B). Plasmin Cleaves PAR-4 at the Thrombin Cleavage Site—In an effort to show conclusively that plasmin cleaves PAR-4 at its tethered ligand generation site, an expression plasmid for PAR-4 was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells in which the cleavage residue, arginine-47, was unchanged (wild-type) or was mutated to an alanine (R47A) to confer resistance to proteolytic cleavage. When challenged with either thrombin or plasmin, those cells expressing the wild-type PAR-4 showed an increased extent of intracellular calcium mobilization over basal levels (Fig. 7). Moreover, a difference in the rates of calcium release mediated by the two proteases was readily observed and was calculated that the thrombin-mediated calcium release was ∼10-fold higher than that mediated by plasmin (Fig. 7A). In contrast, the mutated PAR-4 showed no response to either thrombin or plasmin, indicating that plasmin cleaves PAR-4 at the same site, as does thrombin (i.e. R47). It should be noted that functional PAR-4 signaling was established in both wild-type and mutated forms of the receptor by showing that the PAR-4 agonist peptide AYPGKF was capable of activating PAR-4 in the respectively transfected cells (Fig. 7B). Thrombolytic drugs that catalyze the formation of active plasmin can cause the level of plasmin to reach up to 1 unit/ml of blood (24Pasche B. Ouimet H. Francis S. Loscalzo J. Blood. 1994; 83: 404-414Google Scholar), and the ability of plasmin to activate platelets involves proteolysis, because treatment with the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride totally abolishes platelet shape change and aggregation (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the lack of a functional platelet response with inactivated plasmin rules out the idea of simple binding between plasmin and a platelet membrane protein to manifest an effect. In this study, we demonstrate that plasmin activates platelets via PAR-4 using multiple complementary approaches. It is given that human platelets express both PAR-1 and PAR-4 on their membrane surfaces and that our data show plasmin-mediated platelet aggregation continued during desensitization of PAR-1 (Fig. 3) and in the presence of a PAR-1 antagonist (BMS-200261). In addition, plasmin was unable to cause aggregation in PAR-4 desensitized platelets (Fig. 3), PAR-4-antagonized platelets (Fig. 5), or platelets from PAR-4-deficient mice (Fig. 6), and plasmin-mediated intracellular signaling ceased where PAR-4 had been rendered resistant to protease cleavage (Fig. 7). It has been reported that plasmin interacts with PAR-1 based on its activity toward a synthetic peptide designed to represent the thrombin cleavage site (25Parry M.A. Myles T. Tschopp J. Stone S.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 335-341Google Scholar), albeit with an activity that is slower than thrombin by about 10-fold. Kuliopulos et al. (26Kuliopulos A. Covic L. Seeley S.K. Sheridan P.J. Helin J. Costello C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4572-4585Google Scholar) showed with calcium mobilization studies that plasmin has a low affinity for the traditional thrombin cleavage site on PAR-1 and a higher affinity for a cleavage site that is further downstream; in effect, plasmin is more likely to make PAR-1 refractory to further thrombin stimulation than to stimulate calcium mobilization. In addition, platelets stimulated with plasmin after a short period failed to desensitize calcium mobilization to further simulation with SFLLRN (26Kuliopulos A. Covic L. Seeley S.K. Sheridan P.J. Helin J. Costello C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4572-4585Google Scholar), and these observations were validated in our laboratory (data not shown). Furthermore, our results explain the contradiction of previous reports concerning the ability of plasmin to inhibit thrombin- and SFLLRN-induced calcium mobilization in platelets (20Nakamura K. Kimura M. Fenton 2nd, J.W. Andersen T.T. Aviv A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C958-C967Google Scholar, 21Turner J.S. Redpath G.T. Humphries J.E. Gonias S.L. Vandenberg S.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 175-179Google Scholar). The inability of past investigators to observe plasmin-mediated aggregation most likely reflects the fact that prolonged plasmin activity leads to desensitization of PARs and resulting in diminished responses. Concerning the inability of plasmin to initially desensitize PAR-4 (Fig. 2A), we considered three possibilities: 1) that plasmin cleaves only a finite subset of the total number of PAR-4 molecules on the platelet surface and thus leaves a majority of naive receptors to interact with the stronger agonists; 2) that plasmin cleaves PAR-4 at a site other than the thrombin cleavage site and results in aberrant G protein coupling; or 3) that plasmin cleaves PAR-4 at the thrombin cleavage site at a slower rate than thrombin. Considering the first possibility, if only a subset of PAR-4 molecules were being activated by plasmin, then a prolonged platelet exposure to plasmin should not show any difference from what was observed (i.e. thrombin-mediated aggregation would continue to occur after plasmin treatment); however, our results show that prolonged plasmin activity renders platelets refractory to additional thrombin-mediated aggregation and calcium mobilization (Fig. 2B). Plasmin activation of human platelets can be blocked by treatment with thrombin inactivators and anti-thrombin receptor antibodies (27Watabe A. Ohta M. Matsuyama N. Mizuno K. el Borai N. Tanimoto T. Kawanishi T. Hayakawa T. Res. Commun. Mol. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1997; 96: 341-352Google Scholar), reflecting the general similarity of action between the two proteases. Also, our data show that the PAR-4 antagonist tc-YPGKF, which was designed to compete with the PAR-4 tethered ligand, interfered with the ability of plasmin to mediate platelet aggregation (Fig. 5); this suggested that plasmin generates the same tethered ligand on PAR-4 as would thrombin. Indeed, our hypothesis was corroborated when a mutation of the thrombin cleavage site on PAR-4 prevented its activation by plasmin as well as by thrombin (Fig. 7). This allowed us to discount the second possibility because plasmin must recognize PAR-4 in the same tertiary conformation as would thrombin to cleave PAR-4; therefore, a similar extent of G protein coupling should be realized. Furthermore, a 10-fold decrease in the rate of intracellular calcium release was observed with plasmin relative to thrombin in the PAR-4-transfected cells (Fig. 7A). Because intracellular calcium release is a proximal signaling event to the cleavage of PAR-4, it represents a reliable assessment of the rate at which PAR-4 is activated by the two proteases. Taken together with the findings of a lengthy period of exposure to plasmin required to effect desensitization of PAR-4 as well as an increased shape change function and relatively slow rate of aggregation onset relative to thrombin, we surmise that plasmin cleaves PAR-4 at a reduced rate compared with thrombin. In conclusion, plasmin mediates platelet aggregation predominantly through proteolytic cleavage of protease-activated receptor 4 that ultimately leads to integrin αIIbβ3 activation. In addition, the functional absence of PAR-1 has no effect on plasmin-mediated platelet aggregation, whereas a functional absence of PAR-4 inhibits this response. We thank Drs. Steven Seiler and Shaun Coughlin for their kind gifts of the BMS-200261 and the PAR-4 null mice, respectively. We also thank Dr. James Daniel for his critical review of the manuscript."

Surprisingly, none of the predicted active site residues of the parvulin-like domain was essential for growth and protein secretion, although several active site mutations reduced or abolished the PPIase activity or the ability of PrsA to catalyze proline-limited protein folding in vitro. Our results indicate that PrsA is a PPIase, but the essential role in vivo seems to depend on some non-PPIase activity of both the parvulin-like and flanking domains.

The rate-limiting steps in the folding of proteins containing cis-prolines are catalyzed by peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases). 1The abbreviations used are: PPIase, peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases; FKBP, FK506-binding proteins; AmyQ, α-amylase of B. amyloliquefaciens; PDB, Protein Data Bank; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WT, wild type; CsA, cyclosporin A. These ubiquitous proteins can be divided into three families, cyclophilins, FK506-binding proteins (FKBP), and parvulins (1Gothel S.F. Marahiel M.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 423-436Google Scholar). Because cyclophilins and FKBPs are targets of immunosuppressive drugs, they are called immunophilins. No specific inhibitor is available for parvulins. Although PPIases catalyze the isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds in vitro, the physiological role of many of these proteins is still unclear. The effects of their mutational inactivation vary from no phenotypic effect (2Dolinski K. Muir S. Cardenas M. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13093-13098Google Scholar) to severe defects (3Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Google Scholar, 4Dartigalongue C. Raina S.

PPIases may also act as chaperones either in a PPIase domain-dependent (7Ramm K. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17106-17113Google Scholar) or -independent (8Behrens S. Maier R. de Cock H. Schmid F.X. Gross C.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 285-294Google Scholar) manner, and they may have essential overlapping functions with other PPIases and chaperones (4Dartigalongue C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3968-3980Google Scholar, 9Deuerling E. Schulze-Specking A. Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Bukau B. Nature. 1999; 400: 693-696Google Scholar, 10Teter S.A. Houry W.A. Ang D. Tradler T. Rockabrand D. Fischer G. Blum P. Georgopoulos C. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1999; 97: 755-765Google Scholar). Members of the parvulin family have been found in all types of cells. The prototype member of the family is the parvulin of Escherichia coli (11Rahfeld J.-U. Schierhorn A. Mann K. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 65-69Google Scholar). It is a small cytoplasmic protein comprising essentially a PPIase domain only. In other members a homologous PPIase domain is flanked by N- and C-terminal domains of various lengths (12Schmid F.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 243-282Google Scholar). At least three subfamilies can be identified based on structural and functional differences. Pin1-type parvulins consist of an N-terminal WW domain followed by a PPIase domain. The plant members, however, lack the WW domain (12Schmid F.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 243-282Google Scholar, 13Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 876-886Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the human Pin1 protein has been solved, and the PPIase domain has been shown to consist of a four-stranded, anti-parallel, flattened β-barrel that is surrounded by four α-helices (βα3βαβ2) (13Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 876-886Google Scholar). The Pin1 protein binds specifically to a phosphorylated serine or threonine residue located N-terminal to proline. The WW domain, characteristically a module binding proline-rich sequence, and the PPIase domain are both involved in the binding of phosphorylated residues (14Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Google Scholar). The phosphate group is recognized by a conserved cluster of three positively charged residues located in the N terminus of the loop preceding α1 (13Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 876-886Google Scholar, 15Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Lu K.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Google Scholar). PPIases of this subfamily are involved in the regulation of mitosis (15Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Lu K.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Google Scholar), and linked to chromatin remodeling and general transcriptional regulation (5Wu X. Wilcox C.B. Devasahayam G. Hackett R.L. Arevalo-Rodriguez M. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Hanes S.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3727-3738Google Scholar). In the second subfamily the PPIase domain is similar to that of hPar14; the α1-helix and the loop that precedes it are several residues shorter than in Pin1 (16Sekerina E. Rahfeld J.-U. Müller J. Fanghänel J. Rascher C. Fischer G. Bayer P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1003-1017Google Scholar). Furthermore, these enzymes have an insertion in the loop between α4 and β3. The biological function of hPar14-type PPIases is unknown. In the third subfamily, the PPIase domain is similar to that of the E. coli parvulin. It lacks the hPar14-type insertion and the Pin1-type cluster of positively charged residues involved in the binding of phosphoserine and -threonine. Many PPIases of this subfamily are bacterial proteins required for the folding and/or maturation of extracytoplasmic proteins (16Sekerina E. Rahfeld J.-U. Müller J. Fanghänel J. Rascher C. Fischer G. Bayer P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1003-1017Google Scholar, 17Rudd K.E. Sofia H.J. Koonin E.V. Plunkett III, G. Lazar S. Rouviere P.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 12-14Google Scholar). The periplasmic SurA and PpiD, which have roles in the assembly of outer membrane proteins (4Dartigalongue C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3968-3980Google Scholar), belong to this subfamily. We have previously identified in Bacillus subtilis a membrane-bound lipoprotein, PrsA, which according to sequence similarity belongs to the parvulin family of PPIases (18Rahfeld J.-U. Rücknagel K.P. Schelbert B. Ludvig B. Hacker J. Mann K. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 180-184Google Scholar). In PrsA a stretch of 90 amino acids is 45% identical with E. coli parvulin. Furthermore significant homology is observed with parvulin-like or PPIase domains of all members of the parvulin family. This parvulin-like region is flanked by a 115- and 70-residue long N- and C-terminal region, respectively, which are not homologous to any regions of other parvulins except for those of PrsA-like proteins of species related to B. subtilis. So far it is not known whether the parvulin-like region and the flanking regions form separate domains. The first amino acid residue at the N terminus of the mature PrsA is a cysteine, which is covalently linked to a diacylglycerol molecule that anchors the protein to the membrane. It has been suggested that PrsA catalyzes or assists the post-translocational folding of extracytoplasmic proteins at the cytoplasmic membrane-cell wall interface (19Hyyryläinen H.L. Bolhuis A. Darmon E. Muukkonen L. Koski P. Vitikainen M. Sarvas M. Pragai Z. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Kontinen V.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1159-1172Google Scholar, 20Jacobs M. Andersen J.B. Kontinen V. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 957-966Google Scholar). The secretion rate of AmyQ α-amylase, a model protein used in many of our studies, is linearly dependent on the cellular level of PrsA (6Vitikainen M. Pummi T. Airaksinen U. Wu H. Sarvas M. Kontinen V.P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1881-1890Google Scholar). PrsA is an essential protein in B. subtilis, because decreasing its cellular level below 200 molecules per cell results in cell lysis (6Vitikainen M. Pummi T. Airaksinen U. Wu H. Sarvas M. Kontinen V.P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1881-1890Google Scholar). The lethal effect is partially suppressed by the increased negative charge density of the cell wall matrix (21Hyyryläinen H.-L. Vitikainen M. Thwaite J. Wu H. Sarvas M. Harwood C. Kontinen V. Spehenson K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26696-26703Google Scholar). A defect in PrsA results in the accumulation of misfolded AmyQ at the membrane-wall interface (19Hyyryläinen H.L. Bolhuis A. Darmon E. Muukkonen L. Koski P. Vitikainen M. Sarvas M. Pragai Z. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Kontinen V.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1159-1172Google Scholar). The accumulation of misfolded protein in the cell envelope activates the CssS/R two-component signal transduction pathway and consequently the synthesis of HtrA-type protein quality control proteases (19Hyyryläinen H.L. Bolhuis A. Darmon E. Muukkonen L. Koski P. Vitikainen M. Sarvas M. Pragai Z. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Kontinen V.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1159-1172Google Scholar). The mode of action of PrsA has not been studied as yet at the molecular level. We carried out a structure-function analysis of PrsA using deletions, pentapeptide insertion mutagenesis, and substitutions of individual amino acid residues. The structure of the parvulin-like region was modeled and used to mutate amino acid residues of the predicted catalytic site of the PrsA PPIase. We demonstrate that the parvulin-like domain indeed catalyzes peptidyl prolyl isomerization, and the N- and C-terminal domains are not needed for this activity. The parvulin-like domain folds correctly independently of the flanking domains. The PrsA function in protein secretion and viability is dependent on all three domains, but the PPIase activity is non-essential for the PrsA function in vivo. There are determinants in PrsA for the catalysis of proline-limited folding in a non-PPIase manner and for cooperation with the PPIase activity. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The B. subtilis strains used are 168 (trpC2) derivatives. In the viability and exoproteome studies, IH7211 with a chromosomal Pspac-prsA gene (6Vitikainen M. Pummi T. Airaksinen U. Wu H. Sarvas M. Kontinen V.P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1881-1890Google Scholar) was used as the parental strain. The complementation of prsA3 was determined with IH7492 (prsA3 trpC2 glyB133 hisA1), which expresses amyQ of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens from pKTH3382. The pKTH3382 plasmid was constructed by inserting the amyQ gene as a SalI fragment into pSR11 (22Kiewiet R. Kok J. Seegers J.F.M.L. Venema G. Bron S. Appl. Environ. Microb. 1993; 59: 358-364Google Scholar). IH7492 was also used as the parental strain to produce and purify various lipomodified PrsA proteins. The low protease strain B. subtilis WB600 (trpC2 ΔnprE ΔaprE Δepr Δbpf) (23Wu X.C. Lee W. Tran L. Wong S.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4952-4958Google Scholar) was used to produce nonlipomodified PrsA proteins in secreted form and E. coli BL21 (F-ompT hsdS (rB- mB-) gal) (24Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Vol. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar) to express GST-PrsA fusion proteins. Bacteria were typically grown in modified 2× L-broth (2% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, and 1% NaCl). Molecular Modeling—The PrsA PPIase domain structure was modeled based on the NMR structure of hPar14 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1EQ3) (16Sekerina E. Rahfeld J.-U. Müller J. Fanghänel J. Rascher C. Fischer G. Bayer P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1003-1017Google Scholar). The model was built using Insight II (Accelrys, Inc.). Compared with hPar14, the PrsA PPIase domain has two one-amino acid insertions and a 6-residue deletion (Fig. 2). The first insertion is located in the loop connecting α3 and β2. The other insertion is in the loop that participates in proline binding and connects β2 and α4. The only deletion shortens the loop between α4 and β3 to two residues. The length of this loop varies within the parvulin family. These were modeled by searching a loop from a data base containing either most or an unbiased selection of PDB structures. The loop data base is a PDB-select data base (1888 PDB structures). Several residues from both ends of the loop were used as anchors. The inserted loop was chosen so that it fits the secondary structures while at the same time having a low root mean square deviation from the anchor points. The model was refined by energy minimization with the Discover program using the Amber force field in a stepwise manner. First, the new loop was minimized while the borders of the new loops and the Cα atoms of the conserved regions (and finally only the Cα atoms of the conserved regions) were harmonically constrained. The model was evaluated using the PRO-CHECK program (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). Mutagenesis Techniques—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Oligonucleotides designed to mutate the prsA gene in pKTH3327 (6Vitikainen M. Pummi T. Airaksinen U. Wu H. Sarvas M. Kontinen V.P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1881-1890Google Scholar) were used in PCR reactions, followed by digestion of the template DNA with DpnI and transformation of the PCR-amplified mutant derivatives of pKTH3327 into E. coli XL-1 Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene). The prsA mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Gene Splicing by the Overlapping Extension (gene SOEing) method (26Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Google Scholar) was used to construct the prsAN+C mutant. The N-terminal (the ribosome-binding site, 1-402 and 675-695 base pairs of the encoding region) and C-terminal (675-876 base pairs of the encoding region and the translation termination site) fragments were PCR-amplified and fused using the SOE method. The resulting prsAN+C fragment was inserted into the unique HindIII site in the pDG148 (27Stragier P. Bonamy C. Karmazyn-Campelli C. Cell. 1988; 52: 697-704Google Scholar). To construct the prsA derivatives encoding truncated PrsA proteins, DNA fragments containing the ribosome-binding site and 444, 663, 780, 828, or 873 base pairs of the encoding region were PCR-amplified and cloned in pDG148. The constructions were verified by sequencing. The insertion mutagenesis was carried out as follows. First, the B. subtilis prsA gene was PCR-amplified with oligonucleotides 8874 (5′-CACATCGATGGAATGAGGAGTGTT-3′) and 8875 (5′-CAAGTCGACGCAGTTCTCAGCAGCATG-3′) using the chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis 168 as a template. The resultant fragment, which contains the ribosome-binding site, the coding region, and the transcription termination site of prsA, was cloned into the pGEM T-easy (Stratagene) vector. The plasmid obtained was mutagenized in vitro with the cat-Mu (NotI) transposon (28Poussu E. Vihinen M. Paulin L. Savilahti H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar) using the Mutation Generation System (Finnzymes) as essentially described (28Poussu E. Vihinen M. Paulin L. Savilahti H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). A pool of mutated plasmids was transformed into E. coli cells and subjected to a series of manipulations including recloning of the transposon containing prsA genes into pUC19 (24Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Vol. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar) and elimination of the resistance marker gene (cat) by NotI digestion and religation. The protocol produced a pool of about 35,000 prsA mutants. Next, the prsA genes, which contained 15-bp insertions, were again PCR-amplified using the plasmid pool as a template. The PCR primers contained the same homologous region as 8874 and 8875 oligonucleotides. The PCR fragments were inserted between the HindIII and SalI sites of the pDG148 plasmid, placing the prsA genes under the transcriptional control of the Pspac promoter. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli C600 cells (24Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Vol. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar). Plasmids from 75 transformants were isolated and subjected to HindIII-NotI and SalINotI double digestions to identify plasmids that contain only a single 15-bp in-frame insertion in the prsA gene. The outcome was that 49 plasmids fulfilled this criterion. The exact location of 31 insertions in these plasmids was determined by sequencing. Complementation of prsA3 and Lethality of PrsA Depletion—Complementation of prsA3 was examined by determining AmyQ secretion with a halo assay as previously described (29Koski P. Sarvas M. Schumann W. Ehrlich S.D. Ogasawara N. Functional Analysis of Bacterial Genes. A Practical Manual. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester2001: 15AGoogle Scholar). One bacterial colony was suspended in 0.5 ml of water, and 0.5-μl samples were pipetted onto L-plates containing 3% starch with or without 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The plates were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C followed by staining with iodine. The diameters of the halos around raised bacterial colonies were measured. The complementation of prsA3 with the PrsA variants containing site-directed mutations were also determined in liquid cultures. α-Amylase secretion was determined with the Phadebas amylase test (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (21Hyyryläinen H.-L. Vitikainen M. Thwaite J. Wu H. Sarvas M. Harwood C. Kontinen V. Spehenson K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26696-26703Google Scholar). To investigate the complementation of the lethality of PrsA depletion, the B. subtilis IH7211 (Pspac-prsA) was transformed with pDG148 derivatives containing mutant prsA genes. In the resultant strains, the chromosomal wild-type prsA gene and a plasmid-carrier of the mutant prsA gene were both under the control of the Pspac promoter. However, because the Pspac in the plasmids is leaky and that in the chromosome is tight, we were able to determine the complementation. Cells grown to the density of Klett 100 in the presence of 1 mm IPTG were harvested and washed once with L-broth, diluted 1000-fold in 2× L-broth, and then cultivated for 8-10 h. Growth was measured with a Klett-Summerson colorimeter. Purification of Lipomodified and Nonlipomodified PrsA Proteins— For the purification of lipomodified PrsA proteins, B. subtilis cells were grown in buffered tryptone broth (1% tryptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2% glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, 3.5 μm FeSO4, 3.5 μm ZnSO4, 0.45 mm MnSO4, 40 nm CuSO4, and 7 nm K2Cr2O7). In the early stationary phase, the cells were harvested, treated with lysozyme (4 mg/ml) for 30 min, and then sonicated until the viscosity disappeared. The cell membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 44,000 × g for 1 h 15 min and solubilized in 2% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) (Sigma-Aldrich). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was passed through a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 30 mm NaCl. The flow-through fraction containing PrsA was applied to a CM-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with a buffer containing 30 mm MES, pH 6.0, and 30 mm NaCl, and PrsA was eluted with 300 mm NaCl. From the solubilization step onward all the solutions contained 1% OG. In order to produce PrsA in secreted form, the type II signal peptide anchoring PrsA to the membrane was replaced with the type I signal peptide of AmyQ. The PrsA-secreting strain was grown in Terrific Broth (17 mm KH2PO4,72mm K2HPO4, 24 g liter-1 yeast extract, 12 g liter-1 tryptone, and 0.4% glycerol) containing 5% glucose at 37 °C to Klett 100 + 2 h. The protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added every half-hour after Klett 100. The culture supernatant was concentrated 20-fold by a Vivaflow 200 tangential flow concentrator (Viva-science) and applied to a Sepharose XL cation-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 30 mm MES, pH 6.0. PrsA bound to the column was eluted with 500 mm NaCl. Production and Purification of GST-PrsA Fusion Proteins—The GST gene fusion system was used to produce PrsA proteins in E. coli for purification. Cells were grown in 2× TY (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 1% NaCl) to Klett 50-70, and 0.2-1 mm IPTG was added to induce the synthesis of GST-PrsA fusion proteins from pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) derivatives containing prsA genes. After incubating for 3-4 h at 30 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and disrupted with a French Press. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation prior to applying the cell lysate into a glutathione-Sepharose 4 fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. After washing the column with phosphate-buffered saline, thrombin (1 unit/100 μg of fusion protein) was added to release PrsA from GST, and fractions containing PrsA were collected. Circular dichroism spectroscopy data were collected by a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan). PrsA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at A280 and in Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE. Ribonuclease T1 Refolding and Protease-coupled PPIase Assays— The proline-limited folding was assayed with ribonuclease T1 (RNase) essentially as has been previously described (30Fischer G. Wittmann-Liebold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Google Scholar). The RNase was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Centricon 3 filters (Amicon) were used to remove the ammonium sulfate of the RNase solution. To unfold the RNase, it was incubated at 20 μm concentration in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 8 m urea, and 1 mm EDTA for 1 h at room temperature. The refolding was initiated by diluting the solution 28.5- fold with a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 1 mm EDTA. The tryptophan fluorescence was measured at 320 nm (5-nm bandwidth) with excitation at 268 nm (3-nm bandwidth) using a Shimadzu RF-5000 or Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorophotometer. PrsA was added prior to the dilution at the final concentrations of 1-8 μm. When the foldase activity of lipomodified PrsA proteins was determined, 1% octylglucoside was added to the refolding buffer. The RNase refolding activity of nonlipomodified and lipomodified PrsA was measured at 10 and 12 °C, respectively. Cyclosporin A (CsA, Sigma-Aldrich) and FK506 (Calbiochem) were used at 5 μm concentrations to inhibit PPIase activities of putative contaminating cyclophilins and FKBP-type PPIases in the PrsA preparations, respectively. Juglone (Sigma-Aldrich), which is an inhibitor of numerous parvulins, was used at 7 μm concentrations as described (31Hennig L. Christner C. Kipping M. Schelbert B. Rücknagel K.P. Grabley S. Kullertz G. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5953-5960Google Scholar). Cyclophilin, which was used as a positive control, was from calf thymus and was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PPIase activities were expressed as kcat/Km (mm-1 s-1). A protease-coupled assay with α-chymotrypsin was used to determine PPIase activities with a tetrapeptide substrate (succinyl-Ala-Lys-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide) (Fischer et al., Ref. 40Fischer G. Bang H. Ludwig B. Mann K. Hacker J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1375-1383Google Scholar). The peptide concentration was 37.5 μm. Refolding of Chemically Unfolded Rhodanese—Unfolding and refolding of rhodanese was carried out essentially as previously described (32Ideno A. Yoshida T. Furutani M. Maruyama T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3139-3149Google Scholar). Rhodanese (Sigma Aldrich) was incubated at 38 μm concentration in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 6 m GdnHCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 25 °C. The refolding was initiated by a 60-fold dilution with the refolding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm sodium thiosulfate) in the absence or presence of folding factors. In experiments with GroELS, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm ATP were added to the refolding buffer. Over 60 min of incubation, aliquots were withdrawn at several time points. Rhodanese activity of the refolding reaction samples was measured as described in Ref. 33Horowitz P.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 40: 361-368Google Scholar. PrsA concentration was 5 μm. GroELS (2.5 μm) and bovine serum albumin (15 μm) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Extracellular Proteome Analysis—Cells of the B. subtilis IH7211 (Pspac-prsA) were grown with and without IPTG, and its derivative strains harboring plasmids for encoding mutant PrsA proteins were grown without IPTG in L-broth. In the transition to the stationary phase (t0) or an hour later (t1), cells were separated from the medium. Extracellular proteins in the medium were precipitated with ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and 100-μg samples were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis as described previously (34Antelmann H. Tjalsma H. Voigt B. Ohlmeier S. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Hecker M. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1484-1502Google Scholar). The resulting two-dimensional gels were fixed with a solution containing 50% (v/v) methanol and 7% (v/v) acetic acid, and stained with SYPRO Ruby protein gel stain (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence was detected using a Storm860 fluorescence imager (Molecular Dynamics). For quantification, samples from two independent experiments were resolved for each time point investigated, and the quantitative image analysis was performed with DECODON Delta two-dimensional software (www.decodon.com). Protein identification was carried out as previously described (34Antelmann H. Tjalsma H. Voigt B. Ohlmeier S. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Hecker M. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1484-1502Google Scholar). The N-terminal, C-terminal, and Parvulin-like Regions Are All Essential for PrsA Function in Vivo—Many parvulins consist of functionally and structurally independent domains (8Behrens S. Maier R. de Cock H. Schmid F.X. Gross C.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 285-294Google Scholar, 13Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 876-886Google Scholar, 16Sekerina E. Rahfeld J.-U.

Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 917-926Google Scholar). In order to identify which regions (or domains) of the PrsA protein are required for protein secretion and viability in B. subtilis, a series of deletion mutations of prsA were constructed, and the mutations were characterized for their effects on in vivo PrsA activity (Fig. 1). The constructed deletions of the C-terminal region either removed the whole region (PrsA-(1-202)), or part of it (PrsA-(1-256) and PrsA-(1-242)). We also constructed mutations that deleted the entire parvulin-like region (PrsA-(N+C)) or both the C-terminal and parvulin-like region (PrsA-(1-128)). Furthermore, PrsA-(33-258) molecules were designed that lacked the 32 N-terminal and 15 C-terminal amino acids. All mutant genes were expressed from an IPTG-inducible promoter in a multicopy plasmid. All mutant PrsA proteins were detected as abundant proteins by immunoblotting, indicating their in vivo stability. The cellular location of two proteins, PrsA-(1-242) and PrsA-(N+C), was studied"
https://openalex.org/W2039854324,"ASIC3, an acid-sensing ion channel subunit expressed essentially in sensory neurons, has been proposed to be involved in pain. We show here for the first time that native ASIC3-like currents were increased in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons following protein kinase C (PKC) stimulation. This increase was induced by the phorbol ester PDBu and by pain mediators, such as serotonin, which are known to activate the PKC pathway through their binding to G protein-coupled receptors. We demonstrate that this regulation involves the silent ASIC2b subunit, an ASIC subunit also expressed in sensory neurons. Indeed, heteromultimeric ASIC3/ASIC2b channels, but not homomeric ASIC3 channels, are positively regulated by PKC. The increase of ASIC3/ASIC2b current is accompanied by a shift in its pH dependence toward more physiological pH values and may lead to an increase of sensory neuron excitability. This regulation by PKC requires PICK-1 (protein interacting with C kinase), a PDZ domain-containing protein, which interacts with the ASIC2b C terminus.

Pain response results from both the immediate response to injury (acute pain) and the persistence of pain in the setting of tissue injury (chronic pain). Acute pain results from direct thermal, mechanical, or chemical activation of particular subsets of primary afferent neurons. In contrast, the persistent component of the pain is associated with the production and release of multiple inflammatory factors, including neurotransmitters and protons (for reviews, see Refs. 1Woolf C.J. Salter M.W. Science. 2000; 288: 1765-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar and 2Julius D. Basbaum A.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar). These act in concert not only to maintain activity of primary afferent nociceptors and sustain pain but also to heighten nociceptor sensitivity, such that innocuous stimuli produce pain (allodynia). Tissue injury and inflammation thus generate a variety of mediators that profoundly modulate sensory fiber activity and metabolism (3Dray A. Br. J. Anaesth. 1995; 75: 125-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), leading to sensitization. Activation of protein kinase pathways is a major mechanism responsible for this modulation (4Kamei J. Mizoguchi H. Narita M. Tseng L.F. Expert Opin. Investig.

Inflammatory mediators also have the potential to alter gene transcription and thereby induce long term alterations in the biochemistry of sensory neurons. For instance, recent studies have demonstrated that nerve growth factor and serotonin up-regulate the transcription of the gene encoding the proton-activated cation channel ASIC3 in nociceptors (12Voilley N. de Weille J.

Functional ASICs are homo- or heteromeric proton-gated Na+-permeable channels formed by the association of different subunits: ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, and ASIC3 (17Waldmann R. Lazdunski M.

ASIC3 is principally found in the small and medium nociceptive sensory neurons (12Voilley N. de Weille J. Mamet J. Lazdunski M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its expression has been associated with a biphasic current comprising a fast inactivating component followed by a sustained phase (19Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). It is involved in acid-evoked nociception in the ischemic myocardium (21Sutherland S.P. Benson C.J. Adelman J.P. McCleskey E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 33Benson C.J. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 34Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 869-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and in modulating moderate to high intensity pain sensation (35Chen C.C. Zimmer A. Sun W.H. Hall J. Brownstein M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8992-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). ASIC3 has also been proposed to be an acid sensor that could mediate hyperalgesia and pain in muscle (36Sluka K.A. Price M.P. Breese N.M. Stucky C.L. Wemmie J.A. Welsh M.J. Pain. 2003; 106: 229-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). ASIC2b, when expressed alone, is not activated by extracellular protons, but it associates with ASIC2a and/or ASIC3 to form heteromultimeric channels displaying different kinetics, pH dependence, and ion selectivity (18Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the ASIC3+2b heteromer, which is specific for sensory neurons and gives rise to a biphasic current with the sustained component displaying a modified selectivity, in response to an external acidification. It has been proposed that the structural element responsible for this loss of Na+ selectivity is the pretransmembrane domain 1 of ASIC2b (37Coscoy S. de Weille J.R. Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10129-10132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This sustained current is thought to play a role in the tonic sensation of pain caused by low pH values (pH of <6). Two different partner proteins of ASICs have been described: CIPP (channel-interacting PDZ domain-containing protein), which interacts with ASIC3 (38Anzai N. Deval E. Schaefer L. Friend V. Lazdunski M. Lingueglia E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16655-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and PICK-1 (protein interacting with protein kinase C), which interacts with ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC2b (39Duggan A. Garcia-Anoveros J. Corey D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5203-5208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 40Hruska-Hageman A.M. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These two proteins bind the C termini of ASICs via their PDZ domains. We have shown that CIPP increases the ASIC3 current density (38Anzai N. Deval E. Schaefer L. Friend V. Lazdunski M. Lingueglia E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16655-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and that PICK-1 potentiates the PKC regulation of ASIC2a (41Baron A. Deval E. Salinas M. Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50463-50468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although PICK-1 has only one PDZ domain, it can multimerize through its coiled-coil region (42Staudinger J. Lu J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 43Xia J. Chung H.J. Wihler C. Huganir R.L. Linden D.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 499-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and can, therefore, cross-link different binding partners. At the central level, interactions between PICK-1 and glutamate receptors have been described (for reviews, see Refs. 44Dev K.K. Nakanishi S. Henley J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 355-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and 45Collingridge G.L. Isaac J.T. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 47: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and PICK-1 has recently been implicated in the control of synaptic transmission by the mGluR7a receptor complex (46Perroy J. El Far O. Bertaso F. Pin J.P. Betz H. Bockaert J. Fagni L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2990-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This work shows that the PKC pathway is involved in the increase of ASIC3-like current recorded from cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons by inflammatory mediators such as serotonin or bradykinin. It also shows that this PKC regulation is conferred by the ASIC2b subunit, which brings the PKC-interacting protein PICK-1 into the heteromeric ASIC3+2b complex. RT-PCR Analysis—The expression of endogenous PICK-1 in COS-7 cells was tested at the mRNA level by RT-PCR on total RNA. 5 μg of total RNA, extracted with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), was reverse-transcribed by SuperScript™ II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). One-twentieth of this mixture was used for 35 cycles of PCR to test mRNA expression of ASIC2b, ASIC3, and PICK-1 or 25 cycles of PCR for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control. To get forward and reverse primers that match the monkey sequence (COS-7 is a cell line derived from African green monkey kidney), we have designed primers containing the very conserved regions between rat and human genes. The forward and reverse primers were 439TCCAAGGGGGACCTCTACTA458 and 758CCATCCTCGCCTGAGTTAAA739 for ASIC2b (nucleotide positions in the open reading frames of human ASIC2b, GenBank™ accession number AL834182), 169CTCTACCAGGTGGCTGA185 and 716ACTCGGATCCCCACCTCAAA697 for ASIC3 (nucleotide positions in the open reading frames of human ASIC3, GenBank™ accession number AF095897), 412GGCCTGAGCCGGGCCATCCT431 and 827CTGTATTCCTCGTCATCCAT808 for PICK-1 (nucleotide positions in the open reading frame of human PICK-1, GenBank™ accession number AL049654). The annealing temperature was 54 °C. In all cases, the forward and the reverse primers were located in different exons. Additional positive controls with 25 cycles of PCR were realized on a few nanograms of plasmids containing cDNAs of rat ASIC2b, rat ASIC3, and mouse PICK-1. Western Blot Analysis—For the preparation of whole cell lysates, COS-7 cells transfected or not by pCI-IRES-CD8-PICK-1 vector (DEAE-dextran protocol) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline after 3 days of expression, sonicated in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg of leupeptin, 5 μg of antipain, 5 μg of pepstatin A), and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. 100 μg of protein were loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10% gel) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences). Blots were saturated for 1 h at room temperature with 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween in Tris-buffered saline and incubated overnight with an affinity-purified goat anti-PICK-1 antibody (PICK-1 (N-18), sc-9539; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 100-fold in 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween in Tris-buffered saline, followed by an additional 1-h incubation with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson Laboratories), with extensive washing in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween after antibody incubation. Blots were finally developed with SuperSignal (Pierce). Plasmid Constructions and Mutagenesis—The mouse PICK-1 coding sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM008837; 96% amino acid identity with rat PICK-1) was amplified by RT-PCR from mouse brain cDNA and subcloned into the bicistronic vector pCI-IRES-CD8 (47Patel A.J. Honore E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) for expression in COS cells. The mPICK1ΔPDZ mutant was generated by double point mutation, K27A/D28A (48Xia J. Zhang X. Staudinger J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1999; 22: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The potential sites of phosphorylation by PKC, 40TLR and 523SHR in rat ASIC3 (GenBank™ accession number AAB69328), and RPS60 in rat ASIC2b (GenBank™ accession number CAA74979) were suppressed by single 40GLR, 523GHR, and RPG60 point mutations, respectively. In the mutant named rASIC2bΔC, the C-terminal PDZ binding domain was suppressed by deletion of the last three residues. Point mutations and deletions of rASIC2b, rASIC3, and mPICK-1 were performed by PCR strategies and verified by sequencing. The coexpression of rASIC2b, rASIC3, and mPICK-1 in the same cell was accomplished by cotransfection of two different constructions: the pCI-PICK1-IRES-CD8 bicistronic vector and the pBudASIC2b/ASIC3 vector. pBudCE4.1 (Invitrogen) is a vector designed for simultaneous expression of two genes in mammalian cells lines. The vector contains the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter and the human elongation factor 1α-subunit (EF-1α) promoter for high level, constitutive, independent expression of two recombinant proteins. On the one hand, the open reading frames of rASIC2b, rASIC2bS60G, or ASIC2bΔC were subcloned into the pBudCE4.1 vector under control of the EF-1α promoter. On the other hand, the open reading frames of rASIC3, rASIC3T40G, rASIC3S523G, or rASIC3TS40,523GG were subcloned into the second polylinker of pBudCE4.1 vector under the CMV promoter to get the following different combinations: pBud-ASIC3, pBud-ASIC2b, pBud-ASIC2b/ASIC3, pBud ASIC2bΔC/ASIC3, pBud-ASIC2bS60G/ASIC3, pBud-ASIC2b/ASIC3T40G, pBud-ASIC2b/ASIC3S523G, pBud-ASIC2b/ASIC3TS40, 523GG, and pBud-ASIC2bS60G/ASIC3TS40,523GG. rASIC2b, rASIC3, and mPICK-1 wild-type and mutant proteins used in the present work are schematically described in Fig. 1. Primary Culture of Rat DRG Neurons—Dorsal root ganglion neurons were dissected from Wistar rat (5–7 weeks) and enzymatically dissociated with 0.1% collagenase. Cells were then plated on collagen-coated 35-mm Petri dishes and maintained in culture at 37 °C (95% air, 5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. Electrophysiological experiments were carried out 1–3 days after plating. Expression and Electrophysiology in COS Cells—COS cells at a density of 20,000 cells per 35-mm diameter Petri dish were transfected with a mix of the bicistronic vector pCI-IRES-CD8 or pCI-PICK1-IRES-CD8, or pCI-PICK1ΔPDZ-IRES-CD8 with pBud-ASIC2b/ASIC3, or pBud-ASIC2bΔC/ASIC3, or pBud-ASIC2bS60G/ASIC3, or pBud-ASIC2b/ASIC3S523G, or pBudASIC2b/ASIC3T40G, or pBud-ASIC2b/ASIC3TS40,523GG, or pBud-ASIC2bS60G/ASIC3TS40,523GG (10:1 ratio) using the DEAE-dextran method. Cells were used for electrophysiological measurements 1–4 days after transfection. Successfully transfected cells were recognized by their ability to fix CD8 antibody-coated beads (Dynal). We used the patch-clamp technique to measure membrane currents in the whole cell configuration (49Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15118) Google Scholar). Currents were amplified with a RK-400 amplifier (Bio-Logic Science Instruments), digitized with a 16-bit data acquisition system (Digidata 1322A, Axon Instruments), and recorded on a hard disk using pClamp software (Clampex, version 8.2.0.224, Axon Instruments). Off-line analysis of currents was performed using pClamp (Clampfit, version 9.0.1.21). Data are represented as means ± S.E., and the statistical significance of differences between sets of data was estimated using the unpaired or paired Student's t test when appropriate. (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). Experiments were carried out at room temperature (20–22 °C). Patch-Clamp Solutions and Chemicals—The pipette solution contained (in mm): KCl 140, ATP-Na2 5, MgCl2 2, CaCl2 2.1, EGTA 5, HEPES 10 (pH 7.25), and the bath solution contained (in mm): NaCl 150, KCl 5, MgCl2 2, CaCl2 2, HEPES 10 (pH 7.4). MES was used instead of HEPES to buffer bath solution pH ranging from 6 to 5. For the experiments on DRGs, the external solutions were supplemented with glucose (10 mm) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 20 μm), and kynurenic acid (10 μm) was added to inhibit glutamate-induced currents. Cells were voltage-clamped to a constant holding potential, and extracellular pH changes were induced by shifting one of eight outlets of a microperfusion system in front of the cell. CNQX, kynurenic acid, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), the cell permeable diacylglycerol analog 1-oleyl 2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), serotonin, PKC inhibitors chelerythrine (CHEL), and the PKC fragment 19–36 were all from Sigma. The selective group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR-1) agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) was from Tocris. DRG Neuron ASIC3-like Current Is Increased by PKC Pathway Stimulation—Native pH 6.3- and pH 5-evoked ASIC3-like currents were recorded at –80 mV from cultured rat DRG neurons. These two pH values (6.3 and 5) were chosen as they induce half-maximal and maximal activation of the cloned ASIC3 current (19Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 38Anzai N. Deval E. Schaefer L. Friend V. Lazdunski M. Lingueglia E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16655-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). ASIC3-like currents were identified by kinetics (fast inactivation and biphasic time course), insensitivity to the toxin PcTX1 (which inhibits ASIC1a homomeric currents, Ref. 32Escoubas P. De Weille J.R. Lecoq A. Diochot S. Waldmann R. Champigny G. Moinier D. Menez A. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25116-25121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and pH sensitivity on activation (pH0.5 ∼6.3). The percentage of neurons expressing an ASIC3-like current was 24.7% (40/162), a value that is very similar to the 26.5% reported in a previous work already published by our group (13Mamet J. Baron A. Lazdunski M. Voilley N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10662-10670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These currents can include H+-gated currents flowing through homomeric ASIC3 channels and/or heteromeric ASIC3-containing channels such as ASIC3+2b (18Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F.

Zajac J.M. Lazdunski M. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 44: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the presence of a H+-sensitive K+ current in cultured rat DRG neurons (not shown) did not allow us to systematically discriminate between ASIC3 and ASIC3+2b currents at +30 mV (see below). Fig. 2 describes the effect of serotonin, bradykinin, the mGluR agonist DHPG, and of the phorbol ester PDBu on ASIC3-like current in DRG neurons. Indeed, protein kinase C pathway-coupled serotonin, bradykinin, and glutamate receptors (5HT2Rs, BKBRs, and group I mGluRs) have already been described in sensory neurons (51Chen J.J. Vasko M.R.

External application of serotonin induced an increase of the pH 6.3-evoked ASIC3-like peak current (Fig. 2A). This effect occurred rapidly (2 min after serotonin was introduced in the external medium), and it was reversed by the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (Fig. 2B). In the same way, external application of DHPG, a group I mGluRs agonist (Fig. 2A), or of the phorbol ester PDBu (Fig. 2A), also induced increases in the pH 6.3-evoked ASIC3-like peak current amplitude, which were both reversed by chelerythrine. It should be mentioned that in some experiments, chelerythrine application brought the current amplitude to a level lower than the initial basal one (data not shown), suggesting that basal PKC effect had occurred. These results indicate that PKC stimulation induces an increase of the ASIC3-like current in DRG neurons both when the kinase stimulation is direct (by PDBu) or when it takes place through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs, by serotonin, bradykinin, or DHPG). As described by Mamet et al. (13Mamet J. Baron A. Lazdunski M. Voilley N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10662-10670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in DRG neurons, pH 6.3-evoked ASIC3-like current generates membrane depolarizations that are close to the action potential (AP) threshold. Thus, the increase of the ASIC3-like current by PKC observed here would convert a submaximal current to a larger one, sufficient to reach the threshold of action potential triggering in DRG neurons. Both the effect of PDBu and serotonin were stronger on pH 6.3-evoked ASIC3-like currents than on pH 5-evoked ASIC3-like currents (+75.2 ± 16.3%, n = 6 versus +35.5 ± 12.1%, n = 4, p = 0.11 and +71.6 ± 10.2% versus +22.0 ± 12.5%, p < 0.05, respectively), strongly suggesting that the PKC pathway stimulation also shifts the pH dependence of ASIC3-like current toward more physiological pH values (Fig. 2C). Indeed, the pH 6.3/5 ratio allows us to estimate a shift of the sigmoidal pH activation curve (∼0.2 pH unit), assuming no change in the Hill slope number.

Arising from anomalies found in the variation of enzyme activity with temperature, a comparison has been made of experimental data for the activity and stability properties of five different enzymes with theoretical models. The results provide evidence for a new and fundamental third thermal parameter of enzymes, Teq, arising from a subsecond timescale-reversible temperature-dependent equilibrium between the active enzyme and an inactive (or less active) form. Thus, at temperatures above its optimum, the decrease in enzyme activity arising from the temperature-dependent shift in this equilibrium is up to two orders of magnitude greater than what occurs through thermal denaturation. This parameter has important implications for our understanding of the connection between catalytic activity and thermostability and of the effect of temperature on enzyme reactions within the cell. Unlike the Arrhenius activation energy, which is unaffected by the source (“evolved”) temperature of the enzyme, and enzyme stability, which is not necessarily related to activity, Teq is central to the physiological adaptation of an enzyme to its environmental temperature and links the molecular, physiological, and environmental aspects of the adaptation of life to temperature in a way that has not been described previously. We may therefore expect the effect of evolution on Teq with respect to enzyme temperature/activity effects to be more important than on thermal stability. Teq is also an important parameter to consider when engineering enzymes to modify their thermal properties by both rational design and by directed enzyme evolution.

Teq is also an important parameter to consider when engineering enzymes to modify their thermal properties by both rational design and by directed enzyme evolution. A graph of the rate of product generation against temperature is sometimes presented to show the “temperature optimum” (Topt) of an enzyme; however, it is a misconception that this optimum is an intrinsic enzyme property. The descending limb of this plot arises mostly from the denaturation of the enzyme and, because denaturation is both time- and temperature-dependent, shorter assays give a higher Topt. In this classical description, the variation in enzyme activity with temperature can be described as follows, Vmax=kcat⋅[E0]⋅e−kinact⋅t(Eq. 1) where Vmax = maximum velocity of the enzyme, kcat = the catalytic constant of the enzyme, [E0] = total concentration of enzyme, kinact = thermal inactivation rate constant, and t = assay duration. Both rate constants, kcat and kinact, are dependent on temperature. This gives rise to temperature/activity graphs as shown in Fig. 1A where it can be seen that the apparent Topt decreases with increasing time during the assay, but at zero time (i.e. under initial rate conditions) no temperature optimum exists (1Daniel R.M. Danson M.J. Eisenthal R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 223-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the Classical Model the temperature-dependent behavior of the enzyme arises from the activation energy of the reaction and the thermal stability of the enzyme.

Sci. 2001; 26: 223-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) has been made for a third temperature-dependent property of enzymes involving the reversible equilibrium between active and inactive forms of an enzyme and implying a “true” temperature optimum. In this model (the Equilibrium Model), the active form of the enzyme (Eact) is in reversible equilibrium with an inactive form (Einact), and it is the inactive form that undergoes irreversible thermal inactivation to the thermally denatured state (X), Eact⇄Einact→X as this reaction shows. In this situation, the concentration of the active enzyme at any time point is defined by (Eact)=(E0)−(X)1+Keq(Eq. 2) where Keq is the equilibrium constant between active and inactive forms of the enzyme (Keq = (Einact)/(Eact)). Thus Keq becomes a new temperature-dependent property of an enzyme in addition to kcat and kinact, and its variation with temperature is given by ln(Keq)=ΔHeqR(1Teq−1T)(Eq. 3) where ΔHeq is the enthalpic change associated with the conversion of an active to an inactive enzyme, and Teq is the temperature at the midpoint of transition between the two forms. That is, Teq is the temperature at which Keq = 1 and ΔGeq = 0, therefore, Teq = ΔHeq/ΔSeq. (We previously (1Daniel R.M. Danson M.J. Eisenthal R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 223-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) used the term Tm to designate this temperature but now prefer the term Teq, as it is the temperature at which the concentrations of Einact and Eact are equal.) In this Equilibrium Model the temperature-dependent behavior of an enzyme can be explained only by the inclusion of an additional intrinsic thermal parameter, Teq. The effect of incorporating the parameters Keq and Teq into the simulations (see Fig. 1B) yields major differences from the Classical Model shown in Fig. 1A showing an initial rate temperature optimum that is obviously independent of assay duration and enabling an experimental distinction between the two models. To compare the experimental data with the models, five enzymes from a variety of sources were assayed for activity at different temperatures, using continuous assays to allow the simultaneous measurement of activity and thermal stability in the same cuvette and, therefore, under identical conditions. These measurements allow the generation of a unique temperature profile for each enzyme. Most of this work has been carried out on monomeric enzymes to avoid the potentially complicating effects of subunit dissociation. The data presented support the Equilibrium Model hypothesis involving Keq as an intrinsic temperature-dependent property of enzymes. The consequence is that in such cases Teq must now be considered as a new thermal parameter that is a characteristic of any particular enzyme and that gives rise to a true temperature optimum. Enzymes and Reagents—Alkaline phosphatase from calf intestinal mucosa was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Adenosine deaminase from bovine spleen, aryl-acylamidase from Pseudomonas fluorescens, and β-lactamase from Bacillus cereus were purchased from Sigma. Acid phosphatase from wheat germ was purchased from Serva Electrophoresis GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany). Reagents for the analysis of the activity of these enzymes were purchased from Sigma, Merck, and Oxoid Ltd. (Basingstoke, UK). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Buffers were adjusted to the appropriate pH value at the assay temperature using a combination electrode calibrated at this temperature. Enzyme Assays—All enzymic activities were measured using continuous assays on a Thermospectronic™ helios γ-spectrophotometer equipped with a Thermospectronic™ single cell peltier effect cuvette holder. This system was networked to a computer installed with Vision32™ (Version 1.25, Unicam Ltd.) software including the Vision Enhanced Rate Programme capable of recording absorbance changes over time intervals of down to 0.125 s. Substrate concentrations were maintained at ∼10 times Km to minimize the effects of any possible increases in Km with temperature. Where these concentrations could not be maintained (e.g. because of substrate solubility), tests were conducted to confirm that there was no decrease in rate over the assay period because of substrate depletion. No evidence was found for either substrate or product inhibition under the experimental conditions described. Adenosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4, adenosine aminohydrolyase) activity was measured by following the decrease in absorbance at 265 nm (Δϵ265 = 8.1 mm–1·cm–1) resulting from the deamination of adenosine to inosine (7Pfrogner N.

One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 μmole/min adenosine to inosine at 30 °C. Acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2, orthophosphoric-monoester phosphohydrolase (acid optimum)) activity was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) 1The abbreviations used are: pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; pNAA, p-nitroacetanilide. as substrate (8Hollander V.P.

The release of p-nitrophenol was monitored at 410 nm (Δϵ410 = 3.4 mm–1·cm–1). One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 μmole/min pNPP to p-nitrophenol at 37 °C. Alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1, orthophosphoric-monoester phosphohydrolase (alkaline optimum)) activity was measured using pNPP as substrate (9Fernley H.N. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 4. Academic Press, New York1971: 417-447Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (1 ml) contained 0.1 m diethanolamine/HCl, pH 8.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm pNPP, and 0.02 units of enzyme. The release of p-nitrophenol was monitored at 405 nm (Δϵ405 = 18.3 mm–1·cm–1). One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 μmole/min pNPP to p-nitrophenol at 37 °C. Aryl-acylamidase (EC 3.5.1.13, aryl-acylamide amidohydrolyase) activity was measured by following the increase in absorbance at 382 nm (Δϵ382 = 18.4 mm–1·cm–1) corresponding to the release of p-nitroaniline from the p-nitroacetanilide (pNAA) substrate (10Hammond P.M. Price C.P. Scawen M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.6, 0.75 mm pNAA, and 0.018 units of enzyme. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to catalyze the hydrolysis of 1 μmole/min pNAA at 37 °C. β-lactamase (EC 3.5.2.6, β-lactamhydrolase) activity was measured by following the increase in absorbance at 485 nm (Δϵ485 = 20.5 mm–1·cm–1) associated with the hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring of nitrocefin (11O'Callaghan C.H. Morris A. Kirby S.M. Shingler A.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1972; 1: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm nitrocefin, and 0.003 units of enzyme. One unit is defined as that which will hydrolyze the β-lactam ring of 1 μmole of cephalosporin/min at 25 °C. Data Collection—For each enzyme, progress curves (absorbance versus time) at a variety of temperatures were collected, and the time interval was set so that an absorbance reading was collected every second. Assay reactions were initiated by the addition of microliter amounts of enzyme that had no significant effect on the temperature. Three progress curves were collected at each temperature, each for a 5-min period. Where the slope for these triplicates deviated by more than 10%, the reactions were repeated. Temperature was recorded using a Cole-Palmer Digi-Sense® thermocouple thermometer accurate to ±0.1% of the reading and calibrated using a Cole-Parmer NIST-traceable high resolution glass thermometer. The temperature probe was placed inside the cuvette adjacent to the light path during temperature equilibration prior to the initiation of the reaction and again immediately after completion of each enzyme reaction. Measurements of temperature were also taken at the top and bottom of the cuvette to check for temperature gradients. Where the temperature measured before and after the reaction differed by more than 0.1 °C, the reaction was repeated. Data Analysis—For each enzyme, the catalytic rates (expressed as μm·s–1) were calculated at 1 s time intervals along the three progress curves at each temperature. The averages of each time point value were used to generate three-dimensional plots of rate (v) versus temperature (T in Kelvin) versus time (t in seconds) (SigmaPlot® 2001 for Windows, Version 7.101, SPSS). Data were smoothed using a Loess transformation, a curve-fitting technique based on local regression that applies a tricube weight function to elicit trends from noisy data (12Cleveland W.S. Visualizing Data. Hobart Press, New Jersey1993Google Scholar). The first data point was obtained at ∼2 s because of the lag between the addition of enzyme to the reaction mixture and the start of data collection. The data for zero time were obtained during the smoothing process, which extrapolates back to zero using the trend elicited from the data. The data for each enzyme were analyzed to provide values of ΔGcat‡ (the activation energy of the catalytic reaction), ΔGinact‡ (the activation energy of the thermal inactivation process), ΔHeq (the enthalpy change for the transition between active and inactive forms of the enzyme), and Teq (the temperature for the midpoint of this transition). Initial estimates of these parameters were calculated from two-dimensional analyses. Firstly, for the data at t = 0 (where there is no thermal inactivation), Eyring plots of ln(v/T) versus 1/T give values of ΔHcat‡ and ΔScat‡ (from the slope and intercept, respectively) from which ΔGcat‡ can thus be calculated at any temperature of the assay. Secondly, at each assay temperature, plots of ln(v) versus time were used to calculate rate constants (kinact) for the thermal inactivation process; Eyring plots of these data (ln(kinact/T) versus 1/T) similarly give values of ΔHinact‡ and ΔSinact‡, and hence, of ΔGinact‡. Values of Keq were calculated from an Arrhenius plot (ln(v) versus 1/T) for the data at t = 0. That is, according to the Equilibrium Model (1Daniel R.M. Danson M.J. Eisenthal R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 223-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), in the absence of any thermal inactivation the deviation from linearity in the Arrhenius plot is attributed to a shifting of the equilibrium from active to inactive forms. A comparison of the observed values with those from the extrapolated linear portion can thus be used to calculate the value of Keq at any temperature. Using Equation 3, values of ΔHeq and Teq were subsequently determined from a plot of ln(Keq) versus 1/T. Using these estimates of the thermodynamic parameters, the complete data set for each enzyme (rate versus time versus temperature) was fitted to the Equilibrium Model equations to derive the values given in Table I. The fits were performed using Scientist software (Micromath), employing a non-linear least squares minimization of the numerically integrated rate equations utilizing Powell's algorithm.Table ISummary of experimentally determined thermodynamic parametersEnzymeOriginGrowth temp.ToptTeqΔGcat‡ΔGinact‡ΔHeq°C°C°CkJ·mol-1kJ·mol-1kJ·mol-1Aryl-acylamidaseP. fluorescens2541443793165β-lactamaseB. cereus3053753891103Acid phosphatasewheat germ15-25aSpring germination temperatures.646531138183Adenosine deaminasebovine spleen39597326100146Alkaline phosphatasebovine intestine39637018108220a Spring germination temperatures.

Protein Purification: Principles and Practice. Springer-Verlag, San Diego1994: 44-50Crossref Google Scholar). The overall dependence of velocity on temperature with time can be described in our model by the relationship, (Eq. 4) where kB is Boltzmann's constant and h is Planck's constant. A comparison of the simulated plots for the Classical and Equilibrium Models (Fig. 1, A and B) with the experimentally determined three-dimensional plots of rate versus time versus temperature (Figs. 1C and 2, A–D) shows that all the enzymes studied conform to the Equilibrium Model, i.e. they display clear temperature optima at time 0 when there can be no loss of activity because of thermal inactivation. Analysis of the data gives values for ΔGcat‡, ΔGinact‡, ΔHeq, and Teq for each enzyme (Table I) assuming that the data can be described by the Equilibrium Model. Taking adenosine deaminase as the example, these parameters were used to simulate the three-dimensional plot (Fig. 1D), and a comparison with the plot of the experimental data (Fig. 1C) shows excellent agreement. Similarly good agreement has been obtained with the four other enzymes (data not shown). Setting t = 0 in Equation 4 and differentiating with respect to T gives, (Eq. 5) and when dVmax/dT is set to zero (i.e. at the maximum of the rate/temperature profile in the observed range of T) T = Topt.It can be demonstrated that for the range of parameter values typically shown for enzymes, 1Teq−1Topt≈−RΔHeqln(ΔHeq−ΔGcat‡ΔG‡cat)(Eq. 6) and further manipulation provides the relationship Topt≈Teq(1−αTeq)(Eq. 7) where α≈RΔHeqln(ΔHeq−ΔGcat‡ΔGcat‡) and α is small (such that αTeq ≪ 1). Thus in general, for enzymes whose thermal activity-dependence follows the Equilibrium Model, Topt will be close in value to Teq and always smaller (by the term αTeq2). Across the range of values of ΔGcat‡ and ΔHeq encountered in this study, Topt and Teq follow an essentially linear relationship. A plot of relative activity at zero time versus temperature (Fig. 3) illustrates that all five enzymes display a true temperature optima of catalytic activity as defined by the Equilibrium Model and that the values of Topt are essentially in accordance with the determined values of Teq (Table I). For β-lactamase and adenosine deaminase, the difference between Topt and Teq is greater than for the other enzymes, and both enzymes have relatively low ΔHeq values, which will have a major influence on this difference (Equation 7). It should be stressed that ΔGinact‡ is not a factor in the position of the peaks illustrated in Fig. 3 as the curves are determined at time zero where there is no thermal inactivation process. As also noted by Thomas and Scopes (2Thomas T.M. Scopes R.K. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), in all cases reported here the Topt is ∼20–40 °C above the optimum growth temperature/body temperature of the source organisms. Although the application of the Equilibrium Model has the potential to be complicated by temperature-induced subunit dissociation in the case of oligomeric enzymes, we find no evidence to suggest that this treatment is restricted to monomeric enzymes. The data for the dimeric alkaline phosphatase adhere equally well to the Equilibrium Model as do the other, monomeric, enzymes investigated here. The results and their analysis indicate that the experimental velocity data as a function of temperature can be described by the Equilibrium Model, suggesting Keq as an intrinsic temperature-dependent property of enzymes and supporting the hypothesis that these enzymes possess a third thermal parameter (Teq) alongside the Arrhenius activation energy and the activation energy for thermal stability. Currently, we have no evidence bearing on the molecular basis of the equilibrium between Eact and Einact, although it is clearly a fast process relative to thermal denaturation. All the variation of activity with temperature at zero time (Figs. 2 and 3) occurs as a result of changes in the Eact/Einact equilibrium and is thus attained over timescales shorter than the mixing process, for example, <1 s, whereas the measured rate of irreversible thermal inactivation (conversion from Einact to denatured state) is at least two orders of magnitude slower over the same temperature range. For example, in the case of arylacylamidase (Fig. 2A), at 51 °C the activity at time zero is ∼40% lower than at the “optimum” temperature (46 °C), whereas the activity/timeline at this temperature shows that it takes ∼60 s for 40% denaturation to occur. As the native/denatured transition is generally a two-state process for single-domain proteins (14Creighton T.E. Proteins. W. H. Freeman, New York1993: 287-325Google Scholar), Einact is unlikely to be significantly unfolded. A reversible conformational change is most likely, and we speculate that the differing effects of temperature on the various weak interactions stabilizing the protein structure offer an opportunity for a shift of structure with changing temperature leading to a change in activity. The existence of conformational substates in equilibrium over sub-second timescales is widely accepted (15Brooks C.L. Karplus M. Pettitt B.M. Adv. Chem. Phys. 1988; 71: 1-259Google Scholar, 16Svensson A.-K. O'Neill Jr., J.C. Matthews C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 569-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested recently that adaptation to thermal stability may involve a change in the scale of fluctuations around the average state (17Wintrode P.L. Zhang D. Vaidehi N. Arnold F.H. Goddard III, W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 745-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Teq is important in describing the effect of temperature on enzymes and in particular on the role of temperature as a selection pressure on enzyme structure and function. There is no evidence connecting the Arrhenius activation energy of an enzyme to its thermal environment, and although there is a strong correlation between thermal stability and the environmental temperature of the source organism, it is known that enzyme thermal stability also reflects resistance to other cellular conditions such as the action of proteases (18Daniel R.M. Dines M. Petach H.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Teq is central to the physiological adaptation of an enzyme to its environmental temperature and links the molecular, physiological, and environmental aspects of the adaptation of life to temperature in a way that has not been possible previously. We predict that Teq will be a better expression of the effect of environmental temperature on the evolution of the enzyme than thermal stability. Thus we might expect differences in the overall shapes of the curves such as those shown in Fig. 2 to describe the fit of an enzyme to its thermal environment, especially at the high temperature part of the graph, because the shape of the low temperature part of the graph will be determined largely by the Arrhenius activation energy. Teq thus provides an important new parameter for matching the properties of an enzyme to its cellular and environmental function. In terms of protein engineering, Teq provides an additional parameter that determines the thermoactivity of an enzyme and therefore must be considered when designing enzymes for particular functions. Much of the enzyme engineering is directed at stabilizing enzymes against denaturation. The results here suggest that engineering to manipulate the Eact/Einact equilibrium (i.e. Teq) may be equally productive and that Teq must also be shifted to higher temperatures to obtain the expected catalytic benefits of enhanced enzyme thermostability. It will be important to distinguish between mutations that affect stability from those that affect Teq. We thank C. Collet for some of the preliminary work on β-lactamase and C. Cary and C. Monk for assistance in collecting some of the data presented in this paper."

J., and Newton, R. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 6607–6610). We now show that this effect also occurs in BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells as well as with other PKC inhibitors (Gö 6976, GF109203X, and calphostin C) in A549 cells. Similarly, phorbol ester, a diacylglycerol mimetic, activates NF-κB-dependent transcription and potentiates tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced NF-κB-dependent transcription, yet unlike TNFα, poorly activates IκB kinase (IKK) activity, IκBα degradation, or NF-κB DNA binding in both A549 and BEAS-2B cells. As phorbol ester-induced NF-κB-dependent transcription was relatively insensitive to the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, PKC may affect NF-κB-dependent transcription via mechanisms other than the core IKK-IκB pathway. This is supported by Gal4 one hybrid analysis of p65/RelA transactivation, which was potentiated by TNFα and phorbol ester and was inhibited by Ro 31-8220 and D609. Additionally, a number of PKC isoforms, particularly the novel isoform PKCϵ, induced p65/RelA transactivation. Phosphorylation of p65/RelA and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) was increased by TNFα treatment and, in the case of CBP, was prevented by Ro 31-8220 or D609. However, p65/RelA-CBP interactions were unaffected by either compound. As this effect was not limited to NF-κB, but was a more general feature of inducible gene transcription, we suggest PKC isoforms may provide a point of intervention in diseases such as inflammation, or cancer, where activated gene expression is prominent.

In inflammation, the binding of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα 1The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; 4α-PMA, 4α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; IKK, IκB kinase; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CRE, cAMP response element; COX, cyclooxygenase; DAG, diacylglycerol; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PC-PLC, phosphatidyl-specific phospholipase C; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutrate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; TRE, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element; TSA, tricostatin A; IL, interleukin. or IL-1β, to their respective receptors results in the rapid activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). This process involves various signaling molecules and leads to the activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which consists of two closely related kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, and the structural protein IKKγ (1Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Google Scholar). Phosphorylation and activation of this complex, particularly IKKβ, leads to the phosphorylation, ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor protein, IκBα. Loss of IκBα releases NF-κB, typically heterodimers of p50 (NFκB1) and p65 (RelA), which can then translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription. However, there is considerable data to suggest that this process is not sufficient for transcriptional action (2Schmitz M.L. Bacher S. Kracht M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 186-190Google Scholar). For example, we have previously reported that the protein kinase C inhibitor, Ro 31-8220, and the phosphotidycholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) inhibitor, D609, had no effect on the induction of NF-κB DNA binding by TNFα or IL-1β yet totally ablated NF-κB-dependent transcription (3Bergmann M. Hart L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6607-6610Google Scholar). A number of similar observations have also been made using inhibitors of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (4Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Google Scholar, 5Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Google Scholar, 6Wesselborg S. Bauer M.K. Vogt M. Schmitz M.L. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12422-12429Google Scholar), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (7Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Google Scholar), protein kinase A (8Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Google Scholar), tyrosine kinases (9Nasuhara Y. Adcock I.M. Catley M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19965-19972Google Scholar), and others (see Ref. 2Schmitz M.L. Bacher S. Kracht M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 186-190Google Scholar). Taken together these data suggest that a number of additional signal transduction pathways are required, which impact on events post-DNA binding, but are nevertheless necessary for NF-κB-dependent transcription. Candidate protein targets for these additional activation pathways include components of the transcriptional apparatus (5Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Google Scholar), co-activator molecules (8Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Google Scholar), as well as NF-κB itself (2Schmitz M.L. Bacher S. Kracht M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 186-190Google Scholar). In this context, p65 is widely reported to exist as a phosphoprotein, and a number of studies have documented its signal-induced phosphorylation (10Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Google Scholar, 11Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Google Scholar, 12Diehl J.A. Tong W. Sun G. Hannink M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2703-2707Google Scholar, 13Bird T.A. Schooley K. Dower S.K. Hagen H. Virca G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32606-32612Google Scholar). Similarly, p50 may also be phosphorylated (11Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Google Scholar). While the exact role (or roles) of NF-κB phosphorylation is currently equivocal, an initial report that phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of p65, within the C-terminal activation domain, correlated with increased transactivation potential has set the prevailing theme (10Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Google Scholar). Likewise, inhibitors of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and the extracellular reglated kinase pathway were able to reduce p65-dependent transactivation (14Berghe W.V. Plaisance S. Boone E. De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Fiers W. Haegman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Google Scholar), while the PI3K/Atk (protein kinase B) pathway was implicated in p65 phosphorylation and p65-dependent transactivation (7Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Google Scholar, 15Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Google Scholar, 16Madrid L.V. Mayo M.W. Reuther J.Y. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18934-18940Google Scholar). Analysis and mapping of phosphorylated residues in p65 has variously revealed serines 529 and 536, within the transactivation domain as being phosphorylated following TNFα treatment (17Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Google Scholar, 18Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these residues, at least in some studies, is believed to occur via the IKKs and appears to enhance transcriptional activation (17Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Google Scholar, 18Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Google Scholar, 19Yang F. Tang E. Guan K. Wang C.Y. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5630-5635Google Scholar). This contrasts with reports that implicate serine 276 in phosphorylation and transcriptional activation by protein kinase A (PKA) via a mechanism that involves enhanced association with the transcriptional co-activator CREB-binding protein (CBP) (8Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Google Scholar, 20Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Google Scholar). In the present manuscript, we have extended our previous observations by further exploring the mechanism of inhibition of NF-κB-dependent transcription by the PKC inhibitor, Ro 31-8220, and the PC-PLC inhibitor, D609 (3Bergmann M. Hart L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6607-6610Google Scholar). We provide evidence of a novel activation pathway, which impacts on transcriptional competency at a point downstream of transcription factor binding to DNA. Cell Culture and Drugs—A549 and BEAS-2B cells were obtained from European Collection of Cell Cultures and were cultured without antibiotics as previously described (21Newton R. Hart L.A. Stevens D.A. Bergmann M. Donnelly L.E. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 81-89Google Scholar). TNFα and IL-1β were both from R & D Systems (Oxon, UK) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), and 4α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (4α-PMA) were from Sigma (Poole, UK). Ro 31-8220, Gö 6976, GF109203X, wortmannin, LY294002, and H-89 (all from Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). D609 (Alexis, Nottingham, UK) and MG-132 (Calbiochem) were dissolved in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma). Drugs were added 10 min prior to stimulation. Trichostatin A (TSA) (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol and added 60 min prior to stimulation. In all cases final concentrations of Me2SO and ethanol were no more than 0.1% (v/v), and at this level there was no effect on activation of NF-κB or NF-κB-dependent transcription (data not shown). Cells were utilized at confluence and were incubated overnight in serum free media prior to treatments. EMSA, Western Blot Analysis, and IKK Kinase Assay—EMSA, Western blot analysis, and IKK kinase were as previously described (9Nasuhara Y. Adcock I.M. Catley M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19965-19972Google Scholar, 21Newton R. Hart L.A. Stevens D.A. Bergmann M. Donnelly L.E. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 81-89Google Scholar). NF-κB probe (consensus NF-κB site GGG GAC TTT CCC) was from Promega (Southhampton, UK). Western blot analysis was performed using conventional SDS-PAGE prior to transfer to Hybond-ECL membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Chalfont, UK) and detection of proteins was performed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies used for Western blot analysis: were p65 (Sc-109 or Sc-372, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IκBα (Sc-371, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Ser-32 phospho-IκBα (Sc-9240, Cell Signaling, Hitchin, UK), IKKα (H744, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IKKβ (H740, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CBP (A22 and C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and acetylated histone H4 (AHP418, Serotec). All buffers for Western blot or EMSA analysis were supplemented with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 50 mm NaF. Luciferase Reporter Constructs and Stable Transfectants—A549 cells harboring the NF-κB-dependent reporter, 6κBtkluc, which contains six copies of the consensus NF-κB binding site (GGG ACT TTC C) has previously been described (3Bergmann M. Hart L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6607-6610Google Scholar). Likewise the CRE and TRE A549 cells were generated by transient transfection of 8 μg of CRE and TRE luciferase reporter plasmids into preconfluent A549 or BEAS-2B cells in a T-75 using Tfx50 (Promega) as previously described (3Bergmann M. Hart L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6607-6610Google Scholar, 21Newton R. Hart L.A. Stevens D.A. Bergmann M. Donnelly L.E. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 81-89Google Scholar). These plasmids have six CRE or TRE (AP-1) sites, respectively, positioned upstream of a minimal β-globin promoter driving a luciferase gene as well as a separate neomycin gene to confer resistance to G-418 (22Himmler A. Stratowa C. Czernilofsky A.P. J. Recept. Res. 1993; 13: 79-94Google Scholar, 23Stratowa C. Machat H. Burger E. Himmler A. Schafer R. Spevak W. Weyer U. Wiche-Castanon M. Czernilofsky A.P. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 1995; 15: 617-630Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml (A549) G-418 until foci of transfected cells appeared. These were harvested to create a heterogenous population, randomized for integration site, and the lines expanded for generation of stocks and experimental procedures. The constitutively active SV40 A549 cells contain the plasmid pGL3control.neo, which was generated by inserting a ∼1.15-kb SalI/XhoI fragment containing the neomycin gene expression cassette from pMC1(Poly(A)) (Stratagene) into the SalI site downstream of, and in the same orientation as, the luciferase gene on pGL3control (Promega). A similar procedure was used to generate pGL3basic.neo from pGL3basic (Promega). The TATA-driven luciferase reporter, pGL3.neo.TATA, was generated by inserting a double-stranded oligonucleotide (sense strand 5′-AGC TTT CGA CCT TGG GTA TAA AAG GCA GAG CAC TGC AGC TGC TGC TTA CA), which corresponds to a modified (C to T substitution underlined) minimal β-globin promoter, into the HindIII site of pGL3basic.neo. The 2×GRE reporter, pGL3.neo.TATA.2GRE, was generated by digestion of pGL3.neo.TATA at the SmaI site, upstream of the minimal promoter, and insertion of a double-stranded oligonucleotide (sense strand 5′-GCT GTA CAG GAT GTT CTA GGC TGT ACA GGA TGT TCT AG-3′) containing two tandem copies of a consensus GRE site (underlined) (24Strahle U. Klock G. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7871-7875Google Scholar). Generation of the SV40, TATA, and GRE A549 reporter lines was achieved by transient transfection of the plasmids pGL3Control.neo, pGL3.neo.TATA, and pGL3.neo.TATA.2GRE and G-418 selection of stable recombinants as above. The BEAS-2B 6κBtk reporter cell line was also generated by this approach using the plasmid 6κBtk.neo and a G-418 concentration of 0.075 mg/ml as described above (3Bergmann M. Hart L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6607-6610Google Scholar). In all cases luciferase reporter cell lines were incubated overnight in serum-free G-418-free medium prior to stimulation. Reporter cells were harvested in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) 6 h after treatments and luciferase activity was determined using a commercial kit (Promega). One-hybrid p65 Transactivation Assay—The Gal4-dependent reporter, Gal4-luc, which contains two copies of a yeast Gal4 binding site cloned upstream of a minimal promoter driving a luciferase gene, and the expression vector containing the full-length human p65 fused downstream of a Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4-p65) have been previously described (10Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Google Scholar, 14Berghe W.V. Plaisance S. Boone E. De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Fiers W. Haegman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Google Scholar). Preconfluent A549 cells were transfected in 6-well plates with 0.1 μg of Gal4-luc and 0.5 μg of Gal4-p65 fusion using Tfx50 according to the manufacturers instructions (Promega). After 24 h cells were treated with stimuli or drugs and after a further 6-h luciferase activity was measured as above. For analysis of constitutively active PKC isoforms, cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of Gal4-luc and 0.5 μg of Gal4-p65 plus variable amounts, up to a maximum of 2 μg, of previously described expression plasmids for constitutively active PKC isoforms α, β1, δ, ϵ, η, and ζ (25Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Scopus (684) Google Scholar). In all cases the total DNA content was maintained at 2.6 μg/well by the addition of empty vector. After 24 h cells were harvested and luciferase activity measured. Immunoprecipitation and Metabolic Labeling of p65 and CBP—Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation was essentially as described (9Nasuhara Y. Adcock I.M. Catley M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19965-19972Google Scholar). Prior to stimulation, cells were incubated for 2 h in phosphate-free medium (Sigma) and for 4 h in phosphate-free medium supplemented with 0.25 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences). For p65, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). After preclearing for 1 h, 4 °C with 1 μg of normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), immunoprecipitation was performed with 5 μl of p65 agarose-conjugated antibody (SC-109AC, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C supplemented where indicated with 50 μl of blocking peptide (SC-109P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For CBP, cells were lysed in mild lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). After preclearing, immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C using 2 μg of CBP antibody (C20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Precipitates were washed four times with the lysis buffer, and after boiling in Western sample buffer, each sample was divided into halves and subjected to SDS-PAGE and either autoradiography or Western blot analysis (p65-Sc-372, CBP-A22). In Vivo Histone Acetyltransferase (HAT) Assay—Cells at 50% confluence were incubated in serum free media for 24–48 h until synchronized and total histone acetylation assessed as described previously (26Ito K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Google Scholar). After incubated with 0.005 mCi/ml [3H]acetic acid, cells were stimulated and harvested in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 50 mm sodium bisulfite, 10 mm MgCl2, 8.6% sucrose, 2% Triton X-100, 100 ng/ml TSA supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Pure nuclei were obtained by three further washes in lysis buffer and one wash in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 13 mm EDTA, 100 ng/ml TSA. Histone proteins were acid extracted at 4 °C for 1 h in 0.2 m HCl, 0.4 m H2SO4, and incorporation of 3H was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Results were normalized to protein content. For Western blot analysis of acetylated histone H4, histone proteins were acetone concentrated overnight at -20 °C, and 10 μg was used. Immunoprecipitation-HAT Assay—CBP immunoprecipitation was performed as described above, and precipitates were washed with HAT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol. Precipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of HAT buffer supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml histone II-A (Sigma). HAT assay was started by adding 0.1 μCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated for 45 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by spotting samples onto Whatman P81 paper (Whatman). After rinsing twice with cold HAT buffer filters were subject to liquid scintillation counting. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA extraction and Northern blot analysis were carried out using standard procedures as previously described (27Newton R. Seybold J. Kuitert L.M.E. Bergmann M. Barnes P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32312-32321Google Scholar). Probes for COX-2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were as previously described (27Newton R. Seybold J. Kuitert L.M.E. Bergmann M. Barnes P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32312-32321Google Scholar). In each case other probes were generated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification using the indicated primers, cloning, and verification by sequencing. Excised inserts were 32P-radiolabeled using the random primed method (Ready-Prime kit) (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK). Primer pairs (5′ > 3′) were: c-fos (K00650), TTC ATT CCC ACG GTC ACT GCC ATC (forward) and GTC TTC AGC TCC ATG CTG ATG CTC (reverse); c-jun (J04111), CTA TGA CGA TGC CCT CAA CGC CTC (forward) and GGA TTA TCA GGC CCA GCT (reverse); IκBα (M69043), GGA CTC CAT GAA AGA CGA GGA (forward) and AAG TCT CGG AGC TCA GGA TCA (reverse); IL-8 (M26383), CTA GGA CAA GAG CCA GGA AGA (forward) and AAC CCT CTG CAC CCA GTT TTC (reverse); p50/p105 (M58603), GCA AAG GTT ATT GTT CAG TT (forward) and GCT TGC AAA TAG GCA AGG TC (reverse). Inhibitors of Protein Kinase C Prevent NF-κB-dependent Transcription but Not p65 Translocation—In our previous studies (3Bergmann M. Hart L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6607-6610Google Scholar), we showed that the induction of NF-κB-dependent transcription by TNFα was completely blocked by D609, a reported PC-PLC inhibitor, and Ro 31-8220, a PKC inhibitor, yet the activation of NF-κB DNA binding or IκBα degradation was unaltered. To further explore this effect, we have also tested the known inhibitors of PKC, Gö 6976, GF109203X, as well as the structurally unrelated inhibitor, calphostin C. In each case, there was no effect on DNA binding as determined by EMSA, whereas robust inhibition of NF-κB-dependent transcription was observed (Fig. 1, A and B). This result was confirmed by Western blotting of nuclear extracts, which revealed no effect of either Ro 31-8220 or Gö 6976 on nuclear translocation of p65 (Supplemental Fig. S-1). Similarly, confocal microscopy revealed that neither the Gö 6976 nor D609 had any inhibitory effect on the nuclear translocation of p65 following TNFα stimulation of A549 cells (Supplemental Fig. S-2). Ro 31-8220 and D609 Prevent NF-κB-dependent Transcription in BEAS-2B Cells—To examine the possibility that these effect were due to a peculiarity of the A549 cells system, the bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, was also treated with TNFα in the presence or absence of both Ro 31-8220 or D609. In neither case was there any effect on the induction of NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 1C), yet activation of the NF-κB-dependent reporter, 6κBtk, was substantially repressed (Fig. 1D) suggesting that our data are more generally applicable. Phorbol Ester Activates NF-κB-dependent Transcription by a Mechanistically Distinct Process—To further substantiate the role of PKC, 6κBtk A549 cells were stimulated with the DAG mimetic, PMA, which is a potent activator of PKC. This markedly induced NF-κB-dependent transcription and was also prevented by inhibitors of PKC (Fig. 1B). Analysis of the concentration-response characteristics for PMA revealed that a maximal response was achieved at 10-7m (Fig. 2A), a value that is consistent with other PKC-mediated events. A combination of a maximally effect dose of TNFα (10 ng/ml) with a maximally effect dose of PMA (10-7m) resulted in a strongly enhanced luciferase response suggesting that these two treatments act via independent pathways to activate transcription (Fig. 2A). Similarly, PDBu (10-7m) also induced NF-κB-dependent transcription, whereas the inactive analog 4α-PMA (10-7m) was without effect suggesting that these effects are indeed specific (data not shown). Analysis of NF-κB DNA binding was consistent with our previous findings in showing a strong increase following TNFα or IL-1β treatment and only a very weak induction following PMA treatment (Fig. 2B) (28Newton R. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 518-523Google Scholar, 29Catley M.C. Chivers J.E. Cambridge L.M. Holden N. Slater D.M. Staples K.J. Bergmann M.W. Loser P. Barnes P.J. Newton R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 75-79Google Scholar). To our initial surprise the combination of TNFα plus PMA resulted in an apparent decrease in DNA binding activity with respect to TNFα alone. However, this result could be explained by the increased NF-κB-dependent transcription following combined TNFα + PMA treatment resulting in elevated expression of the NF-κB-dependent IκBα gene (30Ito C.Y. Kazantsev A.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3787-3792Google Scholar). This in turn would accelerate feedback inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding. To examine the ability of TNFα and PMA to activate the primary IKK-IκBα pathway involved in NF-κB activation, the IKK complex was immunoprecipitated and kinase activity assessed. As is normally observed (31DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Google Scholar, 32Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Google Scholar), TNFα produced a profound activation of IKK activity that was maximal within 5 min of treatment (Fig. 2C). This activity was mirrored in the rapid phosphorylation (mobility shift) of IκBα observed at 5-min post-stimulation and the complete degradation within 15 min of treatment (Fig. 2D). In marked contrast, PMA failed to induce IKK kinase activity to any great extent and did not result in substantial loss of IκBα (Fig. 2, C and D). Analysis of the 6κBtk BEAS-2B cells also revealed maximally effective concentrations of 10-7m (EC50 = 1.43 10-8m) and 10 ng/ml (EC50 = 0.16 ng/ml) for PMA and TNFα, respectively (data not shown), and these when added together resulted in a slight (but nonsignificant) enhancement of reporter activity. Consistent with the A549 study, PMA produced a very minor increase in NF-κB DNA binding over basal levels and failed to induce both IκBα degradation or the appearance of S-32 phosphorylated IκBα (Fig. 2, F and G). Conversely, TNFα strongly activated both NF-κB DNA binding, phosphorylation of IκBα, and subsequent loss of IκBα (Fig. 2, F and G). Therefore the data from these two cell line models demonstrate that, whereas TNFα robustly activates the IKK-IκBα pathway to result in NF-κB nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation, this is not primarily the mechanism that accounts for transcriptional activation by phorbol esters. To test the requirement for proteasome activity in the response to PMA, A549 cells and 6κBtk A549 cells were treated with TNFα or PMA in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132 (33Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Google Scholar). This has previously shown to be effective in A549 cells against TNFα-induced activation of NF-κB and IL-8 expression (34Fiedler M.A. Wernke Dollries K. Stark J.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 259-268Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of IκBα degradation revealed a marked inhibition by MG-132 (Fig. 3A). No effect of MG-132 was observed on IκBα following PMA treatment due to the lack of obvious degradation by PMA alone. Likewise, MG-132 was an effective inhibitor of TNFα-induced NF-κB-dependent transcription at concentrations (30 μm) that also inhibited IκBα degradation (Fig. 3B). Little or no effect was observed on PMA-induced NF-κB-dependent transcription, suggesting that that proteasome degradation does not play a role in this pathway. Role of Protein Kinase A and Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase in NF-κB-dependent Transcription—As both the PKA and PI3K pathways have been implicated in the activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription (see Ref. 2Schmitz M.L. Bacher S. Kracht M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 186-190Google Scholar and references therein), we tested the effect H-89, a potent inhibitor of PKA, and wortmannin and LY294002, both potent inhibitors of PI3K. Whereas, the PKC inhibitor, Ro 31-8220, was effective at inhibiting either TNFα- or PMA-mediated NF-κB-dependent transcription between 10-7 and 10-6m (EC50 values 1.53 10-7m and 4.63 10-7m, respectively), H-89 was at least 10–100-fold less effective with the respective EC50 values lying between 10-4 and 10-5m (Fig. 3C). As the Ki value for H-89 on PKA is around 48 nm, and this drug is known to inhibit PKC"
https://openalex.org/W2113170542,"CD20 is a B cell-specific membrane protein that functions in store-operated calcium entry and serves as a useful target for antibody-mediated therapeutic depletion of B cells. Antibody binding to CD20 induces a diversity of biological effects, some of which are dependent on lipid rafts. Rafts are isolated as low density detergent-resistant membranes, initially characterized using Triton X-100. We have previously reported that CD20 is soluble in 1% Triton but that antibodies induce the association of CD20 with Triton-resistant rafts. However, by using several other detergents to isolate rafts and by microscopic co-localization with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein, we show in this report that CD20 is constitutively raft-associated. CD20 was distributed in a punctate pattern on the cell surface as visualized by fluorescence imaging and was also localized to microvilli by electron microscopy. The mechanism underlying antibody-induced association of CD20 with Triton-resistant rafts was investigated and found not to require cellular ATP, kinase activity, actin polymerization, or antibody cross-linking but was dependent on the epitope recognized. Thus, antibody-induced insolubility in 1% Triton most likely reflects a transition from relatively weak to strong raft association that occurs as a result of a conformational change in the CD20 protein.

CD20 is also an effective target for in vivo depletion of malignant or autoimmune B cells using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which can activate apoptotic signaling pathways and mediate complement-mediated cytoxicity potentially through mechanisms involving cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts (2Deans J.P.

Blood. 2003; 101: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Rafts are thought to function in part as platforms for signaling from those receptors with properties that allow their access to the tightly packed lipid raft environment, which otherwise excludes most membrane proteins (5Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar, 6Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

The operational criteria for assigning raft association of a protein are insolubility in nonionic detergents and buoyancy on density gradients. The detergent best characterized for raft isolation is Triton X-100, and we showed previously that antibodies induce translocation of CD20 from the soluble fraction of Triton X-100 cell lysates into the buoyant insoluble fraction, consistent with its induced association with rafts (8Deans J.P. Robbins S.M. Polyak M.J. Savage J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 344-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, raft association of some proteins can only be demonstrated using very low concentrations of Triton X-100 or other nonionic detergents (9Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 10Hostager B.S. Catlett I.M. Bishop G.A. J. Biol.

A. 2003; Google Scholar), and we recently found that unligated CD20, although soluble in 1% Triton X-100, was insoluble in 1% Brij 58 (1Li H. Ayer L.M. Lytton J. Deans J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42427-42434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Brij 58-insoluble CD20 localized to cholesterol-dependent, buoyant fractions on sucrose density gradients. Importantly, deletion of a short membrane-proximal cytoplasmic sequence, previously shown to be essential for efficient translocation into Triton-resistant rafts (12Polyak M.J. Tailor S.H. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3242-3248PubMed Google Scholar), also prevented the constitutive association of CD20 with Brij 58 buoyant fractions. CD20 thus appears to be an example of a raft-associated protein that is Triton-soluble. What, then, is the meaning of antibody-induced translocation into Triton-resistant rafts? Here, we first extend our observations on the constitutive nature of CD20-raft association and then explore the effects of antibody ligation on cell surface distribution and mechanisms of antibody-induced Triton-insolubility of CD20.Our results show that antibody binding does not induce a detectable alteration in cell surface distribution of CD20, which in the absence of antibody binding is already distributed unevenly on the B cell surface. Transmission electron microscopy (EM) demonstrated that CD20 was localized to membrane protrusions, or microvilli. Anti-CD20 mAbs differ dramatically in their ability to induce Triton insolubility of CD20, and we show here that these differences cannot be attributed to the antibody isotype or to the amount of antibody bound per cell but are epitope-dependent. Translocation into Triton-resistant rafts is shown to be independent of the availability of ATP, kinase activity, actin polymerization, and the cross-linking effects of antibodies. Together, these data are consistent with the interpretation that CD20 is constitutively associated with lipid rafts on microvilli and that antibody engagement increases the affinity of the association through an intrinsic mechanism, such as a conformational change in the CD20 protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells—Ramos and BJAB B cells were maintained in culture in RPMI 1640 plus 7.5% fetal bovine serum. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from whole blood using lymphocyte separation medium (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH). Stable transfectants of BJAB cells expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP)-CD20 were generated by electroporation at 250 V and 500 microfarads (Gene Pulser II; Bio-Rad) with 30 μg of DNA. GFP was fused to the amino terminus of CD20 by inserting human CD20 cDNA into the cloning site of the pEGFP expression vector (Clontech) using XhoI/SacII. CD20-positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry (FACStar cytometer; BD Biosciences) and maintained with Geneticin (Invitrogen) at 1 mg/ml.Antibodies and Reagents—Monoclonal antibodies 2H7 (IgG2b anti-CD20) and 9.4 (IgG2b anti-CD45) were provided by Dr. J. Ledbetter (Seattle, WA), and the isotype switch variants of NK1.B20 were provided by Dr. Anne-Marie Hekman (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam) (13Hooijberg E. Sein J.J. van den Berk P.C. Hekman A. Hybridoma. 1996; 15: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). B1 (IgG2a anti-CD20) was purchased from Coulter (Hialeah, FL). Anti-CD59 antibody (MEM43/5) was purchased from Sanbio (Uden, The Netherlands). 2H7 and B1 were conjugated to Alexa 488 (A488) using the Alexa Fluor 488 protein labeling kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Cy3 was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) and rabbit anti-CTB were purchased from Sigma. For immunoblotting, anti-Gαi antibody was purchased from Oncogene (Boston, MA), anti-Lyn from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-actin from Roche Applied Science, and anti-CD45 antibody from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit antiserum directed against a CD20 cytoplasmic region peptide was generated as described (14Petrie R.J. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase conjugates of Protein A, rabbit anti-mouse IgG, and CTB were purchased from Bio-Rad, Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL), and Sigma, respectively.Fab fragments of 2H7 were produced using the ImmunoPure Fab preparation kit (Pierce). Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE separation of titrated 2H7 mAb, both intact and digested, followed by Western blot using biotin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG2b detected with avidin-horseradish peroxidase (both reagents from Southern Biotechnology Associates). The limit of detection of intact 2H7 mAb was 1 ng. The initial Fab preparation was contaminated with ∼1 ng of intact mAb/μg of protein; however, after two additional clearance steps with protein A-Sepharose, there was no detectable intact mAb in 5 μg of Fab protein.Triton X-100 and CHAPS were purchased from Pierce. Thesit, Brij 35, Brij 58, and Brij 96 were purchased from Sigma. Glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide were from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Fort Washington, PA) and paraformaldehyde (PFA) from BDH Chemicals.Rafts Isolations and Immunoblots—Cell lysis in detergents (all used at 1%, except Triton X-100, which was also used at 0.05%) and sucrose density gradient centrifugation were done with slight modifications of the protocol previously described (8Deans J.P. Robbins S.M. Polyak M.J. Savage J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 344-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, 108 cells were washed and then lysed for 15 min in ice-cold lysis buffer of detergent in MBS (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl) containing enzyme inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm NaMoO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA). Lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in MBS plus inhibitors, overlayered with 5 ml of 30% and 5 ml of 5% sucrose in MBS plus inhibitors, and then centrifuged at 235,000 × g for 17 h. From the top of the gradients, eight 1.5-ml fractions were collected on ice. Sample preparation for CD20 translocation experiments was as described (8Deans J.P. Robbins S.M. Polyak M.J. Savage J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 344-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation with antibodies, the cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 and separated into soluble and insoluble fractions by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 × g.For GM1 dot blots, nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) were spotted with equal cell equivalents from each gradient fraction. For immunoblots, equal cell equivalents from each gradient fraction were mixed with SDS sample buffer, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). All membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin. CTB-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) was used to detect GM1. Other blots were performed as described (8Deans J.P. Robbins S.M. Polyak M.J. Savage J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 344-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). All blots were developed using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and visualized using the Fluor-S Max (Bio-Rad) imaging system. Quantity One software was used to quantitate the signal.Flow Cytometry—Cells were incubated with anti-CD20 mAb, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The data were acquired using a Becton Dickinson FACScan (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using the FlowJo program (Tree Star, Inc., San Carlos, CA).Immunofluorescence Imaging—Cells were fixed in 1% PFA at room temperature for 5 min and then incubated with antibody as indicated or incubated with antibody prior to fixation. Fixed and unfixed PBMC (106) were incubated with 1 μg of 2H7-A488 in 100 μl of PBS at 37 °C for 15 min. Fixed Ramos B cells were incubated with B1- or 2H7-A488 (1 μg/106 cells) for 30 min at 37 °C; unfixed Ramos cells were incubated with the same antibodies for 10 min at 37 °C, washed, and fixed. For colocalization studies, 106 BJAB (GFP-CD20) cells were fixed in 1% PFA; incubated with anti-CD59, anti-CD20, or anti-CD45; washed; and further incubated with anti-mouse IgG-Cy3.Fluorescence imaging was done with a Leica DM RXA microscope attached to a 14-bit cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Monmouth Junction, NJ). Digital deconvolution was performed using the MicroTome software (VayTek, Fairfield, IA). In some experiments, imaging of PBMC was with DeltaVision Image Restoration Microscopy System (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA).Electron Microscopy—For transmission EM, Ramos cells (1 × 107) were incubated with mouse IgG anti-CD20 (15 μg in 500 μl of PBS), washed in PBS, and then incubated in colloidal gold (6 nm)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Electron Microscopy Sciences). After washing, the cells were fixed in cold 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS with rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing three times (20 min each) with the same buffer, the cells were pelleted and embedded in 3% agar. The agarized pellet was cut into 1-mm slices and immersed in 1% osmium tetroxide in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The pellets were rinsed in distilled water, dehydrated in graded ethanol series, and embedded in Epon 812. Thin sections were cut with a diamond knife, mounted on naked copper grids, and viewed with a Hitachi (Schaumburg, IL) H-7000 transmission electron microscope.For scanning EM, Ramos cells (1 × 107) were fixed in cold 1% glutaraldehyde/PBS with rotation at 4 °C for 1 h, washed three times in PBS, and dehydrated in graded ethanol series. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of 100% ethanol and transferred to a poly-l-lysine-coated coverslip for critical point drying. Coverslips were then sputter-coated with gold palladium, dried, and mounted on the sample stage of a Philips XL30 scanning electron microscope (FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR).RESULTSCD20 Is Constitutively Associated with Membrane Rafts—To test whether the use of detergents other than Triton X-100 might reveal a significant presence of CD20 in rafts in the absence of antibody engagement, Ramos B cells were lysed in the series of detergents indicated in Fig. 1. After sucrose density gradient centrifugation, fractions were tested by immunoblot for the presence of CD20. As controls, the gradient fractions were also blotted for actin, raft markers GM1 and Gαi, and nonraft marker CD45. CD20 was solubilized by Triton X-100 at 1%, as expected. However, in 0.05% Triton and in all other detergents except Brij 96, 30–80% of CD20 redistributed to the buoyant raft fractions 3–5. Glycosphinglipid GM1 localized to the raft fractions in all detergents. The acylated heteromeric G protein subunit Gαi was found predominantly in the raft fractions in all detergents except Brij 96. The distribution of actin was similar in all gradients. CD45, an abundant nonraft protein, was not detected in the raft fractions in any detergent, indicating selectivity of the isolations.Brij 58 and Brij 35 extracted the most CD20 into raft fractions. To further assess the distribution of plasma membrane-associated proteins in Brij 58 gradients, Ramos or BJAB B cells were surface-labeled with biotin before lysis, and fractions from the gradients were probed by Western blot with avidin-horseradish peroxidase. Results from BJAB cells are shown in Fig. 2; similar data were obtained with Ramos. Proteins found in raft fractions 3–5 appeared to include a distinct subset and represented ∼30% of all surface-labeled proteins, as estimated by densitometry analysis (Fig. 2, A, left panel, and B). After pretreatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBC), <13% of surface-labeled proteins were detected in fractions 3–5 (Fig. 2, A, right panel and B), demonstrating the cholesterol dependence expected of most protein-raft associations. The buoyancy of both CD20 and Gαi on Brij 58 gradients was sensitive to cellular pretreatment with MBC and was restored by subsequent incubation with cholesterol-loaded MBC (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the buoyancy of GM1 was less dependent on cholesterol. Quantitative analysis showed that the amount of GM1 in rafts (fractions 3–5) was reduced less than 20% by MBC treatment compared with more than 95 and 90% reduction for CD20 and Gαi, respectively.Fig. 2Cholesterol dependence of CD20-raft association. A, BJAB cells were surface-labeled with biotin and incubated in the absence or presence of 2% MBC for 30 min before lysis in Brij 58. Lysates were fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and fractions were analyzed by blotting with avidin-horseradish peroxidase. Similar data were obtained using Ramos cells. B, the percentage of biotinylated proteins in each fraction was estimated using Quantity One software. Data are the average ± S.E. from three experiments. C, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of MBC. Samples after MBC treatment were followed by further incubation with 2% cholesterol-loaded MBC for 30 min, as indicated. The cells were then lysed in Brij 58 and fractionated on sucrose density gradients. Fractions were immunoblotted for CD20, Gαi, and GM1 as indicated. Data shown are representative of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cell Surface Distribution of CD20 and Colocalization with Raft Marker CD59 —Since constitutive raft association of CD20 was shown in the above experiments, we examined its cell surface distribution before and after ligation with mAb 2H7, which induces 95% of CD20 protein to become insoluble in 1% Triton X-100 (8Deans J.P. Robbins S.M. Polyak M.J. Savage J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 344-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Polyak M.J. Tailor S.H. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3242-3248PubMed Google Scholar). For these experiments, we used peripheral blood B cells (Fig. 3A), Ramos cells (Fig. 3, B and C), and BJAB cells transfected with a GFP-CD20 construct (Fig. 3, E and F), and results obtained with all three B cell sources were concordant. The pattern of CD20 staining on cells that were fixed prior to labeling was similar to that observed when cells were fixed after incubation with the 2H7 mAb (Fig. 3A). There was no apparent large scale change in the distribution of CD20 after antibody binding. CD20 was not evenly distributed around the membrane but was somewhat punctate. Similar data were obtained when cells were fixed with higher concentrations of PFA and/or in the presence of glutaraldehyde (data not shown) and also when CD20 was labeled with fluorochrome-conjugated highly purified Fab fragments of 2H7 to exclude cross-linking effects (Fig. 3B). Cell surface distribution of CD20 was not different when CD20 was ligated and labeled with B1 mAb, which induces minimal (<5%) Triton insolubility of CD20 (8Deans J.P. Robbins S.M. Polyak M.J.

Blood. 2002; 99: 3256-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (see below), compared with 2H7 (Fig. 3C). We expressed a GFP-CD20 construct in BJAB cells in order to observe the distribution of CD20 in the absence of antibody binding. The GFP-CD20 chimera distributed similarly to endogenous CD20 on sucrose density gradients prepared from Brij 58 lysates (Fig. 3D) and the distribution pattern of GFP-CD20 at the cell surface was similar whether the cells were untreated or pretreated with 2H7 or B1 mAb (Fig. 3E). To further assess the constitutive localization of CD20 in lipid rafts, we used fluorescence microscopy to examine the relative distribution of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked raft protein, CD59. BJAB cells expressing GFP-CD20 were fixed and then labeled with anti-CD59 and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. When the GFP signal was merged with the Cy3 signal, yellow color indicated areas of colocalization (Fig. 3F). In contrast, no colocalization with CD45 was evident.Fig. 3Cell surface distribution of CD20 and colocalization with raft marker CD59. A, PBMC were fixed with 1% PFA, incubated with A488-conjugated 2H7 (top panel), or incubated with A488–2H7 at 37 °C for 15 min and then fixed (lower panel). Images shown are deconvolved optical sections near the middle and top of the cells and three-dimensional reconstructions of all deconvolved sections through the cells, as indicated. B, Ramos cells were fixed and then labeled with A488-conjugated Fab fragments of 2H7 or A488–2H7 mAb as indicated. C, Ramos cells were fixed with 1% PFA, stained with B1-A488 or 2H7-A488 (left panels), or incubated at 37 °C with the same antibodies and then fixed (right panels). D, BJAB cells stably transfected with GFP-CD20 were lysed in 1% Brij 58 and fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Fractions were probed by anti-CD20 immunoblot. E, GFP-CD20-transfected BJAB cells were incubated at 37 °C without antibody or with 2H7 or B1 mAbs as indicated. F, GFP-CD20 BJAB cells were incubated with anti-CD59 or anti-CD45 antibodies, and bound antibodies were visualized with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody. Images separately acquired using GFP (λex/λem = 470/525) and Cy3 (λex/λem = 535/610) filter combinations were deconvolved and merged. Yellow indicates areas of overlapping distribution.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)CD20 Is Localized to Microvilli—In three-dimensional reconstructions of deconvolved optical sections such as those shown in fig. 3A, it appeared that CD20 staining was clustered on membrane protrusions. To examine this at higher resolution, Ramos B cells were labeled with CD20 mAb and gold-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and prepared for transmission EM. A grid was placed over each of 39 images derived from different cells in two experiments, and gold particles associated with membrane protrusions or with the flat continuous part of the plasma membrane were enumerated. Among a total of 656 particles counted, 591 (>90%) were associated with membrane protrusions. A representative image is shown in Fig. 4; low magnification of transmission and scanning EM images of Ramos B cells in the lower panels of Fig. 4 illustrate the gross plasma membrane architecture of these cells, which is similar to that reported previously for primary B cells (16Perkins W.D.

No gold particles were observed in isotype control samples (data not shown).Fig. 4CD20 is localized to microvilli. Ramos cells were labeled with 2H7 anti-CD20 or isotype control and gold (6 nm)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and then prepared for transmission EM (upper image; scale bar, 200 nm). Similar results were obtained after labeling with B1 anti-CD20, and no gold particles were observed in the isotype controls (data not shown). A low magnification transmission EM image is shown in the lower left (scale bar, 2 μm), and a scanning EM image is shown in the lower right (scale bar, 2 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Antibody-induced Insolubility in 1% Triton—Although unligated CD20 is soluble in 1% Triton, antibody binding can induce almost complete insolubility of CD20 in this detergent (8Deans J.P. Robbins S.M. Polyak M.J. Savage J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 344-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 5A). Antibody-ligated Triton-insoluble CD20 was found in the low density region of sucrose gradients and not in the high density pellet (Fig. 5A, fraction P). The buoyancy of ligated Triton-insoluble CD20 was sensitive to cholesterol depletion and restored by subsequent incubation with cholesterol-loaded MBC (Fig. 5A). The distribution of the Src-family kinase Lyn on these gradients is shown for comparison. In light of the constitutive CD20-raft association demonstrated earlier, these data suggest that induced Triton insolubility reflects increased strength of the association with rafts. We then investigated the mechanism underlying this effect using a rapid and sensitive procedure, described previously (12Polyak M.J. Tailor S.H. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3242-3248PubMed Google Scholar), in which the loss of CD20 from the soluble fraction of Triton lysates caused by antibody binding is monitored as well as the corresponding gain of CD20 in the insoluble material obtained after microcentrifugation. To confirm the cholesterol dependence of CD20 insolubility using this procedure, Ramos B cells were pretreated with MBC before the addition of 2H7 anti-CD20 mAb. Both soluble and insoluble fractions were collected and probed for the presence of CD20 (Fig. 5B). As expected, antibody-induced loss of CD20 from the soluble fractions (lane 5) was prevented by preincubation of the cells with MBC (lanes 6–8). The pellet fractions showed the reverse results (i.e. 2H7-induced CD20 Triton-insolubility was prevented by MBC pretreatment).Fig. 5Antibody-induced insolubility of CD20 in 1% Triton. A, untreated, MBC, or cholesterol/MBC-treated Ramos cells were incubated with isotype control or 2H7 mAb before lysis in 1% Triton X-100, fractionated on sucrose density gradients, and immunoblotted for CD20 or Lyn. B, Ramos cells were pretreated with MBC for the times indicated, and then 2H7 anti-CD20 was added for an additional 15 min before lysis in 1% Triton X-100. The soluble and insoluble fractions were collected and probed by immunoblot for CD20. Results are representative of three experiments in A and two experiments in B. For these and similar experiments shown in later figures, equal loading was demonstrated by actin blot or Coomassie Blue staining, but it is not shown for clarity of presentation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Antibody-induced association of CD20 with 1% Triton-resistant rafts could potentially be mediated by the actin cytoskeleton, by signaling events or post-translational modifications, by clustering on a scale that is not obvious at the level of light microscopy, or by a CD20-intrinsic mechanism such as a change in conformation. Cytoskeleton-associated proteins are among the most abundant proteins in membrane rafts (20von Haller P.D. Donohoe S. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Watts J.D. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1010-1021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane skeleton has also been suggested to regulate the size of lipid rafts (21Kusumi A. Sako Y. Curr. Opin.

https://openalex.org/W2034520261,"Liver fibrosis is characterized by an increased deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen type I, by activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Previous studies have shown that this increase is mediated primarily by a post-transcriptional mechanism. In particular, the RNA-binding protein αCP binds to the α1(I) collagen 3′-untranslated region (UTR) and stabilizes this RNA in activated, but not quiescent, HSCs. This study examines the role of αCP in the decay of transcripts containing the collagen 3′-UTR in extracts obtained from NIH fibroblasts and quiescent and activated HSCs. Using an in vitro decay system, αCP binding activity was competed out with the addition of wild type oligonucleotides, but not with mutant oligonucleotides. Competition of αCP binding activity increased the rate of decay of wild type transcripts containing the αCP 3′-UTR binding site, but not of transcripts containing a mutated binding site. Quiescent HSC extracts contain no αCP binding activity and have no difference in the rate of decay of transcripts with wild type and mutant binding sites for αCP. The addition of recombinant αCP was sufficient to increase the half-life of the wild type transcript, whereas that of the mutant transcript was minimally changed. In vitro decay assays performed with activated HSC extracts that contain αCP binding activity demonstrate a markedly reduced decay rate of wild type compared with mutant transcripts. In vivo small interfering RNA experiments targeting αCP showed a reduction of the binding activity of αCP and a concomitant reduction in intracellular levels of α1(I) collagen messenger RNA. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the direct role of αCP in the stabilization of α1(I) collagen messenger RNA by blocking RNA degradation in activated HSCs.

As a general response to most chronic stimuli, HSCs are transformed from a quiescent to that of an activated phenotype (4Aycock R.S. Seyer J.M. Connect.

Isolation of HSCs from normal livers and plating them on plastic results in a spontaneous activation of the HSCs that closely mimics the activation observed in the liver in vivo (6Knittel T.

This culture-induced activation includes an increase in ECM production, including α1(I) collagen, loss of vitamin A stores, increased proliferation rate, and increased expression of smooth muscle α-actin (7de Leeuw A.M. Mccarthy S.P. Geerts A. Knook D.L. Hepatology. 1984; 4: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 8Hendriks H.F. Verhoofstad W.A. Brouwer A. de Leeuw A.M. Knook D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 160: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The increase in α1(I) collagen expression is primarily because of an increase in the half-life of the α1(I) collagen mRNA molecule, from 1.5 h in quiescent HSCs to greater than 24 h in activated HSCs (9Lindquist J.N. Stefanovic B. Brenner D.A. J. Gastroenterol. 2000; 35: 80-83PubMed Google Scholar, 10Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Aliebhaber S. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in α1(I) collagen mRNA stability coincides with an increase in the binding activity of αCP (hnRNP E2, PCBP2) to a C-rich region in the α1(I) collagen 3′-untranslated region (UTR) (10Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Aliebhaber S. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant mRNAs lacking this binding region do not demonstrate increased stability in activated HSCs. αCP binds to the 3′-UTRs of several other mRNAs, including α-globin, tyrosine hydroxylase, and 15-lipoxygenase, suggesting that it may play a regulatory role for multiple mRNAs (11Chkheidze A.N.

The hnRNP family of RNA-binding proteins consists of many members, most of which are alternatively spliced and have several isoforms resulting in a very large family of proteins. They are involved in many different aspects of RNA metabolism, from pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA shuttling to mRNA stability, transcriptional regulation, and translation (16Baber J.L. Libutti D.

Some hnRNP proteins have RNA binding activity regulated directly by specific kinase phosphorylation, suggesting kinases may play important roles in regulating gene transcription or translation in response to certain stimuli (21Mayrand S.H.

The hnRNP family member αCP contains three RNA-binding K domain homology domains and is alternatively spliced to produce several discrete isoforms (24Dejgaard K. Leffers H. Eur. J.

Yeast two-hybrid studies have demonstrated that αCP may form homodimers and have identified other nucleic acid-binding proteins with which it may interact, such as poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) (13Funke B.

Regulated RNA decay can be analyzed in vitro by following a radiolabeled RNA containing the sequence of interest over time in cytoplasmic extracts (26Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell.

Polyadenylated reporter RNAs incubated with cell extracts of interest have been utilized to show the dependence of α-globin mRNA stability to a region in the 3′-UTR of the message (26Wang Z.

To elucidate the role of the 3′-UTR in regulating α1(I) collagen mRNA stability, we measured relative stabilities of RNA transcripts containing wild type (WT) and mutated (MUT) α1(I) collagen 3′-UTRs using both activated and quiescent HSCs extracts. The use of small interfering double-stranded RNAs (siRNAs) is a newly described method for assessing gene function in cell culture models (31Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3973) Google Scholar, 32Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar). siRNAs cause a sequence-specific degradation of messages targeted by the siRNA, effectively down-regulating endogenous gene expression (33Carthew R.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 34Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Hannon G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). To confirm that the in vitro decay assay had in vivo relevance, we used siRNAs to selectively inhibit αCP levels in activated HSCs and observed what effects this had on collagen α1(I) mRNA. This study utilized lysates from quiescent and activated HSCs to demonstrate that the stability of the α1(I) collagen mRNA is directly mediated by binding of αCP to its cognate binding site in the 3′-UTR. Furthermore, selectively inhibiting expression of αCP in rat HSCs resulted in decreased α1(I) collagen mRNA steady state levels, demonstrating a direct role for αCP in the stabilization of α1(I) collagen message in activated HSCs. Cell Culture—NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone). Rat HSCs were isolated as previously described (36Hellerbrand Wang S.C. Tsukamoto H. Brenner D.A. Rippe R.A. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 670-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates—Confluent dishes of cells, either NIH 3T3 or HSCs, were washed one time in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and scraped off the dish. The cells were pelleted at 10,000 × g and incubated in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm potassium acetate, 1.5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μm Na3VO4) on ice and cells lysed with 5-10 strokes using a 1.5-ml pestle (Nalgene 749521-1590). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g and the supernatant collected as cytoplasmic lysates. S100 lysates were generated from the cytoplasmic lysates by centrifugation in a TLS-55 rotor at 100,000 × g for one hour in a Beckman Ti20 tabletop ultracentrifuge. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10% and the samples stored at -80°C. Plasmids and Sequences—The wild type collagen α1(I) 3′-UTR (WT 3′-UTR) (GenBank™ accession number Z78279) was cloned into pBluescript using HindIII and SalI to allow in vitro transcription with the T3 promoter. The mutant 3′-UTR (10Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Aliebhaber S. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that lacks αCP binding capability was cloned into the same site to generate the MUT3′-UTR transcript. The addition of 50 adenosines to the end of the 3′-UTR was performed essentially as previously described (27Ford L.P. Wilusz J. Methods. 1999; 17: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide containing the poly()A sequence was ligated into the digested pBluescript-3′-UTR vector at the SalI and a blunted XhoI site and the plasmid DNA transformed into competent DH5α Escherichia coli. Transcripts and Probes—To generate capped and radiolabeled probes from WT 3′-UTR and MUT 3′-UTR, mCAP analog (Stratagene) was added to an in vitro transcription reaction containing 1 μg of NSI linearized plasmid, 50 units of RNasin (Promega), 250 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm CTP, 0.3 mm GTP, 0.25 mm UTP with 0.06 μCi of [32P]UTP and 20 units of T3 RNA polymerase. Probes were purified in a 4% acrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and radiolabeled bands excised from the gel and extracted in stop solution (400 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% SDS). Oligonucleotides were radiolabeled using 3 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml) and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase with standard protocols (37Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). In Vitro Decay Assay—In vitro decay assays were performed essentially as previously described (27Ford L.P. Wilusz J. Methods. 1999; 17: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, the decay reaction was performed in a 40-μl reaction volume containing 1 μg/μl S100 lysate and 40,000 cpm radiolabeled probe and 20,000 cpm of a radiolabeled 87-mer oligonucleotide as a control for loading and pipetting. Time points were taken at the indicated times and immediately added to a 300-μl stop solution (see above), and 5 μg of yeast tRNA was added. The reaction mixture was layered on top of 300 μl of water-equilibrated phenol and the entire mixture immediately vortexed. After 5 min of centrifugation (16,000 × g), the aqueous phase was collected and the RNA precipitated with 2 volumes of 95% ethanol. RNA was suspended in 7 μl of formamide running dye and run on a 4% acrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. Recombinant Proteins—The recombinant GST-αCP2 was generated as described (38Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 39Lindquist J.N. Kauschke S.G. Stefanovic B. Burchardt E.R. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4306-4316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-αCP2 was expressed from the pGEX-3X plasmid in DH5α E. coli by induction with 0.1 m isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h prior to purification. Recombinant protein was purified after cell lysis with the addition of 500 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and recombinant protein eluted using 50 mm reduced glutathione in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl2. Quantitation of Results—The amount of radioactive probe at the different time points was quantitated using the PhosphorImager software, ImageQuant 5.2. The zero time point was defined as 100% of the probe, and lanes were standardized for loading and/or precipitation variation by normalizing to the amount of the radiolabeled 87-mer oligonucleotide in the reaction. All experiments were repeated at least three times. RNA Isolation—Total cellular RNA from HSCs was isolated as previously described (36Hellerbrand Wang S.C. Tsukamoto H. Brenner D.A. Rippe R.A. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 670-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). siRNA—siRNAs (Table I) were synthesized using the Ambion Silencer siRNA kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cy3-Luc siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). HSCs were transfected with 100 pmol siRNA/well in 6-well dishes with 2 μl of LipofectAMINE in a total volume of 1 ml following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Cells were analyzed 72 h later after harvesting RNA or cellular extracts as described above.Table ISequences of oligonucleotides used to synthesize siRNA 5′ to 3′Cy3-Luc-SCy3-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAdTdTCy3-Luc-ASUCGAAGUAUUCCGCGUACGdTdTsiA1-SGGTGGATTAAATGTCACCTTsiA1-ASGAGUGACAUUUAAUCCACCUUsiA2-SAUGUCACUCUCACCAUCAGUUsiA2-ASCUGAUGGUGAGAGUGACAUUUsiA3-SAGGAAGUUGGCAGUAUCAUUUsiA3-ASAUGAUACUGCCAACUUCCUUUsiA4-SGUUGGCAGUAUCAUCGGAAUUsiA4-ASUUCCGAUGAUACUGCCAACUU Open table in a new tab Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as previously described (39Lindquist J.N. Kauschke S.G. Stefanovic B. Burchardt E.R. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4306-4316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of cytoplasmic lysates were incubated in a binding buffer (12.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 15 mm KCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml tRNA, 50 units/ml RNasin, 10% glycerol) with 10,000 cpm of probe for 30 min on ice. Binding reactions were electro-phoresed in 6% native gels at 250 V, gels dried, and signals quantitated by PhosphoImager analysis using ImageQuant 5.2 software (Amer-sham Biosciences). Mixing EMSAs included 10 μg of activated HSC extracts incubated with either 10 μg of quiescent extracts or 10 μg bovine serum albumin as a negative control. Western Blotting—Cell lysates were prepared as described above. Lysates were supplemented with SDS loading buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose. Blots were incubated with 5% BLOTTO (TBST + 5% nonfat dry milk) and incubated with anti-αCP antibodies. αCP antibodies were a generous gift from M. Kiledjian. Validation of RNA in Vitro Decay Assay (IVDA) in NIH Cells—To study the factors involved in α1(I) collagen mRNA degradation, we utilized radiolabeled 7mG-capped and polyadenylated transcripts as RNA substrate and cytosolic S100 protein extracts in reaction mixtures (40McCarthy J.E. Kollmus H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 41Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our initial studies to investigate a regulated decay of the collagen 3′-UTR (WT 3′-UTR) utilized extracts from NIH 3T3 cells that express type I collagen and exhibit the same binding activity seen in activated HSCs (Fig. 1, lane 5). Extracts from NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1, lane 2) and activated HSCs (lanes 4 and 5) HSC, but not quiescent HSCs (lane 3), have binding activity for the collagen 3′-UTR. This binding activity has previously been identified as αCP using supershift assays with αCP-specific antibodies (39Lindquist J.N. Kauschke S.G. Stefanovic B. Burchardt E.R. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4306-4316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether RNA decay occurred via a regulated, poly(A)-dependent process in NIH 3T3 extracts, an in vitro decay assay containing increasing amounts of unlabeled poly(A) homopolymers was performed. The addition of excess cold poly(A) homopolymers to the reactions will increase the decay rate if decay occurs by a poly(A)-dependent process (26Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6334-6341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 30Wang Z. Day N. Trifillis P. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The addition of increasing amounts of poly(A) homopolymers increased the rate of decay of the WT probe (Fig. 2A, lanes 3-5), whereas addition of other poly(U) had little effect on the rate of decay (Fig. 2A, lane 6), thus confirming a poly(A)-dependent process. Having established that the decay reactions occurred via a poly(A)-dependent process, we investigated whether the ability of the RNA probe to be bound by αCP had any effect on the rate of decay in the NIH extracts. The decay rates of the WT probe, which αCP binds, and the MUT probe, which αCP fails to bind when using NIH 3T3 extracts, demonstrated an 11-fold increase in stability at 60 min of the WT probe compared with the MUT probe (Fig. 2B). Thus, αCP, either alone or in a complex, is capable of stabilizing the transcript in NIH extracts. Our data of the α1(I) collagen 3′-UTR is consistent with that described for the α-globin mRNA and provides the first evidence that αCP can directly stabilize the α1(I) collagen 3′-UTR. Competition of αCP Binding Decreases WT Transcript Stability—To confirm that αCP binding to the α1(I) collagen 3′-UTR RNA probe inhibits the decay of the mRNA, competition studies were performed using an unlabeled consensus binding sequence oligonucleotide (WT-oligo) for αCP. By conducting the IVDA under conditions where αCP binding is abolished by the addition of unlabeled WT-oligo, we observed an increase in the decay rate of the WT 3′-UTR transcript to a rate very similar to the MUT 3′-UTR transcript (Fig. 2, C and D). The addition of a mutant oligonucleotide (MUT-oligo) of the same size incapable of binding αCP had no effect on the decay rate of the WT 3′-UTR (Fig. 2, C and D). Interestingly, the control reaction using the MUT 3′-UTR probe lacking the αCP binding site also showed a slight increase in the rate of decay with the unlabeled WT-oligo competitor, but not the unlabeled MUT-oligo competitor (Fig. 2C). This may reflect αCP sequestering PABP from the transcript because of a direct interaction of PABP with αCP (26Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell.

Together these data confirm that αCP binding to the α1(I) collagen 3′-UTR transcript confers stability in a sequence-specific manner. Decay of WT and MUT Transcripts Are Identical in Quiescent HSCs Extracts—Having determined that the in vitro decay reactions recapitulate in vivo RNA poly(A)-dependent decay, the stability of WT and MUT transcripts was investigated in lysates from quiescent HSC extracts. These extracts lack detectable αCP binding activity (Fig. 1) despite expression of αCP protein (10Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Aliebhaber S. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If αCP binding activity is required to stabilize the collagen mRNA via the 3′-UTR, then the decay rates of the WT and MUT 3′-UTR transcripts should be similar in these extracts. As predicted, the WT 3′-UTR (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-6) and the MUT 3′-UTR (lanes 7-12) displayed almost identical decay rates using these extracts. This demonstrates the requirement that αCP bind to the WT 3′-UTR to stabilize the transcript, as observed in NIH extracts (Fig. 2B). WT Transcripts Are Stabilized in Activated HSCs—To examine whether a difference exists in decay rates between the WT and MUT 3′-UTR transcripts in activated HSCs, IVDAs were performed using extracts obtained from day 14 culture-activated HSCs. A significant increase in the stability of the WT transcript was observed compared with the MUT transcript (Fig. 3B, lanes 1-6 and 7-12). Recombinant αCP Increases Stability of WT Transcripts—To determine whether αCP specifically increases the stability of the WT 3′-UTR transcripts, recombinant αCP was added to the IVDA reactions using quiescent HSC extracts that do not contain an endogenous αCP binding activity (Fig. 1). Recombinant αCP stabilized the WT 3′-UTR transcript but failed to affect the stability of the WT 3′-UTR transcript (Fig. 4). The substantial increase in the WT but not MUT transcript indicates a direct role for the binding of αCP in stabilizing the α1(I) collagen 3′-UTR. Inhibition of Endogenous αCP Expression Decreases α1(I) Collagen mRNA Levels—To investigate the role of αCP in vivo, siRNAs targeting the rat αCP mRNA (Table I) were transiently transfected into Rat1 fibroblasts, cells that express α1(I) collagen and possess αCP binding activity. Binding of the αCP protein, as assessed by EMSA, was inhibited ∼30% by addition of siRNA against αCP compared with a control siRNA (Fig. 5A). Because the siRNA decreases the binding activity of αCP, we wanted to assess the effects of inhibiting αCP binding activity on the steady state levels of the α1(I) collagen mRNA. Steady state levels of α1(I) collagen mRNA were reduced ∼60% in cells transiently transfected with αCP siRNA compared with control siRNA as determined by RNase protection assay (Fig. 5B). There was no change in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels. These data corroborate the role of αCP in stabilizing the α1(I) collagen mRNA. To examine the effects of inhibiting αCP expression in HSCs, we transfected siRNAs against αCP into culture-activated HSCs and assessed αCP binding by EMSA. A decrease of 30-40% in αCP binding activity was observed in HSCs transfected with siRNAs targeting αCP compared with control siRNAs (Fig. 5C). We again examined the steady state levels of α1(I) collagen mRNA in HSCs transfected with siRNAs against αCP and observed a 50-60% decrease in the steady state α1(I) collagen mRNA levels (Fig. 5D). Together, these experiments demonstrate that αCP interaction with the α1(I) collagen mRNA 3′-UTR increases stability of the mRNA molecule in activated HSCs. Endogenous Regulation of αCP in HSCs—To investigate the mechanism of αCP binding regulation during HSC activation, we examined the cellular distribution of αCP protein in quiescent and activated HSCs. In quiescent HSC lysates, αCP was located primarily in the nuclear fraction with very low αCP protein levels observed in the cytoplasmic fraction. However, in the activated HSC extracts the total amount of αCP protein expression increased and exhibited a relocalization of αCP to the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 6A). Thus, activated HSCs contain higher αCP protein levels, and the αCP protein demonstrates a markedly different distribution. For comparison, the binding activity of PABP was similar in extracts from quiescent and activated HSCs (data not shown). To determine whether the lack of binding activity observed in quiescent HSCs is solely because of low levels of protein expression in the cytoplasm or whether there is active repression of αCP binding in the quiescent HSCs, we examined binding activity in mixed extracts. Incubation of activated HSC extracts with equal amounts of bovine serum albumin had no effect on the observed binding activity. However, the addition of equal amounts of quiescent HSC extracts reduced the binding activity of the activated HSC extracts by 50% in the cytoplasmic extracts. (Fig. 6B.) In the nuclear fractions, the binding activity was not affected significantly. Culture-induced activation of HSCs is accompanied by an ∼50-fold increase in the steady state levels of α1(I) collagen mRNA (10Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Aliebhaber S. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Brenner D.A. Veloz L. Jaenisch R. Alcorn J.M. Hepatology. 1993; 17: 287-292PubMed Google Scholar). This dramatic increase results primarily from an increase in the half-life of the α1(I) collagen mRNA from 1.5 to >24 h. The increased half-life of the α1(I) collagen mRNA correlates with increased binding activity of αCP to the α1(I) collagen 3′-UTR following HSC activation (10Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Aliebhaber S. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that αCP plays a direct role in stabilizing of the α1(I) collagen mRNA in activated, but not quiescent, HSCs. Utilizing IVDAs, proteins can be assessed for their role in mRNA degradation or stabilization. RNAs that only differ in their αCP binding sites display different decay rates with NIH 3T3 cell extracts, supporting a role for αCP in mRNA decay. Competition of αCP binding using an unlabeled WT-oligo results in a rapid decay of transcripts containing a WT αCP binding site, confirming a direct role of αCP in mRNA decay. We investigated the role of αCP in the differential regulation of α1(I) collagen mRNA expression in quiescent and activated HSCs. Quiescent HSCs express only trace amounts of type I collagen, the α1(I) collagen mRNA has a short half-life, and the cells contain no detectable αCP binding activity (2Friedman S.L. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1999; 23: 904-910PubMed Google Scholar, 5Safadi R. Friedman S.L. MedGenMed. 2002; 4: 27PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hellerbrand Wang S.C. Tsukamoto H. Brenner D.A. Rippe R.A. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 670-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Lindquist J.N. Kauschke S.G. Stefanovic B. Burchardt E.R. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4306-4316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decay rates with quiescent extracts for WT and MUT 3′-UTR RNA are nearly identical, as expected in extract that lack αCP binding activity. However, when WT and MUT 3′-UTR RNAs were incubated with lysates from activated HSCs, which produce collagen, have a long half-life of the α1(I) collagen mRNA, and contain αCP binding activity, a significant decrease in the decay rate was observed. This suggests that αCP binding activity is responsible for stabilizing the α1(I) collagen mRNA by the 3′-UTR in activated HSCs. Although different extracts cannot be directly compared, the relative rate of decay of different transcripts in the same extract provides comparison of the specificity and rate of decay because preparation variables are not a factor. Therefore, binding activity of αCP present in activated, but not quiescent HSCs, contributes to the dramatic increase of the collagen mRNA half-life. As a further approach to assess the role of αCP binding in stabilizing the α1(I) collagen mRNA, siRNA technology was utilized. αCP binding activity was decreased by ∼40% in activated HSCs transfected with siRNA, whereas a control siRNA had no effect on αCP binding activity. This reduction of αCP binding activity resulted in decreased steady state mRNA levels of α1(I) collagen, whereas cells treated with control siRNAs did not. These data demonstrate that the increased αCP binding activity in activated HSCs is responsible for increasing α1(I) collagen mRNA stability resulting in elevated steady state mRNA levels. αCP protein is redistributed from primarily a nuclear localization to distribution to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus during HSC activation. This distribution allows αCP to bind to the collagen α1(I) 3′-UTR and protect the mRNA from degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that the quiescent HSC cytoplasm contains an inhibitory activity that affects αCP binding activity in activated cytoplasmic extracts. On the other hand, we were unable to detect any post-translational changes in αCP to explain the differences in binding activity, such as phosphorylation, methylation, or acetylation (data not shown). Based on our previous (10Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Aliebhaber S. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Lindquist J.N.

Chem. 2003; 278: 927-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and current studies, our current model (Fig. 7) of α1(I) collagen mRNA regulation in activated and quiescent HSCs involves αCP as a key component in a multilayered regulation process. The role of PABP on general mRNA turnover is well established, and evidence exists that PABP interacts with αCP, increasing the affinity of both proteins for RNA (30Wang Z. Day N. Trifillis P. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In activated HSCs, αCP binds and together with PABP stabilizes the 3′-UTR complex and prevents loading of the degradosome, a protein complex that degrades cellular RNAs, onto the α1(I) collagen mRNA. We have also shown that a conserved 5′-stem loop structure in the α1(I) collagen mRNA interacts with an unidentified binding activity in activated HSCs (43Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4334-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Stefanovic B. Lindquist J. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 641-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This 5′-stem loop inhibits mRNA stability and translation, while its inhibition is diminished by the αCP binding (45Stefanovic B. Schnabl B. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18229-18237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 46Stefanovic B. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 927-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We speculate that the 5′-binding protein can interact with either αCP or PABP to facilitate circularizing the mRNA and increasing translation efficiency as well as protecting the mRNA from degradation machinery. In this model, αCP binding would stabilize the mRNA in a dual manner: αCP increases binding of PABP to the poly(A) tail and also interacts with the 5′-stem loop protein(s). Quiescent HSCs do not have αCP binding activity. Therefore, PABP is not stabilized, there is no interaction with the 5′-stem loop, and the mRNA molecule is rapidly degraded. Upon HSC activation, however, αCP binds to the 3′-UTR and interacts with PABP and/or proteins binding to the 5′-stem loop, resulting in an increase in mRNA half-life, thus allowing for efficient translation (Fig. 7). There are many similarities between the regulation of α1(I) collagen mRNA in activated HSCs and the regulation of α-globin and lipoxygenase mRNAs in erythroid cells and the tyro-sine hydroxylase mRNA in response to hypoxia (17Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2410-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 47Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Bendixen A.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2111-2120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Paulding W.R. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mRNAs form a class of molecules post-transcriptionally regulated via 3′-UTR interactions with protein(s). There are three predominant classes of mRNAs that are regulated by interactions at the 3′-UTR: transcripts containing an AU-rich element (ARE), transcripts containing iron-responsive elements, and transcripts containing polypyrimidine-rich regions in the 3′-UTR. These three classes of mRNAs are regulated by interactions between cis-acting regions in the UTR and trans acting proteins via different mechanisms. Many cell cycle mRNAs contain AREs in their 3′-UTRs and have very short half-lives (17Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2410-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). ARE-containing transcripts interact with two types of proteins that regulate message stability. AUF-1 can bind to the ARE, resulting in a rapid degradation of the transcript (50Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar, 51Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene. 2001; 265: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). This prevents message accumulation and keeps the protein levels low. Alternatively, the ELAV family of proteins can bind to ARE-containing transcripts, resulting in stabilization of the transcript, effectively allowing for a rapid increase in the cellular protein levels (28Ford L.P. Watson J. Keene J.D. Wilusz J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 52Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Gene regulation in response to levels of metabolites allows for subtle changes at the post-transcriptional level to alter gene expression. Genes containing iron-responsive elements are bound by a family of proteins called iron-responsive proteins (IRPs) that recognize the iron-responsive element site under low intracellular iron concentrations. This interaction stabilizes the mRNA and allows for production of the transferrin receptor to transport iron into the cell. As the cellular iron levels increase, the IRPs lose their binding capability and dissociate from the transcript, allowing the transcript to be targeted by degradation machinery. In this manner the cell is able to tightly regulate the amount of gene product in response to the availability of cellular factors (51Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene. 2001; 265: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Another method to regulate gene expression by mRNA stability occurs when certain genes are up-regulated in a sustained fashion during cell differentiation, such as erythroid cell maturation or HSC activation. Certain genes are up-regulated by binding of a nucleic acid-binding protein to a polypyrimidine-rich region in the 3′-UTR. In the α-globin message, αCP binds to a CU-rich region in the 3′-UTR and increases the mRNA stability, allowing for expression from the mRNA for many hours after synthesis (53Kiledjian M. Wang X. Liebhaber S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4357-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Similarly, HSCs dramatically increase the stability of the α1(I) collagen mRNA as the cells undergo cellular activation. αCP binding to a CU-rich region in the 3′-UTR of α1(I) collagen is responsible for increased stability of the α1(I) collagen transcript. During liver fibrosis, quiescent HSCs undergo a phenotypic and genotypic change where they lose vitamin A stores and increase production of extracellular matrix proteins, including α1(I) collagen. Investigating the regulation of type I collagen in this study, we have demonstrated that (i) transcripts are stabilized by the presence of an αCP binding site in activated, but not quiescent HSC extracts; (ii) addition of recombinant αCP restores stability to transcripts containing αCP binding sites in quiescent HSC extracts; (iii) knockdown of endogenous αCP results in decreased αCP binding activity and a corresponding loss of endogenous collagen α1(I) mRNA levels; (iv) the activation of HSCs induces a subcellular redistribution of αCP from primarily nuclear localization in quiescent HSCs to equal cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution in activated HSCs; and (v) there is a soluble, cytoplasmic activity in quiescent HSCs that inhibits the binding activity of endogenously activated αCP. Taken together, this work demonstrates for the first time that αCP binding activity is required for collagen α1(I) mRNA stabilization during HSC activation and that alteration of this activity is sufficient to alter the endogenous collagen α1(I) mRNA levels. Thus, αCP is a potential target for therapy of liver fibrosis. We thank the Center of Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease core facility for HSC isolations."
https://openalex.org/W2073799618,"The calcium-activated chloride channel gene family is clustered in the 1p31 region, which is frequently deleted in sporadic breast cancer. Recent studies have indicated the association of the second member of this gene family (CLCA2) with the development of breast cancer and metastasis. We have now shown the absence of expression of CLCA2 in several breast cancer tumours and cell lines, which confirms the results from other reports. When overexpressed in CLCA2-negative cell lines, their tumorigenicity and metastasis capability were significantly reduced, suggesting a tumour suppressor role for CLCA2 in breast cancer. The mechanisms behind the silencing of CLCA2 in breast cancer, however, have not been elucidated to date. Although we were able to identify CLCA2 mutations in breast cancers, somatic mutations are not the major cause of CLCA2 gene silencing. On the other hand, treatment of breast cancer CLCA2-negative cell lines with demethylating agents was able to restore CLCA2 expression, suggesting an epigenetic inactivation of this gene. Bisulphite-sequencing of the promoter-associated CpG island of the CLCA2 gene in breast tumours demonstrated that the absence of expression in these tumours was caused by hypermethylation of the promoter CpG island. In contrast, in breast cancer cell lines, tumours, and control cell lines that express CLCA2, a much lower level, and often absence, of methylation of the promoter were demonstrated. These findings demonstrate that CLCA2 is frequently inactivated in breast cancer by promoter region hypermethylation, which makes it an excellent candidate for the 1p31 breast cancer tumour suppressor gene."
https://openalex.org/W2072169003,"An understanding of structural and functional constraints on the C-terminal double epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules of merozoite surface protein (MSP)-1 and related proteins is of importance to the development of these molecules as malaria vaccines and drug targets. Using allelic replacement, we show that Plasmodium falciparum parasites can invade erythrocytes and grow efficiently in the absence of an MSP-1 protein with authentic MSP-1 EGF domains. In this mutant parasite line, the MSP-1 EGFs were replaced by the corresponding double EGF module from P. berghei MSP-8, the sequence of which shares only low identity with its MSP-1 counterpart. Hence, the C-terminal EGF domains of at least some Plasmodium surface proteins appear to perform the same function in asexual blood-stage development. Mapping the surface location of the few residues that are common to these functionally complementary EGF modules revealed the presence of a highly conserved pocket of potential functional significance. In contrast to MSP-8, an even more divergent double EGF module, that from the sexual stage protein PbS25, was not capable of complementing MSP-1 EGF function. More surprisingly, two chimeric double EGF modules comprising hybrids of the EGF domains from P. falciparum and P. chabaudi MSP-1 were also not capable of replacing the P. falciparum MSP-1 EGF module. Together, these data suggest that although the MSP-1 EGFs can accommodate extensive sequence diversity, there appear to be constraints that may restrict the simple accumulation of point mutations in the face of immune pressure in the field.

The surface coat of the erythrocyte-invasive form of Plasmodium parasites is comprised of a number of proteins, the most abundant of which appears to be merozoite surface protein (MSP) 1The abbreviations used are: MSP, merozoite surface protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell-sorting. 1The abbreviations used are: MSP, merozoite surface protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell-sorting.-1. This large (∼200-kDa) glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane-anchored protein is processed during invasion, leaving only a C-terminal 19-kDa fragment (MSP-119) associated with parasite membranes in newly invaded erythrocytes (1Blackman M.J. Heidrich H.-G. Donachie S. McBride J.S. Holder A.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). MSP-119 is almost entirely composed of two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. This double EGF module is considered an important target of protective antibodies both in naturally exposed individuals (2Egan A.F. Morris J. Barnish G. Allen S. Greenwood B.M. Kaslow D.C.

Consequently, recombinant proteins incorporating the MSP-119 EGF domains are leading candidates for inclusion in a vaccine for the control of the most important cause of human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum. Despite considerable effort, the biological function of the MSP-1 EGF domains is not yet certain, although recent binding studies argue that MSP-119 mediates binding to band 3 on the surface of human erythrocytes (9Goel V. Li X. Chen H. Liu S. Chishti A. Oh S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Whatever its precise role, we have shown previously that the MSP-1 EGF-like domains are functionally conserved across divergent Plasmodium species. Specifically, in these studies we constructed P. falciparum parasites that are deficient for wild-type MSP-1 and instead express MSP-1 chimeras that incorporate the EGF domains from the rodent malaria P. chabaudi MSP-1 molecule (4O'Donnell R.A. de Koning-Ward T.F.

Med. 2000; 6: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These lines invade and grow normally in human erythrocytes. In a reciprocal approach, we have also shown that the P. falciparum MSP-1 EGF domains can complement the function of the corresponding module in the rodent malaria P. berghei in parasites grown in vivo (11de Koning-Ward T.F. O'Donnell R.A. Drew D.R. Thomson R. Speed T.P. Crabb B.S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Hence, if the MSP-1 double EGF module does mediate an essential interaction with the erythrocyte surface, then each module, no matter what its Plasmodium species of origin, should bind efficiently to receptor orthologs from broad host origins. The finding that the MSP-119 domain could be changed to antigenically divergent forms without an obvious effect on growth has proved useful for the development of a novel correlate-of-protection invasion inhibition assay (4O'Donnell R.A. de Koning-Ward T.F. Burt R.A. Bockarie M. Reeder J.C. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 11de Koning-Ward T.F. O'Donnell R.A. Drew D.R. Thomson R. Speed T.P. Crabb B.S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); however, it has also raised an interesting dilemma of considerable relevance to vaccine development: will vaccine-induced immune pressure rapidly select for antibody escape mutants? We and others have hypothesized that this is unlikely because the requirement for the MSP-119 module to form a tight U-shaped fold may place considerable constraints on the molecule such that compensatory changes may be required to accommodate individual point mutations (4O'Donnell R.A. de Koning-Ward T.F.

Med. 2001; 193: F51-F54Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, point mutations are not common in P. falciparum MSP-119 sequences from field isolates, despite the likelihood that this module is under considerable selection pressure (13Kang Y. Long C.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Qari S.H. Shi Y.P. Goldman I.F. Nahlen B.L. Tibayrenc M. Lal A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here, we addressed whether MSP-119 could functionally accommodate more radical change and, in the process, examined the possibility that the double EGF modules of different MSPs may be capable of performing the same biological role. Using allelic replacement in P. falciparum, we show that the MSP-1 EGF domains can be functionally complemented by the double EGF module found in a different and highly divergent parasite protein, P. berghei MSP-8 (15Burns Jr., J.M. Belk C.C. Dunn P.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6189-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Black C.G. Wu T. Wang L. Hibbs A.R. Coppel R.L. Mol. Biochem.

However, we also show that some other double EGF domains, including chimeras of P. falciparum-P. chabaudi MSP-119 sequences, do not appear to function in the context of MSP-1, suggesting that there are structural and functional constraints on sequence changes to this module. Plasmid Construction—The DNA sequence immediately 5′ to the double EGF-like domains of P. falciparum MSP-1 was amplified from D10 genomic DNA using the following oligonucleotides (restriction sites are underlined): PfMSP1/8.1 (CTGTAAGGGTAAGTGGTAGTTCAGGATCCACAAAAG) and PfMSP1/8.2 (GGGCATTTCTCATTTTTACATTGGTGTTGTGAAATGTTTAACATATCTTGG). The DNA sequence encoding the double EGF-like domains and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attachment sequence of P. berghei MSP-8 was amplified from P. bergehi (ANKA strain) genomic DNA using the following oligonucleotides (restriction sites are underlined): PfMSP1/8.3 (CACAACACCAATGTAAAAATGAGAAATGCCCAATAAACTCAAATTG) and PfMSP-1/8.4 (CCGCTCGAGTTACATTATATATATGCATACTATTGAAATTAAAAAG. The 5′ P. falciparum MSP-1 DNA and the P. berghei MSP-8 EGF DNA were sewn together by PCR using the oligonucleotides PfMSP1/8.1 and PfMSP1/8.4. The resulting chimeric DNA sequence was digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI and then ligated into BglII/XhoI-digested vector pHH1 (17Reed M.B. Saliba K.J. Caruana S.R. Kirk K. Cowman A.F. Nature. 2000; 403: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar) to create the plasmid pMSP1/Pb8. Parasite Culture and Transfection—P. falciparum D10 strain parasites were cultured and synchronized as per standard procedures (18Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2829) Google Scholar, 19Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6158) Google Scholar). Ring-stage parasites (∼5% parasitemia) were transfected with 100 μg of purified plasmid DNA (Plasmid Maxi Kit; Qiagen) as described previously (20Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7289-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), except that modified electroporation conditions were used (21Fidock D.A. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10931-10936Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Nucleic Acid Analysis—Genomic DNA isolated from mixed trophozoite/schizont-stage parasites was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization largely using standard procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—The DNA sequence corresponding to the terminal region of the P. berghei MSP-8 gene was amplified from P. falciparum (D10 line) genomic DNA using the following oligonucleotides (restriction sites are underlined): PbMSP8EGF.1 (CGCGACGCGTGGATCCACCATGATTTGTAAAAATGAGAAATGCCCAATAAAC) and PbMSP8EGF.2 (CTAGTCTAGACTCGAGCTAACTAGATGAACAATATATACCATCTCC). The resulting PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI (Promega), ligated into the appropriate pGEX vectors, and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells (Stratagene) as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (23Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). Generation of Antibodies—To generate antisera, 6-week-old female Balb/c mice and 3-month-old New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with 40 and 150 μg of glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, respectively, in Freund's complete adjuvant. Animals were boosted three times with 35 and 120 μg of protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant 5 weeks after injection, after which the animals were bled for serum collection. Anti-glutathione S-transferase antibodies were removed from rabbit serum using a glutathione S-transferase-bound CnBr-activated Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—To obtain pure ring-stage parasite populations, parasites were double-synchronized 4 h apart with 5% sorbitol (Sigma). Parasite proteins were obtained by saponin lysis (0.15%) of infected red blood cells at several time points after synchronization. Proteins were separated on 12% nonreducing SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting as described previously (4O'Donnell R.A. de Koning-Ward T.F. Burt R.A. Bockarie M. Reeder J.C. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Growth, Invasion, and Invasion-Inhibition Assays—The growth rate of parasite lines was compared in a 5-day growth rate assay as described previously (24Baldi D.L. Andrews K.T. Waller R.F. Roos D.S. Howard R.F. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2435-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For invasion assays, mature-stage parasites were adjusted to 1% parasitemia and 4% hematocrit. Aliquots of 1 ml were washed and resuspended in control NaHCO3 (0.2%)-buffered media or in buffered media containing either Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (0.066 unit/ml; Calbiochem), l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (0.9 mg/ml; Sigma), or α-chymotrypsin (0.9 mg/ml; Sigma). Parasites were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then washed once with buffered media. Parasites were incubated with buffered media containing soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml at 37 °C for 20 min and then washed three times. Control and enzyme-treated parasites were resuspended in culture media to a hematocrit of 4%, and three 100 μl aliquots were dispensed into the wells of a 96-well tray. Parasites were incubated for an additional 36–48 h to allow for schizont rupture and merozoite re-invasion into enzyme-treated red blood cells. After maturation, parasites were analyzed by flow cytometry (see the next paragraph). Antibody inhibition assays were performed essentially as described previously (4O'Donnell R.A. de Koning-Ward T.F. Burt R.A. Bockarie M. Reeder J.C. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), except that re-invaded parasites were allowed to mature through to the trophozoite stage. Seventy of 100 μl of culture media was removed from each well and replaced with 70 μl of buffered media. The washed red blood cells were resuspended; 10 μl was removed and transferred to a fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) tube. 190 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide was mixed with red blood cells and left to stain the parasite nucleus of infected red blood cells at room temperature for 5 min. FACS analysis was then performed on a FACsort (Becton Dickinson). Each well of a triplicate set was analyzed individually by counting 100,000 red blood cells. Red blood cells infected with re-invaded parasites were identified based on fluorescence and FACS data analyzed using CellQuest V3.3 software. Molecular Modeling—Models of EGF modules were generated by comparative modeling (25Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar) using the P. falciparum MSP-119 crystal structure (26Pizarro J. Chitarra V. Verger D. Holm I. Petres S. Dartevelle S. Nato F. Longacre S. Bentley G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The alignment used to generate these structures is shown in Fig 1B. The MODELLER (6v2) program (27Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10512) Google Scholar) was used to generate 25 initial model structures. The structure with the lowest MODELLER objective function was used for further analysis. The quality of the model was assessed using the Profiles-3D (28Luethy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar) program. All models had positive s-scores across all residues from the Profiles-3D verification analysis (applying a 21-residue sliding window). Buried surface areas were calculated as the difference in solvent-accessible surface areas in uncomplexed and complexed structures using the program NACCESS v.2.1.1. Functional Complementation of the MSP-1 EGF Domains with Those from P. berghei MSP-8 —Using allelic replacement into the full-length P. falciparum MSP-1 gene, we have shown previously that the double EGF-like module from P. chabaudi MSP-1 can fully complement the function of its P. falciparum counterpart in erythrocyte invasion (4O'Donnell R.A. de Koning-Ward T.F. Burt R.A. Bockarie M. Reeder J.C. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 10O'Donnell R.A. Saul A. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This surprising result led us to examine whether the double EGF module from a more distantly related, non-MSP-1 molecule could similarly complement function in P. falciparum MSP-1. For this we chose the double EGF domain region from a recently identified antigen known as MSP-8 (15Burns Jr., J.M. Belk C.C. Dunn P.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6189-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Black C.G. Wu T. Wang L. Hibbs A.R. Coppel R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Like MSP-1, MSP-8 is glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored and contains a double EGF-like domain at its C terminus, although these proteins bear little resemblance elsewhere in their sequences. As evidenced by phylogenetic analysis of double EGF domain sequences from human (P. falciparum) and rodent species (P. berghei and P. yoelii), MSP-8 EGF sequences form a distinct evolutionary grouping, clearly separated from MSP-1 EGF sequences (Fig. 1A). Also included in this analysis was the sequence from the C-terminal double EGF-like domains of the sexual-stage ookinete surface antigen PfS25 (29Tomas A.M. Margos G. Dimopoulos G. van Lin L.H. de Koning-Ward T.F. Sinha R. Lupetti P. Beetsma A.L. Rodriguez M.C. Karras M. Hager A. Mendoza J. Butcher G.A. Kafatos F. Janse C.J. Waters A.P. Sinden R.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3975-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). As expected, the PfS25 sequence was only distantly related to both MSP-1 and MSP-8 EGF sequences. The P. berghei MSP-8 double EGF sequence is 81 amino acids in length, considerably shorter than the corresponding MSP-1 sequences (Fig. 1B). The domain shares 22% amino acid identity with P. falciparum MSP-1 EGF domains after the inclusion of five gaps in the alignment and excluding the canonical cysteine residues (Fig. 1B). We generated a transfection construct, pMSP1/Pb8, designed to replace the nucleotides encoding the P. falciparum MSP-1 EGF domains with the corresponding residues from P. berghei MSP-8 as shown in Fig. 1C. Upon transfection into the P. falciparum line D10, pMSP1/Pb8 was shown to have integrated into the MSP-1 gene. The transfected population, D10-MSP1/Pb8, was cloned, and randomly selected clones were analyzed. Southern blot analysis of XbaI-digested genomic DNA from a representative clone showed that the plasmid had integrated into the target site through the expected recombination event with the disappearance of the endogenous 6.1-kb fragment and the appearance of the expected 4.2- and 9-kb integration fragments (Fig. 1, C and D). The 7.1-kb fragment also observed represents tandemly repeated plasmid copies that typically integrate into the locus after this type of recombination event, probably as a consequence of plasmids initially replicating as concatamers before integration (30O'Donnell R.A. Preiser P.R. Williamson D.H. Moore P.W. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Williamson D. Janse C. Moore P. Waters A. Preiser P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To examine expression of the hybrid MSP-1/MSP-8 protein, extracts of blood-stage D10-MSP1/Pb8 parasites were analyzed by probing Western blot membranes with antibodies generated against the EGF domains of P. falciparum MSP-1 and P. berghei MSP-8. Whereas parental D10 parasites expressed the expected P. falciparum MSP-1 reactive species at 200, 42, and 19 kDa, samples from D10-MSP1/Pb8 did not react with this reagent (Fig. 2A). In contrast, identical blots probed with P. berghei MSP-8 antibodies reacted in the opposite manner with strongly reactive species observed in D10-MSP1/Pb8 parasites. As expected, cross-reactive 200- and 42-kDa species were detected in both lines, with an antibody specific for the 33-kDa fragment of P. falciparum MSP-1 demonstrating that the MSP-1 molecules of these two parasite lines differ only in their MSP-119 region (Fig. 2A). Double labeling IFA showed the expected specific reciprocal pattern of expression, with characteristic surface labeling observed with both antibodies (Fig. 2B). A time-course experiment revealed that the MSP-1 proteins expressed by the two parasite lines were co-regulated late in the erythrocytic cycle (Fig. 2C). Together, these data show that D10-MSP1/Pb8 parasites express an MSP-1 hybrid that incorporates the EGF domains from P. berghei MSP-8 at its C terminus. Replacement of the MSP-1 EGF domains in this manner did not significantly affect parasite growth in a 5-day growth rate assay (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, D10-MSP1/Pb8 parasites appear to invade erythrocytes using the same invasion pathway as parental D10 parasites because both lines were indistinguishable in their ability to enter erythrocytes treated with various enzyme combinations that define such pathways (Fig. 3B) (32Dolan S.A. Miller L.H. Wellems T.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 86: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 33Dolan S.A. Proctor J.L. Alling D.W. Okubo Y. Wellems T.E. Miller L.H. Mol. Biochem.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As described previously (35Duraisingh M.T. Triglia T. Ralph S.A. Rayner J.C. Barnwell J.W. McFadden G.I. Cowman A.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the D10 line invaded red blood cells using a mostly trypsin-dependent, neuraminidase- and chymotrypsin-independent pathway. Also as expected, D10-MSP1/Pb8 parasites are capable of avoiding the erythrocyte invasion-inhibitory effect of P. falciparum antibodies that target the MSP-1 EGF module (Fig. 3C). Taken together, the P. berghei MSP-8 EGF domains appear to efficiently complement the function of their MSP-1 counterparts. MSP-8 EGF Domains Are Predicted to Fold Similarly to Those of MSP-1: Identification of a Conserved Pocket—The crystal and NMR structures of the P. falciparum MSP-1 EGF domains have been determined (26Pizarro J. Chitarra V. Verger D. Holm I. Petres S. Dartevelle S. Nato F. Longacre S. Bentley G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 36Morgan W. Birdsall B. Frenkiel T. Gradwell M. Burghaus P. Syed S. Uthaipibull C. Holder A. Feeney J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), as have the crystal structures for the P. cynomolgi and P. knowlesi versions of this molecule (37Chitarra V. Holm I. Bentley G.A. Petres S. Longacre S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 38Garman S. Simcoke W. Stowers A. Garboczi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7264-7269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All studies show that the MSP-1 EGF domains form a flat, almost disc-like structure with the two domains folded back on one another, not end-on-end as in some other multi-EGF domain proteins. Several residues in each EGF domain line the interface and clearly contribute to a tight association between the domains. In the P. falciparum MSP-1 structures, the most important of these residues appear to be Phe19, Lys29, Leu32, Leu86, Phe87, Ile90, and Phe91, although other residues are also involved in interdomain contacts (26Pizarro J. Chitarra V. Verger D. Holm I. Petres S. Dartevelle S. Nato F. Longacre S. Bentley G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These key residues are highlighted on a sequence alignment of the three EGF domain sequences that have complementary function (Fig. 1B). In P. berghei MSP-8, conservative changes are evident in only four of these seven positions. Nevertheless, using computer-simulated molecular modeling, the P. berghei MSP-8 EGF domains were predicted to form a highly stable structure very similar in size and shape to the MSP-1 EGF structure (Fig. 4A). A similar tight interface was predicted to occur between the two MSP-8 EGF domains. Specifically, the three-dimensional profile score for the model of P. berghei MSP-8 is 26. This compares favorably with the three-dimensional profile score of 34 for the NMR structure of P. falciparum MSP-1 (36Morgan W. Birdsall B. Frenkiel T. Gradwell M. Burghaus P. Syed S. Uthaipibull C. Holder A. Feeney J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and the expected value of 43 for a protein of this size (28Luethy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). At the interface between the two EGF domains of P. falciparum MSP-1, there is 1036 Å2 of surface buried. A slightly smaller surface area, 830 Å2, is buried in the model of P. berghei MSP-8. Given functional complementarity and the likelihood of a very similar fold for the double EGF domains of MSP-1 and MSP-8, we addressed whether the spatial arrangement of the few residues that are conserved between these sequences provides insight into potentially important functional regions of these domains. Fig. 4B shows surface representation of the crystal structure of P. falciparum MSP-119 with identical (dark blue) and conserved (light blue) amino acids highlighted. A distinct conserved region was evident on one face of the EGF module. This region comprised a significant depression and involves residues in the highly conserved Asn-Gly stretch at the beginning of EGF domain 2 (Fig. 1B) as well as a number of other residues from both EGF domains. It is possible that this conserved pocket represents a site of functional importance. Constraint on P. falciparum MSP-1 EGF Domain Function— The successful replacement of the MSP-1 EGF domains with those from P. berghei MSP-8 raised the possibility that even more radical change may be accommodated at the C terminus of MSP-1. To explore this, we attempted to use the same allelic replacement approach to determine whether the C-terminal double EGF domains from the P. berghei version of P25 (PbS25) could complement MSP-119 function. These domains share only 9% amino acid identity with their MSP-1 counterparts, excluding the cysteine residues. The plasmid constructed for this purpose, pPbS25.3′, was identical to that shown in Fig. 1C except for the EGF domains. This plasmid was successfully transfected into P. falciparum D10 parasites on two separate occasions; however, on each occasion, the plasmid was maintained episomally for an extended period and did not integrate into the MSP-1 locus (data not shown). Hence, it appears unlikely that the C-terminal PbS25 EGF domains are capable of complementing the function of the MSP-1 EGF module. Further in this regard, in the course of testing various P. falciparum/P. chabaudi MSP-1 chimeras (summarized in Fig. 5), we found that although the double EGF module of P. chabaudi can complement the function of its P. falciparum counterpart (see D10-PcMEGF and D10-PcM3′ chimeras), two chimeras that incorporate one domain each of P. falciparum and P. chabaudi did not integrate into the MSP-1 locus despite successful transfection and extended episomal maintenance of these constructs on two separate occasions each (data not shown). These constructs differed from each other only in the origin of the spacer region (Fig. 5). Whereas the failure of any one of these plasmids to integrate into the MSP-1 locus does not prove that the chimeric domains in question are incapable of fully complementing MSP-119 function, given that the same plasmid backbone was used in all instances and that two very similar plasmids (D10-PcME2+ and D10-PcME2) failed to integrate, it seems likely that modules comprising one domain each from P. falciparum and P. chabaudi do not complement P. falciparum MSP-119 function. It is possible that this incompatibility is because there are impediments to correct folding of the resulting chimeric domains. However, the three-dimensional profile scores for models of the MSP-1 EGF modules in D10-PcME2+ and D10-PcME2 were determined to be 40 and 39, respectively, which are significantly larger than 19, the value below which an incorrectly folded structure would be indicated, and are similar to the three-dimensional profile score of 43 for the fully functional chimeric MSP-1 EGF module in D10-PcM3′. In each of these chimeras, the interface between the two EGF domains buries ∼1150 Å2 of surface. Hence, molecular modeling did not reveal any structural instability that may exist in the MSP-1 EGF modules in D10-PcME2+ and D10-PcME2. The finding that the EGF module of P. berghei MSP-8 can complement the function of its MSP-1 counterpart reveals that the EGF domains of MSP-1 can accommodate extensive amino acid change without compromising the ability of the parasite to invade erythrocytes and to mature apparently normally through its blood-stage cycle. The double MSP-8 EGF domains exist naturally as a module at the C terminus of MSP-8, a protein that otherwise shows no apparent similarity to MSP-1. Therefore, the double EGF modules found at the C terminus of MSP-1 and MSP-8 appear capable of performing the same function both within and between very divergent Plasmodium species. EGF-like domains typically have binding functions, and it has long been assumed that such a role may exist for those at the C terminus of MSP-1. Recent work suggests that erythrocyte band 3 is a receptor for the P. falciparum MSP-1 EGFs (9Goel V. Li X. Chen H. Liu S. Chishti A. Oh S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In this regard, MSP-119 has been suggested to mediate a chymotrypsin-sensitive invasion pathway in P. falciparum (9Goel V. Li X. Chen H. Liu S. Chishti A. Oh S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, however, erythrocyte invasion of the D10 line is not sensitive to chymotrypsin, but as antibody inhibition studies have clearly demonstrated (this paper and Refs. 4O'Donnell R.A. de Koning-Ward T.F. Burt R.A. Bockarie M. Reeder J.C. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar and 10O'Donnell R.A. Saul A. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the D10 parasite line appears to require MSP-119 for invasion. Because it is not revealed by enzyme treatments, it seems unlikely that the MSP-119-band 3 interaction plays a role in invasion that is equivalent to the binding mediated by the apically located erythrocyte binding antigen family. Alternatively, it may be that the EGF module of MSP-1 does not have an essential receptor binding role. Rather, the function of these domains may be redundant; for example, they may play a passive role such as providing stability or appropriate spatial orientation of the large head group of MSP-1. However, a purely structural role for the MSP-1 EGF module also seems unlikely, given the apparent inability of MSP-1 to accommodate three different double EGF modules. Two of these modules comprised a mixture of EGF domains from P. chabaudi and P. falciparum MSP-1. This observation is consistent with the view that the appropriate tight packing of the EGF domains is essential for a specific function and that mutations on one EGF may be incompatible with those in close contact on the other. However, molecular modeling did not provide structural indications why the P. chabaudi/P. falciparum chimeras lacked function. Because longer P. chabaudi chimeras are functional in P. falciparum (see Fig. 5), the data suggest that residues within the second half of the first EGF domain comprising residues Gly24 to Arg42 from P. chabaudi are incompatible with the second EGF domain from P. falciparum. In the sequence alignment (Fig 1B) of P. chabaudi with P. falciparum, differences in the second half of the first EGF domain are generally conservative, although there are several differences involving changes in formal charge (E24G, Q36K, E37N, and G38D). In the second EGF domain, there are a large number of differences involving formal charge (E51N, D59S, T61D, T63R, E65V, S69D, S71R, E77T, T79K, K80E, and D82T). Not surprisingly, all these residues are solvent-exposed. The lack of apparent intramolecular structural incompatibilities in the chimeric molecules suggests that the incompatibility in the chimeras possibly arises at the intermolecular level, where a particular combination of residues from both domains is required for normal, potentially electrostatic interaction. Such a constraint explains, in part, why it is that, despite considerable immune pressure, the MSP-1 EGF sequences are relatively conserved in field isolates of P. falciparum. Given that the diversity of the sequences of MSP-1 EGFs from other species appears to be more extensive than in P. falciparum, it is likely that there are additional explanations for the lack of diversity in P. falciparum MSP-1 sequences. It remains plausible that, although it appears to be an ancient organism, P. falciparum strains circulating today have a relatively recent common ancestor, and as a result, there has been less time for mutations to accumulate in parasite antigens such as MSP-119 that have particular structure-function constraints (39Ayala F.J. Rich S.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 261: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 40Rich S.M. Ayala F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6994-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). With a few notable exceptions (e.g. MSP-2), most of the known membrane-associated proteins found at the surface of Plasmodium merozoites posses either one or two EGF domains at their C terminus. In this paper, by demonstrating that the double EGF module of one of these proteins can perform the apparently essential function of another, the likelihood arises that some or all of these domains may perform a common biological role. Although the precise nature of this role remains to be elucidated, it is now reasonable to suggest that it may be possible to design drugs that target multiple EGF domains and hence interfere with this common function. Of relevance to this, we identified a distinct region on one face of the double EGF module that is highly conserved across MSP-1 and MSP-8. Because these otherwise very divergent domains perform the same function, at least in the context of MSP-1, this conserved pocket is of potential functional importance. Alternatively, this region may be inaccessible to antibodies and hence not susceptible to selective pressure. However, if the former is true, this pocket would constitute a potential drug target, especially because it has the appropriate dimensions that make it accessible by small compounds. Significantly, the common cross-species function of the MSP-1 and MSP-8 EGF modules means that drug candidates can be screened for potency both in vitro using cultured P. falciparum and in rodents using P. beghei or other murine malaria species.

https://openalex.org/W2088508658,"Transcription of interleukin (IL)-12 p40 in myeloid cells is attributed to the recruitment of multiple activated transcription factors such as nuclear factor κB (NFκB), CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β, ets-2, PU.1, and so forth. We now provide the first description of the human erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF) in human primary macrophages and identify the role of EKLF in IL-12 p40 expression. EKLF-specific binding to the CACCC element (-224 to -220) on the human IL-12 p40 promoter was observed in resting human primary macrophages. Functional analysis of the CACCC element revealed a dependent role for EKLF binding in activating IL-12 p40 transcription in resting RAW264.7 cells, whereas EKLF overexpression in the presence or absence of this element repressed IL-12 p40 transcription in interferon γ/lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Murine endogenous IL-12 p40 mRNA was consistently induced by overexpressed EKLF in resting RAW264.7 cells, whereas EKLF suppressed IL-12 p40 expression in activated RAW264.7 cells. Modulation of nuclear binding activities at the IL-12 p40 NFκB half-site was induced by EKLF for down-regulation of IL-12 p40 transcription in activated RAW264.7 cells, but no effect of EKLF on NFκB activity was observed in resting RAW264.7 cells. Taken together, we identify EKLF as a transcription factor in macrophages able to regulate IL-12 p40 transcription depending on the cellular activation status. The bifunctional control of IL-12 p40 by EKLF and its modulation of NFκB support a potential function for this factor in orchestrating IL-12 p40 production in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1987121151,"The existence of a biochemical threshold effect in the metabolic expression of oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies has considerable implications for the understanding of mitochondrial bioenergetics and the study of mitochondrial diseases. However, the molecular bases of this phenomenon remain unclear. We report here a new mechanism to explain this threshold effect, based on a reserve of enzymes not initially participating in the respiratory rate that can be activated either to respond to a flux increase or to compensate for a defect induced by a mutation. We show that this mobilization occurs through 1) the assembly of inactive adenine nucleotide translocator isoform 1 subunits into oligomeric active carriers or 2) conformational changes in the adenine nucleotide translocator isoform 1 in a permeability transition pore-like structure. We discuss how these transitions are sensitive to the steady state of oxidative phosphorylation functioning or tissue and analyze their consequences on the threshold effect.

The role of mitochondria in mammalian cells is generally presented as a “central pathway” for energy metabolism, but other important aspects of mitochondrial function have also been evidenced, such as its key role in apoptosis, free radical production, thermogenesis, and calcium signaling. Consequently, impairments of mitochondrial function have been associated with the emergence of severe human disorders, known as mitochondrial cytopathies (1Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2612) Google Scholar, 2DiMauro S. Schon E.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2656-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Despite a broad characterization of the genetic defects leading to mitochondrial disorders, few of their pathogenetic mechanisms are fully understood. In particular, the relationship between the presence of an activity defect in a given OXPHOS 1The abbreviations used are: OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocator; TMPD, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine; CATR, carboxyatractyloside; BN, blue native; abs, antibodies; CsA, cyclosporin A; CyD, cyclophilin D. 1The abbreviations used are: OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocator; TMPD, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine; CATR, carboxyatractyloside; BN, blue native; abs, antibodies; CsA, cyclosporin A; CyD, cyclophilin D. complex and its effect on mitochondrial energy production remains problematic. Indeed, several authors have showed that it was possible to inhibit the activity of various OXPHOS complexes, up to a critical value, without affecting the rate of mitochondrial respiration or ATP synthesis (3Rossignol R. Faustin B. Rocher C. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Letellier T. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is called the “biochemical threshold effect” (4Letellier T. Heinrich R. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It partially controls the phenotypic expression of OXPHOS defects and therefore contributes to the variability in the clinical presentation of mitochondrial disorders. It has also been reported that a variation in the biochemical threshold value between tissues explains part of the tissue specificity observed in mitochondrial diseases (5Rossignol R. Malgat M. Mazat J.-P. Letellier T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33426-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, finding the molecular mechanisms that determine the threshold value and its variability will contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of mitochondrial cytopathies and help to design new therapeutic approaches (6Taylor R.W. Wardell T.M. Smith P.M. Muratovska A. Murphy M.P. Turnbull D.M. Lightowlers R.N. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2001; 49: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism for the biochemical threshold effect is the existence of an excess of inactive OXPHOS complexes that may act as a “reserve” to compensate for a deficit (5Rossignol R. Malgat M. Mazat J.-P. Letellier T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33426-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 7Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the biochemical threshold effect resulted from the mobilization of a pool of inactive OXPHOS enzymes. We also analyzed how this process varied in different tissues, enzyme isoforms, or respiratory steady states. Our study focused on the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) because it is possible to quantify the functional carriers participating actively in respiration using CATR (8Streicher-Scott J. Lapidus R. Sokolove P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 9Gellerich F.N. Kunz W.S. Bohnensack R.

Biochem. 1975; 52: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that binds only to the active form (13Kramer R. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4209-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14Rigaud J.L. Bluzat A. Buschlen S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To study the molecular basis of the ANT reserve, we analyzed the oligomeric state of the ANT1 isoform by blue native-PAGE/modified SDS-PAGE on mitochondria taken during different respiratory steady states obtained with various energy substrates. Our results give the first molecular explanations for the biochemical threshold effect, based on the excess of activity provided by either 1) a mobilization of inactive ANT1 subunits that assemble into new oligomeric active carriers or 2) conformational changes in ANT1 in a permeability transition pore-like structure. Animals—Male Wistar rats used for this study weighed 200 to 300 g and had free access to water and standard laboratory diet. Experimental animals were sacrificed by cervical shock and decapitation. Mitochondrial Preparations—Rat muscle (gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus) and heart mitochondria (15Morgan-Hughes J.A. Darveniza P. Kkahn S.N. Landon D.N. Sherratt R.M. Land J.M. Clark J.B. Brain. 1977; 100: 617-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), liver and kidney mitochondria (16Johnson D. Lardy H. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 94-96Crossref Scopus (1198) Google Scholar), and brain mitochondria (isolated from whole brain) (17Clark J.B. Nicklas W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4724-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were isolated as detailed previously. Protein concentration was estimated by the Biuret method (18Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The mitochondria were made up to a concentration of 50-80 mg of protein/ml in isolation buffer. Human Muscle Biopsies—Three patients were selected at the Centre Hospitalier Régional de Bordeaux and diagnosed by clinical investigations, biological studies (especially blood lactate and pyruvate), and histo-enzymological studies. Control muscles were taken from patients who underwent muscle biopsy for neuromuscular symptoms but were ultimately found to be free of any mitochondrial disease. Muscle biopsies were performed on the quadriceps muscle under general anesthesia (taken with informed consent of the patients or their parents). Muscle biopsies were stored in 10 ml of ice-cold buffer (10 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm taurine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm imidazol, 0.1 m K+MES, 5 mm ATP, and 20 mm phosphocreatine) and used in the following hour. The mitochondrial respiratory rate was measured on saponin-permeabilized muscle fibers according to the procedures developed by Letellier et al. (19Letellier T. Malgat M. Coquet M. Moretto B. Parrot-Roulaud F. Mazat J.P. Pediatr. Res. 1992; 32: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was measured as described on various respiratory substrates in a medium containing 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm taurine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm imidazol, 0.1 M K+MES, 3 mm KH2PO4, and 5 mg/ml BSA and expressed in natom of oxygen per minute per milligram of fibers. Oxygraphic Measurements—Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was monitored at 30 °C in a 1-ml thermostatically controlled chamber equipped with a Clark oxygen electrode connected to a computer, which gave an on-line display of the respiratory rate value. The respiration buffers used are described in Ref. 5Rossignol R. Malgat M. Mazat J.-P. Letellier T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33426-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, plus respiratory substrates (10 mm pyruvate, with 10 mm malate, or 25 mm succinate in presence of 0.4 μg/ml rotenone, or 3 mm ascorbate, and 0.5 mm TMPD). The mitochondrial concentration used for this study was 1 mg/ml, and state 3 was obtained as described previously (20Chance B. Williams G.R. Adv. Enzymol. 1956; 17: 65-134PubMed Google Scholar), adding 2 mm ADP. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was measured as described above on various respiratory substrates and expressed in natom of oxygen per minute per milligram of proteins. Titration Curves—The titration curves of the step catalyzed by ANT were performed using CATR (Sigma), a derivative of atractyloside, a specific irreversible inhibitor of this step (12Klingenberg M. Grebe K. Scherer B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The inhibition curves were carried out at state 3 on mitochondria respiring on pyruvatemalate, or rotenone-succinate, or ascorbate-TMPD with enough ADP (2 mm) to maintain stable, steady-state respiration. A single concentration of CATR was injected into the oxygraph for one mitochondrial sample at state 3, and then the level of inhibition was recorded. However, because ANT activity is dependent on the ΔμH+ generated by the respiratory chain, it was impossible to determine the activity of the isolated step under the same conditions as for the global flux. For this reason, we used the model presented in Ref. 9Gellerich F.N. Kunz W.S. Bohnensack R. FEBS. 1990; 274: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar based on a non-linear regression that fits the respiratory rate inhibition curve. The ‘Simfit’ program was used for nonlinear fitting (21Holzhutter H.G. Colosimo A. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1990; 6: 23-28PubMed Google Scholar). Using the parameters obtained by this fitting procedure and the model equations, we drew the inhibition curve of the isolated step activity with the program TK Solver Plus (Universal Technical Systems, Rockford, IL). This model describes the effect of CATR, a noncompetitive inhibitor of ANT, on respiration. By fitting the titration curves with the experimental points, it calculated the total amount of carrier involved in the flux (Imax) but also the inhibition constant of equilibrium (Ki) for CATR, although this model does not take into account the mitochondrial complexity (proton leakage, slippage, other transporters). We had previously validated the use of this model (22Letellier T. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the experimental and fitted titration curves were identical. Threshold Curves and Determination of Threshold Value—The threshold curves come from the titration curves and represent the state 3 respiratory rate (percentage) as a function of ANT inhibition (percentage). The threshold values were determined as described by Rossignol et al. (5Rossignol R. Malgat M. Mazat J.-P. Letellier T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33426-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Two linear regressions were carried out on the first and last points of the threshold curve using the least-squares method. We then defined the threshold value as the abscissa of the intersection point between these two regression lines. Electrophoretic Techniques—Isolated rat mitochondria from muscle and kidney (1 mg/ml) were submitted to oxygraphic measurements at state 3 of respiration on pyruvate-malate, succinate, or ascorbate-TMPD. During this steady state, mitochondria were taken from the oxygraph and centrifuged (20 min, 8000 rpm, 4 °C). The pellets were suspended in 1 m 6-aminocaproic acid and 50 mm Bis-Tris. The mitochondrial extracts solubilized by n-dodecylmaltoside or digitonin were centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 100,000 × g and the supernatant was immediately loaded on the top of 10% or 5-13% acrylamide-bis gradient gels for BN-PAGE as described previously (23Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). The bands were cut and submitted to a second dimension by SDS-PAGE in presence of 1% β-mercaptoethanol, modified with a low concentration of SDS (2%). The gel was then subjected to Western blotting. Western Blots—Mitochondrial proteins with 1 μg/ml protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and pepstatin) were separated according to different electrophoretic conditions (as described below), electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) and submitted to primary ab in 5% milk. Polyclonal antibodies (abs) specific for human ANT1 isoform (Ab1, amino acids 2-11; Ab2, amino acids 161-171) were purchased from Oncogene Research Products. Polyclonal ANT abs (1:500) were kindly provided by Pr. D. C. Wallace (University of California, Irvine, CA). Abs for Porin (31HL) and cyclophilin D were purchased from Calbiochem and complex II-70 Kda, complex III Core 2, and COX-IV from Molecular Probes. All abs were used at dilutions recommended by the manufacturer. After washing steps, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated purified secondary abs (Bio-Rad). Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and revealed by autoradiography. Protein Detection and Analysis—The proteins separated by second modified SDS-PAGE dimension were subjected to either Western blotting or staining by Sypro Ruby (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescent proteins were detected with a UV-transilluminator system and recorded by using a Herada 429K digital video camera. The protein spots were cut and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry. Densitometric analysis on Western blots was carried out using NIH Image J software by drawing rectangles around individual spots to quantify their total staining intensity (24Schagger H. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Mobilization of ANT and Its Involvement in the Threshold Effect in Different Respiratory Chain Activities—We quantified the functional ANT participating in different respiratory steady states obtained with various energy substrates (pyruvate-malate, succinate, and ascorbate-TMPD) on mitochondria isolated from five rat tissues (muscle, heart, liver, kidney, and brain) (Fig. 1A). We titrated mitochondrial respiration by increasing CATR concentrations and determined the amount of inhibitor necessary to inhibit all the carriers involved in the flux (Imax). The Gellerich model (9Gellerich F.N. Kunz W.S. Bohnensack R. FEBS. 1990; 274: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was used to determine accurate Imax values as well as the inhibition constant (Ki) (Table I).Table IRespiratory and inhibition parameters used and obtained in this studyRat TissuenaNumber of independant measurements based on three different mitochondrial preparations or number of patients investigated.Respiratory SubstratesPyruvate-MalateSuccinateAscorbate-TMPDJO2bThe state 3 respiratory rate, expressed as natomO per minute per milligrams of proteins for isolated mitochondria and natomO per minutes per milligram of fibers for human muscle fibers.RCRcRespiratory control ratio.KidCATR inhibition constant.TeThreshold values expressed as a percentage of ANT inhibition.ImaxfAmount of CATR necessary to return from state 3 to state 4 respiration.JO2KiTImaxJO2KiTImaxnm%nmol of CATR/mgnm%nmol of CATR/mgnm%nmol of CATR/mgMuscle−CsA9179 ± 8.24.7 ± 2.214.8 ± 1.389 ± 2.21.53 ± 0.11242 ± 1821.2 ± 4.6*87 ± 3.22.89 ± 0.23542 ± 3820.5 ± 2.5*90 ± 2.34.57 ± 0.15+CsA7177 ± 9.54.1 ± 1.319.6 ± 4.188 ± 1.92.64 ± 0.09221 ± 1017.8 ± 1.389 ± 2.12.66 ± 0.41526 ± 2618.4 ± 2.188 ± 2.14.32 ± 0.23Brain8176 ± 102.8 ± 1.110.6 ± 2.782 ± 2.30.57 ± 0.11208 ± 3414.1 ± 4.784 ± 3.41.15 ± 0.31523 ± 3614.4 ± 4.181 ± 2.21.78 ± 0.19Liver5139 ± 173.1 ± 1.46.7 ± 1.5**92 ± 2.40.32 ± 0.08213 ± 2410.2 ± 4.277 ± 3.40.33 ± 0.12381 ± 2715.3 ± 6.565 ± 6.60.36 ± 0.08Kidney6155 ± 144.2 ± 2.79.31 ± 2.691 ± 2.30.78 ± 0.14248 ± 126.33 ± 1.580 ± 2.30.86 ± 0.18375 ± 2411.1 ± 4.171 ± 4.60.88 ± 0.09Heart5224 ± 215.3 ± 1.113.7 ± 2.286 ± 2.71.47 ± 0.12300 ± 2914.3 ± 2.990 ± 1.91.5 ± 0.1456 ± 4316.6 ± 1.890 ± 3.21.39 ± 0.14Permeabilized cellsHuman muscle fibers34.62 ± 1.13.6 ± 0.426.9 ± 4.284 ± 1.21.83 ± 0.17.65 ± 2.224.5 ± 1.891 ± 1.62.34 ± 0.114.2 ± 3.619.4 ± 2.282 ± 2.13.91 ± 0.2a Number of independant measurements based on three different mitochondrial preparations or number of patients investigated.b The state 3 respiratory rate, expressed as natomO per minute per milligrams of proteins for isolated mitochondria and natomO per minutes per milligram of fibers for human muscle fibers.c Respiratory control ratio.d CATR inhibition constant.e Threshold values expressed as a percentage of ANT inhibition.f Amount of CATR necessary to return from state 3 to state 4 respiration. Open table in a new tab Two groups of tissues were distinguished by their titration curves: liver, kidney, and brain, with a low amount of ANT participating in the respiration on pyruvate-malate (between 0.3 and 0.8 nmol of CATR/mg), and heart and muscle, with at least twice as many carriers (1.5 nmol of CATR/mg). These values are in agreement with earlier results (25Doussière J. Ligeti E. Brandolin G. Vignais P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Kunz W. Gellerich F.N. Schild L. Schonfeld P. FEBS Lett. 1988; 233: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Groen A.K. Wanders R.J.A. Westerhoff H.V. Van der meer R. Tager J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2754-2757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, our results show that the amounts of ANT participating in the flux (Imax) increased in muscle and brain when the respiratory rate was raised (Fig. 1B and Table I). In muscle, Imax values increased from 1.53 nmol of CATR/mg on pyruvate-malate to 2.89 on succinate and, finally, 4.57 on ascorbate-TMPD. This ANT mobilization also occurred in brain mitochondria, although to a lesser extent (Table I). The affinity of CATR for ANT (Ki) was statistically similar (p < 0.05) in all respiratory states, but they were different in tissues for a given steady state (Table I). These Ki values are also in agreement with in vitro work performed on isolated carriers (8Streicher-Scott J. Lapidus R. Sokolove P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 12Klingenberg M. Grebe K. Scherer B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The threshold curves obtained for the five tissues on various respiratory substrates presented in Fig. 1B represent the effect of ANT inhibition by CATR on the overall respiratory rate. As previously reported (5Rossignol R. Malgat M. Mazat J.-P. Letellier T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33426-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), two types of threshold curves (type I and II) have been observed, varying according to tissues and/or respiratory steady states (Fig. 1B). For instance, muscle and brain, where an increase in Imax was observed according to the flux, showed the same curve profile with high threshold values, irrespective of the substrate used (type I curves). Conversely, the curves obtained for liver and kidney varied strongly in shape (type I/type II transition) with lower threshold values (Fig. 1B and Table I). The decrease in threshold value was smaller in the case of kidney tissue. Surprisingly, heart was the only tissue to maintain a type I curve without any increase in Imax. To verify whether ANT mobilization also occurred in vivo, we used human muscle fibers taken from biopsies and permeabilized them for respiratory studies using saponin 50 μg/ml (19Letellier T. Malgat M. Coquet M. Moretto B. Parrot-Roulaud F. Mazat J.P. Pediatr. Res. 1992; 32: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). CATR titration curves were obtained on pyruvate-malate, succinate, and ascorbate-TMPD (Fig. 2A). Ki values remained unchanged, whereas Imax increased significantly when the respiratory steady state changed (Table I). This indicated ANT mobilization in muscle fibers, resulting in threshold values over 80% of ANT inhibition, irrespective of the substrate (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the increase in functional ANT according to the respiratory flux observed in isolated mitochondria also occurred in living cells and had the same effect on the threshold curves. Total Amount of ANT and ANT Isoforms 1 and 2 in Different Tissues—To determine 1) the ANT participating in the respiratory rate, 2) the total amount of carriers, and 3) their composition in isoforms 1 and 2, we performed Western blotting using ANT polyclonal abs or ANT1 specifics (Ab2). The results show a considerable variation among tissues in the total amount of carriers as well as their ANT1 isoform content (Table II). Muscle and heart had the same absolute amount of total ANT (100%), whereas values in brain (50.6%), kidney (24.7%), and liver (11.7%) were lower (Fig. 3A and Table II). Major variations were also observed in the proportion of ANT1 (Fig. 3B). Thus, rough quantification of the ANT1 tissue expressions were in agreement with the ANT1 mRNA quantification as determined by quantitative PCR (28Dorner A. Olesch M. Giessen S. Pauschinger M. Schultheiss H.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); we used these mRNA proportions to determine the amount of ANT2 relative to the total carrier content obtained by Western blot. Therefore, we quantified the ANT1 and ANT2 content within the total pool of carriers in each tissue. Isoform 1 was mainly expressed in muscle mitochondria (81.2%), whereas heart contained the highest amount of isoform 2 (37% of total ANT) compared with the other tissues (Table II). The distribution of these mRNA isoforms is very similar in rat and human tissues (29Doerner A. Pauschinger M. Badorff A. Noutsias M. Giessen S. Schulze K. Bilger J. Rauch U. Schultheiss H.P.

Mitochondrial proteins were then solubilized using n-dodecylmaltoside (n-dodecylmaltoside/protein ratio of 1.5 g/g) (30Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. J. Biol.

Western blot analysis identified native complex III (with an apparent molecular mass of 260 kDa), complex IV (200 kDa), complex II (of 120 kDa), and Porin (31 kDa) (Fig. 4A). Mitochondrial proteins were further separated in a second dimension (modified SDS-PAGE), then immunoblotted with anti-ANT1 (Ab1) and anti-Porin. The 2D pattern showed Porin monomers (31 kDa) and two forms of ANT1: a 35-kDa monomer and one in a 200-kDa complex. As the oligomeric form of the carrier (Fig. 4A) required for our analysis could not be maintained under these experimental conditions, we solubilized proteins with a “softer” detergent. We used three concentrations of digitonin (digitonin/protein ratios of 1, 3, and 6 g/g; data not shown) and performed BN-PAGE/modified SDS-PAGE. Likewise, no difference in the sensitivity to detergent was observed between tissues. The first dimension (with 3 g/g) was analyzed by Western blot, using anti-Porin (31HL) then anti-cytochrome c oxydase IV (Fig. 4B). On the first dimension, the anti-Porin revealed a first spot at 75 kDa, a second spot at 220 kDa, a third at 300 kDa, and a final spot at more than 300 kDa. The anti-cytochrome c oxydase IV ab revealed the native complex IV at 200 kDa. The N-terminal domain of ANT1 was not recognized by the abs in the first dimension, irrespective of the detergent used (data not shown). Fig. 4B shows the second dimension immunoblotted with anti-Porin (31HL) only (right ge), whereas the left gel was probed with anti-Porin and anti-ANT1 (Ab1). The four spots obtained for Porin clearly established its association in several macrocomplexes: >300, 300, 220, and 75 kDa. Three forms of ANT1 were identified: 65-kDa dimers (D1), 120-kDa coupled dimers (2D1), and 35-kDa monomers (M1). ANT1 dimer D1 colocalized with Porin, forming a macrocomplex bigger than 300 kDa. 2D1 was part of a 220-kDa complex in the first dimension, suggesting an association between 2D1 and coupled dimeric Porin. ANT1 and Porin monomers (35 and 31 kDa, respectively) also interacted in a 75-kDa complex. Fig. 4C shows a 2D gel obtained under the same conditions as above, except that proteins were detected with Sypro Ruby. Two spots analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry contained mainly ANT1 and Porin (VDAC1) monomers in this 75-kDa complex (Xcorr and sequence recognized for ANT1 from NCBI: 2.614, R.AAYFGVYDTAK.G; VDAC1: 3.36, K.SENGLEFTSSGSANT). To study the relationship between the oligomeric state of ANT and mitochondrial respiration, we used digitonin (3 g/g) to solubilize mitochondrial proteins from muscle, heart, and kidney in various respiratory steady-states (pyruvate-malate, succinate, and ascorbate-TMPD), as well as in the presence of an uncoupler CCCP, and carried out the same 2D gel analysis (Fig. 5A). In muscle mitochondria on pyruvate-malate, there were greater amounts of M1 and 2D1 than dimers D1 (Fig. 5B). When the respiratory state was changed by replacing pyruvate with succinate, the proportion of 2D1 increased (2D1/Porin ratio, 0.58 ± 0.15 to 0.94 ± 0.18). When the flux was further increased on ascorbate-TMPD, M1 was no longer observed, whereas 2D1 increased strongly compared with D1. It is noteworthy that the addition of carbonylcyanid-m-chlorophenylhydrazon resulted in the uncoupling of respiration and the dissociation of all oligomeric forms of ANT1 and Porin. Indeed, 2D1 was not detectable after carbonylcyanid-m-chlorophenylhydrazon addition, whereas M1 increased considerably compared with what was observed on pyruvate-malate (Fig. 5A). Under these conditions, D1 was mainly associated with Porin, but also in a free state (35 kDa). Moreover, D1 was completely dissociated from the macrocomplex (>300 kDa) in muscle. ANT1/Porin ratios remained constant in a given tissue, irrespective of the respiratory substrates. We compared these results on muscle with those obtained on heart and kidney mitochondria. In the heart, D1 and M1 forms were present but not 2D1. In the kidney, the amounts of 2D1 and D1 were similar, whereas M1 was absent or undetectable (Fig. 5B). Moreover, there was no change in the proportion of each form in heart as in kidney according to the different substrates. We conclude that the distribution of ANT1 oligomers depends on tissue type as well as monomer recruitment. ANT1 Associated in the Mitochondrial Permeability Tran"
https://openalex.org/W1963796006,"Previous studies have shown that the promoter of the type II TGF-β receptor gene (<i>T</i>β<i>R-II</i>) is strongly stimulated by Elf3, a member of the Ets transcription factor family. The <i>T</i>β<i>R-II</i> gene behaves as a tumor suppressor and it is expressed in nearly all cell types, whereas Elf3 is expressed primarily in epithelial cells. Hence, the <i>T</i>β<i>R-II</i> gene is likely to be regulated by other Ets proteins in nonepithelial cells. In this study, we examined the effects of four other Ets family members (Ets1, Ets2, PEA3, and PU.1) on <i>T</i>β<i>R-II</i> promoter/reporter constructs that contain the two essential <i>ets</i> sites of this gene. These studies employed F9 embryonal carcinoma cells and their differentiated cells, because transcription of the <i>T</i>β<i>R-II</i> gene increases after F9 cells differentiate. Here we demonstrate that Ets2, which is expressed in F9-differentiated cells along with Elf3, does not stimulate or bind to the <i>T</i>β<i>R-II</i> promoter in these cells. In contrast, PEA3 stimulates the <i>T</i>β<i>R-II</i> promoter in F9-differentiated cells, but it inhibits this promoter in F9 cells. Thus, the effects of PEA3 on the <i>T</i>β<i>R-II</i> promoter are cell context-dependent. We also show that the effects of Elf3 are cell context-dependent. Elf3 strongly stimulates the <i>T</i>β<i>R-II</i> promoter in F9-differentiated cells, but not in F9 cells. In contrast to Elf3 and PEA3, Ets1 strongly stimulates this promoter in both F9 cells and F9-differentiated cells. Finally, we show that PU.1 exerts little or no effect on the activity of the <i>T</i>β<i>R-II</i> promoter. Together, our findings indicate that Elf3 is not the only Ets protein capable of stimulating the <i>T</i>β<i>R-II</i> promoter. Importantly, our findings also indicate that each of the five Ets proteins influences the <i>T</i>β<i>R-II</i> promoter in a unique manner because of important differences in their biochemical properties or their patterns of cellular expression."
https://openalex.org/W2108679917,"Gab1 is a scaffolding/docking protein that has been suggested to play a role in signal transduction downstream of certain plasma membrane receptors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors. We found that PDGF induced a rapid Gab1 phosphorylation, which depended on the recruitment of Grb2, indicating that Grb2 acts as a bridge between Gab1 and the PDGF β-receptor. PDGF also enhanced the binding of Gab1 to the phosphatase SHP-2, but not to p85. To further study the role of Gab1 in PDGF signaling, we transfected porcine aortic endothelial cells with a doxycycline-inducible Gab1 construct. Increased Gab1 expression enhanced the recruitment and activation of SHP-2, as well as the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk and p38 by PDGF. Gab1 expression also enhanced the formation of lamellipodia and cellular protrusions. In Gab1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the same phenotype was induced by restoring the expression of wild-type Gab1, but not a mutant Gab1 that was unable to associate with SHP-2. These effects of PDGF on the actin cytoskeleton were not altered by the inhibition of p38 or Erk, but could be blocked by a dominant-negative form of Rac (Asn17). Finally, Gab1-deficient fibroblasts showed a decreased chemotactic response toward gradients of PDGF as compared with wild-type cells. In conclusion, Gab1 plays a selective role in the regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk and p38 downstream of the PDGF β-receptor, and contributes to cytoskeletal reorganization and chemotaxis in response to PDGF.

Upon ligand binding, PDGF receptors are phosphorylated and interact with at least 11 different types of Src homology (SH)2 domain-containing signaling molecules (reviewed in Ref. 1Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). These signaling proteins include the SH2-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP-2), phospholipase Cγ, the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the tyrosine kinase Src, the transcription factor Stat5, and the adaptor proteins Grb2 and Shc. In addition, many of these mediators also interact with large scaffolding proteins, which are recruited to the receptor complex and phosphorylated on multiple tyrosines. One such scaffolding protein is Gab1, which contains a PH-domain that binds to phosphatidylinositol-trisphosphate in the plasma membrane and is important for correct subcellular localization of Gab1 (2Nishida K.

This interaction allows the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1, which is required for the recruitment of downstream SH2-domain-containing proteins. The most prominent down-stream interaction partners described for Gab1 so far are p85 and SHP-2 (10Rodrigues G.A. Falasca M. Zhang Z. Ong S.H. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell.

The association of p85 with Gab1 plays an important role in the activation of PI3K and its downstream effectors by EGF (10Rodrigues G.A. Falasca M. Zhang Z. Ong S.H. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell.

Gab1-null mice die in utero and show a phenotype reminiscent of the those of mice lacking functional HGF, PDGF, and EGF signaling pathways and with developmental defects in heart, placenta, and skin (14Itoh M.

These observations, and the fact that not much is known about the importance of Gab1 downstream of PDGF receptors, led us to investigate the role of Gab1 in PDGF signaling. We observed that Gab1 was activated by PDGF stimulation, which induced the association of Gab1 with SHP-2, but not with p85, in contrast to what was reported in response to HGF and EGF. Using cells in which Gab1 expression is inducible, we could demonstrate that Gab1 phosphorylation is linked to the activation of Erk-1, Erk-2, and p38. Our data point to a role for Gab1 in cell motility, but not in the mitogenic response of cells to PDGF. Cell Culture—PAE TetON cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% Tet system approved FBS (Clontech) and l-glutamine. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were grown in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and l-glutamine, and COS1 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. For starvation, both PAE and MEFs were washed in plain F-12 medium and then incubated in F-12 medium containing 0.1% of essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) and l-glutamine for 24 h. COS1 cells were washed in DMEM and then starved in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies toward phosphotyrosine (pTyr99), PDGFRβ (958), Gab1 (H-189), SHP-2 (C-18 and N-16), Stat5 (N-20), and Akt1/2 (H-136) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-HA antibodies were from Roche Diagnostic Corporation; anti-phosphorylated (pThr202/pTyr204) Erk-1 and -2, anti-phosphorylated (pSer473) Akt, anti-p38, anti-phosphorylated (pTyr694) Stat5, anti-phosphorylated (pTyr705) Stat3, and anti-Stat3 were from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-phosphorylated (pThr180/pTyr182) p38 was from BIO-SOURCE. Antiserum recognizing Erk-2 was raised as described previously (16Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence also, anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used, together with secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (Dako), 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid (AMCA)-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). Doxycycline hydrochloride was purchased from Sigma. U0126 and SB203580 were obtained from Calbiochem.

Clones were screened for doxycycline-regulated Gab1 expression by Western blotting with HA-antibodies. The Y627F/Y659F mutant HA-Gab1 in pcDNA3 was created using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The oligonucleotides used were GGA GAC AAA CAG GTG GAA TTC TTA GAT CTC GAC TTA GAT and ATC TAA GTC GAG ATC TAA GAA TTC CAC CTG TTT GTC TCC for the Y627F mutation. For the Y659F mutant, the oligonucleotides AGA TGA GAG AGT GGA TTT TGT TGT TGT TGA CCA AC and GTT GGT CAA CAA CAA CAA CAA AAT CCA CTC TCT CAT CT were used. For the creation of the ΔGBS1 mutant, Gab1 oligonucleotides GCA GAC TGT GAA CCA AAC CTC AAG CCA GAC and GTC TGG CTT GAG GTT TGG TTC ACA GTC TGC were used, and for the ΔGBS2 mutant, CTA TTC CAG ATA TTC CTA AAC CAC ATC CAG CTC A and TGA GCT GGA TGT GGT TTA GGA ATA TCT GGA ATA G were used. Myc-tagged, dominant-negative Asn17-Rac was a kind gift from Ninna Richnau and Pontus Aspenström. All transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus™ (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—After starvation in 0.1% BSA overnight, cells were treated with 50 ng/ml of PDGF-BB for different time periods or left untreated. Cells were then washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1% Trasylol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 500 μm Na3VO4. Incubations with antibodies were performed overnight in the cold, protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and incubation was prolonged with end-over-end mixing for 2 h. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and once in distilled H2O, boiled with sample buffer containing dithiothreitol, and eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE. To isolate the PDGFRβ, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the lysates, and samples were incubated end-over-end in the cold for 2 h. The samples were then washed and treated as described for immunoprecipitates. For Western blotting, samples were electro-transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, which were blocked in 5% milk powder (anti-phospho-site-specific antibodies) or 5% BSA (other antibodies) in Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.1% Tween 20. Primary antibodies were used at concentrations recommended by the suppliers in the same buffer and in overnight incubations in the cold. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (both from Amersham Biosciences), and proteins were visualized using ECL Western blotting detection systems from either Roche Applied Science or Santa Cruz Biotechnology on a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Fuji). Quantifications were done using Aida image analyzer software, version 3.10. GST Pull-down Experiments—For GST pull-down experiments, lysates from COS1 cells were incubated with 3 μg of each GST fusion protein, glutathione-Sepharose beads were then added, and tubes were incubated end-over-end in the cold. After extensive washing, the beads were treated like protein A-Sepharose beads during immunoprecipitation, as described above. In Figs. 3, 4, 5, lanes marked “lysate” were loaded with a volume of lysate equal to 5% of the amount taken for each pull-down.Fig. 4Gab1 over-expression enhances Erk and p38 phosphorylation in response to PDGF. A, WGA-Sepharose was used to isolate PDGFRβ from PAE/Rβ/Gab1 cells treated as described for Fig. 3A. Proteins were eluted from the beads after extensive washing and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-PDGFRβ antibodies. Total cell lysates were also analyzed with antibodies against phosphorylated (pThr202/pTyr204) Erk-1/2, and Erk-2 (B); against phosphorylated (pSer473) Akt1/2, and Akt1/2 (C); or against phosphorylated (pThr180/pTyr182) p38 and p38 (D).

Protein A-Sepharose was added and the beads were washed extensively in lysis buffer. The beads with bound SHP-2 were then incubated in 50 mm sodium 4-nitrophenyl-phosphate (Fluka Chemie AG) for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.2 m NaOH, and the optical density (OD) of the solution was read at 410 nm. Data are shown as fold increase of OD after PDGF stimulation. Immunofluorescence—Cells were seeded on cover slips and starved, then pretreated and stimulated as described in legends to Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. For transient transfection of cells with different forms of Gab1 and Asn17-Rac, LipofectAMINE Plus™ (Invitrogen) was used according to manufacturer's instructions. After stimulation, cells were fixed in PBS containing 2.7% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times in ice-cold PBS and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS for 5 mins. After washing in PBS, the cells were blocked in 5% FBS in PBS for 1 h. The coverslips were then exposed consecutively to primary and secondary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 5% FBS, overnight and for 1 h, respectively, at 4 °C. Coverslips were washed and mounted using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnologies Associated, Inc) and photographed with a Hamamatsu ORCA charge-coupled device digital camera, using the QED imaging system software with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope.Fig. 2The Gab1-Grb2 interaction is required for PDGF-induced Gab1 phosphorylation. COS1 cells were transfected with PDGFRβ and either wild-type or mutant HA-Gab1, as indicated. After starvation, cells were either stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 8 min or left untreated, and then lysed. One fraction of the lysates was used for immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies and the other was used for WGA precipitation. After SDS-PAGE separation and electrotransfer, the PVDF-membranes were probed sequentially with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-HA antibodies (HA immunoprecipitates) or with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-PDGFRβ antibodies (WGA precipitates).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6Expression of wild-type Gab1 causes an increase in lamellipodia formation and cellular protrusions in response to PDGF. A, PAE/Rβ/Gab1 cells on coverslips were treated or not with doxycycline for 48 h, starved and stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 8 mins, or left untreated, and then fixed. Cells were stained with anti-HA-FITC antibodies (green) for induced HA-Gab1 and with phalloidin-TRITC (red) for F-actin. Arrowheads point at parts of the Gab1 over-expressing cells which show strong lamellipodia formation (200× magnification; bar,20 μm). B, COS1 cells were transfected with PDGFRβ and either wild-type, Y627F, Y659F, or Y627F/Y659F HA-Gab1. After starvation, cells were stimulated or not with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 8 mins and lysed. Gab1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-HA, or anti-SHP-2 antibodies. C, Gab1-/- MEFs and COS1 cells were transiently transfected with either wt Gab1 or a mutant Gab1 unable to bind SHP-2 (Y627F/Y659F) on coverslips. Cells were starved and then stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 8 mins, or left untreated, and then fixed. The cells were then stained using anti-HA-FITC antibodies and phalloidin-TRITC. Arrowheads show cellular protrusions where both F-actin (red, in the form of lamellipodia) and HA-Gab1 (green) localize at the plasma membrane (630× magnification; bar, 20 μm). D, PAE/Rβ/Gab1 cells were transiently transfected with Myc-tagged Asn17-Rac1 on coverslips and treated with 200 ng/ml doxycycline for 48 h. After starvation, cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 8 mins and then fixed. Cells were stained with anti-HA antibodies coupled to FITC (green), phalloidin-TRITC (red), and anti-Myc-AMCA (blue). Arrowheads point at protrusions with accumulated Gab1 and F-actin at the membrane of a cell over-expressing HA-Gab1 but not expressing Asn17-Rac1, whereas none of the Asn17-Rac-positive cells show any sign of these protrusions (630× magnification; bar, 20 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Gab1 Associates with SHP-2 and Grb2, but Not with p85, upon PDGF Stimulation—To study the role of Gab1 in PDGF signaling, we first analyzed the association of Gab1 with other proteins in PAE cells expressing PDGFRβ at a physiological level. By immunoprecipitation, we observed a consistent phosphorylation of Gab1 on tyrosine residues in response to PDGF-BB stimulation as monitored by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 1A). PDGF stimulation also caused a shift in the apparent molecular mass of the protein as detected by immunoblotting with Gab1 antibodies (Fig. 1A). These observations are in line with previously published work using other cell lines (14Itoh M. Yoshida Y. Nishida K. Narimatsu M. Hibi M. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3695-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). SHP-2 was also phosphorylated in response to PDGF, and both SHP-2 and Grb2 co-precipitated with Gab1 upon PDGF stimulation, but p85 and PDGFRβ were not detectable in Gab1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1A). Instead, p85 strongly associated with phosphorylated PDGFRβ, as shown by immunoprecipitations of either of these two proteins. These findings suggest that activated PDGFRβ interacts directly with p85, as described before (6Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 20Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), and indirectly with Gab1. SHP-2 also bound to Gab1 and to a phosphorylated component of a size corresponding to PDGFRβ (see phosphotyrosine blot, Fig. 1), which is consistent with previous work showing that SHP-2 interacts with PDGFRβ (21Rönnstrand L. Arvidsson A.-K. Kallin A. Rorsman C. Hellman U. Engström U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Grb2 Binding Is Required for Gab1 Phosphorylation and Association with PDGFRβ —Previous reports indicated that Grb2 binds constitutively to Gab1. Using pull-down experiments with immobilized recombinant GST-Grb2 chimeras and lysates from COS cells transfected with HA-tagged Gab1 and PDGFRβ, we showed that Gab1 interacted with the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 but not with its SH2 domain or the N-terminal SH3 domain (data not shown), as described by others (8Lock L.S. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31536-31545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To determine the role of Grb2 in Gab1 activation, we investigated the ability of PDGF to induce phosphorylation of Gab1 mutants in which one or both of the Grb2 binding sequences (GBS1 and GBS2) were deleted. As analyzed by transfection in COS cells, deletion of either of the Grb2 binding sites decreased the effect of PDGF on Gab1 phosphorylation and abolished the co-precipitation of Gab1 and phosphorylated PDGFRβ, which was occasionally seen in both transfected COS cells and cells expressing endogenous levels of proteins (Fig. 2). Removal of both Grb2 binding sites abolished the effect of PDGF on Gab1 phosphorylation. These observations indicate that Grb2 is required for Gab1 recruitment to the PDGFRβ complex and its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. Gab1 Expression Leads to Increased SHP-2 Recruitment and Activation of SHP-2 Phosphatase Activity—To study the effect of Gab1 in PDGF signaling, we established a Gab1-inducible system in PAE cells stably expressing human PDGFRβ. Several different clones of cells expressing inducible Gab1 were selected, and one was chosen for further use, from now on referred to as PAE/Rβ/Gab1. Treatment of the cells with 200 ng/ml doxycycline for 2 days induced expression of exogenous HA-Gab1 to about five times the endogenous levels as determined by densitometric analysis of the Gab1 immunoblot in Fig. 1. At this concentration, doxycycline had no effect on control cells. PAE/Rβ/Gab1 cells grown in the absence or presence of doxycycline were stimulated with PDGF for different time periods, and the kinetics of Gab1 phosphorylation were studied after immunoprecipitation with Gab1 antibodies (Fig. 1A, upper panels). Both endogenous Gab1, as well as induced, exogenous HA-Gab1, were rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to PDGF. The amount of PDGF-induced co-immunoprecipitation with SHP-2 was increased in doxycycline-treated cells, whereas the association between Gab1 and the regulatory subunit p85 of PI3K remained unaffected by both ligand stimulation and doxycycline treatment (Fig. 3A, middle panels). The amount of HA-Gab1 expression in the absence of doxycycline was not detectable, as seen in the immunoblot using anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3A, lower panel). It is known that the PDGFRβ interacts directly with SHP-2 (21Rönnstrand L. Arvidsson A.-K. Kallin A. Rorsman C. Hellman U. Engström U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To examine whether the increased association between Gab1 and SHP-2 has any effect on this interaction, we immunoprecipitated SHP-2 from PAE/Rβ/Gab1 cells and analyzed the precipitates for the presence of PDGFRβ. As shown in Fig. 3B, there was no change in the amount of co-immunoprecipitating PDGFRβ in response to Gab1 expression, as seen by anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-PDGFRβ immunoblotting. It has been proposed that one major function of Gab1 is to bring SHP-2 to the membrane, where it then can be activated and exert its function (4Cunnick J.M. Meng S. Ren Y. Desponts C. Wang H.G. Djeu J.Y. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9498-9504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We used the PAE/Rβ/Gab1 cells treated with and without doxycycline and with and without PDGF-BB, in a phosphatase assay, to elucidate whether PDGF-induced SHP-2 activity was elevated by Gab1 over-expression. As seen in Fig. 3C, the phosphatase activity doubled upon doxycycline treatment. In a control experiment, no effect of Gab1 overexpression was seen on phosphorylation and degradation of the PDGFRβ in PAE/Rβ/Gab1 cells (Fig. 4A), which argues that the differences caused by doxycycline treatment are indeed downstream of the receptor itself. In conclusion, SHP-2 recruitment to Gab1 increased when the expression of the latter was induced, resulting in increased SHP-2 activity. Expression of Gab1 Increases both PDGF-induced Erk and p38 Activation—We next tested whether increasing Gab1 expression affected PDGF signaling. As shown in Fig. 4, Gab1 induction caused a pronounced increase in Erk-1 and Erk-2 phosphorylation in response to PDGF, but did not change the phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream effector of PI3K, in agreement with our observations that PDGF did not promote the association of p85 with Gab1. We also investigated whether Gab1 regulated the activity of other MAPK family members besides Erk. Using an antibody specific for activated p38, we found that Gab1 over-expression also caused an increased activation of this MAPK in response to PDGF. Stat3 and Stat5 have previously been reported to be activated during PDGF signaling (reviewed in Ref. 1Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). In addition, Stat5 has been shown to be a SHP-2 substrate (22Chen Y. Wen R. Yang S. Schuman J. Zhang E.E. Yi T. Feng G.S. Wang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16520-16527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Analysis of PDGF-induced Stat3 and Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation in PAE/Rβ/Gab1 cells revealed that Gab1 over-expression had no effect upon Stat3 activation (Fig. 5) but decreased Stat5 phosphorylation, which is in line with the observations that Stat5 is a substrate for SHP-2 (23Yu C.L. Jin Y.J. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 599-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), whose phosphatase activity was elevated under these conditions (Fig. 3). Gab1 Contributes to Membrane Ruffling and Cellular Protrusions in Response to PDGF—Gab1 has been proposed to be required for HGF-induced branching tubulogenesis and changes in cell morphology (24Rosario M. Birchmeier W. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 328-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To see if there is any effect of Gab1 on PDGF-induced actin reorganization and cell morphology, we studied PAE/Rβ/Gab1 cells grown in the presence or absence of doxycycline. Fixation and actin staining of the cells revealed that the doxycycline-treated cells displayed a much more prominent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton after PDGF stimulation, as compared with control cells which did not over-express Gab1 (Fig. 6A). It should be noted that Gab1 overexpression did not induce any change in the actin cytoskeleton in the absence of PDGF (data not shown). Next, we transiently transfected Gab1-/- MEFs with either wild-type or a mutant form of Gab1, Y627F/Y659F, which was shown to be unable to bind to SHP-2 (Fig. 6B and Ref. 25Cunnick J.M. Mei L. Doupnik C.A. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24380-24387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Reconstituting wild-type Gab1 in these cells caused an increased responsiveness to PDGF in terms of formation of lamellipodia and cellular protrusions, whereas the Y627F/Y659F mutant gave no such effect. Also, expression of PDGFRβ together with wild-type Gab1 in COS1 cells showed enhanced actin reorganization, whereas expression of the Y627F/Y659F gave no similar effect in response to PDGF treatment (Fig. 6C). The formation of lamellipodia is dependent upon Rac activity (3Maroun C.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and hence we wanted to investigate the role of Rac in PDGF-induced Gab1 signaling. PAE/Rβ/Gab1 cells, therefore, were transiently transfected with the dominant-negative (Asn17) form of Rac1 (Fig. 6D). Among cells over-expressing Gab1 in response to doxycycline, those transfected with Asn17-Rac showed no sign of membrane ruffling and formation of protrusions in response to PDGF stimulation, whereas cells not transfected with Asn17-Rac showed protrusions with lamellipodia as expected. Because Gab1 enhanced p38 activation in response to PDGF, we investigated whether p38 activity was required for the effect seen on the cytoskeleton and cell morphology of PAE/Rβ/Gab1 cells. Incubation in the presence of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 caused no major effect on the degree of lamellipodia formation and cellular protrusions in response to PDGF-BB (data not shown), implying that p38 is not essential for PDGF-induced actin reorganization. Gab1 Levels do Not Influence Mitogenicity, but Gab1-/- MEFs Show Decreased Chemotactic Response to PDGF—To elucidate whether Gab1 has any effect upon the mitogenic response to PDGF, we subjected PAE/Rβ/Gab1 cells to a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay (Fig. 7). Neither the response to PDGF nor to serum was changed by the over-expression of Gab1. Thus, increased Gab1 levels do not increase mitogenicity in these cells. The PDGF-dependent increase in cytoskeletal reorganization after Gab1 induction caused us to inquire whether the chemotactic response to PDGF could also be affected by Gab1. Gab1-/- MEFs showed a reduced migratory response in the presence of PDGF compared with Gab1+/+ cells, both on fibronectin and collagen substrates (Fig. 8A). The chemotactic response of these two cell lines to serum was comparable on both substrates (Fig. 8B), indicating that Gab1 deficiency caused a specific decrease in PDGF-induced chemotaxis. In this study, we analyzed the interactions of Gab1 with Grb2 and SHP-2 downstream of the PDGFRβ, and investigated the role of Gab1 in PDGF signaling. We first focused on the role of Grb2 in the Gab1 complex. As described by others (8Lock L.S. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31536-31545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), Grb2 binding to Gab1 depended upon the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 and upon two proline-rich motifs in Gab1. We showed that mutation of these two Grb2-binding motifs prevented the co-immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated PDGFRβ with Gab1. Because the SH2 domain of Grb2 is known to interact directly with the PDGFRβ, and indirectly via Shc and SHP-2 (reviewed in Ref. 1Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar), it is likely that Grb2 acts as a bridge between PDGFRβ and Gab1. Interestingly, we observed that the PH domain of Gab1 was also required for Gab1 phosphorylation upon PDGF stimulation (data not shown), possibly because that domain is necessary for proper Gab1 localization. Besides Grb2, SHP-2 was also associated with Gab1 in response to PDGF treatment. This interaction required the two SH2 domains of SHP-2 (data not shown) and Tyr627 and Tyr659 of Gab1. By contrast to what was shown in different models, mutation of Tyr627 alone was not enough to disrupt Gab1 binding to SHP-2 (26Cai T. Nishida K. Hirano T. Khavari P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recruitment of SHP-2 to Gab1 was reported to increase SHP-2 phosphatase activity, which, in turn, enhances the activation of Erk (25Cunnick J.M. Mei L. Doupnik C.A. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24380-24387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In line with this report, we observed that Gab1 over-expression increased the activation of SHP-2, Erk-1, and Erk-2 by PDGF. In addition, p38 phosphorylation was also increased upon PDGF treatment. The co-regulation of Erk and p38 was not surprising, because both seem to depend upon Ras activation in PAE cells (27Matsumoto T. Yokote K. Tamura K. Takemoto M. Ueno S. Saito Y. Mori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13954-13960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The importance of Gab1 as a regulator of MAPK activation downstream the PDGFRβ was confirmed by analyzing Gab1-deficient MEF clones, which showed a reduced activation of p38, Erk-1, and Erk-2 in response to PDGF, compared with wild-type cells 2A. Kallin, unpublished data. (14Itoh M. Yoshida Y. Nishida K. Narimatsu M. Hibi M. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3695-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Erk activation by PDGF also depends upon direct recruitment of SHP-2 to PDGFRβ (21Rönnstrand L. Arvidsson A.-K. Kallin A. Rorsman C. Hellman U. Engström U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In conclusion, Gab1 may act as an enhancer of SHP-2 activity, and it potentiates the activation of Erk and p38 by PDGF. We did not find any PDGF-dependent increase in the association between Gab1 and p85, as opposed to what was found in the context of NGF and HGF signaling. Consistent with this finding, Akt phosphorylation was not affected by Gab1 overexpression. The lack of connection between the PI3K pathway and Gab1 downstream of PDGFRβ might be explained by dephosphorylation of the p85 docking sites of Gab1 by SHP-2, as reported by Zhang et al. (28Zhang S.Q. Tsiaras W.G. Araki T. Wen G. Minichiello L. Klein R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4062-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Gab1 over-expression in PAE cells did not increase the mitogenic activity of PDGF, but it dramatically enhanced cytoskeletal reorganization. Because of clonal variations, it was not possible to compare Gab1-deficient MEFs with wild-type controls. However, restoration of Gab1 expression in Gab1-deficient clones dramatically enhanced the formation of lamellipodia and cellular protrusions in response to PDGF. This effect was prevented by mutation of Tyr627 and Tyr659 of Gab1, pointing to the involvement of SHP-2. Surprisingly, blocking Erk and p38 activation by specific inhibitors did not affect actin reorganization by PDGF, in contrast to what had been shown by others in PAE cells (27Matsumoto T. Yokote K. Tamura K. Takemoto M. Ueno S. Saito Y. Mori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13954-13960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The formation of lamellipodia is known to be dependent upon the activation of the small Rho-GTPase Rac, and the introduction of dominant-negative Asn17-Rac abolished the increased actin reorganization seen with Gab1 induction. It is not clear, however, whether Gab1 regulates the activation of Rac, or whether Rac takes part in a parallel pathway that is also required for lamellipodia formation upon PDGF treatment. Future studies will have to determine which is the molecular link between the Gab1-SHP-2 complex and actin reorganization. Finally, we showed that Gab1-deficient fibroblasts exhibited a slightly decreased chemotactic response compared with wild-type cells in response to PDGF. This finding is consistent with the notion that Gab1 regulates the organization of the cell cytoskeleton, which plays a key role in cell migration. However, in PAE cells over-expressing Gab1, we saw no enhanced chemotaxis (data not shown), possibly because the endogenous level of Gab1 was sufficient for optimal migration, or because an exaggerated cytoskeletal reorganization disturbed the process of directed cell migration. Previously, we showed that mutation of SHP-2-binding sites in PDGFRβ decreased the chemotactic response toward gradients of PDGF (21Rönnstrand L. Arvidsson A.-K. Kallin A. Rorsman C. Hellman U. Engström U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which supports the involvement of SHP-2 in this process. In conclusion, we show that PDGF induces the phosphorylation of Gab1 in a Grb2-dependent manner, leading to increased activation of SHP-2 and Erk and p38. In addition, we provide evidence for a role for Gab1 in reorganization of the cytoskeleton and chemotaxis downstream of PDGFRβ."

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 699-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In addition to clathrin, the Golgi- and plasma membrane-derived CCVs contain the adaptor protein (AP) complexes AP-1 and AP-2, respectively, as the principal coat proteins. The heterotetrameric AP complexes are comprised of two large adaptin subunits (γ and β1 for AP-1, α, and β2 for AP-2), which can be subdivided into an N-terminal trunk domain and a C-terminal appendage or ear domain linked by an extended flexible hinge, a medium adaptin subunit (μ1 or μ2), and a small adaptin subunit (σ1 or σ2). Electron microscopic images of purified AP-2 heterotetramers reveal two separate globular appendages, which correspond to the C-terminal portions of the large α and β2 chains, projecting from the central core of the complex. The AP-1 γ and β1-appendages are believed to have an analogous gross structure (2Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In addition to the AP complexes, the two subtypes of coated vesicles contain an array of distinct and, to a small degree, overlapping protein components that contribute to cargo selection and facilitate CCV formation by combining clathrin-binding and membrane association domains within an oligomeric protein complex. Among these are the accessory proteins eps15, epsin, amphiphysin, AP-180, auxillin, numb, and disabled-2, which function at the plasma membrane (3Traub L.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and the GGAs (Golgi-associated γ-adaptin-related ADP-ribosylation factor-binding proteins), which are involved in vesicle budding from the TGN. The three mammalian GGAs are multidomain proteins that were identified on the basis of sequence similarity between the AP-1 γ-appendage domain and the C-terminal 150 amino acids of these proteins, also known as the γ-adaptin ear (GAE) domain (4Poussu A.

This domain is linked to the GAT domain by a flexible hinge region that interacts with clathrin (9Puertollano R. Randazzo P.A. Presley J.F. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S.

The N-terminal region contains a VHS domain that has been shown to be important in the sorting of transmembrane proteins having acidic cluster-dileucine (AC-LL) signals, such as the mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) and sortilin, from the TGN to endosomes (10Zhu Y.

In the case of the MPRs, interaction with GGAs is critical for the efficient delivery of acid hydrolases to lysosomes (14Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18477-18482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the GGAs and AP-1, along with MPRs, colocalize in clathrin-coated buds at the TGN of mouse L cells and human HeLa cells (15Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We further showed a direct interaction between the hinge domains of the GGAs and the γ-ear domain of AP-1. In the case of GGA1, our in vitro binding data implicated residues 370–429 in the hinge segment as being important for its interaction with the AP-1 γ-ear. Moreover, a mutant MPR that was defective in binding the GGAs was poorly incorporated into AP-1 CCVs, suggesting that the GGAs and AP-1 cooperate to package MPRs into coated vesicles at the TGN. Thus, the in vitro interactions that we observed between the GGAs and AP-1 may be physiologically important in ensuring proper transfer of the MPRs from the GGAs to AP-1. In the current study, we sought to identify the sequence in the GGA1 hinge that is responsible for its association with AP-1. We show that the interaction between the AP-1 γ-ear and GGA1 is mediated by a WNSF sequence (residues 382–385) within the hinge region of GGA1 and that the 2 anchor aromatic amino acids constitute key residues. A functionally analogous WXX(F/W) sequence found in the proteins NECAP1 and amphiphysin II also mediates their interactions with the AP-1 γ-ear. Materials and Antibodies—COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone™ Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT). Sf9 insect cells were maintained in the Sf-900II SFM medium (Invitrogen) containing 25 units/ml penicillin, 25 μg/ml streptomycin. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The anti-c-myc (clone-9E10) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), whereas the anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal was from Covance (Berkeley, CA). The anti-Rabaptin5 and anti-Xpress monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories and Invitrogen, respectively. The anti-AP-1 γ-subunit-specific monoclonal antibody (100/3) was from Sigma. Frozen bovine adrenal glands were purchased from Pel-Freez (Rogers, AR). Plasmid Construction and cDNA Cloning—The plasmids encoding GST-AP-1 γ-ear (residues 703–822), GST-SIPWDLWTTS (the distal amphiphysin II clathrin-binding sequence), and myc-GGA1pCR3.1 have been described (10Zhu Y.

GST-GGA1-(376–391) was generated by annealing sense and antisense oligonucleotides and ligating the double-stranded product into EcoRI/XhoI-digested pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences). His-Xpress-γ-ear-(703–822) was constructed by PCR of the corresponding γ-ear coding sequence from GST-γ-ear-(703–822)pGEX-5X-3 (16Doray B. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1925-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and ligation into the vector pTrcHisC (Invitrogen). Human NECAP1 was cloned from a brain cDNA library (Clontech) using primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the published hNECAP1 sequence (GenBank™ accession number AK074880) into the TA-cloning vector (Invitrogen). The cloned cDNA was sequenced in its entirety to ascertain the identity of the cloned product. GST-hNECAP1 was generated by PCR and ligation into EcoRI-digested pGEX-5X-3. The various GST-AP-1 γ-ear, myc-GGA1pCR3.1, GST-hNECAP1, and GST-SIPWDLWTTS mutant constructs were made using primers incorporating the desired mutations with the QuikChange system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs and mutations were confirmed to be correct by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Peptides—The amino acid sequences derived from the GGA1 hinge region (376–391) corresponding to the peptides used in this study are as follows: SLDGTGWNSFQSSDAT, termed GGA1WnsF peptide; SLDGTGANSAQSSDAT, termed GGA1AnsA peptide; SLDGTGFNSFQSSDAT, termed GGA1FnsF peptide. All peptides were synthesized at the Protein Chemistry Laboratory at Washington University in St. Louis, MO and purified by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Protein Expression and Purification—myc-GGA1 (WT and mutants) were expressed in SF9 insect cells, and cell lysates were prepared as described previously (18Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed into cold assay buffer A (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 125 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.4% Triton X-100) by sonication. Following centrifugation at 20,000 × g, the supernatant containing the GGA protein was stored at -80 °C for use in the binding assays. All lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g immediately prior to use in pull-down experiments. Bovine adrenal cytosol was prepared essentially as described (19Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4933-4942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) except that frozen glands, instead of fresh tissue, were used. The various glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(RIL) cells and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose affinity column as described (16Doray B. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1925-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). His-myc-GGA1 and His-Xpress-γ-ear-(703–822) were expressed in SF9 insect cells and E. coli BL21(RIL) cells, respectively, and purified on a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) as per the manufacturers protocol. Briefly, the Ni-NTA beads were washed and equilibrated with binding buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4) before incubating the His-myc-GGA1-containing insect cell lysate or the His-Xpress-γ-ear- (703–822) containing bacterial lysate in the same buffer containing 0.4% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C with constant tumbling. Following the overnight incubation, the beads were gently spun down and washed repeatedly with wash buffer (binding buffer with 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4) until there was no detectable protein being released and then incubated for 15 min at room temperature with elution buffer (binding buffer with 300 mm imidazole, pH 7.4). Elutions were repeated three times, and the fractions were pooled, concentrated using a Centricon-10 apparatus, and frozen in aliquots at -80 °C for further use. The concentration of the purified protein was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Binding Assays—GST pull-down experiments were performed with COS cell or insect cell lysates as described (18Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Binding assays using bovine adrenal cytosol were performed in assay buffer B (assay buffer A with 0.1% Triton X-100). The binding reactions were allowed to proceed for 3 h at 4 °C with constant tumbling followed by centrifugation at 750 × g for 1 min. An aliquot of the supernatant was saved, and the pellets were subjected to three washes in 1 ml of cold assay buffer B each time. The pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min before loading. For the peptide inhibition studies, GST pull-down assays were performed similarly except that reactions were carried out in a final volume of 300 μl containing the indicated concentrations of the various peptides. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Pellet and supernatant fractions (as indicated by P and S, respectively, in the figure legends) were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were blocked with TBST (100 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then probed with primary antibodies as indicated in the individual figure legends followed by horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The immunoreactive bands were visualized on x-ray films using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Where necessary, the bands were quantified with the Kodak digital imaging system (Eastman Kodak Co.). GGA1 WXXF Motif Mediates Its Interaction with AP-1—We have previously demonstrated that the hinge region of GGA1 between residues 370 and 429 mediates its interaction with the AP-1 γ-ear (15Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To delineate the precise sequence requirement for AP-1 binding, a number of truncation mutants of myc-tagged GGA1 were expressed in COS-7 cells and tested for binding to GST fused to the AP-1 γ-ear (residues 703–822) in GST pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 1B, left, WT myc-GGA1 and truncations to 410 and 392 bound to GST-γ-ear, but further truncation to residue 387 resulted in the loss of this interaction. This indicated that residues 387SSDAT391 in the hinge region (Fig. 1A) are necessary for interaction in the context of this truncated mutant. Moreover, a mutant with residues 387–391 deleted (Δ387–391) in the full-length GGA1 also failed to bind to the AP-1 γ-ear (Fig. 1B, right). However, when these 5 residues were mutated to Ala in the full-length GGA1 (myc-GGA1 387–391A), normal binding was observed (Fig. 1B, right). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the actual binding motif was likely to be situated proximal to the 387–391 sequence and that truncations or deletions in this region impaired the ability of the binding motif to interact with the AP-1 γ-ear. To test this, a series of alanine mutants was constructed and expressed in COS-7 cells as indicated in Fig. 1B, right. Only the 381–386A mutant failed to bind the AP-1 γ-ear. Mutation of residues 376–380 to Ala had a marginal effect on γ-ear binding, whereas mutation of residues 371–375 to Ala had no detectable effect. Analyses of single alanine substitutions within the GGA1 381–386 segment showed that Trp-382 and Phe-385 are critical for the interaction of GGA1 with the γ-ear domain of AP-1 (Fig. 2). Further, replacement of Trp-382 with Leu, Val, or Phe abolished binding, indicating an absolute requirement for Trp at this position. The Phe at position 385 could be replaced with Trp with only a modest loss of binding, but substitutions with Leu or Val resulted in a complete lack of binding (Fig. 2). To further examine the role of the GGA1 WXXF motif in binding the AP-1 γ-ear, we performed competition studies with a peptide consisting of GGA1 residues 376–391 or a similar peptide with Trp-382 and Phe-385 mutated to Ala. As shown in Fig. 3A, the binding of myc-GGA1 to the GST-γ-ear protein was strongly inhibited by the WT peptide but not the mutated peptide. The inhibition curve shown in Fig. 3B demonstrates that the inhibition is concentration-dependent and occurred with micromolar concentrations of free peptide. Furthermore, a GST fusion protein containing the 16 amino acid residues corresponding to the GGA1 peptide (residues 376–391) was sufficient to pull-down AP-1 from bovine adrenal cytosol, and this interaction was totally abrogated by the addition of the WT peptide (Fig. 3C). This indicates that the WXXF motif of GGA1 is necessary and sufficient to mediate its interaction with the AP-1 γ-ear. WXXF- and FXXΦ-containing Proteins Bind to a Common or Overlapping Site on the AP-1 γ-Ear—Recently, a number of accessory proteins that interact with the appendage domains of AP-1 and the GGA proteins were shown to contain sequences that fit a consensus motif, (D/E)FXXΦ (Φ represents leucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, or methionine) (20Miller G.J. Mattera R. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Collins B.M. Praefcke G.J.K. Robinson M.S. Owen D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Wasiak S. Denisov A.Y. Han Z. Leventis P.A. de Heuvel E. Boulianne G.L. Kay B.K. Gehring K. McPherson P.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These include p56 and Rabaptin5 (Fig. 4A), as well as γ-synergin and EpsinR. The crystal structures of peptides with sequences conforming to this motif, in complex with the GAE domains of GGAs 1 and 3, have revealed the critical nature of the phenylalanine residue in the first position and +3 residue for this interaction (20Miller G.J. Mattera R. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Collins B.M. Praefcke G.J.K. Robinson M.S. Owen D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). On the basis of mutagenesis data coupled with the structural homology between the AP-1 γ-ear and the GGA GAE domains, it appears likely that the accessory protein-binding site on both adaptors is very similar (20Miller G.J. Mattera R. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To assess whether these proteins bind to the same site on the AP-1 γ-ear as does GGA1, we tested the effect of the GGA1 WXXF peptide on the binding of Rabaptin5 to GST-γ-ear. Rabaptin5 contains an FGPLV sequence (Fig. 4A) that interacts with the GGA GAE domain (23Mattera R. Arighi C.N. Lodge R. Zerial M. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, Rabaptin5 binding was strongly inhibited by 0.2 mm WT GGA1 peptide but not by 0.5 mm AXXA mutant peptide. This suggests that the (D/E)FXXΦ and the WXXF motifs bind to a common or closely overlapping site on the AP-1 γ-ear. We next tested whether the FXXΦ peptide (FGGF), derived from the p56 protein GAE-binding sequence, inhibits binding of myc-GGA1 to the AP-1 γ-ear. In competition assays (Fig. 5A), both the GGA and the p56 peptides displayed a similar inhibition profile except that the p56 peptide stimulated binding at the lowest concentration tested (30 μm). This was consistent with both peptides binding to a common or overlapping site on the AP-1 γ-ear. In contrast to this finding with the p56 peptide, the GGA1 mutant FXXF peptide is at least 8-fold less potent than the WT peptide in inhibiting binding of myc-GGA1 to GST-γ-ear (Fig. 5B). The most likely explanation for this difference is that residues in the proximity of the anchor aromatic amino acid influence the predilection for either a Phe or a Trp residue in the first position of the motif. These neighboring residues could possibly impact the specificity of the interactions of different accessory proteins with the GAE domains, as suggested previously (20Miller G.J. Mattera R. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Curiously, the lowest concentration of the GGA1 mutant FXXF peptide stimulated GGA1 binding to the AP-1 γ-ear, just as observed with the p56 peptide. An explanation for this anomaly is not clear at this point. GGA1 WXXF Motif Engages the Same Key Residues in AP-1 γ-Ear as FXXΦ Motif—X-ray crystallography together with structure-based mutational analysis have revealed the binding site for accessory proteins within the AP-1 γ-ear (24Kent H.M. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. Benmerah A. Owen D.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 1139-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Nogi T. Shiba Y. Kawasaki M. Shiba T. Matsugaki N. Igarashi N. Suzuki M. Kato R. Takatsu H. Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 527-531PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure showed the γ-ear domain to consist solely of an immunoglobulin-like fold with several basic and hydrophobic residues that are highly conserved between the γ-ear and GGA GAE domains forming a cluster on the surface of the β-sandwich structure. It has been shown that mutations K756Q, R793Q, R795Q, K797Q, E812K, and L762E in the γ-ear domain abolished its binding to the accessory proteins, γ-synergin and Rabaptin5 (24Kent H.M. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. Benmerah A. Owen D.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 1139-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Nogi T. Shiba Y. Kawasaki M. Shiba T. Matsugaki N. Igarashi N. Suzuki M. Kato R. Takatsu H. Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 527-531PubMed Google Scholar). Since the GGAs also bind to the γ-ear, we wanted to determine whether the GGA-γ-ear interaction required the same structural determinants as did the other accessory proteins. To address this issue, the six mutations described above were introduced into GST-γ-ear, and the recombinant fusion were proteins tested for their ability to pull-down Rabaptin5 and GGA1. The results of the binding assays show that point mutations in 5 of the 6 residues within the γ-ear abolished its binding to GGA1 (Fig. 6). All of these mutants except for K797Q also impaired Rabaptin5 binding. The E812K mutation did not affect the ability of the γ-ear to interact with either GGA1 or Rabaptin5. Thus, with one exception, the same basic and hydrophobic residues on the γ-ear are required for interaction with both Rabaptin5 and GGA1. NECAP and Amphiphysin Bind AP-1 in Vitro through WXX(F/W) Motifs—Two recent reports have identified a novel AP-2 α-appendage-binding sequence, WXX(F/W)X(D/E), that is similar to the WXXF motif described here (26Ritter B. Philie J. Girard M. Tung E.C. Blondeau F. McPherson P.S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1-7Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Jha A. Agostinelli N.R. Mishra S.K. Keyel P.A. Hawryluk M.J. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 2281-2290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the protein NECAP (26Ritter B. Philie J. Girard M. Tung E.C. Blondeau F. McPherson P.S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1-7Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the WXXF sequence is positioned at the extreme C terminus of the protein. Hence, it was proposed that for the NECAP AP-2 α-appendage-interacting motif, the terminal carboxyl group may replace the distal acidic side chain normally seen in the consensus sequence (27Jha A. Agostinelli N.R. Mishra S.K. Keyel P.A. Hawryluk M.J. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 2281-2290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Ritter et al. (26Ritter B. Philie J. Girard M. Tung E.C. Blondeau F. McPherson P.S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1-7Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) also found that the AP-1 γ-ear interacted with NECAP proteins, but this interaction did not require the extreme C-terminal WXXF. Upon examining the NECAP amino acid sequence (Fig. 7A), we observed a second WXXF motif, 252WGDF255, positioned 16 residues proximal to the C-terminal α-appendage-interacting WXXF motif. In view of our finding that the internal WXXF sequence of GGA1 interacted with the AP-1 γ-ear, we reasoned that the proximal WXXF sequence of NECAP1 may represent the γ-ear-interacting motif. To test this, various constructs of GST-NECAP1 were expressed and purified from bacteria for use in pull-down assays with bovine adrenal cytosol as a source of cytosolic AP-1. The results shown in Fig. 7, B and C, indicate that the proximal 252WGDF255 sequence of NECAP is the γ-ear-interacting motif and that it behaves in many respects similar to the GGA1 WXXF sequence. For instance, Trp-252 could not be substituted by either Phe or Ala at this position, but Phe-255 could be substituted by a Trp (Fig. 7C). Moreover, if the protein terminated with the 252WXXF255 sequence (Ser-256 stop), it was unable to bind to the γ-ear, similar to the observation with the GGA1 387 stop mutant. This is in contrast to the findings with the AP-2 α-appendage-interacting WXXF motif, which requires an Asp or Glu in the +5 position (where Trp is the 0 position) or the motif be positioned at the extreme C terminus of the protein (27Jha A. Agostinelli N.R. Mishra S.K. Keyel P.A. Hawryluk M.J. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 2281-2290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the course of characterizing the endocytic interactions between amphiphysin and clathrin, Drake and Traub (17Drake M.T. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28700-28709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) observed that a GST-SIPWDLWEPT peptide fusion harboring the distal amphiphysin II clathrin-binding sequence was able to associate with AP-1 from cytosol. Although these investigators did not ascertain whether the AP-1 binding to GST-SIPWDLWEPT was direct or the indirect consequence of its interaction with clathrin, it was shown that mutation of the proximal Trp to Ala, Phe, Tyr, or His resulted in the loss of AP-1 association. Mutation of the distal Trp to Phe, however, had no effect on AP-1 binding. These results are reminiscent of our data with the GGA1 and NECAP γ-ear-interacting WXXF motifs. Hence, we sought to determine whether the GST-SIPWDLWEPT peptide fusion could associate directly with the AP-1 γ-ear and whether this interaction was dependent on the 2 Trp residues. As shown in Fig. 7D, the Ni-NTA-purified AP-1 γ-ear domain was able to bind directly to the WT GST-SIPWDLWEPT peptide fusion, but binding was severely compromised by mutating the proximal Trp to either an Ala or a Phe. Mutation of the distal Trp to Phe, however, had no detectable effect on the ability of the purified γ-ear to associate with the GST-amphiphysin II peptide fusion, but a Trp to Ala substitution at this position abolished binding. These results lend further support to the concept that the WXX(F/W) motif is a bona fide GAE-binding motif that has distinct characteristics from the (D/E)FXXΦ motif. The data presented in this study establish that the 382WNSF385 sequence within the GGA1 hinge region is responsible for its interaction with the AP-1 γ-ear. Within this sequence, the 2 anchoring aromatic residues are critical determinants of the interaction. Recently, a peptide motif conforming to the consensus sequence, (D/E)FXXΦ (Φ represents leucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan or methionine), has been shown to be a GAE-binding motif (20Miller G.J. Mattera R. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Collins B.M. Praefcke G.J.K. Robinson M.S. Owen D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Wasiak S. Denisov A.Y. Han Z. Leventis P.A. de Heuvel E. Boulianne G.L. Kay B.K. Gehring K. McPherson P.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This motif is found in several accessory proteins that interact with both the AP-1 γ-ear and the GGA GAE domains, including γ-synergin, Rabaptin 5, and EpsinR. Structural studies of peptides containing this motif in complex with the GAE domains of GGAs 1 and 3 show that the peptides bind in an extended conformation to two complementary hydrophobic pockets on the surface between strands β4 and β5 of the GAE domains (20Miller G.J. Mattera R. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Collins B.M. Praefcke G.J.K. Robinson M.S. Owen D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The invariant anchoring phenylalanine residue (position 0), in particular, was observed to make specific hydrophobic contacts within the first pocket with 2 highly conserved arginine residues in the GAE domain. The flatness of both the aromatic ring of the phenylalanine and the guanidino group of the arginine made the resultant stacking interactions highly favorable. The crystal structures also revealed that the more general hydrophobic nature of the second pocket would permit accommodation of bulky hydrophobic residues in position +3. This was consistent with the fact that various bulky hydrophobic residues occupy this position in the GAE-binding motifs of the different accessory proteins. Since the GGA1 WNSF sequence has the aromatic amino acid, Trp, in its first position, we envisaged that Trp-382 of GGA1 participates in a very similar interaction with the AP-1 γ-ear. In agreement with this model, we found that the analogous arginine residues in the AP-1 γ-ear, Arg-793 and Arg-795, when mutated to glutamine, rendered the GST γ-ear mutants incapable of interacting with myc-GGA1. Thus, the structural data, when taken together with this binding experiment, suggest that both Phe and Trp should be functional and interchangeable in the first position of the motif and that several bulky hydrophobic amino acids could occupy the fourth position of the motif. However, our mutagenesis analysis of the GGA1 382WNSF385 sequence and the surrounding residues revealed that this was not the case. We found that phenylalanine cannot substitute for tryptophan within the GGA1, NECAP1, or amphiphysin II WXX(W/F) motifs. We also observed that position +3 of the motif had to be occupied by either phenylalanine or tryptophan to maintain binding to the AP-1 γ-ear. Mutants of GGA1 with the bulky hydrophobic residues Val and Leu at the +3 position were unable to bind to the γ-ear. Furthermore, we found that the nature of the amino acids surrounding the core motif influenced binding to the GAE domain. For instance, when myc-GGA1 was truncated immediately following the 382WNSF385 sequence, binding to GST-γ-ear was abrogated, suggesting that the GGA1 WXXF motif cannot be located at the extreme C terminus of the protein. Similarly, truncation of the NECAP1 protein following the 252WGDF255 sequence abolished its ability to bind AP-1. In addition, we observed that binding of myc-GGA1-(Δ387–391) to GST-γ-ear was impaired and myc-GGA1-(376–380A) exhibited a partial decrease in binding. These findings show that the WXXF motif differs from the (D/E)FXXΦ GAE-binding motif in several respects. On the other hand, our peptide inhibition studies, together with the behavior of the GST-γ-ear mutants, suggest that the two motifs bind to a common site on the AP-1 γ-ear. One explanation consistent with all these findings is that the WXXF and the (D/E)FXXΦ motifs bind to the same site on the AP-1 γ-ear, but this binding is modulated by the residues neighboring the 0 and +3 positions of the motifs. For example, the FXXΦ motif is preceded in every case by an acidic residue that is not present in the WXXF motif (21Collins B.M. Praefcke G.J.K. Robinson M.S. Owen D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We are currently exploring this possibility using additional site-directed mutagenesis to change the residues surrounding the WXXF core motif. Another possibility is that the two motifs bind to overlapping sites on the AP-1 γ-ear. Very recently, a novel AP-2 α-appendage-binding motif conforming to the consensus WXX(F/W)X(D/E) was identified (26Ritter B. Philie J. Girard M. Tung E.C. Blondeau F. McPherson P.S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1-7Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Jha A. Agostinelli N.R. Mishra S.K. Keyel P.A. Hawryluk M.J. Traub L.M. J. Biol.

Although this AP-2-binding motif has a similar requirement to the AP-1-binding WXXF sequence for tryptophan and phenylalanine residues, a key difference is that the AP-2-interacting motif must be located at the extreme C terminus of the protein, as is the case with NECAP1 (26Ritter B.

This difference can explain the failure of GGA1 to bind to AP-2 and illustrates once again the important role that residues surrounding the core motif may play in modulating binding. We have previously demonstrated that GGAs 2 and 3, as well as GGA1, interact with the AP-1 γ-ear (15Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We found that the ability of GST-γ-ear to bind GGA2 and GGA3 was completely blocked in the presence of 1 mm of the GGA1 peptide (data not shown). Hence, we would predict the occurrence of analogous binding motifs (WXXF or FXXΦ) in the hinge regions of GGAs 2 and 3. An alignment of the three GGA hinge segments revealed no obvious candidate sequence in GGA2, but the 417WHLL420 sequence within the GGA3 hinge (long form) aligned with the 382WNSF385 sequence of GGA1 and could potentially be the γ-ear-binding motif. However, when we mutated both Trp-417 and Leu-420 to alanine, we observed no impairment in the binding of the GGA3 mutants to GST-γ-ear (data not shown). Thus, the GGA2 and GGA3 AP-1-binding motifs may represent other novel sequences that fit into the same hydrophobic pockets of the AP-1 γ-ear domain. While this manuscript was in preparation, Mattera et al. (28Mattera R. Ritter B. Sidhu S.S. McPherson P.S. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8018-8028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported that the NECAP1 GAE-binding motif resides in the sequence 252WGDF255, which is the same proximal WXXF motif that we have identified in the present study. In their study, the investigators performed a combinatorial analysis of GAE-binding motifs by phage display peptide library screening and found that the majority of the binding peptides had a tryptophan at position 0 and +3. Moreover, when they substituted a tryptophan for the phenylalanine in the Rabaptin5 FXXΦ GAE-interacting motif, they observed strong binding, suggesting that tryptophan may replace phenylalanine in FXXΦ-type motifs. Clearly, the reverse does not hold true, raising the possibility that the FXXΦ-type motif may have evolved from the WXX(F/W)-type motif with concomitant changes in the surrounding residues, thereby determining the predilection for either tryptophan or phenylalanine at position 0.

Bacterial cytochrome c peroxidases (CcP) are periplasmic enzymes found in bacteria, which carry out the 2-electron reduction of hydrogen peroxide (4Fülöp V. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 51: 163-204Google Scholar). The characterized examples of bacterial peroxidases are all diheme enzymes, making them distinct from the superfamily of plant and yeast peroxidases that contain a single heme unit (5Welinder K.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 215-220Google Scholar, 6Zamocky M. Janecek S. Koller F. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 169-182Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the bacterial diheme enzymes store electron equivalents differently than the monoheme-type CcPs; while the latter are known to generate Compound I in the course of catalysis (containing either a porphyrin radical or an oxidized Trp residue) (7Isaac I.S. Dawson J.H. Essays Biochem. 1999; 34: 51-69Google Scholar), the bacterial enzymes appear to use a ferrous secondary heme of high potential (H) to store the same electron equivalent needed to generate the radical-based Compound I in monoheme CcPs (8Greenwood C. Foote N. Gadsby P.M.A. Thomson A.J. Chem. Scr. 1988; 28A: 79-84Google Scholar). The bacterial CcP reaction cycle is depicted in Fig. 1, which shows that H formally cycles between the FeIII/II couple in the course of catalysis carried out at the low potential heme (L) active site (8Greenwood C. Foote N. Gadsby P.M.A. Thomson A.J. Chem. Scr. 1988; 28A: 79-84Google Scholar). Fig. 1 also shows that the isolated enzyme (HIIILIII) is unable to undergo efficient catalysis and first requires prereduction by 1 electron to generate a highly active state: HIILIII. The reduction potentials of H and L are well separated, allowing the HIILIII form to exist as a stable state (e.g. +320 mV and –330 mV for the enzyme from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9Ellfolk N. Rönnberg M. Aasa R. Andreasson L.-E. Vanngard T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 743: 23-30Google Scholar)). The scheme depicted in Fig. 1 requires a catalytic intermediate that is also HIIILIII formally, the same oxidation state as the inactive isolated form of the enzyme, which indicates that the activation/deactivation process likely involves more than a single electron transfer step. As the CcP from P. aeruginosa (4Fülöp V. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 51: 163-204Google Scholar), Paracoccus denitrificans (10Gilmour R. Goodhew C.F. Pettigrew G.W. Prazeres S. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 907-914Google Scholar), Rhodobacter capsulatus (11Hu W. De Smet L. Van Driessche G. Bartsch R.G. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 29-36Google Scholar), and Pseudomonas stutzeri (12Timoteo C.G. Tavares P. Goodhew C.F. Duarte L.C. Jumel K. Girio F.M.F. Harding S. Pettigrew G.W. Moura I. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 29-37Google Scholar) all require reductive activation, we believe that bacterial cytochrome c peroxidases pose an interesting problem regarding the interplay between redox chemistry and enzymatic activity.The CcP from Nitrosomonas europaea (NeCcP) also contains L and H hemes (–260 mV and +450 mV versus SHE) thought to act as the active site and an electronic conduit, respectively (13Arciero D.M. Hooper A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11878-11886Google Scholar). However, NeCcP is unlike most other bacterial CcP enzymes, as NeCcP is fully active in the all oxidized, isolated form (13Arciero D.M. Hooper A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11878-11886Google Scholar). This property is understood somewhat from consideration of the crystal structure of the enzyme, which possesses an open coordination site at LIII (14Shimizu H. Schuller D.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Sundaramoorthy M. Arciero D.M. Hooper A.B. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13483-13490Google Scholar). Conversely, the structure of the P. aeruginosa CcP (PaCcP) shows that the heme iron of L is coordinately saturated (15Fülöp V. Ridout C.J. Greenwood C. Hajdu J. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 1225-1233Google Scholar) in the fully oxidized and inactive state (Fig. 1). It has been proposed that reduction of H in PaCcP causes the loss of a ligand at L (15Fülöp V. Ridout C.J. Greenwood C. Hajdu J. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 1225-1233Google Scholar), based on EPR, Mössbauer, and optical studies (8Greenwood C. Foote N. Gadsby P.M.A. Thomson A.J. Chem. Scr. 1988; 28A: 79-84Google Scholar). The conformational change induced by ligand loss is likely part of the mechanism of activation. This also explains why the enzyme does not deactivate when it reaches the HIIILIII oxidation level as a part of the normal catalytic cycle; catalysis proceeds faster than the conformational reorientation associated with the inactive state. In comparison, the active site in the N. europaea enzyme appears ready to bind substrate in the HIIILIII state. Thus, Fig. 1 may not apply for NeCcP, and H need not exist as a long lived, reduced species in an intermediate state of the catalytic mechanism, as is required for other bacterial CcP enzymes.To investigate the link between redox chemistry and catalytic activity, we have initiated a study of the electrochemistry of the simpler of these enzymes, NeCcP, using the technique of PFV. PFV of redox active enzymes has proven to be a remarkably versatile and powerful tool to shed light upon the role of redox chemistry in enzyme mechanisms (1Armstrong F.A. Heering H.A. Hirst J. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1997; 26: 169-179Google Scholar, 2Elliott S.J. McElhaney A.E. Feng C.J. Enemark J.H. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11612-11613Google Scholar, 3Léger C. Elliott S.J. Hoke K.R. Jeuken L.J.C. Jones A.K. Armstrong F.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8653-8662Google Scholar). PFV can directly interrogate redox cofactors (e.g. hemes) and detect the catalytic chemistry of such cofactors when the experiment is carried out in the presence of substrate. In the case of bacterial CcP enzymes, questions regarding the inter-cofactor electron transfer and the requirement for prereduction of H may be probed electrochemically. In this report, we show catalytic PFV that reports upon the active site of NeCcP and further distinguishes NeCcP from other members of the cytochrome c peroxidase superfamily. The results are interpreted in terms of a redox-based rationale explaining why NeCcP does not require prior pre-reduction of H.MATERIALS AND METHODSEnzymology—Samples of N. europaea cytochrome c peroxidase were prepared as reported previously (13Arciero D.M. Hooper A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11878-11886Google Scholar). Aliquots of the 50 μm protein solution were stored at –80 °C between experiments.Electrochemistry—All electrochemical experiments were carried out in a water-jacketed electrochemical cell positioned with a Faraday cage. A rotating disc working electrode of pyrolytic graphite edge (PGE) was used for all experiments, along with a platinum wire counter electrode, and saturated Calomel (Accumet) reference electrode. Working electrode rotation rate was controlled by an EG&G electrode rotator. Staircase cyclic voltammetry was carried out using a PGSTAT 12 Autolab (Ecochemie, The Netherlands) fitted with an ECD module for enhanced sensitivity. All potentials are reported with respect to the hydrogen electrode, and were corrected +242 mV for SCE at 20 °C.Typical experiments utilized a mixed buffer system (5 mm each) of MES, HEPES, TAPS, and CHES, with 0.l M NaCl, and 200 μg/ml polymixin B sulfate. All reagents were from Sigma and of the highest quality possible. Buffer solutions were prepared with purified water (18 MΩ/cm). Solutions of the co-adsorbate polymixin B sulfate were prepared in advance as a 25 or mg/ml stocks solution and added separately for each experiment. Small aliquots of NeCcP (3 μl) were diluted into 2 ml of a prechilled cell containing buffer, salt, and co-adsorbate.For experiments, a PGE working electrode (0.03-cm2 geometric surface area) was polished with 1-μm alumina (Buehler) and cleaned of alumina with sonication and rinsing in water. Protein films were grown by cycling such a polished working electrode over a potential range of 0.74 to 0.04 mV, at a scan rate of 10 mV/s, for 20 min, while rotating the electrode at 200 rpm. The working electrode was then removed from the protein-containing solution, washed with water to remove excess protein, and then used in a clean cell with protein-free buffer. The temperature within the working cell was 0 °C.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have used PFV to observe redox chemistry of NeCcP as immobilized in protein films that retain the natural properties of the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 2, protein films of NeCcP at a PGE electrode and in the presence of hydrogen peroxide yield catalytic electrochemical signals, which are observed as reversible, sigmoidal “waves.” Such waves display a limiting current (ilim) that corresponds to an enzymatic velocity, and are centered at a potential (Ecat) that represents redox-linked chemistry within NeCcP. The observed electrochemical response is remarkably stable; multiple voltammetric cycles show minimal film loss and are highly reversible, indicating that protein denaturation does not occur in the course of measurements. We find that the magnitude of ilim scales with peroxide concentration and eventually saturates, in accord with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Also, ilim is invariant with rotation rate above 2000 rpm and shows little decay over time, indicating that diffusion and mechanical stability of the protein films do not influence the magnitude of the catalytic response. Taking ilim as an enzymatic velocity, a Michaelis-Menten treatment results in an Eadie-Hofstee plot (Fig. 2, inset B) that reveals values of Km and kcat, which are in general agreement with other values reported for other diheme peroxidases (12Timoteo C.G. Tavares P. Goodhew C.F. Duarte L.C. Jumel K. Girio F.M.F. Harding S. Pettigrew G.W. Moura I. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 29-37Google Scholar, 16Alves T. Besson S. Duarte L.C. Pettigrew G.W. Girio F.M.F. Devreese B. Vandenberghe I. Van Beeumen J. Fauque G. Moura I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 248-259Google Scholar); Km is found to be 55 μm for H2O2 and kcat is estimated to be over 1000 s–1. We note that for our data, determination of a value of kcat is achieved through an estimation of electroactive coverage, which is typically calculated through the peak area of non-turnover signals (1Armstrong F.A. Heering H.A. Hirst J. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1997; 26: 169-179Google Scholar, 2Elliott S.J. McElhaney A.E. Feng C.J. Enemark J.H. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11612-11613Google Scholar, 3Léger C. Elliott S.J. Hoke K.R. Jeuken L.J.C. Jones A.K. Armstrong F.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8653-8662Google Scholar). In the absence of peroxide, non-turnover signals are not typically observed, due to low electroactive coverage, and therefore we estimate an electroactive coverage of <0.5 pmol/cm2 (17Elliott S.J. Hoke K.R. Heffron K. Palak M. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Armstrong F.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 799-807Google Scholar) and estimate kcat using this as an upper limit. We note that our estimated value is in agreement with literature values for other CcP enzymes (10Gilmour R. Goodhew C.F. Pettigrew G.W. Prazeres S. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 907-914Google Scholar) and 300 times faster than the published value for NeCcP in an assay using horse heart cytochrome c as an electron donor for the less active, half-reduced enzyme (13Arciero D.M. Hooper A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11878-11886Google Scholar). Additionally, voltammograms of bulk-phase solutions of NeCcP (data not shown) show weak signals, which correspond to the previously reported potentials of the enzyme: +450 mV for HIII/II and –260 mV for LIII/II (13Arciero D.M. Hooper A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11878-11886Google Scholar). Together, these findings indicate that the NeCcP is not greatly perturbed by interacting with an electrode.Fig. 2Catalytic voltammetry of cytochrome c peroxidase from N. europaea in the presence of increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic midpoint potential, Ecat, is defined as the inflection point in the voltammogram. For each experimental trace, the limiting current (ilim) was taken as the current at 0.15 V. Other experimental parameters were: pH = 7.0, v = 20 mV/s, T = 0 °C, electrode rotation rate = 2000 rpm. Inset A, a plot indicating the correlation between Ecat and the substrate concentration. Ecat varies with [H2O2] with a slope of –62 mV per [H2O2] decade. Inset B, an Eadie-Hofstee plot of the catalytic response, taking the limiting current (–ilim) observed at 0.15 V as an enzymatic velocity; the negative slope of the plot equals Km.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The data shown in Fig. 2 contrast sharply with previous PFV studies of peroxidases and immediately distinguishes NeCcP from other peroxidases studied by electrochemistry; Armstrong and co-workers have shown the monoheme yeast CcP (yCcP) yields a single sharp non-turnover signal due to the reversible 2-electron generation of Compound I, at +750 mV (18Mondal M.S. Fuller H.A. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 263-264Google Scholar, 19Mondal M.S. Goodin D.B. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6270-6276Google Scholar). Complementing catalytic signals were also observed at the same potential and reveal cooperative electron transfer (18Mondal M.S. Fuller H.A. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 263-264Google Scholar, 19Mondal M.S. Goodin D.B. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6270-6276Google Scholar). Furthermore, the bacterial P. denitrificans CcP (PdCcP) has been shown to give irreversible, non-turnover electrochemical signals in bulk phase cyclic voltammetry (20Lopes H. Pettigrew G.W. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 632-642Google Scholar). The irreversibility of both the H and L signals was taken to indicate the redox-linked activation process required for the L active site as shown in Fig. 1; no catalytic activity was observed for PdCcP (20Lopes H. Pettigrew G.W. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 632-642Google Scholar). In contrast to both of these cases, NeCcP films give reversible catalytic waveshapes (Fig. 2) centered at a midpoint potential (Ecat) significantly less than what has been observed in analogous voltammetry of yeast CcP Compound I. The sigmoidal waveshapes seen in Fig. 2 have a value of Ecat of +515 mV or greater (see inset A), depending upon the substrate concentration, making it distinct from both (a) the resting HIII/II potential (+450 mV) and (b) the potential reported 2-electron generation of Compound I (+750 mV) (18Mondal M.S. Fuller H.A. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 263-264Google Scholar).In the assignment of the catalytic wave to a specific redox process, we note that there are two principle possibilities: Ecat may represent a rate-limiting electron transfer from the H center (as suggested for the Pseudomonas-type CcP, as shown in Fig. 1) or Ecat may involve an intrinsic electron transfer-linked step of the catalytic site. Regarding the former possibility, the waveshape of the NeCcP catalytic response can be modeled in terms of an n = 1 process, and there is no evidence of cooperativity, unlike the yCcP findings of Armstrong and co-workers (18Mondal M.S. Fuller H.A. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 263-264Google Scholar). Furthermore, the observed value of Ecat is close to the HIII/II couple and suggests that the observed catalytic voltammetry may be due to intramolecular electron transfer from H to the L active site as would be required for the mechanism shown in Fig. 1. Such a proposal would render the observed kcat a rate-limiting electron transfer constant, and Ecat would be due to the HIII/II couple. Yet, for NeCcP there is no indication of the electrochemical irreversibly observed for the Paracoccus enzyme which requires reduction of H to become active (20Lopes H. Pettigrew G.W. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 632-642Google Scholar), and Ecat is greater than the value of the HIII/II potential. Regarding the issue of irreversibility and electrochemical activation, the catalytic waves we observe have highly reversible shape with respect to both the scan rate and the starting potential of the scan. Both observations indicate that Ecat corresponds to a fast electrochemical event that would reveal the activation step required by other peroxidases.Several additional pieces of evidence argue in favor of the assignment of Ecat to an active-site redox process and against the possibility that Ecat represents the electron transfer from H. First, Ecat is dependent upon [H2O2] with a gradient of –62 mV per [H2O2] decade as shown in Fig. 2 (inset A). This indicates that Ecat is associated with a catalytic feature dependent upon peroxide binding, a property that should be associated with the active site. Second, the pH dependence of Ecat displays a complex relationship between Ecat and pH. As shown in Fig. 3, Ecat obeys a linear dependence at the extrema of pH, with a gradient of 64 mV/decade, yet appears to be approximately pH-independent at intermediate values. The observation of this complex pH dependence also reinforces our suggestion that Ecat corresponds to a process occurring at the active site, as heme groups involved in simple electron transfer reactions rarely demonstrate a pH dependence. For example, the heme groups of the multiheme enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase have been found to possess reduction potentials that are independent from pH, except for the P460 active site, which displays a pH dependence of –60 mV/decade (21Collins M.J. Arciero D.M. Hooper A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14655-14662Google Scholar).Fig. 3pH dependence of Ecat determined for voltammograms of NeCcP, in the presence of 100 μm substrate. The data are fit to the Equation 1 described in the text and which represent a binding scheme of 2 protons to an n = 1 process, as depicted in the inset.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The data from Fig. 3 are readily fit to a two pKa model in which both the oxidized state and the reduced state can be protonated independently (Fig. 3) as described by Equation 1 (22Clark H.W. Oxidation and Reduction Potentials of Organic Systems. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore1960Google Scholar, 23Breton J.L. Duff J.L.C. Butt J.N. Armstrong F.A. George S.J. Pétillot Y. Forest E.

E=E'+2.303RTnFlog[H+]2+[H+]Kred[H+]+Kox(Eq. 1) This model yields pKa values of 6.5 ± 0.5 and 8.4 ± 0.2 for the reduced and oxidized species, respectively. The observation of the two pKa values is invariant with respect to H2O2 concentration used in the experiment. We take the pH dependence as further evidence that Ecat represents an active site species and that Ecat does not represent a mediating electron transfer process from the electrode. We note the observed pKa values are similar to those observed in a monoheme CcP (24Battistuzzi G. D'Onofrio M. Loschi L. Sola M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 100-112Google Scholar), as well as those found for an active site histidine and bound Fe(III) aquo in studies of myoglobin (25Redaelli C. Monzani E. Santagostini L. Casella L. Sanangelantoni A.M. Pierattelli R. Banci L. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 226-233Google Scholar). However, the source of the pKa values are not clear currently, while the superfamily of peroxidases typically contains a conserved Arg and His motif at the peroxide binding site; NeCcP contains an Gln and Glu residue (14Shimizu H. Schuller D.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Sundaramoorthy M. Arciero D.M. Hooper A.B. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13483-13490Google Scholar). Thus, further experiments will be needed to determine the identity of the specific proton donors to the NeCcP active site.The catalytic voltammetry observed above indicates a redox-active process at the NeCcP active site, which requires the binding of both protons and substrate. Given this, and the observation that NeCcP is fully active in the isolated form (12Timoteo C.G. Tavares P. Goodhew C.F. Duarte L.C. Jumel K. Girio F.M.F. Harding S. Pettigrew G.W. Moura I. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 29-37Google Scholar), we propose that the chemical identity of Ecat is best understood in terms of a redox cycle of the enzyme shown in Fig. 4. This scheme suggests a mechanism that is much more like that of the monoheme CcP enzymes; substrate binds at L in an active HIIILIII state, and the 2-electron reduction of hydrogen peroxide generates Compound I through the oxidation of the L iron to the [FeIV=O] species and another residue, R, which results in a stable radical. (The nature of the R group shown in Fig. 4 is not clear currently and may be a porphyrin-based radical or another redox active group in analogy to the yCcP.) Compound II is subsequently generated and reduced in two independent n = 1-electron transfer steps. Here Compound II is formally a [FeIV=O] species and not the diferric form of the enzyme invoked in the mechanisms of other bacterial CcP enzymes, as shown in Fig. 1. Thus, for NeCcP H does not play the role observed for most other CcP (e.g. the Pseudomonas and Paracoccus) enzymes, where it effectively stores an electron for the catalytic chemistry occurring at L. Based on this premise, the highly reversible nature of the n = 1 voltammetric signals, the value of Ecat, the pH dependence of Ecat, and the lack of cooperativity observed in the catalytic waveshape all indicate that the electrochemical signal observed here represents the reduction of Compound II as depicted in Fig. 4, a formally proton-coupled electron transfer step.Fig. 4A modified mechanism for NeCcP reduction of hydrogen peroxide. Unlike Fig. 1, the reduction of H is not required for catalysis, and the 2-electron oxidation of the active site generates Compound I, without the oxidation of H. The nature of the group R that participates in Compound I formation is not known currently.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Thus, NeCcP electrochemical catalysis appears to be controlled by two 1-electron events, in contrast to yCcP, which shows evidence of cooperativity. Furthermore NeCcP does not display any evidence of redox-linked activation that is required in other bacterial cytochrome c peroxidases. Our findings show that this can be understood in terms of the stepwise reduction of Compound I and Compound II that are a part of an enzymatic cycle in which the HIIILIII state is fully active (Fig. 4). We have also demonstrated that PFV will be a valuable tool for the study of the NeCcP mechanism; future experiments will focus upon the contribution of proton coupling in the chemistry of Compound II reduction.

Bacterial cytochrome c peroxidases (CcP) are periplasmic enzymes found in bacteria, which carry out the 2-electron reduction of hydrogen peroxide (4Fülöp V. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 51: 163-204Google Scholar). The characterized examples of bacterial peroxidases are all diheme enzymes, making them distinct from the superfamily of plant and yeast peroxidases that contain a single heme unit (5Welinder K.G.

It has been proposed that the bacterial diheme enzymes store electron equivalents differently than the monoheme-type CcPs; while the latter are known to generate Compound I in the course of catalysis (containing either a porphyrin radical or an oxidized Trp residue) (7Isaac I.S. Dawson J.H. Essays Biochem. 1999; 34: 51-69Google Scholar), the bacterial enzymes appear to use a ferrous secondary heme of high potential (H) to store the same electron equivalent needed to generate the radical-based Compound I in monoheme CcPs (8Greenwood C. Foote N. Gadsby P.M.A. Thomson A.J. Chem. Scr. 1988; 28A: 79-84Google Scholar). The bacterial CcP reaction cycle is depicted in Fig. 1, which shows that H formally cycles between the FeIII/II couple in the course of catalysis carried out at the low potential heme (L) active site (8Greenwood C.

Science. 1998; 240: 889-985Google Scholar). NHRs act via recruiting coactivators. In mammals, the coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) binds the p160 family of steroid receptor coactivators to enhance transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors (2Stallcup M.R.

CARM1 can methylate histone H3, and a mutation in the S-adenosylmethionine binding domain of CARM1 substantially reduces both methyltransferase and coactivator activities (4Chen D. Ma H. Hong H.

Riddiford L.M. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2002; 47: 467-500Google Scholar). Ecdysone also regulates programmed cell death (PCD) during metamorphosis (7Jiang C. Baehrecke E.H. Thummel C.S.

An ecdysone pulse toward the end of the larval stage signals puparium formation. A second pulse ∼12 h later initiates head eversion. During the course of metamorphosis, obsolete larval tissues, such as salivary glands and midgut, are deleted, and progenitor cells give rise to adult tissues (7Jiang C. Baehrecke E.H. Thummel C.S.

Cell death in larval midgut begins at puparium formation in response to the late larval pulse of ecdysone, whereas the salivary glands undergo removal around 15 h later in response to a second pulse of ecdysone (8Baehrecke E.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1057-1062Google Scholar). Ecdysone bound by its receptor transcriptionally regulates a number of primary response genes encoding transcription factor. These transcription factors in turn regulate several secondary response genes such as those encoding the proapoptotic proteins RPR and HID, the adaptor DARK, and the caspase DRONC (8Baehrecke E.H.

How this single steroid hormone controls many diverse biological processes in a temporally and spatially specific manner is poorly understood, but it is possible that coactivators and corepressors mediate this process. So far, there has been no direct evidence supporting the role of histone methyltransferases in nuclear hormone-mediated PCD in either the mammalian or Drosophila system. In this paper we demonstrate that a CARM1 homologue in Drosophila plays an essential role in coordinating ecdysone-induced gene expression and PCD.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCARMER Expression Constructs and GST Fusion Proteins—The carmer cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR using Drosophila embryo mRNA. A methyltransferase-deficient CARMER mutant was generated by replacing the conserved Val-Leu-Asp motif (Fig. 1A) with Ala residues. The open reading frames of wild-type and mutant carmer were amplified with BamHI/EcoRI sites in the primers and cloned into the insect expression vector pIE1-4 (Novagen) and the GST fusion vector pGEX2TK (Amersham Biosciences). For the production of GST fusion proteins, the pGEX2TK construct was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 Star and GST fusion proteins purified by affinity chromatography.In Vitro Methylation Assays—Methylation assays were performed by incubating 3 μg of calf thymus histones (Roche Applied Science) with either 1 μg of purified GST, GST-CARMER, or GST-CARMER mutant in the presence of 7 μm S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine in 30 μl of HMT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EDTA) for 90 min (13Teyssier C. Chen D. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46066-46072Google Scholar). A portion of the mouse voltage-gated sodium channel 1 fused to GST (GST-Nav1.1) (provided by A. Fotia) was used as an unrelated protein control in methylation studies. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS loading buffer and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Samples were electrophoresed in duplicate. One gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to localize the positions of various histones, and the other was autoradiographed. Gels were fixed, soaked in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min, dried, and exposed to Kodak film overnight at -70 °C. The autoradiograph was overlaid with the Coomassie-stained gel to identify the methylated histone species.Cells and Caspase Assays—l(2)mbn cells (kind gift from Dr A. Dorn) (14Ress C. Holtmann M. Maas U. Sofsky J. Dorn A. Tissue & Cell. 2000; 32: 464-477Google Scholar) were grown in Schneider's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells, 1.5 × 106/well, were seeded in 6-well plates in triplicate. Where necessary, ecdysone (10 μm) (Sigma) was added for the desired times. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Cell lysates were prepared by freeze/thawing and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. 50 μg of lysate was assayed for caspase activity using Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumaride (DEVD-amino-4-methylcoumaride) (Enzyme System Products, CA) substrate as described previously (15Dorstyn L. Colussi P.A. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4307-4312Google Scholar, 16Dorstyn L. Read S. Cakouros D. Huh J.R. Hay B.A. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1089-1098Google Scholar).RNA Extraction from Cells and Flies and Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells, dissected tissues, and whole animals using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) essentially as described (12Cakouros D. Daish T. Martin D. Baehrecke E.H. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 985-995Google Scholar, 17Daish T.J. Cakouros D. Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1348-1356Google Scholar). Up to 2 μg of total RNA was used as template for cDNA synthesis in a 15-μl reaction with 200 ng of oligo(dT)18 primer using a First Strand Synthesis Kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. By using 2 μl of cDNA template, PCR amplification was performed using appropriate primers in a 50-μl reaction employing 27 cycles. Drosophila rp49 was used as a control. 5 μl of PCR was electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel for analysis. Where indicated, band intensities were determined using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoprecipitation—3 × 107 l(2)mbn cells were transfected with either pIE1-4 vector alone, pIE1-4 vector containing the FLAG-tagged Broad Complex Z2 isoform (BRC-Z2-FLAG), or pIE carmer-FLAG. BRC-Z2 is an ecdysone-induced transcription factor with a size similar to CARMER (12Cakouros D. Daish T. Martin D. Baehrecke E.H. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 985-995Google Scholar). BRC-Z2 does not bind EcR/Usp. After 48 h, cells were treated with 10 μm ecdysone for 6 h where indicated and harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and complete protease inhibitor mixture). Cell lysates were prepared by freeze/thawing and clarified by centrifugation. 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) was added to the lysates and allowed to rotate on a wheel overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer with 2% Tween 20 and analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-FLAG (Sigma) or anti-EcRB1 antibody (AD4.4, from the Hybridoma Bank). Bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences).Transient Transfections and Apoptosis Assays—2 × 106 l(2)mbn cells were transfected in triplicate with 1 μgof hsp EcR-luciferase vector and either 800 ng pIE1-4 vector or 400–800 ng of pIE-carmer or pIE-carmer mutant expression vector. Where needed, pIE1-4 was added to make up the DNA to 800 ng. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h and then treated with 10 μm ecdysone for 12 h. Cells were lysed in 100 mm phosphate buffer by freeze-thawing. Equal amounts of protein lysate were used in luciferase assays as described previously (12Cakouros D. Daish T. Martin D. Baehrecke E.H. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 985-995Google Scholar). For cell death experiments, 2 × 105 l(2)mbn cells were cotransfected with either 2 μg of pIE1-4 vector, pIE-carmer, or pIE-carmer mutant together with 500 ng of pIE-LacZ. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h and then treated with 10 μm ecdysone for 24 and 48 h. Cell survival/apoptosis was scored as described previously (12Cakouros D. Daish T. Martin D. Baehrecke E.H. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 985-995Google Scholar, 18Colussi P.A. Quinn L.M. Huang D.C.S. Coombe M. Read S.H. Richardson H. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 703-710Google Scholar).RNA Interference (RNAi)—A region of carmer open reading frame (nucleotides 1074–1559) was PCR-amplified and cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). dsRNA was prepared, and RNAi experiments were carried out essentially as described (12Cakouros D. Daish T. Martin D. Baehrecke E.H. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 985-995Google Scholar, 16Dorstyn L. Read S. Cakouros D. Huh J.R. Hay B.A. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1089-1098Google Scholar). For a negative control mouse N4WBP5A cDNA (∼700 bp coding region) (19Harvey K.F Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A. Parton R.G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9307-9317Google Scholar) cloned into pGEM-T Easy was used (16Dorstyn L. Read S. Cakouros D. Huh J.R. Hay B.A. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1089-1098Google Scholar). Plasmids were linearized and RNA synthesized using T7 and SP6 Megascript kits (Ambion). Sense and antisense strands were annealed to generate dsRNA, and the quality of RNA was analyzed on agarose gel. dsRNA (10–100 nm) was added to cells in serum-free media and mixed vigorously. Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was added following a 1-h incubation. Cells were incubated overnight and then, where indicated, treated with ecdysone.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA CARM1 Homologue in Drosophila—The role of coactivators in mediating EcR-induced transcription in Drosophila is not well understood. To understand how ecdysone temporally and spatially regulates gene expression, it is pivotal to identify cofactors that are recruited by the EcR. Given the remarkable conservation in nuclear hormone receptors and apoptotic machinery between invertebrates and mammals, we set out to identify the arginine-histone methyltransferase CARM1 homologue in Drosophila and study its role in PCD. Blast analysis of the Drosophila database using murine CARM1 retrieved a protein (CG5358) with 65% homology to CARM1 and 62% homology to human PRMT4 (Fig. 1A). Although there are a number of other potential protein-arginine methyltransferases in the fly genome (results not shown), CG5358 shares the highest degree of identity with CARM1/PRMT4. Given the role of this protein in EcR/Usp-mediated gene expression, we have named it CARMER (coactivator Arg methyltransferase for EcR/Usp). CARMER is a 530-residue protein containing a conserved central region that harbors the putative binding site for the p160 coactivators and the adomethyl-binding pocket. To assess the catalytic function of CARMER, we performed in vitro histone methylation assays by using either GST-fused purified recombinant CARMER protein or a mutant version where conserved amino acids have been changed. As shown in Fig. 1B, GST-CARMER efficiently methylated histone H3. In longer exposures, some methylation of histone H4 was also seen (data not shown). Mutation of the conserved catalytic residues abolished the ability of CARMER to methylate histones. Histone specificity was demonstrated as a non-related substrate was not methylated. These data indicate that CARMER is an authentic homologue of CARM1.CARMER Binds EcR and Augments Ecdysone-mediated Transcription—To test the ability of CARMER to bind EcR/Usp, FLAG-tagged CARMER was transfected into Drosophila l(2)mbn cells that express functional EcR/Usp and treated with ecdysone. FLAG immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and blotted with an EcR-B1 isoform-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, CARMER clearly coimmunoprecipitated with EcR-B1, whereas the ecdysone-inducible transcription factor, BRC-Z2, showed no significant association with EcR-B1 over the vector control background. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. We then analyzed whether CARMER could transactivate expression of an EcR/Usp-driven reporter. We transfected l(2)mbn cells with a luciferase reporter driven by the Drosophila Hsp promoter containing EcR/Usp-binding elements with increasing amounts of CARMER or mutant CARMER. In the presence of ecdysone the reporter was significantly activated (Fig. 2B). Transfection of 400–800 ng of carmer expression vector enhanced both the basal level and ecdysone-induced reporter activity. However, increasing the levels of CARMER did not enhance transcription. Cotransfection of the methylase-deficient mutant CARMER showed reduction, rather than an absence, of enhancement of the reporter activity (Fig. 2B). This suggests that in addition to the methylase activity of CARMER, other functions of the protein may contribute to transcriptional activation. This is supported by the fact that mammalian CARM1 can recruit additional cofactors and stimulate their activities (13Teyssier C. Chen D. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46066-46072Google Scholar, 20Xu W. Cho H. Kadam S. Banayo E.M. Anderson S. Yates III, J.R. Emerson B.M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 144-156Google Scholar).Fig. 2CARMER interacts with the ecdysone receptor and potentiates transcription and ecdysone-mediated PCD. A, l(2)mbn cells were transfected with either pIE1-4 vector alone (vector), pIE-BRC-Z2-FLAG (BRC-Z2), or pIE-carmer-FLAG (carmer) and either not treated (-) or treated with 10 μm ecdysone (Ecd)(+) for 6 h. Lysates were immunoblotted (WB) with EcR-B1 antibody or anti-FLAG antibody. Where indicated, immunoprecipitations (IP) were carried out using anti-FLAG antibody prior to Western blot with murine EcR-B1 antibody. EcR-B1, the FLAG-tagged CARMER, and BRC-Z2 proteins are indicated. B, l(2)mbn cells were transfected in triplicate with 1 μg of hsp EcR-luciferase vector and either 800 ng of pIE empty vector, 400 or 800 ng of pIE-carmer (carmer), or pIE-carmer mutant (mutant carmer) expression vector. Where necessary, the amount of DNA was equalized with pIE vector. Cells were treated with ecdysone (+) or left untreated (-), as indicated. Lysates were assayed for luciferase activity which is represented as CPM. C, l(2)mbn cells were transfected in triplicate with either 2 μg of pIE1-4 empty vector (vector), pIE-carmer (carmer), or pIE-carmer mutant (Mutant carmer) together with 500 ng of pIE-LacZ. Cells were treated with ecdysone for the indicated time. The β-galactosidase-positive cells were counted as live transfected cells, and the untreated cells for each transfectant were graphed as 100%.

The Drosophila larval cell line, l(2)mbn, underwent apoptosis in response to ecdysone treatment (12Cakouros D. Daish T. Martin D. Baehrecke E.H. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 985-995Google Scholar, 14Ress C. Holtmann M. Maas U. Sofsky J. Dorn A. Tissue & Cell. 2000; 32: 464-477Google Scholar) thus making these cells ideal to assess the role of CARMER in ecdysone-mediated PCD. l(2)mbn cells were transfected with either CARMER or CARMER mutant and treated with ecdysone. As shown in Fig. 2C, ectopic expression of CARMER significantly enhanced ecdysone-mediated cell death, whereas the mutation in the adomethyl-binding pocket of CARMER eliminated this ability. The effects seen in Fig. 2, B and C, suggest that other cofactors (such as p160) may be limiting in these experiments.CARMER Is Required for Ecdysone-mediated Cell Death—To test the in vivo role of CARMER in ecdysone-induced cell death, we used RNAi to knock down expression of carmer. Whereas addition of ecdysone to l(2)mbn cells or cells transfected with a control dsRNA resulted in apoptosis, knockdown of carmer resulted in a near complete inhibition of cell death (Fig. 3A). Although CARMER was required for hormone-mediated cell death, carmer RNAi had no effect on cycloheximide-induced apoptosis of l(2)mbn cells (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate for the first time that ecdysone-mediated apoptosis is dependent on CARMER. We have shown previously that ecdysone-mediated apoptosis is caspase-dependent (12Cakouros D. Daish T. Martin D. Baehrecke E.H. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 985-995Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the inhibition of ecdysone-induced cell death in l(2)mbn cells resulting from the knockdown of carmer was due to a decrease in caspase activity. As shown in Fig. 3C, untreated cells had low caspase activity, which was elevated following ecdysone addition. Although the treatment of cells with a control dsRNA showed no significant difference in caspase activation, knockdown of carmer resulted in a near complete inhibition of caspase activation (Fig. 3C).Fig. 3Knockdown of carmer inhibits ecdysone-mediated PCD and caspase activation. A, l(2)mbn cells were treated in triplicate with dsRNA to carmer, murine N4WBP5A (control), or without dsRNA (none). Cells were either left untreated (-) or treated (+) with ecdysone (Ecd) for 24 h where indicated. Cell survival was scored, and untreated cells were graphed as 100%. Error bars represent S.D. B, cells were treated as in A except cycloheximide (CHX) was used as the apoptotic agent.

Given the marked inhibition of caspase activity in these experiments, we examined the effect of knocking down carmer on the expression of apoptotic genes. carmer transcript was evident in untreated l(2)mbn cells, and ecdysone treatment had no effect on its levels (Fig. 4), suggesting that CARMER itself is not regulated by ecdysone. Whereas the treatment of cells with a control dsRNA had no effect, dsRNA directed to carmer effectively eliminated most of the carmer transcript (Fig. 4). Among the seven caspases in Drosophila, DRONC is the key initiator caspase, whereas DRICE and DCP-1 are important downstream caspases (16Dorstyn L. Read S. Cakouros D. Huh J.R. Hay B.A. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1089-1098Google Scholar, 21Kumar S. Doumanis J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1039-1044Google Scholar). Expression analysis showed that the low basal levels of all three caspase transcripts were up-regulated ∼5–6-fold in response to ecdysone treatment for 24 h as assessed by band intensities (Fig. 4). The knockdown of carmer reduced the expression levels of all three caspases in response to ecdysone. Whereas ecdysone-induced drice and dcp-1 up-regulation was almost completely abolished, dronc expression was reduced to ∼2-fold (from ∼5-fold) in the absence of carmer. DARK, an Apaf-1-like adaptor protein required for DRONC activation, is also known to be up-regulated by ecdysone (8Baehrecke E.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1057-1062Google Scholar, 11Lee C.-Y. Wendel D.P. Reid P. Lam G. Thummel C.S. Baehrecke E.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 433-443Google Scholar). In l(2)mbn cells, a 24-h ecdysone treatment resulted in ∼3.5-fold induction of dark transcript, which was abolished upon the knockdown of carmer (Fig. 4). The upstream proapoptotic proteins RPR and HID have been shown to be up-regulated by ecdysone during salivary gland and midgut cell death (8Baehrecke E.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1057-1062Google Scholar, 11Lee C.-Y. Wendel D.P. Reid P. Lam G. Thummel C.S. Baehrecke E.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 433-443Google Scholar). rpr and hid transcripts were also up-regulated 2–3-fold by ecdysone in l(2)mbn cells, and knockdown of carmer almost entirely abolished the levels of ecdysone-mediated up-regulation of these genes (Fig. 4). grim transcript, however, was not significantly induced by ecdysone, and knockdown of carmer had no effect on its expression levels. These data suggest that CARMER coordinates the EcR/Usp-mediated regulation of several core cell death molecules.Fig. 4Knockdown of carmer inhibits ecdysone-mediated transcription of apoptotic genes. l(2)mbn cells were left untreated (none) or incubated with dsRNA to carmer or murine N4WBP5A (control). Cells were either left untreated (-) or treated (+) with ecdysone (Ecd) for 24 h where indicated. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by RT-PCR using gene-specific primers. rp49 was used as a RNA/cDNA control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)CARMER Expression during Drosophila Development—RT-PCR analysis of carmer expression throughout fly development showed that carmer transcript is abundant in early embryos; however, its expression is dramatically reduced in late embryonic and larval stages before being up-regulated at the early prepupal stage. This is followed by down-regulation of the transcript until the adult stage where it is again up-regulated (Fig. 5A). Most interesting, the up-regulation of carmer at the early prepupal stage correlates with the histolysis of larval tissues during metamorphosis. This was analyzed more closely in both salivary glands and midguts at specific stages, which showed that in salivary glands carmer levels were up-regulated at a time when this tissue undergoes histolysis (Fig. 5B). carmer transcript was also present in midgut but was not up-regulated (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that CARMER may be required for ecdysone-mediated deletion of these tissues.Fig. 5carmer is expressed throughout Drosophila development. RNA was isolated from Drosophila at different stages of development and analyzed by RT-PCR. A, embryonic stages 0–8 and 8–16 represent hours after egg laying (h AEL). Early pupae (E) correspond to the time of salivary gland histolysis. carmer as well as rp49 control transcripts are shown. B, salivary glands and midguts were dissected from staged larvae. 128–132 h after egg laying represents early pupal stages where the salivary gland is undergoing histolysis (132 h), and 120 h corresponds to the initiation of midgut histolysis.

Although a carmer fly mutant is currently unavailable, we would predict such a mutation to be lethal. With the use of RNAi we have established an essential role for CARMER in ecdysone-mediated apoptosis of a well characterized ecdysone-responsive cell line l(2)mbn (12Cakouros D. Daish T. Martin D. Baehrecke E.H. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 985-995Google Scholar, 14Ress C. Holtmann M. Maas U. Sofsky J. Dorn A. Tissue & Cell. 2000; 32: 464-477Google Scholar). The expression of all known ecdysone-responsive cell death genes tested was affected by CARMER ablation suggesting that CARMER coordinates ecdysone-mediated gene transcription. Given that CARMER associates with EcR (probably indirectly through p160 coactivators), we speculate that gene expression by CARMER may be mediated by its direct recruitment to the EcR/Usp sites on target gene promoters as well as on the promoters of ecdysone-induced transcription factors (e.g. BR-C and E93) that are known to regulate many apoptotic genes (8Baehrecke E.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1057-1062Google Scholar, 9Kumar S. Cakouros D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Given its dynamic expression throughout Drosophila development, as well as its up-regulation in the salivary gland at the time corresponding to PCD, it would be interesting to determine whether CARMER is important for all ecdysone-mediated events of metamorphosis or just specific biological events.

In mammals, the coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) binds the p160 family of steroid receptor coactivators to enhance transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors (2Stallcup M.R.

The mammalian cell nucleus is organized into distinct nuclear domains or compartments that are essential for diverse physiological processes. Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear body or nuclear domain 10 is one of the nuclear domains and is involved in tumor suppression and regulation of transcription. Here, we investigate the role of PML nuclear body in MEF transactivation. We show that PML, but not Sp100, induced the accumulation of MEF in PML nuclear bodies and that MEF and PML physically interacted. This interaction stimulated MEF transcriptional activity, resulting in the up-regulation of endogenous lysozyme expression. Amino acids 348-517 of MEF were required for the accumulation of MEF in PML nuclear bodies and up-regulation of lysozyme transcription, which is enhanced by PML. Moreover, the C-terminal region of MEF spanning amino acids 477-517 was the putative region required for interaction between MEF and PML as determined with the use of the mammalian two-hybrid system. In addition, heat-shock treatment induced the accumulation of MEF in endogenous PML nuclear bodies and enhanced MEF transactivation of lysozyme gene. Thus, the recruitment of MEF to PML nuclear bodies may partly regulate lysozyme transcription in epithelial cells.

The mammalian cell nucleus contains a large number of specialized nuclear domains or compartments. Each nuclear domain has been reported to relate with various physiological processes, such as transcription, DNA replication and pre-mRNA splicing (1Spector D.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2891-2893Google Scholar).

PML NBs have been reported to vary in size from 0.2 to 1.0 μm in diameter, and a typical mammalian nucleus contains 10-30 of these nuclear bodies (2Lamond A.I. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1998; 280: 547-553Google Scholar, 4Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-90Google Scholar). Two major components, PML and Sp100, are considered to build the framework of PML nuclear bodies (5Muller S. Dejean A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5137-5143Google Scholar). PML was identified as part of a fusion protein with retinoic acid receptor α, resulting from the t(15;17) chromosomal translocation expressed in acute promyelocytic leukemia (6Kakizuka A.

Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 179-184Google Scholar). Sp100 was first characterized as an autoantigen in certain autoimmune disorders (8Szostecki C. Guldner H.H. Netter H.J. Will H. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4338-4347Google Scholar). Although PML and Sp100 are core components of PML nuclear bodies, numerous proteins, such as p53, SUMO-1, CBP, HDAC, Daxx, pRB, and HIPK2, seem to transiently localize to PML nuclear bodies (4Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-90Google Scholar, 9Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2002; 108: 165-170Google Scholar, 10Pearson M. Carbone R. Sebastiani C. Cioce M. Fagioli M.

A variety of functions has been suggested for PML nuclear bodies, including tumor suppression and transcriptional regulation through the titration, modification, and compartmentalization of proteins (4Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-90Google Scholar, 9Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2002; 108: 165-170Google Scholar). The ETS transcription factor family has more than 30 members, and a number of these factors have been shown to play roles in important physiological processes, including cellular proliferation, differentiation, development, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, and transformation (13Sharrocks A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Google Scholar). ETS proteins have conserved DNA binding domain, which is the ETS domain. This ETS domain binds to specific DNA sequence with a variant core motif GGA, which is known as the ETS binding site (13Sharrocks A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Google Scholar, 14Sementchenko V.I. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6533-6548Google Scholar). It has been shown that protein-protein interaction and post-translational modification regulate DNA binding, subcellular localization, and transcriptional activity of ETS proteins (15Li R. Pei H.

However, regulation of ETS proteins through nuclear domains has not been studied extensively. Myeloid elf-1-like factor (MEF) or Elf4, is an ETS protein composed of 663 amino acids. It is widely distributed in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tissues. It was initially found to activate the promoters of hematopoietic growth factor genes, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and interleukin-3 (21Miyazaki Y. Sun X. Uchida H. Zhang J. Nimer S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1721-1729Google Scholar). MEF physically and functionally interacts with AML1, a transcription factor that is essential for the development of definitive hematopoiesis, and the activity of MEF is repressed by the AML1-ETO fusion protein, which is specifically found in acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21) chromosomal translocation (22Mao S. Frank R.C. Zhang J. Miyazaki Y. Nimer S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3635-3644Google Scholar). Recently, it was also found that MEF is essential for the proper function of natural killer cells as determined from knock-out mice (23Lacorazza H.D. Miyazaki Y. Di Cristofano A. Deblasio A. Hedvat C. Zhang J. Cordon-Cardo C. Mao S. Pandolfi P.P. Nimer S.D. Immunity. 2002; 17: 437-449Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that MEF up-regulates lysozyme gene expression in epithelial cells (24Kai H. Hisatsune A. Chihara T. Uto A. Kokusho A. Miyata T. Basbaum C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20098-20102Google Scholar). We also found that MEF is constitutively localized in the nucleus under normal or stress conditions (25Suico M.A. Koyanagi T. Ise S. Lu Z. Hisatsune A. Seki Y. Shuto T. Isohama Y. Miyata T. Kai H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 113-120Google Scholar). We attempt to investigate the subnuclear localization of MEF and how this regulates MEF transactivation. We report here that MEF is recruited to the PML NBs and physically interacts with PML to enhance MEF transactivation potential. Our finding shows that this interaction up-regulates MEF-mediated transcription of lysozyme gene. Plasmids—The luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2-lysozyme-luc and the expression plasmids pCB6-MEF; pEGFP-MEF full-length; pEGFPMEF deletion mutants coding for GFP-MEF 1-517 and GFP-MEF 1-347 amino acids; and pM-MEF deletion mutants coding for GAL4-MEF 306-663, GAL4-MEF 292-476, and GAL4-MEF 477-663 amino acids were cloned as described previously (24Kai H.

Miyata T. Kai H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 113-120Google Scholar). pcDNA3-Flag-PML was also cloned previously (26Matsuzaki K. Minami T. Tojo M. Honda Y. Saitoh N. Nagahiro S. Saya H. Nakao M. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 275-286Google Scholar), whereas pSG5-Sp100 was kindly provided by Drs. J.-S. Seeler and A. Dejean. To generate VP16-PML fusion protein for mammalian two-hybrid assays, pcDNA3-Flag-PML vector was digested with BamHI and XbaI, and the 2.0-kb PML fragment was ligated into the pACT vector (CheckMate mammalian two-hybrid system, Promega Corp., Madison, WI). For VP16-Sp100 fusion protein, a PCR-generated Sp100 with flanking MluI (5′-end) and EcoRV (3′-end) was amplified from pSG5-Sp100 and ligated into a linearized pACT vector. Cell Culture and Transfections—HeLa cell line was obtained from RIKEN Cell Bank and HEK293 cell line was from the American Type Culture Collection. HeLa cells were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BIOSOURCE International) and HEK293 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Transient transfections of plasmid DNAs were performed with Trans-IT-LT-1 (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Specifically, 3 μl of TransIT-LT-1 reagent diluted with reduced serum Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) was mixed with total DNA in a ratio of 1:3 (DNA/LT-1) and applied to subconfluent cells in minimum essential medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with fetal bovine serum. Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes and transfected with the pEGFP-MEF constructs pcDNA3-Flag-PML, pSG5-Sp100, or a combination of these, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were subsequently blocked for 60 min at room temperature with PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated with a 1:100 dilution of primary antibody/rabbit anti-MEF (Transgenic, Inc., Kumamoto, Japan), mouse anti-PML (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or goat anti-Sp100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS and then stained with 1:100 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit, TRITC-conjugated anti-goat, TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse, or Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence analyses were carried out using Fluoview FV-500 confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Luciferase Assays—HeLa cells were seeded in 12-well plates. Co-transfection of various plasmids was performed with 0.2 μg of reporter plasmid and the indicated combinations of 0.1 μg of MEF, 0.5 μg of PML and 1 μg of Sp100 plasmids. Empty vector was added where necessary to ensure a constant amount of input DNA. Each sample was co-transfected with 10 ng of phRG-TK vector (Promega Corp.), which expresses Renilla reniformis luciferase to verify that differences in firefly luciferase reporter gene expression were not caused by differences in transfection efficiency. Twenty-four or forty-eight hours after transfection, the medium was removed and cells were harvested. Luciferase activity was measured using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega Corp.) and a luminometer (Turner Designs Luminometer Model TD-20/20; Promega Corp.). Absolute light emission generated from the luciferase enzyme reaction was determined. Relative luciferase activity was plotted; it represents the fold induction of activity generated by experimental treatment with respect to activity associated with basic vector alone. Values are shown as means ± S.E. (n = 3). RT-PCR—HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with the indicated combinations of 0.25 μg of MEF, 1.25 μg of PML, and 2.5 μg of Sp100 expression plasmids. Empty vector was added where necessary to ensure a constant amount of input DNA. Total RNA was extracted from 1 × 106 cells using Isogen (Nippongene). RT-PCR experiments were performed with an RNA PCR kit (ReverTra Dash; TOYOBO) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reverse transcription reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 30 min, 99 °C for 5 min, and 4 °C for 5 min. PCR was carried out at 98 °C for 1 min for 1 cycle, 98 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 74 °C for 90 s for 15-40 cycles, and 74 °C for 20 min for 1 cycle. The following primers were used: for lysozyme: 5′-primer, CTTCTCGAGCTAGGCACTCTGACCTAGCAGT; 3′-primer, AAAAATTCTCGAGTTACACTCCACAACCTTG; for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: 5′-primer, CGGGAAGCTTGTGATCAATGG; 3′-primer, (GGCAGTGATGGCATGGACTG. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—HeLa and HEK293 cells were grown on 10-cm dishes and HeLa cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of MEF and 7.5 μg of PML. For immunoprecipitation, 1 × 107 cells were treated with 5 mm dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate-2-HCl (Sigma) at 4 °C for 30 min. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by washing the cells with a buffer (150 mm NaCl and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The treated cells were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 5% deoxycholate, and 5% Nonidet P-40). The lysate was diluted to 1:5 by adding a buffer (150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and then mildly sonicated. After centrifuging for 20 min, the supernatant was incubated with appropriate antibodies for 90 min and then with protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed five times with a buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Immunoprecipitates were suspended in a Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.001% bromphenol blue). Samples were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked with a solution of PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk. After three washes in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, the membrane was incubated for 1 h in a 1:200 dilution of a primary antibody. After another three washes in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with 1:10,000 dilution of the corresponding secondary antibody. The membrane was reacted with chemiluminescence regent ECL (Amersham Biosciences) to visualize the blots. Mammalian Two-hybrid Assays—For mapping the interaction region, HeLa cells were transfected with pG5-luc reporter plasmid (Promega Corp.) and the combination of various pm-MEF constructs (containing the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain) and pACT-PML (containing the activation domains of the Herpes simplex virus VP16 protein). Protein-protein interactions were quantified by measuring luciferase activities. Overexpression of PML but Not Sp100 Induces Accumulation of MEF in PML Nuclear Bodies—To investigate the subnuclear distribution of MEF, we transfected GFP-MEF into HeLa cells in which the endogenous MEF gene was minimally expressed. As shown in Fig. 1A, GFP-MEF distributed itself diffusely throughout the nucleus except in the nucleoli. Simultaneous staining with the endogenous PML proteins showed that MEF only slightly co-localized with PML. Because several proteins interact with PML and are recruited into PML nuclear bodies, resulting in the regulation of their transcriptional activity (27Negorev D. Ishov A.M. Maul G.G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 59-68Google Scholar), we examined whether the subnuclear localization of MEF is affected by PML overexpression in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, overexpressed PML induced the accumulation of MEF in PML nuclear bodies. Another major constituent of the PML NBs, Sp100, has been shown to interact and co-localize with an ETS family member, ETS-1 (28Wasylyk C. Schlumberger S.E. Criqui-Filipe P. Wasylyk B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2687-2702Google Scholar). We investigated the possibility that Sp100 could affect the subnuclear localization of MEF and induce it to accumulate in the nuclear bodies. However, the overexpression of Sp100 did not significantly change the localization of MEF, which remained distributed in the nucleoplasm (Fig. 1B). The accumulation of MEF into the PML NBs is therefore specifically mediated by PML. Next, we determined the subnuclear localization of GFP-MEF when both PML and Sp100 were overexpressed. We co-transfected HeLa cells with GFP-MEF, PML, and Sp100 constructs and double-stained them with anti-PML and anti-Sp100 antibodies, which were subsequently immunolabeled with Cy5- and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. Fig. 1C showed that GFP-MEF localized outside of the PML NBs, whereas PML and Sp100 merged within these nuclear bodies. The data suggest that Sp100 overexpression can negatively affect the PML-induced accumulation of MEF in the nuclear bodies. PML Enhanced the MEF Transactivation of Lysozyme Gene—We next investigated the functional relevance of the accumulation of MEF in PML NBs by examining MEF transcriptional activity. We performed luciferase assay using lysozyme promoter, which is a target gene of MEF. Co-transfection of MEF and PML doubly up-regulated the lysozyme promoter activity (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the endogenous lysozyme gene expression was increased by PML co-transfection as demonstrated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2B). We also investigated the involvement of Sp100 on the regulation of MEF transactivation. Co-transfection of Sp100 with MEF did not significantly enhance MEF transactivation or endogenous lysozyme gene expression (Fig. 2, C and D). These results are consistent with the immunocytochemical data in Fig. 1B demonstrating that Sp100 did not affect MEF localization. However, the PML-enhanced MEF transactivation of the lysozyme promoter was decreased by the overexpression of Sp100 (Fig. 2E). The observable decrease in lysozyme transactivation could possibly have been a result of Sp100 overexpression blocking the translocation of MEF into the PML nuclear bodies (Fig. 1C). Western blots showed that the levels of both endogenous and transfected MEF were not altered by co-transfection of PML and Sp100 (Fig. 2, F-H), excluding the possibility that MEF protein expression levels were involved in the changes of PML-enhanced MEF transactivation of the lysozyme promoter. Collectively, these results suggest that PML positively contributes to the MEF-regulated lysozyme activation. Physical Interaction between MEF and PML—We next sought to determine whether MEF and PML interact directly. HeLa cells were transfected with MEF and PML. Immunoprecipitation with anti-PML antibody and subsequent Western blotting with anti-MEF antibody revealed that PML and MEF interacted under overexpressed conditions. This interaction was verified using anti-MEF antibody for immunoprecipitation, whereas anti-PML antibody was used to probe the blotted precipitates (Fig. 3A). To determine whether MEF and PML interaction occurs endogenously, we used the whole cell extracts from HEK293 cells, which highly express MEF. In the same manner, anti-PML and anti-MEF antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation and probing the blotted precipitates. Fig. 3B showed that MEF and PML also interacted at endogenous levels. We immunoprecipitated MEF and Sp100 in HEK293 cells but we could not detect an interaction between these two proteins under endogenous and overexpressed conditions (data not shown). Mapping the Interaction Domain of MEF—We next sought to map the region(s) of MEF responsible for interacting with PML by performing the mammalian two-hybrid assay in HeLa cells. We fused various parts of MEF to the DNA binding-domain of the yeast GAL4 protein. PML was fused to the activation-domain of the Herpes simplex virus VP16 protein. The interaction of these fusion proteins was tested in transiently transfected HeLa cells with a reporter construct driven by five GAL4 binding sites linked to luciferase. The result showed that MEF amino acids 477-663 strongly up-regulated the reporter gene together with PML much more than the full-length construct or any regions of MEF (Fig. 4B; data not shown). This implied that the C-terminal portion of MEF interacts with PML. We next sought to determine the region of MEF required for accumulation in PML nuclear bodies. We first examined the subnuclear localization of various GFP-MEF constructs. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that full-length MEF and MEF amino acids 1-517 accumulated in PML nuclear bodies. The shorter construct, MEF amino acids 1-347, failed to colocalize with PML (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that MEF amino acids 348-517 are essential for the translocation of MEF into the PML nuclear bodies. We performed luciferase assay using the lysozyme reporter plasmid to determine the region of MEF required for its transactivation enhanced by PML. Consistent with the immunofluorescence results, full-length MEF and MEF amino acids 1-517 up-regulated lysozyme transcription that was enhanced by PML. PML did not enhance the activity of MEF amino acids 1-347 (Fig. 5B). These data implied that MEF amino acids 348-517 are required not only for accumulation of MEF in PML nuclear bodies but also for the PML-enhanced MEF transactivation of the lysozyme gene.Fig. 5MEF amino acids 348-517 are required for accumulation in PML NBs and enhancement of MEF transactivation by PML. A, HeLa cells were co-transfected with the indicated GFP-MEF deletion constructs and PML expression plasmid. GFP-MEF (green) was detected by the intrinsic fluorescence of GFP. PML (red) was stained with anti-PML antibody. Yellow indicates co-localization. B, HeLa cells were co-transfected with the pGL2-lysozyme-luc reporter plasmid and the indicated combinations of full-length MEF or MEF deletion constructs and PML expression plasmids. Luciferase activity of the lysates was determined 48 h after transfection and is expressed as fold activation over the empty vectors.

Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-90Google Scholar, 10Pearson M. Carbone R. Sebastiani C. Cioce M. Fagioli M. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Minucci S. Pandolfi P.P.

Negorev D.G. Ishov A.M. Michaelson J.S. Yeh E.T. Tanguay R.M. Muller W.E. Maul G.G. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 513-524Google Scholar, 30Boisvert F.M. Kruhlak M.J. Box A.K. Hendzel M.J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1099-1106Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether heat shock stress altered the subnuclear distribution of MEF and its activity. HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-MEF, and heat-shock treatment was performed at 42 °C for 90 min before fixation or extraction of cells. MEF accumulated in endogenous PML nuclear bodies immediately after heat-shock treatment, and its transactivation was enhanced (Fig. 6, A and B). No change in MEF protein expression was observed after heat-shock treatment (Fig. 6B, right). To determine whether endogenous MEF can localize to PML nuclear bodies after heat shock, we used HEK293 cells, which express more MEF than HeLa cells. HEK293 were stained with MEF and PML antibodies and immunolabeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6C, endogenous MEF translocates to endogenous PML nuclear bodies immediately after heat shock. This result can correlate to the up-regulation of the lysozyme promoter observed after heat-shock treatment of HEK293 cells in the reporter assay (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, the endogenous lysozyme expression increased after heat-shock treatment as determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using HEK293 cells (Fig. 6E). Collectively, these results suggest that the accumulation of MEF in PML nuclear bodies and increase of MEF transactivation potential could be induced in response to heat shock stress. We have presented here the evidence that MEF transactivation is enhanced through a direct interaction between MEF and PML. Because MEF is constitutively localized in the nucleus (25Suico M.A. Koyanagi T. Ise S. Lu Z. Hisatsune A. Seki Y. Shuto T. Isohama Y. Miyata T. Kai H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 113-120Google Scholar), we first proposed that the elucidation of the subnuclear localization of MEF might provide valuable information as to how the MEF activity is regulated. Various transcription factors and co-factors display a diffuse nuclear localization pattern, but if PML is overexpressed, progesterone receptors and co-factors such as TIF1α are partially shifted to the nuclear body through their interaction with PML (31Zhong S. Delva L. Rachez C. Cenciarelli C. Gandini D. Zhang H. Kalantry S. Freedman L.P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 287-295Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulators such as p53 and CBP are also found in the nuclear body (32LaMorte V.J. Dyck J.A. Ochs R.L. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4991-4996Google Scholar, 33Jiang W.Q. Szekely L. Klein G. Ringertz N. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 289-300Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that transcriptional factors are recruited to the PML nuclear bodies either to take part in transcription or to be modified (4Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-90Google Scholar). In our immunofluorescence experiments, GFP-MEF was distributed throughout the nucleus but partly accumulated in PML nuclear bodies when PML was overexpressed (Fig. 1A). Although the physiological functions of PML nuclear bodies remain largely unknown, many studies have suggested that they play a role in the regulation of transcription (4Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-90Google Scholar, 34Borden K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5259-5269Google Scholar). Our luciferase assay data using the lysozyme reporter showed that the transcriptional activity of MEF was enhanced by PML overexpression. Moreover, we confirmed that MEF transactivation of endogenous lysozyme gene expression was up-regulated by PML in RT-PCR experiments (Fig. 2). Based on the co-localization and functional interaction of MEF and PML, we hypothesized and subsequently demonstrated by immunoprecipitation that these two proteins directly interact in mammalian cells. It has been observed that overexpressed bacterial lac repressor protein localized to the PML body independent of transcription (35Tsukamoto T. Hashiguchi N. Janicki S.M. Tumbar T. Belmont A.S. Spector D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 871-878Google Scholar); thus, interactions observed when PML and/or the partner protein are overexpressed are not always indicative of a real interaction. We proved that MEF and PML interact endogenously (Fig. 3B), precluding the possibility that the observable interaction was artifactual. The mammalian two-hybrid assays of the MEF deletion mutants showed that the physical interaction between MEF and PML involves the MEF amino acids 447-663 (Fig. 4B), a region that contains a proline-rich domain. Moreover, we showed that the residues 348-517 of MEF, but not the N-terminal region from 1-347, are necessary for MEF to co-localize with PML in the nuclear bodies as well as for the PML-enhanced MEF up-regulation of the lysozyme gene (Fig. 5). These results suggest that MEF amino acids 477-517, or the proline rich region of MEF, may be important for its interaction with PML. The amino acid proline is critical among the primary structures of many ligands for protein-protein interactions, and proline-rich sequences are commonly found in situations requiring rapid recruitment or interchange of several proteins (36Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). The proline-rich homeodomain protein has been reported to bind with the RING domain (the zinc-binding domain) of PML (37Topcu Z. Mack D.L. Hromas R.A. Borden K.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7091-7100Google Scholar). We previously indicated that MEF has two transactivation domains located in the N-terminal region of MEF (1-52), which is a potent transactivation domain, and in the C-terminal region (477-663), which is a weak transactivation domain (25Suico M.A. Koyanagi T. Ise S. Lu Z. Hisatsune A. Seki Y. Shuto T. Isohama Y. Miyata T. Kai H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 113-120Google Scholar). The present findings that the MEF C-terminal region interacts with PML, which enhances MEF transactivity, could partly explain the activation mediated by the C-terminal region of MEF. We have not yet determined, however, exactly how PML regulates MEF transactivity. It may be possible that MEF is recruited to PML nuclear bodies and undergoes modification such as SUMOylation (which we are currently investigating), resulting in the regulation of MEF transactivation potential. The reported interaction between the ETS family member ETS-1 and Sp100 (28Wasylyk C. Schlumberger S.E. Criqui-Filipe P. Wasylyk B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2687-2702Google Scholar) has led us to examine whether Sp100 can interact with MEF. We found that Sp100 affected neither subnuclear translocation of MEF nor MEF-mediated lysozyme transcription (Figs. 1B and 2, C and D). Consistent with these findings, we were unable to detect the direct interaction between MEF and Sp100 in both endogenous and exogenous conditions (data not shown). It is interesting to note, however, that when Sp100 was overexpressed, MEF did not localize in the nuclear bodies (Fig. 1C) and that the lysozyme activity decreased (Fig. 2E). It had been shown that cells lacking PML exhibited dispersion of all PML NB-associated proteins. However, the introduction of PML into PML-/- cells recruited all PML NB (or nuclear domain 10) proteins into the nuclear bodies, including Sp100, which does not interact with PML, suggesting the presence of mediator proteins (38Sternsdorf T. Guldner H.H. Szostecki C. Grotzinger T. Will H. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 42: 257-268Google Scholar, 39Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D. Vladimirova O.V. Neff N. Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. Strauss 3rd, J.F. Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 221-234Google Scholar). We predict that the affinity between nuclear domain 10 proteins and PML may be stronger than that between PML and MEF; hence, the overexpression of Sp100 disrupted the ability of PML to recruit MEF. Further studies will be required to resolve this point. Because cellular stresses affect PML nuclear bodies (reviewed in Ref. 40Eskiw C.H. Dellaire G. Mymryk J.S. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4455-4466Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of heat-shock treatment on the translocation of MEF into endogenous PML NBs. We showed that MEF, under endogenous or exogenous levels, was localized into the PML bodies after heat shock (Fig. 6, A and C). This correlates to an increase in MEF transcriptional activity in both HeLa and HEK293 cells (Fig. 6, B and D). Lysozyme expression was also up-regulated after heat shock in HEK293 cells under endogenous conditions (Fig. 6E). Heat shock disperses the PML NB components Daxx, Sp100 and SUMO-1, but not PML (29Nefkens I. Negorev D.G. Ishov A.M. Michaelson J.S. Yeh E.T. Tanguay R.M. Muller W.E. Maul G.G. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 513-524Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that MEF and PML can still functionally interact in the nuclear body. This explains, at least in part, the up-regulation of the reporter gene as well as the endogenous lysozyme gene observed after heat shock. In conclusion, our data suggest that the recruitment of MEF to nuclear bodies by PML is important for the enhancement of MEF-regulated lysozyme gene expression in epithelial cells. This study provides the first information of the interaction between an ETS family member and PML. Because MEF plays a role not only in innate immunity but also in tumor suppression (41Seki Y. Suico M.A. Uto A. Hisatsune A. Shuto T. Isohama Y. Kai H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6579-6586Google Scholar), it will be interesting to further elucidate the involvement of PML nuclear bodies in the tumor suppressive function of MEF. We thank Dr. J.-S. Seeler and Dr. A. Dejean for the pSG5-Sp100 construct."
https://openalex.org/W1982845482,"Jacob, Brenner, and Cuzin pioneered the development of the F plasmid as a model system to study replication control, and these investigations led to the development of the “replicon model” (Jacob, F., Brenner, S., and Cuzin, F. (1964) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 28, 329–348). To elucidate further the mechanism of initiation of replication of this plasmid and its control, we have reconstituted its replication in vitro with 21 purified host-encoded proteins and the plasmid-encoded initiator RepE. The replication in vitro was specifically initiated at the F ori (oriV) and required both the bacterial initiator protein DnaA and the plasmid-encoded initiator RepE. The wild type dimeric RepE was inactive in catalyzing replication, whereas a monomeric mutant form called RepE* (R118P) was capable of catalyzing vigorous replication. The replication topology was mostly of the Cairns form, and the fork movement was unidirectional and mostly from right to left. The replication was dependent on the HU protein, and the structurally and functionally related DNA bending protein IHF could not efficiently substitute for HU. The priming was dependent on DnaG primase. Many of the characteristics of the in vitro replication closely mimicked those of in vivo replication. We believe that the in vitro system should be very useful in unraveling the mechanism of replication initiation and its control.

We believe that the in vitro system should be very useful in unraveling the mechanism of replication initiation and its control. The discovery of the F factor and sexuality in bacteria by Lederberg and Tatum not only opened up the study of bacterial genetics (1Lederberg J. Tatum E.L. Nature. 1946; 158: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 2Lederberg J. Tatum E.L. Science. 1953; 118: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but also provided important genetic tools for gene mapping, strain construction, and generation of merodiploids that proved essential for the discovery of the regulation of protein synthesis and development of the “operon model” (3Jacob F. Monod J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 318-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (2992) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of the F factor, along with that of the λ phage, provided the genetic and experimental basis for the postulation of the “replicon hypothesis” (4Jacob F. Brenner S. Cuzin F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1964; 28: 329-348Crossref Google Scholar). The classical replicon hypothesis stated that every (prokaryotic) chromosome is a unit of replication that is regulated by two elements of control, i.e. a trans-acting initiator (now called initiator protein) encoded in the chromosome that binds to sequences at a cis-acting replicator site (now called replication origin) and positively controls the replication (4Jacob F. Brenner S. Cuzin F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1964; 28: 329-348Crossref Google Scholar). Later work, as discussed below, showed that the control involving ori-initiator protein interaction could be both positive and negative in nature (5McEachern M. Bott M.A. Tooker P.A. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7942-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 6Chattoraj D.K. Mason R.J. Wickner S.H.

In this work we have used the oriV (origin of vegetative replication; called oriF here) of F, the plasmid-encoded RepE initiator protein (8Eichenlaub R. Figurski D. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Murotsu T. Tsutsui H. Matsubara K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 196: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and multiple purified host-encoded proteins to develop a reconstituted replication system. The system was developed to further delineate the various steps of F replication initiation and its control and, in conjunction with the crystal structure of RepE-iteron DNA complex (10Komori H. Matsunaga F. Higuchi Y. Ishiai M. Wada C. Miki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), to attempt to provide a better understanding of replication initiation and its control at high resolution. In vivo experiments are consistent with a model of regulation of initiation that includes not only positive regulation of replication, as postulated by Jacob et al. (4Jacob F. Brenner S. Cuzin F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1964; 28: 329-348Crossref Google Scholar), by RepE-origin DNA interaction, but also negative regulation caused by the oligomerization of RepE that, in turn, promotes intramolecular coupling between a set of four iterons (19-bp repeated sequences) at the oriF and a second set of five of the same iterons located at a region down stream of the oriF called the incC, which is believed to shut down the oriF (7Uga H. Matsunaga F. Wada C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3856-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11Tolun A. Helinski D.R. Cell. 1981; 24: 687-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The minimal oriF contains the following sequence elements (Fig. 1A): two tandem dnaA sequences that bind to the host-encoded initiator DnaA; an AT-rich region followed by a consensus 13-mer sequence that is melted in the presence of RepE, DnaA, and HU proteins preparatory to the loading of the DnaB helicase (12Kawasaki Y. Matsunaga F. Kano Y. Yura T. Wada C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); and four 19-bp-long iterons, mentioned above, that bind to the RepE protein. The inverted repeats consisting of iteron sequences that bind to dimeric RepE are located immediately upstream of the open reading frame (ORF) 1The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; WT, wild type; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; dd, dideoxy (prefix); IHF, integration host factor. of RepE. The binding of dimeric RepE to the sequences autoregulates RepE transcription (13Ishiai M. Wada C. Kawasaki Y. Yura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3839-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Following the minimal oriF and the RepE ORF, five iterons that constitute the negative regulatory element called incC are present (Fig.1A). These iterons also bind to RepE and, presumably, simultaneous binding of the dimeric wild type (WT) RepE protein to the incC and ori iterons causes DNA looping and the consequent turning off of initiation (Fig. 1B). Although more definitive and mechanistic evidence is needed, there are some indirect in vitro and in vivo data suggesting that this looping shuts down initiation from oriF (7Uga H. Matsunaga F. Wada C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3856-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The wild type RepE protein is dimeric and postulated to be inactive in catalyzing replication initiation. Mutations in the region of the amino acid residues 111–161 cause a high copy number and the concomitant monomerization of the protein (14Matsunaga F. Ishiai M. Kobayashi G. Uga H. Yura T. Wada C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The mini F plasmid is not maintained in host cells that are deficient in DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE proteins. These chaperones are believed to act on dimeric RepE and convert it into active monomers, and the monomer-dimer equilibrium is believed to regulate the frequency of initiation of replication (13Ishiai M. Wada C. Kawasaki Y. Yura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3839-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Kawasaki Y. Wada C. Yura T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Previously, an in vitro system for replicating F plasmid that used a crude extract of a plasmid containing host cells was reported (16Muraiso K. Tokino T. Murotsu T. Matsubara K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 206: 519-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and a combination of DnaA, RepE, and HU proteins were shown to induce DNA melting in vitro at the oriF (12Kawasaki Y. Matsunaga F. Kano Y. Yura T. Wada C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To unravel further the mechanistic steps of replication initiation at the origin of replication and understand its control, mutants in the RepE protein, host replication proteins defective in replication of the plasmid, and a replication system reconstituted from highly purified proteins were needed. In this report, we describe the development of a reconstituted in vitro replication system consisting of up to 22 purified proteins that catalyzed origin-specific initiation and a complete round of replication of F plasmid DNA in vitro. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The Escherichia coli strain DH5α (F′/end 1, hsd R 17 (rk/mk)) gln v44 thi -1 rec A1 gyr A (Nalr) rel A1Δ (Lac YZA-arg F) U189 deoR [φ80 dLac Δ (LacZ) M15] was used for all cloning experiments. The plasmid pZOriF, which contained the minimal ori sequences consisting of the dnaA1 and dnaA2 sites, four iterons, and the sequences extending up to the end of RepE ORF, was used as the standard template DNA. A polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the ori DNA, which was cloned as an EcoRI-HindIII fragment into pUC19. The pUC 18-oriC template contained the minimal oriC region cloned in the pUC18 vector (17Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol.

The plasmid pHOC 2.6.1, which contains nine subunits of pol III under the control of a lac promoter, was a gift from Drs. C. McHenry and Arthur Pritchard (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). The E. coli strains BL21(DE3) and/or BL21(DE3/plysS) were used for all protein expression work. All clones were sequenced at the DNA sequencing facility of the Biotechnology Resource Laboratory of the Medical University of South Carolina. Enzymes—Highly purified RNase H and SSB were purchased from a commercial source (USB, Cleveland, OH). Plasmid-encoded RepE WT and RepE*(R118P) initiator proteins (5McEachern M. Bott M.A. Tooker P.A.

The fusion protein was purified on chitin-agarose affinity column in the absence of reducing agents, incubated at 4 °C for 12 h with 10 mm dithiothreitol followed by 5 h of further incubation at 11 °C to effect complete intein self-cleavage and release of the RepE moiety. The protein was further purified by gel filtration through a Superose 12 column. The host initiator protein DnaA was purified as described (18Seitz H. Weigel C. Messer W. Mol.

Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4124-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and HU (22Pellegrini O. Oberto J. Pinson V. Wery M. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) were purified as described. Gyrase A was purified from a pET15b clone, and gyrase B was from pTXB1 vector. Details of purification will be described elsewhere. PolIII* was purified from pHOC 2.6.1, and the β-sliding clamp was purified from an overproducer plasmid constructed in our laboratory by Dr. I. Patel In Vitro Reconstitution of oriF (oriV) Replication—In vitro origin-specific replication took place within a narrow window of protein concentrations as described below. The standard reaction mixture (in 25 μl) contained 40 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 40 μm dNTP, 3000 cpm/pmol [3H]dTTP, 5 mm ATP, 500 μm each CTP, UTP, and GTP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 20 μg/ml creatine kinase type I (Sigma), DNA template (200 ng), 1.5 μg of SSB, 10 ng of HU, 50 ng of DnaA, 50 ng of RepE*, 1 unit of RNase H, 540 ng of gyrase AB, 100 ng of DnaB, 50 ng of DnaC, 50 ng of DnaG, and 120 ng of pol III holoenzyme. The reaction components were assembled on ice and, after the addition of the initiator proteins, preincubated for 10 min. at 30 °C. DnaB, DnaC, DnaG, the Pol III holoenzyme, dNTPs, and rNTPs were then added to the reaction mixture to start the synthesis. The standard reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 30–60 min. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 20 μl of 0.2 m sodium pyrophosphate to each tube and precipitated with an equal volume of 10% chilled trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was trapped on a GF/C filter, washed with 95% ethanol, air dried, and total nucleotide incorporation was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The DNA synthesis was quantified by measuring the total picomoles of acid precipitable radioactivity in the reaction product. OriC Replication—Replication in vitro of oriC (cloned in pUC18) template was carried out as described (17Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 24Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Crooke E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The oriC replication was used as a system to check for optimizing the stoichiometry of the various components needed for maximal synthesis. Formation of a Preinitiation Complex—The kinetic assay was carried out as mentioned above with minor modifications. Each reaction mixture (175 μl) was assembled in triplicate at 0 °C and preincubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The preincubation mixture contained template DNA, HU, DnaA, and RepE*. The addition of ATP or its omission from the preincubation mix did not show a significant difference in net synthesis. In other reactions, DnaA, HU, and RepE* were omitted one at a time, and the effect of the omissions on net replication were measured. After preincubation, DnaB, DnaC, DnaG, the Pol III holoenzyme, dNTPs, and rNTPs were added to initiate replication at 37 °C, and 25 μl from each tube was taken out at the times indicated (under “Results”) to measure total DNA synthesis. Origin Identification by Dideoxy NTP (ddNTP) Incorporation—The reaction was carried out as described above but with the addition of [α-32P]dCTP, [α-32P]dATP, dGTP, and ddTTP from 30 to 110 μm. The reaction products were purified as described (23Khatri G.S. MacAllister T. Sista P.R. Bastia D. Cell. 1989; 59: 667-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), followed by digestion with EcoRI, XhoI, HindIII, and PvuI and electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels. The gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager and/or x-ray films, analyzed with the Imagequant™ software, and plotted. Analysis of Replication Intermediates in Neutral Two-dimensional Gels—We wished to determine the topology of the replication intermediates (i.e. Cairns form or the θ type versus possible rolling circles or the σ type) that were synthesized in the presence of [α32P]dNTPs by two-dimensional gel analyses. We linearized the product DNA with ScaI and resolved the intermediates in two-dimensional Brewer-Fangman gels at neutral pH (26Brewer B.J. Fangman W. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). In some cases, replication was carried out in the presence of various concentrations of ddNTP, and the labeled intermediates were purified, cleaved with ScaI, and resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described above. All of the samples yielded comparable gel patterns. Proteins Used in the in Vitro Replication—The SDS gel profiles of all of the proteins with the exception of RNaseH are shown in Fig. 2. The proteins appear to be nearly homogeneous with the exception of the pol III* complex, which appears to be ∼98% pure. The pol III holoenzyme was reconstituted from the core complex, the γ/τ complex, and the β-sliding clamp as described (27Abhyankar M.M. Zzaman S. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45476-45484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Replicon-specific Initiation—While working out conditions for replicon-specific initiation of a chimeric template DNA that had both origins (oriF and ori of pUC19), we discovered that replicon-specific initiation occurred within a narrow window of protein concentrations and reaction conditions that have been described in a preceding section. The chimeric template was used to take advantage of the much higher yield of the template DNA obtainable when the pUC19 ori was used to drive the replication of the chimeric template DNA. To make sure that the replication was F-specific, we attempted to replicate both the chimeric template and pUC19 DNA separately in vitro and observed that, whereas the reconstituted system elicited vigorous replication (up to ∼400 pmol in1hat37 °C) of the chimeric template, the pUC19 template did not yield measurable levels of replication under identical conditions (Fig. 3). It should be noted that the system did not include DNA polymerase I, which would have been needed to support replication from the ori of pUC19. The results are consistent with the conclusion that replication initiation from the chimeric template was at least specific to the oriF sequence. Role of Other Host-encoded Proteins—The effect of systematic omission of each of the protein components, ATP and DNA, on the net replication in vitro is shown in Fig. 4. The net replication in the complete system was relatively robust, yielding ∼200 pmol of synthesis at 37 °C in 1 h. Omission of ATP eliminated the synthesis. The synthesis was dependent on SSB, DnaA, RepE* (R118P), HU, DnaB, DnaC, DnaG, gyrase A and B, and pol III holoenzyme. The reaction did not require RNA polymerase but was dependent on DnaG primase, thus indicating that all of the primings were catalyzed by DNA primase. Although omission of RNaseH did not result in a marked reduction in overall synthesis, the enzyme was needed to suppress DnaA-independent synthesis (data not shown). Dependence on WT and Mutant Forms of RepE—We proceeded to determine the optimal concentration of WT RepE and that of a mutant form, RepE*, needed to catalyze maximal replication. Titration experiments showed that, whereas the mutant form of the protein catalyzed maximal replication (>200 pmol/h) at 50 ng per reaction, the WT protein was relatively inefficient and required 8-fold more protein to yield 100 pmol of reaction product in 1 h (Fig. 5). It should be noted that published work has shown that the WT RepE is dimeric, whereas the mutant form is monomeric (14Matsunaga F. Ishiai M. Kobayashi G. Uga H. Yura T. Wada C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is possible that the lower efficiency and much higher concentrations of the WT protein are needed to catalyze replication of the template reflects residual monomers present in the majority of dimers in the population of WT RepE. Optimal Concentration of DnaA Needed in Vitro—Previous work from other laboratories as well as our own have shown that plasmid replicons generally depend on dual initiators, namely host-encoded DnaA and plasmid-encoded initiators, for replication in vivo and in vitro (28Stenzel T.T. MacAllister T. Bastia D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29MacAllister T. Kelley W. Miron A. Stenzel T. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16056-16062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The same dual requirement for DnaA and RepE was also observed for F replication as reported here. We carried out in vitro replication over a range of concentrations of DnaA and discovered that replication was promoted within a relatively narrow window of DnaA concentration, with the optimum being ∼ 50 ng/reaction. Higher levels of DnaA inhibited the reaction, with significant inhibition observed at double the optimal DnaA concentration (i.e. at 100 ng; see Fig. 6). We have observed that a previously reported mutant form of DnaA that fails to bind to ATP (31Lu Y.B. Datta H.J. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5192-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was just as efficient in catalyzing replication of mini F in vivo as the wild type DnaA. 2S. Zzaman and D. Bastia, manuscript in preparation. In vitro, however, the mutant form of DnaA was inert. We suspect that the inactivity is due to the absence of chaperones that may be needed to refold and stabilize the mutant form of DnaA (32Hupp T.R. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13137-13142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Work is currently in progress to activate the mutant form of DnaA in vitro and to work out its interaction with RepE. Replication in the Presence of HU Versus IHF—Our previous work has shown that the plasmid R6K needed the DNA bending protein IHF to replicate efficiently, and the substitution of IHF by the structurally and functionally very similar protein HU significantly reduced the efficiency of replication in vitro (27Abhyankar M.M. Zzaman S. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45476-45484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We wished to examine whether the HU-dependent replication of oriF can be duplicated by replacing HU with the structurally and functionally similar protein IHF (33White S.W. Wilson K.S. Appelt K. Tanaka I. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 34Rice P.A. Yang S. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). We carried out sets of in vitro replication reactions of oriF with a range of concentrations of HU and IHF separately and compared and contrasted the data with similar reactions carried out with an oriC template (17Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The results showed that both oriC and oriF DNAs replicated optimally at ∼20 ng of HU protein per reaction (Fig. 7A). The oriC template replicated equally well in the presence of either HU or IHF, but, in contrast, IHF could not replace HU for optimal replication of oriF (Fig. 7B). The aforementioned observations are further discussed in a later section. It should be noted that Fig. 7B shows the concentrations of HU and IHF needed to elicit the maximum amount of synthesis; these concentrations were determined by titration experiments such as that shown in Fig. 7A. Reaction Kinetics—We investigated the extent of synthesis as a function of time and noticed, as in the case of other in vitro replication systems (24Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 27Abhyankar M.M. Zzaman S. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45476-45484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), a lag time of ∼5 min before a rapid synthesis was established (Fig. 8). To investigate whether the lag time was due to the time taken to form a preinitiation complex, we preincubated the template DNA with DnaA, RepE*, and HU in the presence or absence of ATP for 10 min at 30 °C to allow the formation of a DNA-protein complex and then added the remainder of the reaction components and continued incubation at 37 °C. We sampled equal aliquots of the reaction mixture as a function of time by counting the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity at each time point following the preincubation step. We found, as expected, that the preincubation step eliminated the lag period (Fig. 8). Withholding DnaA, RepE*, or HU from the preincubation mixture failed to eliminate the lag time, thus indicating that each of the aforementioned components was needed to form the preinitiation complex. The presence of ATP in the preincubation mixture had no effect on the subsequent elimination of the lag time, suggesting that the formation of the preinitiation complex was not energy dependent. Origin-specific Initiation—One of the critical questions to be answered was whether replication in vitro started from oriF. We attempted to answer the question by performing in vitro replication reactions with [α32P]dATP, [α32P]dCTP, dGTP, and TTP in the presence of different concentrations of unlabeled ddTTP. The rationale was that, at higher ratios of ddNTP/dNTP, the fork extension was more likely to be terminated close to the location of the oriF, thus limiting the label to the vicinity of the ori, making origin identification possible. The reaction products were passed through a Sephadex G75 column to eliminate any unincorporated label, digested with PvuI, EcoRI, HindIII, and XhoI, and resolved in an agarose gel. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film, and the label in each band was quantified with a PhosphorImager. The linearized map of the pZoriF plasmid template is shown in Fig 9A. In vivo, the replication is known to be bi-directional starting from the location of oriF, as determined by electron microscopy, and the area is in between the 1670-bp and the 210-bp fragments (8Eichenlaub R. Figurski D. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). If the replication was bi-directional in vitro, with increasing ratios of ddTTP/dTTP, the 1226-bp band should have had the highest specific activity with a decreasing gradient of radioactivity present in the adjacent fragments in both directions, proportionate to their distance from the ori. An inspection of the autoradiogram (Fig. 9B) and its quantification (Fig. 9C) showed that, with increasing ddTTP (e.g. at 70 μmol ddTTP), the 1226-bp fragment had the highest specific activity, and a detectable label was also present in the 896-bp, 210-bp, and 120-bp fragments. However, the 1670-bp fragment located to the right of the 1226-bp fragment rapidly lost the label with an increasing concentration of ddTTP (Fig. 9B). At 90 μmol ddTTP, the highest level of radioactivity was present in the 1226-bp band, and some label could be detected in the 896- and 210-bp bands. The 120-bp band was not visibly labeled because of its small size. At 110 μmol ddTTP, the 1226-bp band was the only visible band, although a small amount of label could still be measured in the 896-bp bands. The data are most consistent with the interpretation that most of the forks from oriF were moving from right to left, although the possibility that a minor population of forks were moving from left to right could not be eliminated by the experimental data. Topology of Replication in Vitro—We wished to examine the topology of in vitro replication intermediates to determine whether these resembled the Cairns type intermediates reported previously from in vivo experiments (8Eichenlaub R. Figurski D. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We replicated the template plasmid pZoriF (Fig. 3) in vitro with 32P-labeled precursors either in the presence or absence of 50 and 90 μmol ddTTP, purified the intermediates, linearized the molecules by cleavage with ScaI, and resolved the reaction products in two-dimensional neutral-neutral gels (26Brewer B.J. Fangman W. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). A representative autoradiogram of a two-dimensional gel is shown in Fig. 10. The gel profiles consistently showed a bubble arc that was consistent with Cairns type of replication topology. In addition, we also observed a prominent X arc that we believed was generated by breakage occurring in the replication bubbles. Normally the single stranded regions present at replication forks cause susceptibility to breakage. However, one must keep in mind that, in the present in vitro system, the Okazaki pieces are not processed and ligated because of the absence of DNA polymerase I and DNA ligase, thereby causing the formation of SS regions throughout a replication bubble and not necessarily just at the forks. We believe that random breakage at the SS DNA regions probably generated the X-shaped intermediates. Consistent with the relative locations of the ScaI site at which the DNA was linearized, with respect to the location of the ori, very few Y-shaped molecules would have been generated. Indeed, shorter exposures of the two-dimensional gels do not show any Y-shaped intermediates (Fig. 10B). Only after very prolonged exposures were faint Y-shaped molecules seen; they are diagrammatically represented as a dotted line in the diagram in Fig. 10A. The ddNTP incorporation results, taken together with the two-dimensional gel analysis, support the conclusion that the replication in vitro was mostly of the Cairns type and that the majority of the forks moved from right to left (heavy arrow in Fig. 9A). As contrasted with the in vitro data, the in vivo replication of mini F was reported to be bi-directional and of the Cairns type (8Eichenlaub R. Figurski D. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the early Cairns type replication of phage λ in vivo is mostly bi-directional, whereas the replication in vitro was observed to be unidirectional (35Mensa-Wilmot K. Seaby R. Alfano C. Wold M.C. Gomes B. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2853-2861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The principal reasons for developing a reconstituted replication system for F factor were as follows: (i) to investigate the mechanism of replication initiation and its control using not only the purified host and plasmid-encoded proteins but also mutant forms of the proteins; and (ii) to achieve the longer term goal to work out, in vitro, the mechanism of incC-mediated negative control of replication. The availability of the crystal structure of the monomeric RepE-iteron complex (10Komori H. Matsunaga F. Higuchi Y. Ishiai M. Wada C. Miki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) provides an opportunity to perform rationally guided site-directed mutagenesis of the RepE initiator. With these goals in mind, in this paper we have reconstituted the replication of the mini F factor template in vitro with all purified protein components and were able to achieve oriF-specific initiation. It is somewhat interesting that, unlike in the R6K system (27Abhyankar M.M. Zzaman S. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45476-45484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), IHF was less effective than HU in supporting optimal replication despite the fact that HU and IHF have very similar crystal structures (33White S.W. Wilson K.S. Appelt K. Tanaka I. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 34Rice P.A. Yang S. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and also have some similarity in function, because IHF could support oriC replication just as efficiently as HU (Fig. 7). Our earlier work has shown that the plasmid R6K, for optimal replication in vitro, requires IHF and that this requirement cannot be bypassed by supplying HU in the place of IHF (27Abhyankar M.M. Zzaman S. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45476-45484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Perhaps this observation can be explained by noting that R6K ori γ includes an ihf site, whereas the minimal sequence of oriF does not have a consensus ihf site (Fig. 1A). Binding of IHF to the cognate site causes a bending of the DNA (36Stenzel T.T. Patel P. Bastia D. Cell. 1987; 49: 709-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) that promotes more stable binding of DnaA to the ori with a single DnaA box. IHF-promoted DNA bending is also believed to promote physical interaction between the plasmid-encoded initiators of R6K and pSC101 with the DnaA protein, which is needed for origin melting and helicase loading (28Stenzel T.T. MacAllister T. Bastia D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Lu Y.B. Datta H.J. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5192-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Perhaps the availability of tandem dnaA boxes at the minimal oriF generates cooperativity and stable binding of DnaA without the need for IHF-induced DNA bending. Furthermore, the binding of HU to the origin region, although not strictly sequence-specific, also wraps/bends ori DNA and thus creates a “chromatin structure” that promotes protein-protein contact between DnaA and RepE at the ori. Both DnaA and RepE are needed for F replication, and, in fact, DnaA, HU, and RepE are needed for ori melting in vitro (12Kawasaki Y. Matsunaga F. Kano Y. Yura T. Wada C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have observed that both DnaA and DnaB proteins physically interact with RepE,2 and it would not be surprising if these protein-protein interactions were important in helicase loading (31Lu Y.B. Datta H.J. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5192-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 37Datta H.J. Khatri G.S. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 38Sharma R. Kachroo A. Bastia D. EMBO J. 2001; : 4577-4587Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to map the surfaces of DnaA and DnaB that interact with RepE and attempt to work out the ternary structures of host peptide-RepE-iteron complexes. Such information should be valuable in the understanding of replication initiation at high resolutions. The data derived from the reconstituted system presented here is consistent with previous in vivo data supporting the conclusion that wild type dimeric RepE is functionally inert and probably needs chaperones for activation by monomerization (13Ishiai M. Wada C. Kawasaki Y. Yura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3839-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 39Ishiai M. Wada C. Kawasaki Y. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5597-5603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have treated WT RepE with the chaperones DnaJ, DnaK, GrpE, and ATP but have not observed significant activation of the dimeric initiator in vitro, suggesting the requirement of additional proteins for the activation process.2 We are currently investigating this question further. The priming in the reconstituted system appears to be exclusively catalyzed by DnaG primase. Interestingly, DnaG primase physically interacts with the Pi initiator of R6K (40Abhyankar M.M. Reddy J.M. Sharma R. Bullesbach E. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6711-6719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and also with RepE of F.2 It would be interesting to determine whether an initiator-primase interaction plays a mechanistic role in primase loading and/or priming. Perhaps the initial recruitment of DnaG not only requires DnaG-DnaB interaction (20Lu Y.B. Ratnakar P.V. Mohanty B.K. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12902-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 41Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6058-6063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but also RepE-DnaG interaction. The replication of F occurred within a narrow range of concentrations of DnaA protein, and the excess of it was inhibitory. Perhaps the oligomerization of DnaA at higher concentration was the cause for this inhibition. Although RNaseH was not strictly needed for initiation, its absence caused significant amounts of a spurious initiation that was independent of RepE and DnaA. It appears that, as in the case of oriC, RNaseH also acts like a specificity factor that promoted ori-specific replication of F in vitro (24Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 42Kogoma T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7845-7849Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 43Kogoma T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 212-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). In summary, the in vitro reconstitution system described in this paper should be very useful in future attempts to unravel the precise roles of various protein-protein interaction in replication initiation in this model system. We hope that one should be able to work out the molecular mechanism of incC-mediated negative control of replication in vitro by using the system. We thank Dr. Dhruba Chattoraj for many useful discussions and Dr. Charles McHenry for the gift of several useful overproducer plasmids."

https://openalex.org/W2128359369,"Whereas the association of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules with the cytoskeleton and their recruitment into lipid rafts play a critical role during cognate T/antigen-presenting cell interactions, MHC class II-induced signals, regions, and residues involved in their association and recruitment have not yet been fully deciphered. In this study, we show that oligomerization of HLA-DR molecules induces their association with the cytoskeleton and their recruitment into lipid rafts. The association of oligomerized HLA-DR molecules with the cytoskeleton and their recruitment into lipid rafts occur independently. Furthermore, the association with the cytoskeleton is HLA-DR-specific, since oligomerization of HLA-DP triggers its recruitment only into lipid rafts. HLA-DR molecules devoid of both α and β cytoplasmic tails did not associate with the cytoskeleton, but their recruitment into lipid rafts was unimpeded. Deletion of either the α or β cytoplasmic tail did not affect the association of HLA-DR with the cytoskeleton and/or recruitment into lipid rafts. HLA-DR molecules that were devoid of the α cytoplasmic chain and that had their β cytoplasmic chain replaced with the HLA-DP β chain or with a β chain in which the residues at positions Gly226-His227-Ser228 were substituted by alanine no longer associated with the cytoskeleton. They were, however, still recruited into lipid rafts. Together, these results support the involvement of different regions of the cytoplasmic tails in the association and the recruitment of HLA-DR into different compartments. The differential behavior of HLA-DP and -DR with respect to their association with the cytoskeleton may explain the previously described difference in their transduced signals."
https://openalex.org/W1982927204,"Stimulation of Dictyostelium discoideum with cAMP evokes a change of the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). We analyzed the role of the filling state of Ca2+ stores for the [Ca2+] transient. Parameters tested were the height of the [Ca2+]i elevation and the percentage of responding amoebae. After loading stores with Ca2+, cAMP induced a [Ca2+]i transient in many cells. Without prior loading, cAMP evoked a [Ca2+]i change in a few cells only. This indicates that the [Ca2+]i elevation is not mediated exclusively by Ca2+ influx but also by Ca2+ release from stores. Reducing the Ca2+ content of the stores by EGTA preincubation led to a cAMP-activated [Ca2+]i increase even at low extracellular [Ca2+]. Moreover, the addition of Ca2+ itself elicited a capacitative [Ca2+]i elevation. This effect was not observed when stores were emptied by the standard technique of inhibiting internal Ca2+ pumps with 2,5-di-(t-butyl)-1,4-hydroquinone. Therefore, in Dictyostelium, an active internal Ca2+-ATPase is absolutely required to allow for Ca2+ entry. No influence of the filling state of stores on Ca2+ influx characteristics was found by the Mn2+-quenching technique, which monitors the rate of Ca2+ entry. Both basal and cAMP-activated Mn2+ influx rates were similar in control cells and cells with empty stores. By contrast, determination of extracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]e) changes, which represent the sum of Ca2+ influx and efflux, revealed a higher rate of [Ca2+]e decrease in EGTA-treated than in control amoebae. We conclude that emptying of Ca2+ stores does not change the rate of Ca2+ entry but results in inhibition of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase. Furthermore, the activities of the Ca2+ transport ATPases of the stores are of crucial importance for the regulation of [Ca2+]i changes.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium discoideum, the chemotactic stimulus cAMP activates a [Ca2+]i transient (4Schlatterer C. Gollnick F. Schmidt E. Meyer R. Knoll G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2107-2115Google Scholar, 5Yumura S. Furuya K. Takeuchi I. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2673-2678Google Scholar, 6Nebl T. Fisher P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2845-2853Google Scholar, 7Sonnemann J. Aichem A. Schlatterer C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 271-276Google Scholar). There are several hypotheses concerning the participation of individual parameters in this [Ca2+]i increase. One hypothesis favors extracellular Ca2+ influx to be the sole source for the generation of cAMP-induced [Ca2+]i transients (6Nebl T. Fisher P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2845-2853Google Scholar), since they were practically undetectable at extracellular Ca2+ levels of less than 10 μm (5Yumura S. Furuya K. Takeuchi I. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2673-2678Google Scholar, 6Nebl T. Fisher P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2845-2853Google Scholar). Internal stores were considered to be of minor importance and to be involved secondary to influx. Indeed, Ca2+ entry occurs shortly after binding of cAMP to its receptor (8Bumann J. Wurster B. Malchow D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 173-178Google Scholar). Influx is substantial already at 2–4 μm [Ca2+]e and was calculated to result in a [Ca2+]i elevation of roughly 10 μm (8Bumann J. Wurster B. Malchow D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 173-178Google Scholar). Subsequent activation of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases results in efflux, which, however, decreases in the course of differentiation (8Bumann J. Wurster B. Malchow D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 173-178Google Scholar) with a concomitant increase of the level of sequestered Ca2+ (9Schlatterer C. Buravkov S. Zierold K. Knoll G. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 101-111Google Scholar). The discrepancy between Ca2+ flux and [Ca2+]i measurements argues for a strong local and/or temporal restriction of the resulting [Ca2+]i signal; candidates responsible for restriction are highly efficient transport ATPases leading to sequestration of Ca2+ in stores. In contrast to the above model, a second hypothesis assigns a crucial function to internal stores as the trigger for the generation of agonist-activated [Ca2+]i transients, with liberation of sequestered Ca2+ being followed by capacitative Ca2+ entry. cAMP-induced Ca2+ influx was observed to be sensitive to agents known to empty storage compartments; it was blocked, for example, by inhibitors of H+ and Ca2+ pumps present on either the acidic, fatty acid-sensitive (10Rooney E.K. Gross J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8025-8029Google Scholar, 11Schaloske R. Sonnemann J. Malchow D. Schlatterer C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 541-548Google Scholar) or the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive store (11Schaloske R. Sonnemann J. Malchow D. Schlatterer C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 541-548Google Scholar, 12Flaadt H. Jaworski E. Malchow D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1131-1135Google Scholar, 13Schlatterer C. Schaloske R. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 661-667Google Scholar, 14Schaloske R. Schlatterer C. Malchow D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8404-8408Google Scholar), so both types of stores were concluded to regulate Ca2+ entry via capacitative Ca2+ influx (11Schaloske R. Sonnemann J. Malchow D. Schlatterer C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 541-548Google Scholar, 14Schaloske R. Schlatterer C. Malchow D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8404-8408Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the importance of Ca2+ influx and of the filling state of internal Ca2+ stores for agonist-induced [Ca2+]i transients. We found that preloading stores with Ca2+ led to an increase in the number of cells responding toward cAMP stimulation, which indicates that liberation of stored Ca2+ is the trigger for cAMP-induced Ca2+ influx. Reduction of the Ca2+ content of the stores increased the responsiveness of the cells by inhibition of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump rather than by an increased rate of Ca2+ influx. Moreover, we found that the classical way to activate capacitative Ca2+ entry does not operate in Dictyostelium; inhibition of the internal SERCA Ca2+ pump abolished both agonist- and CaCl2-induced Ca2+ entry. Materials—Fura2-dextran was obtained from MobiTec and cAMP from Roche Applied Science. BHQ was from Aldrich. Cell Culture—D. discoideum strain Ax2 was cultured as described (11Schaloske R. Sonnemann J. Malchow D. Schlatterer C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 541-548Google Scholar). Growing cells were washed by centrifugation and resuspension of the cell pellet in cold Sørensen phosphate buffer (17 mm Na+/K+-phosphate, pH 6.0). Amoebae were shaken at 2 × 107 cells/ml, 150 rpm, and 23 °C until use. Time, in hours, after induction of development is designated tx. [Ca2+]i Measurements and Mn2+-quenching Experiments—Cells were loaded at t2–t3 with fura2-dextran as described (15Sonnemann J. Knoll G. Schlatterer C. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 65-74Google Scholar). The use of fura2-dextran prevents the rapid sequestration and extrusion of the dye that occurs when either fura2 is loaded or cells are incubated with the membrane-permeant dye fura2-AM (16Schlatterer C. Knoll G. Malchow D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 172-181Google Scholar). Nonviable cells (typically 20–30% of the cells) and extracellular fura2-dextran were removed by repeated washing in an Eppendorf centrifuge (15Sonnemann J. Knoll G. Schlatterer C. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 65-74Google Scholar). Aliquots of washed amoebae in H5-buffer (5 mm Hepes, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.0; 2–5 μl) on glass coverslips were placed in a humid chamber until use. Under control conditions, 85–88 μl of H5 buffer containing different amounts of Ca2+ (1 μm to 1 mm) were added 15 min prior to the [Ca2+]i imaging experiment. When the effect of inhibition of intracellular pumps on agonist-activated [Ca2+]i transients was assayed, preincubation with 100–200 μm BHQ in 90 μl of H5 buffer was done for 5–15 min before the [Ca2+]i measurement. The effect of 50 μm BHQ itself on [Ca2+]i was tested in Ca2+-free H5 buffer; during the [Ca2+]i imaging experiment, 1 mm BAPTA was given to the amoebae 10 s prior to BHQ addition. In another set of experiments designed to reduce the Ca2+ content of the stores cells were preincubated for 1 h in H5 buffer plus 0.1 or 1 mm EGTA (10 μl). 10 min prior to the experiment, this solution was carefully removed and replaced by 100 μl of buffer to which variable amounts of CaCl2 had been added. This was repeated three times; final volume was 90 μl. All Ca2+-containing buffers were prepared with triple distilled H2O using plasticware throughout to avoid Ca2+ contamination by glassware. Free [Ca2+] of these buffers was measured with a [Ca2+]-sensitive electrode; the free [Ca2+] of nominally Ca2+-free H5 buffer was in the range of 150–600 nm. When 1 μm CaCl2 had been added, the free [Ca2+] ranged from 2–2.5 μm; when 3 μm CaCl2 was added, free [Ca2+] was in the range of 4–4.5 μm. External [Ca2+] values given under “Results” refer to the amounts of added CaCl2. [Ca2+]i imaging experiments were performed at the aggregation-competent stage of development (t7–t8) as described (11Schaloske R. Sonnemann J. Malchow D. Schlatterer C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 541-548Google Scholar); stimulation was done by adding 10 μl of cAMP (10 μm) or 10 μl of CaCl2 (30 μm to 10 mm) in H5 buffer. The values given for a [Ca2+]i change refer to the increase above basal [Ca2+]i. For Mn2+-quenching assays, cells in H5 buffer were challenged with Mn2+ or Mn2+/cAMP. Fluorescence quenching was measured at 360-nm excitation; influx rates are expressed as decrease of fluorescence units/s. Electrode Recordings of [Ca2+]e—The extracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]e) in cell suspensions was measured as described (11Schaloske R. Sonnemann J. Malchow D. Schlatterer C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 541-548Google Scholar). Fluxes were analyzed at t5.5–t7 in cells with emptied (EGTA preincubation) stores or after inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into stores by BHQ treatment. Amoebae were incubated in EGTA (5 mm; 30 min) or in BHQ (100 μm; 15 min). Then cells were washed and resuspended at 5 × 107 cells/ml in 5 mm Tricine, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.0. All measurements were done in this buffer (2-ml test volume). External [Ca2+] Influences Agonist-induced [Ca2+]i Responses—We investigated the dependence of cAMP-activated [Ca2+]i transients on extracellular Ca2+ levels by analysis of the reaction in buffer containing different amounts of Ca2+. At our standard condition (i.e. when incubated in 1 mm CaCl2 for 10–15 min), roughly 70% of amoebae displayed an agonist-induced global [Ca2+]i increase of 31 ± 3 nm (mean ± S.E.; Table I and Figs. 1 and 2). The average basal [Ca2+]i under this condition was 50 ± 0.3 nm, which was similar to basal [Ca2+]i of 51 ± 0.4 nm in nominally Ca2+-free buffer. Lowering external Ca2+ affected the fraction of cells reacting toward stimulation with cAMP. In the presence of 10 μm CaCl2 a [Ca2+]i elevation occurred in only 17% of amoebae; its height (34 ± 3nm; mean ± S.E.) was similar to that observed at 1 mm Ca2+. When further reduced to 1 μm CaCl2, a remainder of 7% of cells responded upon cAMP stimulation with an average [Ca2+]i change of 24 ± 3 nm. The duration of the [Ca2+]i increase was independent of the level of extracellular Ca2+ and lasted 30 ± 0.8 s (mean ± S.E.). In nominally Ca2+-free buffer, a cAMP-elicited [Ca2+]i change was not observed (29 cells tested). According to Nebl and Fisher (6Nebl T. Fisher P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2845-2853Google Scholar), [Ca2+]i increases are mediated solely by Ca2+ influx. However, when 1 mm CaCl2 was added just prior to or concomitantly with cAMP, the percentage of responding cells was only 5% (214 cells tested in 16 independent experiments) instead of the ∼70% seen at the standard condition. This indicates that the mere presence of extracellular Ca2+ does not result in sufficient influx to achieve a global [Ca2+]i elevation but that there are other components that participate in its control. We therefore sought to determine the influence of the state of internal storage compartments on the generation of the [Ca2+]i transient.Table IPercentage of cells displaying a [Ca2+]i transient after cAMP addition[Ca2+]PreincubationNoneEGTA (0.1 mm)EGTA (1 mm)%%%1 mm67 (107)75 (96)25 (77)100 μm54 (112)69 (90)40 (157)30 μm43 (90)73 (63)49 (107)10 μm17 (210)78 (202)57 (87)3 μm15 (134)80 (136)21 (24)1 μm7 (151)38 (85)ND Open table in a new tab Fig. 2The height of an agonist-evoked [Ca2+]i increase at different external [Ca2+] is affected by the state of the stores. Amoebae were challenged with 1 μm cAMP at t7–t8. The average [Ca2+]i change above basal [Ca2+]i is shown as mean ± S.E. Values of extracellular Ca2+ refer to doses of CaCl2 added to the buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Filling State of the Stores Affects the Agonist-induced [Ca2+]i Response—We reasoned that when mechanisms of Ca2+ uptake in internal stores are blocked, then cAMP-induced [Ca2+]i transients might be seen also at low extracellular [Ca2+]. Inhibitors of SERCA-type Ca2+-ATPases attenuate Ca2+ entry elicited by both cAMP and fatty acids such as arachidonic acid (AA) (11Schaloske R. Sonnemann J. Malchow D. Schlatterer C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 541-548Google Scholar), yet residual Ca2+ liberation and subsequent diminished influx might still result in a [Ca2+]i increase when sequestration is blocked. We therefore tested the effect of the inhibitor BHQ on cAMP-, AA-, and Ca2+-induced [Ca2+]i transients. The more commonly employed inhibitor thapsigargin was not used, since we found it to be effective in D. discoideum only at roughly 50–200 times higher concentrations than generally applied (17Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Google Scholar, 18Bautista D.M. Hoth M. Lewis R.S. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 877-894Google Scholar). The addition of 50 μm BHQ itself to cells in Ca2+-free buffer containing 1 mm BAPTA elicited a small transient [Ca2+]i elevation (28 ± 2nm; mean ± S.E.) in 36% of the amoebae (146 cells tested in 20 determinations in four independent experiments). However, in cells preincubated with 100–200 μm BHQ, both cAMP- and AA-activated [Ca2+]i elevations were absent, showing that residual Ca2+ fluxes were not sufficient to trigger a global [Ca2+]i change (61 and 119 cells analyzed in 4 and 8 determinations in 2 and 3 independent experiments for cAMP and AA, respectively). By contrast to data from other cell systems where store emptying via pump inhibition represents the standard protocol to activate capacitative Ca2+ entry (3Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Google Scholar), application of 1 mm CaCl2 to Dictyostelium cells preincubated with BHQ resulted in no capacitative [Ca2+]i increase (275 cells tested in 32 determinations in seven independent experiments). Moreover, when Ca2+ entry was assayed by analysis of extracellular [Ca2+] changes in cell suspensions with an ion-sensitive electrode, there was a significant (p = 0.001) reduction of the rate of Ca2+ influx after preincubation with 100 μm BHQ; the rate of Ca2+ entry induced by the addition of 10 μm CaCl2 was diminished by 56% compared with control cells (rate of 0.32 ± 0.06 μm/min in control cells versus 0.14 ± 0.01 μm/min in BHQ-treated cells; mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments and seven determinations each). These results argue for a requirement of active internal pump(s) to stimulate Ca2+ entry. Since BHQ was also reported to affect plasma membrane Ca2+ channels and thus might block Ca2+ entry directly or indirectly (19Mason M.J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20856-20862Google Scholar, 20Fusi F. Saponara S. Gagov H. Sgaragli G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 988-996Google Scholar), we compared basal [Ca2+]i in cells pretreated with 100–200 μm BHQ with that of untreated cells, in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. We found that in nominally Ca2+-free buffer, cells incubated with BHQ had a basal [Ca2+]i that was not significantly different from that of untreated amoebae (i.e. in the range of 51 nm) (see above). By contrast, in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, basal [Ca2+]i was significantly lower in untreated cells (average of 50 nm) (see above) than in cells incubated with BHQ (on average 86 ± 1nm after 8–15 min of incubation; mean ± S.E. of 145 cells) arguing against inhibition of Ca2+ entry by BHQ. Therefore, we conclude that in Dictyostelium BHQ acts by blockade of Ca2+ uptake into internal stores rather than by inhibiting plasma membrane Ca2+ channels. An alternative method to manipulate the filling state of the stores without impairing uptake mechanisms is to incubate amoebae with EGTA. This should lead to a depletion of sequestered Ca2+, since the presence of the chelator in the medium should result in leakage of Ca2+ from the amoebae. Indeed, continuous efflux of 45Ca2+ was observed in amoebal suspensions after washing in Ca2+-free buffer (21Wick U. Malchow D. Gerisch G. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1978; 2: 71-79Google Scholar), and quantitative x-ray microanalysis revealed that the amount of Ca2+ stored intracellularly critically depends on the level of extracellular Ca2+ (9Schlatterer C. Buravkov S. Zierold K. Knoll G. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 101-111Google Scholar, 22Schlatterer C. Walther P. Müller M. Mendgen K. Zierold K. Knoll G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 171-182Google Scholar). Table I shows that EGTA pretreatment strongly affected the dependence of cAMP-activated [Ca2+]i transients on extracellular Ca2+ levels. Starting from an average basal [Ca2+]i of 57–59 nm, a greater portion of cells displayed an agonist-induced [Ca2+]i increase at low external [Ca2+]. In 38% of amoebae preincubated with 0.1 mm EGTA, a transient [Ca2+]i elevation was observed in the presence of 1 μm CaCl2. The [Ca2+]i increase was significantly higher than under control conditions and even augmented when cells had been treated with 1 mm EGTA (Figs. 1 and 2). However, under this experimental condition, amoebae appeared contracted and occasionally detached from the substrate after the addition of cAMP; detached amoebae were not included in the determinations. Detachment was not observed after preincubation with 0.1 mm EGTA; cells were spread and fully adherent to the substrate. Emptying of stores by EGTA treatment also influenced the [Ca2+]i response upon the addition of CaCl2. Just 10–12% of the cells kept in nominally Ca2+-free buffer displayed a transient [Ca2+]i elevation after challenge with 1 or 0.1 mm CaCl2 (Table II). By contrast, many more amoebae reacted when preincubated with 0.1 or 1 mm EGTA (30 and 50%, respectively). [Ca2+]i transients occurred even when low doses of 10 and 3 μm CaCl2 were added, albeit in fewer cells. Again, the height of the increase was even augmented after preincubation with 1 mm EGTA (Figs. 3 and 4). The duration of the increase was also higher (25 ± 0.8 s in cells treated with 0.1 mm EGTA versus 21 ± 0.5 s in control amoebae; mean ± S.E.). These data indicate that when emptying of stores is done by EGTA incubation, capacitative Ca2+ entry mechanisms are operative.Table IIPercentage of cells displaying a [Ca2+]2 transient after the addition of CaCl2CaCl2 additionPreincubationNoneEGTA (0.1 mm)EGTA (1 mm)%%%1 mm10 (122)30 (96)50 (77)100 μm12 (94)33 (90)29 (157)30 μm4 (84)8 (63)22 (107)10 μm0 (89)14 (184)3 μm1.5 (136) Open table in a new tab Fig. 4The average height of a [Ca2+]i increase induced by CaCl2 depends on preincubation conditions.

The kinetics of Ca2+ influx were measured via quenching of fura2-dextran fluorescence by Mn2+. The basal influx rate increased by a factor of 5 in the presence of cAMP (Fig. 5). However, neither basal nor cAMP-stimulated influx rates were significantly increased by pretreatment with EGTA (Table III), so this parameter does not seem to be responsible for the increased percentage of responding cells and the altered height of the [Ca2+]i increase after EGTA incubation. However, when basal Ca2+ fluxes were assayed with a Ca2+-sensitive electrode in cell suspensions, there was a significant (p < 0.001) difference between the response of control amoebae and those preincubated with EGTA (Fig. 6). In suspensions of EGTA-treated cells, the rate of the [Ca2+]e decrease observed after the addition of Ca2+ was larger than in control cells. Changes in the extracellular free [Ca2+] represent the sum of influx and efflux, whereas Mn2+ quenching measures influx only, so the difference between the results argues for an inhibition of the plasma membrane pump after preincubation with EGTA. Further analysis of Ca2+ fluxes activated by the addition of 1 μm cAMP supported the view of an inhibitory effect on plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) activity. We found that the rate of Ca2+ efflux that follows cAMP-induced Ca2+ entry was significantly diminished (Fig. 6) in cells pretreated with EGTA (0.86 ± 0.06 μm/min as compared with 1.49 ± 0.07 μm/min in control amoebae; mean ± S.E. of at least 15 determinations in four independent experiments). The amount of Ca2+ released was also significantly reduced. Shortly after the removal of EGTA, Ca2+ efflux was in the range of only 20–30% of the preceding influx and gradually increased to roughly 100%; on average, it amounted to 76 ± 7% in EGTA-treated amoebae versus 116 ± 7% in control cells (mean ± S.E. of at least 11 determinations in four independent experiments).Table IIIRate of basal and cAMP-induced Mn2+ influxStimulationPreincubationNoneEGTA (0.1 mm)1 μm Mn2+ (ne/nd/nc)0.44 ± 0.1(5/17/852)0.69 ± 0.2(2/9/504)1 μm Mn2+/1 μm cAMP (ne/nd/nc)2.23 ± 0.3(4/16/895)2.4 ± 0.2(2/10/529) Open table in a new tab Fig. 6Extracellular Ca2+ fluxes proceed at an altered rate after preincubation of amoebae with EGTA.

The first and second cAMP stimulus were applied 9 and 16 min after the removal of EGTA, respectively. Both the amount and the rate of Ca2+ efflux are reduced as compared with control cells. Measurements were done at t6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The aim of this study was to investigate the role of extracellular Ca2+ entry and of the filling state of stores for the generation of agonist-induced [Ca2+]i changes. cAMP activated a [Ca2+]i increase in 70% of the cells under our standard conditions (i.e. when 1 mm CaCl2 had been present for roughly 15 min). The reason that a reaction was not detected in all cells tested most probably reflects an oscillatory responsiveness. Oscillations of various parameters (e.g. extracellular Ca2+ fluxes) are well known in Dictyostelium (23Bumann J. Malchow D. Wurster B. Differentiation. 1986; 31: 85-91Google Scholar). In our measurements, we found a clear response pattern within the batches of cells tested; either all cells of one batch reacted or not. Thus, the 70% of responding cells are due to seven batches where all amoebae reacted and three batches where they did not. This distribution matches well with the temporal oscillation pattern (23Bumann J. Malchow D. Wurster B. Differentiation. 1986; 31: 85-91Google Scholar), and we conclude that our results reflect an oscillatory behavior rather than, for example, a difference in the responsiveness of the predifferentiated prestalk and prespore cells. If this was the case, one would expect that indeed 70% of the amoebae in one batch would respond and 30% would not. By contrast to our standard condition, a reaction was observed in only 5% of amoebae when 1 mm CaCl2 was added shortly before or concomitantly with the agonist. This result strongly argues against the notion that Ca2+ influx exclusively mediates the cAMP-induced [Ca2+]i increase as had been postulated previously (6Nebl T. Fisher P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2845-2853Google Scholar). Continuous reduction of the extracellular Ca2+ level decreased the fraction of reacting amoebae but not the height of the [Ca2+]i elevation, which indicates an all-or-none reaction of the amoebae. Our single cell imaging results provide evidence for a functional heterogeneity of the cells that in suspension measurements yield a continuous decrease in the [Ca2+]i transient as documented by Nebl and Fisher (6Nebl T. Fisher P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2845-2853Google Scholar). Heterogeneous response characteristics were observed in other cell types such as PC12 cells as well (24Grohovaz F. Zacchetti D. Clementi E. Lorenzon P. Meldolesi J. Fumagalli G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1341-1350Google Scholar). The molecular nature of the process(es) responsible for the different reactions in Dictyostelium amoebae at low external Ca2+ is unknown. It might be due to a different sensitivity toward cAMP stimulation or to more efficient Ca2+ signaling, if, for example, the Ca2+ content of internal stores was different. Our data support the hypothesis that filled stores release Ca2+ upon cAMP activation, which causes Ca2+ entry. We postulate that the filling state of the store and the amount of Ca2+ liberated determine the characteristics of Ca2+ influx and thus the [Ca2+]i elevation, whether it is restricted locally or spread throughout the cell's cytosol. First we manipulated the Ca2+ content of the stores by incubating amoebae with the SERCA-type Ca2+-ATPase blocker BHQ (25Moore G.A. McConkey D.J. Kass G.E. O'Brien P.J. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 331-336Google Scholar). Until now there has been no direct biochemical evidence that BHQ binds to internal Ca2+-ATPases in Dictyostelium. However, due to the results of earlier studies showing inhibition of Ca2+ uptake into partially purified stores by BHQ (14Schaloske R. Schlatterer C. Malchow D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8404-8408Google Scholar, 26Gröner M. Malchow D. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 105-111Google Scholar) and the fact that in suspensions of cells with permeabilized plasma membranes BHQ dose-dependently inhibits the sequestration of Ca2+ (12Flaadt H. Jaworski E. Malchow D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1131-1135Google Scholar), we consider the effects of BHQ to be caused by an influence on sequestration characteristics. The [Ca2+]i transient after BHQ addition was caused by liberation of stored Ca2+, since (i) it occurred in the extracellular presence of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA and (ii) BHQ elicits release of 45Ca2+ from cells (12Flaadt H. Jaworski E. Malchow D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1131-1135Google Scholar). Neither cAMP nor arachidonic acid induced a [Ca2+]i elevation in BHQ-treated amoebae. Unexpectedly, the addition of Ca2+ itself also resulted in no significant [Ca2+]i increase, although capacitative Ca2+ entry should have been operative. Similarly, the rate of Ca2+-activated Ca2+ influx as measured in cell suspensions with an electrode was diminished after BHQ pretreatment. These findings differ from data of other nonexcitable cells, where inhibition of internal Ca2+ pumps triggers capacitative Ca2+ entry (27Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Google Scholar). From these results, we conclude that in Dictyostelium, unlike in other cell systems, capacitative Ca2+ entry requires active pumps on internal stores. How the activity of the intracellular ATPases is coupled to influx is at present unknown. It appears that without an active pump the driving force for Ca2+ influx is missing. This seems clear in the case of low external Ca2+ concentrations; however, it seems to hold true also for elevated levels, because the cells must control their Ca2+ content at highly variable extracellular [Ca2+], which occur in their natural habitat. Emptying of stores by incubation of amoebae with EGTA did not inhibit pumping mechanisms. Indeed, this pretreatment resulted in agonist-induced [Ca2+]i transients at low extracellular [Ca2+] and after the addition of low amounts of Ca2+. To test whether EGTA treatment directly affects regulation of the Ca2+ channel mediating influx we used the Mn2+-quenching technique. Mn2+ influx is an indirect measure of Ca2+ fluxes across the plasma membrane, since many Ca2+ channels are permeable to Mn2+ (28Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium, the nature of the Ca2+-channel is not yet known and electrophysiological data are not available; inhibition of Ca2+ influx by gallopamil 2D. Malchow, unpublished results. indicates the presence of an L-type-like channel. We observed basal and cAMP-activated influx already at 1 μm Mn2+; in mammalian cell systems, the dose of Mn2+ is usually higher, in the range of 50–100 μm (29Broad L.M. Powis D.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 759-764Google Scholar, 30Madge L. Marshall I.C. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 351-369Google Scholar). This indicates that (i) the amoebae can take up Ca2+ at a rather shallow concentration gradient across the plasma membrane and that (ii) their influx mechanisms are even strongly augmented by cAMP stimulation. The rate of Ca2+ influx was independent of the filling state of the stores. Both basal and agonist-activated Mn2+ influx were similar in control cells and cells preincubated with EGTA. Therefore, altered influx characteristics are unlikely to account for the fact that in cells with empty stores the addition of cAMP at low extracellular [Ca2+] or the addition of CaCl2 itself evoked a transient [Ca2+]i elevation. By contrast, in EGTA-treated amoebae, Ca2+ fluxes across the plasma membrane were augmented when assayed with a Ca2+-sensitive electrode in cell suspensions. This rather argues for an inactivation of the PMCA, resulting in a larger net amount of extracellular Ca2+ taken up and thus a greater [Ca2+]i elevation. Delayed activation of the PMCA during capacitative Ca2+ entry was observed in other cell systems such as endothelial cells (31Snitsarev V.A. Taylor C.W. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 409-417Google Scholar) and Jurkat cells (18Bautista D.M. Hoth M. Lewis R.S. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 877-894Google Scholar). Reduced PMCA activity could account for the observation that Ca2+-induced [Ca2+]i elevations occurred at lower doses of Ca2+, were higher, and lasted longer in EGTA-treated amoebae than in control cells. On the other hand, the activity of intracellular pumps must be high and might even increase after preincubation with EGTA. The surplus rate of Ca2+ influx of 0.19 μm/min measured with the Ca2+ electrode in suspensions of cells with empty stores compared with control cells should result in a [Ca2+]i change by 7 μm/min (calculated volume of 108 amoebae: 52 μl (radius: 5 μm); decrease by 0.38 nmol/min in test volume of 2 ml), yet the [Ca2+]i transient was increased by roughly 50–90 nm only. Indeed, Ca2+ uptake into partially purified stores is augmented by EGTA treatment of cells. 2D. Malchow, unpublished results. In Dictyostelium, high affinity Ca2+-ATPases were described both in the plasma membrane (32Böhme R. Bumann J. Aeckerle S. Malchow D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 904: 125-130Google Scholar, 33Milne J.L. Coukell M.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 223-230Google Scholar) and in intracellular compartments (34Milne J.L. Coukell M.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 185: 21-32Google Scholar, 35Moniakis J. Coukell M. Forer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28276-28281Google Scholar). Böhme et al. (32Böhme R. Bumann J. Aeckerle S. Malchow D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 904: 125-130Google Scholar) calculated the activity of the PMCA to be sufficient to transport Ca2+ at a rate of roughly 5 × 106 ions/cell/min; this corresponds to removal of Ca2+ from the cytosol at greater than 10 μm/min. Similarly, the rates of Ca2+ uptake into stores by intracellular pumps of roughly 0.3 and 1 nmol/mg protein observed by Milne and Coukell (34Milne J.L. Coukell M.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 185: 21-32Google Scholar) and Moniakis et al. (35Moniakis J. Coukell M. Forer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28276-28281Google Scholar), respectively, should result in clearance of Ca2+ from the cytosol at a rate comparable with that of the PMCA. Activation of both pumps is most probably responsible for a strong local and/or temporal restriction of agonist-induced [Ca2+]i elevations at low external [Ca2+] and the fact that a cytosolic increase is detected in few cells only, although under this condition (i) stored Ca2+ is liberated (12Flaadt H. Jaworski E. Malchow D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1131-1135Google Scholar), (ii) Ca2+ entry was calculated to be sufficient to increase [Ca2+]i by roughly 10 μm (8Bumann J. Wurster B. Malchow D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 173-178Google Scholar), and (iii) the rate of Mn2+ influx was increased 5-fold when compared with basal influx. Under conditions of reduced PMCA activity after EGTA incubation, cAMP stimulation allows a larger net amount of Ca2+ to enter the cells, which thus can spread in the interior of the amoebae resulting in a global [Ca2+]i elevation. Our finding that efflux of Ca2+ that follows cAMP-activated influx was diminished and slower in EGTA-treated amoebae supports this view. The [Ca2+]i transient is smaller than expected from the difference in the flux rates as intracellular pumps are activated. An alternative mechanism for the extrusion of Ca2+ could be the presence of a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in the plasma membrane (for a review, see Refs. 36Bauer P.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 514: 253-274Google Scholar and 37Szerencsei R.T. Winkfein R.J. Cooper C.B. Prinsen C. Kinjo T.G. Kang K. Schnetkamp P.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 976: 41-52Google Scholar). However, in D. discoideum, there is no experimental evidence favoring the existence of such an exchanger. In addition, all [Ca2+]i imaging and [Ca2+]e measurements are routinely performed in the absence of Na+, which renders a role for a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger for mediation of Ca2+ fluxes unlikely. Fig. 7 depicts a model of Ca2+ fluxes in D. discoideum. In a first step (1) cAMP activates the signaling cascade, leading to liberation of stored Ca2+, which then (2) results in Ca2+ entry. Ca2+ release and activation of the SERCA pump are required to induce influx. The elevation of the cytosolic Ca2+ level is followed by activation of the PMCA and Ca2+ efflux (3). When stores are filled, the amount of released Ca2+ is expected to be greater than under conditions of reduced Ca2+ contents. Continuous emptying of the store leads to activation of the SERCA pump and inhibition of the PMCA pump in order to restore the Ca2+ level in the storage compartments. This condition, for example, by EGTA preincubation, allows for the generation of a global [Ca2+]i increase after cAMP application at low external [Ca2+] or even after the addition of low amounts of CaCl2. In conclusion, store-operated Ca2+ entry in Dictyostelium cells is not regulated by an increase in Ca2+ channel permeability but rather by an inhibition of their PMCA. In addition, capacitative Ca2+ entry in Dictyostelium is different from other cell systems in that it depends on an active Ca2+ pump of internal stores. When stimulated with cAMP, liberation of stored Ca2+ activates Ca2+ entry via the channels and allows for a greater rate of influx. At the same time, the activity of intracellular pumps is augmented, thus limiting the resulting [Ca2+]i increase.
