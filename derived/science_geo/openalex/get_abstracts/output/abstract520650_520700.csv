https://openalex.org/W2163242195,"The process of carbon capture and sequestration has been proposed as a method of mitigating the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. If implemented, the cost of electricity generated by a fossil fuel-burning power plant would rise substantially, owing to the expense of removing CO2 from the effluent stream. There is therefore an urgent need for more efficient gas separation technologies, such as those potentially offered by advanced solid adsorbents. Here we show that diamine-appended metal-organic frameworks can behave as ‘phase-change’ adsorbents, with unusual step-shaped CO2 adsorption isotherms that shift markedly with temperature. Results from spectroscopic, diffraction and computational studies show that the origin of the sharp adsorption step is an unprecedented cooperative process in which, above a metal-dependent threshold pressure, CO2 molecules insert into metal-amine bonds, inducing a reorganization of the amines into well-ordered chains of ammonium carbamate. As a consequence, large CO2 separation capacities can be achieved with small temperature swings, and regeneration energies appreciably lower than achievable with state-of-the-art aqueous amine solutions become feasible. The results provide a mechanistic framework for designing highly efficient adsorbents for removing CO2 from various gas mixtures, and yield insights into the conservation of Mg2+ within the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase family of enzymes. A cooperative insertion mechanism for CO2 adsorption is shown to generate highly efficient adsorbents for carbon capture applications. Advanced solid adsorbents are being investigated as potential agents for efficient gas separation technologies that could help make carbon capture technologies more economical. This paper probes the mechanism of carbon dioxide adsorption of a previously reported diamine-appended metal-organic framework. This material demonstrates unusual and potentially practically useful adsorption properties. The authors find that CO2 adsorbs through insertion into the highly stable metal-amine bonds of the metal-organic framework. As a consequence of the homogenous and perfect spacing of amines, as dictated by the framework's topology, the insertion of a single CO2 molecule induces neighbouring sites to also adsorb CO2 in an unprecedented chain reaction process."
https://openalex.org/W2035016973,"Disruption of the MECP2 gene leads to Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurological disorder with features of autism. MECP2 encodes a methyl-DNA-binding protein that has been proposed to function as a transcriptional repressor, but despite numerous mouse studies examining neuronal gene expression in Mecp2 mutants, no clear model has emerged for how MeCP2 protein regulates transcription. Here we identify a genome-wide length-dependent increase in gene expression in MeCP2 mutant mouse models and human RTT brains. We present evidence that MeCP2 represses gene expression by binding to methylated CA sites within long genes, and that in neurons lacking MeCP2, decreasing the expression of long genes attenuates RTT-associated cellular deficits. In addition, we find that long genes as a population are enriched for neuronal functions and selectively expressed in the brain. These findings suggest that mutations in MeCP2 may cause neurological dysfunction by specifically disrupting long gene expression in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2013637325,"A clinical trial in patients with glioblastoma shows increased immune and anti-tumour responses to dendritic cell vaccination after pre-conditioning the site of vaccination with tetanus toxoid (Td); similar results are also seen in mice in part due to the actions of the chemokine CCL3, and the findings may represent new ways to improve the efficacy of anti-cancer vaccines. John Sampson and colleagues report on a small clinical trial in glioblastoma patients that shows that the immune and anti-tumour response to dendritic cell vaccination is increased by pre-conditioning the site of vaccination with tetanus/diptheria toxoid (Td). Experiments in mice showed similar effects and demonstrated that pre-conditioning with Td enhanced migration of dendritic cells to the tumours, at least in part due to the action of the cytokine CCL3. Although the clinical trial reported is small, these findings may pave the way for new ways of improving the efficacy of anti-cancer vaccines. After stimulation, dendritic cells (DCs) mature and migrate to draining lymph nodes to induce immune responses1. As such, autologous DCs generated ex vivo have been pulsed with tumour antigens and injected back into patients as immunotherapy. While DC vaccines have shown limited promise in the treatment of patients with advanced cancers2,3,4 including glioblastoma5,6,7, the factors dictating DC vaccine efficacy remain poorly understood. Here we show that pre-conditioning the vaccine site with a potent recall antigen such as tetanus/diphtheria (Td) toxoid can significantly improve the lymph node homing and efficacy of tumour-antigen-specific DCs. To assess the effect of vaccine site pre-conditioning in humans, we randomized patients with glioblastoma to pre-conditioning with either mature DCs8 or Td unilaterally before bilateral vaccination with DCs pulsed with Cytomegalovirus phosphoprotein 65 (pp65) RNA. We and other laboratories have shown that pp65 is expressed in more than 90% of glioblastoma specimens but not in surrounding normal brain9,10,11,12, providing an unparalleled opportunity to subvert this viral protein as a tumour-specific target. Patients given Td had enhanced DC migration bilaterally and significantly improved survival. In mice, Td pre-conditioning also enhanced bilateral DC migration and suppressed tumour growth in a manner dependent on the chemokine CCL3. Our clinical studies and corroborating investigations in mice suggest that pre-conditioning with a potent recall antigen may represent a viable strategy to improve anti-tumour immunotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2021242315,"Droplets of mixed water and propylene glycol deposited on clean glass exhibit a contact angle but do not suffer from contact line pinning; their motion can be controlled by the vapour emitted from neighbouring droplets to create a variety of autonomous fluidic machines with integrated sensing and motility capabilities. The ability to control the movement of fluid droplets is of practical use in many applications including microfluidic liquid handling. Existing techniques demand large energy gradients on the solid surfaces on which the droplets are placed or a carefully prepared surface to overcome contact line pinning (an effect which usually limits droplet motion). This paper reports a previously unrecognized phenomenon that could provide a convenient means of manipulating fluid droplets. Droplets consisting of two miscible components in which one component has both a higher vapour pressure and higher surface tension than the other — such as water and propylene glycol — exhibit a contact angle when deposited on a high-energy surface (clean glass), but rest on a fluid film so do not suffer from contact line pinning. The droplets are stabilized by evaporation-induced surface tension gradients and can move under the influence of tiny forces, including the vapour emitted by neighbouring droplets. A wide range of interesting interactions is recorded — for example, one droplet bouncing off another, a droplet 'chasing' another in a circle and a rainbow of different droplets sorted according to their surface tensions. Controlling the wetting behaviour of liquids on surfaces is important for a variety of industrial applications such as water-repellent coatings1 and lubrication2. Liquid behaviour on a surface can range from complete spreading, as in the ‘tears of wine’ effect3,4, to minimal wetting as observed on a superhydrophobic lotus leaf5. Controlling droplet movement is important in microfluidic liquid handling6, on self-cleaning surfaces7 and in heat transfer8. Droplet motion can be achieved by gradients of surface energy9,10,11,12,13. However, existing techniques require either a large gradient or a carefully prepared surface9 to overcome the effects of contact line pinning, which usually limit droplet motion14. Here we show that two-component droplets of well-chosen miscible liquids such as propylene glycol and water deposited on clean glass are not subject to pinning and cause the motion of neighbouring droplets over a distance. Unlike the canonical predictions for these liquids on a high-energy surface, these droplets do not spread completely but exhibit an apparent contact angle. We demonstrate experimentally and analytically that these droplets are stabilized by evaporation-induced surface tension gradients and that they move in response to the vapour emitted by neighbouring droplets. Our fundamental understanding of this robust system enabled us to construct a wide variety of autonomous fluidic machines out of everyday materials."
https://openalex.org/W2066558081,"Rare tautomeric and anionic nucleobases are believed to have fundamental biological roles, but their prevalence and functional importance has remained elusive because they exist transiently, in low abundance, and involve subtle movements of protons that are difficult to visualize. Using NMR relaxation dispersion, we show here that wobble dG•dT and rG•rU mispairs in DNA and RNA duplexes exist in dynamic equilibrium with short-lived, low-populated Watson–Crick-like mispairs that are stabilized by rare enolic or anionic bases. These mispairs can evade Watson–Crick fidelity checkpoints and form with probabilities (10−3 to 10−5) that strongly imply a universal role in replication and translation errors. Our results indicate that rare tautomeric and anionic bases are widespread in nucleic acids, expanding their structural and functional complexity beyond that attainable with canonical bases. dG•dT and rG•rU ‘wobble’ mispairs in DNA and RNA transiently form base pairs with Watson–Crick geometry via tautomerization and ionization with probabilities that correlate with misincorporation probabilities during replication and translation. The conventional, hydrogen-bonded view of DNA is a static representation that does not reflect the actual dynamics of this molecule. In fact, DNA is constantly sampling transient alterations in the nucleobases that have been difficult to quantify and visualize. Hashim Al-Hashimi and colleagues have used NMR to characterize these fleeting forms. Their data indicate that such forms are present at levels that are high enough to influence the fidelity of replication and translation. Specifically, they find that noncanonical dG·T and rG·U 'wobble' mispairs in DNA and RNA duplexes morph transiently into canonical Watson–Crick-like mispairs that are stabilized by rare enol tautomeric and anionic bases."

https://openalex.org/W2005576578,"Purpose Up to 50% of patients with uveal melanoma (UM) develop metastatic disease with limited treatment options. The immunomodulating agent ipilimumab has shown an overall survival (OS) benefit in patients with cutaneous metastatic melanoma in two phase III trials. As patients with UM were excluded in these studies, the Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group (DeCOG) conducted a phase II to assess the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab in patients with metastatic UM. Patients and Methods We undertook a multicenter phase II study in patients with different subtypes of metastatic melanoma. Here we present data on patients with metastatic UM (pretreated and treatment-naïve) who received up to four cycles of ipilimumab administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg in 3 week intervals. Tumor assessments were conducted at baseline, weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48 according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Adverse events (AEs), including immune-related AEs were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) v.4.0. Primary endpoint was the OS rate at 12 months. Results Forty five pretreated (85%) and eight treatment-naïve (15%) patients received at least one dose of ipilimumab. 1-year and 2-year OS rates were 22% and 7%, respectively. Median OS was 6.8 months (95% CI 3.7–8.1), median progression-free survival 2.8 months (95% CI 2.5–2.9). The disease control rate at weeks 12 and 24 was 47% and 21%, respectively. Sixteen patients had stable disease (47%), none experienced partial or complete response. Treatment-related AEs were observed in 35 patients (66%), including 19 grade 3–4 events (36%). One drug-related death due to pancytopenia was observed. Conclusions Ipilimumab has very limited clinical activity in patients with metastatic UM. Toxicity was manageable when treated as per protocol-specific guidelines. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01355120"

https://openalex.org/W2045178475,"Initiation of cellular DNA replication is tightly controlled to sustain genomic integrity. In eukaryotes, the heterohexameric origin recognition complex (ORC) is essential for coordinating replication onset. Here we describe the crystal structure of Drosophila ORC at 3.5 Å resolution, showing that the 270 kilodalton initiator core complex comprises a two-layered notched ring in which a collar of winged-helix domains from the Orc1-5 subunits sits atop a layer of AAA+ (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) folds. Although canonical inter-AAA+ domain interactions exist between four of the six ORC subunits, unanticipated features are also evident. These include highly interdigitated domain-swapping interactions between the winged-helix folds and AAA+ modules of neighbouring protomers, and a quasi-spiral arrangement of DNA binding elements that circumnavigate an approximately 20 Å wide channel in the centre of the complex. Comparative analyses indicate that ORC encircles DNA, using its winged-helix domain face to engage the mini-chromosome maintenance 2-7 (MCM2-7) complex during replicative helicase loading; however, an observed out-of-plane rotation of more than 90° for the Orc1 AAA+ domain disrupts interactions with catalytic amino acids in Orc4, narrowing and sealing off entry into the central channel. Prima facie, our data indicate that Drosophila ORC can switch between active and autoinhibited conformations, suggesting a novel means for cell cycle and/or developmental control of ORC functions."
https://openalex.org/W1982542795,"Inhibition of signal transduction downstream of the IL-23 receptor represents an intriguing approach to the treatment of autoimmunity. Using a chemogenomics approach marrying kinome-wide inhibitory profiles of a compound library with the cellular activity against an IL-23-stimulated transcriptional response in T lymphocytes, a class of inhibitors was identified that bind to and stabilize the pseudokinase domain of the Janus kinase tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2), resulting in blockade of receptor-mediated activation of the adjacent catalytic domain. These Tyk2 pseudokinase domain stabilizers were also shown to inhibit Tyk2-dependent signaling through the Type I interferon receptor but not Tyk2-independent signaling and transcriptional cellular assays, including stimulation through the receptors for IL-2 (JAK1- and JAK3-dependent) and thrombopoietin (JAK2-dependent), demonstrating the high functional selectivity of this approach. A crystal structure of the pseudokinase domain liganded with a representative example showed the compound bound to a site analogous to the ATP-binding site in catalytic kinases with features consistent with high ligand selectivity. The results support a model where the pseudokinase domain regulates activation of the catalytic domain by forming receptor-regulated inhibitory interactions. Tyk2 pseudokinase stabilizers, therefore, represent a novel approach to the design of potent and selective agents for the treatment of autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2138448378,"We investigated two important means for improving source reconstruction in presurgical epilepsy diagnosis. The first investigation is about the optimal choice of the number of epileptic spikes in averaging to (1) sufficiently reduce the noise bias for an accurate determination of the center of gravity of the epileptic activity and (2) still get an estimation of the extent of the irritative zone. The second study focuses on the differences in single modality EEG (80-electrodes) or MEG (275-gradiometers) and especially on the benefits of combined EEG/MEG (EMEG) source analysis. Both investigations were validated with simultaneous stereo-EEG (sEEG) (167-contacts) and low-density EEG (ldEEG) (21-electrodes). To account for the different sensitivity profiles of EEG and MEG, we constructed a six-compartment finite element head model with anisotropic white matter conductivity, and calibrated the skull conductivity via somatosensory evoked responses. Our results show that, unlike single modality EEG or MEG, combined EMEG uses the complementary information of both modalities and thereby allows accurate source reconstructions also at early instants in time (epileptic spike onset), i.e., time points with low SNR, which are not yet subject to propagation and thus supposed to be closer to the origin of the epileptic activity. EMEG is furthermore able to reveal the propagation pathway at later time points in agreement with sEEG, while EEG or MEG alone reconstructed only parts of it. Subaveraging provides important and accurate information about both the center of gravity and the extent of the epileptogenic tissue that neither single nor grand-averaged spike localizations can supply."
https://openalex.org/W2083483385,"Despite the ever-increasing number of patients with dementia worldwide, fundamental therapeutic approaches to this condition have not been established. Epidemiological studies suggest that intake of fermented dairy products prevents cognitive decline in the elderly. However, the active compounds responsible for the effect remain to be elucidated. The present study aims to elucidate the preventive effects of dairy products on Alzheimer’s disease and to identify the responsible component. Here, in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (5xFAD), intake of a dairy product fermented with Penicillium candidum had preventive effects on the disease by reducing the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) and hippocampal inflammation (TNF-α and MIP-1α production), and enhancing hippocampal neurotrophic factors (BDNF and GDNF). A search for preventive substances in the fermented dairy product identified oleamide as a novel dual-active component that enhanced microglial Aβ phagocytosis and anti-inflammatory activity towards LPS stimulation in vitro and in vivo. During the fermentation, oleamide was synthesized from oleic acid, which is an abundant component of general dairy products owing to lipase enzymatic amidation. The present study has demonstrated the preventive effect of dairy products on Alzheimer’s disease, which was previously reported only epidemiologically. Moreover, oleamide has been identified as an active component of dairy products that is considered to reduce Aβ accumulation via enhanced microglial phagocytosis, and to suppress microglial inflammation after Aβ deposition. Because fermented dairy products such as camembert cheese are easy to ingest safely as a daily meal, their consumption might represent a preventive strategy for dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2103728693,"Many studies of aging examine biomarkers one at a time, but complex systems theory and network theory suggest that interpretations of individual markers may be context-dependent. Here, we attempted to detect underlying processes governing the levels of many biomarkers simultaneously by applying principal components analysis to 43 common clinical biomarkers measured longitudinally in 3694 humans from three longitudinal cohort studies on two continents (Women's Health and Aging I & II, InCHIANTI, and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging). The first axis was associated with anemia, inflammation, and low levels of calcium and albumin. The axis structure was precisely reproduced in all three populations and in all demographic sub-populations (by sex, race, etc.); we call the process represented by the axis ""integrated albunemia."" Integrated albunemia increases and accelerates with age in all populations, and predicts mortality and frailty--but not chronic disease--even after controlling for age. This suggests a role in the aging process, though causality is not yet clear. Integrated albunemia behaves more stably across populations than its component biomarkers, and thus appears to represent a higher-order physiological process emerging from the structure of underlying regulatory networks. If this is correct, detection of this process has substantial implications for physiological organization more generally."
https://openalex.org/W2034274339,"Background Shift work is indicated to be associated with adverse metabolic disorders. However, potential effects of shift work on metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components have not been well established. Methods In total, 26,382 workers from Dongfeng-Tongji Cohort were included in this study. Information on shift work history was gathered through questionnaires and metabolic traits were measured. Logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for long-term shift work related with MetS and each component, respectively. Further stratification analysis was performed to detect the differences on MetS between female and male shift workers. Results Long-term shift work was associated with MetS without adjusting for any confounders. Compared with the group of non-shift work, the multivariate-adjusted ORs (95%CI) of MetS associated with 1–10, 11−20, and ≥20y of shift work were 1.05 (0.95−1.16), 1.14 (1.03−1.26), 1.16 (1.01−1.31), respectively. In female workers, we found a dose-response relationship that every 10 years increase in shift work was associated with a 10% (95% CI: 1%−20%) elevated OR of MetS, while no significant dose-response trend was found among male workers. Furthermore, shift work duration was significantly associated with ORs of high blood pressure (1.07, 1.01−1.13), long waist circumference (1.10, 1.01−1.20) and high glucose levels (1.09, 1.04−1.15). No significant association was observed between shift work and low HDL cholesterol) and raised triglyceride levels. Conclusions Long-term shift work was associated with metabolic syndrome and the association might differ by gender in retired workers. Applicable intervention strategies are needed for prevention of metabolic disorders for shift workers."
https://openalex.org/W2094058775,"Objective Astaxanthin, a potent antioxidant, exhibits a wide range of biological activities, including antioxidant, atherosclerosis and antitumor activities. However, its effect on concanavalin A (ConA)-induced autoimmune hepatitis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of astaxanthin on ConA-induced hepatitis in mice, and to elucidate the mechanisms of regulation. Materials and Methods Autoimmune hepatitis was induced in in Balb/C mice using ConA (25 mg/kg), and astaxanthin was orally administered daily at two doses (20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg) for 14 days before ConA injection. Levels of serum liver enzymes and the histopathology of inflammatory cytokines and other maker proteins were determined at three time points (2, 8 and 24 h). Primary hepatocytes were pretreated with astaxanthin (80 μM) in vitro 24 h before stimulation with TNF-α (10 ng/ml). The apoptosis rate and related protein expression were determined 24 h after the administration of TNF-α. Results Astaxanthin attenuated serum liver enzymes and pathological damage by reducing the release of inflammatory factors. It performed anti-apoptotic effects via the descending phosphorylation of Bcl-2 through the down-regulation of the JNK/p-JNK pathway. Conclusion This research firstly expounded that astaxanthin reduced immune liver injury in ConA-induced autoimmune hepatitis. The mode of action appears to be downregulation of JNK/p-JNK-mediated apoptosis and autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W1976342639,"Humans have had a major impact on the environment. This has been particularly intense in the last millennium but has been noticeable since the development of food production and the associated higher population densities in the last 10,000 years. The use of fire and over-exploitation of large mammals has also been recognized as having an effect on the world’s ecology, going back perhaps 100,000 years or more. Here we report on an earlier anthropogenic environmental change. The use of stone tools, which dates back over 2.5 million years, and the subsequent evolution of a technologically-dependent lineage required the exploitation of very large quantities of rock. However, measures of the impact of hominin stone exploitation are rare and inherently difficult. The Messak Settafet, a sandstone massif in the Central Sahara (Libya), is littered with Pleistocene stone tools on an unprecedented scale and is, in effect, a man-made landscape. Surveys showed that parts of the Messak Settafet have as much as 75 lithics per square metre and that this fractured debris is a dominant element of the environment. The type of stone tools—Acheulean and Middle Stone Age—indicates that extensive stone tool manufacture occurred over the last half million years or more. The lithic-strewn pavement created by this ancient stone tool manufacture possibly represents the earliest human environmental impact at a landscape scale and is an example of anthropogenic change. The nature of the lithics and inferred age may suggest that hominins other than modern humans were capable of unintentionally modifying their environment. The scale of debris also indicates the significance of stone as a critical resource for hominins and so provides insights into a novel evolutionary ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2079911707,"Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) has recently emerged as a central regulator of innate immunity and inflammation in response to both sterile inflammatory and microbial invasion signals. Although its ability to drive proteolytic procaspase-1 processing has drawn more attention, NLPR3 can also activate NF-κB. To clarify the physiological relevance of this latter function, we examined the effect of NLRP3 on NF-κB activation and cytokine induction in RNA-interference-based NLRP3-knockdown cell lines generated from the human monocytic cell line THP-1. Knocking down NLRP3 reduced NF-κB activation and cytokine induction in the early stages of Staphylococcus aureus infection. Expression of cytokine genes induced by Staphylococcus aureus was not inhibited by a caspase-1 inhibitor, and did not occur through an autocrine mechanism in response to newly synthesized cytokines. We also demonstrated that NLRP3 could activate NF-κB and induce cytokines in response to sterile signals, monosodium urate crystals and aluminum adjuvant. Thus, NLRP3 mediates NF-κB activation in both sterile and microbially induced inflammation. Our findings show that not only does NLRP3 activate caspase-1 post-translationally, but it also induces multiple cytokine genes in the innate immune system."

https://openalex.org/W1967447913,"The purpose of the present work was to progress in our understanding of the pathophysiology of L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, due to a defect in L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, by creating and studying a mouse model of this disease. L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase-deficient mice (l2hgdh-/-) accumulated L-2-hydroxyglutarate in tissues, most particularly in brain and testis, where the concentration reached ≈ 3.5 μmol/g. Male mice showed a 30% higher excretion of L-2-hydroxyglutarate compared to female mice, supporting that this dicarboxylic acid is partially made in males by lactate dehydrogenase C, a poorly specific form of this enzyme exclusively expressed in testes. Involvement of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase in the formation of L-2-hydroxyglutarate was supported by the commensurate decrease in the formation of this dicarboxylic acid when down-regulating this enzyme in mouse l2hgdh-/- embryonic fibroblasts. The concentration of lysine and arginine was markedly increased in the brain of l2hgdh-/- adult mice. Saccharopine was depleted and glutamine was decreased by ≈ 40%. Lysine-α-ketoglutarate reductase, which converts lysine to saccharopine, was inhibited by L-2-hydroxyglutarate with a Ki of ≈ 0.8 mM. As low but significant activities of the bifunctional enzyme lysine-α-ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase were found in brain, these findings suggest that the classical lysine degradation pathway also operates in brain and is inhibited by the high concentrations of L-2-hydroxyglutarate found in l2hgdh-/- mice. Pathological analysis of the brain showed significant spongiosis. The vacuolar lesions mostly affected oligodendrocytes and myelin sheats, as in other dicarboxylic acidurias, suggesting that the pathophysiology of this model of leukodystrophy may involve irreversible pumping of a dicarboxylate in oligodendrocytes. Neurobehavioral testing indicated that the mice mostly suffered from a deficit in learning capacity. In conclusion, the findings support the concept that L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is a disorder of metabolite repair. The accumulation of L-2-hydroxyglutarate exerts toxic effects through various means including enzyme inhibition and glial cell swelling."

Eight assemblages, designated A–H, are described for this species. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated by microscopy or by direct immunofluorescence technique the occurrence of G. duodenalis in 380 humans, 34 animals, 44 samples of water and 11 of vegetables. G. duodenalis cysts present in samples were genotyped through PCR-RFLP of β giardin and glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) genes and sequencing of gdh. The gdh gene was amplified in 76.5% (26/34) of the human faeces samples with positive microscopy and in 2.9% (1/34) of negative samples. In 70.4% (19/27) of the positive samples were found BIV assemblage. In two samples from dogs with positive microscopy and one negative sample, assemblages BIV, C, and D were found. Cysts of Giardia were not detected in water samples, but three samples used for vegetable irrigation showed total coliforms above the allowed limit, and Escherichia coli was observed in one sample. G. duodenalis BIV was detected in two samples of Lactuca sativa irrigated with this sample of water. BIV was a common genotype, with 100% similarity, between different sources or hosts (humans, animals and vegetables), and the one most often found in humans. Conclusions/Significance This is the first study in Brazil that reports the connection among humans, dogs and vegetables in the transmission dynamics of G. duodenalis in the same geographic area finding identical assemblage. BIV assemblage was the most frequently observed among these different links in the epidemiological chain."

The model was formulated to study the system-level consequences of interactions among the following proteins: two key components of MTOR complex 1 (MTORC1), namely the protein kinase MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) and the scaffold protein RPTOR; the autophagy-initiating protein kinase ULK1; and the multimeric energy-sensing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Inputs of the model include intrinsic AMPK kinase activity, which is taken as an adjustable surrogate parameter for cellular energy level or AMP:ATP ratio, and rapamycin dose, which controls MTORC1 activity. Outputs of the model include the phosphorylation level of the translational repressor EIF4EBP1, a substrate of MTORC1, and the phosphorylation level of AMBRA1 (activating molecule in BECN1-regulated autophagy), a substrate of ULK1 critical for autophagosome formation. The model incorporates reciprocal regulation of mTORC1 and ULK1 by AMPK, mutual inhibition of MTORC1 and ULK1, and ULK1-mediated negative feedback regulation of AMPK. Through analysis of the model, we find that these processes may be responsible, depending on conditions, for graded responses to stress inputs, for bistable switching between autophagy and protein synthesis, or relaxation oscillations, comprising alternating periods of autophagy and protein synthesis. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the prediction of oscillatory behavior is robust to changes of the parameter values of the model. The model provides testable predictions about the behavior of the AMPK-MTORC1-ULK1 network, which plays a central role in maintaining cellular energy and nutrient homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2085142877,"Huntington’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by toxic insertions of polyglutamine residues in the Huntingtin protein and characterized by progressive deterioration of cognitive and motor functions. Altered brain glucose metabolism has long been suggested and a possible link has been proposed in HD. However, the precise function of glucose transporters was not yet determined. Here, we report the effects of the specifically-neuronal human glucose transporter expression in neurons of a Drosophila model carrying the exon 1 of the human huntingtin gene with 93 glutamine repeats (HQ93). We demonstrated that overexpression of the human glucose transporter in neurons ameliorated significantly the status of HD flies by increasing their lifespan, reducing their locomotor deficits and rescuing eye neurodegeneration. Then, we investigated whether increasing the major pathways of glucose catabolism, glycolysis and pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) impacts HD. To mimic increased glycolytic flux, we overexpressed phosphofructokinase (PFK) which catalyzes an irreversible step in glycolysis. Overexpression of PFK did not affect HQ93 fly survival, but protected from photoreceptor loss. Overexpression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the key enzyme of the PPP, extended significantly the lifespan of HD flies and rescued eye neurodegeneration. Since G6PD is able to synthesize NADPH involved in cell survival by maintenance of the redox state, we showed that tolerance to experimental oxidative stress was enhanced in flies co-expressing HQ93 and G6PD. Additionally overexpressions of hGluT3, G6PD or PFK were able to circumvent mitochondrial deficits induced by specific silencing of genes necessary for mitochondrial homeostasis. Our study confirms the involvement of bioenergetic deficits in HD course; they can be rescued by specific expression of a glucose transporter in neurons. Finally, the PPP and, to a lesser extent, the glycolysis seem to mediate the hGluT3 protective effects, whereas, in addition, the PPP provides increased protection to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2012249786,"Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) is a dual substrate PDE that can hydrolyze both cGMP and cAMP. In brain, PDE10A is almost exclusively expressed in the striatum. In several studies, PDE10A has been implicated in regulation of striatal output using either specific inhibitors or PDE10A knock-out mice and has been suggested as a promising target for novel antipsychotic drugs. In striatal medium spiny neurons, PDE10A is localized at the plasma membrane and in dendritic spines close to postsynaptic densities. In the present study, we identify PDE10A as the major cAMP PDE in mouse striatum and monitor PKA-dependent PDE10A phosphorylation. With recombinantly expressed PDE10A we demonstrate that phosphorylation does not alter PDE10A activity. In striatum, PDE10A was found to be associated with the A kinase anchoring protein AKAP150 suggesting the existence of a multiprotein signaling complex localizing PDE10A to a specific functional context at synaptic membranes. Furthermore, the cAMP effector PKA, the NMDA receptor subunits NR2A and -B, as well as PSD95, were tethered to the complex.

To date, 11 families of phosphodiesterases (PDE1 to PDE11) 2The abbreviations used are: PDEphosphodiesteraseAKAPA-kinase anchor proteinMP-102-[4-(1-methyl-4-pyridin-4-yl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-phenoxymethyl]-quinolinePP2Aprotein phosphatase 2A. have been identified that are differentially expressed in mammalian tissues and cells (1.Bender A.T.

These neurons represent ∼95% of striatal neurons and integrate cortical glutamatergic input and midbrain dopaminergic signaling. They form the major input station for the basal ganglia that are involved in planning and modulation of movement pathways and a variety of other cognitive processes. Dysfunction of striatal circuitry is implicated in the pathophysiology of many brain disorders such as Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, schizophrenia, and substance abuse (13.Kapur S.

The high expression of PDE10A in medium spiny neurons suggests an important role in modulation of striatal function through cAMP degradation and termination of cAMP/PKA signaling. Consequently, enhancement of cAMP signaling through PDE10A knock-out or pharmacological inhibition of PDE10A has been shown to affect locomotor activity and acquisition of conditioned avoidance (16.Siuciak J.A.

Here, we describe PDE10A as the major cAMP PDE in striatum. Interaction of PDE10A with a postsynaptic signaling complex is demonstrated by coprecipitation of PDE10 with the scaffold protein AKAP150, PKA as well as PSD95 and NMDA receptor subunits. Such a complex might put PDE10A into the position of a “gate keeper” that limits cAMP accumulation at postsynaptic sites, prevents spreading of synaptic signals into the cell body, and ensures precisely timed phosphorylation and thereby regulation of NMDA receptors. We demonstrate PKA-dependent phosphorylation of PDE10A in striatal slices and identify protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as the responsible phosphatase. Moreover, phosphorylation of PDE10A2 does not alter enzymatic properties but releases PDE10A from the identified signaling complex. All experiments were performed using 3-month-old male mice of the C57BL/6 strain. After sacrificing the animals, the brain was quickly removed and the striata from the left and right hemisphere were isolated in less than 2 min. The striata of two mice were immediately homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dl-dithiothreitol, 50 mm triethanolamine/hydrochloride, pH 7.4, containing the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.4 mm), benzamidine (0.2 mm), and pepstatin A (1 μm)) using a glass-glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The lysate was cleared from nuclei and cellular debris by centrifugation at 800 × g (10 min, 4 °C) and then recentrifuged at 125,000 × g (40 min, 4 °C) to obtain the cytosolic fraction. Membranes were resuspended in the original volume of lysis buffer. Equal volumes of all fractions (corresponding to 20 μg of protein in the homogenate) were applied to SDS-PAGE. Synaptosomal cytosol and membranes were prepared as described (20.Russwurm M. Wittau N. Koesling D. Guanylyl cyclase/PSD-95 interaction: targeting of the nitric oxide-sensitive α2β1 guanylyl cyclase to synaptic membranes.J. Biol.

HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Mouse PDE10A2 was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 zeo+ vector via NheI/NotI sites and 8 μg of vector/75 cm2 bottle were transfected into HEK293 cells using the FuGENE6 protocol (Promega). Transfected cells were harvested 48–72 h post-transfection, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer, and lysed by sonication (two 5-s pulses). Cellular debris was eliminated by centrifugation (800 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The lysate was split for comparative analysis of phosphorylated versus non-phosphorylated PDE10A2 and preincubated for 10 min with 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 μm okadaic acid and PhosSTOP (Roche Applied Science) in lysis buffer. In vitro phosphorylation was performed by addition of the catalytic subunit of PKA (0.5 μg, Jena Bioscience) for 30 min at 37 °C. For non-phospho control, ATP and PKA were omitted. PDE10A2-expressing HEK293 cells were homogenized in cell extraction buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm triethanolamine/hydrochloride, pH 7.4, containing 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm benzamidine, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μm okadaic acid) by 15 strokes with a glass-glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The cell extract was diluted with PKA buffer (0.5 mm ATP, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml of BSA, 2 mm dl-dithiothreitol, 50 mm triethanolamine/hydrochloride, pH 7.4, final concentrations) and incubated with or without 0.5 μg (800 units) of PKA (Jena Biosciences, PR-318) for 30 min at 37 °C. An aliquot of the phosphorylated sample was saved for Western blot before purification of pPDE10 using the Pierce phosphoprotein enrichment kit (Thermo Scientific) following the suppliers instructions as follows. The sample was diluted 10-fold with the supplied lysis/binding/wash buffer containing CHAPS (0.25%) and then incubated with the column for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Flow-through was discarded and the phosphorylated protein was eluted with 1 ml of supplied elution buffer without CHAPS. All samples were applied to a 9% SDS gel. For detection, PDE10 antibody (6.Jäger R. Russwurm C. Schwede F. Genieser H.-G. Koesling D. Russwurm M. Activation of PDE10 and PDE11 phosphodiesterases.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 1210-1219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and pPDE10 antibody were used. The pPDE10 antibody was generated against phosphorylated amino acids 11–20 of PDE10A2 in rabbits and purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (PSL, Heidelberg, Germany). PDE activity was measured by the conversion of [32P]cyclic nucleotide monophosphate into [32P]nucleotide monophosphate as described previously (21.Jäger R. Schwede F. Genieser H.-G. Koesling D. Russwurm M. Activation of PDE2 and PDE5 by specific GAF ligands: delayed activation of PDE5.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2010; 161: 1645-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 0.1 μl of the striatal or HEK cell homogenates. Substrate concentrations were 0.03 to 1 μm cAMP or 1 μm cGMP, as indicated. Data are mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicates. PDE10A2 activation by the GAF domain ligand 7-CH-cAMP (Biolog) was determined at a substrate concentration of 0.03 μm cAMP. To determine the dissociation rate of cAMP from the PDE10A2 GAF domain, PDE10A2 was preincubated with 3 mm MgCl2 and 10 μm cAMP for 2 min at 37 °C. PDE10A2 was then diluted 100-fold and PDE activity was determined at various time points between 0 and 32 min. Three-month-old male mice were killed, and brains were removed and placed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit (KH) buffer containing the following: 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.55 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 27.8 mm d-glucose equilibrated to pH 7.4 by aeration with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Brain slices (coronal, 300 μm thick) were cut using a Vibroslice (NVSLM1, World Precision Instruments). The striatum was isolated and immediately transferred to a nylon net submerged in KH buffer, kept at pH 7.4 by aeration as described above (room temperature). After 1 h of recovery, slices were transferred to incubation chambers containing 10 ml of KH, kept at 37 °C, and equilibrated for a further 30 min. Slices were preincubated with PDE and phosphatase inhibitors for 10 min as indicated, transferred to new incubation chambers containing NMDA with or without phosphatase inhibitors as indicated for an additional 5 min. Slices were instantly frozen in liquid nitrogen. For immunodetection, single slices were homogenized in 240 μl of lysis buffer as described above. SDS-PAGE sample buffer (60 μl, ×4) was immediately added and 20 μl of each sample was applied to electrophoresis. The striata of two mice were homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors as above) using a glass-glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 800 × g (10 min, 4 °C) and added to Dynabeads Protein A (Invitrogen) that were loaded with ∼50 μg of anti-PDE10A antibody (6.Jäger R. Russwurm C. Schwede F. Genieser H.-G. Koesling D. Russwurm M. Activation of PDE10 and PDE11 phosphodiesterases.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 1210-1219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) per 10 mg of beads. Incubation was for 1 h at 4 °C in the absence or presence of the purified antigen (500 μg). Unspecifically bound proteins were removed by three washes with PBS and precipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer (30 μl/mg of Dynabeads) and loaded to SDS gels (15–20 μl per lane). One-tenth of the striatal lysate was applied for input loading. For immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated PDE10, striatal slices from 2 mice were prepared. Phosphorylation was induced by incubation of the slices with papaverine (100 μm) and forskolin (10 μm) for 10 min in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (0.5 μm okadaic acid, 5 μm cyclosporin A, 0.2 μm calyculin A). Slices were pooled and instantly homogenized in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer (as above, but additionally containing phosphatase inhibitors) before precipitation by PDE10 antibody coupled to Dynabeads (see above). AKAP150 and the NMDA receptor subunit NR2A were precipitated from striata of 2 mice as described above using 10 μg of antibodies (AKAP150 sc-6445; NMDAϵ1 sc-1468, Santa Cruz) per 10 mg of beads. After washing, 55 μg of Dynabeads with bound proteins/sample were used in PDE assays. Measurements were performed in duplicates. Data represent mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA-85, Schleicher & Schuell) using standard procedures. After blocking (Roti-Block; Carl Roth), proteins were detected using the following antibodies: PDE10A, AKAP150, and NMDAϵ1 (see above), NMDAϵ2 (sc-1469, Santa Cruz), PP2B (sc-6123, Santa Cruz), and PSD95 (MA1–046, Thermo Scientific). Anti-pPDE10A was generated in rabbits against the phosphorylated N-terminal peptide (amino acids 11–20). Purification of the antiserum was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (PSL, Heidelberg, Germany). Secondary peroxidase-labeled anti-goat, anti-rabbit, and anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Sigma. Detection was performed with SuperSignal West Dura chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and a CCD camera (GDS 8000; UVP). Optical densities of Western signals were measured using the LabWorks 4.0 software (UVP). For quantification of PDE10 phosphorylation, pPDE10A and PDE10A in the same sample were measured, normalized to mean intensity of specific bands on a membrane to account for intensity variation of different blots, and expressed as pPDE/PDE ratio. Dynabeads (5 mg) with precipitated proteins were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in PKA buffer (10 μm cAMP, 0.5 mm ATP, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 2 mm dl-dithiothreitol, 50 mm triethanolamine/hydrochloride, pH 7.4) containing 1 μm MP-10 and PhosSTOP. In the negative control, cAMP and ATP were omitted. Incubation was for 10 min at 37 °C. Dynabeads were washed and proteins were eluted with 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. Volumes corresponding to 0.75 mg of Dynabeads were applied per lane of a 9% SDS gel. For gel filtration chromatography, the striata of 5 male mice were homogenized in Nonidet P-40 buffer (see above) and centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g (4 °C). The resulting supernatant was applied to a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200pg column. The column was run with 0.68 column volumes of the Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Separation of proteins was followed by online detection of absorption at 280 nm. Fractions of 1.25 ml were collected and protein containing fractions were screened for PDE activity in the absence and presence of MP-10 (0.1 μm). For calibration, thyroglobulin (660 kDa), immunoglobulin G (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and ovalbumin (43 kDa) were separated on the same column and molecular weights were calculated using semi-logarithmic regression. Statistical testing was performed in Excel using Student's t test or Holm-Bonferroni's test (multiple comparisons of PDE activities with PDE inhibitors). For multiple comparisons of PDE10A phosphorylation, data were log transformed, homoscedasticity was checked by Levene's test, and data were further analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparisons post hoc tests using IBM SPSS 22. Differences are reported as significant at p < 0.05. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. (error bars). Phosphodiesterases are critical regulators of cyclic nucleotide signaling in brain.

Here, we set out to determine the relative contribution of the dual substrate PDE10A for cyclic nucleotide turnover in striatum. To this end, we measured cAMP and cGMP hydrolytic activity in striatal homogenates from mouse in the absence and presence of various PDE inhibitors at substrate concentrations of 0.1 μm cAMP (Fig. 1A) or 1 μm cGMP (Fig. 1B). Inhibition of PDEs 3, 4, 5, 9, or 11 did not affect cAMP or cGMP hydrolysis. Inhibition of PDE1 (50 μm vinpocetine) or PDE2 (0.2 μm Bay 60-7550) reduced the overall cAMP degradation by ∼10% each. The greatest effect on cAMP hydrolysis was observed in the presence of two different PDE10 inhibitors: papaverine (10 μm) inhibited ∼70%, and the more specific MP-10 (0.01 μm) inhibited ∼60% of cAMP hydrolysis (Fig. 1A). In the following, papaverine was used in some experiments because of the limited availability of MP-10. For cGMP turnover, PDEs 1 and 2 are most important as inhibition of these PDEs resulted in a ∼35 and ∼20% reduction of cGMP degradation, respectively. Although PDE10A is considered a dual specific PDE, its inhibition by papaverine only resulted in a slight reduction of cGMP-degrading activity in striatum (Fig. 1B). Thus, we conclude that PDE10A acts as the major cAMP PDE in striatum at the substrate concentration tested and controls most of the cAMP/PKA signal transduction in medium spiny neurons. Next we analyzed subcellular localization of PDE10A in mouse striatum. To assess compartmental localization, mice striata were separated into a cytosolic and a membrane fraction. Adequate fractionation was ensured by analysis of cytosolic and membrane marker proteins GAPDH and PSD95, respectively. As shown by Western immunodetection, PDE10A was enriched in the membrane fraction approximately ∼3-fold compared with the cytosolic fraction. These results are in accordance with several previous reports (10.Xie Z. Adamowicz W.O. Eldred W.D. Jakowski A.B. Kleiman R.J. Morton D.G. Stephenson D.T. Strick C.A. Williams R.D. Menniti F.S.

As shown in Fig. 1C, PDE10A distribution in the synaptosomal cytosol and membranes mirrored the distribution in total striatum. We therefore conclude that PDE10A is present in striatal synapses. PDE10A has been shown to be phosphorylated at Thr-16 by PKA in vitro and in heterologous expression systems (26.Kotera J. Fujishige K. Yuasa K. Omori K.

To examine PDE10A2 phosphorylation in mouse striatum, we generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognize phosphorylated PDE10A2. This antibody reacted strongly with heterologously expressed PDE10A2 only after in vitro phosphorylation by PKA catalytic subunit (Fig. 2). In vivo phosphorylation of PDE10A2 was analyzed in mouse striatal slices. In lysate of untreated slices, phosphorylation of PDE10A2 was undetectable (Figs. 3A and 4, A and B, first lane). However, treatment with the adenylyl cyclase stimulator forskolin or the PDE10 inhibitors papaverine or MP-10 to raise intracellular cAMP and consecutively stimulate PKA led to a robust approximately 3–4-fold increase in phosphorylation (Figs. 3A and 4, A and B, respectively). This effect was enhanced by the simultaneous application of the PP2A/PP1 inhibitor okadaic acid (1 μm, Fig. 4A, third lane) 3The bands in the second and third lanes display similar density on the representative blot shown, which has been selected because it is representative for the other statistically significant differences. but not by cyclosporin A, a protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) inhibitor (Fig. 4B, third lane).FIGURE 4PDE10A phosphorylation is reversed by PP2A/PP1 inhibition.

Design, Setting and Participants 2,308 adult volunteers from the TwinsUK Registry (www.twinsuk.ac.uk) completed an online survey about their views on the consent process for use of their DNA and medical information in research. Their views on the re-consenting process in different scenarios were assessed. Results The majority of volunteers preferred to be informed of the identity of the main researcher of a study in which they are participating, which is contrary to current practice. Over 80% were willing to complete the consent process online instead of face to face. On the whole, respondents did not view their DNA differently from their medical information with regard to the consent process. Research participants were more willing to give broad consent to cover future research if their DNA was to be used by the original researcher than by another researcher, even if the disease under investigation varied, in contrast to the traditional ‘gold standard’ whereby specific consent is required for all new research projects. Discussion In some scenarios, research participants reported that they would be comfortable with not signing a new consent form for future research uses of their data and DNA, and are comfortable with secure, online consent processes rather than traditional face-to-face consent processes. Our findings indicate that the perceived relationship between research participants and researchers plays an important role in shaping preferences regarding the consent process and suggest that this relationship is not captured by traditional consent processes. We argue that the development of new formats of consent should be informed by empirical research on volunteers’ perceptions and preferences regarding the consent process."
https://openalex.org/W2151265643,"Uptake of system L amino acid substrates into isolated placental plasma membrane vesicles in the absence of opposing side amino acid (zero-trans uptake) is incompatible with the concept of obligatory exchange, where influx of amino acid is coupled to efflux. We therefore hypothesized that system L amino acid exchange transporters are not fully obligatory and/or that amino acids are initially present inside the vesicles. To address this, we combined computational modeling with vesicle transport assays and transporter localization studies to investigate the mechanisms mediating [(14)C]L-serine (a system L substrate) transport into human placental microvillous plasma membrane (MVM) vesicles. The carrier model provided a quantitative framework to test the 2 hypotheses that l-serine transport occurs by either obligate exchange or nonobligate exchange coupled with facilitated transport (mixed transport model). The computational model could only account for experimental [(14)C]L-serine uptake data when the transporter was not exclusively in exchange mode, best described by the mixed transport model. MVM vesicle isolates contained endogenous amino acids allowing for potential contribution to zero-trans uptake. Both L-type amino acid transporter (LAT)1 and LAT2 subtypes of system L were distributed to MVM, with L-serine transport attributed to LAT2. These findings suggest that exchange transporters do not function exclusively as obligate exchangers."

The mechanism of how these drugs alter fluid secretion in the gut and induce diarrhea is not clearly understood. Several drugs are either substrates or inhibitors of multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4), such as the anti-colon cancer drug irinotecan and an anti-retroviral used to treat HIV infection, 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT). These drugs activate cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-mediated fluid secretion by inhibiting MRP4-mediated cAMP efflux. Binding of drugs to MRP4 augments the formation of MRP4-CFTR-containing macromolecular complexes that is mediated via scaffolding protein PDZK1. Importantly, HIV patients on AZT treatment demonstrate augmented MRP4-CFTR complex formation in the colon, which defines a novel paradigm of drug-induced diarrhea."
https://openalex.org/W1967186290,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sae2 and its ortholog CtIP in higher eukaryotes have a conserved role in the initial processing of DNA lesions and influencing their subsequent repair pathways. Sae2 is phosphorylated by the ATR/ATM family kinases Mec1 and Tel1 in response to DNA damage. Among the Mec1/Tel1 consensus phosphorylation sites of Sae2, we found that mutations of Thr-90 and Thr-279 of Sae2 into alanine caused a persistent Rad53 activation in response to a transient DNA damage, similar to the loss of Sae2. To gain insight into the function of this phosphorylation of Sae2, we performed a quantitative proteomics analysis to identify its associated proteins. We found that phosphorylation of Thr-90 of Sae2 mediates its interaction with Rad53, Dun1, Xrs2, Dma1, and Dma2, whereas Rad53 and Dun1 additionally interact with phosphorylated Thr-279 of Sae2. Mutations of the ligand-binding residues of Forkhead-associated (FHA) domains of Rad53, Dun1, Xrs2, Dma1, and Dma2 abolished their interactions with Sae2, revealing the involvement of FHA-specific interactions. Mutations of Thr-90 and Thr-279 of Sae2 caused a synergistic defect when combined with sgs1Δ and exo1Δ and elevated gross chromosomal rearrangements. Likewise, mutations of RAD53 and DUN1 caused a synthetic growth defect with sgs1Δ and elevated gross chromosomal rearrangements. These findings suggest that threonine-specific phosphorylation of Sae2 by Mec1 and Tel1 contributes to DNA repair and genome maintenance via its interactions with Rad53 and Dun1.

https://openalex.org/W2079041841,"Purpose To develop a microRNA (miRNA)-based predictive model for prostate cancer patients of 1) time to biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and 2) biochemical recurrence after salvage radiation therapy following documented biochemical disease progression post-radical prostatectomy. Methods Forty three patients who had undergone salvage radiation therapy following biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy with greater than 4 years of follow-up data were identified. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were collected for all patients and total RNA was isolated from 1mm cores enriched for tumor (>70%). Eight hundred miRNAs were analyzed simultaneously using the nCounter human miRNA v2 assay (NanoString Technologies; Seattle, WA). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportion hazards regression models as well as receiver operating characteristics were used to identify statistically significant miRNAs that were predictive of biochemical recurrence. Results Eighty eight miRNAs were identified to be significantly (p<0.05) associated with biochemical failure post-prostatectomy by multivariate analysis and clustered into two groups that correlated with early (≤ 36 months) versus late recurrence (>36 months). Nine miRNAs were identified to be significantly (p<0.05) associated by multivariate analysis with biochemical failure after salvage radiation therapy. A new predictive model for biochemical recurrence after salvage radiation therapy was developed; this model consisted of miR-4516 and miR-601 together with, Gleason score, and lymph node status. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was improved to 0.83 compared to that of 0.66 for Gleason score and lymph node status alone. Conclusion miRNA signatures can distinguish patients who fail soon after radical prostatectomy versus late failures, giving insight into which patients may need adjuvant therapy. Notably, two novel miRNAs (miR-4516 and miR-601) were identified that significantly improve prediction of biochemical failure post-salvage radiation therapy compared to clinico-histopathological factors, supporting the use of miRNAs within clinically used predictive models. Both findings warrant further validation studies."

https://openalex.org/W2056146179,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common adult malignant glioma with poor prognosis due to the resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which might be critically involved in the repopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) after treatment. We had investigated the characteristics of cancer stem-like side population (SP) cells sorted from GBM cells, and studied the effect of Honokiol targeting on CSCs. GBM8401 SP cells possessed the stem cell markers, such as nestin, CD133 and Oct4, and the expressions of self-renewal related stemness genes, such as SMO, Notch3 and IHH (Indian Hedgehog). Honokiol inhibited the proliferation of both GBM8401 parental cells and SP cells in a dose-dependent manner, the IC50 were 5.3±0.72 and 11±1.1 μM, respectively. The proportions of SP in GBM8401 cells were diminished by Honokiol from 1.5±0.22% down to 0.3±0.02% and 0.2±0.01% at doses of 2.5 μM and 5 μM, respectively. The SP cells appeared to have higher expression of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and be more resistant to Temozolomide (TMZ). The resistance to TMZ could be only slightly reversed by MGMT inhibitor O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG), but markedly further enhanced by Honokiol addition. Such significant enhancement was accompanied with the higher induction of apoptosis, greater down-regulation of Notch3 as well as its downstream Hes1 expressions in SP cells. Our data indicate that Honokiol might have clinical benefits for the GBM patients who are refractory to TMZ treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2110943691,"The experimental determination of the structure of protein complexes cannot keep pace with the generation of interactomic data, hence resulting in an ever-expanding gap. As the structural details of protein complexes are central to a full understanding of the function and dynamics of the cell machinery, alternative strategies are needed to circumvent the bottleneck in structure determination. Computational protein docking is a valid and valuable approach to model the structure of protein complexes. In this work, we describe a novel computational strategy to predict the structure of protein complexes based on data-driven docking: VORFFIP-driven dock (V-D2OCK). This new approach makes use of our newly described method to predict functional sites in protein structures, VORFFIP, to define the region to be sampled during docking and structural clustering to reduce the number of models to be examined by users. V-D2OCK has been benchmarked using a validated and diverse set of protein complexes and compared to a state-of-art docking method. The speed and accuracy compared to contemporary tools justifies the potential use of VD2OCK for high-throughput, genome-wide, protein docking. Finally, we have developed a web interface that allows users to browser and visualize V-D2OCK predictions from the convenience of their web-browsers."

The molecular mechanisms underlying this occurrence are still not completely understood. This study investigated the prevalence of OBI in a high-risk Australian population and compared the HBV S gene sequences of our cohort with reference sequences. Serum from HBV DNA positive, HBsAg negative, and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive patients (study cohort) were obtained from samples tested at SEALS Serology Laboratory using the Abbott Architect, as part of screening and diagnostic testing. From a total of 228,108 samples reviewed, 1,451 patients were tested for all three OBI markers. Only 10 patients (0.69%) out of the 1,451 patients were found to fit the selection criteria for OBI. Sequence analysis of the HBV S gene from 5 suspected OBI infected patients showed increased sequence variability in the 'a' epitope of the major hydrophilic region compared to reference sequences. In addition, a total of eight consistent nucleotide substitutions resulting in seven amino acid changes were observed, and three patients had truncated S gene sequence. These mutations appeared to be stable and may result in alterations in HBsAg conformation. These may negatively impact the affinity of hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) and may explain the false negative results in serological HBV diagnosis. These changes may also enable the virus to persist in the liver by evading immune surveillance. Further studies on a bigger cohort are required to determine whether these amino acid variations have been acquired in the process of immune escape and serve as markers of OBI."

Here we explore if apoptotic stimuli, manifested through caspase activation, influences cardiac progenitor up-regulation and cardiomyocyte differentiation. Using mouse embryonic stem cells as a cellular model, we show that sublethal activation of caspases increases the yield of cardiomyocytes while concurrently promoting the proliferation and differentiation of c-Kit+/α-actininlow cardiac progenitor cells. A broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor blocked these effects. In addition, the caspase inhibitor reversed the mRNA expression of genes expressed in cardiomyocytes and their precursors. Our study demonstrates that sublethal caspase-activation has an important role in cardiomyocyte differentiation and may have significant implications for promoting cardiac regeneration after myocardial injury involving exogenous or endogenous cell sources."
https://openalex.org/W2046690457,"The aims of this study were to determine if the protein source of the medium influences zebu embryo development and if developmental kinetics, developmental block and programmed cell death are related. The culture medium was supplemented with either fetal calf serum or bovine serum albumin. The embryos were classified as Fast (n = 1,235) or Slow (n = 485) based on the time required to reach the fourth cell cycle (48 h and 90 h post insemination - hpi -, respectively). The Slow group was further separated into two groups: those presenting exactly 4 cells at 48 hpi (Slow/4 cells) and those that reached the fourth cell cycle at 90 hpi (Slow). Blastocyst quality, DNA fragmentation, mitochondrial membrane potential and signs of apoptosis or necrosis were evaluated. The Slow group had higher incidence of developmental block than the Fast group. The embryos supplemented with fetal calf serum had lower quality. DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial membrane potential were absent in embryos at 48 hpi but present at 90 hpi. Early signs of apoptosis were more frequent in the Slow and Slow/4 cell groups than in the Fast group. We concluded that fetal calf serum reduces blastocyst development and quality, but the mechanism appears to be independent of DNA fragmentation. The apoptotic cells detected at 48 hpi reveal a possible mechanism of programmed cell death activation prior to genome activation. The apoptotic cells observed in the slow-developing embryos suggested a relationship between programmed cell death and embryonic developmental kinetics in zebu in vitro-produced embryos."

CNVs were not detected in patients with only one mutant allele and mutation-negative determined by gene sequencing. There is a significantly higher incidence of patients with EIF2B3 mutations compared with Caucasian patients (32% vs. 4%). c.1037T>C (p.Ile346Thr) in EIF2B3 was confirmed to be a founder mutation in Chinese, which probably one of the causes of the genotypic differences between ethnicities. Our average 4.4 years-follow-up on infantile, early childhood and juvenile VWM children suggested a rapid deterioration in motor function. Episodic aggravation was presented in 90% of infantile cases and 71.4% of childhood cases. 10 patients died during the follow-up.

https://openalex.org/W2064514960,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons in the central nervous system. Although most cases of ALS are sporadic, about 5–10% of cases are familial (FALS) with approximately 20% of FALS caused by mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene. We have reported that hSOD1-G93A transgenic mice modeling this disease show a more severe phenotype when the transgene is bred on a pure SJL background and a milder phenotype when bred on a pure B6 background and that these phenotype differences link to a region on mouse Chromosome 17.To examine whether other models of motor neuron degeneration are affected by genetic background, we bred the mutant human dynactin p150Glued (G59S-hDCTN1) transgene onto inbred SJL and B6 congenic lines. This model is based on an autosomal dominant lower motor neuron disease in humans linked to a mutation in the p150Glued subunit of the dynactin complex. As seen in hSOD1-G93A mice, we observed a more severe phenotype with earlier disease onset (p<0.001) and decreased survival (p<0.00001) when the G59S-hDCTN1 transgene was bred onto the SJL background and delayed onset (p<0.0001) with increased survival (p<0.00001) when bred onto the B6 background. Furthermore, B6 mice with an SJL derived chromosome 17 interval previously shown to delay disease onset in hSOD1-G93A mice also showed delays onset in G59S-hDCTN1 mice suggesting that at least some genetic modifiers are shared. We have shown that genetic background influences phenotype in G59S-hDCTN1 mice, in part through a region of chromosome 17 similar to the G93-hSOD1 ALS mouse model. These results support the presence of genetic modifiers in both these models some of which may be shared. Identification of these modifiers will highlight intracellular pathways involved in motor neuron disease and provide new therapeutic targets that may be applicable to motor neuron degeneration."

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is induced during β-cell apoptosis due to various stimuli, and our work indicates that group VIA phospholipase A2β (iPLA2β) participates in this process. Delineation of underlying mechanism(s) reveals that ER stress reduces the anti-apoptotic Bcl-x(L) protein in INS-1 cells. The Bcl-x pre-mRNA undergoes alternative pre-mRNA splicing to generate Bcl-x(L) or Bcl-x(S) mature mRNA. We show that both thapsigargin-induced and spontaneous ER stress are associated with reductions in the ratio of Bcl-x(L)/Bcl-x(S) mRNA in INS-1 and islet β-cells. However, chemical inactivation or knockdown of iPLA2β augments the Bcl-x(L)/Bcl-x(S) ratio. Furthermore, the ratio is lower in islets from islet-specific RIP-iPLA2β transgenic mice, whereas islets from global iPLA2β−/− mice exhibit the opposite phenotype. In view of our earlier reports that iPLA2β induces ceramide accumulation through neutral sphingomyelinase 2 and that ceramides shift the Bcl-x 5′-splice site (5′SS) selection in favor of Bcl-x(S), we investigated the potential link between Bcl-x splicing and the iPLA2β/ceramide axis.

The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is regulated by members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that can be pro- or anti-apoptotic, depending on the spectrum of Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains that they contain. Among the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members is Bcl-x(L), which associates with mitochondrial membranes and prevents their permeabilization, an early step in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway (26Michels J.

Metab. 2000; 278: E340-E351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that stabilization of the Bcl-x(L) protein mass could be a key to preserving β-cell viability. However, very little is known of the processes that regulate endogenous Bcl-x(L) protein in β-cells. Modulation of Bcl-x(L) expression is a complex mechanism consisting of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. Among the well studied regulatory mechanisms in non-β-cell systems is alternative splicing of Bcl-x pre-mRNA. This is a common process among the regulators of apoptosis and often leads to generation of both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins from a single pre-mRNA (28Yip K.W. Reed J.C. Bcl-2 family proteins and cancer.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 6398-6406Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 34Schwerk C. Schulze-Osthoff K. Regulation of apoptosis by alternative pre-mRNA splicing.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Bcl-x(L) is the most abundant variant of the Bcl-x pre-mRNA, but other species can be generated at the expense of the mature mRNA encoding this anti-apoptotic protein (28Yip K.W. Reed J.C. Bcl-2 family proteins and cancer.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 6398-6406Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). For instance, a well documented Bcl-x splicing event is the one that determines whether Bcl-x(L) or Bcl-x(S) is generated. Bcl-x(S) is produced by activation of an upstream 5′-splice site (5′SS) within the Bcl-x exon 2 and blockage of the downstream (Bcl-x(L)-specific) 5′SS in Bcl-x exon 2. RNA oligonucleotides targeted to the downstream 5′SS induce Bcl-x(S) expression, down-regulate Bcl-x(L) protein, and sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy (35Mercatante D.R. Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Kole R. Modification of alternative splicing of Bcl-x pre-mRNA in prostate and breast cancer cells. analysis of apoptosis and cell death.J. Biol.

Anti-tumor activity of splice-switching oligonucleotides.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 8348-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of the 5′SS selection within the Bcl-x exon 2 is a critical factor in determining whether a cell is susceptible or resistant to apoptosis. Although molecular mechanisms controlling Bcl-x splicing have been studied, the mechanisms differ substantially depending on the cell system. For example, de novo ceramide generation in response to chemotherapeutics and apoptotic agonists (e.g. Fas ligand) has been implicated in the activation of the Bcl-x(S) 5′SS in transformed cells (37Chalfant C.E. Rathman K. Pinkerman R.L. Wood R.E. Obeid L.M. Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. De novo ceramide regulates the alternative splicing of caspase 9 and Bcl-x in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells–dependence on protein phosphatase-1.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12587-12595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In contrast, Chabot and co-workers (38Revil T. Pelletier J. Toutant J. Cloutier A. Chabot B. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K represses the production of pro-apoptotic Bcl-x(S) splice isoform.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21458-21467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have implicated a classical protein kinase C mechanism for regulating Bcl-x RNA splicing in nontransformed cells. Hence, the signaling mechanism in a particular cell system must be considered, and to date, Bcl-x RNA splicing has not been investigated in the β-cell, especially in the context of β-cell apoptosis and diabetes mellitus. The experiments described herein were designed to test our hypothesis that iPLA2β regulates Bcl-x(L) splicing and promotes usage of the alternative 5′SS. We demonstrate that both chemical inactivation and genetic ablation or knockdown of iPLA2β shift Bcl-x splicing in favor of anti-apoptotic Bcl-x(L) and that iPLA2β inactivation largely prevents the shift in Bcl-x splicing that occurs upon ER stress-induced apoptosis. Unexpectedly, the effects of iPLA2β are found to be largely independent of ceramide but are modulated by bioactive metabolites of arachidonic acid. These observations reveal a novel role for iPLA2β in survival of β-cells.

Postnatal day 2 mice received unilateral injections of 100,000 GFP+ hNPCs into the right parietal cortex. Eight weeks after transplantation, 1.21% of transplanted hNPCs survived. In these hNPCs, parvalbumin (PV)-, calretinin (CR)-, somatostatin (SS)-positive inhibitory interneurons and excitatory pyramidal neurons were confirmed electrophysiologically and histologically. All GFP+ hNPCs were immunoreactive with anti-human specific nuclear protein. The proportions of PV-, CR-, and SS-positive cells among GFP+ cells were 35.5%, 15.7%, and 17.1%, respectively; around 15% of GFP+ cells were identified as pyramidal neurons. Those electrophysiologically and histological identified GFP+ hNPCs were shown to fire action potentials with the appropriate firing patterns for different classes of neurons and to display spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs and sIPSCs). The amplitude, frequency and kinetic properties of sEPSCs and sIPSCs in different types of hNPCs were comparable to host cells of the same type. In conclusion, GFP+ hNPCs produce neurons that are competent to integrate functionally into host neocortical neuronal networks. This provides promising data on the potential for hNPCs to serve as therapeutic agents in neurological diseases with abnormal neuronal circuitry such as epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2169223483,"Background Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are largely considered to be pathogenic to normal endothelial function in disease states such as sepsis. We hypothesized that Angiopoietin-1 (Angpt-1), an endogenous agonist of the endothelial-specific receptor, Tie-2, promotes barrier defense by activating NADPH oxidase (NOX) signaling. Methods and Findings Using primary human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs), we found that Angpt-1 stimulation induces phosphorylation of p47phox and a brief oxidative burst that is lost when chemical inhibitors of NOX activity or siRNA against the NOX component p47phox were applied. As a result, there was attenuated ROS activity, disrupted junctional contacts, enhanced actin stress fiber accumulation, and induced gap formation between confluent HMVECs. All of these changes were associated with weakened barrier function. The ability of Angpt-1 to prevent identical changes induced by inflammatory permeability mediators, thrombin and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), was abrogated by p47phox knockdown. P47phox was required for Angpt-1 to activate Rac1 and inhibit mediator-induced activation of the small GTPase RhoA. Finally, Angpt-1 gene transfer prevented vascular leakage in wildtype mice exposed to systemically administered LPS, but not in p47phox knock out (p47−/−) littermates. Conclusions These results suggest an essential role for NOX signaling in Angpt-1-mediated endothelial barrier defense against mediators of systemic inflammation. More broadly, oxidants generated for signal transduction may have a barrier-promoting role in vascular endothelium."
https://openalex.org/W2039958421,"Insecticide-resistant Drosophila melanogaster strains represent a resource for the discovery of the underlying molecular mechanisms of cytochrome P450 constitutive over-expression, even if some of these P450s are not directly involved in the resistance phenotype. For example, in select 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) resistant strains the glucocorticoid receptor-like (GR-like) potential transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs) have previously been shown to be associated with constitutively differentially-expressed cytochrome P450s, Cyp12d1, Cyp6g2 and Cyp9c1. However, insects are not known to have glucocorticoids. The only ortholog to the mammalian glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in D. melanogaster is an estrogen-related receptor (ERR) gene, which has two predicted alternative splice isoforms (ERRa and ERRb). Sequencing of ERRa and ERRb in select DDT susceptible and resistant D. melanogaster strains has revealed a glycine (G) codon insertion which was only observed in the ligand binding domain of ERR from the resistant strains tested (ERR-G). Transgenic flies, expressing the ERRa-G allele, constitutively over-expressed Cyp12d1, Cyp6g2 and Cyp9c1. Only Cyp12d1 and Cyp6g2 were over-expressed in the ERRb-G transgenic flies. Phylogenetic studies show that the G-insertion appeared to be located in a less conserved domain in ERR and this insertion is found in multiple species across the Sophophora subgenera."
https://openalex.org/W2152420868,"Following the finding that ammodytoxin (Atx), a neurotoxic secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) in snake venom, binds specifically to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) in vitro we show that these proteins also interact in living rat PC12 cells that are able to internalize this group IIA (GIIA) sPLA2. Atx and PDI co-localize in both differentiated and non-differentiated PC12 cells, as shown by fluorescence microscopy. Based on a model of the complex between Atx and yeast PDI (yPDI), a three-dimensional model of the complex between Atx and human PDI (hPDI) was constructed. The Atx binding site on hPDI is situated between domains b and b’. Atx interacts hPDI with an extensive area on its interfacial binding surface. The mammalian GIB, GIIA, GV and GX sPLA2s have the same fold as Atx. The first three sPLA2s have been detected intracellularly but not the last one. The models of their complexes with hPDI were constructed by replacement of Atx with the respective mammalian sPLA2 in the Atx—hPDI complex and molecular docking of the structures. According to the generated models, mammalian GIB, GIIA and GV sPLA2s form complexes with hPDI very similar to that with Atx. The contact area between GX sPLA2 and hPDI is however different from that of the other sPLA2s. Heterologous competition of Atx binding to hPDI with GV and GX sPLA2s confirmed the model-based expectation that GV sPLA2 was a more effective inhibitor than GX sPLA2, thus validating our model. The results suggest a role of hPDI in the (patho)physiology of some snake venom and mammalian sPLA2s by assisting the retrograde transport of these molecules from the cell surface. The sPLA2–hPDI model constitutes a valuable tool to facilitate further insights into this process and into the (patho)physiology of sPLA2s in relation to their action intracellularly."
https://openalex.org/W2029554163,"Diversity is mainly determined by climate and environment. In addition, topography is a complex factor, and the relationship between topography and biodiversity is still poorly understood. To understand the role of topography, i.e., altitude and slope, in biodiversity, we selected Jinggangshan Mountain (JGM), an area with unique topography, as the study area. We surveyed plant and animal species richness of JGM and compared the biodiversity and the main geographic characteristics of JGM with the adjacent 4 mountains. Gleason’s richness index was calculated to assess the diversity of species. In total, 2958 spermatophyte species, 418 bryophyte species, 355 pteridophyte species and 493 species of vertebrate animals were recorded in this survey. In general, the JGM biodiversity was higher than that of the adjacent mountains. Regarding topographic characteristics, 77% of JGM’s area was in the mid-altitude region and approximately 40% of JGM’s area was in the 10°–20° slope range, which may support more vegetation types in JGM area and make it a biodiversity hotspot. It should be noted that although the impact of topography on biodiversity was substantial, climate is still a more general factor driving the formation and maintenance of higher biodiversity. Topographic conditions can create microclimates, and both climatic and topographic conditions contribute to the formation of high biodiversity in JGM."
https://openalex.org/W2053258529,"Modern pollen records have been used to successfully distinguish between specific prairie types in North America. Whether the pollen records can be used to detect the occurrence of Eurasian steppe, or even to further delimit various steppe types was until now unclear. Here we characterized modern pollen assemblages of meadow steppe, typical steppe and desert steppe from eastern Eurasia along an ecological humidity gradient. The multivariate ordination of the pollen data indicated that Eurasian steppe types could be clearly differentiated. The different steppe types could be distinguished primarily by xerophilous elements in the pollen assemblages. Redundancy analysis indicated that the relative abundances of Ephedra, Tamarix, Nitraria and Zygophyllaceae were positively correlated with aridity. The relative abundances of Ephedra increased from meadow steppe to typical steppe and desert steppe. Tamarix and Zygophyllaceae were found in both typical steppe and desert steppe, but not in meadow steppe. Nitraria was only found in desert steppe. The relative abundances of xerophilous elements were greater in desert steppe than in typical steppe. These findings indicate that Eurasian steppe types can be differentiated based on recent pollen rain."
https://openalex.org/W2162126513,"Survivin is a key member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, and is considered a promising therapeutic target due to its universal overexpression in cancers. Survivin is implicated in cellular radiation response through its role in apoptosis, cell division, and DNA damage response. In the present study, analysis of publically available data sets showed that survivin gene expression increased with breast cancer stage (p < 0.00001) and was significantly higher in estrogen receptor-negative cancers as compared to estrogen receptor-positive cancers (p = 9e-46). However, survivin was prognostic in estrogen receptor-positive tumors (p = 0.03) but not in estrogen receptor-negative tumors (p = 0.28). We assessed the effect of a survivin dominant-negative mutant on colony-formation (2D) and mammosphere-formation (3D) efficiency, and radiation response in the estrogen receptor-positive MCF7 and estrogen receptor-negative SUM149 breast cancer cell lines. The colony-formation efficiency was significantly lower in the dominant-negative survivin-transduced cells versus control MCF7 cells (0.42 vs. 0.58, p < 0.01), but it was significantly higher in dominant-negative population versus control-transduced SUM149 cells (0.29 vs. 0.20, p < 0.01). A similar, non-significant, trend in mammosphere-formation efficiency was observed. We compared the radiosensitivity of cells stably expressing dominant-negative survivin with their controls in both cell lines under 2D and 3D culture conditions following exposure to increasing doses of radiation. We found that the dominant-negative populations were radioprotective in MCF7 cells but radiosensitive in SUM149 cells compared to the control-transduced population; further, Taxol was synergistic with the survivin mutant in SUM149 but not MCF7. Our data suggests that survivin modulation influences radiation response differently in estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer subtypes, warranting further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1993721667,"Case-control association studies often suffer from population stratification bias. A previous triple combination strategy of stratum matching, genomic controlling, and multiple DNA pooling can correct the bias and save genotyping cost. However the method requires researchers to prepare a multitude of DNA pools-more than 30 case-control pooling sets in total (polyset). In this paper, the authors propose a permutation test for oligoset DNA pooling studies. Monte-Carlo simulations show that the proposed test has a type I error rate under control and a power comparable to that of individual genotyping. For a researcher on a tight budget, oligoset DNA pooling is a viable option."
