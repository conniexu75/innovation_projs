https://openalex.org/W2122598808,"Resveratrol in high doses has been shown to extend lifespan in some studies in invertebrates and to prevent early mortality in mice fed a high-fat diet. We fed mice from middle age (14-months) to old age (30-months) either a control diet, a low dose of resveratrol (4.9 mg kg(-1) day(-1)), or a calorie restricted (CR) diet and examined genome-wide transcriptional profiles. We report a striking transcriptional overlap of CR and resveratrol in heart, skeletal muscle and brain. Both dietary interventions inhibit gene expression profiles associated with cardiac and skeletal muscle aging, and prevent age-related cardiac dysfunction. Dietary resveratrol also mimics the effects of CR in insulin mediated glucose uptake in muscle. Gene expression profiling suggests that both CR and resveratrol may retard some aspects of aging through alterations in chromatin structure and transcription. Resveratrol, at doses that can be readily achieved in humans, fulfills the definition of a dietary compound that mimics some aspects of CR."
https://openalex.org/W2113894722,"The asymmetric localization of mRNA plays an important role in coordinating posttranscriptional events in eukaryotic cells. We investigated the peripheral mitochondrial localization of nuclear-encoded mRNAs (MLR) in various conditions in which the mRNA binding protein context and the translation efficiency were altered. We identified Puf3p, a Pumilio family RNA-binding protein, as the first trans-acting factor controlling the MLR phenomenon. This allowed the characterization of two classes of genes whose mRNAs are translated to the vicinity of mitochondria. Class I mRNAs (256 genes) have a Puf3p binding motif in their 3'UTR region and many of them have their MLR properties deeply affected by PUF3 deletion. Conversely, mutations in the Puf3p binding motif alter the mitochondrial localization of BCS1 mRNA. Class II mRNAs (224 genes) have no Puf3p binding site and their asymmetric localization is not affected by the absence of PUF3. In agreement with a co-translational import process, we observed that the presence of puromycin loosens the interactions between most of the MLR-mRNAs and mitochondria. Unexpectedly, cycloheximide, supposed to solidify translational complexes, turned out to destabilize a class of mRNA-mitochondria interactions. Classes I and II mRNAs, which are therefore transported to the mitochondria through different pathways, correlated with different functional modules. Indeed, Class I genes code principally for the assembly factors of respiratory chain complexes and the mitochondrial translation machinery (ribosomes and translation regulators). Class II genes encode proteins of the respiratory chain or proteins involved in metabolic pathways. Thus, MLR, which is intimately linked to translation control, and the activity of mRNA-binding proteins like Puf3p, may provide the conditions for a fine spatiotemporal control of mitochondrial protein import and mitochondrial protein complex assembly. This work therefore provides new openings for the global study of mitochondria biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2003075709,"Objectives To develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a home based intervention in reducing caregiver burden, promoting caregiver mental health and reducing behavioural problems in elderly persons with dementia. Methodology and Principal Findings This was a randomised controlled trial in which the person with dementia-caregiver dyad was randomly allocated either to receive the intervention immediately or to a waiting list group which received the intervention after 6 months. It was carried out in communities based in two talukas (administrative blocks) in Goa, India. Mild to moderate cases with dementia (diagnosed using the DSM IV criteria and graded using the Clinical Dementia Rating scale) and their caregivers were included in the trial. Community based intervention provided by a team consisting of Home Care Advisors who were supervised by a counselor and a psychiatrist, focusing on supporting the caregiver through information on dementia, guidance on behaviour management, a single psychiatric assessment and psychotropic medication if needed. We measured caregiver mental health (General Health Questionnaire), caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Score), distress due to behavioural disturbances (NPI-D), behavioural problems in the subject (NPI-S) and activities of daily living in the elder with dementia (EASI). Outcome evaluations were masked to the allocation status. We analysed each outcome with a mixed effects model. 81 families enrolled in the trial; 41 were randomly allocated to the intervention. 59 completed the trial and 18 died during the trial. The intervention led to a significant reduction of GHQ (−1.12, 95% CI −2.07 to −0.17) and NPI-D scores (−1.96, 95%CI −3.51 to −0.41) and non-significant reductions in the ZBS, EASI and NPI-S scores. We also observed a non-significant reduction in the total number of deaths in people with dementia in the intervention arm (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.03). Conclusion Home based support for caregivers of persons with dementia, which emphasizes the use of locally available, low-cost human resources, is feasible, acceptable and leads to significant improvements in caregiver mental health and burden of caring.

https://openalex.org/W2023824803,"Background Since mature erythrocytes are terminally differentiated cells without nuclei and organelles, it is commonly thought that they do not contain nucleic acids. In this study, we have re-examined this issue by analyzing the transcriptome of a purified population of human mature erythrocytes from individuals with normal hemoglobin (HbAA) and homozygous sickle cell disease (HbSS). Methods and Findings Using a combination of microarray analysis, real-time RT-PCR and Northern blots, we found that mature erythrocytes, while lacking ribosomal and large-sized RNAs, contain abundant and diverse microRNAs. MicroRNA expression of erythrocytes was different from that of reticulocytes and leukocytes, and contributed the majority of the microRNA expression in whole blood. When we used microRNA microarrays to analyze erythrocytes from HbAA and HbSS individuals, we noted a dramatic difference in their microRNA expression pattern. We found that miR-320 played an important role for the down-regulation of its target gene, CD71 during reticulocyte terminal differentiation. Further investigation revealed that poor expression of miR-320 in HbSS cells was associated with their defective downregulation CD71 during terminal differentiation. Conclusions In summary, we have discovered significant microRNA expression in human mature erythrocytes, which is dramatically altered in HbSS erythrocytes and their defect in terminal differentiation. Thus, the global analysis of microRNA expression in circulating erythrocytes can provide mechanistic insights into the disease phenotypes of erythrocyte diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2118083821,"Honeybees, Apis mellifera, readily learn to associate odours with sugar rewards and we show here that recall of the olfactory memory, as demonstrated by the bee extending its proboscis when presented with the trained odour, involves first the right and then the left antenna. At 1-2 hour after training using both antennae, recall is possible mainly when the bee uses its right antenna but by 6 hours after training a lateral shift has occurred and the memory can now be recalled mainly when the left antenna is in use. Long-term memory one day after training is also accessed mainly via the left antenna. This time-dependent shift from right to left antenna is also seen as side biases in responding to odour presented to the bee's left or right side. Hence, not only are the cellular events of memory formation similar in bees and vertebrate species but also the lateralized networks involved may be similar. These findings therefore seem to call for remarkable parallel evolution and suggest that the proper functioning of memory formation in a bilateral animal, either vertebrate or invertebrate, requires lateralization of processing."
https://openalex.org/W1976175714,"Hydrostatic pressure (HP) is a significant factor in the function of many tissues, including cartilage, knee meniscus, temporomandibular joint disc, intervertebral disc, bone, bladder, and vasculature. Though studies have been performed in assessing the role of HP in tissue biochemistry, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have demonstrated enhanced mechanical properties from HP application in any tissue.The objective of this study was to determine the effects of hydrostatic pressure (HP), with and without growth factors, on the biomechanical and biochemical properties of engineered articular cartilage constructs, using a two-phased approach. In phase I, a 3x3 full-factorial design of HP magnitude (1, 5, 10 MPa) and frequency (0, 0.1, 1 Hz) was used, and the best two treatments were selected for use in phase II. Static HP at 5 MPa and 10 MPa resulted in significant 95% and 96% increases, respectively, in aggregate modulus (H(A)), with corresponding increases in GAG content. These regimens also resulted in significant 101% and 92% increases in Young's modulus (E(Y)), with corresponding increases in collagen content. Phase II employed a 3x3 full-factorial design of HP (no HP, 5 MPa static, 10 MPa static) and growth factor application (no GF, BMP-2+IGF-I, TGF-beta1). The combination of 10 MPa static HP and TGF-beta1 treatment had an additive effect on both H(A) and E(Y), as well as a synergistic effect on collagen content. This group demonstrated a 164% increase in H(A), a 231% increase in E(Y), an 85% increase in GAG/wet weight (WW), and a 173% increase in collagen/WW, relative to control.To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate increases in the biomechanical properties of tissue from pure HP application, using a cartilage model. Furthermore, it is the only study to demonstrate additive or synergistic effects between HP and growth factors on tissue functional properties. These findings are exciting as coupling HP stimulation with growth factor application has allowed for the formation of tissue engineered constructs with biomechanical and biochemical properties spanning native tissue values."
https://openalex.org/W1986581321,"Adult neurogenesis in mammals is restricted to some brain regions, in contrast with other vertebrates in which the genesis of new neurons is more widespread in different areas of the nervous system. In the mammalian cerebellum, neurogenesis is thought to be limited to the early postnatal period, coinciding with end of the granule cell genesis and disappearance of the external granule cell layer (EGL). We recently showed that in the rabbit cerebellum the EGL is replaced by a proliferative layer called 'subpial layer' (SPL) which persists beyond puberty on the cerebellar surface. Here we investigated what happens in the cerebellar cortex of peripuberal rabbits by using endogenous and exogenously-administered cell proliferation antigens in association with a cohort of typical markers for neurogenesis. We show that cortical cell progenitors extensively continue to be generated herein. Surprisingly, this neurogenic process continues to a lesser extent in the adult, even in the absence of a proliferative SPL. We describe two populations of newly generated cells, involving neuronal cells and multipolar, glia-like cells. The genesis of neuronal precursors is restricted to the molecular layer, giving rise to cells immunoreactive for GABA, and for the transcription factor Pax2, a marker for GABAergic cerebellar interneuronal precursors of neuroepithelial origin that ascend through the white matter during early postnatal development. The multipolar cells are Map5+, contain Olig2 and Sox2 transcription factors, and are detectable in all cerebellar layers. Some dividing Sox2+ cells are Bergmann glia cells. All the cortical newly generated cells are independent from the SPL and from granule cell genesis, the latter ending before puberty. This study reveals that adult cerebellar neurogenesis can exist in some mammals. Since rabbits have a longer lifespan than rodents, the protracted neurogenesis within its cerebellar parenchyma could be a suitable model for studying adult nervous tissue permissiveness in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1996470116,"Background Although the statement that age is the greatest risk factor for Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is widely accepted, the cellular and molecular explanations for that clinical statement are not generally known. A major focus of AMD research is the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid. The purpose of this study was to characterize the changes in the RPE/choroid with age that may provide a background for the development of AMD. Methodology/Principal Findings We compared the transcriptional profiles, key protein levels and histology of the RPE/choroid from young and old mice. Using three statistical methods, microarray data demonstrated marked changes in the old mouse. There were 315 genes differentially expressed with age; most of these genes were related to immune responses and inflammatory activity. Canonical pathways having significant numbers of upregulated genes in aged RPE/choroid included leukocyte extravasation, complement cascades, natural killer cell signaling and IL-10 signaling. By contrast, the adjacent neural retina showed completely different age-related changes. The levels of proteins that participate in leukocyte extravasation and complement pathways were consistently increased in the normal, aged RPE/choroid. Furthermore, there was increased gene expression and protein levels of leukocyte attracting signal, chemokine ligand 2 (Ccl2) in aged RPE/choroid. In old animals, there was marked extravasation and accumulation of leukocytes from the choroidal circulation onto Bruch's membrane and into the RPE. Conclusions/Significance These phenotypic changes indicate that the RPE/choroid in the normal, old mouse has become an immunologically active tissue. There are signals from the normal, aged RPE/choroid which recruit leukocytes from the circulation and activate the complement cascade. These age-related changes that occur in the RPE/choroid with age, to the extent that they occur in the human retina, may provide the background for an error in regulation of immunological activity to cause AMD to appear in an elderly individual."
https://openalex.org/W2020120915,"Salmonella Typhimurium is a major cause of human gastroenteritis. The Salmonella type III secretory system secretes virulence proteins, called effectors. Effectors are responsible for the alteration of tight junction (TJ) structure and function in intestinal epithelial cells. AvrA is a newly described bacterial effector found in Salmonella. We report here that AvrA expression stabilizes cell permeability and tight junctions in intestinal epithelial cells. Cells colonized with an AvrA-deficient bacterial strain (AvrA-) displayed decreased cell permeability, disruption of TJs, and an increased inflammatory response. Western blot data showed that TJ proteins, such as ZO-1, claudin-1, decreased after AvrA- colonization for only 1 hour. In contrast, cells colonized with AvrA-sufficient bacteria maintained cell permeability with stabilized TJ structure. This difference was confirmed in vivo. Fluorescent tracer studies showed increased fluorescence in the blood of mice infected with AvrA- compared to those infected with the AvrA-sufficient strains. AvrA- disrupted TJ structure and function and increased inflammation in vivo, compared to the AvrA- sufficient strain. Additionally, AvrA overexpression increased TJ protein expression when transfected into colonic epithelial cells. An intriguing aspect of this study is that AvrA stabilized TJs, even though the other TTSS proteins, SopB, SopE, and SopE2, are known to disrupt TJs. AvrA may play a role in stabilizing TJs and balancing the opposing action of other bacterial effectors. Our findings indicate an important role for the bacterial effector AvrA in regulation of intestinal epithelial cell TJs during inflammation. The role of AvrA represents a highly refined bacterial strategy that helps the bacteria survive in the host and dampen the inflammatory response."

https://openalex.org/W2075782930,"Background Global climate change is rapidly altering species range distributions and interactions within communities. As ranges expand, invading species change interactions in communities which may reduce stability, a mechanism known to affect biodiversity. In aridland ecosystems worldwide, the range of native shrubs is expanding as they invade and replace native grassland vegetation with significant consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Methodology We used two long-term data sets to determine the effects of shrub encroachment by Larrea tridentata on subdominant community composition and stability in formerly native perennial grassland dominated by Bouteloua eriopoda in New Mexico, USA. Principal Findings Our results indicated that Larrea invasion decreased species richness during the last 100 years. We also found that over shorter temporal scales species-poor subdominant communities in areas invaded by Larrea were less stable (more variable in time) compared to species rich communities in grass-dominated vegetation. Compositional stability increased as cover of Bouteloua increased and decreased as cover of Larrea increased. Significance Changes in community stability due to altered interspecific interactions may be one mechanism by which biodiversity declines in grasslands following shrub invasion. As global warming increases, shrub encroachment into native grasslands worldwide will continue to alter species interactions and community stability both of which may lead to a decline in biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2013669579,"Genotoxic stress triggers a rapid translocation of p53 to the mitochondria, contributing to apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner. Using immunopurification protocols and mass spectrometry, we previously identified the proapoptotic protein BAK as a mitochondrial p53-binding protein and showed that recombinant p53 directly binds to BAK and can induce its oligomerization, leading to cytochrome c release. In this work we describe a combination of molecular modeling, electrostatic analysis, and site-directed mutagenesis to define contact residues between BAK and p53. Our data indicate that three regions within the core DNA binding domain of p53 make contact with BAK; these are the conserved H2 alpha-helix and the L1 and L3 loop. Notably, point mutations in these regions markedly impair the ability of p53 to oligomerize BAK and to induce transcription-independent cell death. We present a model whereby positively charged residues within the H2 helix and L1 loop of p53 interact with an electronegative domain on the N-terminal alpha-helix of BAK; the latter is known to undergo conformational changes upon BAK activation. We show that mutation of acidic residues in the N-terminal helix impair the ability of BAK to bind to p53. Interestingly, many of the p53 contact residues predicted by our model are also direct DNA contact residues, suggesting that p53 interacts with BAK in a manner analogous to DNA. The combined data point to the H2 helix and L1 and L3 loops of p53 as novel functional domains contributing to transcription-independent apoptosis by this tumor suppressor protein."
https://openalex.org/W2146503516,"Many true parasites and parasitoids modify the behaviour of their host, and these changes are thought to be to the benefit of the parasites. However, field tests of this hypothesis are scarce, and it is often unclear whether the host or the parasite profits from the behavioural changes, or even if parasitism is a cause or consequence of the behaviour. We show that braconid parasitoids (Glyptapanteles sp.) induce their caterpillar host (Thyrinteina leucocerae) to behave as a bodyguard of the parasitoid pupae. After parasitoid larvae exit from the host to pupate, the host stops feeding, remains close to the pupae, knocks off predators with violent head-swings, and dies before reaching adulthood. Unparasitized caterpillars do not show these behaviours. In the field, the presence of bodyguard hosts resulted in a two-fold reduction in mortality of parasitoid pupae. Hence, the behaviour appears to be parasitoid-induced and confers benefits exclusively to the parasitoid."
https://openalex.org/W2103432965,"The introduction of predatory mammals to oceanic islands has led to the extinction of many endemic birds. Although introduced predators should favour changes that reduce predation risk in surviving bird species, the ability of island birds to respond to such novel changes remains unstudied. We tested whether novel predation risk imposed by introduced mammalian predators has altered the parental behaviour of the endemic New Zealand bellbird (Anthornis melanura). We examined parental behaviour of bellbirds at three woodland sites in New Zealand that differed in predation risk: 1) a mainland site with exotic predators present (high predation risk), 2) a mainland site with exotic predators experimentally removed (low risk recently) and, 3) an off-shore island where exotic predators were never introduced (low risk always). We also compared parental behaviour of bellbirds with two closely related Tasmanian honeyeaters (Phylidonyris spp.) that evolved with native nest predators (high risk always). Increased nest predation risk has been postulated to favour reduced parental activity, and we tested whether island bellbirds responded to variation in predation risk. We found that females spent more time on the nest per incubating bout with increased risk of predation, a strategy that minimised activity at the nest during incubation. Parental activity during the nestling period, measured as number of feeding visits/hr, also decreased with increasing nest predation risk across sites, and was lowest among the honeyeaters in Tasmania that evolved with native predators. These results demonstrate that some island birds are able to respond to increased risk of predation by novel predators in ways that appear adaptive. We suggest that conservation efforts may be more effective if they take advantage of the ability of island birds to respond to novel predators, especially when the elimination of exotic predators is not possible."
https://openalex.org/W2125352891,"Lack of functional hereditary hemochromatosis protein, HFE, causes iron overload predominantly in hepatocytes, the major site of HFE expression in the liver. In this study, we investigated the role of HFE in the regulation of both transferrin-bound iron (TBI) and non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) uptake in HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line. Expression of HFE decreased both TBI and NTBI uptake. It also resulted in a decrease in the protein levels of Zip14 with no evident change in the mRNA level of Zip14. Zip14 (Slc39a14) is a metal transporter that mediates NTBI into cells (Liuzzi, J. P., Aydemir, F., Nam, H., Knutson, M. D., and Cousins, R. J. (2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 103, 13612-13617). Knockdown of Zip14 with siRNA abolished the effect of HFE on NTBI uptake. To determine if HFE had a similar effect on Zip14 in another cell line, HeLa cells expressing HFE under the tetracycline-repressible promoter were transfected with Zip14. As in HepG2 cells, HFE expression inhibited NTBI uptake by approximately 50% and decreased Zip14 protein levels. Further analysis of protein turnover indicated that the half-life of Zip14 is lower in cells that express HFE. These results suggest that HFE decreases the stability of Zip14 and therefore reduces the iron loading in HepG2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1985844737,"Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with a higher risk of mortality. Overall, postmenopausal women have lower levels of HRV than premenopausal women, which may be additionally complicated by lifestyle related behaviors such as physical inactivity and obesity. Though cardiorespiratory exercise training increases HRV, little is known regarding the exercise dose necessary to promote this improvement.Our primary aim was to measure HRV in post-menopausal women following 6-months of exercise training. We examined supine resting HRV in 373 post-menopausal women (45-75 y) after 6-months of randomly assigned and double-blinded administered exercise training exercise training at 50%, 100% and 150% of the NIH Consensus Development Panel's recommended minimal physical activity level. This corresponded to 4, 8, or 12 kcal/kg per week (KKW) of energy expenditure. At baseline, we observed no significant differences in HRV or hormone replacement use between treatment groups. However, we did observe that Caucasian women and those taking antidepressant medications had lower levels of baseline HRV. After 6-months of exercise intervention, we observed a dose dependent increase in all parasympathetically derived time and frequency domain measurements across exercise groups after adjustment for age, ethnicity, antidepressants, and baseline rMSSD (all, P<0.001). For example, the parasympathetic index rMSSD was greater than control (23.19+/-1.0) for the 4-KKW (25.98+/-0.8; P = 0.14), 8-KKW (27.66+/-1.0; P<0.05), and 12-KKW (27.40+/-0.0; P<0.05) groups at follow-up.Moderate intensity exercise training exercise is sufficient to improve HRV in previously sedentary postmenopausal women in a dose-dependent manner, as 4-KKW is insufficient to improve parasympathetic indices of HRV, while 12-KKW conferred no greater improvement than 8-KKW.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT 00011193."
https://openalex.org/W2027256384,"Etomidate, one of the most potent general anesthetics used clinically, acts at micromolar concentrations as an anesthetic and positive allosteric modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid responses, whereas it inhibits muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at concentrations above 10 μm. We report here that TDBzl-etomidate, a photoreactive etomidate analog, acts as a positive allosteric nAChR modulator rather than an inhibitor, and we identify its binding sites by photoaffinity labeling.

For each receptor, five homologous subunits associate at a central axis that is the ion channel. The amino-terminal half of each subunit contributes to the extracellular domain where neurotransmitter binding sites are located at subunit interfaces (α-γ and α-δ in the α2βγδ Torpedo nAChR). The transmembrane domain (TMD) of each subunit is made up of a loose bundle of four α helices (M1–M4), with amino acids from each M2 helix contributing to the lumen of the ion channel, that is the binding site for many nAChR inhibitors (7Arias H.R.

There are also pockets in the TMD within each subunit helix bundle and at subunit interfaces that are potential binding sites for allosteric modulators. Drugs that bind to such sites and act as positive allosteric modulators of agonist binding may represent an important class of therapeutic agents as they will enhance the efficacy of endogenous neurotransmitter signaling while avoiding the prolonged, nonphysiological pattern of receptor activation produced by agonists. nicotinic acetylcholine receptor acetylcholine 2-(3-methyl-3H-diaziren-3-yl)ethyl 1-(phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate 4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]benzyl-1-(1-phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylate 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-iodophenyl)diazirine γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor carbamylcholine chloride S. aureus endopeptidase Glu-C endoproteinase Lys-C o-phthalaldehyde phencyclidine transmembrane domain high pressure liquid chromatography Torpedo physiological saline N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine phenylthiohydantoin.

Positive allosteric nAChR modulators have been identified, including natural products such as physostigmine and galantamine, which are active on muscle and neuronal nAChRs (17Okonjo K.O. Kuhlmann J.

ChemMedChem. 2007; 2: 746-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although physostigmine and galantamine probably bind in the nAChR extracellular domain (4Hansen S.B. Taylor P. J. Mol.

Biochem. 1993; 216: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the locations of the binding sites for the other modulators are unknown. We report here that TDBzl-etomidate, a photoreactive general anesthetic developed to provide an improved definition of etomidate binding sites in GABAARs (23Husain S.S. Nirthanan S. Ruesch D. Solt K. Cheng Q. Li G.D. Arevalo E. Olsen R.W. Raines D.E. Forman S.A. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 4818-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), acts as a novel positive allosteric modulator of muscle-type Torpedo nAChR. We used photoaffinity labeling, an experimental approach that directly identifies amino acids contributing to a drug binding site without assumptions about the protein points of contact (24Kotzyba-Hibert F. Kapfer I. Goeldner M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 1296-1312Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 25Vodovozova E.L. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2007; 72: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), to identify its binding sites in the nAChR TMD. Azietomidate, another photoreactive etomidate analog that is a general anesthetic and positive modulator of GABAARs, inhibits nAChRs similarly to etomidate (26Husain S.S. Ziebell M.R. Ruesch D. Hong F. Arevalo E. Kosterlitz J.A. Olsen R.W. Forman S.A. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling established that [3H]azietomidate binds in the nAChR ion channel (27Ziebell M.R. Nirthanan S. Husain S.S. Miller K.W. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17640-17649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas in GABAARs it binds in the TMD at the interface between β and α subunits that contains the γ-aminobutyric acid binding sites in the extracellular domain (16Li G.-D. Chiara D.C. Sawyer G.W. Husain S.S. Olsen R.W. Cohen J.B. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11599-11605Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Upon photoactivation, azietomidate, an aliphatic diazirine, forms a carbonium ion that reacts preferentially with acidic side chains and with nucleophilic residues (tyrosine and methionine) but not with aliphatic side chains. In contrast, TDBzl-etomidate, an aryl diazirine, forms a carbene intermediate that reacts efficiently with aliphatic and most other side chains (24Kotzyba-Hibert F. Kapfer I. Goeldner M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 1296-1312Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Based upon the pharmacological specificity of residue labeling and residue location in the nAChR structure, TDBzl-etomidate binds at two distinct sites in the transmembrane domain, one located at the interface between the α and γ subunits that is likely to be the site for positive allosteric modulation and the other within the lumen of the ion channel that is an inhibitory site. Materials—Membranes rich in nAChRs, containing 1–2 nmol of [3H]acetylcholine (ACh) binding sites/mg of protein, were isolated from Torpedo californica electric organs (Aquatic Research Consultants, San Pedro, CA) as described previously (28Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6987-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Nonradioactive TDBzl-etomidate and [3H]TDBzl-etomidate (16 Ci/mmol) were synthesized as described previously (23Husain S.S. Nirthanan S. Ruesch D. Solt K. Cheng Q. Li G.D. Arevalo E. Olsen R.W. Raines D.E. Forman S.A. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 4818-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). (R)(+)-etomidate was a gift from Dr. David Gemmell (Organon Laboratories Ltd., Cambridge, UK). [3H]Phencyclidine (PCP; 27 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [3H]tetracaine (30 Ci/mmol) was from Sibtech. [3H]ACh (1.9 Ci/mmol) was synthesized from choline and [3H]acetic anhydride. Staphylococcus aureus glutamyl endopeptidase Glu-C (V8 protease) was from ICN Biomedical, and endoproteinase Lys-C (EndoLys-C) was from Roche Applied Sciences. l-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was from Worthington. Electrophysiology—Standard two-electrode voltage clamp (oocyte clamp OC-725B, Warner Instruments) techniques were used to study the effects of etomidate and TDBzl-etomidate on wild-type Torpedo α2βγδ nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes as described previously (29Blanton M.P. Xie Y. Dangott L.J. Cohen J.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). TDBzl-etomidate was prepared at 0.1 m in methanol and diluted into low calcium ND96 recording solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) containing 1 μm atropine. Radioligand Binding Assays—The concentration-dependent effects of TDBzl-etomidate on the equilibrium binding of [3H]ACh, [3H]tetracaine, or [3H]PCP to Torpedo nAChR-rich membranes in Torpedo physiological saline (TPS; 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0) were studied by centrifugation binding assays in a TOMY TX201 centrifuge as described previously (30White B.H. Howard S. Cohen S.G. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21595-21607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TDBzl-etomidate was prepared at 50 mm in methanol and then diluted into TPS. For [3H]tetracaine (19 nm) or [3H]PCP (6 nm; ±1 mm carbamylcholine (Carb)), membrane suspensions (0.2 ml, 750 μg of protein/ml) were equilibrated with the drugs for 2 h prior to centrifugation. For the [3H]ACh binding assay, membrane suspensions were pretreated with diisopropylphosphofluoridate (∼0.5 mm) to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity, then [3H]ACh (11 nm) and drugs were equilibrated with dilute membrane suspensions (1 ml, 80 μg of protein/ml, 40 nm ACh binding sites) for 45 min before centrifugation. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 mm Carb for [3H]ACh, in the presence of 0.2 mm tetracaine for [3H]tetracaine, and in the presence of 1 mm proadifen (+Carb) or 1 mm tetracaine (-Carb) for [3H]PCP. At 1 mm TDBzl-etomidate, the highest concentration tested, the methanol concentration was 2%, which in control experiments altered [3H]ACh and [3H]PCP binding by <5% and reduced [3H]tetracaine binding by 20%. Data Analysis—The concentration dependence of etomidate inhibition of ACh-induced currents or TDBzl-etomidate inhibition of radioligand binding was fit to the single site binding equation f(x) = f0/[1 + (x/IC50)] + fns where f(x) is the current or total radioligand bound in the presence of inhibitor concentration x, f0 is the current or specific radioligand bound in the absence of inhibitor, fns is the leak current in the absence of ACh or nonspecific radioligand binding, and IC50 is the concentration of inhibitor associated with the inhibition of 50% of ACh-induced currents or radioligand binding. Photolabeling of nAChR-rich Membranes with [3H]TDBzl-etomidate—Frozen nAChR-rich Torpedo membranes were thawed, diluted 3-fold with TPS, and pelleted by centrifugation. The membrane pellets were then resuspended at 2 mg of protein/ml (∼2.4 μm ACh binding sites) in TPS with oxidized glutathione (1 mm) added to serve as an aqueous scavenger. [3H]TDBzl-etomidate was added to the membrane suspension and mixed by gentle agitation for about 10 min prior to the addition of other ligands. For photolabeling on an analytical scale, the membrane samples in polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes were equilibrated with 0.8 μm [3H]TDBzl-etomidate and additional ligands for 90 min at 4 °C. Following this, aliquots of 130 μl from each sample were placed in a 96-well microtiter plate. For photolabeling on a preparative scale, the membrane suspensions (10 mg of protein/condition) at 2 mg/ml concentration were incubated in 6-cm plastic Petri dishes for 45 min at 4 °C with 1.25 μm [3H]TDBzl-etomidate in the presence or absence of additional ligands. Membrane suspensions were then irradiated for 30 min on ice at 360 nm in a horizontal photochemical chamber reactor (Rayonet RPR-200, Southern New England Ultraviolet Co.) using RPR-3500 bulbs. Following irradiation, the samples were dissolved in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Proteolytic Digestions—Photolabeled membranes, solubilized in sample buffer, were separated on 1.5-mm-thick acrylamide gels (31White B.H. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8741-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The resolved polypeptides were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250 stain (analytical scale experiments) or with GelCode® Blue stain reagent (Pierce) (preparative scale experiments). The stained analytical gels were prepared for fluorography using Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), and the dried gels were exposed to film (Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat) at -80 °C for various times (4–8 weeks). In parallel experiments, the incorporation of 3H into individual nAChR subunits was quantified by liquid scintillation counting of excised gel slices containing the polypeptide bands of interest (28Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6987-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For preparative scale photolabeling, the gel bands containing the nAChR β, γ, and δ subunits were excised and passively eluted for 3 days into 12 ml of elution buffer (100 mm NH4HCO3, 0.1% SDS, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol). The α subunit bands were excised and placed in the wells of 15-cm-long, 15% acrylamide “mapping” gels with a 5-cm-long 4.5% acrylamide stacker for limited “in-gel” digestion with S. aureus V8 protease (31White B.H. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8741-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the mapping gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, and the proteolytic fragments of 20 kDa (αV8-20), 18 kDa (αV8-18), and 10 kDa (αV8-10) were excised and eluted. The eluates were then filtered and concentrated to <400 μl by centrifugal filtration (Vivaspin 15 Mr 5,000 concentrators, Vivascience Inc., Edgewood, NY). nAChR subunits or subunit fragments were precipitated with 75% acetone (12 h at -20 °C) and then resuspended in 200 μl of resuspension buffer (12 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.6). Based upon the MicroBCA Protein Assay (Pierce), 200–400 μg of nAChR β, γ, and δ subunits and 30–50 μg of αV8-20, αV8-18, and αV8-10 were isolated from 10 mg of membranes. The αV8-20 fragment (∼40 μg) and δ subunit (∼200 μg) were digested with EndoLys-C (0.5 units/sample) for 14 days. Aliquots of the γ and δ subunits in resuspension buffer were digested for 3 days with V8 protease (100%, w/w). Aliquots of the β subunit or αV8-10 in resuspension buffer supplemented with Genapol C-100 (0.5%) were digested with trypsin (10 units/sample) for 2 days. All digests were carried out at room temperature. The digests of αV8-20 and αV8-10 as well as the V8 protease digests of the γ and δ subunits were fractionated directly by reversed-phase HPLC, whereas the trypsin digests of β subunits and the EndoLys-C digests of δ subunits were further separated on a 1.5-mm-thick, 16.5% T, 6% C Tricine SDS-PAGE gel (32Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar, 33Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The Tricine gels were sectioned into 5-mm slices, the polypeptides in each slice were eluted, and the eluates containing the peaks of 3H were concentrated and fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC. Reversed-phase HPLC—Samples were fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC on an Agilent 1100 binary HPLC system at 40 °C using a Brownlee C4-Aquapore 7-μm (100 × 2.1 mm) column with an upstream C2 guard column. The elution of peptides was monitored by absorbance at 214 nm. Solvent A was 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B consisted of 60% acetonitrile, 40% 2-propanol, and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. A stepwise linear gradient was used: 0 min, 25% solvent B; 15 min, 28% solvent B; 30 min, 37% solvent B; 45 min, 52% solvent B; 60 min, 73% solvent B; 75 min, 100% solvent B; 80 min, 100% solvent B; 85 min 25% solvent B; and 90 min, 25% solvent B. The flow rate was 200 μl/min with 0.5-ml fractions collected. Sequence Analysis—Material for sequence analyses was isolated from four independent preparative photolabelings: Ia/b and IIa/b (control versus tetracaine), IIIa/b/c (control, +Carb, +proadifen), and IVa/b/c (+Carb, +PCP, +Carb+PCP). Amino-terminal sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems Procise 492 protein sequencer that was modified so that ⅙ of each cycle was analyzed for PTH derivative quantitation and ⅚ was collected for scintillation counting. HPLC fractions were usually drop-loaded at 45 °C onto BiobrenePlus®-treated glass fiber filters (Applied Biosystems catalog number 601111). Fractions containing αM4 or δM1, which are not sequenced efficiently on glass fiber supports, were immobilized on polyvinylidene filters using Prosorb® sample preparation cartridges (Applied Biosystems catalog number 401959). In some instances, the sequencing run was interrupted, and the sample on the filter was treated with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA), which reacts preferentially with primary amines over secondary amines (i.e. proline) and hence can be used to block Edman degradation of any peptide not containing an amino-terminal proline at that cycle (28Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6987-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 34Brauer A.W. Oman C.L. Margolies M.N. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The quantity of amino acids released was determined by peak heights, and the amount of each peptide was obtained from a nonlinear least squares fit (Sigma Plot, SPSS) of the equation f(x) = I0 × Rx where f(x) is pmol of the peptide residue in cycle x, I0 is the initial amount of peptide (in pmol), and R is the average repetitive yield. PTH derivatives known to have poor recovery (Ser, Cys, His, and Trp) were omitted from the fit because of known problems with their quantitations. The efficiency of photolabeling of amino acid residues (cpm/pmol) was calculated as (cpmx - cpm(x - 1))/(5 × I0 × Rx). Molecular Modeling—A homology model of the T. californica nAChR, constructed using the Discovery Studio (Accelerys, Inc.) software package from the structural model of the Torpedo marmorata nAChR (Protein Data Bank code 2BG9), is essentially that of T. marmorata nAChR because the sequences of the four subunits differ between species only by 38 amino acid substitutions, including 16 in the transmembrane helices, without any insertions or deletions. CDOCKER was used to dock 50 energy-minimized structures of TDBzl-etomidate (volume, 284 Å3) into potential binding sites in the nAChR TMD defined by a sphere of 15-Å radius centered within the ion channel or of 12-Å radius centered at each of the five subunit interfaces or within the helical bundle of the δ subunit. The spheres within the ion channel and at the subunit interfaces extended from the level of M2-6 to M2-23, whereas for the δ subunit intrahelical bundle the sphere extended approximately from slightly below M2-13 and above M2-23. Because of the atom limitations of CDOCKER, the nAChR model was “trimmed” by removal of the M4 helices, the cytoplasmic extensions, and extracellular regions >14 Å above the membrane. Each set of 50 solutions was evaluated using CalculateBindingEnergies, and for visualization, each TDBzl-etomidate binding pocket was represented by the Connolly surface of the ensemble of the 10 docking solutions with the most favorable binding energies (Fig. 8 and supplemental Figs. S5 and S6). For the binding site in the channel, the 10 orientations were contained within a pocket of ∼900 Å3, extending from M2-9 to M2-23. For the binding site at the interface between γ and α subunits, the pocket had a volume of ∼580 Å3 and did not extend below M2-9. TDBzl-etomidate binding was also predicted within less constrained pockets at the β-α (∼1380 Å3), α-γ (∼890 Å3), and α-δ (1120 Å3) interfaces that were less well defined and extended into the ion channel and the lipid interface. No stable binding was predicted at the δ-β interface or within the δ subunit helix bundle. TDBzl-etomidate, a Positive Modulator of ACh Responses—We used two-electrode voltage clamp to compare the effects of TDBzl-etomidate and etomidate on the ACh current responses for Torpedo nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 2, A and B). Neither etomidate nor TDBzl-etomidate, when applied in the absence of agonist, produced any detectable current response (i.e. <0.1% of the maximal response for ACh). As reported previously (26Husain S.S. Ziebell M.R. Ruesch D. Hong F. Arevalo E. Kosterlitz J.A. Olsen R.W. Forman S.A. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), when coapplied in the presence of 10 μm ACh, a concentration producing ∼20% of the maximal response, etomidate produced a dose-dependent inhibition characterized by an IC50 of 20 μm. In contrast, TDBzl-etomidate at concentrations above 10 μm increased the ACh response with a 2.5-fold increase seen at the highest concentration studied (60 μm). At that concentration the methanol concentration was 0.05%, but in control experiments we established that methanol at 0.5% altered the ACh response by less than 5%. Consistent enhancement of the ACh response was seen when TDBzl-etomidate was applied in either increasing or decreasing concentrations, and the enhancement was fully reversible when the ACh response was measured minutes after removal of TDBzl-etomidate. We also measured the effects of TDBzl-etomidate on the equilibrium binding of [3H]ACh and drugs that bind in the ion channel preferentially in the resting state ([3H]tetracaine (35Middleton R.E. Strnad N.P. Cohen J.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 290-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)) or desensitized state ([3H]PCP (36Oswald R.E. Heidmann T. Changeux J.-P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3128-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 2C). When [3H]ACh equilibrium binding was measured at a concentration sufficient to occupy ∼20% of sites, TDBzl-etomidate increased binding by ∼20% at the highest concentration studied (300 μm). In the absence of agonist it inhibited [3H]tetracaine or [3H]PCP binding with an IC50 of 0.9 mm, and in the presence of agonist it inhibited [3H]PCP binding with an IC50 of 0.5 mm. Photoincorporation of [3H]TDBzl-etomidate into nAChR-rich Membranes—We used SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography (Fig. 3A) or liquid scintillation counting of excised gel bands (Fig. 3, B and C) to provide an initial characterization of the pattern and pharmacological specificity of nAChR subunit photolabeling. Membranes were photolabeled after equilibration with [3H]TDBzl-etomidate (0.8 μm) in the absence of other drugs or in the presence of the agonist Carb and/or drugs that bind in the ion channel preferentially in the desensitized state (proadifen (37Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4023-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) or PCP)"
https://openalex.org/W1977675901,"The study of the biology of evolution has been confined to laboratories and model organisms. However, controlled laboratory conditions are unlikely to model variations in environments that influence selection in wild populations. Thus, the study of “fitness” for survival and the genetics that influence this are best carried out in the field and in matching environments. Therefore, we studied highland populations in their native environments, to learn how they cope with ambient hypoxia. The Andeans, African highlanders and Himalayans have adapted differently to their hostile environment. Chronic mountain sickness (CMS), a loss of adaptation to altitude, is common in the Andes, occasionally found in the Himalayas; and absent from the East African altitude plateau. We compared molecular signatures (distinct patterns of gene expression) of hypoxia-related genes, in white blood cells (WBC) from Andeans with (n = 10), without CMS (n = 10) and sea-level controls from Lima (n = 20) with those obtained from CMS (n = 8) and controls (n = 5) Ladakhi subjects from the Tibetan altitude plateau. We further analyzed the expression of a subset of these genes in Ethiopian highlanders (n = 8). In all subjects, we performed the studies at their native altitude and after they were rendered normoxic. We identified a gene that predicted CMS in Andeans and Himalayans (PDP2). After achieving normoxia, WBC gene expression still distinguished Andean and Himalayan CMS subjects. Remarkably, analysis of the small subset of genes (n = 8) studied in all 3 highland populations showed normoxia induced gene expression changes in Andeans, but not in Ethiopians nor Himalayan controls. This is consistent with physiologic studies in which Ethiopians and Himalayans show a lack of responsiveness to hypoxia of the cerebral circulation and of the hypoxic ventilatory drive, and with the absence of CMS on the East African altitude plateau."
https://openalex.org/W1979938527,"DNA damage triggers a network of signaling events that leads to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. This DNA damage response acts as a mechanism to prevent cancer development. It has been reported that fatty acids (FAs) synthesis is increased in many human tumors while inhibition of fatty acid synthase (FASN) could suppress tumor growth. Here we report that saturated fatty acids (SFAs) play a negative role in DNA damage response. Palmitic acid, as well as stearic acid and myristic acid, compromised the induction of p21 and Bax expression in response to double stranded breaks and ssDNA, while inhibition or knockdown of FASN enhanced these cellular events. SFAs appeared to regulate p21 and Bax expression via Atr-p53 dependent and independent pathways. These effects were only observed in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and osteoblasts, but not in immortalized murine NIH3T3, or transformed HCT116 and MCF-7 cell lines. Accordingly, SFAs showed some positive effects on proliferation of MEFs in response to DNA damage. These results suggest that SFAs, by negatively regulating the DNA damage response pathway, might promote cell transformation, and that increased synthesis of SFAs in precancer/cancer cells might contribute to tumor progression and drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1973750030,"Cancer patients undergoing treatment with systemic cancer chemotherapy drugs often experience debilitating fatigue similar to sickness behavior, a normal response to infection or tissue damage caused by the production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6. The p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) plays a central role in the production of these cytokines and consequently the development of sickness behavior. Targeted inhibitors of p38 MAPK can reduce systemic inflammatory cytokine production and the development of sickness behavior. Several systemic cancer chemotherapy drugs have been shown to stimulate inflammatory cytokine production, yet whether this response is related to a common ability to activate p38 MAPK is not known and is the focus of this study. This understanding may present the possibility of using p38 MAPK inhibitors to reduce chemotherapy-induced inflammatory cytokine production and consequently treatment-related fatigue. One caveat of this approach is a potential reduction in chemotherapeutic efficacy as some believe that p38 MAPK activity is required for chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity of tumor cells. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate proof of principal that p38 MAPK inhibition can block chemotherapy- induced inflammatory cytokine production without inhibiting drug-induced cytotoxicity using murine peritoneal macrophages and Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC1) cells as model cell systems. Using these cells we assessed the requirement of etoposide, doxorubicin, 5-flourouracil, and docetaxel for p38 MAPK in inflammatory cytokine production and cytotoxicity. Study findings demonstrate that clinically relevant doses of etoposide, doxorubicin, and 5-FU activated p38 MAPK in both macrophages and LLC1 cells. In contrast, docetaxel failed to activate p38 MAPK in either cell type. Activation of p38 MAPK mediated the drug's effects on inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages but not LLC1 cytotoxicity and this was confirmed with inhibitor studies."
https://openalex.org/W2087375630,"Background The sequences of wild-isolate strains of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) are characterized by low GC content and suboptimal codon usage. Codon optimization of DNA vectors can enhance protein expression both by enhancing translational efficiency, and by altering RNA stability and export. Although gag codon optimization is widely used in DNA vectors and experimental vaccines, the actual effect of altered codon usage on gag translational efficiency has not been quantified. Methodology and Principal Findings To quantify translational efficiency of gag mRNA in live T cells, we transfected Jurkat cells with increasing doses of capped, polyadenylated synthetic mRNA corresponding to wildtype or codon-optimized gag sequences, measured Gag production by quantitative ELISA and flow cytometry, and estimated the translational efficiency of each transcript as pg of Gag antigen produced per µg of input mRNA. We found that codon optimization yielded a small increase in gag translational efficiency (approximately 1.6 fold). In contrast when cells were transfected with DNA vectors requiring nuclear transcription and processing of gag mRNA, codon optimization resulted in a very large enhancement of Gag production. Conclusions We conclude that suboptimal codon usage by HIV-1 results in only a slight loss of gag translational efficiency per se, with the vast majority of enhancement in protein expression from DNA vectors due to altered processing and export of nuclear RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2069296806,"Background The ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases are major contributors to malignant transformation. These receptors are frequently overexpressed in a variety of human carcinomas. The role of the ErbB receptors and their ligands in carcinomas and the mechanism by which their overexpression leads to cancer development is still unclear. Ligand binding to specific ErbB receptor is followed by receptor dimerization, phosphorylation and recruitment of SH2 containing cytoplasmic proteins, which initiate the cascade of signaling events. Nevertheless, increasing data suggest that there are non-phosphorylated receptor–substrate interactions that may affect ErbB-mediated responses. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, using GST-ErbB4 fusion protein pull down assay and mass spectroscopic analysis, we have found the ErbB receptors interact with nucleolin via their cytoplasmic tail. Nucleolin is a ubiquitous, nonhistone, nucleolar, multifunctional phosphoprotein that is also overexpressed in cancer cells. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of ErbB1 and nucleolin may lead to receptor dimerization, phosphorylation and to anchorage independent growth. Conclusions/Significance The oncogenic potential of ErbB depends on receptor levels and activation. Our results suggest that nucleolin may affect ErbB dimerization and activation leading to enhanced cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2086577064,"In order to establish cells and organisms with predictable properties, synthetic biology makes use of controllable, synthetic genetic devices. These devices are used to replace or to interfere with natural pathways. Alternatively, they may be interlinked with endogenous pathways to create artificial networks of higher complexity. While these approaches have been already successful in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, the implementation of such synthetic cassettes in mammalian systems and even animals is still a major obstacle. This is mainly due to the lack of methods that reliably and efficiently transduce synthetic modules without compromising their regulation properties. To pave the way for implementation of synthetic regulation modules in mammalian systems we utilized lentiviral transduction of synthetic modules. A synthetic positive feedback loop, based on the Tetracycline regulation system was implemented in a lentiviral vector system and stably integrated in mammalian cells. This gene regulation circuit yields a bimodal expression response. Based on experimental data a mathematical model based on stochasticity was developed which matched and described the experimental findings. Modelling predicted a hysteretic expression responsewhich was verified experimentally. Thereby supporting the idea that the system is driven by stochasticity. The results presented here highlight that the combination of three independent tools/methodologies facilitate the reliable installation of synthetic gene circuits with predictable expression characteristics in mammalian cells and organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1965000474,"Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT) is a highly aggressive malignancy that affects mainly adolescents and young adults. A defining characteristic of DSRCT is a specific chromosomal translocation, t(11;22)(p13;q12), that fuses EWS with WT1, leading to a production of two isoforms of chimeric transcription factor, EWS/WT1(-KTS) and EWS/WT1(+KTS). The chimeric proteins are thought to play critical roles in various stages of oncogenesis through aberrant transcription of different genes, but only a few of these genes have been identified.We report the identification of a new target of EWS/WT1, ENT4 (equilibrative nucleoside transporter 4) which encodes a pH-dependent adenosine transporter. ENT4 is transcriptionally activated by both isoforms of EWS/WT1 as evidenced by promoter-reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses. Furthermore, ENT4 is highly and specifically expressed in primary tumors of DSRCT as well as in a DSRCT cell line, JN-DSRCT-1. Treatment of JN-DSRCT-1 cells with adenosine analogs, such as 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (2-CdA), resulted in an increased cytotoxic response in dose- and pH-dependent manner.Our detailed analyses of a novel target of EWS/WT1 in DSRCT reveal an insight into the oncogenic mechanism of EWS-fusion chromosomal translocation gene products and provide a new marker for DSRCT. Furthermore, identification of ENT4 as a highly expressed transcript in DSRCT may represent an attractive pathway for targeting chemotherapeutic drugs into DSRCT."
https://openalex.org/W1987285458,"In the past decades, chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, asthma, Crohn’s disease and celiac disease were generally regarded as immune-mediated conditions involving activated T-cells and proinflammatory cytokines produced by these cells. This paradigm has recently been challenged by the finding that mutations and polymorphisms in epithelium-expressed genes involved in physical barrier function or innate immunity, are risk factors of these conditions. We used a functional genomics approach to analyze cultured keratinocytes from patients with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis and healthy controls. First passage primary cells derived from non-lesional skin were stimulated with pro-inflammatory cytokines, and expression of a panel of 55 genes associated with epidermal differentiation and cutaneous inflammation was measured by quantitative PCR. A subset of these genes was analyzed at the protein level. Using cluster analysis and multivariate analysis of variance we identified groups of genes that were differentially expressed, and could, depending on the stimulus, provide a disease-specific gene expression signature. We found particularly large differences in expression levels of innate immunity genes between keratinocytes from psoriasis patients and atopic dermatitis patients. Our findings indicate that cell-autonomous differences exist between cultured keratinocytes of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients, which we interpret to be genetically determined. We hypothesize that polymorphisms of innate immunity genes both with signaling and effector functions are coadapted, each with balancing advantages and disadvantages. In the case of psoriasis, high expression levels of antimicrobial proteins genes putatively confer increased protection against microbial infection, but the biological cost could be a beneficial system gone awry, leading to overt inflammatory disease."
https://openalex.org/W2012421610,"Matrix metalloproteinase-19 (MMP19) affects cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration in vitro but its physiological role in vivo is poorly understood. To determine the function of MMP19, we generated mice deficient for MMP19 by disrupting the catalytic domain of mmp19 gene. Although MMP19-deficient mice do not show overt developmental and morphological abnormalities they display a distinct physiological phenotype. In a model of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) MMP19-deficient mice showed impaired T cell-mediated immune reaction that was characterized by limited influx of inflammatory cells, low proliferation of keratinocytes, and reduced number of activated CD8(+) T cells in draining lymph nodes. In the inflamed tissue, the low number of CD8(+) T cells in MMP19-deficient mice correlated with low amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, especially lymphotactin and interferon-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC). Further analyses showed that T cell populations in the blood of immature, unsensitized mice were diminished and that this alteration originated from an altered maturation of thymocytes. In the thymus, thymocytes exhibited low proliferation rates and the number of CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive cells was remarkably augmented. Based on the phenotype of MMP19-deficient mice we propose that MMP19 is an important factor in cutaneous immune responses and influences the development of T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1981031399,"Hyperpredation refers to an enhanced predation pressure on a secondary prey due to either an increase in the abundance of a predator population or a sudden drop in the abundance of the main prey. This scarcely documented mechanism has been previously studied in scenarios in which the introduction of a feral prey caused overexploitation of native prey. Here we provide evidence of a previously unreported link between Emergent Infectious Diseases (EIDs) and hyperpredation on a predator-prey community. We show how a viral outbreak caused the population collapse of a host prey at a large spatial scale, which subsequently promoted higher-than-normal predation intensity on a second prey from shared predators. Thus, the disease left a population dynamic fingerprint both in the primary host prey, through direct mortality from the disease, and indirectly in the secondary prey, through hyperpredation. This resulted in synchronized prey population dynamics at a large spatio-temporal scale. We therefore provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which EIDs can disrupt a predator-prey interaction from the individual behavior to the population dynamics. This mechanism can pose a further threat to biodiversity through the human-aided disruption of ecological interactions at large spatial and temporal scales."
https://openalex.org/W1981326970,"Programmed DNA elimination and reorganization frequently occur during cellular differentiation. Development of the somatic macronucleus in some ciliates presents an extreme case, involving excision of internal eliminated sequences (IESs) that interrupt coding DNA segments (macronuclear destined sequences, MDSs), as well as removal of transposon-like elements and extensive genome fragmentation, leading to 98% genome reduction in Stylonychia lemnae. Approximately 20-30% of the genes are estimated to be scrambled in the germline micronucleus, with coding segment order permuted and present in either orientation on micronuclear chromosomes. Massive genome rearrangements are therefore critical for development.To understand the process of DNA deletion and reorganization during macronuclear development, we examined the population of DNA molecules during assembly of different scrambled genes in two related organisms in a developmental time-course by PCR. The data suggest that removal of conventional IESs usually occurs first, accompanied by a surprising level of error at this step. The complex events of inversion and translocation seem to occur after repair and excision of all conventional IESs and via multiple pathways.This study reveals a temporal order of DNA rearrangements during the processing of a scrambled gene, with simpler events usually preceding more complex ones. The surprising observation of a hidden layer of errors, absent from the mature macronucleus but present during development, also underscores the need for repair or screening of incorrectly-assembled DNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1997593589,"Synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2) is required for normal calcium-regulated secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters. Neurons lacking the two most widely expressed isoforms, SV2A and SV2B, have a reduced readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles, indicating that SV2 contributes to vesicle priming. The presence of putative ATP-binding sites in SV2 suggested that SV2 might be an ATP-binding protein. To explore this, we examined the binding of the photoaffinity reagent 8-azido-ATP[gamma] biotin to purified, recombinant SV2 in the presence and absence of other nucleotides. Our results indicate that SV2A and SV2B bind nucleotides, with the highest affinity for adenine-containing nucleotides. SV2A contains two binding sites located in the cytoplasmic domains preceding the first and seventh transmembrane domains. These results suggest that SV2-mediated vesicle priming could be regulated by adenine nucleotides, which might provide a link between cellular energy levels and regulated secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1999530281,"Congenital prosopagnosia is a severe face perception impairment which is not acquired by a brain lesion and is presumably present from birth. It manifests mostly by an inability to recognise familiar persons. Electrophysiological research has demonstrated the relevance to face processing of a negative deflection peaking around 170 ms, labelled accordingly as N170 in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and M170 in magnetoencephalography (MEG). The M170 was shown to be sensitive to the inversion of faces and to familiarity--two factors that are assumed to be crucial for congenital prosopagnosia. In order to locate the cognitive dysfunction and its neural correlates, we investigated the time course of neural activity in response to these manipulations.Seven individuals with congenital prosopagnosia and seven matched controls participated in the experiment. To explore brain activity with high accuracy in time, we recorded evoked magnetic fields (275 channel whole head MEG) while participants were looking at faces differing in familiarity (famous vs. unknown) and orientation (upright vs. inverted). The underlying neural sources were estimated by means of the least square minimum-norm-estimation (L2-MNE) approach.The behavioural data corroborate earlier findings on impaired configural processing in congenital prosopagnosia. For the M170, the overall results replicated earlier findings, with larger occipito-temporal brain responses to inverted than upright faces, and more right- than left-hemispheric activity. Compared to controls, participants with congenital prosopagnosia displayed a general decrease in brain activity, primarily over left occipitotemporal areas. This attenuation did not interact with familiarity or orientation.The study substantiates the finding of an early involvement of the left hemisphere in symptoms of prosopagnosia. This might be related to an efficient and overused featural processing strategy which serves as a compensation of impaired configural processing."
https://openalex.org/W2082364696,"The BCL6 oncogenic transcriptional repressor is required for development of germinal center centroblasts, which undergo simultaneous genetic recombination and massive clonal expansion. Although BCL6 is required for survival of centroblasts, its expression in earlier B-cells is toxic. Understanding these opposing effects could provide critical insight into normal B-cell biology and lymphomagenesis. We examined the transcriptional and biological effects of BCL6 in various primary cells. BCL6 repression of ATR was previously shown to play a critical role in the centroblast phenotype. Likewise, we found that BCL6 could impose an ATR-dependent phenotype of attenuated DNA damage sensing and repair in primary fibroblasts and B-cells. BCL6 induced true genomic instability because DNA repair was delayed and was qualitatively impaired, which could be critical for BCL6-induced lymphomagenesis. Although BCL6 can directly repress TP53 in centroblasts, BCL6 induced TP53 expression in primary fibroblasts and B-cells, and these cells underwent p53-dependent growth arrest and senescence in the presence of physiological levels of BCL6. This differential ability to trigger a functional p53 response explains at least in part the different biological response to BCL6 expression in centroblasts versus other cells. The data suggest that targeted re-activation of TP53 could be of therapeutic value in centroblast-derived lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W1982038426,"Airway smooth muscle is richly endowed with muscarinic receptors of the M2 and M3 subtype. Stimulation of these receptors inhibits large conductance calcium-activated K+ (BK) channels, a negative feed back regulator, in a pertussis toxinsensitive manner and thus facilitates contraction. The underlying mechanism, however, is unknown. We therefore studied the activity of bovine trachea BK channels in HEK293 cells expressing the M2 or M3 receptor (M2RorM3R). In M2R- but not M3R-expressing cells, maximal effective concentrations of carbamoylcholine (CCh) inhibited whole cell BK currents by 53%. This M2R-induced inhibition was abolished by pertussis toxin treatment or overexpression of the Gβγ scavenger transducin-α. In inside-out patches, direct application of 300 nm purified Gβγ decreased channel open probability by 55%. The physical interaction of Gβγ with BK channels was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, inhibition of phospholipase C as well as protein kinase C activities also reversed the CCh effect but to a smaller (∼20%) extent. Mouse tracheal cells responded similarly to CCh, purified Gβγ and phospholipase C/protein kinase C inhibition as M2R-expressing HEK293 cells.

The neurotransmitter acetylcholine exerts its effects by binding to muscarinic receptors of which five subtypes (M1-M5) have been identified. All are members of the heptahelical family of G protein-coupled receptors (1Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R.

On mammalian ASM, the M2 (M2R) and M3 (M3R) receptor subtypes are expressed with M2R representing the larger population (4Mak J.C. Barnes P.J. Am. Rev. Respir.

Additionally, M4 receptors (M4R) are present in rabbit small airways and parenchyma (4Mak J.C. Barnes P.J. Am. Rev. Respir.

Life Sci. 1993; 53: 1501-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but their function remains unknown. M3Rs in ASM are coupled to phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway via pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive G proteins of the Gq/11 family. The contractile response evoked by M3R stimulation is attributed to the formation of inositol trisphosphate (IP3), the subsequent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, the additional influx of extracellular calcium, and the Ca2+-sensitizing effect of PKC (7Grandordy B.M.

Stimulation of M2 muscarinic receptors (M2Rs) in ASM inhibits adenylyl cyclase via activation of PTX-sensitive G proteins of the Gi/o family (12Jones C.A. Madison J.M. Tom-Moy M. Brown J.K. Am. J.

Dis. 1988; 138: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and therefore M2Rs are thought to counteract relaxation that requires activation of adenylyl cyclase, as for example the β2-adrenoreceptor agonist-induced ASM relaxation (14Fernandes L.B. Fryer A.D. Hirshman C.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 262: 119-126PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, however, evidence has been provided that M2Rs participate directly in ASM contraction. In mice with a targeted deletion of the M2R, the muscarinic receptor agonist carbamoylcholine (CCh) induced less ASM contraction than in the wild-type littermates (15Stengel P.W. Gomeza J. Wess J. Cohen M.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 877-885PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in mice deleted of the M3R contractile responses in ASM to CCh still occur (16Stengel P.W. Yamada M. Wess J. Cohen M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: R1443-R1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the M2Rs in ASM induce contraction is, however, still unknown. In isolated guinea pig tracheal strips, methacholine-induced contractions involved activation of PTX-sensitive Gi/o proteins and required the activity of large conductance, Ca2+-activated potassium channels (BK channels) (17Kume H. Mikawa K. Takagi K. Kotlikoff M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L221-L229PubMed Google Scholar). Because BK channels function as a rheostat, limiting Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels by shifting the membrane potential to more inside-negative values (18Nelson M.T. Cheng H. Rubart M. Santana L.F. Bonev A.D. Knot H.J. Lederer W.J. Science. 1995; 270: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 19Jaggar J.H. Porter V.A. Lederer W.J. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C235-C256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is conceivable that inhibition of BK channel activity favors contraction. By using the heterologous expression system of HEK293 cells and native tracheal cells, we show herein that Gβγ subunits released from Gi/o proteins upon stimulation of M2 muscarinic receptors inhibit BK channels by a dual mechanism. First, they directly bind to the BK channel pore-forming α subunit or an associated protein and inhibit the open probability. Second, they activate the PLC/PKC pathway, thereby contributing to PKC-dependent BK channel inhibition.

Transducin (TD) was eluted from the membranes by hypotonic elution in the presence of 100 μm GTP, and the subunits were separated by affinity chromatography on Blue Sepharose (Bio-Rad). The buffers in which the proteins were eluted from the columns were changed to the intracellular pipette solution (see below) by repeated extensive dialysis, and the proteins were stored in aliquots at -80 °C.

All other HEK293 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with Earle's salts medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units ml-1 penicillin, and 100 μg ml-1 streptomycin. HEK293 cells were cultured for 24 h and then transiently transfected with the DNA plasmids by calcium phosphate precipitation for 18 h at 35 °C and 3% CO2. After washing, the cells were cultivated for another 48–72 h at 37 °C and 6% CO2. After the medium was exchanged several times with PSS (see below), the cells were transferred in a 35-mm dish to the stage of an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200) for electrophysiological measurements. The transfection efficiency varied between 40 and 70%. Animals and Cell Preparation—All of the experimental procedures were carried out according to the animal welfare guidelines of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. C57BL/6 mice of either sex were obtained from a colony bred and maintained at the animal house of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. The tracheae were dissected from mice killed by CO2. After the connective tissue was removed, the tissue was cut with a sharp blade into pieces of ∼1 mm side length and incubated under gentle agitation at 37 °C in Ca2+-free PSS including 0.7 mg ml-1 papain, 1 mg ml-1 1,4-dithio-d,l-threitol, and 1 mg ml-1 fat-free bovine serum albumin. The tissue pieces were transferred 30 min later into PSS containing 50 μm Ca2+, 1 mg ml-1 collagenase, 1 mg ml-1 hyaluronidase, and 1 mg ml-1 albumin and digested for another 8–10 min at 37 °C. Single cells were released by gentle trituration of the digested tissue using a narrow-bore, fire-polished Pasteur pipette and stored in PSS at room temperature. After isolation, >50% of the cells were relaxed, and only these cells were used for the electrophysiological studies. The experiments were conducted within 6 h of cell isolation. A small aliquot of the solution containing the isolated cells was placed in an open perfusion chamber (1 ml) mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200). The myocytes were allowed to adhere to the bottom of the chamber for 5–10 min and were then superfused at 2–3 ml min-1 with PSS at room temperature. Recording Techniques—Standard patch clamp recording techniques were used to measure currents in the cell-attached, inside-out, or whole cell patch clamp configuration (24Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar). Patch electrodes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (MTW 150F; World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) and filled with prefiltered solutions of different composition (see below). The currents were recorded at room temperature with an EPC-7 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany), connected via a 16-bit A/D interface to a pentium IBM clone computer. The signals were low pass filtered (1 kHz) before 5 kHz digitization. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with an ISO-3 multitasking patch clamp program (MFK M. Friedrich, Niedernhausen, Germany). Pipette resistance ranged from 2 to 3 MΩ in whole cell experiments and from 8 to 9 MΩ in the excised patch experiments. The amplitude of single-channel currents was derived from an amplitude distribution histogram. Determination of the average channel open probability (NPo) in patches has been described elsewhere (25Zhou X.-B. Ruth P. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Korth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19760-19767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). After the patch had been equilibrated for at least 5 min, the drugs were superfused for another 3–5 min before the mean NPo was determined. A multi-barreled perfusion pipette placed 200 μm away from the patch was used to switch the superfusion solution. The holding potential in the whole cell patch clamp experiments was -10 mV. Solutions—The bath was superfused with PSS containing 127 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 2.4 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 11 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. For whole cell experiments the pipette solution contained 126 mm KCl, 6 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 11 mm glucose, 3 mm dipotassium ATP, 0.1 mm Na3GTP, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH. The free Ca2+ concentration was adjusted to 0.3 μm by adding the appropriate amount of CaCl2 as described earlier (25Zhou X.-B. Ruth P. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Korth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19760-19767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In some experiments the Ca2+ concentration was increased to 3 μm. Free Ca2+ was checked by fura 2-fluorescence. For inside-out experiments, the extracellular (pipette) solution contained 132 mm KCl, 6 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 11 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with KOH, and the bath solution (cytosolic surface of the patch) contained 126 mm KCl, 6 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 11 mm glucose, 3 mm dipotassium ATP, 0.1 mm Na3GTP, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with KOH. The free Ca2+ concentration was 0.3 μm, and in some experiments it was 1 μm. For the measurement of GIRK currents, whole cell recordings were used with a bath solution containing 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, adjusted with NaOH. The internal (pipette) solution contained 100 mm potassium aspartate, 40 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MgATP, 0.1 mm Na3GTP, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH. Co-immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells were seeded in 10-cm culture dishes and transfected with 4 μg of pcDNA3.2-BK channel α subunit, 4 μg of pcDNA6/His-Gβ1IRESγ2 (kind gift of Dr. H. J. Hippe, Heidelberg, Germany), or a combination of both and up to 8 μg of an empty pcDNA control vector. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were lysed with 1000 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and homogenized for 30 s. After centrifugation (26,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), 40 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) was added for preclearing the lysates. The lysates were separated from protein A-Sepharose, and then 4 μg of anti-His6-antibody (Qiagen) was added to each sample and incubated for 30 min on ice. After the addition of 40 μl equilibrated protein A-Sepharose, the samples were gently shaken for 4 h at 4 °C. Then the Sepharose beads were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 25 μl of sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. The precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblot with an anti-Gβcom (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or an anti-BK channel α subunit antibody (26Steffens F. Zhou X.-B. Sausbier U. Sailer C. Motejlek K. Ruth P. Olcese J. Korth M. Wieland T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2103-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (1:500 dilution). Data Analysis—SigmaPlot for windows (Jandel Scientific, version 8) was used for statistical analyses. Significance was determined by paired or unpaired t test or by one-way analysis of variance. When a significant effect was detected with analysis of variance, Student's t test was used for pairwise comparisons. The effects were deemed significant when a p < 0.05 was obtained. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. where applicable. Gβγ Subunits Mediate BK Channel Inhibition by M2 and M4 Receptor Activation—A PTX-sensitive inhibitory effect of muscarinic receptor stimulation on BK channel activity has been demonstrated in ASM cells at the single channel level (27Kume H. Kotlikoff M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C1204-C1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kume H. Graziano M.P. Kotlikoff M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11051-11055Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). When we elicited whole cell outward currents (Iout) in smooth muscle cells freshly isolated from the mouse trachea (TSMCs) from a holding potential of -10 mV by depolarizing the cells every 5 s for 300 ms from -60 to +80 mV, addition of the specific BK channel inhibiting peptide iberiotoxin (300 nm) revealed that more than 90% of Iout was generated by BK channels (data not shown). The addition of a maximal effective concentration of CCh (10 μm) decreased current densities at all voltages by ∼50% (current densities at +80 mV: control, 135.5 ± 9.2; CCh, 66.7 ± 10.7 pA pF-1, p < 0.01, n = 8). In accordance with the data reported by Kume et al. (27Kume H. Kotlikoff M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C1204-C1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kume H. Graziano M.P. Kotlikoff M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11051-11055Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the inhibitory effect of CCh was completely abolished when TSMCs were exposed to PTX 5 h prior to CCh application. To dissect the effects induced via M2Rs and M3Rs, we transiently expressed the pore-forming BK channel α subunits (KCNMA1) cloned from bovine trachea in HEK293 cells stably expressing the human M2R (21Sandmann J. Peralta E.G. Wurtman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6031-6034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell outward currents were then elicited as described above (Fig. 1A). In HEK293 cells not expressing BK channels, a negligible endogenous outward current was obtained which amounted to less than 2% (at + 80 mV) of the current elicited in transfected cells (data not shown). We therefore consider outward currents in transfected HEK293 cells exclusively as BK currents (IBK). As observed in TSMCs, 10 μm CCh suppressed IBK at all voltages by ∼50% (Fig. 1, A and D), and this inhibition was completely abolished when HEK293 cells were exposed to 500 ng ml-1 PTX 5 h prior to CCh application (Fig. 1, B and D). Because this finding indicates that Gi/o proteins also mediate the CCh-induced inhibition of BK channel currents in HEK293 cells, we set up experiments to characterize which subunit of Gi/o is responsible for channel inhibition. We therefore co-expressed the BK channel α subunit and TDα, the Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein that mediates signal transduction in vertebrate photoreceptor cells. TDα has been shown to act as a scavenger of Gβγ dimers dissociated from heterotrimeric Gi/o proteins (29Federmann A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and thus specifically antagonizes Gβγ-mediated effects, whereas Gαi/o actions are preserved (30Zhou X.-B. Wang G.-X. Hüneke B. Wieland T. Korth M. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31Zhou X.-B. Lutz S. Steffens F. Korth M. Wieland T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 740-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 (C and D), CCh completely lost its inhibitory effect on BK channel current in TDα-overexpressing cells. When HEK293 cells expressing the M3R and the BK channel α subunit were exposed to 10 μm CCh by utilizing the same experimental protocol, no steady-state inhibition of IBK was obtained (Fig. 2A). Together the findings indicate that the Gi/o-coupled M2R, but not the preferentially Gq/11-coupled M3R (32Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar), is linked to BK channel inhibition via Gβγ dimers. We therefore tested whether the second Gi/o-coupled muscarinic receptor, i.e. the M4R, or stimulation of Gi/o-coupled receptors of different subfamilies can also inhibit steady-state IBK. Whole cell patch clamp experiments in M4R- or α2A-AR-expressing cells revealed that application of 10 μm CCh to the M4R-expressing cells resulted in a significant, approximately 35% decrease of the BK channel current, whereas noradrenaline (10 μm) was ineffective in α2A-AR-expressing cells (Fig. 2, B–D). To confirm that α2A-ARs expressed in HEK293 cells effectively couple to Gi/o proteins, we transiently transfected these cells and, for comparison, also the cells expressing M2R and M4R, with the G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunits GIRK1 and GIRK4. Because functional GIRK channels are activated by Gβγ dimers (33Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), their activation indicates the agonist-induced release of Gβγ from Gi/o. Agonist-activated currents were measured as inwardly directed K+ currents generated in the whole cell configuration by 300-ms hyperpolarizing pulses from a holding potential of -10 to -90 mV (20 mm external K+). Application of 10 μm noradrenaline and 10 μm CCh induced large currents in the cells expressing the α2A-AR or one of the two muscarinic receptors, respectively (Fig. 3). Interestingly, stimulation of α2A-ARs with noradrenaline generated a significantly larger GIRK current than CCh in M4R- or M2R-expressing cells. Taken together, the results show that all three Gi/o-coupled receptors effectively release Gβγ subunits, but only Gβγ released by activation of Gi/o-coupled muscarinic receptors induces BK channel inhibition. Gβγ dimers regulate the activity of some ion channels such as the GIRK and neuronal voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels by direct interaction (34De Waard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E.S. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), whereas other effects require stimulation of Gβγ-dependent effector enzymes like PLCβ isoforms (35Camps M. Carozzi A. Schnabel P. Scheer A. Parker P.J. Gierschik P. Nature. 1992; 360: 684-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 36Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and the subsequent activation of PKC. We therefore set up experiments to analyze the possible contribution of direct and indirect Gβγ-mediated effects to BK channel inhibition.FIGURE 2Stimulation of M4Rs but not of M3Rs and α2A-ARs are linked to BK channel inhibition. Whole cell BK outward currents (IBK) were elicited in HEK293 cells transfected with either the M3R(A), the M4R(B), or the α2A-AR (C) and the BK channel α subunit. A–C, original current traces from three representative cells depolarized every 5 s for 300 ms from -60 to +80 mV in 10-mV increments. Holding potential was -10 mV.

In the presence of symmetrically high potassium (140 mm) and at a holding potential of +60 mV, the cytosolic surface of an inside-out patch was sequentially superfused with purified G protein subunits either alone or in combination (Fig. 4, A and B). When 1 μm TDα was applied first as a negative control, channel open probability (NPo) did not change. Instead, NPo rapidly decreased from 0.67 to 0.39 when the superfusion solution contained 300 nm TDβγ. The effect of Gβγ was restricted to BK channel open probability, and the single channel conductance remained unchanged. The inhibitory effect of TDβγ was stable as long as the G protein was present but returned to the control level (0.74) when 1 μm TDα as scavenger was additionally applied. When the effect of 300 nm TDβγ alone was evaluated in 15 patches, a decrease of NPo by 55.3 ± 5.3% was obtained (Fig. 4C). This decrease was not significantly altered by increasing the Ca2+ concentration of the intracellular (bath) solution to 1 μm (inhibition by 51.7 ± 5.7%, n = 6) or by expressing the regulatory β1-subunit of the BK channel together with BKα (inhibition by TDβγ: 53.4 ± 4.4%, n = 9). The experiments presented so far, do not exclude the possibility that PLCβ isozyme(s) sensitive to activation by Gβγ dimers and present in inside-out patches may have mediated TDβγ-induced inhibition of NPo. Inside-out patches were therefore superfused for 10 min with the PLC inhibitor U-73122 (2.5 μm) first and then additionally with 300 nm TDβγ. The"
https://openalex.org/W2061873110,"Gene duplication is a characteristic feature of eukaryotic genomes. Here we investigated the role of gene duplication in the evolution of the gloverin family of antibacterial genes (Bmglv1, Bmglv2, Bmglv3, and Bmglv4) in Bombyx mori. We observed the following two significant changes during the first duplication event: (i) loss of intronV, located in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the ancestral gene Bmglv1, and (ii) 12-bp deletion in exon3. We show that loss of intronV during Bmglv1 to Bmglv2 duplication was associated with embryonic expression of Bmglv2. Gel mobility shift, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and immunodepletion assays identified chorion factor 2, a zinc finger protein, as the repressor molecule that bound to a 10-bp regulatory motif in intronV of Bmglv1 and repressed its transcription. gloverin paralogs that lacked intronV were independent of chorion factor 2 regulation and expressed in embryo. These results suggest that change in cis-regulation because of intron loss resulted in embryonic expression of Bmglv2-4, a gain of function over Bmglv1. Studies on the significance of intron loss have focused on introns present within the coding sequences for their potential effect on the open reading frame, whereas introns present in the UTRs of the genes were not given due attention. This study emphasizes the regulatory function of the 3′-UTR intron. In addition, we also studied the genomic loss and show that “in-frame” deletion of 12 nucleotides led to loss of amino acids IHDF resulting in the generation of a prepro-processing site in BmGlv2. As a result, the N-terminal pro-part of BmGlv2, but not of BmGlv1, gets processed in an infection-dependent manner suggesting that prepro-processing is an evolved feature in Gloverins.

Hultmark D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Cecropins, attacins, drosocins, and diptericins have antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, whereas defensins and metchnikowin kill Gram-positive bacteria (2Boman H.G. Hultmark D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 3Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). Specificity in the immune response against a particular class of microbes is because of specific interaction between pathogen-associated molecular patterns present on the microbes and pathogen recognition receptors of the insect (1Hoffmann J.A.

Because of the polyvalent recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, any microbial infection leads to production of the same battery of AMPs through two evolutionarily conserved pathways toll or imd (1Hoffmann J.A.

The Toll and IMD pathways mediate regulation of innate immune response in insects, in response to fungal and bacterial infections, respectively (1Hoffmann J.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 4Lemaitre B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Dorsal was the first transcription factor to be identified as regulator of innate immunity in Drosophila. Ip (5Ip Y.T. Cell. 1993; 75: 753-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) identified Dif (Dorsal related immunity factor), a second Drosophila Rel protein, in the larval fat body. Drosophila Rel proteins are found in the cytoplasm but are translocated to the nucleus upon activation of the immune pathway in a signal-dependent manner. An extracellular signal, encoded by the spatzle gene, binds to Toll, a membrane-bound receptor. Spatzle binding to Toll causes activation of a signal cascade involving Tube and Pelle, a serine/threonine kinase. This leads to phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of Cactus, an IkB homolog (1Hoffmann J.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 4Lemaitre B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the absence of Cactus, Dorsal and DIF are free to translocate to the nucleus, where they act as transcription factors and initiate expression of AMP genes. A third Rel factor, Relish, was isolated in a molecular screen for genes whose expression is altered after infection (6Dushay M.S. Asling B. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10343-10347Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Relish is a compound protein containing both Rel (activating) and IkB (inhibitory) domains (7Hedengren M. Asling B. Dushay M.S. Ando I. Ekengren S. Wihlborg M. Hultmark D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 827-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Upon infection, the Relish inhibitory domain is proteolytically cleaved by dredd, a Drosophila caspase, to release the active Rel protein (8Leulier F. Rodriguez A. Khush R.S. Abrams J.M. Lemaitre B. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Genetic epistasis studies and molecular analysis of gene function show that imd, Relish components of a signaling pathway are distinct from the Toll pathway and are essential for combating Gram-negative bacterial infection (8Leulier F.

Science. 1990; 250: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), has been reported only from lepidopteran insects. This prompted us to look for Lepidoptera-specific AMPs in Bombyx mori with a broader aim to understand the evolution of immune system in insects. B. mori is the only lepidopteran insect for which whole genome sequence (17Mita K. Kasahara M. Sasaki S. Nagayasu Y. Yamada T. Kanamori H. Namiki N. Kitagawa M. Yamashita H. Yasukochi Y.

An analysis of B. mori genome and EST sequence revealed the presence of AMPs like cecropins, moricins, attacins, lebocin, enbocin, hemolin, and gloverins. Our analysis, based on sequence information available currently, suggests that like hemolin gloverins are also restricted to lepidopteran insects. Gloverins are glycine-rich (16-20%) antibacterial proteins and have been reported from lepidopteran insects Hyalophora gloveri, Helicoverpa armigera, and Trichoplusia ni (20Axen A. Carlsson A. Engstrom A. Bennich H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Mackintosh J.A. Gooley A.A. Karuso P.H. Beattie A.J. Jardine D.R. Veal D.A. Dev. Comp.

They are basic, heat-stable proteins with random coil structure in solution and take α-helical structure upon interaction with lipopolysaccharide (20Axen A. Carlsson A. Engstrom A. Bennich H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We found that silkworm has four gloverin genes (Bmglv1, Bmglv2, Bmglv3, and Bmglv4). The derived genes Bmglv2-4 have evolved as a result of three gene duplication events. A significant difference was observed in the embryonic expression profile of these genes, whereas, derived genes Bmglv2-4 express in all embryonic stages but not the ancestral gene Bmglv1. This suggested that embryonic expression of derived genes was gained during duplication of Bmglv1. Embryonic regulation of AMP genes is not well studied; hence we set out to study the genetic changes that led to evolution of embryonic expression in the Lepidoptera-specific AMP gene family, gloverin. Molecular analysis suggested that embryonic expression of Bmglv1 was regulated by an intron present in the 3′ UTR of the gene. Further characterization of the regulatory role of intronV led to identification of CF2, a zinc finger transcription factor that regulates oogenesis as suppressor of Bmglv1 in the embryo. We also tested the significance of embryonic expression of daughter gene Bmglv2, by RNAi which led to reduced hatching of embryos. This indicated that Bmglv2 has a role in embryonic development. We show that this gain of function in embryonic development was linked to loss of intronV. Introns, noncoding sequences interrupting protein-coding genes, are the hallmark of eukaryotic gene organization (23Lynch M. Conery J.S. Science. 2003; 302: 1401-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). However, the role of intron in AMP gene regulation was previously not known. This is the first study demonstrating the regulatory role of an intron in an AMP gene and association between intron loss and gain of function. This study also emphasizes evolution of functional divergence in AMP gene paralogs. Animals—B. mori strains Pure Mysore and Nistari were collected from the sericulture station at Hindupur, Andhra Pradesh, India. Escherichia coli (K12 strain), cultured in antibiotic free LB media, was used for infecting silkworm larvae. Gel Shift Assay (EMSA)—Embryonic nuclear extracts were prepared by homogenizing embryos (40-72 h AEL) in extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 12.5% sucrose, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture) using a Dounce homogenizer, followed by centrifugation at 3300 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The precipitated nuclei were suspended in 1 ml of the extraction buffer. Embryonic extracts were also prepared from w1118 and Df(2L)γ27 flies (these flies lack the cf2 locus). For EMSA, 100 ng of double-stranded cf2 oligonucleotide (AGTAAATATATATATTTAAA) was labeled with 3 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (4 × 105cpm) and 1 μl of polynucleotide kinase (10 units/μl) in 1 μl of PNK buffer (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C. The labeled DNA was purified on a G-50 column. The binding reaction was performed for 30 min at room temperature by mixing 1 ng of purified 32P-labeled double strand synthetic oligonucleotide probe (4000 cpm/μl), 10 μg of nuclear extracts, 300 ng of poly(dI-dC), and 5 mm Zn2+ in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cold competition was performed by preincubating the extracts with a 40-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide at room temperature for 15 min. Anti-CF2 monoclonal antibody was added to the binding reaction for 30 min to perform supershift experiments. The binding reaction was analyzed by electrophoresis on native 6% polyacrylamide gels. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—In vitro transcription was done essentially as mentioned in Suzuki et al. (24Suzuki Y. Tsuda M. Takiya S. Hirose S. Suzuki M. Kameda M. Ninaki O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9522-9526Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Sakurai H. Susumu I. Tomino S. Martin J.T. In Vitro Transcription and Translation Protocols (Methods in Molecular Biology). Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1995: 233-244Google Scholar). For in vitro translation, different expression constructs were incubated with embryonic extracts prepared from Drosophila or silkworm embryos. Embryos were collected, dechorionated by bleaching, washed 3-5 times with 0.1% Triton X-100, and transferred to hypotonic buffer at 4 °C. Embryos were further washed in 3-5 volumes of cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 15 mm KCl, 1.5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm DTT) on ice. Next, embryos were Dounce-homogenized, and homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged again under the same conditions to remove any residual debris. Extracts were centrifuged through Sephadex G-25 Superfine columns prepared in buffer A (30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture). The column was transferred to a fresh collection tube to which a volume of cold buffer A equal to the extract volume was added, and the column was centrifuged for 3 min at 200 × g at 4 °C. 100 μl of eluate was applied to a P6 (Bio-Rad) desalting column to remove salt and other contaminants, and the desalted eluate was used for in vitro translation as mentioned in Gebauer et al. (26Gebauer F. Corona D.F.V. Preiss T. Becker P.B. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6146-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Entire protocol was first standardized with CantonS Drosophila embryonic extracts (data not shown), and then the standardized protocol was used for experiments with B. mori embryonic extracts. B. mori embryos were collected 40 and 56 h AEL and pooled. Immunodepletion of Embryonic CF2—Immunodepletion was done largely following the protocol as described previously (27Lanoix J. Ouwendijk J. Lin C.C. Stark A. Love H.D. Ostermann J. Nilsson T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4935-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Immunodepletion of CF2 was performed in embryonic extracts in a final volume of 500 μl of buffer A. CF2-depleted supernatant was collected and used immediately for in vitro translation. Western Blotting—In vitro translation reaction product was separated on a 10% minigel SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). Protein samples separated by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred using a Trans-blot cell (Bio-Rad), at 200 mA overnight at 4 °C to Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were stained for total protein by Ponceau S (Sigma) and blocked in 10% non-fat dry milk in 0.5% Tween 20, 0.05% SDS in PBS (Blocking buffer). The blots were incubated for 6 h at room temperature in primary antibodies and then washed four times (10 min each) in Tween 20 + PBS followed by a 2-h incubation at room temperature with the secondary antibody (Sigma). The blots were then washed three times for 30 min in Tween 20 + PBS and rinsed once in PBS. The protein bands were detected using horseradish peroxidase-enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-CF2 (mouse) and anti-GST (rabbit) antibodies were used in 1:10,000 and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively, for probing. RT-PCR, in Vitro Transcription, and RNAi—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), dissolved in 50 μl of RNase-free water, and quantified in a spectrophotometer. 1 μg of RNA was used in 20 μl of RT reaction by using SupercriptII (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) or gene-specific primers. For synthesizing dsRNA Bmglv1 and Bmglv2, PCR products were cloned between BamHI and KpnI sites of pB-SK+ vector, and in vitro transcription was done with linearized template using T3 and T7 RNA polymerase, separately. Single strand RNA was purified after DNase treatment to remove template plasmid and quantified in a spectrophotometer. An equal amount of sense and antisense RNA was used for annealing in annealing buffer by heating at 95 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Respective dsRNA was injected on the 1st day of 5th instar larvae. Male and female moths eclosed from dsRNA injected larvae were allowed to mate (15 experiments each for Bmglv1-dsRNA and Bmglv2-dsRNA), and egg hatching was calculated. An equivalent volume of nontarget baculoviral ie1-dsRNA was injected in control larvae. Different concentrations of dsRNA were used for standardization of RNAi, and the data presented here are from larvae injected with 10 μg of dsRNA. A list of primers used for cloning of dsRNA target site has been provided in the supplemental material. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The protocol followed for ChIP was essentially as mentioned on line with the following modifications. Instead of Staphylococcus aureus cells, protein A beads and silkworm embryo were used. Fluorescence real time PCR was done with double-stranded DNA dye SYBR green (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on an ABI PRISM 7700 system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to quantify the enrichment of the cf2-binding element upon ChIP. PCR specificity was confirmed by the molecular size of the PCR product and ΔCt analysis. Reactions were done in triplicate and compared with input DNA also (in triplicate) and nontemplate control (in duplicate). Plasmid Constructions—Full-length Bmglv1 cDNA was cloned between BamHI and KpnI sites in pFB-His-GST expression vector to generate expression plasmid pFB-His-GST-Glv1. This plasmid was later used for transforming DH10Bac bacterial cells to obtain recombinant pFB-His-GST-Glv1 bacmid that was subsequently transfected into Sf9 cells to get the recombinant virus expressing His-GST-Glv1 fusion protein. Maximum expression of the protein was observed between 70 and 96 h postinfection. His-GST-Gloverin1 fusion protein was purified using a glutathione column. To generate expression vectors with different promoters to be used in the in vitro translation reaction, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) polyhedrin promoter of pFB-His-GST basic vector was replaced with B. mori cytoplasmic actin (BmA3-Actin) promoter (for control plasmid) or Bmglv1 or Bmglv2 promoters. For cloning the intronV of Bmglv1, genomic PCR with exon5- and exon6-specific primers (see supplemental material for primer sequences), which amplified exon5-intronV-exon6, was done, and subsequently this PCR product was cloned downstream to gst only or gst + glv1 fusion ORF (Bmglv1::GST-glv1-intronV plasmid). Control plasmid lacking intronV was also generated by RT-PCR using same set of primers and cloned downstream to gst or other ORFs (Bmglv1::GST-glv1-ΔintronV plasmid). To study the role of CF2-binding motif of intronV, a deletion construct lacking cf2 motif was generated by MseI digestion that deleted 53 nucleotides just before intronV-exon6 junction. MseI-digested product was blunt-ended, ligated, and then cloned downstream to gst to generate Bmglv1::GST-glv1-IntronVΔcf2 plasmid. For immunodepletion, a plasmid expressing GST-BmGlv1 fusion protein (Bmglv1::Gst-Bmglv1(ORF)-InVcf2) was generated by cloning Bmglv1 ORF between gst and the Ex5-InV-Ex6 cassette in the plasmid Bmglv1::gstEx5-InV-Ex6. RNase Protection Assay—Exon5-intronV-Exon6 and Exon5-intronVΔcf2-Exon6 fragments were PCR-amplified from the respective plasmid (described in preceding paragraph) constructs using 3′-UTR forward and reverse primers (see supplemental Methods) and cloned in pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The radiolabeled antisense strand was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) in an in vitro transcription reaction. 5 μg of RNA sample was hybridized with in vitro transcribed antisense RNA probe (3 × 105 cpm) at 45 °C overnight. RNA samples were dissolved in 25 μl of 75% form-amide, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. RNase A (100 μg/ml) was added to the reaction mix along with 200 μl of 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA and incubation was done for 1 h at 37 °C. After the RNase incubation, proteinase K (250 μg/ml) digestion was done followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and finally subjected to denaturing (8 m urea) PAGE. Antibacterial and Prepro-processing Assay—Antibacterial activity of BmGlv1 and BmGlv2 was determined by incubating ∼105-106 cells/ml of E. coli with 5 mm of either BmGlv1 or BmGlv2 in 1× PBS, pH 7.1; and 1, 2, 4, and 6 h postincubation, the optical density of the respective cultures was taken, and a graph was plotted. Each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. Antibacterial activity of BmGlv1 and BmGlv2 was also quantified by counting the number of surviving bacteria after 6 h of incubation in the presence of BmGlv1 or BmGlv2 (colony-forming units/ml) on antibiotic-free LB agar plates. In a control experiment, bacteria were incubated with an equivalent amount of PBS. Bacterial challenge activates different proteases that in turn cleave the N-terminal prepro part and release mature AMPs. Hence, fat body extracts from E. coli-challenged 5th instar larvae were prepared 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours post infection and pooled. Later, purified GST-Glv1 and GST-Glv2 proteins were incubated with the pooled fat body extract for 2 h, and then the complete reaction mixture was separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blotting with anti-GST antibody. Release of GST-specific band was an indication of processing of the AMP. Phylogenetic Analysis of Bombyx Gloverins—Best fit model was tested using Model Test as implemented in HyPhy. GTR+G model was selected by both Hierarchical Model Testing and Akilike Information Criteria (AKI score = 13034.9) and α = 2.00475. Using these parameters, a neighbor joining tree was constructed. Identification of Gloverin Family of AMP Genes in B. mori—We have identified four gloverin genes (named as Bmglv1, Bmglv2, Bmglv3, and Bmglv4) in the silkworm B. mori. The gene structures of silkworm gloverins revealed Bmglv1 (3.99 kb) as the largest gloverin (Fig. 1A). Gene structure of Bmglv4 could not be predicted reliably because of the presence of repetitive elements in the scaffold corresponding to exon1. Exons 2-4, which constitute ORFs, are highly conserved in all four gloverins. Phylogenetic analysis based on ORFs of the four gloverins suggested Bmglv1 as the ancestral gene (Fig. 1B, supplemental Fig. 1, and supplemental Table 1). Clearly, Bmglv1 is orthologous to other gloverins as it shares a common ancestor with Manduca sexta and Trichopusia ni gloverins (Fig. 1B). The presence of intronV is the one major difference between Bmglv1 and the other three silkworm gloverins (Fig. 1B). However, intronV of Bmglv1 was lost during first duplication leading to fusion of exon5 and exon6 as a result of which the derived gene Bmglv2 has only five exons. In subsequent duplication events, lengths of different exons largely remained conserved but not of introns (Fig. 1A). Although no clear pattern is seen in intron length dynamics, overall the gene size has become smaller with each round of duplication, precisely because of erosion in intronic regions of the genes (Bmglv1(3.9 kb) → Bmglv3 (2.9 kb)). Among the conserved introns (introns I-IV), a significant deletion in intron length is seen for intronII, during Bmglv2 to Bmglv3 duplication; however, significance of this deletion remains to be elucidated (Fig. 1B). Sizes of different gloverins may also differ because of size variations in their UTRs. Fifth exon contributed to 3′-UTR in all the gloverins except Bmglv1, which has an additional 6th exon as well as part of 3′-UTR. Bmglv3 has the longest 3′-UTR (318 bp) and shows five unique insertions not shared by other gloverins (supplemental Fig. 1 and supplemental Table 1). Apart from this, 3′-UTRs of four gloverins also share low homology at the sequence level. Lack of conservation in A/T-rich 3′-UTRs of gloverins possibly indicates lack of conserved regulatory function. We also confirmed the physical location of the four gloverins. Although Bmglv1, Bmglv3, and Bmglv4 were physically mapped to chromosome 28, Bmglv2 was mapped to chromosome 17 (Fig. 1C). 4K. Mita, personal communication. Bmglv1 and Bmglv4 are present as tandemly duplicated genes on positive strand at 38.6 → 45.0 centimorgans, and Bmglv2 and Bmglv3 are present on the complementary strand at 0 centimorgans ←16.4 centimorgans on chromosome 17 and at 22.8 → 37.3 centimorgans on chromosome 28, respectively (Fig. 1C). Bmglv1 Is Not Expressed in Embryo Unlike Other AMP Genes—Induction of expression of AMP genes in larval and adult tissues, mainly fat body and mid-gut, upon immune challenge is an established fact (1Hoffmann J.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). However, we observed basal expression of Bmglv2-4 in embryonic stages (Fig. 2A). Other than Bmglv2-4, attacin and hemolin genes are also expressed in all embryonic stages. Significantly Bmglv1 does not express in embryos (Fig. 2A). A more interesting developmental regulation of AMP expression was observed in gonads as we found that Bmglv1 is expressed in larval but not in adult gonads, whereas hemolin and other gloverins expre"
https://openalex.org/W2067903551,"Background The study of adult stem cells relies on the ability to isolate them using complex combinations of markers for flow cytometry. A recent study has used a tetracycline-regulatable H2B-GFP transgenic mouse model analogous to BrdU pulse-chase methods to fluorescently label quiescent skin stem cells in vivo. In this study, we sought to use these mice to fluorescently label hematopoietic stem cells to study niche interactions. Methods and Findings We crossed the H2B-GFP mice to mice carrying a tetracycline-regulated transactivator protein. When these mice were administered doxycycline, we observed a gradual decrease in total bone marrow GFP+ cells over 12 weeks but the hematopoietic stem cell population remained largely GFP+ (>85%). In histological bone sections, the long-term GFP label-retaining cells tended to concentrate at the endosteal surface and competitive transplantation assays showed that the majority of hematopoietic stem cell activity was contained in the GFP+ cell fraction. However, in response to stimulation with 5-fluorouracil, the hematopoietic stem cells of the crossed mice still retained a high level of GFP expression when it was anticipated the label should be lost when the cells divide. Upon further review, it was determined that the founder H2B-GFP mice showed spurious expression of the transgene at high levels in the hematopoietic stem cell population, thus the observed response of hematopoietic stem cells in the double transgenic mice to doxycycline was due to aberrant expression of the transgene and not the correct tetracycline-regulatable system. Conclusions We observed promiscuous expression of the H2B-GFP transgene in the hematopoietic stem cell compartment of the bone marrow. This leaky expression prohibits the use of this model to study hematopoietic stem cells in vivo and careful characterization for each organ must be done if this transgenic system is to be used to isolate other prospective tissue stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2163803815,"Although the expression of PECAM-1 (CD31) on vascular and haematopoietic cells within the bone marrow microenvironment has been recognized for some time, its physiological role within this niche remains unexplored. In this study we show that PECAM-1 influences steady state hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) progenitor numbers in the peripheral blood but not the bone marrow compartment. PECAM-1−/− mice have higher levels of HSC progenitors in the blood compared to their littermate controls. We show that PECAM-1 is required on both progenitors and bone marrow vascular cells in order for efficient transition between the blood and bone marrow to occur. We have identified key roles for PECAM-1 in both the regulation of HSC migration to the chemokine CXCL12, as well as maintaining levels of the matrix degrading enzyme MMP-9 in the bone marrow vascular niche. Using intravital microscopy and adoptive transfer of either wild type (WT) or PECAM-1−/− bone marrow precursors, we demonstrate that the increase in HSC progenitors in the blood is due in part to a reduced ability to migrate from blood to the bone marrow vascular niche. These findings suggest a novel role for PECAM-1 as a regulator of resting homeostatic progenitor cell numbers in the blood"

Here we demonstrate that it is possible to determine a protein structure by solid-state NMR to a resolution comparable to that by solution NMR. Using an iterative assignment and structure calculation protocol, a large number of distance restraints was extracted from (1)H/(1)H mixing experiments recorded on a single uniformly labeled sample under magic angle spinning conditions. The calculated structure has a coordinate precision of 0.6 A and 1.3 A for the backbone and side chain heavy atoms, respectively, and deviates from the structure observed in solution. The approach is expected to be applicable to larger systems enabling the determination of high-resolution structures of amyloid or membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1984250787,"Although ascidians are hermaphroditic, many species including Halocynthia roretzi are self-sterile. We previously reported that a vitelline coat polymorphic protein HrVC70, consisting of 12 EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like repeats, is a candidate allorecognition protein in H. roretzi, because the isolated HrVC70 shows higher affinity to nonself-sperm than to self-sperm. Here, we show that a sperm 35-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored CRISP (cysteine-rich secretory protein)-like protein HrUrabin in a low density detergent-insoluble membrane fraction is a physiological binding partner for HrVC70. We found that HrVC70 specifically interacts with HrUrabin, which had been separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. HrUrabin has an N-linked sugar chain, essential for binding to HrVC70. HrUrabin mRNA is expressed in the testis but not in the ovary, and the protein appears to be localized on the surface of sperm head and tail. Anti-HrUrabin antibody, which neutralizes the interaction between HrUrabin and HrVC70, potently inhibited fertilization and allorecognizable sperm-binding to HrVC70-agarose. However, no significant difference in the binding ability of HrUrabin to HrVC70 was observed in autologous and allogeneic combinations by Far Western analyses. These results indicate that sperm-egg binding in H. roretzi is mediated by the molecular interaction between HrUrabin on the sperm surface and HrVC70 on the vitelline coat, but that HrUrabin per se is unlikely to be a direct allorecognition protein.

Ascidians, the invertebrate chordates, are hermaphroditic animals releasing gametes nearly simultaneously during the spawning season. Most ascidians show self-sterility or preference for “non-autologous” (allogeneic) fertilization (1Harada H. Sawada H. Int. J. Dev.

Later, it was found that only nonself-sperm tightly and specifically bound to the VC of glycerinated eggs in C. intestinalis (7Rosati F. De Santis R. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 112: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). From these results, it is currently believed that a certain allorecognition molecule responsible for self-sterility must reside on the VC. We have been studying the mechanism of self-sterility using another solitary ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi, because a large quantity of readily fertilizable gametes can be easily obtained from this species, which is aqua-cultured in Japan for human consumption (8Sawada H. Zool. Sci. 2002; 19: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although H. roretzi exhibits much more strict self-sterility than C. intestinalis, the mode of self-sterility in both species seems to be similar. In H. roretzi, the occurrence of a self-fertilization barrier on the VC, but not on the follicle cells, was clearly demonstrated by experiments using “mosaic eggs,” whose follicle cells were replaced by those of different individuals (9Fuke T.M. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1983; 192: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As in C. intestinalis, mature oocytes but not immature oocytes are self-sterile in H. roretzi, and the self-sterility is lost by treatment with acidic seawater (9Fuke T.M. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1983; 192: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the acquisition of self-sterility during oocyte maturation was blocked by trypsin inhibitors, whereas exogenously added trypsin stimulates the acquisition of self-sterility (10Fuke M. Numakunai T. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1996; 205: 391-400Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Fuke M. Numakunai T. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 52: 99-106Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These results led us to propose that a putative allorecognition protein might be expressed in immature oocytes as a precursor and that the active form might be generated by a trypsin-like protease, resulting in its attachment to the VC during oocyte maturation. It is also inferred that this putative molecule might be easily extracted from the VC by mildly acidic conditions. To test this possibility, we compared the components of the VCs from immature oocytes with those from mature oocytes of H. roretzi by SDS-PAGE. We found that a 70-kDa VC protein HrVC70, which had been identified as a sperm receptor consisting of 12 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats (12Sawada H. Sakai N. Abe Y. Tanaka E. Takahashi Y. Fujino J Kodama E Takizawa S. Yokosawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), appears to be attached to the VC during oocyte maturation and that this protein is easily and almost specifically extracted from the insoluble VC by 1-10 mm HCl (pH 2-3) (13Sawada H. Tanaka E. Ban S. Yamasaki C. Fujino J. Ooura K. Abe Y. Matsumoto K. Yokosawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15615-15620Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HrVC70 is converted by a trypsin-like protease from its precursor HrVC120, which contains 13 EGF repeats, a zona pellucida domain, and a transmembrane helix (13Sawada H. Tanaka E. Ban S. Yamasaki C. Fujino J. Ooura K. Abe Y. Matsumoto K. Yokosawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15615-15620Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Difference in the binding ability of sperm to the VC between autologous and allogeneic gamete combinations is not obvious in H. roretzi (10Fuke M. Numakunai T. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1996; 205: 391-400Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, we found that nonself-sperm shows a significantly higher affinity to HrVC70-immobilized agarose beads than self-sperm (13Sawada H. Tanaka E. Ban S. Yamasaki C. Fujino J. Ooura K. Abe Y. Matsumoto K. Yokosawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15615-15620Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, fertilization was more strongly inhibited by the pretreatment of sperm with nonself-HrVC70 than self-HrVC70 (13Sawada H. Tanaka E. Ban S. Yamasaki C. Fujino J. Ooura K. Abe Y. Matsumoto K. Yokosawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15615-15620Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Finally, HrVC70 appeared to be a highly polymorphic protein, showing no identical sequence among 10 individuals tested (13Sawada H. Tanaka E. Ban S. Yamasaki C. Fujino J. Ooura K. Abe Y. Matsumoto K. Yokosawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15615-15620Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). From these results, together with the fact that even a single amino acid substitution is sufficient to affect the molecular recognition between EGF-like repeat-containing molecules such as Notch, Delta, and Serrate (14Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 15Joutel A. Corpechot C. Ducros A. Vahedi K. Chabriat H. Mouton P. Domenga V. Cécillion M. Marechal E. Maciazek J. Vayssiere C. Cruaud C. Cabanis E.A. Ruchoux M.M. Weissenbach J. Bach J.F. Bousser M.G. Tournier-Lasserve E. Nature. 1996; 383: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar), we proposed that HrVC70 is a promising candidate for the allorecognition protein, which is responsible for self-sterility. To gain insights on the molecular mechanism of allorecognition, we have explored a sperm-borne binding partner for HrVC70 by several approaches. We previously reported that a type II transmembrane protease, HrTTSP-1, is a candidate sperm-derived HrVC70-interacting protein as revealed by yeast two-hybrid screening baited with HrVC70 (16Harada Y. Sawada H. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2007; 74: 1178-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the present report, we carried out Far Western blot analysis using HrVC70 as a probe, and identified a 35-kDa sperm membrane-associated glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein as a physiological binding partner for HrVC70. Biological Materials and Preparations of the VC and Low-density Detergent-insoluble Membrane (LD-DIM) Fraction—Spawning of H. roretzi, collected near Mutsu Bay in northern Japan, was induced by controlling the seawater temperature and light conditions as described previously (17Sawada H. Yokosawa H. Hoshi M. Ishii S. Gamete Res. 1982; 5: 291-301Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Sperm and eggs were collected individually and used for fertilization experiments or stored at -20 °C until use. The VC of H. roretzi eggs was prepared as described previously (12Sawada H. Sakai N. Abe Y. Tanaka E. Takahashi Y. Fujino J Kodama E Takizawa S. Yokosawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen-thawed eggs were mixed with an equal volume of homogenizing buffer (20 mm EPPS (pH 8.0), 460 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer at 2,000 rpm, 10 times. The homogenate was filtered through a nylon mesh (50 μm), and the VC on the mesh was washed with 0.2× artificial seawater 5-10 times, followed by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 5 min. The VC (precipitate) was further washed twice with MilliQ water. HrVC70 was isolated from the VC as follows (12Sawada H. Sakai N. Abe Y. Tanaka E. Takahashi Y. Fujino J Kodama E Takizawa S. Yokosawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The VC was mixed with 2-3 volumes of 10 mm HCl and incubated at 13 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min), the supernatant fraction, which contains almost exclusively HrVC70, was neutralized with 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) and stored frozen until use. The LD-DIM fraction from H. roretzi sperm was prepared as described previously for sea urchin sperm (18Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Toriyama M. Vacquier V.D. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Toriyama M. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, intact sperm suspensions were mixed with an equal volume of homogenizing buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After standing for 20 min on ice, the sperm suspension was disrupted with a Teflon homogenizer at 2,000 rpm, 10 times, and subjected to low-speed centrifugation (7,000 ×g for 5 min). One ml of the resulting supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 85% (w/v) sucrose and transferred into an ultracentrifuge tube, which was gently overlaid by 2 ml of 30% sucrose, and 1 ml of 5% sucrose in this order. After centrifugation (200,000 × g, 18 h, 4 °C), the LD-DIM fraction was obtained in a boundary between the 5 and 30% sucrose layers. Protein concentration in each fraction separated by ultracentifugation was determined using the ABC kit (Bio-Rad). Molecular Biological Techniques—Degenerate primers were designed based on the determined N-terminal 30 amino acid residues (forward-1 primer, 5′-GA(A/G)GTN(A/C)GIAT(A/C/T)(C/T)TIACIAC-3′, forward-nested primer, 5′-GA(A/G)GTN-(A/C)GIAT(A/C/T)(C/T)TIACIACIGA(A/G)GA(A/G)AA(A/G)CA-3′; I, inosine), and 3′-RACE PCR was performed on gonad cDNA from a reproductively mature animal prepared with the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). Nearly entire cDNA fragments were obtained by screening a H. roretzi gonad λ-ZAP cDNA library (Stratagene) probed with the 3′-RACE product. The 5′ terminus of the mRNA was determined by 5′-RACE. Northern blotting and genomic Southern blotting of HrUrabins were carried out as described previously (14Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), using a digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe corresponding from Pro49 to Leu287 in HrUrabin-L. Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (16Harada Y. Sawada H. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2007; 74: 1178-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), using a digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe including the entire cDNA sequence of HrUrabin-L. Immunological Procedures and Far Western Analysis—To develop an anti-HrVC70 polyclonal antibody, the HrVC70 band purified from the VC by SDS-PAGE, was used as an antigen. As to HrUrabin, thioredoxin-tagged fusion protein, including the entire sequence of the processed form of HrUrabin-L, was bacterially expressed using the PET Trx Fusion System 32 (Novagen). The rabbit antisera raised against HrVC70 and HrUrabin were prepared by Hokudo Ltd. Anti-HrVC70 antibody specifically reacted to HrVC70 among the VC components, and showed no cross-reactivity to any sperm membrane proteins on the basis of Western blotting under the conditions tested. Far Western analysis was carried out as described below. Each fraction separated by discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation was subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 3× PBS containing 1% blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science). The membrane was further incubated overnight at room temperature with 0.02% (v/v) of HrVC70 in 3× PBS containing 0.1% SDS and 3% blocking reagent. HrVC70-interacting protein band(s) were detected by anti-HrVC70 rabbit antibody using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Inhibitory ability of anti-HrUrabin antibody on this interaction was examined by adding anti-HrUrabin antibody during incubation with HrVC70. To distinguish two rabbit antibodies (anti-HrVC70 and anti-HrUrabin), biotin-labeled anti-HrVC70 antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Calbiochem) were used to detect the HrVC70-interacting protein(s) on a membrane. For immunocytochemistry, spermatozoa supported on the aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated slide glass (Matsunami Glass) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After several washes with 1× PBS, the specimen was reacted with 1/1000 diluted anti-HrUrabin anti-serum in 1× PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, then washed several times, followed by incubation with 2 μg/ml of Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Invitrogen) and 5 μg/ml of 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) in 1× PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with 1× PBS, the specimen was observed under an inverted fluorescent microscope (Nikon). Enzymatic Elimination Procedures of GPI Anchor and Sugar Chains—To examine whether HrUrabins are sperm-surface GPI-anchored proteins, intact sperm was incubated with 1 unit of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC, Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The obtained supernatant was subjected to Western analysis using the anti-HrUrabin antibody. An N-linked glycosylation site on each HrUrabin species was predicted from their amino acid sequences. To examine whether a carbohydrate chain is linked to the consensus Asn residue of HrUrabins, the LD-DIM fraction was incubated with 5 units of PNGase F (Sigma) in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) for 2 h at 37 °C. The reacted sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western and Far Western analyses. Amino Acid Sequences and Compositions, and LC/MS/MS Analyses—For determination of amino acid sequences of HrUrabins, the LD-DIM fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE in the presence of thioglycolate, followed by electrophoretic transfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was cut off and subjected to protein sequence analysis. For analyses of amino acid compositions, the 35- and 50-kDa HrUrabin bands in LD-DIM fraction, which were separated by SDS-PAGE, were excised, extracted, and subjected to acid hydrolysis (6 n HCl in in vacuo, 24 h). The hydrolysate, thus prepared, was subjected to amino acid analysis using a JEOL JLC/500V amino acid analyzer. The 35- and 50-kDa protein bands were subjected to reduced carboxymethylation with monoiodoacetic acid, and then digested with trypsin (Trypsin Gold, Mass Spectrometry Grade, Promega) according to a procedure described previously (20Harazono A. Kawasaki N. Kawanishi T. Hayakawa T. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 447-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Trypsin-digested fragments were subjected to high performance liquid chromatography with a C18 reverse phase column at a constant flow rate of 200 nl/min. After applying the sample to the column (0.05 × 150 mm), which had been equilibrated with 0.1% formic acid containing 2% acetonitrile, the column was washed with equilibration buffer and eluted by a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 2 to 50% in 60 min. The eluate was automatically subjected to an ESI-MS/MS with an LTQ (Thermo, Fisher Scientific). Fertilization and Beads Binding Experiments—To avoid any nonspecific inhibitory effect on fertilization caused by serum ingredients, purified anti-HrUrabin polyclonal antibody was used for the following experiments. Antibody purification was carried out using Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). For the fertilization experiments, sperm were preincubated with anti-HrUrabin antibody or non-immune control antibody for 30 min at 13 °C. Into the sperm suspension (100 μl), a small volume of egg suspension was added and incubated at 13 °C. Fertilization ratio was determined by examining the expansion of perivitelline space, 30-60 min after insemination. For bead-binding experiments, isolated HrVC70 from the VC was conjugated to the Protein A-Sepharose beads via the anti-HrVC70 antibody as described previously (13Sawada H. Tanaka E. Ban S. Yamasaki C. Fujino J. Ooura K. Abe Y. Matsumoto K. Yokosawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15615-15620Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Self- or nonself-sperm suspensions in artificial seawater, which had been incubated for 30 min at 13 °C with control or anti-HrUrabin antibodies at a concentration of 2 mg/ml, was added into a small volume of HrVC70 beads. After the incubation and gentle washes with seawater, sperm were cross-linked onto the beads with 2% paraformaldehyde, and stained with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole. The number of sperm bound to a single agarose bead (50-100 beads were examined for each batch) was counted under a light or fluorescent microscope. Identification of a Binding Partner (HrUrabin) for HrVC70—In sea urchin sperm, most surface proteins that are involved in gamete interaction are known to reside on a LD-DIM fraction or lipid raft fraction (18Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Toriyama M. Vacquier V.D. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Toriyama M. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). According to the protocol for sea urchin sperm (18Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Toriyama M. Vacquier V.D. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Toriyama M. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we prepared the LD-DIM fraction from H. roretzi sperm (Fig. 1A). These fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, followed by incubation with HrVC70. HrVC70-interacting proteins on the membrane were detected by an anti-HrVC70 antibody. This Far Western analysis revealed that HrVC70 specifically recognizes a 35-kDa protein from the LD-DIM fraction (Fig. 1, B and C, fraction 2) but not other membrane proteins mainly fractionated in fraction 7. The interaction between these proteins appeared to be enhanced in artificial seawater or high-ionic strength buffer (3× PBS) rather than in 1× PBS (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction is achieved under physiological seawater conditions. To identify this protein, the 35-kDa protein on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was cut out and subjected to protein sequence analysis. On the basis of the determined N-terminal 30 residues (EVRILTTEEKQLLLDEHNKARSEVVPKAXN), two degenerate primers were synthesized, and 3′-RACE and 5′-RACE were carried out. A cDNA library was screened with the obtained RACE clone, yielding two similar but not identical cDNA clones, which encoded the same sequence to the N-terminal sequence of the 35-kDa protein. We designated these genes HrUrabin (Halocynthia roretzi unique raft-derived binding protein for HrVC70) and HrUrabin-L (a long isoform). Schematic representations (A) and deduced amino acid sequences (B) of HrUrabin and HrUrabin-L are depicted in Fig. 2. These HrUrabin and HrUrabin-L are novel genes, showing a similarity to HrTT-1 (21Hotta K. Takahashi H. Satoh N. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 208: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which was characterized as a gene exclusively expressed in the tail tip of tailbud embryos of H. roretzi. Both HrUrabin and HrUrabin-L contain a signal peptide, a PR (plant pathogenesis-related 1) domain, which is well conserved in the CRISP (Cys-rich secretory protein) family with two sperm-coating glycoprotein (SCP) motifs, and a single N-glycosylation site, (and six acidic-rich repeats at the C-terminal side only in HrUrabin-L), which is followed by a GPI-anchor attachment site and a cleavable transmembrane domain (Fig. 2). Unlike HrVC70, both HrUrabin and HrUrabin-L were not so polymorphic among different individuals (data not shown). The molecular masses of unmodified HrUrabin and HrUrabin-L were estimated to be 30,008 and 33,362 Da, respectively. On the other hand, the molecular masses of the mature forms, lacking a signal peptide and a C-terminal portion of GPI-anchor attachment site, and containing a GPI-anchor (∼2 kDa), were estimated to be 27 and 30 kDa, respectively. Expression and Localization of HrUrabins—Southern blotting probed with an HrUrabin cDNA, which reacts with both isoforms, using the genomic DNAs digested with several restriction enzymes gave a single band in each lane (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the copy number of these genes seems to be single or very low. To determine whether these genes are independent, we isolated several genomic clones containing the HrUrabin-derived sequence by screening a λ phage genomic library. We found that several clones contained both genes (data not shown). This indicates that HrUrabin and HrUrabin-L are two distinct gene copies rather than splice variants of a single gene, being located adjacently within ∼20-kbp in the genome of H. roretzi. Northern blotting showed that about 0.9-kb HrUrabin mRNAs are expressed in gonad, although two mRNA species were scarcely separated under these conditions (Fig. 3B). The results of whole mount in situ hybridization also revealed that HrUrabin mRNAs are specifically expressed in the testis but not in the ovary (compare Fig. 4, A and B). Immunocytochemistry using a specific antibody, raised in a rabbit against glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, revealed the patch-like localization of HrUrabin on the surface of the sperm head and tail (Fig. 4, C and D). HrUrabin and HrUrabin-L Genes Encode the 35- and 50-kDa Proteins, Respectively—Anti-HrUrabin antibody reacted not only to the original 35-kDa protein but also to a novel 50-kDa protein by Western blotting (Fig. 3C, upper panel, left lane). To identify this novel protein, we first determined the N-terminal sequence. The main sequence of its N-terminal five residues was identical to that of 35-kDa HrUrabin, suggesting that the 50-kDa protein is not a cross-reacted unrelated protein but an isoform of HrUrabin. We next analyzed the amino acid compositions of both isoforms. The amino acid composition of the 50-kDa protein did not coincide with the number of amino acids deduced from a cDNA of HrUrabin-L or HrUrabin, although the amino acid composition of the 35-kDa protein coincided well with the number of amino acids deduced from a cDNA of HrUrabin sequence (data not shown). To examine whether or not the 50-kDa protein is encoded by HrUrabin-L, trypsin-digested fragments of the reduced and carboxymethylated 50- and also 35-kDa proteins were separated by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Each peptide was identified by subsequent tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The results clearly showed that the 50-kDa protein is a gene product of HrUrabin-L (Fig. S1) and also confirmed that the 35-kDa protein is a gene product of HrUrabin. HrUrabin and HrUrabin-L showed amino acid substitutions at 6 positions (blue letters shown in Fig. 2B), among which only Val237 and Lys237 were found to be characteristic to HrUrabin and HrUrabin-L, respectively, because a Val237-containing peptide (number 24′) and a Lys237-containing peptide (numbers L23′) occur only in the 35- and 50-kDa proteins, respectively (see Fig. S1). Another 5 substitutions were polymorphisms commonly observed in HrUrabin and HrUrabin-L, which was revealed by LC/MS/MS analysis. During the course of this study, we noticed that a few individuals (at a ratio of ∼5-10%) expressed neither the 50-kDa protein detected by Western blotting nor the HrUrabin-L gene copy detected by genomic PCR analysis (see Fig. 3C, right lanes). These results agreed with our previous conclusion that the 50-kDa protein is encoded by HrUrabin-L. In addition, this also indicates that HrUrabin-L is not essential for fertilization in H. roretzi. Posttranslational Modifications of HrUrabin and HrUrabin-L—Because the molecular sizes of HrUrabin and HrUrabin-L, which were estimated by SDS-PAGE, were higher than those deduced from their cDNA sequences, it is likely that these proteins are posttranslationally modified. This is partly due to the existence of an N-linked carbohydrate moiety occurring in both HrUrabin and HrUrabin-L (Fig. 2), because ∼3-5-kDa lower molecular mass bands were observed in both proteins under SDS-PAGE after"
https://openalex.org/W2078798531,"Gene duplication is a major driver of evolutionary innovation as it allows for an organism to elaborate its existing biological functions via specialization or diversification of initially redundant gene paralogs. Gene function can diversify in several ways. Transcription factor gene paralogs in particular, can diversify either by changes in their tissue-specific expression pattern or by changes in the DNA binding site motif recognized by their protein product, which in turn alters their gene targets. The relationship between these two modes of functional diversification of transcription factor paralogs has not been previously investigated, and is essential for understanding adaptive evolution of transcription factor gene families.Based on a large set of human paralogous transcription factor pairs, we show that when the DNA binding site motifs of transcription factor paralogs are similar, the expressions of the genes that encode the paralogs have diverged, so in general, at most one of the paralogs is highly expressed in a tissue. Moreover, paralogs with diverged DNA binding site motifs tend to be diverged in their function. Conversely, two paralogs that are highly expressed in a tissue tend to have dissimilar DNA binding site motifs. We have also found that in general, within a paralogous family, tissue-specific decrease in gene expression is more frequent than what is expected by chance.While previous investigations of paralogous gene diversification have only considered coding sequence divergence, by explicitly quantifying divergence in DNA binding site motif, our work presents a new paradigm for investigating functional diversification. Consistent with evolutionary expectation, our quantitative analysis suggests that paralogous transcription factors have survived extinction in part, either through diversification of their DNA binding site motifs or through alterations in their tissue-specific expression levels."
https://openalex.org/W2018223052,"Background Understanding how mammalian cells are regulated epigenetically to express phenotype is a priority. The cellular phenotypic transition, induced by ionising radiation, from a normal cell to the genomic instability phenotype, where the ability to replicate the genotype accurately is compromised, illustrates important features of epigenetic regulation. Based on this phenomenon and earlier work we propose a model to describe the mammalian cell as a self assembled open system operating in an environment that includes its genotype, neighbouring cells and beyond. Phenotype is represented by high dimensional attractors, evolutionarily conditioned for stability and robustness and contingent on rules of engagement between gene products encoded in the genetic network. Methodology/Findings We describe how this system functions and note the indeterminacy and fluidity of its internal workings which place it in the logical reasoning framework of predicative logic. We find that the hypothesis is supported by evidence from cell and molecular biology. Conclusions Epigenetic regulation and memory are fundamentally physical, as opposed to chemical, processes and the transition to genomic instability is an important feature of mammalian cells with probable fundamental relevance to speciation and carcinogenesis. A source of evolutionarily selectable variation, in terms of the rules of engagement between gene products, is seen as more likely to have greater prominence than genetic variation in an evolutionary context. As this epigenetic variation is based on attractor states phenotypic changes are not gradual; a phenotypic transition can involve the changed contribution of several gene products in a single step."
https://openalex.org/W2007500310,"Background Moderate alcohol use is generally associated with lower ischaemic heart disease (IHD) mortality but it is difficult to ascertain whether this is due to attributes of moderate alcohol users or the properties of alcohol itself. Evidence from populations with different patterns of alcohol use and IHD can provide crucial evidence. We assessed the association of moderate alcohol use with IHD mortality in older Chinese people from Hong Kong. Methodology We used Cox regression to determine whether moderate alcohol use was associated with IHD mortality in a prospective, population-based cohort study of all 56167 attendees, aged 65 years or over, from July 1998 to December 2000 at all 18 Elderly Health Centers operated by the Department of Health in Hong Kong. Principal Findings After a median follow-up of 4.2 years, there were 406 (188 in men, 218 in women) deaths from IHD in 54,090 subjects (96.3% successful follow-up). Moderate alcohol use in men was not associated with IHD mortality adjusted only for age [Hazard Ratio, HR 1.01 (95% CI 0.55 to 1.84) compared with never drinkers] or additionally adjusted for socio-economic status and lifestyle. Almost all women were occasional drinkers and their current alcohol use was not significantly associated with IHD mortality [HR 0.88, (95% CI 0.51 to 1.53)]. Conclusions Moderate alcohol use had no effect on IHD mortality in older Chinese men. Lack of replication of the usual protective effect of moderate alcohol use in a setting with a different pattern of alcohol use and IHD could be due to chance or could suggest that the protective effect of alcohol on IHD does not extend to all populations."
https://openalex.org/W2101087371,"Background The emergence of tuberculosis resistant to multiple first- and second-line antibiotics poses challenges to a global control strategy that relies on standard drug treatment regimens. Highly drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been implicated in outbreaks and have been found throughout the world; a comprehensive understanding the magnitude of this threat requires an accurate assessment of the worldwide burden of resistance. Unfortunately, in many settings where resistance is emerging, laboratory capacity is limited and estimates of the burden of resistance are obtained by performing drug sensitivity testing on a sample of incident cases rather than through the use of routine surveillance. Methodology/Principal Findings Using an individual-based dynamic tuberculosis model to simulate surveillance strategies for drug resistance, we found that current surveys may underestimate the total burden of resistant tuberculosis because cases of acquired resistance are undercounted and resistance among prevalent cases is not assessed. We explored how this bias is affected by the maturity of the epidemic and by the introduction of interventions that target the emergence and spread of resistant tuberculosis. Conclusions Estimates of drug resistant tuberculosis based on samples of incident cases should be viewed as a lower bound of the total burden of resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2054213399,"In early pregnancy, the O(2) gradient between the maternal circulation and the gestational sac tissues modulates trophoblast biological functions. The aim was to evaluate if placental partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)) modulates in vivo synthesis of specific placental proteins inside the first trimester gestational sac. Matched samples of peripheral venous blood, blood from the placental bed (PB), coelomic fluid (CF) and placental tissue were obtained in 37 normal pregnancies at 6-12 weeks gestation. PaO(2) was measured in PB and CF using an IRMA blood gas monitor. Inhibin A, activin A, sEng, PlGF, sFlt-1 and free VEGF concentrations were measured in all samples. HSP 70 was measured in placental extracts. ANOVA showed approximately 60% increase in PB PaO(2) (P = 0.02) between after 10 weeks gestation. Unpaired Student's T-test between two groups (6-9 weeks vs 9-12 weeks) shows a significant increase in MS Activin A (P = 0.001), CF activin A (P<0.001), MS P1GF (P = 0.001), CF PlGF (P<0.001), MS sFLT-1 (P = 0.03), CF sFLT-1 (P = 0.01), HSP 70 in placental extracts (P = 0.04) and a significant decrease in PB inhibin A levels (P<0.001) and PB sFLT-1 (P = 0.02) . Multiple correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation between PB inhibin A levels and gestation (r = -0.45, P<0.05) and PB PaO(2) (r = -0.5, P = 0.008) and also between sFLT-1 and PB PaO(2) (P = 0.03). There was a positive correlation (P<0.01) between PlGF, sEng and VEGF levels in the placental extracts. Our results indicate a direct relationship in the early intrauterine PaO(2) in vivo and inhibin A and sFLT-1 concentrations confirming our hypothesis that specific placental proteins are regulated by intrauterine O(2) tension."
https://openalex.org/W2085626582,"A cis-acting RNA regulatory element, the Rev-responsive element (RRE), has essential roles in replication of lentiviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and equine infection anemia virus (EIAV). The RRE binds the viral trans-acting regulatory protein, Rev, to mediate nucleocytoplasmic transport of incompletely spliced mRNAs encoding viral structural genes and genomic RNA. Because of its potential as a clinical target, RRE-Rev interactions have been well studied in HIV-1; however, detailed molecular structures of Rev-RRE complexes in other lentiviruses are still lacking. In this study, we investigate the secondary structure of the EIAV RRE and interrogate regulatory protein-RNA interactions in EIAV Rev-RRE complexes. Computational prediction and detailed chemical probing and footprinting experiments were used to determine the RNA secondary structure of EIAV RRE-1, a 555 nt region that provides RRE function in vivo. Chemical probing experiments confirmed the presence of several predicted loop and stem-loop structures, which are conserved among 140 EIAV sequence variants. Footprinting experiments revealed that Rev binding induces significant structural rearrangement in two conserved domains characterized by stable stem-loop structures. Rev binding region-1 (RBR-1) corresponds to a genetically-defined Rev binding region that overlaps exon 1 of the EIAV rev gene and contains an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE). RBR-2, characterized for the first time in this study, is required for high affinity binding of EIAV Rev to the RRE. RBR-2 contains an RNA structural motif that is also found within the high affinity Rev binding site in HIV-1 (stem-loop IIB), and within or near mapped RRE regions of four additional lentiviruses. The powerful integration of computational and experimental approaches in this study has generated a validated RNA secondary structure for the EIAV RRE and provided provocative evidence that high affinity Rev binding sites of HIV-1 and EIAV share a conserved RNA structural motif. The presence of this motif in phylogenetically divergent lentiviruses suggests that it may play a role in highly conserved interactions that could be targeted in novel anti-lentiviral therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2091514999,"With the growing incidence of HIV, there is a desperate need to develop simple, cheap and effective new ways of preventing HIV infection. Male circumcision reduces the risk of infection by about 60%, probably because of the removal of the Langerhans cells which are abundant in the inner foreskin and are the primary route by which HIV enters the penis. Langerhans cells form a vital part of the body's natural defence against HIV and only cause infection when they are exposed to high levels of HIV virions. Rather than removing this natural defence mechanism by circumcision, it may be better to enhance it by thickening the layer of keratin overlying the Langerhans cells, thereby reducing the viral load to which they are exposed. We have investigated the ability of topically administered oestrogen to induce keratinization of the epithelium of the inner foreskin. Histochemically, the whole of the foreskin is richly supplied with oestrogen receptors. The epithelium of the inner foreskin, like the vagina, responds within 24 hours to the topical administration of oestriol by keratinization, and the response persists for at least 5 days after the cessation of the treatment. Oestriol, a cheap, readily available natural oestrogen metabolite, rapidly keratinizes the inner foreskin, the site of HIV entry into the penis. This thickening of the overlying protective layer of keratin should reduce the exposure of the underlying Langerhans cells to HIV virions. This simple treatment could become an adjunct or alternative to surgical circumcision for reducing the incidence of HIV infection in men."
https://openalex.org/W2045154151,"Parallel processing of multiple sensory stimuli is critical for efficient, successful interaction with the environment. An experimental approach to studying parallel processing in sensorimotor integration is to examine reaction times to multiple copies of the same stimulus. Reaction times to bilateral copies of light flashes are faster than to single, unilateral light flashes. These faster responses may be due to ‘statistical facilitation’ between independent processing streams engaged by the two copies of the light flash. On some trials, however, reaction times are faster than predicted by statistical facilitation. This indicates that a neural ‘coactivation’ of the two processing streams must have occurred. Here we use fMRI to investigate the neural locus of this coactivation. Subjects responded manually to the detection of unilateral light flashes presented to the left or right visual hemifield, and to the detection of bilateral light flashes. We compared the bilateral trials where subjects' reaction times exceeded the limit predicted by statistical facilitation to bilateral trials that did not exceed the limit. Activity in the right temporo-parietal junction was higher in those bilateral trials that showed coactivation than in those that did not. These results suggest the neural coactivation observed in visuomotor integration occurs at a cognitive rather than sensory or motor stage of processing."
https://openalex.org/W2057851739,"Background The aim is to investigate the factors that might be associated with the presence of induced abortion (IA) in women prostitutes in Asturias (Spain). Methodology/Principal Findings Cross-sectional descriptive study by self-completion questionnaire of 212 women prostitutes who attended the three Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinics in Asturias, between January–December 2003. The questionnaire was designed to investigate the women's perceived knowledge (what they claimed to know), their real knowledge (what they really knew), the use of contraceptive methods and socio-demographic variables. Multivariate analysis was carried out. 92% of the participants were immigrants. 76% were practising at brothel. 37.6% (95%CI:30.7–44.4%) reported to have undergone at least one IA during their life. According to the logistic regression the “presence of IA” was directly associated with the variables “number of pregnancies”(OR:65.82;95%IC:7.73–560.14) and “years of practising prostitution”(OR:1.13;95%CI:0.99–1.29); and inversely associated with “children”(0 = no children;1 = one or more children; OR:0.005;95%CI:0.000–0.057), “women's age”(OR:0.89;95%CI:0.82–0.97) and “real contraceptive knowledge”(OR:0.50; 95%CI:0.34–0.75). Married women were more likely to have undergone an IA (OR:2.74;95%IC:1.05–7.13). No association with “perceived contraceptive knowledge” was found. Conclusions/Significance The characteristics more closely linked to the reproductive history of the women (such as “pregnancies”, “children”), together with the “real contraceptive knowledge” and the “time practising prostitution” explain the presence of IA better than factors more closely linked to the conditions in which the women practise prostitution (“place of activity”, “other activities compatible with prostitution”, “use of safe method in commercial relation”). It is possible that IA is being used as a birth control method, hypothesis suggested by the inverse association observed between the variable “children” and the “presence of IA”. Therefore, the promotion of the use of safe contraceptive methods should be a high-priority. If the real contraceptive knowledge was measured correctly, all strategies to increase it would be justified because it was inversely associated with the presence of IA."
https://openalex.org/W2053261010,"Antibody against CD40 is effective in enhancing immune responses to vaccines when chemically conjugated to the vaccine antigen. Unfortunately the requirement for chemical conjugation presents some difficulties in vaccine production and quality control which are compounded when multivalent vaccines are required. We explore here an alternative to chemical conjugation, involving the co-encapsulation of CD40 antibody and antigens in liposomal vehicles.Anti-mouse CD40 mAb or isotype control mAb were co-entrapped individually in cationic liposomal vehicles with pneumococcal polysaccharides or diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. Retention of CD40 binding activity upon liposomal entrapment was assessed by ELISA and flow cytometry. After subcutaneous immunization of BALB/c female mice, anti-polysaccharide and DT/TT responses were measured by ELISA. Simple co-encapsulation of CD40 antibody allowed for the retention of CD40 binding on the liposome surface, and also produced vaccines with enhanced imunogenicity. Antibody responses against both co-entrapped protein in the form of tetanus toxoid, and Streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide, were enhanced by co-encapsulation with CD40 antibody. Surprisingly, liposomal encapsulation also appeared to decrease the toxicity of high doses of CD40 antibody as assessed by the degree of splenomegaly induced.Liposomal co-encapsulation with CD40 antibody may represent a practical means of producing more immunogenic multivalent vaccines and inducing IgG responses against polysaccharides without the need for conjugation."
https://openalex.org/W2023407481,"Ring1B is an essential member of the highly conserved Polycomb group proteins, which orchestrate developmental processes, cell growth and stem cell fate by modifying local chromatin structure. Ring1B was found to be the E3 ligase that monoubiquitinates histone H2A, which adds a new level of chromatin modification to Polycomb group proteins. Here we report that Ring1B belongs to the exclusive group of proteins that for their translation depend on a stable 5′ UTR sequence in their mRNA known as an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES). In cell transfection assays the Ring1B IRES confers significantly higher expression levels of Ring1B than a Ring1B cDNA without the IRES. Also, dual luciferase assays show strong activity of the Ring1B IRES. Although our findings indicate Ring1B can be translated under conditions where cap-dependent translation is impaired, we found the Ring1B IRES to be cap-dependent. This raises the possibility that translational control of Ring1B is a multi-layered process and that translation of Ring1B needs to be maintained under varying conditions, which is in line with its essential role as an E3 ligase for monoubiquitination of histone H2A in the PRC1 Polycomb protein complex."
https://openalex.org/W2171724851,"Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the main plant biotechnology gene transfer tool with host range which can be extended to non-plant eukaryotic organisms under laboratory conditions. Known medical cases of Agrobacterium species isolation from bloodstream infections necessitate the assessment of biosafety-related risks of A. tumefaciens encounters with mammalian organisms. Here, we studied the survival of A. tumefaciens in bloodstream of mice injected with bacterial cultures. Bacterial titers of 108 CFU were detected in the blood of the injected animals up to two weeks after intravenous injection. Agrobacteria carrying Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter-based constructs and isolated from the injected mice retained their capacity to promote green fluorescent protein (GFP) synthesis in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. To examine whether or not the injected agrobacteria are able to express in mouse organs, we used an intron-containing GFP (GFPi) reporter driven either by a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter or by a CaMV 35S promoter. Western and northern blot analyses as well as RT-PCR analysis of liver, spleen and lung of mice injected with A. tumefaciens detected neither GFP protein nor its transcripts. Thus, bacteraemia induced in mice by A. tumefaciens does not lead to detectible levels of genetic transformation of mouse organs."
https://openalex.org/W1977427372,"The study of protein evolution is complicated by the vast size of protein sequence space, the huge number of possible protein folds, and the extraordinary complexity of the causal relationships between protein sequence, structure, and function. Much simpler model constructs may therefore provide an attractive complement to experimental studies in this area. Lattice models, which have long been useful in studies of protein folding, have found increasing use here. However, while these models incorporate actual sequences and structures (albeit non-biological ones), they incorporate no actual functions—relying instead on largely arbitrary structural criteria as a proxy for function. In view of the central importance of function to evolution, and the impossibility of incorporating real functional constraints without real function, it is important that protein-like models be developed around real structure–function relationships. Here we describe such a model and introduce open-source software that implements it. The model is based on the structure–function relationship in written language, where structures are two-dimensional ink paths and functions are the meanings that result when these paths form legible characters. To capture something like the hierarchical complexity of protein structure, we use the traditional characters of Chinese origin. Twenty coplanar vectors, encoded by base triplets, act like amino acids in building the character forms. This vector-world model captures many aspects of real proteins, including life-size sequences, a life-size structural repertoire, a realistic genetic code, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure, structural domains and motifs, operon-like genetic structures, and layered functional complexity up to a level resembling bacterial genomes and proteomes. Stylus is a full-featured implementation of the vector world for Unix systems. To demonstrate the utility of Stylus, we generated a sample set of homologous vector proteins by evolving successive lines from a single starting gene. These homologues show sequence and structure divergence resembling those of natural homologues in many respects, suggesting that the system may be sufficiently life-like for informative comparison to biology."
