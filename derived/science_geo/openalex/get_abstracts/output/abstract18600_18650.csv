https://openalex.org/W2007263885,"The range of messenger action of a point source of Ca2+ or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) was determined from measurements of their diffusion coefficients in a cytosolic extract from Xenopus laevis oocytes. The diffusion coefficient (D) of [3H]IP3 injected into an extract was 283 microns 2/s. D for Ca2+ increased from 13 to 65 microns 2/s when the free calcium concentration was raised from about 90 nM to 1 microM. The slow diffusion of Ca2+ in the physiologic concentration range results from its binding to slowly mobile or immobile buffers. The calculated effective ranges of free Ca2+ before it is buffered, buffered Ca2+, and IP3 determined from their diffusion coefficients and lifetimes were 0.1 micron, 5 microns, and 24 microns, respectively. Thus, for a transient point source of messenger in cells smaller than 20 microns, IP3 is a global messenger, whereas Ca2+ acts in restricted domains."
https://openalex.org/W1624346216,"The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family encompasses four polypeptides that result from alternative splicing of mRNA. We have previously demonstrated differences in the secretion pattern of these polypeptides. Stable cell lines expressing VEGFs were established in human embryonic kidney CEN4 cells. VEGF121, the shortest form, was secreted and freely soluble in tissue culture medium. VEGF189 was secreted, but was almost entirely bound to the cell surface or extracellular matrix. VEGF165 displayed an intermediary behavior. Suramin induced the release of VEGF189, permitting its characterization as a more basic protein with higher affinity for heparin than VEGF165 or VEGF121, but with similar endothelial cell mitogenic activity. Heparin, heparan sulfate, and heparinase all induced the release of VEGF165 and VEGF189, suggesting heparin-containing proteoglycans as candidate VEGF-binding sites. Finally, VEGF165 and VEGF189 were released from their bound states by treatment with plasmin. The released 34-kDa dimeric species are active as endothelial cell mitogens and as vascular permeability agents. We conclude that the bioavailability of VEGF may be regulated at the genetic level by alternative splicing that determines whether VEGF will be soluble or incorporated into a biological reservoir and also through proteolysis following plasminogen activation."

https://openalex.org/W1587123510,"Two forms of cyclooxygenase are known to be present in eukaryotic organisms: a cyclooxygenase (COX-1) first purified from ram seminal vesicles encoded by a 2.8-kilobase mRNA, and a newly discovered mitogen-inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) encoded by a 4-kilobase mRNA. Expression of these two forms of the enzyme in rat alveolar macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide was investigated by 1) determining the activity of newly synthesized enzyme after inactivating the endogenous enzyme with aspirin; 2) comparing levels of newly synthesized enzyme proteins in cells treated with or without lipopolysaccharide; and 3) assessing the expression of the mRNAs encoding COX-1 and COX-2. Levels of enzyme proteins were assessed by Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled enzyme using two different antibodies, one specific for COX-2 and the other recognizing both forms of the enzyme but preferentially recognizing COX-1. We report here that the enhanced cyclooxygenase activity induced by the bacterial lipopolysaccharide in rat alveolar macrophages is caused by selective expression of the COX-2. Expression of COX-2 in macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide was completely inhibited by dexamethasone, whereas COX-1 was unaffected. In resting unstimulated macrophages, only COX-1 but not COX-2 was detected. Levels of mRNA for the COX-2 in macrophages were increased, but those of the COX-1 were not affected by lipopolysaccharide as assessed by reverse transcription coupled with polymerase chain reaction. These results indicate that increased synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages results from selective expression of COX-2."

But the characterization of molecules allowing motoneuron survival has been difficult. Ciliary neurotrophic factor prevents the death of motoneurons3–6, but its gene is not expressed during development7. Although the presence of a neurotrophin receptor on developing motoneurons8–10 has suggested a role for neurotrophins, none could be shown to promote motoneuron survival in vitro3. We report here that brain-derived neurotrophic factor can prevent the death of axotomized motoneurons in newborn rats, suggesting a role for this neurotrophin for motoneuron survival in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1983205909,"Impaired immune responses occur frequently in cancer patients or in tumor-bearing mice, but the mechanisms of the tumor-induced immune defects remain poorly understood. In an in vivo murine colon carcinoma model (MCA-38), animals bearing a tumor longer than 26 days develop CD8+ T cells with impaired cytotoxic function, decreased expression of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha and granzyme B genes, and decreased ability to mediate an antitumor response in vivo. T lymphocytes from tumor-bearing mice expressed T cell antigen receptors that contained low amounts of CD3 gamma and completely lacked CD3 zeta, which was replaced by the Fc epsilon gamma-chain. Expression of the tyrosine kinases p56lck and p59fyn was also reduced. These changes could be the basis of immune defects in tumor-bearing hosts."

Expression of R caused augmented anthocyanin pigmentation in both plant species and augmented trichome (hair) production in Arabidopsis. Alone, C1 had no effect. Hybrid transgenic Arabidopsis expressing both C1 and R produced anthocyanins in root, petal, and stamen tissues that normally never express anthrocyanins. When R was expressed in the transparent testa glabrous (without anthocyanins and trichomes) mutant of Arabidopsis, the deficiency was complemented and both anthocyanins and trichomes were restored."

https://openalex.org/W1578786377,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP) and gp330, two members of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family, share a multitude of cysteine-rich repeats. LRP has been shown to act as an endocytosis-mediating receptor for several ligands, including protease-antiprotease complexes and plasma lipoproteins. The former include alpha 2-macroglobulin-protease complexes and plasminogen activator inhibitor-activator complexes. The latter include chylomicron remnant-like particles designated beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) complexed with apoprotein E or lipoprotein lipase. The binding specificity of gp330 is unknown. In the current studies we show that gp330 from rat kidney membranes binds several of these ligands on nitrocellulose blots. We also show that both LRP and gp330 bind an additional ligand, bovine lactoferrin, which is known to inhibit the hepatic clearance of chylomicron remnants. Lactoferrin blocked the LRP-dependent stimulation of cholesteryl ester synthesis in cultured human fibroblasts elicited by apoprotein E-beta-VLDL or lipoprotein lipase-beta-VLDL complexes. Cross-competition experiments in fibroblasts showed that the multiple ligands recognize at least three distinct, but partially overlapping sites on the LRP molecule. Binding of all ligands to LRP and gp330 was inhibited by the 39-kDa protein, which co-purifies with the two receptors, suggesting that the 39-kDa protein is a universal regulator of ligand binding to both receptors. The correlation of the inhibitory effects of lactoferrin in vivo and in vitro support the notion that LRP functions as a chylomicron remnant receptor in liver. LRP and gp330 share a multiplicity of binding sites, and both may function as endocytosis-mediating receptors for a large number of ligands in different organs."
https://openalex.org/W1530529896,"The transport properties of mitochondria are such that net potassium flux across the inner membrane determines mitochondrial volume. It has been known that K+ uptake is mediated by diffusive leak driven by the high electrical membrane potential maintained by redox-driven, electrogenic proton ejection and that regulated K+ efflux is mediated by an 82-kDa inner membrane K+/H+ antiporter. There is also long-standing suggestive evidence for the existence of an inner membrane protein designed to catalyze electrophoretic K+ uptake into mitochondria. We report reconstitution of a highly purified inner membrane protein fraction from rat liver and beef heart mitochondria that catalyzes electrophoretic K+ flux in liposomes and channel activity in planar lipid bilayers. The unit conductance of the channel at saturating [K+] is about 30 pS. Reconstituted K+ flux is inhibited with high affinity by ATP and ADP in the presence of divalent cations and by glibenclamide in the absence of divalent cations. The mitochondrial ATP-dependent K+ channel is selective for K+, with a Km of 32 mM, and does not transport Na+. K+ transport depends on voltage in a manner consistent with a channel activity that is not voltage-regulated. Thus, the mitochondrial ATP-dependent K+ channel exhibits properties that are remarkably similar to those of the ATP-dependent K+ channels of plasma membranes."

https://openalex.org/W2064055178,"Class II major histocompatibility complexes bind peptides in an endosome-like compartment. When the class II null cell line 721.174 was transfected with class II DR3 genes, DR molecules were produced in normal amounts. However, the DR molecules were abnormally conformed and unstable because deletion of an antigen-processing gene had impaired intracellular formation of most class II-peptide complexes. Yet, 70 percent of the DR molecules still bore peptides, 80 percent of which were 21- to 24-amino acid fragments of the class II-associated invariant chain. These peptides were rare on DR3 from control cells. Thus, a defect in the main antigen-processing pathway revealed a process in which DR molecules bind long peptides derived from proteins present in the same compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1581923812,"Previously we reported the purification of the heparin-binding growth factor pleiotrophin (PTN) from supernatants of the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. To investigate further the biological activities of PTN and its potential role in cancer, we cloned a PTN cDNA and expressed the gene in a human kidney and in a human adrenal carcinoma cell line (SW-13). The supernatants harvested from cells transfected with PTN contained a heparin-binding specific protein of an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa. These supernatants stimulated the proliferation of endothelial cells as well as the anchorage-independent growth of SW-13 cells and of normal rat kidney fibroblasts. Furthermore, SW-13 cells transfected with PTN acquired autonomous growth in soft agar and were tumorigenic in athymic nude mice. In contrast to these results with PTN from human cells, PTN obtained from insect cells (Sf9) using recombinant baculovirus as a vector was biologically inactive. We detected high levels of PTN mRNA in 16 of 27 primary human breast cancer samples (62%) as well as in 8 of 8 carcinogen-induced rat mammary tumors. Furthermore, 9 of 34 human tumor cell lines of different origin showed detectable PTN mRNA. We conclude that PTN may function as a tumor growth and angiogenesis factor in addition to its role during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2056933632,"In order to function, transcription factors must compete for DNA binding with structural components of chromatin, including nucleosomes. Mechanisms that could be used in this competition have been characterized with the use of the DNA binding domain of the yeast GAL4 protein. The binding of GAL4 to a nucleosome core resulted in a ternary complex containing GAL4, the core histone proteins, and DNA. This ternary complex was unstable; upon the addition of nonspecific competitor DNA, it dissociated into either the original nucleosome core particle or GAL4 bound to naked DNA. Nucleosome core destabilization by GAL4 did not require a transcriptional activation domain. These data demonstrate the displacement of nucleosome cores as a direct result of binding by a regulatory factor. Similar mechanisms might affect the establishment of factor occupancy of promoters and enhancers in vivo."

This method is costly in terms of time and can lead to loss of stocks. Traditional slow freezing methods do not succeed because the embryos are highly sensitive to chilling. With the procedures described here, 68 percent of precisely staged 15-hour Oregon R (wild-type) embryos hatch after vitrification at -205 degrees C, and 40 percent of the resulting larvae develop into normal adult flies. These embryos are among the most complex organisms successfully preserved by cryobiology."
https://openalex.org/W2090445562,"The telomeres of Xq and Yq have been observed to associate during meiosis, and in rare cases a short synaptonemal complex is present. Molecular cloning of loci from Xqter and Yqter has revealed that their sequence homology extends over 400 kilobases, which suggests the possibility of genetic exchange. This hypothesis was tested by the development of two highly informative microsatellite markers from yeast artificial chromosome clones that carried Xqter sequences and the following of their inheritance in a set of reference pedigrees from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain in Paris, France. From a total of 195 informative male meioses, four recombination events between these loci were observed. In three cases, paternal X alleles were inherited by male offspring, and in one case a female offspring inherited her father's Y allele. These data support the existence of genetic exchange at Xq-Yq, which defines a second pseudoautosomal region between the sex chromosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1547867352,"Coagulation factor X is activated by the extrinsic Xase complex composed of factor VIIa associated with the integral membrane protein tissue factor. The kinetics of human factor X activation was studied following reconstitution of this reaction system using purified human proteins and synthetic phospholipid vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine (PCPS) or phosphatidylcholine alone (PC). Factor X activation was evaluated by discontinuous measurements of the amidolytic activity of the product, factor Xa, or continuously monitored using the fluorescent serine protease inhibitor 4-aminobenzamidine. The results of both techniques were verified by direct physical measurements of zymogen activation using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The rate of factor X activation with PC vesicles was less than 5% of that observed with PCPS vesicles. Since factor X does not bind to vesicles containing only PC, these data suggested an important role for the substrate-membrane interaction in the catalytic cycle. The importance of the substrate-membrane interaction in the activation process was investigated by using membrane-binding proteins to compete with the substrate for combining sites on PCPS vesicles. Prothrombin fragment 1 was an inhibitor of factor X activation. The dependence of inhibition by fragment 1 on PCPS and factor X was consistent with a significant reduction in initial velocity due to the displacement of factor X from the membrane surface. The inhibition data also suggested that the membrane-bound pool of factor X was the preferred substrate for the human extrinsic Xase complex. The influence of PCPS concentrations on the rate of factor X activation was systematically investigated. Increasing concentrations of PCPS resulted in a modest change in the Km,app and a dramatic change in the Vmax,app for the reaction. The initial velocity data could be globally analyzed according to the preferential utilization of membrane-bound factor X with the intrinsic kinetic constants: Km approximately equal to 1 microM and kcat = 37 s-1 at saturating PCPS. In addition, the equilibrium parameters for the factor X-membrane interaction inferred from these studies were in excellent agreement with the directly determined values. Collectively, the data suggest that the substrate-membrane interaction must precede catalysis for the efficient activation of human factor X by the extrinsic Xase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1498070030,"Mechanisms controlling Ca2+ fluxes through the plasma membrane of lymphocytes have been characterized in a human T-cell clone and in the Jurkat T-cell line. Due to endogenous buffers, about 1/125 of the Ca2+ ions that enter the cell are free. Ca2+ fluxes were estimated from the variations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) elicited by concentration jumps in extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]o). Thapsigargin was used to inhibit Ca2+ uptake into intracellular stores and to stimulate Ca2+ entry. Ca2+ extrusion was strictly due to the activity of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPases since there was no detectable Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity in these cells. The rate of Ca2+ extrusion was mainly influenced by [Ca2+]i and less by [Ca2+]o but was insensitive to cell depolarization. In depolarized cells, thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx was reduced to 10% of the value measured in normally polarized cells, suggesting that depolarization not only reduces the electrochemical gradient for Ca2+ ions, but also inhibits Ca2+ permeation. When Ca2+ ions enter the cell, they bind to a site inside the channel, with a Kd of 3.3 mM. Stimulation of clonal T-cells with low concentrations of either anti-CD3 antibodies or thapsigargin elicited Ca2+ oscillations. Both the amplitude and the frequency of CD3-induced Ca2+ oscillations were sensitive to [Ca2+]o. These oscillations were immediately interrupted when extracellular Ca2+ was removed. The properties of Ca2+ oscillations in T lymphocytes suggest that they are mainly due to variations of Ca2+ influx, modulated by variations in [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W1493153573,"Sphingomyelin or the products derived from its metabolism may constitute a signaling system involved in a variety of cellular processes. The activation of a plasma membrane neutral sphingomyelinase, which catalyzes the first step in sphingomyelin turnover, has been suggested to play an important role in cellular differentiation. We have studied the effect of exogenous staphylococcal sphingomyelinase on DNA synthesis and on the composition of membrane sphingolipids in quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Sphingomyelinase stimulated proliferation of Swiss 3T3 cells and potentiated the mitogenic action of other growth factors, such as insulin, epidermal growth factor, and bombesin. Treatment with sphingomyelinase produced a significant decrease in sphingomyelin accompanied by a corresponding increase in ceramide levels. No significant increases were detected in the levels of products derived from ceramide, i.e. ceramide 1-phosphate, sphingosine, or sphingosine 1-phosphate. To further investigate the role of ceramide in cellular proliferation, we studied the effect of cell-permeable analogs of ceramide on DNA synthesis in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells. Both N-hexanoylsphingosine and N-acetylsphingosine at low concentrations stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation and acted synergistically with a wide variety of growth factors known to induce proliferation of quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Similar effects were observed with bovine brain ceramides. These results suggest that ceramide may be involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2081019360,"The sunY ribozyme is derived from a self-splicing RNA group I intron. This ribozyme was chosen as a starting point for the design of a self-replicating RNA because of its small size. As a means of facilitating the self-replication process, the size of this ribozyme was decreased by the deletion of nonconserved structural domains; however, when such deletions were made, there were severe losses of enzymatic activity. In vitro genetic selection was used to identify mutations that reactivate a virtually inactive sunY deletion mutant. A selected mutant with five substitution mutations scattered throughout the primary sequence showed greater catalytic activity than the original ribozyme under the selection conditions. The sunY ribozyme and its small selected variant can both catalyze template-directed oligonucleotide assembly. The small size and reduced secondary structure of the selected variant results in an enhancement, relative to that of the original ribozyme, of its rate of self-copying. This engineered ribozyme is able to function effectively both as a catalyst and as a template in self-copying reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1991166687,"When template DNA is saturated with a single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB), strings of three or four contiguous hexanucleotides (hexamers) can cooperate through base-stacking interactions to prime DNA synthesis specifically from the 3' end of the string. Under the same conditions, priming by individual hexamers is suppressed. Strings of three of four hexamers representing more than 200 of the 4096 possible hexamers primed easily readable sequence ladders at more than 75 different sites in single-stranded or denatured double-stranded templates 6.4 kilobases to 40 kilobase pairs long, with a success rate of 60 to 90 percent. A synthesis of 1 micromole of hexamer supplies enough material for thousands of primings, so multiple libraries of all 4096 hexamers could be distributed at a reasonable cost. Such libraries would allow rapid and economical sequencing. Automating this strategy could increase the speed and efficiency of large-scale DNA sequencing by at least an order of magnitude."
https://openalex.org/W1502615843,"Annexin II tetramer (A-IIt) is a member of the annexin family of Ca2+ and phospholipid-binding proteins. The ability of this protein to aggregate both phospholipid vesicles and chromaffin granules has suggested a role for the protein in membrane trafficking events such as exocytosis. A-IIt is also a major intracellular substrate of both pp60src and protein kinase C; however, the effect of phosphorylation on the activity of this protein is unknown. In the current report we have examined the effect of phosphorylation on the lipid vesicle aggregation activity of the protein. Protein kinase C catalyzed the incorporation of 2.1 +/- 0.8 mol of phosphate/mol of A-IIt. Phosphorylation of A-IIt caused a dramatic decrease in the rate and extent of lipid vesicle aggregation without significantly effecting Ca(2+)-dependent lipid binding by the phosphorylated protein. Phosphorylation of A-IIt increased the A50%(Ca2+) of lipid vesicle aggregation from 0.18 microM to 0.65 mM. Activation of A-IIt phosphorylation, concomitant with activation of lipid vesicle aggregation, inhibited both the rate and extent of lipid vesicle aggregation but did not cause disassembly of the aggregated lipid vesicles. These results suggest that protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of A-IIt blocks the ability of the protein to aggregate phospholipid vesicles without affecting the lipid vesicle binding properties of the protein."

Transgenic mice were constructed that contained the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of two CNS-derived strains and a T cell tropic strain of HIV-1. Only mice generated with CNS-derived LTRs directed expression in the CNS, particularly in neurons.

https://openalex.org/W1495419857,"We studied the regulation of arachidonic acid (AA) release by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S) and Ca2+ in electropermeabilized HL60 granulocytes. Stimulation of AA release by GTP gamma S and Ca2+ was mediated by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and required the presence of MgATP (EC50: 100-250 microM). The nucleotide effects were Ca(2+)-dependent (maximal effects detected at 1 microM free cation). UTP and ATP gamma S, which stimulate AA release in intact HL60 granulocytes with potencies and efficacies similar to those of ATP, were ineffective in supporting the effects of GTP gamma S in electropermeabilized cells. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin affected stimulation of AA release by ATP in intact cell, without altering the nucleotide effects in permeabilized cells. We observed the protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of PLA2 in permeabilized HL60 granulocytes, together with a correlation between the effects of phorbol esters and staurosporine on this reaction and on AA release. ATP-independent activation of PLA2 by GTP gamma S and/or Ca2+ was measured in subcellular fractions prepared from HL60 granulocytes. These data appear consistent with a model in which PLA2 activity in resting HL60 granulocytes is subjected to an inhibitory constraint that prevents its activation by Ca2+ and G-proteins. Removal of this constraint, either by the protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of the enzyme in vivo or physical disruption of the regulatory assembly (e.g. by N2 cavitation), allows its activation by Ca2+ and G-proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1658388821,"Endothelial cell membranes, the site of the blood-brain barrier, were obtained from the capillaries of cow brain. The luminal and abluminal membranes were separated by centrifugation on a discontinuous Ficoll gradient. Electron microscopy revealed that the membrane preparations consisted almost entirely of sealed vesicles. The release of latent enzyme activity showed that both membrane preparations were primarily right side out. Radiolabeled L-phenylalanine uptake by luminal vesicles was proportional to membrane protein concentration, with less than 10% binding. Transport was by a high affinity carrier (Km 11.8 +/- 0.1 microM, asymptotic standard error) that showed little or no stereospecificity, and was independent of Na+ or H+ gradients. Transport was inhibited by L-tryptophan, L-leucine, 2-aminobicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylate and D-phenylalanine, but not by N-(methylamino)-isobutyrate. Abluminal membranes showed an additional component in which a Na+ gradient accelerated the transport of both phenylalanine and N-(methylamino)-isobutyrate. These studies demonstrate the utility of membrane vesicles as a model to characterize the transport properties of the distinct membranes of the polar endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2159077766,"Plasminogen, the zymogen form of the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin, is known to undergo plasmin-mediated modification in vitro. The modified form, Lys-plasminogen, is superior to the native Glu-plasminogen in fibrin binding and as a substrate for activation by tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). The present study was undertaken to determine the existence and significance of the Glu- to Lys-plasminogen conversion during t-PA-mediated lysis of plasma clots in vitro. When human plasma was supplemented with exogenous Lys-plasminogen and clotted, a dose-dependent shortening of lysis time was observed. Formation of Lys-plasminogen in situ during fibrinolysis was determined using 131I-Glu-plasminogen-supplemented plasma. By the time of lysis, Lys-plasminogen had accumulated to about 20% of the initial concentration of Glu-plasminogen. Quantitation of activation of both Glu- and Lys-plasminogen as well as the conversion of Glu- to Lys-plasminogen in plasma supplemented with both 131I-Glu-plasminogen and 125I-Lys-plasminogen was accomplished by determining the flux of the isotopically labeled species along three pathways: Glu-plasminogen-->Glu-plasmin, Glu-plasminogen-->Lys-plasminogen, and Lys-plasminogen-->Lys-plasmin. After a brief lag, the Glu-plasminogen activation rate was constant until lysis was achieved, at which point activation ceased. The Lys-plasminogen activation rate also was essentially constant until lysis but was not characterized by a lag phase. The rate of conversion of Glu- to Lys-plasminogen was nonlinear and correlated directly with the rate of fibrinolysis. By the time lysis had occurred, Glu-plasminogen consumption had been distributed equally between direct activation to plasmin and conversion to Lys-plasminogen, and 45% of the plasmin which had been formed was derived from Lys-plasminogen. These results demonstrate both the formation and the subsequent activation of Lys-plasminogen during fibrinolysis. As a result of improved fibrin binding and activation of Lys-plasminogen compared to Glu-plasminogen, the formation of Lys-plasminogen within a clot constitutes a positive feedback mechanism that can further stimulate the activation of plasminogen by t-PA as fibrinolysis progresses."
https://openalex.org/W1605729052,"The effects of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) on low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated cholesterol metabolism were evaluated in vascular smooth muscle cells. TGF-beta significantly increased the binding, uptake, and degradation of 125I-LDL. This increase was paralleled by an increase in LDL receptor mRNA steady state levels and an increase in cholesterol esterification. The increase in LDL cholesterol metabolism was independent of proliferation. LDL receptor expression in response to TGF-beta was not affected by coincubation with an antibody against platelet-derived growth factor or by cyclooxygenase inhibitors in arterial smooth muscle cells, suggesting that TGF-beta's effect was not mediated through platelet-derived growth factor or prostaglandins, as demonstrated in other cell systems. However, coincubation with pertussis toxin abrogated the effect of TGF-beta on LDL receptor expression, suggesting that a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein may be involved in the signal transduction pathway. These results are discussed in terms of their potential effects on cellular cholesterol trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W1977533931,"Nematode trans-spliced leader (SL) RNAs are composed of two domains, an exon [the 22-nucleotide spliced leader] and a small nuclear RNA (snRNA)-like sequence. Participation in vitro of the spliced leader RNA in trans-splicing reactions is independent of the exon sequence or size and instead depends on features contained in the snRNA-like domain of the molecule. Chemical modification interference analysis has revealed that two short sequence elements in the snRNA-like domain are necessary for SL RNA activity. These elements are sufficient for such activity because when added to a 72-nucleotide fragment of a nematode U1 snRNA, this hybrid RNA could participate in trans-splicing reactions in vitro. One of the critical sequence elements may function by base-pairing with U6 snRNA, an essential U snRNA for both cis- and trans-splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2140410752,"Capillary endothelial cells can be induced to form capillary-like structures in vitro by plating on fibronectin-coated dishes (Ingber, D. E., and Folkman, J. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 109, 317-330), thereby mimicking angiogenesis. To assess the role of glycoproteins bearing asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in this process, we tested the effect of oligosaccharide processing inhibitors on the formation of capillary tubes. Deoxymannojirimycin, a compound that prevents synthesis of hybrid and complex-type oligosaccharides, inhibited the formation of capillary tubes. In contrast, swainsonine, an inhibitor that blocks synthesis of complex- but not hybrid-type oligosaccharides, did not inhibit tube formation. Lectin affinity chromatography of 2-[3H] mannose-labeled glycopeptides from endothelial cells induced to form tubes did not reveal a striking difference in the spectrum of oligosaccharides compared to uninduced cells. Since endothelial cells formed tubes normally in the presence of swainsonine, we analyzed glycopeptides from swainsonine-treated induced and uninduced cells. Cells induced to form tubes were enriched in monosialylated hybrid-type oligosaccharides sensitive to alpha-fucosidase, beta-galactosidase, and beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase, suggestive of sialyl Lewis-X determinants. We used an enzyme-linked immunoassay to measure sialyl Lewis-X epitopes on capillary endothelial cells and found that both induced and uninduced cells expressed sialyl Lewis-X epitopes. Deoxymannojirimycin and, to a lesser extent, swainsonine reduced the level of sialyl Lewis-X epitopes in cells induced to form capillary tubes, but neither compound affected the level of epitopes in cell monolayers. We conclude that synthesis of at least hybrid-type oligosaccharides is required for capillary tube formation in vitro and that an increase in monosialylated, fucosylated glycans on asparagine-linked oligosaccharides occurs during this process."

We have now isolated genomic clones of the human PTN gene, characterized its promoter region, determined its transcription initiation site(s), and established functional activity of the PTN promoter. A fragment -550/+191 that contains a CAAT box, no apparent TATA box, and four consensus sites for the binding of MyoD is sufficient to provide optimal promoter activity. A serum response element is found at -559 to -568. We also have identified the human PTN gene on chromosome 7, band q33 and the mouse Ptn gene on chromosome 6, respectively. The data thus identify and characterize the 5' end of the PTN gene and its promoter region, suggest potential regions that may contribute to the regulation of its transcriptional activity, and localize the PTN gene in human and mouse chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1532839418,"Microsomes from sunflower seedlings were used to investigate the transition state coordinate for the C-24 methylation reaction that mediates phytosterol biosynthesis. They were then used to study structurally related cationic and uncharged compounds of the natural sterol substrate, which were designed to interfere with the reaction progress. The hypothetical reaction course is described to proceed through an Sn2 formation of an activated complex involving the initial production of a covalent structure with a dative bond (methyl from AdoMet attacks si-face of the 24,25-double bond of the sterol) and the secondary production of a series of high energy intermediates, the stabilization of which determines the final C-24 methylated product. Derivatives of lanosterol and cholesterol with a methyl, hydrogen, oxygen, or bromine atom introduced into the side chain and/or at C-3 in place of the natural nucleophile were studied as inhibitors that interfere with the formation of the hypothetical tertiary isopropylcarbinyl cation intermediate in the conversion of cycloartenal to 24(28)-methylene cycloartanol. The data indicate the most potent inhibitor is a sterol with an aziridine group attached to C-24(25), which mimics the bridged C-24(25) carbenium ion generated in the transition state, and the methyltransferase possesses two strategic sites: one that recognizes the proximal end of the sterol acting as a proton donor and the other that recognizes the distal end that acts as a proton acceptor. The best fit (binding/catalysis) involves a flat sterol (including substrate and inhibitor) with intact unsubstituted nucleophilic centers at C-3 and C-24 and a freely rotating side chain that can assume the pseudocyclic conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1499998624,"Previous investigations indicate that some forms of cataract may be due to the reactions of isocyanate with lens proteins. The present investigation was directed toward identifying the products of these reactions and determining rate constants for their formation. Bovine alpha-crystallins were incubated with isocyanate and separated into alpha A- and alpha B-crystallins by reversed-phase HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography). Products of the reaction of isocyanate with alpha-crystallins were analyzed by mass spectrometry and isoelectric focusing. Proteolytic digests of carbamylated alpha A were analyzed by HPLC and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry to determine the extent of reaction of each of the 7 lysyl residues present in alpha A. These results demonstrate that incubation of alpha-crystallins in 0.1 M KNCO leads to partial carbamylation of all 7 lysines of alpha A-crystallin. The extent of modification after 24 h of incubation varied from 7% at Lys 88 to 61% at Lys 11. Rate constants for the reaction of specific lysyl residues with isocyanate ranged from 5 to 54 x 10(-2) M-1 h-1. The distribution of reaction products, as determined by isoelectric focusing, indicates that the physiologically relevant initial stages of carbamylation of the 7 lysyl residues of alpha A proceed in a noncooperative manner."
https://openalex.org/W1624187237,"Human Rhnull red blood cells fail to react with Rh antibodies, indicating that these cells are either devoid of Rh protein or, like other species, possess antigenically distinct variants. To determine whether Rhnull cells possess an Rh-like polypeptide, 32-kDa proteins from D–, rr, and Rhnull cells were labeled with the cysteine-specific probe, 125I-labeled pyridyldithioethylamine. Size comparisons of labeled proteins in Triton X-100-solubilized membranes from Rh-bearing and Rhnull cells showed similar sedimentation coefficients and Stoke's radii. Immunoprecipitated Rh(D) from D– cells, Rh(c) from rr cells, and purified 32-kDa proteins from Rhnull cells were digested with alpha-chymotrypsin and examined by high-performance liquid chromatography and by two-dimensional iodopeptide mapping. Analysis of 125I-labeled chymotryptic fragments from immunoprecipitated Rh(D) and Rh(c) showed the labeled peptides from both phenotypes to be virtually identical. High-performance liquid chromatography profiles and iodopeptide maps of 32-kDa Rhnull proteins yielded patterns identical to 32-kDa proteins isolated from D– cells and rr cells with the exception of one missing 125I-labeled peptide. Further analysis of the Rh-related fragments from Rhnull cells showed significant homology with immunoprecipitated Rh(D) and Rh(c). DNA sequence analysis of cysteine-encoding regions from Rh-bearing and Rhnull cells showed complete identity. These data suggest that Rhnull red blood cells, although serologically distinct, possess an Rh-like protein that is structurally very similar to Rh(D) and Rh(c)."
https://openalex.org/W1500996642,"Antipeptide antibodies were used to detect, purify, and characterize nonfilament F-pilin in the cell envelope of an F'tra+ strain of Escherichia coli. Affinity-purified goat antibodies raised against a peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal 14 amino acids of F-pilin detected F-pilin in immuno-overlay (Western) blots of electrophoretically separated inner and outer membrane proteins. As expected, the molecule was absent from inner membrane preparations of F- or F'traA[Am] strains. Immunoreactive material was purified from inner membrane fractions and shown to be F-pilin by amino acid analysis. The anti-peptide antibodies also detected membrane forms of F-pilin produced by cells containing plasmid pTG801 (Grossman, T. & Silverman, P. (1989) J. Bacteriol. 171, 650-656). Most cell envelope pilin was in the inner membrane fraction, but a significant quantity fractionated with the outer membrane as well. The hydropathy profile of F-pilin suggested that the molecule is an integral membrane protein with two membrane-spanning domains. In confirmation, F-pilin and pTG801 pilins in inner membrane preparations were solubilized by a single extraction with the nonionic detergents Nonidet P-40 (2%) or Triton X-100 (2%), but not by 2 M KCl or 0.1 M NaOH. Moreover, analysis of traA'-'phoA constructs indicated that both the amino and carboxyl termini of F-pilin face the periplasm. The periplasmic location of the amino terminus was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy of spheroplasts from F' and pTG801 strains, using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an amino-terminal epitope. These data suggest a specific structure for membrane F-pilin. We discuss that structure in relation to the probable structure of filament F-pilin."
https://openalex.org/W1615804488,"Abstract The concentration of Ca2+ that produced 50% of the saturable intrinsic fluorescence change (C50) of wild-type (wt) recombinant (r) human protein C (PC) was 0.40 mM. The C50 for Ca2+ increased Asp]r-PC, [Gla7-->Asp]r-PC, [Gla14-->Asp]r-PC, [Gla19-->Asp]r-PC, or [Gla25-->Asp]r-PC, and approximately 4-6-fold for [Gla20-->Asp]r-PC and [Gla29-->Asp]r-PC. Much more dramatic increases in the C50 for Ca2+ were observed for [Gla16-->Asp]r-PC (> 75-fold) and [Gla26-->Asp]r-PC (ca. 30-fold). A substantially larger maximum fluorescence change (> 3-fold) as compared to that for wtr-PC, was also found in the case of the Ca2+/[Gla16-->Asp]r-PC complex, suggesting that the final Ca(2+)-induced conformation for this variant is dissimilar to that for wtr-PC and the above mutants. When a mutation was constructed at Arg15 ([Arg15-->Leu]r-PC), a residue conserved in all Gla-containing coagulation proteins, no fluorescence alteration occurred upon addition of Ca2+. The C50 for Ca2+ for promotion of the binding of the Ca(2+)-dependent, Gla-domain-directed, conformational monoclonal antibodies, JTC-1 and JTC-3, to wtr-PC was 3.0 and 4.0 mM, respectively. A similar C50 value was found for [Gla25-->Asp]r-PC. In the case of each antibody, approximately 4-6-fold higher C50 values for Ca2+ were found for the mutants; [Gla14-->Asp]r-PC, [Gla19-->Asp]r-PC, and [Gla29-->Asp]r-PC. Ca2+ did not promote binding of either of these antibodies to the following variants; [Gla6-->Asp]r-PC, [Gla7-->Asp] r-PC, [Arg15-->Leu]r-PC, [Gla16-->Asp]r-PC, [Gla20-->Asp]r-PC, and [Gla26-->Asp]r-PC. The results of this study suggest that adoption of the Ca(2+)-dependent conformation of PC is greatly dependent upon the presence of specific essential Gla residues, particularly those, namely Gla16 and Gla26, shown in the crystal structure of the prothrombin Gla domain/Ca2+ complex to be involved with coordination of Ca2+ ions not exposed to the surface. Of similar importance is Arg15. On the other hand, Gla residues at positions 14 and 19 are much less important in directing this same conformation. This finding is readily reconciled with the above crystal structure, which shows that these latter 2 residues are mainly responsible for coordination of a surface-exposed Ca2+ that is present at the end of the Ca(2+)-ion channel."
https://openalex.org/W2086395365,"The parasitic nematode Ascaris infests a billion people worldwide. Much of its proliferative success is due to prodigious egg production, up to 10(6) sterol-replete eggs per day. Sterol synthesis requires molecular oxygen for squalene epoxidation, yet oxygen is scarce in the intestinal folds the worms inhabit. Ascaris has an oxygen-avid hemoglobin in the perienteric fluid that bathes its reproductive organs. Purified hemoglobin contained tightly bound squalene and functioned as an NADPH-dependent, ferrihemoprotein reductase. All components of the squalene epoxidation reaction--squalene, oxygen, NADPH, and NADPH-dependent reductase--are assembled on the hemoglobin. This molecule may thus function in sterol biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1510845258,"The T-cell receptor (TCR) is a multisubunit complex consisting of the clonotypic Ti alpha and beta (or Ti gamma and delta) subunits and the invariant CD3 gamma, CD3 delta, CD3 epsilon, CD3 zeta, and CD3 eta subunits. Herein, we describe an additional product from the CD3 zeta/eta gene locus which we have termed CD3 theta. The cDNA derives from the first seven exons common to CD3 zeta and CD3 eta, 94 base pairs (bp) of the CD3 eta-specific exon 9 and an additional exon 10 encoding the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids and the 3'-untranslated region. The expression of CD3 theta is equivalent to that of CD3 eta in tissue distribution and level of expression as judged by RNase protection analysis. Despite the identity of the amino-terminal 121 amino acids of CD3 zeta, CD3 eta, and CD3 theta and an additional 31 amino acids shared between CD3 eta and CD3 theta, transfection of CD3 theta into the CD3 zeta- eta- T-cell hybridoma, MA5.8, failed to restore detectable surface TCR expression in contrast to transfection with CD3 zeta or CD3 eta. Analysis of the CD3 theta protein in transfectants indicated that CD3 theta is associated with the TCR intracellularly. However, unlike with CD3 zeta, Ti alpha-beta chains remain endoglycosidase H sensitive, suggesting a role for the unique COOH-terminal segment of CD3 theta in mediating TCR retention and/or degradation in a pre-Golgi compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1529545807,"Monoclonal antibodies specific for the rod region can affect smooth muscle myosin's motor properties. Actin movement by phosphorylated myosin was inhibited by an antibody (LMM.4) which binds to the COOH-terminal end of the coiled-coil rod, a region thought to be involved in filament assembly. The actin-activated ATPase activity of the myosin-antibody LMM.4 complex was also reduced 10-fold at actin concentrations that gave maximal turnover rates with filamentous myosin. Metal-shadowing of the phosphorylated myosin-antibody complex at low ionic strength showed small bundles of parallel extended molecules, instead of filaments. Five other anti-rod antibodies had little or no effect on myosin's ability to act as a motor. This is the first demonstration that a muscle myosin's activity is affected by its state of assembly. A common theme that emerges from the studies on both muscle and non-muscle myosins is that assembly into a filamentous structure stimulates the activity of the individual myosin molecules."
