https://openalex.org/W1988271142,"Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4 or GKLF) is an inhibitor of the cell cycle. The gene encoding KLF4 is localized on chromosome 9q, previously shown to exhibit allelic loss in colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we show that the mean level of KLF4 mRNA in a panel of 30 CRC was 52% that of paired normal colonic tissues. Similarly, the levels of KLF4 mRNA and protein in a panel of six established CRC cell lines were significantly lower than those of an untransformed colonic epithelial cell line. Using highly polymorphic DNA markers that flank the KLF4 locus, we found evidence for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in two of eight surgically resected CRC specimens. In addition, LOH was observed in five of six CRC cell lines with one additional cell line exhibiting hemizygous deletion in the KLF4 gene. We also found that the 5'-untranslated region of KLF4 was hypermethylated in a subset of resected CRC specimens and cell lines. Lastly, the open-reading frame of KLF4 in two of three CRC cell lines examined contained several point mutations that resulted in a diminished ability to activate the p21(WAF1/Cip1) promoter. These findings indicate that KLF4 is a potential tumor suppressor gene in CRC."

One of these is Aurora-B, a key kinase that is required for chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate and for cytokinesis in mammalian cells. We report here that human Aurora-B is phosphorylated at Thr-232 through interaction with the inner centromere protein (INCENP) in vivo. The phosphorylation of Thr-232 occurs by means of an autophosphorylation mechanism, which is indispensable for the Aurora-B kinase activity. The activation of Aurora-B spatio-temporally correlated with the site-specific phosphorylation of its physiological substrates, histone H3 and vimentin. Overexpression of the TA mutant of Aurora-B, in which Thr-232 was changed into alanine, frequently induced multinuclearity in cells. These results indicate that the phosphorylation of Thr-232 is an essential regulatory mechanism for Aurora-B activation.

Drosophila Aurora- and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ipl1p-like protein kinases form an evolutionarily conserved family of enzymes from budding yeast to mammals (1Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Although the yeast genome encodes only one kinase, mammals have at least three subfamilies of Aurora/Ipl1p-related kinases. Among these kinases, Aurora-B (also called Aurora 1 or AIM-1) functions in both early and late mitotic events, including chromosome congression to the spindle equator, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis (1Nigg E.A.

Aurora-B directly binds INCENP, the first chromosomal passenger protein to be described, and INCENP is required to correctly target Aurora-B to centromeres and the central spindle (14Adams R.R.

S. cerevisiae Ipl1p phosphorylates S. cerevisiae INCENP Sli15p, and the binding of Sli15p and Ipl1p produces an increase in Ipl1p kinase activity (16Kang J.-s. Cheeseman I.M. Kallstrom G.

It was also found that Caenorhabditis elegans Aurora-B AIR-2 specifically phosphorylates the C. elegans INCENP ICP-1 and phosphorylated ICP-1 up-regulates the AIR-2 activity in vitro (8Bishop J.D. Schumacher J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27577-27580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We recently observed the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10 and Ser-28 when Aurora-B is co-expressed with INCENP, indicating that Aurora-B is activated through its interaction with INCENP in vivo as well as in vitro (13Kawajiri A. Yasui Y. Goto H. Tatsuka M. Takahashi M. Nagata K.-i. Inagaki M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1489-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which Aurora-B is activated after the association with INCENP remained unclear. We report here evidence that human Aurora-B is phosphorylated at Thr-232 through interaction with the INCENP in vivo. This phosphorylation of Thr-232 occurs by means of an autophosphorylation mechanism and is essential for the Aurora-B kinase activity. Mass Spectrometry—Silver-stained protein bands were in-gel digested by trypsin. For peptide sequencing by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, samples were analyzed on a Q-TOF Ultima quadrupole time-of-flight instrument (Waters Ltd.). Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7, HeLa, and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-expressing T24 (17Yasui Y. Amano M. Nagata K.-i. Inagaki N. Nakamura H. Saya H. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. These cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). For Aurora-B and INCENP introduced into COS-7, the cells were transfected with expression plasmids for Aurora-B and INCENP at the rate of 1:10. Twenty-four or 48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed for immunocytochemical studies. In some experiments, 48 h after transfection, the mitotic cells were prepared as described (17Yasui Y. Amano M. Nagata K.-i. Inagaki N. Nakamura H. Saya H. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and incubated for 3 h to allow for cell cycle progression. Intermediate filament (IF) bridge formation and multinuclear cells were analyzed immunocytochemically. Metabolic labeling was carried out by the addition of 0.1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h in phosphate-free medium. Immunofluorescence and Antibodies—The transfected cells or cells grown on glass slips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and then treated with methanol at -20 °C for 10 min or with 0.1% Triton-X100 at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then with secondary antibodies for 2 h at 37 °C. The DNAs were stained with 0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide or 0.5 μg/ml 4′6-diamideine-phenylindole-dihydrochloride. An anti-pT232 antibody (pAB2.1) was generated by immunizing mice with the synthetic peptide SLRRKTpMCGTLC. The following antibodies were used for indirect immunocytochemistry: pT232 mouse mAb (pAB2.1) diluted 1:100, αPH10 (anti-phospho-Ser-10 on histone H3) rabbit pAb (6Goto H. Yasui Y. Nigg E.A.

Gene Construction—Wild type or KR mutant Myc-Aurora-B has been reported (6Goto H. Yasui Y. Nigg E.A. Inagaki M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Aurora-B TA (T232A) and TE (T232E) were mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Wild type or mutant HA-INCENP was introduced in mammalian expression vector pCMV. INCENP Δ1 (residues 509-880), Δ2 (residues 729-880), and Δ3 (residues 1-834) were obtained by PCR from pCMV-INCENP-HA. For the INCENP SA (S861A and S862A) mutants, XbaI fragment was generated by PCR with oligonucleotide mutation primers, and then the fragment was replaced by the corresponding XbaI fragment in clone pCMV-INCENP-HA. pEGFP-Aurora-B TA and -INCENP SA were constructed by inserting a fragment of Aurora-B TA clone into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) and by inserting the HindIII-XhoI fragment of INCENP-SA clone into the HindIII-SalI sites of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), respectively. Wild type or mutant vimentin, with mutations at Aurora-B phosphorylation sites, have been described elsewhere (12Goto H. Yasui Y. Kawajiri A. Nigg E.A. Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Nagata K.-i. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8526-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Aurora-B Kinase and Binding Assay—Mammalian cell extracts were prepared in buffer: 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture. Cleared supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc or anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) followed by Western blotting. In some experiments, immunocomplex Aurora-B kinase assays were carried out at 25 °C for 20 min in buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 100 μm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 μm calyculin A) containing 50 μg of histone H3 as a substrate. The kinase activities were detected by Western blot analysis with αPH10 or HTA28 antibody. To further examine the mechanism of Aurora-B activation, we first studied the phosphorylation state of Aurora-B during the cell cycle (Fig. 1A). Endogenous Aurora-B was immunoprecipitated from corcemide-treated or untreated HeLa cells metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. This system revealed that the expression of Aurora-B was induced during mitosis as described (19Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P. Clairvoyant F.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and that Aurora-B was phosphorylated in vivo. Next, we identified the in vivo phosphorylation sites of human Aurora-B using mass spectrometry. This analysis identified phosphorylation sites in Aurora-B, including Thr-232 within the activation loop of the catalytic domain of the kinase (data not shown). Thr-232 of human Aurora-B is an equivalent residue of Thr-288 of human Aurora-A and Thr-260 of budding yeast Ipl1p, both of which are known to be phosphorylated in vivo (21Francisco L. Wang W. Chan C.S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4731-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 22Walter A.O. Seghezzi W. Korver W. Sheung J. Lees E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4906-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 23Cheeseman I.M. Anderson S. Jwa M. Green E.M. Kang J.-s. Yates III, J.R. Chan C.S.M. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Cell. 2002; 111: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). We examined the significance of the phosphorylation of Thr-232 of Aurora-B in this study, and for this, we generated an anti-phosphoT232 (pT232) antibody, the specificity of which was confirmed in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assays (Fig. 1B). We have previously reported that the bacterially produced glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Aurora-B was able to efficiently phosphorylate histone H3 (6Goto H. Yasui Y. Nigg E.A. Inagaki M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and type 3 intermediate filaments including vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and desmin (12Goto H. Yasui Y. Kawajiri A. Nigg E.A. Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Nagata K.-i. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8526-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 13Kawajiri A. Yasui Y. Goto H. Tatsuka M. Takahashi M. Nagata K.-i. Inagaki M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1489-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) in vitro, and therefore, GST-Aurora-B was thought to be in an active state. The anti-pT232 antibody reacted with GST-Aurora-B, suggesting that GST-Aurora-B is phosphorylated at Thr-232 (Fig. 1C). The reactivity against GST-Aurora-B was abolished after the treatment of GST-Aurora-B with the λ protein phosphatase (λ-PPase, a dual specificity phosphatase) or after the incubation of the antibody with the PT232 peptide antigen (Fig. 1C), which further indicated the specificity of the antibody. The anti-pT232 antibody reacted with mitotic Aurora-B, confirming that Thr-232 of Aurora-B is phosphorylated during mitosis in vivo (Fig. 1D). In mitosis, ∼90% of Aurora-B is phosphorylated at Thr-232 (data not shown). As described earlier, we recently demonstrated that the co-expression of Aurora-B and INCENP results in Aurora-B activation in vivo (13Kawajiri A. Yasui Y. Goto H. Tatsuka M. Takahashi M. Nagata K.-i. Inagaki M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1489-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Using this co-expression system, we examined the phosphorylation state of Thr-232 when Aurora-B is activated (Fig. 2A). When only wild type Aurora-B was overexpressed, phosphorylation of Thr-232 was not observed. In contrast, when wild type Aurora-B and wild type INCENP were co-expressed, marked phosphorylation of Thr-232 was detected, thereby indicating that the phosphorylation of Thr-232 is associated with the activation state of Aurora-B. Next, the kinase-inactive mutant of Aurora-B (KR), which has a mutation at the ATP binding site, and wild type INCENP were co-expressed. In this case, we found no phosphorylation of Thr-232, suggesting that Thr-232 by itself is phosphorylated by Aurora-B (i.e. autophosphorylation). The frequency of detection of pT232-positive cells after these transfections is shown in Fig. 2B. The reactivity of the anti-pT232 antibody in the cell staining was abolished by the preincubation of the antibody with the PT232 synthetic peptide antigen but not with the T232 synthetic peptide (Fig. 2C), confirming the specificity of the anti-pT232 antibody in the immunofluorescence study. To further confirm these results obtained by the immunostaining, we performed the immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 2D) and in vitro phosphorylation assay (Fig. 2, D and E). We co-transfected Myc-tagged Aurora-B and HA-tagged INCENP and then immunoprecipitated Myc-Aurora-B (Fig. 2D). Immunoprecipitated Myc-Aurora-B was phosphorylated at Thr-232 and was able to phosphorylate histone H3 at Ser-10 and Ser-28 in vitro, whereas immunoprecipitated Myc-Aurora-B KR was not phosphorylated at Thr-232 and was unable to phosphorylate histone H3. In vitro phosphorylation assay showed that recombinant GST-Aurora-B was phosphorylated at Thr-232 and was able to phosphorylate histone H3, whereas recombinant GST-Aurora-B KR was not phosphorylated at Thr-232 and was unable to phosphorylate histone H3 (Fig. 2D). In addition, GST-Aurora-B was able to directly phosphorylate MBP-Aurora-B KR at Thr-232 in vitro (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that when Aurora-B is activated through association with INCENP, the phosphorylation of Thr-232 occurs through autophosphorylation. In the next set of experiments, we determined whether the phosphorylation of Thr-232 of Aurora-B is important for Aurora-B kinase activity (Fig. 3). When wild type INCENP and wild type Aurora-B were co-expressed, the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10 and Ser-28 occurred, thereby indicating the activation of Aurora-B (Fig. 3, A and B). When wild type INCENP and TA mutant of Aurora-B, in which Thr-232 was changed to alanine, were co-expressed, the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10 and Ser-28 was not detected (Fig. 3, A and B). This indicates that the TA mutant is kinase-dead in vivo. We next examined whether the replacement of Thr-232 with Glu (TE mutant) might elevate the kinase activity. Aurora-B TE mutant, however, was not active even when it was co-expressed with INCENP (Fig. 3C), suggesting that Aurora-B TE was not able to mimic the activated Aurora-B. To further clarify the effect of Thr-232 phosphorylation on the activation of Aurora-B, we examined the kinase activity of the TA mutant of Aurora-B. As shown in Fig. 3D, when wild type INCENP and wild type Aurora-B were co-expressed, immunoprecipitated Aurora-B was phosphorylated at Thr-232 and could phosphorylate histone H3 at Ser-10 and Ser-28 in vitro. In contrast, when wild type INCENP and TA mutant of Aurora-B were co-expressed, immunoprecipitated TA mutant of Aurora-B could not phosphorylate histone H3 in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest that Thr-232 phosphorylation of Aurora-B is indispensable for the activation of Aurora-B. It was reported that C. elegans INCENP is phosphorylated at serines 598 and 599 (Ser-598/Ser-599) by Aurora-B and then increases Aurora-B kinase activity in vitro (8Bishop J.D. Schumacher J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27577-27580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We next examined the effects of the phosphorylation of mouse INCENP at Ser-861/Ser-862, which are equivalent residues of Ser-598/Ser-599 of C. elegans INCENP, on Aurora-B activity in vivo. To this end, we co-transfected wild type Aurora-B and various INCENP mutants (Fig. 4A) and then checked the Thr-232 phosphorylation of Aurora-B and Ser-28 phosphorylation of histone H3 (pS28) (Fig. 4, B and C). Among the co-transfection of INCENP Δ1, Δ2, or Δ3 mutants with Aurora-B, that of INCENP Δ3 resulted in a marked decrease in the frequency of pT232- and pS28-positive cells as compared with the co-transfection with wild type INCENP and Aurora-B. This indicates that the carboxyl-terminal IN-box domain of INCENP, containing the Aurora-B binding domain and Aurora-B phosphorylation sites, is indispensable for Aurora-B activation in vivo and that the NH2-terminal domain of INCENP has mild effects on the activation of Aurora-B. When the SA mutant of INCENP, in which serine residues of Aurora-B phosphorylation sites were changed to alanine (S861A/S862A), was co-expressed with Aurora-B, the phosphorylation of Thr-232 and Ser-28 markedly decreased. In contrast, the co-transfection of INCENP Δ1 SA or Δ2 SA and Aurora-B resulted in only mild reduction of pT232- and pS28-positive cells as compared with the co-transfection with INCENP Δ1 or Δ2 and Aurora-B, respectively. These results indicate that the phosphorylation of the IN-box domain is important for the “full-length” INCENP to activate Aurora-B, although the phosphorylation of the IN-box domain is not so necessary for the INCENP lacking its amino-terminal domain to activate Aurora-B. We next asked whether the binding between Aurora-B and INCENP was regulated by their phosphorylations (Fig. 4D). After wild type or the TA mutant Aurora-B was co-transfected with wild type or SA mutant INCENP, co-immunoprecipitation of INCENP with Aurora-B was detected. When wild type Aurora-B and SA mutant INCENP were co-transfected, Thr-232 phosphorylation of Aurora-B moderately decreased as compared with that of the co-transfection of wild type Aurora-B and wild type INCENP. We detected no differences in affinities between wild type or TA mutant Aurora-B and wild type or SA mutant INCENP. Thus, the phosphorylation of Aurora-B and INCENP may not affect their interaction. We examined the subcellular localization of activated Aurora-B during the cell cycle, using an anti-pT232 antibody (Fig. 5). We first compared the subcellular distribution of Aurora-B and that of Thr-232-phosphorylated Aurora-B (Fig. 5A). Aurora-B expression is induced at the late G2 phase as described, and pT232 is also detected at the late G2 phase. Activated Aurora-B has a general chromosomal localization in G2 and prophase, moves to chromosomal centromeres during prometaphase and metaphase, and subsequently relocates to the spindle midzone during anaphase and telophase. We next observed the subcellular distribution of Aurora-A, another essential Aurora family kinase (Fig. 5B). As described earlier, activated Aurora-A is phosphorylated at Thr-288 (22Walter A.O. Seghezzi W. Korver W. Sheung J. Lees E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4906-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and can be detected by anti-pT288 Aurora-A antibody. In contrast to Aurora-B, activated Aurora-A was first detected in prophase and was found to localize to centrosomes and bipolar mitotic spindle poles. We further checked whether the activation of Aurora-B spatio-temporally correlated with the phosphorylation of its physiological substrates, histone H3 and vimentin. For this, we compared the subcellular distribution of pT232 and that of pS10 of histone H3 (Fig. 5C). pS10 was observed in the pT232-positive area, where Aurora-B was activated, from late G2 to metaphase. Recently, we demonstrated that Aurora-B phosphorylates vimentin at Ser-72, which may play an important role in the segregation of vimentin filaments during cytokinesis (12Goto H. Yasui Y. Kawajiri A. Nigg E.A. Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Nagata K.-i. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8526-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We observed the subcellular distribution of pT232 and Ser-72-phosphorylated vimentin (pS72) (Fig. 5D). In this case, the localization of pT232 substantially overlapped with that of pS72 from anaphase to cytokinesis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that activated Aurora-B spatio-temporarily phosphorylates histone H3 from the late G2 to metaphase and vimentin from anaphase to cytokinesis. Since the overexpression of kinase-inactive Aurora-B (KR) or wild type Aurora-B is reported to disrupt cleavage furrow formation without affecting nuclear division, leading to multinucleate cells (20Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 24Tatsuka M. Katayama H. Ota T. Tanaka T. Odashima S. Suzuki F. Terada Y. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4811-4816PubMed Google Scholar), we checked whether the overexpression of the TA mutant of Aurora-B induces multinuclearity (Fig. 5E). Overexpression of the TA mutant frequently induced multinuclearity in cells, suggesting that the phosphorylation of Thr-232 and activation of Aurora-B is necessary to exert its function during cytokinesis. On the other hand, the overexpression of INCENP SA mutant did not produce multinucleate cells (Fig. 5E). Because the INCENP SA mutant can partially activate Aurora-B as described in Fig. 3, the overexpression of INCENP SA mutant might not completely perturb the Aurora-B function. To further investigate the mechanism related to the formation of multinucleate cells due to the impairment of Aurora-B activity, we examined the phenotype of the overexpression of vimentin mutants, in which phosphorylation sites by Aurora-B were changed to alanine or glycine (Fig. 5F). The overexpression of vimentin mutant in T24 cells caused not only the inhibition of segregation of vimentin into daughter cells but also multinuclearity. This suggests that the formation of multinucleate cells expressing the TA mutant of Aurora-B may partly result from disorganization of vimentin filament segregation in cytokinetic processes. Our evidence shows that Aurora-B is phosphorylated at Thr-232 through association with INCENP and then is activated. It was reported that human Aurora-B forms complexes with the protein serine/threonine phosphatase type 1 (PP1) or PP2, and these phosphatases may negatively regulate Aurora-B kinase activity (25Sugiyama K. Sugiura K. Hara T. Sugimoto K. Shima H. Honda K. Furukawa K. Yamashita S. Urano T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3103-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of the Thr-232 phosphorylation state of Aurora-B is crucial for kinase activity and function. These observations pave the way for ongoing research on upstream regulators and downstream targets of Aurora-B as well as for a better understanding of the role of Aurora-B in carcinogenesis. We are grateful to M. Ohara (Fukuoka, Japan) for language assistance and critical comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2004131152,"Activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) by VEGF leads to the activation of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)2/p38 and then to actin polymerization and reorganization into stress fibers in endothelial cells. In turn, this triggers endothelial cell migration. Yet, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms that couple VEGFR2 to SAPK2/p38. Here, we found that VEGF increased by twofold the activity of the small GTPase Cdc42 and that the expression of two different constitutively active forms of Cdc42 (Cdc42 V12 and Cdc42 L61) led to a marked increase in the formation of stress fibers that was sensitive to SAPK2/p38 inhibition by SB203580. Moreover, the expression of a dominant-negative form of Cdc42 (Cdc42 N17) inhibited the activation of SAPK2/p38 and of its direct target MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2. These results indicate that Cdc42 is upstream of SAPK2/p38 in response to the activation of VEGFR2 by VEGF. In contrast, we found that neither RhoA nor Rac was involved in the SAPK2/p38-mediated actin reorganization induced by VEGF. Using a site-specific mutant of the major autophosphorylation site Y1214 on VEGFR2, we found that the mutant Y1214F inhibited the activation of both Cdc42 and SAPK2/p38 in response to VEGF. We conclude that phosphorylation of Y1214 on VEGFR2 is required to trigger the sequential activation of Cdc42 and SAPK2/p38 and to drive the SAPK2/p38-mediated actin remodeling in stress fibers in endothelial cells exposed to VEGF."

https://openalex.org/W2057261483,"Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases are lysosomal storage disorders that result from an inherited deficiency of β-hexosaminidase A (αβ). Whereas the acute forms are associated with a total absence of hexosaminidase A and early death, the chronic adult forms exist with activity and protein levels of ∼5%, and unaffected individuals have been found with only 10% of normal levels. Surprisingly, almost all disease-associated missense mutations do not affect the active site of the enzyme but, rather, inhibit its ability to obtain and/or retain its native fold in the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in its retention and accelerated degradation. By growing adult Tay-Sachs fibroblasts in culture medium containing known inhibitors of hexosaminidase we have raised the residual protein and activity levels of intralysosomal hexosaminidase A well above the critical 10% of normal levels. A similar effect was observed in fibroblasts from an adult Sandhoff patient. We propose that these hexosaminidase inhibitors function as pharmacological chaperones, enhancing the stability of the native conformation of the enzyme, increasing the amount of hexosaminidase A capable of exiting the endoplasmic reticulum for transport to the lysosome. Therefore, pharmacological chaperones could provide a novel approach to the treatment of adult Tay-Sachs and possibly Sandhoff diseases.

The former two result from mutations in the evolutionarily related HEXA or HEXB genes, encoding the α or β subunits of heterodimeric β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A (Hex A, αβ), respectively (reviewed in Ref. 1Gravel R.A. Clarke J.T.R. Kaback M.M. Mahuran D. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. 2. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2839-2879Google Scholar). Two other homodimeric Hex isozymes exist, i.e. Hex B (ββ) and Hex S (αα). Each isozyme has its own characteristic pI and stability with Hex B being both the most stable and basic (pI = 6.9), followed by less stable Hex A (pI = 4.8), and unstable Hex S (pI ∼ 3). In normal human tissue only Hex A and B are readily detectable (1Gravel R.A. Clarke J.T.R. Kaback M.M. Mahuran D. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. 2. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2839-2879Google Scholar). Although each subunit contains an active site, dimerization is required for enzymatic activity (2Mark B.L. Mahuran D.J. Cherney M.M. Zhao D. Knapp S. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 1093-1109Google Scholar). However, in the lysosome only Hex A, along with its substrate-specific cofactor the GM2 activator protein, can hydrolyze the terminal, β-linked N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue from GM2 ganglioside. Whereas both the α- and/or β-active sites of dimeric Hex can hydrolyze synthetic N-acetylhexosamine terminal substrates, only the α-sites of Hex A and S can efficiently utilize negatively charged substrates, e.g. 6-sulfated GlcNAc (2Mark B.L. Mahuran D.J. Cherney M.M. Zhao D. Knapp S. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 1093-1109Google Scholar, 3Hou Y. Tse R. Mahuran D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3963-3969Google Scholar). Therefore, total Hex activity is measured using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-N-acetylglucosamine (MUG), whereas, 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate (MUGS) is used to measure Hex A and Hex S activity. At pH 4.2 the relative MUG/MUGS hydrolysis ratios of the three isozymes are: 150–300/1 for Hex B, 3–4/1 for Hex A, and 1–1.5/1 for Hex S (3Hou Y. Tse R. Mahuran D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3963-3969Google Scholar). The more common infantile TSD (ITSD) variant of GM2 gangliosidosis results from absent α subunits and elevated amounts of Hex B such that near normal levels of total Hex activity (MUG) are retained. Less common is acute, infantile SD (ISD), resulting from an absence of β-subunits. Interestingly, despite normal levels of α-mRNA, only 2–4% residual Hex activity, from Hex S, can be detected in ISD patient samples. In contrast to the infantile forms, adult TSD (ATSD) and SD (ASD) are chronic, slowly progressive, neurodegenerative diseases. In many cases these are associated with missense mutations, usually producing thermolabile Hex A with residual activity (MUGS) and protein levels that are <10% but >2% of normal. The majority of patients with ATSD possess a missense mutation in exon 7, αG269S (1Gravel R.A. Clarke J.T.R. Kaback M.M. Mahuran D. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. 2. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2839-2879Google Scholar). This and similar point mutations do not directly affect the active site of Hex (2Mark B.L. Mahuran D.J. Cherney M.M. Zhao D. Knapp S. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 1093-1109Google Scholar) but are believed to result in increased amounts of misfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which in turn are retained by its quality control system and degraded (4Mahuran D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1096: 87-94Google Scholar). Only a low level of residual Hex A activity is needed to ameliorate the clinical phenotype in ITSD or ISD, and asymptomatic individuals have been identified with residual activities of ≥10% of normal (5Dlott B. D'Azzo A. Quon D.V.K. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17921-17927Google Scholar, 6Cao Z. Petroulakis E. Salo T. Triggs-Raine B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14975-14982Google Scholar). Sandhoff and colleagues (7Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Dev. Neurosci. 1984; 6: 58-71Google Scholar) have estimated that 5–10% of normal Hex A levels represents a “critical threshold” for disease. Currently, there is no therapy for any form of GM2 gangliosidosis. Strategies involving bone marrow transplantation and enzyme replacement therapy are unlikely to be successful due to neuronal storage and the inaccessibility imposed by the blood-brain barrier. Substrate deprivation therapy, although feasible, is limited by specificity and toxicity issues. Pharmacological chaperones, small molecules that function either as antagonists (receptors) or competitive inhibitors (enzymes), have been used to “rescue” several misfolded proteins (reviewed in Refs. 8Fan J.Q. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 355-360Google Scholar and 9Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Google Scholar) from ER-associated degradation. They apparently act by increasing the stability of the newly synthesized, mutant protein, allowing more of it to exit the ER for transport to its site of action, e.g. lysosome. Because only a modest increase in residual Hex A activity is needed for ATSD and ASD patients to achieve the ∼10% critical threshold, these diseases are candidates for pharmacological chaperone-based therapy. In this report, we evaluate a panel of known Hex inhibitors (see Table I) as potential pharmacological chaperones. We show that the Hex inhibitors can increase levels of lysosomal Hex A activity to 35% of normal levels in fibroblasts from an αG269S homozygous ATSD patient. Additionally, the effects of these compounds on ASD, ISD, and ITSD fibroblasts were examined.Table IList of compounds evaluated for enhancing Hex A activity1 Value determined using human placental HEX.2 Value determined using Jack Bean Hex.

Reagents—The following fluorogenic substrates, all purchased from Sigma, methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucuronide (MUbGlr), 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (MUbGal), 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (MUP), MUG, and MUGS were used to assay the lysosomal enzymes β-glucuronidase, β-galactosidase, acid phosphatase, Hex A/B/S, and Hex A/S, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Human Hex A and β-glucosidase/glucocerebrosidase were prepared in our laboratory and have been previously described (10Brown C.A. Mahuran D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 497-508Google Scholar). Donkey polyclonal antibody developed against a C-terminal calnexin peptide was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Castanospermine, deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), 6-acetamido-6-deoxycastanospermine (ACAS) (IRL, New Zealand), 2-acetamido-1,2-dideoxynojirimycin (AddNJ) (TRC, Canada), GalNAc (Sigma) were commercially available; whereas 2-acetamido deoxynojirimycin (AdNJ) and N-acetylglucosamine thiazoline (NGT) were synthesized and purified according to Kappes and Legler (11Kappes E. Legler G. J. Carbohydr. Chem. 1989; 8: 371-388Google Scholar) and Knapp et al. (12Knapp S. Vocadlo D. Gao Z.N. Kirk B. Lou J.P. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 6804-6805Google Scholar), respectively. All compounds were dissolved in water and used as 10–25 mg/ml solutions. Steel wool #0000 (International Steel Wool, Mexico), FeCl2 and FeCl3 (Sigma), and dextran T4000 (Amersham Biosciences, UK) were used to prepare lysosomes by magnetic chromatography. Cell Lines—The following fibroblast cell lines were used: 4212 (from hereon referred to as wild type (WT) or unaffected) was from an unaffected individual; 1766 (ATSD) was from a ∼40-year-old female patient diagnosed with the chronic (adult) form of TSD (kindly provided by Dr. J. R. Donat, University of Saskatchewan, Kinsmen Children's Centre, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada) and found to be homozygous for the mutation 805G→A/805G→A (αG269S) in exon 7 of HEXA (Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Hospital For Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada); 2317 (ITSD) was from a female fetus with the acute (infantile) form of TSD homozygous for a 4-bp insertion mutation 1278insTATC in exon 11 of HEXA (Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory); 3577 (ASD), 3577 was from a ∼30-year-old female heterozygous for a βP504 S missense mutation and a 16-kb 5′ HEXB deletion mutation with an adult Sandhoff phenotype (13Rubin M. Karpati G. Wolfe L.S. Carpenter S. Klavins M.H. Mahuran D.J. J. Neurol. Sci. 1988; 87: 103-119Google Scholar, 14Hou Y. McInnes B. Hinek A. Karpati G. Mahuran D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21386-21392Google Scholar); and 294 (ISD) was from an infant female, homozygous for the 16-kb HEXB deletion mutation with infantile Sandhoff disease (15O'Dowd B. Klavins M.

All cell lines were grown in media containing α-MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) and antibiotics penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. Enzyme Kinetics—Cells were grown in 96-well tissue culture plates (Falcon). Trypsinized cells were diluted to give 50% confluence when plated, and equal numbers of cells were aliquoted into each well of the plate. Cells grown for longer than 5 days were supplemented with fresh media. Compounds were diluted in media, filter-sterilized (Millipore), and evaluated in triplicate, i.e. three different wells. Following 3–7 days of treatment, intracellular Hex A activities were determined. Media was removed, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed using 60 μl of 10 mm citrate/phosphate (CP; pH 4.2) buffer (CP buffer), containing 0.5% human serum albumin and 0.5% Triton X-100. Aliquots of the lysates were transferred to a 96-well plate, and Hex A activity was measured using 25 μl of 3.2 mm MUGS in CP buffer, with incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of 0.1 m 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, pH 10.5. Fluorescence was measured using an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and emission wavelength of 450 nm as previously described (14Hou Y. McInnes B. Hinek A. Karpati G. Mahuran D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21386-21392Google Scholar). For experiments in Figs. 2 and 5, 6, 7, the relative increase in MUGS activity was expressed as the average fluorescence reading from three wells of cells (n = 3) grown in the presence of compound, divided by the average fluorescence reading from three wells of cells (n = 3), grown for the same length of time, in the absence of any compound. For untreated cells, fluorescence readings for the individual wells varied by less than 20%. To measure total Hex activity and the activities of the other lysosomal enzymes, the substrates MUG (3.2 mm), MUP (3 mg/ml), MUbGal (0.56 mm) and MUbGlr (2.33 mm) were dissolved in CP buffer and used as described for MUGS.Fig. 5Kinetics of Hex A activity enhancement. a, MUGS activity in ATSD fibroblasts grown in the presence of three different concentrations of NGT over a 9-day period. Shown is the relative increase in MU fluorescence from MUGS hydrolysis (MU from treated/MU from untreated cells grown for the same length of time) in lysates from ATSD fibroblasts grown in different concentrations of NGT (corresponding symbols shown in the left-hand corner of the graph) for increasing periods of time (days). Each MUGS assay was further normalized using the acid phosphatase activity (MUP) of the same lysate. b, demonstrates that MUP hydrolysis is a valid means of normalization, because there were no changes in relative acid phosphatase activity (MUP) in another set of paired treated/untreated cell lysates over the same 9-day period. For each of the graphs, standard deviations are shown above the data points (average MU fluorescence from three wells of treated cells/three wells of untreated cells grown for the same period of time). Dashed lines denote the position at which there is no change in MU fluorescence, i.e. relative increase = 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6Hex A activity persists at elevated levels for several days following removal of the inhibitors from the growth media. All panels show the relative increase in MUGS hydrolysis (MU fluorescence, see legend to Fig. 5) by Hex in lysates from ATSD fibroblasts grown in different concentrations of NGT (corresponding symbols shown in the upper left corners) for increasing periods of time (days). Initially all fibroblasts were grown in the presence of NGT (a) or ACAS (b) for 6 days. Afterward fibroblasts continued to be grown in the presence of the drug (filled symbols) or in the absence of the drugs (open symbols) following removal of the original drug containing media on the sixth day. For each of the graphs, standard deviations are shown above the data points (average time-paired values from three wells each of treated/untreated cells).

Fibroblasts from an unaffected individual (a), and patients with; ITSD (b), ISD (c), ATSD (d), or ASD (e) were grown in the presence of 4 (a–d) or 3 (e) different concentrations (mm) of NGT for 5 (a–d) or 6 days (e). The relative changes in MU fluorescence due to MUG (filled diamonds) or MUGS (filled squares) hydrolysis are shown (left-most y-axis).

Also shown on the graphs is the MUG/MUGS ratio in treated cells (open triangles) and in untreated cells as a single open circle to the left of the other data points (the x-axis does not apply to these points), and the MUG/MUGS ratios for treated cell lysates are given on the right-most axis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For Western blot analysis and cellulose acetate electrophoresis (CAE), ATSD fibroblasts were grown for 5–6 days in 6-well plates (Falcon, 40 mm2) using 1.5 ml of medium with or without the compounds to be evaluated. Subsequently, media were removed, and cells were washed twice in PBS and finally scraped into 1 ml of PBS. Following pelleting by microcentrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.1, containing 5% glycerol and disrupted by sonication on ice. Cleared lysates were prepared by microcentrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C, and the total protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay (Pierce) according to manufacturer's instructions. Hex A activities were determined using MUGS substrate at 37 °C for 1 h as described above and expressed as nanomoles of 4-methylumbelliferone (MU) released/h/mg of total protein. Western Blotting—Lysates (5 μg of total protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% bis:acrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and processed as previously described (14Hou Y. McInnes B. Hinek A. Karpati G. Mahuran D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21386-21392Google Scholar). Blots were developed using chemiluminescent substrate according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences, UK) and recorded on BIOMAX x-ray film (Kodak). Blots were probed multiple times following stripping of bound antibody following treatment with RESTORE buffer (Pierce). Cellulose Acetate Electrophoresis—To separate and directly visualize the active Hex isozymes, Hex A (pI = 4.8, αβ), B (pI = 6.9, ββ), and S (pI∼ 3, αα), CAE was performed according to Ref. 17Hoeksema H.L. Reuser A.J. Hoogeveen A. Westerveld A. Braidman I. Robinson D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1977; 29: 14-23Google Scholar with modifications. Briefly, 2 μg of lysates protein was spotted onto Sepraphore (Gelman) strips (pre-wetted in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0), partially dried, and resolved electrophoretically at 10 mA for 20 min. Strips were overlaid with another cellulose acetate strip soaked in CP buffer containing 3.2 mm MUG, wrapped in plastic wrap, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, strips were briefly exposed to ammonium hydroxide vapor, and visualized bands were photographed under UV light (340 nm). Heat Inactivation Assay—Heat inactivation experiments were performed using partially purified Hex A from unaffected or ATSD fibroblasts. Lysates from fibroblasts were prepared in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.1, 5% glycerol after sonication. DEAE columns were pre-equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.1 (no salt). Lysates were applied, and the column was washed with 10 volumes of 20 mm sodium chloride in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.1, to elute Hex B. Hex A was eluted using the same buffer containing 100 mm sodium chloride. For heat inactivation experiments equal amounts of total protein (0.1–0.2 μg) from WT and mutant Hex A fractions were diluted in CP buffer, pH 4.2, containing 0.5% human serum albumin. Prior to incubation at 42 °C, diluted samples of the mutant Hex A enzyme lacking or containing Hex inhibitors were left on ice for 15 min. Following incubation of the WT and mutant Hex A enzymes at 42 °C for the requisite time, the heat-treated enzyme was then held on ice until completion of the time series. Time zero time points correspond to samples that were not heat-treated and kept on ice for the duration of the heat inactivation experiment. The heat-treated samples were equilibrated to 37 °C for 10 min, followed by addition of MUGS substrate and incubation at 37 °C for a further 30 min. Purification of Iron-dextran-labeled Lysosomes by Magnetic Chromatography—A lysosomal fraction was prepared from ATSD fibroblasts grown for 6 days in media lacking or containing 250 μg/ml (0.9 mm) of NGT, using a modification of a previously described procedure (18Diettrich O. Mills K. Johnson A.W. Hasilik A. Winchester B.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 369-372Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from one 150-mm tissue culture plate were incubated for 9 h at 37 °C in an iron-dextran solution (prepared as previously described (18Diettrich O. Mills K. Johnson A.W. Hasilik A. Winchester B.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 369-372Google Scholar)) containing complete α-MEM (with or without NGT). To chase the iron-dextran into lysosomes, cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated for a further 16 h in complete α-MEM media lacking or containing NGT. Subsequently, cells were trypsinized, pelleted at 100 × g, and then sequentially washed in PBS followed by homogenization buffer (HB), consisting of 4 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and 0.25 m sucrose. To prepare a postnuclear supernatant (PNS) fraction, the cell pellet was resuspended in HB, homogenized with 10 strokes of a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer and finally centrifuged for 10 min. at 1000 × g. For the steel wool column, a 1-ml syringe fitted with a 23-gauge needle was packed with 60 mg of steel wool and held in place by a rare earth magnet. Prior to use, the column was washed with HB, loaded with the PNS, and then the column was washed with 10 column volumes of HB. To elute the iron-dextran-loaded lysosomes bound to the steel wool, the column was removed from the magnet and loaded with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6, containing 5 mm EDTA and 0.4% Triton X-100. Fractions were collected, and those containing increased MUG activity (“lysosomes”) were identified and stored frozen at –80 °C. Competitive Inhibitors of Hex Attenuate Heat Inactivation of WT and ATSD Mutant Hex A—To assess the chaperoning potential of the inhibitors listed in Table I, the compounds were tested initially for their ability to attenuate heat inactivation of the ATSD mutant Hex A at 42 °C. Greater than 50% of the activity of partially purified Hex A from ATSD fibroblasts (Fig. 1a) was lost after 30 min, as compared with WT fibroblast Hex A whose activity was not significantly reduced. Attenuation of heat inactivation was observed when mutant Hex A was incubated at 42 °C in the presence of GalNAc (Fig. 1b), ACAS (Fig. 1c), and NGT (Fig. 1d) at concentrations that were previously determined to result in a 25–75% reduction in Hex A activity. The degree to which heat inactivation of mutant Hex A was attenuated was directly proportional to the concentration of the inhibitor included during treatment. With a longer period of heating, 60–90 min, similar protective effects of the three compounds were seen with purified placental Hex A (data not shown). ATSD Fibroblasts Treated with Hex Inhibitors Show Increased MUGS Activity—In fibroblasts from the ATSD patient, MUGS activity was found to be ∼10% of normal. When cells were grown for 5 days in the presence of GalNAc, AddNJ, AdNJ, ACAS, or NGT, increased hydrolysis of MUGS was observed (Fig. 2). This effect was dose-dependent, but was limited by the toxicity of GalNAc and ACAS, both of which reduced cell viability above concentrations of 200 and 0.1 mm, respectively. The decline in effectiveness with decreasing concentration of inhibitors was greatest for GalNAc and least for ACAS, which was still effective in enhancing MUGS activity even at concentrations of 5 μm. These results also demonstrated that Hex inhibitors, which attenuated heat inactivation of mutant enzyme, also enhanced Hex A activity in ATSD fibroblasts. Furthermore, because the effective concentration at which the inhibitors enhance MUGS activity correlates with their Ki values (Table I), the observed increases are most likely due to the specific binding of the compounds to the α-active site of Hex A. Two compounds, DNJ and castanospermine, which lacked the 2-acetamido group, did not increase MUGS hydrolysis and were used as negative controls. Treatment of ATSD Fibroblasts Results in Increased Levels of the Lysosomally Processed (Mature) α-Subunit and the Hex A Heterodimer—To directly show that treatment of ATSD fibroblasts with the inhibitory compounds results in increased amounts of the α-subunit in the lysosome, cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with an anti-Hex A antibody (Fig. 3a). In comparison to untreated cells, increased amounts of a 56-kDa band corresponding to lysosomally processed α-subunit (αm) were seen in cells treated with AddNJ, GalNAc, NGT, or ACAS. The corresponding band was also seen in WT fibroblasts, but not in ITSD fibroblast cells (which do not express the α-subunit). With the exception of cells treated with DNJ, the bands at 28 kDa, corresponding to lysosomally processed β-subunit of Hex (βm), remained largely unaffected by the treatments. As judged from densitometry, the increased levels of these bands (Fig. 3c) closely paralleled the increase in specific MUGS activity from lysates of inhibitor-treated ATSD cells. Of these, ATSD cells treated with 0.9 mm NGT showed the greatest increase in specific MUGS activity (∼3-fold) and levels of mature α-subunit. To rule out the unlikely possibility that the observed increased MUGS hydrolysis in treated cells was solely due to Hex S, the different Hex isozymes were resolved using cellulose acetate electrophoresis combined with MUG zymography (Fig. 3b). Increased amounts of a band that co-migrated with purified placental Hex A, were observed in inhibitor treated cell lysates, but could not be detected in untreated ATSD cells. Hex S (pI ∼ 3.5), which migrates faster than Hex A (pI = 4.8), could not be detected. The increase in α-subunits (Fig. 3a) and the Hex A isozyme (Fig. 3b) paralleled the increase in MUGS hydrolysis (Fig. 3c) indicating that the increased MUGS activity was a direct measure of increased Hex A in ATSD cells. Hex A Activity in NGT-treated ATSD Fibroblasts Is Enriched in Lysosomes—To demonstrate directly that the increased Hex A (MUGS) activity is found in lysosomes, an ER-free lysosomal enriched fraction was prepared by magnetic chromatography of the crude lysates from untreated and NGT-treated ATSD fibroblasts loaded with iron-dextran colloid (18Diettrich O. Mills K. Johnson A.W. Hasilik A. Winchester B.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 369-372Google Scholar, 19Glombitza G.J. Becker E. Kaiser H.W. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5199-5207Google Scholar). An ∼10-fold enrichment in Hex A-specific activity was observed in the lysosomal fraction relative to the postnuclear supernatant (Fig. 4a). NGT treatment resulted in a greater than 6-fold increase in intracellular, lysosomal Hex A-specific activity relative to untreated cells. A similar increase in mature α-subunit protein levels was seen in the PNS and lysosomal fractions of NGT-treated cells (Fig. 4b). Although a Hex α-subunit-specific band is observed in the PNS from untreated cells, it corresponds to the α-chain precursor, because it is not found in the lysosomal fraction (Fig. 4b). Both glucocerebrosidase (another lysosomal enzyme) and the β-subunit of Hex are enriched in the lysosomal fraction relative to PNS, confirming the enrichment of lysosomal organelles in the “lysosome” fraction from both treated and untreated cells. Furthermore, these lysosomal-enriched fractions did not"
https://openalex.org/W2094883350,"Survivin is a novel anti-apoptotic protein that is highly expressed in cancer but is undetectable in most normal adult tissues. It was reported that taxol-mediated mitotic arrest of cancer cells is associated with survivin induction, which preserves a survival pathway and results in resistance to taxol. In this study, we provide new evidence that induction of survivin by taxol is an early event and is independent of taxol-mediated G2/M arrest. Taxol treatment of MCF-7 cells rapidly up-regulated survivin expression (3.5–15-fold) within 4 h without G2/M arrest. Lengthening the treatment of cells (48 h) with taxol resulted in decreased survivin expression in comparison with early times following taxol treatment, although G2/M cells were significantly increased at later times. Interestingly, 3 nm taxol induces survivin as effectively as 300 nm and more effectively than 3000 nm. As a result, 3 nm taxol is ineffective at inducing cell death. However, inhibition of taxol-mediated survivin induction by small interfering RNA significantly increased taxol-mediated cell death. Taxol rapidly activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and MAPK pathways. Inhibition of these pathways diminished survivin induction and sensitized cells to taxol-mediated cell death. A cis-acting DNA element upstream of -1430 in the survivin pLuc-2840 construct is at least partially responsible for taxol-mediated survivin induction. Together, these data show, for the first time, that taxol-mediated induction of survivin is an early event and independent of taxol-mediated G2/M arrest. This appears to be a new mechanism for cancer cells to evade taxol-induced apoptosis. Targeting this survival pathway may result in novel approaches for cancer therapeutics.

It is undetectable in most normal adult tissues but highly expressed in cancer. Survivin expression has been shown to be associated with carcinogenesis, cancer progression, poor prognosis, drug resistance, and short patient survival (1Li F. J. Cell.

Taxol (paclitaxel) is one of the most active cancer chemotherapeutic agents. It is effective against a variety of human tumors including ovarian, breast, and non-small-cell lung tumors as well as head and neck carcinomas (9McGuire W.P. Rowinsky E.K. Rosenshein N.B.

Drugs Aging. 1998; 12: 305-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, its effectiveness is often limited because many tumors display taxol resistance. Cancer cells can acquire resistance to taxol by at least two different mechanisms (14Casazza A.M. Fairchild C.R. Cancer Treat. Res. 1996; 87: 149-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the multidrug resistance 1(MDR1) gene, which encodes P-glycoprotein, can confer resistance to taxol. This is because P-glycoprotein functions as a xenobiotic pump that pumps taxol as well as many other chemotherapeutic agents out of cells (15Bhalla K. Huang Y. Tang C. Self S. Ray S. Mahoney M.E. Ponnathpur V. Tourkina E. Ibrado A.M. Bullock G. Willingham M.C. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 465-475PubMed Google Scholar). The other is that tubulin mutations, which result in alterations in either the assembly or stability of microtubules, can lead to taxol resistance (16Schibler M.J. Cabral F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1522-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Giannakakou P. Sackett D.L. Kang Y.K. Zhan Z. Buters J.T. Fojo T. Poruchynsky M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17118-17125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). However, taxol resistance resulting from apoptotic blockade has not been well studied. Taxol treatment induces mitotic arrest through taxol-induced polymerization and stabilization of microtubules (18Kumar N. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10435-10441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schiff P.B. Fant J. Horwitz S.B. Nature. 1979; 277: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (3149) Google Scholar, 20Schiff P.B.

Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 688-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and it induces cell death by apoptosis or necrosis dependent of drug concentration (23Woods C.M. Zhu J. McQueney P.A. Bollag D. Lazarides E. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 506-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ireland C.M. Pittman S.M. Biochem.

Sheikh M.S. Fojo T. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2002; 1: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that survivin expression is cell cycle-regulated with a robust increase in the G2/M phase of cell cycle (2Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 27Li F. Altieri D.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3143-3151PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, cells treated with taxol should show an increased survivin expression because of G2/M arrest. Consistent with this notion, it was reported that taxol-induced microtubule stabilization and mitotic arrest increase survivin expression, which engenders a cell survival pathway to counteract taxol-induced apoptosis (28O'Connor D.S. Wall N.R. Porter A.C. Altieri D.C. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether this mitotic survival pathway is the only means involving survivin by which cancer cells counteract taxol-induced apoptosis following drug treatment. Here, we report that induction of survivin by taxol is an early event and is independent of taxol-mediated G2/M arrest. We found that taxol treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells rapidly up-regulated survivin expression without apparent arrest of cells into G2/M phase. Lengthening the treatment of cells (48 h) with taxol resulted in decreased survivin expression in comparison with early times following taxol treatment, although the percentage of cells in G2/M phase was significantly increased at later times. Consistent with the observation that 3 nm taxol induced survivin as effectively as 300 nm and more effectively than 3000 nm taxol, 3 nm taxol are ineffective for apoptotic induction in these cells. However, inhibition of taxol-mediated induction of survivin by small interfering/inhibitory RNA (siRNA) significantly increased taxol-mediated cell death. Mechanistic studies indicated that taxol rapidly activated the PI3K/Akt and Erk MAPK pathways, and inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling by Ly294002 or Erk MAPK signaling by U0126/PD98059 diminished survivin induction by taxol and sensitized cells to taxol-induced cell death. Survivin promoter-luciferase reporter assays revealed that early taxol-mediated induction of survivin is at least in part transcriptionally regulated and that the cis-acting DNA element mediating the effects of taxol on survivin promoter activity is located upstream of -1430 in the pLuc-2840 construct. Together, these data show for the first time that induction of survivin by taxol is an early event following drug exposure and is independent of taxol-mediated G2/M arrest. This appears to be a new mechanism by which cancer cells evade taxol-induced apoptosis. Targeting this novel survival pathway may have potential in cancer therapeutic applications. Cell Culture—MCF-7 cells, a breast cancer cell line without P-glycoprotein and multidrug-resistant protein-1 expression, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (MediaTech CellGro, Herndon, VA), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were routinely subcultured twice weekly. Reagents—Taxol, anti-β-actin, goat peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Sigma. Anti-survivin (FL-142), anti-Erk (K-23), and anti-Akt (H-136) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-Akt (Ser-473) and phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). LY294002, PD98059, U0126, and dual luciferase report assay system were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Oligotransfectamine reagent was purchased from Invitrogen. FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was bought from Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, IN). Treatment—Taxol stock solutions were 4 mm in Me2SO and stored at -20 °C. Just prior to taxol treatment, the stock solution was freshly diluted with Me2SO (3, 30, 300, and 3000 μm) and then further diluted in RPMI 1640 medium to final concentrations of 3, 30, 300, and 3000 nm, respectively. In the concentration-dependent experiments, MCF-7 cells were treated with 3, 30, 300, and 3000 nm taxol for 8 h. In the time-dependent experiments, MCF-7 cells were treated with 30 nm taxol and harvested at 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h after taxol treatment. In the subcellular localization experiments, MCF-7 cells were treated with 3 nm taxol. For all of the experiments, the control group was treated with the same amount Me2SO. In experiments for exploration of signaling pathways and cell death, MCF-7 cells were treated with and without taxol (3 and 30 nm) in the presence and absence of various concentrations of PI3K (LY294002) or MEK (PD98059 and U0126) inhibitors. Survivin expression was analyzed by Western blot described below after treatment for 8 h. Cell morphological changes were microscopically photographed after treatment for 48 h. Western Blot—Cells with and without treatment were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm KCl) and lysed on ice for 30 min in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μm leupeptin. After the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the total protein was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay solution. Up to 75 μg of total protein was denatured in 2× SDS sample loading buffer for 5 min at 95 °C, separated on 10–15% SDS-PAGE gels, and electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using semidry electrophoretic transfer. After the nonspecific binding sites on the membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk or bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.137 m NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20) for 3 h at room temperature with constant shaking, the membranes were incubated in TBS-T containing the relevant primary antibody (1:500–1000) and 5% BSA overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBS-T for three times, the membrane was incubated in 5% skimmed milk in TBS-T buffer containing the appropriate second anti-IgG antibody (1:5000) at room temperature for 1 h with constant shaking. The phosphorylation or expression of the target protein was detected by the ECL protein detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions and visualized by autoradiography with the Kodak X-Omat AR film. For normalization of protein loading, the same membranes were stripped with stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) and used for Western blot by the same procedure with a monoclonal antibody against β-actin (1:1000 dilution) and/or with the polyclonal antibodies against the relevant total protein. Trypan Blue Exclusion Staining for Determination of Cell Viability— Cells to be counted were collected by trypsinization/centrifugation and resuspended in PBS buffer. A small sample of the cell suspension was diluted in 0.4% (w/v) trypan blue (one sample at a time because viable cells absorb trypan blue over time as well). A cover glass was centered over the hemacytometer chambers, and one chamber was filled with the cell dilution using a Pasteur pipette. Stained (dead) and unstained (viable) cells were counted in each of the four corner and central squares under an inverted microscope using ×100 magnification, respectively. Each cell sample was counted in this way for three times. The percentage of cell viabilities in each sample was calculated with the formula of % viability = total viable cell numbers/total cell numbers × 100. Propidium Iodide Staining and Flow Cytometry—At various time intervals after taxol treatment (30 nm) as described above, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed with PBS. Cells (∼1 × 106) were resuspended in 5 ml of 70% ethanol. After the initial fixation, cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 25 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 40 μg/ml RNase A and incubated for at least 30 min at 4 °C. The cells then were analyzed for immunofluorescence intensities by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences) from 10,000 events/sample. Data from flow cytometry were analyzed using WinList software (Verity Software House Inc., Topsham, ME). For each time point, triplicate assays were performed. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were seeded on the round glass coverslips coated with 2% gelatin (Sigma) in 12-well plates. At different intervals after 3 nm taxol treatment as described above, medium was removed and cells were washed once with PBS and fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C. Cells were then permeabilized and blocked for 30 min in PBS containing 2% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100. For survivin and nuclear DNA double staining, the blocked cells were first incubated in PBS containing 1% BSA and rabbit anti-survivin antibody (1:500) for 60 min at 37 °C followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) for 30 min at 37 °C. The nuclear DNA was then stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml in H2O for 10 min at room temperature. The resultant glass coverslips containing cells were mounted on glass slides with Gel/Mount™ solution (Biomedia Corp., Foster City, CA). The cells were analyzed under a Zeiss Axiovert 100M digital fluorescence microscope. Images were captured using Zeiss LSM510, version 2.8 and processed with Photoshop Element software. SiRNA Preparation—A human survivin mRNA-specific RNA oligonucleotides with 3′-TT overhangs were chemically synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (Xeragon, Huntsville, AL) as follows: SRi-2F (92GCG CCU GCA CCC CGG AGC G110TT*) and SRi-2R (110CGC UCC GGG GUG CAG GCG C92TT). Equal moles of SRi-2F/SRi-2R (designated SRi-2) were mixed together to a final concentration of 20 μm in annealing buffer (100 mm KAc, 30 mm HEPES-KOH, and 2 mm MgAc2, pH 7.4). After denaturation at 90 °C for 1 min, the mixture (Sri-2) was annealed at 37 °C for 60 min and stored at -80 °C for transfection experiments. A scramble RNA duplex (designated scraSRi) was also prepared same as above for a negative control in this study. The scramble sequence (5′-CAG UCG CGU UUG CGA CUG GTT-3′ (forward chain) and 5′-CCA GUC GCA AAC GCG ACU GTT-3′ (reverse chain)) was not present in mammalian cells by BLAST search at NCBI. In Vitro Transfection with siRNAs—Cells were transfected with survivin siRNAs using the Oligofectamine reagent following the manufacturer's instruction. 1 day prior to transfection, 5 × 104 MCF-7 cells/well were seeded in six-well plates (corresponding to a density of 40% at the time of transfection) without antibiotics. The transfection mixture was prepared by mixing 175 μl of DMEM containing 6 μl of 20 μm siRNA with 15 μl of DMEM containing 3 μl of Oligofectamine reagents. Before transfection, the medium in 6-well plates was replaced with serum-free DMEM medium (800 μl/well). The transfection mixture was added to the 6-well plate within 20–40 min after mixture preparation in a total volume of 990 μl/well. The transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, and then 500 μl of DMEM medium containing 30% fetal bovine serum was added. Cells were treated with and without 3 and 30 nm taxol 24 h after transfection with siRNA or control siRNA as described above. For Western blot, cells were harvested 8 h after taxol treatment. For flow cytometry analysis of sub-G1 DNA content, cells were harvested 24 and 48 h after taxol treatment and analyzed by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry as described above. The percentage of dead cells (sub-G1 DNA contents) was plotted as a histogram. All of the transfection experiments were performed at triplicate for each experiment. Luciferase Reporter Assay—MCF-7 cells were transfected with survivin promoter-luciferase constructs pLuc-6270, which contains a 6.3-kb survivin promoter sequence (29Li F. Altieri D.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics), and luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the respective manufacturers' recommendations. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates 1 day prior to transfection. On the following day, the transfection solution for each well was prepared by sequentially adding 1 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent and 0.4 μg of plasmid DNA in a 1.5-ml tube containing 50 μl of serum-free DMEM medium. The DNA FuGENE 6 mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20–30 min and then added onto cells at ∼50% confluence in each well containing complete medium. The transfected cells were treated with 3 and/or 30 nm taxol 24 h after transfection for the 30-h time point, and then taxol (3 and/or 30 nm in final concentration) was added to the transfected cells at other time points at 4 (26-h time point), 8 (22-h time point), and 22 h (8-h time point) after the first taxol treatment to permit the simultaneous harvesting of the cells from all of the time points. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 200 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega) per well 8 h after the last taxol treatment. After incubation of the plate on ice for 45 min, the lysate was transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube by scraping with a rubber policeman. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 20 μl of cell lysates/well was used to measure Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity using a luminometer by adding 20 μl of luciferase assay reagent. Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activities as arbitrary units and plotted as a histogram from a representative experiment in triplicate. Induction of Survivin by Taxol Is an Early Event and Is Independent of taxol-mediated G2/M Arrest—It was previously shown that taxol (2–200 nm) treatment of HeLa cells for 48 h increases survivin expression to 1.2–4-fold in taxol-mediated G2/M arrest (28O'Connor D.S. Wall N.R. Porter A.C. Altieri D.C. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To closely investigate the relationship between taxol-mediated G2/M arrest and survivin induction, MCF-7 cells were treated with taxol at various concentrations and times as shown (Fig. 1A) and survivin expression was analyzed by Western blot. To our surprise, lengthening taxol treatments (48 h or more) significantly attenuated survivin induction in comparison with the early times (24 h, Fig. 1A). The high induction of survivin at 24 h suggested that induction of survivin expression might occur at even earlier times. Consistent with this notion, Western blot experiments to test early time points after taxol treatment indicated that taxol-mediated survivin induction is as early as 4 h and that extending treatment times beyond 24 h diminished the effect of taxol on survivin induction in comparison with earlier time points (Fig. 1B). This result strongly suggested that induction of survivin by taxol is probably independent of taxol-mediated G2/M arrest. To confirm this possibility, we determined cell cycle distribution by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry after taxol treatment. As shown (Fig. 2A), there is no apparent G2/M cell population increase at the 4 and 8-h times of taxol treatment in comparison with the no taxol control. A significant increase of G2/M cell population was observed only after taxol treatment for 16 h or more (Fig. 2A). We next examined individual cells by survivin immunofluorescence microscopy after taxol treatment for 4 h. The results indicated that interphase cells showed increased immunoreactivity with anti-survivin antibody in comparison to no taxol treatment control. A representative experiment from the immunofluorescence microscopy study is shown in Fig. 2B. The G2/M phase-independent induction of survivin expression by taxol was further confirmed by monitoring the expression of cyclin B1 (a G2/M phase marker) after taxol treatment. There was no change in cyclin B1 expression 4 h after taxol treatment (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the cyclin B1 protein was almost undetectable 48 h after taxol treatment (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the cells were synchronized in later anaphase.Fig. 2Effects of taxol on cell cycle distribution and the expression of survivin and cyclin B1 in MCF-7 cells. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, cell cycle distribution was determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry after taxol treatment at various time points and shown as a histogram. Each bar represents the mean ± S.D. from a representative experiment in triplicate. Cell viability determined by trypan blue exclusion in each time point is shown in Fig. 1B. B, rapid induction of survivin expression by taxol was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown, survivin expression in non-mitotic cells was significantly increased 4 h after taxol treatment in comparison with no taxol treatment control. C, time course of induction of cyclin B1 expression after taxol treatment. The relative-fold increase of cyclin B1 protein after normalization to β-actin internal control is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Low Concentrations (3–30 nm) of Taxol Effectively Induced Survivin Expression but Were Ineffective for Apoptosis Induction—Unexpectedly, the induction of survivin expression by taxol at low concentrations (3 nm) was as effective as or more effective than high concentrations (3000 nm) (Fig. 3A). Consistent with the observation that high expression of survivin increases cell viability and engenders drug resistance (28O'Connor D.S. Wall N.R. Porter A.C. Altieri D.C. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 30Zaffaroni N. Pennati M. Colella G. Perego P. Supino R. Gatti L. Pilotti S. Zunino F. Daidone M.G.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 230-235PubMed Google Scholar), low concentrations (3–30 nm) of taxol were ineffective for induction of cell death in comparison with high concentrations of the drug (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of Taxol-mediated Induction of Survivin Expression by siRNA-sensitized Taxol-induced Cell Death—We employed a survivin siRNA approach (32Ling X. Li F. BioTechniques. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) for inhibition of taxol-mediated survivin induction to determine the effect of survivin inhibition on taxol-induced cell death. Fig. 4A shows the structures of siRNAs used in this study. Consistent with the result that survivin siRNA significantly inhibited the taxol-mediated induction of survivin in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4B), propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis indicated that a combination of siRNA-targeting survivin and a low concentration of taxol treatment strikingly increased cell death (the sub-G1 DNA content increase) in comparison with either treatment alone (Fig. 4C). This observation suggests that survivin expression plays a critical role in cell viability and that induction of survivin by taxol is a potential drug resistance factor leading to cell survival. Taxol Treatment Rapidly Enhanced Akt and Erk1/2 Phosphorylation in MCF-7 Cells—It has been shown that activation of the Akt survival pathway can up-regulate survivin expression (33Papapetropoulos A.

To delineate the underlying mechanism by which taxol rapidly induced survivin expression, the activation of Akt and Erk1/2 after taxol treatment was examined in MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of both Akt and Erk1/2 were rapidly and strongly increased after taxol treatment of these cells (Fig. 5).

https://openalex.org/W1998284663,"The hepatitis B virus-X protein (HBx) regulates fundamental aspects of mitochondrial physiology. We show that HBx down-regulates mitochondrial enzymes involved in electron transport in oxidative phosphorylation (complexes I, III, IV, and V) and sensitizes the mitochondrial membrane potential in a hepatoma cell line. HBx also increases the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxide production. HBx does not activate apoptotic signaling, although it sensitizes hepatoma cells to apoptotic signaling, which is dependent on reactive oxygen species. Increased intrahepatic lipid peroxidation in HBx transgenic mice demonstrated that oxidative injury occurs as a direct result of HBx expression. Therefore, we conclude that mitochondrial dysfunction is a crucial pathophysiological factor in HBx-expressing hepatoma cells and provides an experimental rationale in the investigation of mitochondrial function in rapidly renewed tissues, as in hepatocellular carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2016788802,"A synthetic gene encoding the fusion protein (Ala-Hyp)51-enhanced green fluorescent protein expressed in Nicotiana tabacum cells produced a fusion glycoprotein with all proline residues hydroxylated and substituted with an arabinogalactan polysaccharide.

We isolated a 15-residue Hyp-arabinogalactan for structure determination by sugar analyses and one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance techniques that provided the assignment of proton and carbon signals of a small polysaccharide O-linked to the hydroxyl group of Hyp. The polysaccharide consisted of a 1,3-linked β-d-Galp backbone with a single 1,6-linked β-d-Galp “kink.” The backbone had two side chains of Galp substituted at position 3 with an arabinose di- or trisaccharide and at position 6 with glucuronic acid or rhamnosyl glucuronic acid.

Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) 1The abbreviations used are: AGPs, arabinogalactan proteins; Hyp, hydroxyproline; HRGPs, hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins; GlcUA, glucuronic acid; Rha, rhamnose; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; ROESY, rotating frame nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; PPII, polyproline II. expressed at the plant cell surface comprise a multigene family of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) broadly implicated in all aspects of plant growth and development from fertilization to apoptosis (1Gaspar Y.M.

Cytol. 1997; 174: 195-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with other HRGPs like the extensins that contain highly repetitive motifs based on contiguous Hyp residues, AGPs show a lower peptide periodicity based on clustered non-contiguous Hyp residues. Although short O-linked arabinoside substituents decorate contiguous Hyp residues of both extensins and AGPs, the larger arabinogalactans attached to clustered non-contiguous Hyp define the hyperglycosylated AGPs (90-95% carbohydrate) (3Kieliszewski M.J.

Kieliszewski M.J. Plant J. 2002; 31: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These differences in glycosylation reflect different networks, cellular locations, and biological functions. Thus cross-linked extensins form covalent networks in muro, whereas noncovalently associated AGPs (5Du H. Clarke A.E. Bacic A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 411-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 6Gens J.S. Fujiki M. Pickard B.G. Protoplasma. 2000; 212: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) occur primarily at the periplasmic interface where a glycosylphosphatidylinositol lipid initially anchors them to the plasma membrane (7Youl J.J.

The precise role of AGPs, both soluble and anchored, remains unclear. However, AGPs readily associate (5Du H. Clarke A.E. Bacic A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 411-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Gane A.M. Craik D. Munro S.L.A. Howlett G.J. Clarke A.E. Bacic A. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 277: 67-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); furthermore, β-glycosyl Yariv compounds interact specifically with AGPs and also inhibit cell expansion (12Roy S. Jauh G.Y. Hepler P.K. Lord E.M. Planta. 1998; 204: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13Serpe M.D. Nothnagel E.A. Planta. 1994; 193: 542-550Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These observations imply that multiple weak interactions between the polysaccharide components are essential to the role of AGPs (8Svetek J. Yadav M.P. Nothnagel E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14724-14733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 9Sherrier D.J. Prime T.A. Dupree P.

The arabinogalactan substituents occur in small clusters along the polypeptide backbone forming glycomodules that are highly conserved (14Shpak E. Barbar E. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11272-11278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Shpak E. Leykam J. Kieliszewksi M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Phytochemistry. 2001; 57: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and hence of functional significance, no doubt involving specific interactions. Thus, it is of paramount interest to elucidate the size, structure, arrangement, shape, and binding partners of these glycomodules in more detail. AGP arabinogalactan polysaccharides typically consist of short side chains containing arabinose and often rhamnose (Rha) and glucuronic acid (GlcUA) attached to a β-(1→3)-linked galactan backbone core (11Gane A.M. Craik D. Munro S.L.A. Howlett G.J. Clarke A.E. Bacic A. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 277: 67-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Based on 13C NMR spectra of crude gum arabic degradation products, Defaye and Wong (17Defaye J. Wong E. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 150: 221-231Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar) deduced a complete linkage analysis of a short pentameric side chain containing Ara, galactose (Gal), Rha, and GlcUA, and they proposed that the side chain is a major component of gum arabic arabinogalactan polysaccharide. Likewise, Akiyama and Kato (18Akiyama Y. Kato K. Phytochemistry. 1981; 20: 2507-2510Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) suggested a similar structure occurred in the AGPs of Nicotiana tabacum suspension-cultured cells. More recently, Gane applied one-dimensional and two-dimensional homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR techniques to characterize a mixture of AGPs from Nicotiana alata and described a structure having a highly branched backbone of 3-, 6-, and 3,6-linked Galp with terminal Galp and Araf side chains (11Gane A.M. Craik D. Munro S.L.A. Howlett G.J. Clarke A.E. Bacic A. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 277: 67-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, complete structural elucidation of an entire AGP polysaccharide remained a formidable problem. Recently, we introduced the use of synthetic genes to express single repetitive glycopeptide motifs of AGPs and extensins which effectively amplifies glycomodules of interest and simplifies their isolation (14Shpak E. Barbar E. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11272-11278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Shpak E. Leykam J. Kieliszewksi M.J. Proc. Natl.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1362-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). AGPs often have short Ala-Hyp repeats. Synthetic gene constructs of these repeats gave an (Ala-Hyp)51 expression product with all the Hyp residues glycosylated by an arabinogalactan polysaccharide (19Tan L. Leykam J. Kieliszewski M.J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1362-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This novel AGP was therefore suitable for isolating Hyp-arabinogalactan polysaccharides, first described in sycamore-maple (20Pope D.G. Plant Physiol. 1977; 59: 894-900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and tomato cells (21Lamport D.T.A. Loewus F.A. Runeckles V.C. Recent Advances in Phytochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1977: 79-115Google Scholar). Here we report the first complete structural analysis of an arabinogalactan polysaccharide, including a space-filling model that depicts possible glycan interactions. Isolation of the (Ala-Hyp)51-EGFP Fusion Protein and (Ala-Hyp)51—The (Ala-Hyp)51-EGFP fusion glycoprotein was isolated from spent medium of 20-day transformed N. tabacum BY-2 suspension cultured cells by a combination of hydrophobic interaction and reversed phase chromatography, as described earlier (19Tan L. Leykam J. Kieliszewski M.J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1362-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). (Ala-Hyp)51 was isolated from tryptic digests of (Ala-Hyp)51-EGFP by gel permeation chromatography, also described earlier (19Tan L. Leykam J. Kieliszewski M.J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1362-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) Deglycosylation—We deglycosylated 3-5 mg of (Ala-Hyp)51 with HF for 1 h at 4 °C as described earlier (3Kieliszewski M.J. O'Neill M. Leykam J. Orlando R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2541-2549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Base Hydrolysis of (Ala-Hyp)51-EGFP—Sixty-six milligrams of (Ala-Hyp)51-EGFP was dissolved in 9 ml of 0.44 n NaOH and hydrolyzed at 105 °C for 18 h. The hydrolysate was chilled on ice and neutralized with 1 n HCl to pH 7.6, followed by freeze-drying. Hyp-Arabinogalactan Glycoamino Acid Purification—The neutralized, dry base hydrolysate of (Ala-Hyp)51-EGFP was dissolved in deionized, distilled H2O and applied to a 75 × 0.6-cm column (H+ form) of Technicon Chromobeads C washed and eluted with deionized, distilled H2O. The water eluate contained the Hyp-polysaccharides that were pooled and freeze-dried before further purification on an analytical Superdex-peptide gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). The Superdex-peptide column was equilibrated and isocratically eluted in 20% acetonitrile (aqueous) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. One hundred microliters of each fraction (fraction size was 0.9 ml) were assayed for Hyp as described earlier (20Pope D.G. Plant Physiol. 1977; 59: 894-900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Superdex fractions representing the median arabinogalactan size were combined and refractionated on the Superdex-peptide column using the same conditions described above, except the fraction volumes were smaller (450 μl/1.5 min). Fractions containing the Hyp-glycoamino acids were individually freeze-dried. We chose the fraction with the most material, designated AHP-1, for further analyses. Sugar Composition and Linkage Analyses—The monosaccharide composition of AHP-1 was analyzed as alditol acetate derivatives by gas chromatography (22Albersheim P. Nevins D.J. English P.D. Karr A. Carbohydr. Res. 1967; 5: 340-345Crossref Scopus (1517) Google Scholar) or by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the per-O-trimethylsilyl derivatives (23Merkle R.K. Poppe I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 24York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Uronic acids were also estimated colorimetrically (25Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar). For linkage analysis, samples were permethylated, depolymerized, reduced, and acetylated resulting in partially methylated alditol acetates that were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as described earlier (24York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Glycan Size Estimation—The glycan size was determined by dividing the moles of monosaccharide in a known weight of AHP-1 or (Ala-Hyp)51-EGFP by the moles of Hyp present. Hyp amount was determined colorimetrically (20Pope D.G. Plant Physiol. 1977; 59: 894-900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the monosaccharide content by gas chromatography as described above. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra of standard poly-l-hydroxyproline (5-20 kDa, Sigma) and purified (Ala-Hyp)51 and deglycosylated (Ala-Hyp)51 were recorded on a Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD). Spectra were averaged over two scans with a bandwidth of 1 nm and step resolution of 0.5 nm. All spectra were reported in terms of mean residue ellipticity with the 190-250-nm region using a 1-mm path length. Samples were dissolved in water at a concentration of 18 μm. NMR Experiments—All one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments were carried out on AHP-1 (∼2.5 mg AHP-1/ml D2O) with Varian Unity INOVA 600-MHz spectrometer operating at 1H and 13C frequencies of 598.621 and 150.536 MHz, respectively. Analyses were conducted at 60 °C, as at this temperature the residual H2O signal overlapped with the fewest resonances and the line widths had narrowed. The only exception was a NOESY experiment that was carried out at 30 °C to slow down molecular motion and increase the number of cross-peaks. Quadrature detection in the indirect dimension was achieved by the hypercomplex method (26States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar) for both homonuclear and heteronuclear experiments. HMQC experiments were typically conducted with spectral width of 8 kHz for 1H and 30 kHz for 13C, respectively, a 1JCH set to 150 Hz, a relaxation delay of 1.5 s, the delay for minimizing signals from 1H bound to 12C set to 0.30 s, and WURST decoupling (27Kupce E. Freeman R.J. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1995; 115: 273-276Crossref Scopus (549) Google Scholar) on the 13C channel. Data were collected as an array of 2 × 128K point, which after linear prediction in t1 dimension and zero filling in both dimensions produced a 2 × 1K data matrix. For HMBC experiments, the acquisition conditions were similar to those used for HMQC spectra but with no decoupling in the 13C channel. Data set consisting of 4 × 1K data points was acquired with multibounds JCH set to 8 Hz. DQCOSY spectra were collected with spectral width of 8 kHz in both dimensions. A relaxation delay of 2 s was used. The TOCSY mixing time was 90 ms. The NOESY spectra were recorded with mixing time of 250 ms. Data were processed by using NMRPipe (28Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G. Zhu G. Pferfer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed by using nmrview (29Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling Software—We used HyperChem version 7.0 running on a fast dual-processor Pentium machine (plus 1Gb RAM) to build and energy-minimize the (Ala-Pro)6 glycosylated and non-glycosylated peptide via the Mm+ force field and steepest descent algorithm. The HyperChem Sugar Builder module allowed the facile construction of small oligosaccharides that were then energy-minimized and ligated to form the small polysaccharide AHP-1 followed by final energy-minimization again using the Amber3 force field. (We corrected a software error in the anomeric configuration of l-sugars by inserting the α- for β-anomer and vice versa in order to follow IUPAC definitions.) Three AHP-1 polysaccharides were then attached glycosidically to (Ala-Pro)6 to form a tight cluster of three consecutive arabinogalactans on non-contiguous Hyp residues and then subjected to final energy minimization using the Amber3 force field. We found it helpful to define the approximate bond lengths for the Gal-Hyp glycosidic link by using the “set bond length” command when attaching the polysaccharide to the polypeptide. Earlier work showed that (Ala-Hyp)51-EGFP, isolated as described earlier (19Tan L. Leykam J. Kieliszewski M.J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1362-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), contained 51 O-Hyp-linked arabinogalactan polysaccharides containing Gal, Ara, GlcUA, and Rha. Base hydrolysis of (Ala-Hyp)51-EGFP released Hyp-arabinogalactans that voided a Chromobeads cation exchange column (Fig. 1A). Further fractionation on a Superdex-peptide gel filtration column yielded a major peak containing small Hyp-arabinogalactan polysaccharides ranging in size from about 13-26 monosaccharide residues judging by the molar ratio of monosaccharide to Hyp in each fraction (Fig. 1B). Fractions 11 and 12 from the column contained the most material (2.8 mg), judging by the recovered weights, and therefore were chosen for refractionation on the Superdex column. Refractionation of 11 and 12 produced a single major peak (Fig. 1C) the tip of which we collected for structural analyses. The peak was designated Ala-Hyp polysaccharide-1 (AHP-1). Monosaccharide analyses of isolated AHP-1 indicated it was rich in Gal and Ara (50 and 33 mol %, respectively) with lesser amounts of Rha and GlcUA (4 and 14 mol %, respectively), yielding the following molar ratios: 7 Gal:5 Ara:2 GlcUA:0.5 Rha. This was consistent with the estimated size and composition of the isolated oligosaccharide and with the NMR data below, albeit with an underestimate of Rha. The isolated AHP-1 glycan size was also consistent with that deduced from the sugar composition of intact (Ala-Hyp)51-EGFP, which also showed a ratio of 15.1 sugar residues per Hyp. This indicates that Hyp-polysaccharides were released, but not degraded, by alkaline hydrolysis. Consistent with the sugar composition, the linkage analysis of AHP-1 (Table I) showed mainly 3,6-linked Galp with lesser amounts of terminal, 3- and 6-linked Galp; Ara occurred as terminal Araf, 3- and 5-linked Araf, all Rha was terminal, and the GlcUA residues were either terminal or 4-linked. However, the linkage analyses (repeated three times) were not strictly quantitative due to incomplete methylation and perhaps partial loss of volatile methylated pentose.Table IGlycosyl linkage analysis of AHP-1Deduced glycosidic linkageMolEstimated molar amountsaEstimated assuming there are 2 mol of GlcUA/AHP-1.%RhaTerminal30.5GlcUATerminal52.04−8ArafTerminal72.93−95−3GalpTerminal410.03−146−43,6−43a Estimated assuming there are 2 mol of GlcUA/AHP-1. Open table in a new tab To confirm and extend the results of the glycosyl residue and glycosyl-linkage composition analyses, we analyzed AHP-1 by one- and two-dimensional homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Spectra are shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4, and the assignments are reported in Tables II and III. The 1H assignments were obtained from a one-dimensional proton spectrum (Fig. 2), from homonuclear COSY, TOCSY, ROESY (Fig. 4), and NOESY two-dimensional spectra and a heteronuclear HMQC two-dimensional spectrum (not shown). The 13C assignments were established from a combination of two-dimensional HMQC (not shown) and HMBC heteronuclear spectra (Fig. 3) and proton decoupled one-dimensional and DEPT 13C spectra.Fig. 3The AHP-1 HMBC spectrum collected at 60 °C. The two-dimensional heteronuclear HMBC spectrum identified most of the AHP-1 monosaccharide sequence with aid from the glycosyl composition and linkage analyses and the one-dimensional NMR spectrum (Fig. 2). Cross-peak A arose from the signals corresponding to H-1 of Ara residue A1 and C-5 of Ara residue A2 and indicated that A1 was linked to C-5 of A2 (see Table II for residue assignments). Cross-peak B arose from H-1 and C-3 of neighboring Ara residues such as A2-(1→3)-A3 and C1-(1→3)-C2. Cross-peaks C and the two labeled D identified the Ara-(1→3)-Gal linkages, as they arose from correlations between Ara H-1 (A3/C2) and Gal C-3 (Ga/Gb) and between Ara C-1 (A3/C2) and Gal H-3 (Ga/Gb), respectively. Cross-peak E indicated the Rha residue, B1, was linked to position 4 of a GlcUA residue (Rha H-1/GlcA C-4). Cross-peak F indicated the GlcUA residues were linked to position 6 of Gal residues, Ga and Gb (GlcUA H-1/Ga/b C-6). The two cross-peaks G indicated Gal residues Ga and Gb were linked to position 6 of Gal residues G1 and G0 (Ga/b H-1/G1/0 C-6). The two cross-peaks H and three J identified the Gal-(1→3)-Gal residues in the galactan main chain: G1→ G0 and G2→ G1 (H-1 at 4.68 ppm/C-3 at 83.1; C-1 at 105 ppm/H-3 at 3.86 and 3.82 ppm), and G4→ G3 (H-1 at 4.71 ppm/C-3 at 83.0 ppm; C-1 at 105 ppm/H-3 at 3.88 ppm). Finally, cross-peak I identified the Gal G0-(1→4)-O-Hyp linkage.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4The AHP-1 ROESY spectrum collected at 60 °C. The two-dimensional homonuclear ROESY spectrum identified the Gal-(1→6)-Gal link in AHP-1 and the side chain Gal residues, Ga and Gb, linked to position 6 of main chain Gal residues, G0 and G1.

The signal at 4.79 ppm corresponded to H-1 of a single α-l-Rhap residue; although there is no published AGP 1H spectrum indicating the H-1 assignment of α-l-Rhap, identification in the HMQC spectrum (not shown) of the corresponding 13C signal at 101.9 ppm confirmed the Rha H-1 assignment (14Shpak E.

Thus, the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum together with the glycosyl molar ratios showed that AHP-1 is a glycoamino acid containing 15 sugar residues: 7 Gal, 5 Ara, 2 GlcUA, 1 Rha, and 1 Hyp residue. The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum also showed that 1 Ara residue was in a unique chemical environment relative to the other 4 Ara residues (the H-1 signal at 5.09 ppm versus those at 5.25 ppm) and that the 7 Gal residues occur in three distinct chemical environments in a molar ratio of 2:1:4 (H-1 signals at ∼4.5, 4.57, and ∼4.7 ppm). The 13C and 1H resonances corresponding to the Hyp residues were easily distinguished from those of saccharides judging from earlier work (35Gammon D.W. Stephen A.M. Carboh"

SREBP-1c dominates the nutritional regulation of lipogenic genes inverse to gluconeogenesis. Here we show the mechanism by which SREBP-1 suppresses expression of gluconeogenic genes. A series of luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that SREBP-1a and -1c effectively inhibited the PEPCK promoter activity that was induced by HNF-4α. The HNF-4α-binding site in the glucocorticoid-response unit was responsible for the SREBP-1 inhibition, although SREBP-1 did not bind to the PEPCK promoter as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The inhibitory effect was more potent in the isoform of SREBP-1a than SREBP-1c and was eliminated by deletion of the amino-terminal transactivation domain of SREBP-1. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that these two transcription factors directly interact through the transactivation domain of SREBP-1 and the ligand binding/AF2 domains of HNF-4α. Estimation of coactivator recruitment using HNF-4α-Gal4DBD fusion assay showed that SREBP-1 competitively inhibited PGC-1 recruitment, a requirement for HNF-4α activation. Consistent with these results, hepatic PEPCK and Glc-6-Pase mRNA levels are suppressed by overexpression of SREBP-1a and -1c in the transgenic mice. Our data indicate that SREBP-1 has a novel role as negative regulator of gluconeogenic genes through a cross-talk with HNF-4α interference with PGC-1 recruitment.

PEPCK promoter has been extensively studied and shown to be induced by several hormonal stimuli (glucocorticoid, glucagons, and thyroid hormone) and transcriptional factors (cAMP-response element-binding protein, C/EBPα, HNF-3, HNF-4α, and PPARα) (1Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Among these, insulin is a dominant negative regulator of PEPCK promoter through several pathways (1Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF-4α) is a highly conserved member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and was initially identified as a transcriptional factor required for liver-specific gene expression (2Sladek F.M. Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar), although it is also expressed in kidney, intestine, and pancreas (3Drewes T. Senkel S. Holewa B. Ryffel G.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Recently, HNF-4α and a coactivator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1 (PGC-1), have been shown to activate expression of PEPCK (4Hall R.K. Sladek F.M. Granner D.K. Proc.

Crucial roles of HNF-4α and PGC-1 in nutritional regulation of these genes, and thus gluconeogenesis, were confirmed by analysis of liver-specific HNF-4α knockout mice and by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PGC-1 in mouse livers (6Rhee J.

The sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) family has been established as a group of transcription factors regulating transcription of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. SREBP proteins are initially bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane and form a complex with SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), a sterol-sensing molecule. Upon sterol deprivation, SREBP is cleaved to liberate the amino-terminal portion, containing a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domain, and enters the nucleus where it can bind to specific sterol-response elements (SRE) in the promoters of target genes (8Brown M.S.

Although SREBP-2 plays a crucial role in regulation of cholesterol synthesis, SREBP-1c controls gene expression of lipogenic enzymes (11Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin.

Insulin and glucose have been well known to stimulate lipogenesis, presumably through induction of SREBP-1c expression of which is highly nutritionally regulated in the liver and adipose tissue. Recently, we reported (15Yoshikawa T. Ide T. Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Matsuzaka T. Yatoh S. Kitamine T. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Sekiya M. Takahashi A. Hasty A.H. Sato R. Sone H. Osuga J.I.

Considering the physiologically related roles of gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, their transcriptional regulators HNF-4α and SREBP-1c could reciprocally regulate their target genes. In fact, fasting/feeding response to and insulin/glucose effect on these factors are completely opposite. Despite this knowledge, a mutual interaction between these two pathways has never been explored. Here we investigate the effects of SREBPs on the HNF-4α/PGC-1 pathway, and we examine the potential role of SREBPs in the regulation of gluconeogenesis. Animals—SREBP transgenic mice used in this study were described previously (17Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 18Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Mice were housed in colony cages and maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Before time of killing, transgenic animals and littermate controls were placed on the low carbohydrate/high protein diet for 1 week to induce expression of the transgene. Mice were killed after a 12-h fast. Plasmid Construction—Plasmid constructs were produced by using general molecular biology procedures. A series of PEPECK-LUC vectors were generated by inserting the rat PEPCK promoter region (from –1021 to +278, from –480 to +278, or from –335 to +278) amplified by PCR into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). The HNF-4α RE LUC vector containing four copies of HNF-4α-response elements was generated by inserting the double-stranded oligonucleotides of HNF-4α-response element upstream of the native PEPCK TATA box linked to a luciferase gene (pUC8). The expression vectors for human SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2 were constructed as described previously (19Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K.

Transactivation domain-deleted (ΔTA-SREBP-1) SREBP-1 expression plasmid was constructed by inserting PCR-amplified SREBP-1 fragment (90–460 aa) into pcDNA3.1. The expression vector for mouse PGC-1 was generated by inserting PCR-amplified full-length fragment into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The expression vector for mouse HNF-4α was generated by inserting PCR-amplified full-length fragment into pCMV7. The expression vector for Gal4-HNF-4α fusion protein was generated by inserting PCR-amplified HNF-4α fragment (115–455 aa) downstream of Gal4 in the pM vector (Clontech). The expression vector for FLAG-tagged HNF-4α was generated by inserting full-length HNF-4α cDNA fragment downstream of the FLAG tag based on pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The expression vector for c-Myc-tagged SREBP-1a was generated by inserting the fragment of the nuclear form of SREBP-1a into pcDNA3.1 Myc/His (Invitrogen). The expression vectors for GST-SREBP-1a, GST-SREBP-1c, or GST-SREBP-1a (1–100 aa) were generated by inserting the PCR-amplified fragment into pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences). The expression vectors for the HNF-4α partial fragment were generated by inserting the PCR-amplified fragment into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The expression vectors for CBP and p300 (pCMV) were a kind gift from Dr. T. Nakajima. All PCR-based constructions were verified by DNA sequencing. Northern Blotting—Total RNA from mouse livers was prepared with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Equal aliquots of total RNA from mice were subjected to Northern blot analysis. cDNA probes for mouse PEPCK, Glc-6-Pase, and acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO (36B4) were prepared from reverse transcriptase-PCR of mouse liver total RNA with the following primers: 5′-CACACCATTGCAATTATGCCT-3′ and 5′-GCGTTGAATGCTTTCTCAAAGT-3′ for PEPCK; 5′-GCTTGGACTCACTGCACG-3′ and 5′-GACTCTGCATGCCTTACAAAGA-3′ for Glc-6-Pase; and 5′-ATGATTATCCAAAATGCTTCATTG-3′ and 5′-AACAGCATATCCCGAATCTCA-3′ for 36B4. Full-length cDNA was used as cDNA probes for PGC-1 and HNF-4α. Blot hybridization was performed with the cDNA probes for mouse PEPCK, Glc-6-Pase, HNF-4α, PGC-1 and 36B4 labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) using the Mega-prime DNA Labeling System (Amersham Biosciences). Labeled probes were incubated with RNA transferred membranes for 2 h at 65 °C. After washing with washing buffer (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) two times, hybridized membranes were visualized by BAS-2500 (Fuji). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—HepG2 cells were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in minimum Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing non-essential amino acids for minimum Eagle's medium, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Before transfection, HepG2 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well or in 12-well plates at a density of 5.0 × 104 cells/well. After adhesion, cells were transfected with Fu-GENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 0.5 μg/well in 24-well plates or 1.0 μg/well in 12-well plates with empty vector DNA. Forskolin (10–30 μm) (a protein kinase A activator) was added to medium after 4 h of transfection. Me2SO was used as a vehicle-only control. After 24 or 48 h of transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested. Luciferase assays were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol with Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega), and luciferase activity was quantified by using Wallac 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). As the internal standard, SV40 Renilla luciferase control vector was also cotransfected to normalize for transfection efficiency. All experiments were performed in triplicate (mean ± S.D.) GST Pull-down Assay—GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21, DE3) and purified using standard techniques using pGEX-4T according to the manufacturer's protocol. Bacteria culture in ampicillin were grown at 37 °C to A600 of 0.6 before induction with 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 6 h. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in buffer A (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 6% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), (N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal 15 μg/ml). The cells were lysed on ice by sonication and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed for 10 min at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotator with glutathione-Sepharose beads that were preswollen in buffer A. After absorption, beads were wash three times with buffer A. GST or GST fusion proteins were eluted with elution buffer (10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) at room temperature for 10 min. The concentration and sizes of GST and GST fusion proteins were estimated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, using a known quantity of molecular weight standards. After dialysis, the purified samples were stored at –80 °C until pull-down assays were performed. l-[35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were prepared by using TnT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). After GST or GST fusion proteins were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed extensively, a 50% slurry of GST or GST fusion protein-coupled beads were incubated with radiolabeled HNF-4α or PGC-1 in binding buffer (2 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT) for 2 h at 4 °C or room temperature. After beads were washed extensively three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 or 0.1% Nonidet P-40, GST or GST fusion proteins were eluted with elution buffer (10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) at room temperature for 10 min, and labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and gels were dried and visualized with BAS-2500. Coimmunoprecipitation—293T cells were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 293T cells were transfected with the expression vector for FLAG-HNF-4α and c-myc-SREBP-1a by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Before 5 h of harvesting cells, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (15 μg/ml) was added to the medium as a protease inhibitor. After 48 h of transfection, cells were harvested on ice, and nuclear proteins were prepared as described previously (19Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35832-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (800 μg) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-FLAG antibody (mouse monoclonal antibody, Promega) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein G-agarose matrix. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and analyzed on 6% gel by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed by using anti-c-Myc antibody (mouse monoclonal antibody, Roche Applied Science) and anti-HNF-4α antibody (goat polyclonal antibody sc-6556, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—In vitro translated SREBP-1a and HNF-4α proteins were produced using the TnT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by combining equal amounts of the complementary single-stranded DNA in TE buffer followed by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and then gradually cooling to 37 °C. The annealed oligonucleotides were labeled by using the Klenow element of E. coli DNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The binding reactions (final volume of 15 μl) were carried out in binding buffer (2 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT) with labeled probe and 0.4 μg of poly(dI-dC) and TnT reaction lysate. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and then analyzed on 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE at 90 V for 1 h at room temperature. Supershift reactions were performed by adding antibody to the reaction mixture. Antibodies used were sc-6556 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for HNF-4α and sc-8984 for SREBP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After drying, gels were analyzed by BAS-2500 (Fuji). The probe sequence for EMSA is as follows: PEPCK GRU probe (5′-GAATTCCCTTCTCATGACCTTTGGCCGTGGGAGTGACACCTCACAGCTGTGGTGTTTTGACAAC-3′), AF1 site probe (5′-GAATTCCTTCTCATGACCTTTGGCCGTGGGAGTGA-3′), and LDL-R SRE probe (5′-GAAAATCACCCCACTGCAAA-3′). SREBP Inhibits the Transcriptional Activity of HNF-4α Induced by Forskolin—In the process of seeking genes down-regulated by SREBPs, we identified the PEPCK gene by DNA microarray analysis of liver RNAs from SREBP-1a transgenic and wild type mice. The hepatic expression level of PEPCK was 5.3-fold decreased by SREBP-1a overexpression. This result was consistent with the previous report that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SREBP-1c in primary hepatocytes represses mRNA of PEPCK gene induced by cAMP and dexamethasone (20Chakravarty K. Leahy P. Becard D. Hakimi P. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34816-34823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The glucocorticoid-response unit (GRU) has been designated as a functional region to regulate PEPCK gene transcription by cooperation between glucocorticoid receptor and other transcriptional factors in the liver (Fig. 1A). It encompasses the glucocorticoid-response element, AF1, AF2, and AF3 sites. AF1 is the binding site of HNF-4α and is responsible for HNF-4α activation of the PEPCK promoter (4Hall R.K. Sladek F.M. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of SREBP as a regulator of PEPCK promoter activity, we tested whether SREBP could affect the PEPCK promoter in HepG2 cells by using a luciferase reporter gene linked to the rat PEPCK promoter region containing GRU. As shown in Fig. 1C, HNF-4α expression caused induction of PEPCK promoter activity. The HNF-4α transactivation of the PEPCK promoter was markedly enhanced by addition of forskolin, a protein kinase A activator (Fig. 1C), presumably due to protein kinase A phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein, another PEPCK transactivator through the cAMP-response element site (Fig. 1A). Addition of SREBPs resulted in a marked inhibition of the PEPCK promoter activity induced by HNF-4α and forskolin (Fig. 1C). Among the isoforms of SREBPs, SREBP-1a and -2 had the stronger inhibitory effect than SREBP-1c. The difference is likely due to the shorter amino-terminal transactivation domain of SREBP-1c as compared with that of SREBP-1a (Fig. 1B). When the amino-terminal transactivation domain (TA) of SREBP-1 was deleted (ΔTA-SREBP-1, Fig. 1B), the SREBP-1 inhibitory effect on the PEPCK promoter was completely abolished, although this mutant still possessed binding activity to the sterol regulatory element (SRE). These results suggest that the amino-terminal transactivation domain of SREBP is essential for the suppression of HNF-4α/forskolin-induced PEPCK promoter activity. As shown Fig. 1D, the PEPCK promoter activity induced solely by HNF-4α was also repressed by SREBPs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). These data indicated that inhibitory action of SREBPs on PEPCK expression is transcriptional repression mediated through interference with HNF-4α activation. Suppression of PEPCK Promoter by SREBPs Was Mediated through GRU—To identify the cis-acting element responsible for the inhibitory effect of SREBP on HNF-4α, a series of deleted PEPCK promoter LUC plasmids was constructed for transfection studies in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2). In the presence of GRU, luciferase activity was increased greater than 6-fold by HNF-4α, and the absence of the GRU (from –335 to +278) considerably decreased the HNF-4α induction, which is consistent with the previous report that the effective cis-acting element for HNF-4α is the AF1 site in GRU. However, there still remained a slight HNF-4α induction (2-fold) in this construct, which is presumably due to another DR-1 site (AF3). The HNF-4α induction, as observed in GRU-containing luciferase constructs, was equally suppressed by SREBP-1a. Deletion of GRU completely abolished this SREBP suppression. These results demonstrate that GRU is essential for the inhibitory effect of SREBP on HNF-4α activation of the PEPCK promoter. SRE-like Sequences in GRU Are Not Responsible for the Inhibitory Effect of SREBP on HNF-4α—SREBP could function as a negative regulator of transcription by direct binding to the SRE as reported for the promoter of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (21Sato R. Miyamoto W. Inoue J. Terada T. Imanaka T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24714-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 3A, the SRE-like sequences were identified in the GRU of the PEPCK promoter region. However, EMSAs demonstrated that SREBP-1a did not bind to the GRU of the PEPCK promoter, whereas HNF-4α specifically bound to this region (Fig. 3B), excluding the possibility that SREBPs might suppress PEPCK promoter through their direct binding. SREBP Is a Negative Regulator of HNF-4α via PGC-1— Next, we focused on the HNF-4α-response element (HNF-4α-RE) in GRU as an SREBP suppression site. The enhancer construct containing HNF-4α-RE (AF1 site) was transfected into HepG2 cells for these studies (Fig. 4A). Activation of HNF-4α RE-LUC by HNF-4α was markedly enhanced by PGC-1 coexpression in a dose-dependent and saturable manner (Fig. 4B). This result is consistent with the previous report that PGC-1 is an essential coactivator of HNF-4α (7Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4C, both SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c efficiently repressed this PGC-1-mediated HNF-4α activity. These data demonstrate the potential for a direct interaction between HNF-4α and SREBP in this inhibition. SREBP Physically Interacts with HNF-4α in Vitro and in Vivo —To test this possibility, we used GST pull-down assays with GST-SREBP-1 fusion proteins and in vitro translated HNF-4α as the target. As shown Fig. 5A, both GST-SREBP-1a and GST-SREBP-1c, but not GST, were able to pull-down HNF-4α. These results indicate that SREBP-1 could bind HNF-4α in vitro. The amino-terminal region of SREBP-1a GST-SREBP-1a (1–100 aa) was also able to pull down HNF-4α. These data support the concept that the amino-terminal region of SREBP-1 is responsible for its inhibitory effect on HNF-4α. Additionally, under the same conditions, the interaction between SREBP-1a and PGC-1 could not be detected, as shown in Fig. 5A. Lack of SREBP-1/PGC-1 interaction precludes the possibility of competition between HNF-4α and SREBP-1 in PGC-1 recruitment as a plausible mechanism for SREBP-1 inhibition of HNF-4α activity. Next, to determine the binding region in HNF-4α to SREBP, we constructed expression plasmids for different domains of HNF-4α. As shown in Fig. 5B, SREBP-1a-GST protein pulled down both the ligand binding domain (LBD) (115–359 aa) and AF2 of HNF-4α (342–455 aa) with slightly less efficiency, whereas the amino-terminal AF1 and DNA binding domains of HNF-4α (1–130 aa) did not bind to SREBP-1a. The LBD/AF2 part (115–455 aa) showed a comparable signal to the whole molecule of HNF-4α. These data indicated that the binding of these two molecules is mediated through interaction between the TA domain of SREBP and LBD/AF-2 domains of HNF-4α. Finally, the direct interaction between SREBP-1a and HNF-4α was confirmed in vivo; as shown in Fig. 5C, FLAG-HNF-4α was able to coimmunoprecipitate myc-SREBP-1a in 293T cells. SREBP Competes with PGC-1 Recruitment for Activation of HNF-4α—Based upon the direct interaction between SREBP-1 and HNF-4α, two hypotheses for the mechanism of the SREBP inhibitory effect on the HNF-4α-induced PEPCK promoter could be considered: 1) SREBP-HNF-4α interaction impairs the affinity of HNF-4α to bind to HNF4α-RE, or 2) it interferes with the recruitment of PGC-1 by HNF-4α. To examine the first hypothesis, we performed EMSA by using AF1 (HNF-4α-RE) in the PEPCK promoter as a probe. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, the binding of HNF-4α to HNF-4α-RE was not influenced by addition of either SREBP-1a or PGC-1 at the concentrations tested here. Next, to determine whether SREBP-1 has an inhibitory effect on the interaction between HNF-4α and PGC-1, a Gal4-luciferase assay system for evaluation of the recruitment of PGC-1 by HNF-4α was established. HNF-4α LBD and AF2 domain (115–455 aa) were fused to the carboxyl terminus of Gal4 (Fig. 7A). This assessment of coactivator recruitment clearly highlighted PGC-1 and not CBP or p300 as an important coactivator for HNF-4α (Fig. 7B). Fig. 7C shows that PGC-1 dose-dependently increased HNF-4α signaling and that both SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c competitively repressed the PGC-1-dependent luciferase activities. In contrast, the amino-terminal TA-deleted SREBP mutant had no inhibitory effect on this activity. These results indicate that SREBP-1 effectively inhibits the interaction between HNF-4α and PGC-1 through the amino-terminal TA region of SREBP-1. In this inhibition, SREBP-1a was more effective than SREBP-1c.Fig. 7PGC-1 recruitment and coactivation of HNF-4α was inhibited by SREBPs. A, schematic representation of Gal4-HNF-4α fusion protein expression vector and UAS-LUC vector containing eight copies of UAS, Gal4-binding site. Carboxyl-terminal region (115–455 aa) of HNF-4α protein was fused to Gal4-DNA binding domain for estimation of PGC-1 recruitment and coactivation of HNF-4α. B, coactivation of HNF-4α by PGC-1. HepG2 cells in 12-well plates were cotransfected with UAS-LUC vector (300 ng/well), expression vectors for Gal4-HNF-4α fusion protein (300 ng/well), and PGC-1, CBP, or p300 (400 ng/well). Cells were harvested after 24 h of transfection. Luciferase activity was measured and normalized by Renilla luciferase activity. C, SREBP suppression of PGC-1 coactivation.

https://openalex.org/W2131272801,"Malignant transformation of fibroblasts and epithelial cells is often accompanied by increased hyaluronan production and accumulation. Despite recent progress in the study of hyaluronan biosynthesis, the mechanisms underlying the transformation-induced overproduction of hyaluronan have not been elucidated. Here we report that activity and transcriptional levels of hyaluronan synthase (HAS) significantly increased after oncogenic malignant transformation of a rat 3Y1 fibroblast cell line. Of three HAS isoforms (HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3), only HAS2 gene expression was increased in the v-Ha-ras transformed 3Y1 cells, which show less malignancy. In contrast, both HAS1 and HAS2 expressions were elevated in the highly malignant cells transformed with v-src and/or v-fos. To assess the contribution of HAS expression to the oncogenic malignant transformation, we established stable cell transfectants expressing sense and antisense HAS genes. Antisense suppression of the HAS2 expression significantly decreased hyaluronan production in the cells transformed by the oncogenic v-Ha-ras and eventually led to a reduction in tumorigenicity in the rat peritoneum. The introduction of the HAS1 and HAS2 genes promoted the growth of subcutaneous tumors in a manner dependent on the levels of hyaluronan synthesis. Significant growth promotion was observed within a wide range of HAS1 expression. In contrast, the growth stimulation was only seen within a narrow range of HAS2 expression, and high levels of HAS2 expression even inhibited tumor growth. These results suggest that proper regulation of the expression of each HAS isoform is required for optimal malignant transformation and tumor growth.

Lipponen P. Agren U. Alhava E. Kosma V.-M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 342-347Google Scholar). Although increased HA synthesis is not a universal characteristic of tumors, there seems to be a general tendency for transformed cells to exhibit higher levels of HA production. For instance, infections with oncogenic viruses cause an enormous increase in the rate of HA synthesis as well as an abnormal acceleration of cell growth (4Hamerman D. Todaro G.J. Green H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 101: 343-351Google Scholar, 5Ishimoto N. Temin H.M. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2052-2057Google Scholar, 6Hopwood J.J. Dorfman A. J. Biol.

Alterations in the HA synthesis may thus take part in the sequential events leading to cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation. Previous studies have suggested that the increased deposition of the HA-rich matrix provides a suitable environment for cell proliferation and migration during tumor development (8Turley E.A.

Furthermore, tumor-associated HA is correlated with metastatic abilities of mouse mammary carcinoma and B16 melanoma cell lines (12Kimata K. Honma Y. Okayama M. Oguri K. Hozumi M. Suzuki S. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1347-1354Google Scholar, 13Turley E.A. Tretiak M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5098-5105Google Scholar, 14Zhang L. Underhill C.B. Chen L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 428-433Google Scholar). HA is a linear polysaccharide composed of the repeating disaccharide N-acetyl-d-glucosamine-β(1→4)-d-glucuronic acid-β(1→3). This polysaccharide is not simply a structural component of the extracellular matrix but also regulates a variety of cell properties such as cell adhesion, motility, growth, and differentiation by acting on intracellular signaling pathways through interaction with cell surface receptors (15Lee J.Y. Spicer A.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 581-586Google Scholar, 16Toole B.P. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 79-87Google Scholar, 17Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of HA, which is critical in establishing its biological form, is multiply regulated by three mammalian HA synthases; HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3 (18Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Google Scholar, 19Itano N. Kimata K. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1998; 10: 23-38Google Scholar, 20Spicer A.P. Nguyen T.K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 109-115Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that the three HAS isoforms differ from each other in the expression profiles during embryonic development and in the enzymatic characteristics (21Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Google Scholar, 22Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Google Scholar). Furthermore, the respective HAS transfectants clearly differ in their ability to form the HA matrix and in the molecular masses of the HA produced by them. Because HA has a wide variety of biological and physiological roles, some of which are size-dependent, the existence of three different HAS isoforms implies that HA functions are diversely regulated through control of the activities and expressions of the HAS isoforms. It is therefore plausible that the HAS isoforms are involved in different stages of malignant tumor progression. Molecular cloning of the HAS genes enabled us to control HA biosynthesis and investigate HA functions in malignant transformation (23Itano N. Sawai T. Miyaishi O. Kimata K.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5207-5214Google Scholar). Moreover, the expression of HAS1 restored the metastatic potential of mouse mammary carcinoma mutants that had low levels of HA synthesis and metastatic ability (23Itano N. Sawai T. Miyaishi O.

Our recent study demonstrated that an abnormal accumulation of HA matrix induced by the overexpression of HAS genes diminished contact inhibition of nontransformed cells (31Itano N. Atsumi F. Sawai T. Yamada Y. Miyaishi O. Senga T. Hamaguchi M. Kimata K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3609-3614Google Scholar). Although increasing evidence suggested the involvement of HA in the transformation, tumorigenesis, and malignant progression, the expression patterns and the respective roles of the three mammalian HAS isoforms during the oncogenic transformation had not been studied in the same cell systems. The rat 3Y1 fibroblastic cell line has been utilized as a model system to study transforming activities of oncogenes (32Kimura G. Itagaki A. Summers J. Int. J. Cancer. 1975; 15: 694-706Google Scholar, 33Shimura H. Ohtsu M. Matsuzaki A. Mitsudomi T. Onodera K. Kimura G. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 578-583Google Scholar, 34Tanaka H. Zaitsu H. Onodera K. Kimura G.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6555-6563Google Scholar). Transformed 3Y1 cells bearing adenovirus E1A fragment or simian virus 40 show slow rate of tumorigenesis despite of the increases in both saturation cell density and anchorage-independent growth (33Shimura H. Ohtsu M. Matsuzaki A. Mitsudomi T. Onodera K. Kimura G. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 578-583Google Scholar, 35Zaitsu H. Kimura G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 82-88Google Scholar). On the other hand, cell transformation driven by v-Ha-ras or v-src causes significantly high tumorigenesis or acquires metastatic potential (35Zaitsu H. Kimura G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 82-88Google Scholar, 36Taniguchi S. Tatsuka M. Nakamatsu K. Inoue M. Sadano H. Okazaki H. Iwamoto H. Baba T. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6738-6744Google Scholar, 37Thant A.A. Sein T.T. Liu E. Machida K. Kikkawa F. Koike T. Seiki M. Matsuda S. Hamaguchi M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6555-6563Google Scholar). Here the transformed 3Y1 cell lines that have different degrees of transforming ability were examined the changes in HAS activity and transcriptional levels during the malignant transformation. Furthermore, we generated stable cell lines expressing sense or antisense HAS genes in ras-transformed 3Y1 cells to assess the contribution and role of the HAS expression in malignant transformation. We show here for the first time that oncogenic malignant transformation and subsequent tumor growth are crucially regulated by proper levels of HA concentration and synthase expression. This novel finding provides a new insight for understanding the physiological significance of HA production during tumor development. In addition, it would be an important knowledge about the molecular basis and regulatory mechanisms underlying oncogene-induced overproduction of HA. Cell Lines—Rat 3Y1 fibroblast cell lines transformed by various oncogenes, E1A-3Y1, SV-3Y1, HR-3Y1, and SR-3Y1, were obtained from Riken Bioresource Center (Ibaraki, Japan). HR-3Y1 and SR 3Y1 cells were previously established as cell lines bearing v-Ha-ras and v-src, respectively. v-fos SR 3Y1 cells bearing v-src and v-fos was prepared as described previously (36Taniguchi S. Tatsuka M. Nakamatsu K. Inoue M. Sadano H. Okazaki H. Iwamoto H. Baba T. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6738-6744Google Scholar). S17N SR-3Y1 cells bearing a dominant negative form with Asn substituted for Ser at position 17 of v-Ha-Ras were also prepared as described previously (38Wang X. Thant A.A. Machida K. Hiraiwa Y. Iwata H. Matsuda S. Hamaguchi M. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 1097-1101Google Scholar). All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine (growth medium). Particle Exclusion Assays—Fixed erythrocytes were reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a density of 5 × 108 cells/ml and used for the particle exclusion assay as described previously (22Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Google Scholar, 39Itano N. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9875-9878Google Scholar). HA matrices were visualized by adding 1 × 107 erythrocytes to the growth medium and viewing under an Olympus IMT-2 inverted phase-contrast microscope. The ratios of HA pericellular coats to cell areas were determined by image analysis using National Institutes of Health Image (version 1.57) software. All measurements were made by tracing digitized images. Determination of HA Concentrations by Competitive ELISA-like Assay—The HA contents of the conditioned medium in exponentially growing cultures were measured by a modified competitive ELISA-like assay (22Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Google Scholar, 39Itano N. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9875-9878Google Scholar). Briefly, 3Y1, E1A-3Y1, SV-3Y1, HR-3Y1, SR-3Y1, and v-fos SR-3Y1 cell lines were cultured for 2 days, and the conditioned medium was recovered. The conditioned medium was also recovered from S17N SR-3Y1 cells incubated with or without 2 μm dexamethasone (Sigma) for 2 days. A mixture of conditioned medium and the biotinylated HA-binding region of aggrecan (b-HABP, Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was added to 96-well plates precoated with HA-bovine serum albumin and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was used as secondary probe, and the enzymatic activity was measured using o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) as a substrate. The HA contents were calculated from a standard curve obtained using serial dilutions of standard HA. HA Synthase Assays—HAS activity was monitored using UDP-[14C]GlcA (325.9 mCi/mmol, ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA) as described previously (22Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Google Scholar, 39Itano N. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9875-9878Google Scholar). Briefly, the crude membrane fractions isolated from subconfluent 3Y1 cells and oncogenic transformants were resuspended and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 0.2 ml of 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.1, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm UDP-GlcNAc (Sigma), 2 μm UDP-GlcA (Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), and 2 μCi of UDP-[14C]GlcA. Reactions were terminated by adding SDS at 2% (w/v). The incorporation of radioactivity into high molecular mass HA was measured by descending paper chromatography using Whatman 3MM paper developed in 1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.5, and ethanol (35:65, v/v). The amounts of radioactivity at the origins were measured by liquid scintillation counting. The HAS activity was determined by calculating the amounts of GlcA incorporated using known specific radioactivities. Quantitative Analyses of the HAS Transcripts—Relative levels of HAS expression in oncogenic transformed cells were determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR as described previously (23Itano N. Sawai T. Miyaishi O. Kimata K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2499-2504Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences of rat HAS1 and HAS3 were obtained from a BLAST search of the rat genome data base using nucleotide sequences of the mouse HAS1 and HAS3 as queries. Gene-specific PCR primers and probes designed on the basis of the rat HAS sequences by Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) are as follows: the forward primer for HAS1 was 5′-GGAGATGTGAGAATCCTTAACCCTC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-TGCTGGCTCAGCCAACGAAGGAA-3′; the probe for HAS1 was 5′-CAGAGCTACTTTCACTGTGTGTCCTGCATC-3′; the forward primer for HAS2 was 5′-CCTCGGAATCACAGCTGCTTATA-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CTGCCCATGACTTCACTGAAGA-3′; the probe for HAS2 was 5′-TCACACCTCATCATCCAAAGCCTCTTTG-3′; the forward primer for HAS3 was 5′-GGTACCATCAGAAGTTCCTAGGCAGC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GAGGAGAATGTTCCAGATGCG-3′; the probe for HAS3 was 5′-TGGCTACCGGACTAAGTATACAGCACGCTC-3′. Total RNAs were isolated from subconfluent 3Y1, HR-3Y1, SR-3Y1, and v-fos SR-3Y1 cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Irvine, CA). Total RNA samples were also isolated from S17N SR-3Y1 cells incubated with or without 2 μm dexamethasone for 2 days. Two hundred nanograms of total RNA was used for real-time RT-PCR and subsequent analysis. The conditions for RT-PCR were as follows; 1 cycle at 50 °C for 2 min, 1 cycle at 60 °C for 30 min, 1 cycle at 95 °C for 5 min, 50 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. Fluorescent signals generated during PCR amplifications were monitored in real-time using the 7700 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed with the sequence detector 1.7 program (Applied Biosystems). The relative amounts of GAPDH mRNA were measured using TaqMan rodent GAPDH detection reagents (Applied Biosystems). Comparison of the amount of each HAS mRNA among different samples was made using the values that were obtained by normalizing the amount of each mRNA divided by that of the GAPDH mRNA in each sample and designated as the “relative expression coefficient” in this study. Standard curves were generated by serial dilution of total RNA isolated from SR-3Y1. Establishment of Stable Transfectants Expressing HAS Genes—The cDNAs for mouse HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3 were subcloned into the pEXneo mammalian expression vector as described previously (22Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Google Scholar). A mouse HAS2 full-length cDNA was also subcloned in the antisense orientation into the pEXneo vector. Sense and antisense constructs were then transfected into HR-3Y1 cells using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and selecting the transfectants in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418. The cells surviving during the selection were further cloned by limiting dilution. A HAS2 mutant that contains the amino acid substitution of Trp-354 to Tyr at the catalytic site was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PCR reaction was performed using Pfu DNA polymerase and the following primers: forward primer, 5′-CAGCAGACCCGATACAGCAAGTCCTACTTCCG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CGGAAGTAGGACTTGCTGTATCGGGTCTGCTG-3′. The nucleotide sequence of the mutant HAS2 cDNA was confirmed by sequencing. Mouse HAS1, HAS2, and the mutant HAS2 cDNAs were subcloned in the pIRES2-EGFP vector (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). HR-3Y1 cells were transfected with the constructs, and the G418-resistant colonies were picked and further enriched five times by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The clones stably expressing EGFP at the different levels were selected and used for the experiments. HA matrix formation, HA accumulation in the conditioned medium, and the HAS activity were determined as described in this section. Estimation of the Amounts of FLAG-tagged Recombinant HAS Proteins—Amounts of FLAG-tagged HAS fusion proteins in HAS transfectants were estimated by immunoblotting as described previously (22Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Google Scholar). In this study, whole proteins of transfectants were solubilized, separated on SDS-PAGE, and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blotting was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using anti-FLAG peptide antibody M5 (Sigma) followed by anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with peroxidase. The FLAG-tagged protein bands were quantified by densitometric scanning of the digitized image using NIH Image (version 1.57) software. A standard curve for each measurement was created by immunoblotting of known amounts of FLAG-tagged bacterial alkaline phosphatase (FLAG-BAP, molecular mass of 49.4 kDa). The amounts of recombinant HAS protein were expressed in arbitrary units with band intensity equivalent to 1 ng of FLAG-BAP. Soft Agar Growth Assay—Six-well plates were coated with 1 ml of 0.6% agarose in growth medium. Then, 2 × 105 cells from each transfectant were suspended in 0.2 ml of growth medium, mixed with 3.8 ml of 0.3% agarose in growth medium (52 °C), and divided into two agarose-coated wells. After solidification of the agarose, 3 ml of growth medium was added to each well. The medium was exchanged every 3 days for 1 month, and the colonies were counted every week. Tumor Formation—The HR-3Y1 cells stably expressing sense or antisense HAS were cultured in the growth medium and harvested by trypsinization. After inactivation of trypsin by the addition of serum, the cells were washed with PBS and suspended to a single cell level with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Then, 1 ml of 2.5 × 106 cells was injected into the peritoneal cavities of 8-week-old female Fisher 344 rats (Charles River Japan Inc., Kanagawa, Japan). After 1 month, the rats were sacrificed and examined for the formation of tumors. The number of macroscopic nodules (>1 mm in diameter) in the peritoneal cavity was counted. The HAS transfectants were harvested and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml as described above. The cell suspensions (200 μl) were subcutaneously injected in the left flanks of nude mice (6-week-old female BALB/c mice; SLC, Shizuoka, Japan). The appearance of visible tumors was monitored, and the tumor size in all of the mice was measured for 42 days using a dial caliper. The tumor volume (V) was determined by the following equation: V = (L × W2) × 0.5, where L is the length and W is the width of a tumor. All animal experiments were performed according to the Aichi Medical University Guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were conducted using the Student's t test. Significantly different results were indicated at p values. Enhanced HA Production and Matrix Formation in Oncogenic Malignant Transformation—We first assessed the levels of HA production and matrix formation in various oncogenic transformants. When the HA matrices were visualized by particle exclusion assay and by fluorescent staining with b-HABP, increased matrix formation was observed around the cell surfaces of both ras- and v-src-transformed rat 3Y1 cells, which were designated as HR-3Y1 and SR-3Y1 cells, respectively (Fig. 1). The HA production of the parental and the transformed cells was assessed by measuring the amounts of HA secreted into the culture medium. HA accumulation in the conditioned medium was ∼3-fold and 5-fold higher in the tumorigenic HR-3Y1 and the metastatic SR-3Y1 cells, respectively, than in parental 3Y1 (Fig. 2A). The highest level of HA production was detected in the highly metastatic v-fos SR-3Y1 cells. In contrast, the increase in HA production was not significant in the less malignant cells transformed with the adenovirus E1A fragment or simian virus 40. Therefore, the current results suggest a close association of the HA production with the malignancy of the transformed cells. To clarify the primary step responsible for the enhanced HA production, HAS activity was measured and compared with that of the parental cells. A good correlation was found between the HAS activity and the HA production (Fig. 2), suggesting that the HA production enhanced by oncogenic transformation was mainly due to the up-regulation of the HAS activity.Fig. 2HA synthesis and HAS activity of the 3Y1 cells and their oncogenic transformants. HA synthesis (A) and HAS activity (B) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” HA synthesis was determined as the amount of HA secreted into the culture medium, because of the limited amounts of HA in the matrix fractions. S17N SR-3Y1 cells were incubated with (+Dex) or without (-Dex) 2 μm dexamethasone for 2 days, and the conditioned medium and crude membrane fractions were used for determinations of HA synthesis and HAS activity, respectively. Data were obtained from triplicate experiments and are given as the mean ± S.D. C, HAS activity was measured after S17N SR-3Y1 cells were incubated with 2 μm dexamethasone for the indicated period of time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the Ras-MAP kinase cascade is a major signaling pathway constitutively activated by v-src. We therefore investigated the contribution of the Ras signaling pathway to the Src-enhanced HA synthesis in culture systems using S17N SR-3Y1 cells, in which the dominant negative S17N ras is expressed in a dexamethasone-inducible manner. A previous study demonstrated that the relative amount of GTP-bound Ras was dramatically decreased by the expression of a dominant negative S17N Ras (37Thant A.A. Sein T.T. Liu E. Machida K. Kikkawa F. Koike T. Seiki M. Matsuda S. Hamaguchi M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6555-6563Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, induction of the dominant negative S17N Ras in the presence of dexamethasone suppressed HA production by 50%, and the effect was time-dependent (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that constitutive activation of the Ras-signaling pathway in src-transformed cells may cause the up-regulation of HA biosynthesis. Because the HA synthesis is closely associated with HAS activity, we decided to investigate the transcriptional regulation of each HAS isoform in oncogenic malignant transformation. Up-regulation of HAS Transcription by Oncogenic Malignant Transformation—We used a real-time RT-PCR method to examine whether enhancement of the HAS transcription accounts for the enhanced HA synthesis in oncogenic transformation. Equal amounts of mRNA from the parental and the transformed 3Y1 cell lines were used for the RT-PCR amplification of these HAS transcripts. Fluorescence intensity was monitored in real-time during PCR amplifications, and the expression levels of the HAS isoforms were calculated as a relative expression coefficient using standard curves that was generated by serial dilution of total RNA isolated from SR-3Y1 cells (Fig. 3). Variation in the efficiency of reverse transcription was normalized with a GAPDH housekeeping control mRNA. The transcriptional levels of HAS1 and HAS2 were relatively low in the parental 3Y1 cells, consistent with the low level of HA synthesis. The HAS2 transcript was five times more abundant in the HR-3Y1 cells than in the parental 3Y1 cells, whereas there was no significant change in the mRNA levels of HAS1 and HAS3. Besides the similar levels of HAS2 expression in HR-3Y1 and SR-3Y1, a marked increase in the HAS1 expression was detected in the SR-3Y1 and v-fos SR-3Y1 cells, but there was no change in the HAS3 expression in these transformants. These comparative analyses suggest that the enhanced HA synthesis is attributable to the up-regulation of HAS2 transcription in the HR-3Y1 cells and those of HAS1 and HAS2 isoforms in the SR-3Y1 and v-fos SR-3Y1 cells. Induction of the dominant negative S17N Ras resulted in the suppression of HAS1 and HAS2 transcription in the SR-3Y1 cells, wherea"
https://openalex.org/W2020967120,"The cytotoxic effect of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is limited in many glioma cell lines. However, treatment with TRAIL in combination with subtoxic doses of roscovitine, a specific inhibitor of Cdc2 and Cdk2, induced rapid apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant glioma cells. Roscovitine could sensitize Bcl-2- or Bcl-xL-overexpressing glioma cells, but not human astrocytes, to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, offering an attractive strategy for safely treating resistant gliomas. Treatment with roscovitine significantly inhibited Cdc2 activity, and expression of a dominant-negative Cdc2 mutant sensitized glioma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. While the proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 by TRAIL was partially blocked in U87MG and T98 glioma cells, treatment with roscovitine recovered TRAIL-induced activation of caspases very efficiently in these cells. We found that treatment with roscovitine or expression of a dominant-negative Cdc2 mutant downregulated the protein levels of survivin and XIAP, two major caspase inhibitors. Overexpression of survivin or XIAP attenuated the apoptosis induced by roscovitine and TRAIL. Taken together, these results suggest that downregulation of survivin and XIAP by subtoxic doses of roscovitine contributes to the amplification of caspase cascades, thereby overcoming glioma cell resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2055601782,"At glutamatergic synapses, the scaffolding protein PSD95 links the neuronal isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) to the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Phosphorylation of nNOS at serine 847 (Ser847) by the calcium-calmodulin protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibits nNOS activity, possibly by blocking the binding of Ca2+-CaM. Here we show that the NMDA mediates a novel bidirectional regulation of Ser847 phosphorylation. nNOS phosphorylated at Ser847 colocalizes with the NMDA receptor at spines of cultured hippocampal neurons. Treatment of neurons with 5 μm glutamate stimulated CaMKII phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser847, whereas excitotoxic concentrations of glutamate, 100 and 500 μm, induced Ser847-PO4 dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1. Strong NMDA receptor stimulation was likely to activate nNOS under these conditions because protein nitration to form nitrotyrosine, a marker of nNOS activity, correlated in individual neurons with Ser847-PO4 dephosphorylation. Of particular note, stimulation with low glutamate that increased phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser847 could be reversed by subsequent high glutamate treatment which induced dephosphorylation. The reversibility of NMDA receptor-induced phosphorylation at Ser847 by different doses of glutamate suggests two mechanisms with opposite effects: 1) a time-dependent negative feedback induced by physiological concentrations of glutamate that limits nNOS activation and precludes the overproduction of NO; and 2) a pathological stimulation by high concentrations of glutamate that leads to unregulated nNOS activation and production of toxic levels of NO. These mechanisms may share pathways, respectively, with NMDA receptor-induced forms of synaptic plasticity and excitotoxicity.

In addition, it has been shown that the activity of nNOS undergoes complex regulation by phosphorylation (21Bredt D.S. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10976-10981Google Scholar, 22Nakane M. Mitchell J. Forstermann U. Murad F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1396-1402Google Scholar, 23Hayashi Y. Nishio M. Naito Y. Yokokura H. Nimura Y. Hidaka H. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20597-20602Google Scholar). Of particular note, the protein kinase CaMKII phosphorylates recombinant nNOS at Ser847, which reduces nNOS activity by inhibiting the binding of Ca2+-CaM (23Hayashi Y. Nishio M. Naito Y. Yokokura H. Nimura Y. Hidaka H. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20597-20602Google Scholar, 24Komeima K. Hayashi Y. Naito Y. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28139-28143Google Scholar). However, the NMDAR-induced mechanism of regulation of nNOS by phosphorylation at specific residues remains largely unknown. We have shown previously that mutations at the apex of the pore of the NMDAR NR1 subunit which block Ca2+ entry through the channel reduce NMDAR-dependent excitotoxicity in heterologous cells and neurons (25Rameau G.A. Akaneya Y. Chiu L. Ziff E.B. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2255-2266Google Scholar). Because Ca2+-dependent activation of nNOS by the NMDAR has been linked to NMDAR excitotoxic effects (6Dawson V.L.

Aging. 2003; 24: 1123-1133Google Scholar), we have also analyzed the NMDAR-mediated mechanism of modulation of phosphorylation of nNOS. We have shown that after excitotoxic activation of the NMDAR in cultured primary cortical neurons, nNOS undergoes an overall dephosphorylation by a pathway dependent on the phosphatases calcineurin and PP1/PP2A (30Rameau G.A. Chiu L.Y. Ziff E.B. Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24: 1123-1133Google Scholar). It is well established that the effectiveness of synapses and even the viability of the neuron can be altered by NMDAR-dependent activity that can be achieved by various patterns of stimulation. Here, we analyze the effects of NMDAR activation on the level of phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser847, a modification implicated in the regulation of nNOS. We show that the NMDAR induces a novel bidirectional control of phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser847. Using an antibody specific for Ser847-PO4 nNOS, GR847, we show that nNOS phosphorylated at this site is localized in proximity to NMDAR·PSD95 complexes at synapses. Differential activation of the NMDAR in dissociated cortical neurons in culture with varying concentrations of glutamate leads to opposing effects on nNOS phosphorylation at Ser847. Stimulation with a low concentration of glutamate resulted in a time-dependent phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser847 by CaMKII. In contrast, high pathological concentrations of glutamate stimulated dephosphorylation of Ser847-PO4. The first of these effects may share similarity with a form of long term potentiation induced by theta pulse stimulation of hippocampal neurons which promotes the activation of CaMKII (31Brown G.P. Blitzer R.D. Connor J.H. Wong T. Shenolikar S. Iyengar R. Landau E.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7880-7887Google Scholar, 32Kang-Park M.H. Sarda M.A. Jones K.H. Moore S.D. Shenolikar S. Clark S.

Strikingly, after the 5 μm glutamate induction of phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser847, nNOS remains sensitive to subsequent dephosphorylation when neurons are exposed to the excitotoxic glutamate concentration. These results support bidirectional regulation of NMDAR-mediated phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser847. Cortical and Hippocampal Cell Cultures—Cultured E18 rat cortical and hippocampal neurons were prepared as described previously (25Rameau G.A. Akaneya Y. Chiu L. Ziff E.B. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2255-2266Google Scholar). Briefly, after dissociation, cortical cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated dishes or coverslips in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.45% glucose, and 1 mm pyruvate. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 for 3 h, and the medium was exchanged for neurobasal medium plus B-27 supplement plus 0.5 mm glutamine. For immunocytochemistry, the cultures were treated with AraC until non-neuronal cells were absent. Under these conditions 99% of the cells are neurons, which could be identified reliably by morphology and by immunolabeling of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2). Immunocytochemistry—Hippocampus-derived neurons on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde plus 4% sucrose for 15 min and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature, or they were fixed with 100% methanol at 0 °C for 15 min. After several washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated in 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and subsequently stained with a polyclonal antibody to nitrotyrosine (NT) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and a monoclonal antibody to MAP-2 (Upstate Biotechnology). Detection was performed using a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Cy5 (blue channel) and goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to either rhodamine or fluorescein (Jackson ImmunoResearch and Molecular Probes) (red or green channel). Immunoreactivity was examined using a Nikon PCM2000 confocal laser scanning microscope. Quantitation of NT and pSer847 in Individual Neurons—C-imaging Systems software was used to quantify the fluorescence intensity of the antibody-conjugated fluorochromes in images acquired by confocal microscopy. Identical confocal settings were used for each set of experiments. Neurons were first selected by establishing a threshold of MAP-2 fluorescence intensity (blue channel). Dendritic NT or Ser847-PO4 nNOS was measured by eliminating the cell body for quantitation from the image, using a software-based “erasure” method. The levels of Ser847-PO4 nNOS and NT were calculated for each identified cell by determining the magnitudes of red and green channel signals within the selected dendrites. The signal from an average of 200 neurons/coverslip was averaged to obtain a population mean (presented as the mean ± S.E.). Statistical significance of differences between means was calculated using Student's t test. Immunoblotting—The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline on ice, scraped, and transferred into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes that were spun for 1 min at maximum speed. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, plus 0.1% deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) plus tablets of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) plus the phosphatase inhibitors, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 μm microcystin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C with rocking. Cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant fractions were collected, 300-μg aliquots were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (final concentration 1×). Equivalent amounts of total protein were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hydrobond-C nitrocellulose blots (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies—Anti-Ser847-PO4 nNOS serum was generated by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic phosphopeptide synthesized by the Tufts University Core Facility (Boston) corresponding to 11 amino acids in nNOS NH2-CKVRFN(S-PO4)VSSYS-COOH. Antibodies were generated and affinity purified by Covance (Princeton, NJ). Anti-PSD95 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, and monoclonal anti-synaptophysin from Sigma and polyclonal anti-MAP-2 from (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired Student's t test and analysis of variance post hoc test Bonferroni/Dunn, using Stat View (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). Detection of S847-PO4 nNOS and Phosphorylation of nNOS by CaMKII—The phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser847 has been detected by Western blotting of brain lysates (23Hayashi Y. Nishio M. Naito Y. Yokokura H. Nimura Y. Hidaka H. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20597-20602Google Scholar), and CaMKIIα has been implicated in the phosphorylation of nNOS at this position (23Hayashi Y. Nishio M. Naito Y. Yokokura H. Nimura Y. Hidaka H. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20597-20602Google Scholar, 24Komeima K. Hayashi Y. Naito Y. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28139-28143Google Scholar). We confirmed by an in vitro [γ-32P]ATP labeling assay that CaMKIIα phosphorylates recombinant nNOS expressed in Escherichia coli (Fig. 1A). To study the mechanism of NMDAR-induced regulation of nNOS phosphorylation at Ser847, we used an affinity-purified anti-phosphopeptide antiserum, GR847, specific to the Ser847-PO4 nNOS form. GR847 recognizes nNOS phosphorylated in vitro by CaMKIIα (Fig. 1B, lane 2) but did not detect either unphosphorylated nNOS (Fig. 1B, lane 1) or nNOS phosphorylated by Akt or protein kinase C (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). Reprobing the blot for total nNOS showed that each lane contained an equal amount of nNOS and demonstrated that GR847 does not recognize unphosphorylated nNOS. GR847 specifically recognized in neuronal lysates two nNOS forms identified previously in rodent brain, the 155-kDa nNOSα and to a lesser extent the 135-kDa nNOSβ (1Garthwaite J. Garthwaite G. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 172: 413-416Google Scholar, 23Hayashi Y. Nishio M. Naito Y. Yokokura H. Nimura Y. Hidaka H. Watanabe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20597-20602Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). We confirmed the identity of the major 155 kDa α band as nNOS by reprobing the blot with nNOS antibody (Transduction Laboratories) (Fig. 1D), thereby demonstrating the specificity of GR847 for detecting Ser847-PO4 nNOS. Localization of Ser847-PO4 nNOS at Synapses in Hippocampal Neurons—Interaction of nNOS with PSD95 localizes nNOSα at synapses (19Christopherson K.S. Hillier B.J. Lim W.A. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27467-27473Google Scholar, 20Aarts M. Liu Y. Liu L. Besshoh S. Arundine M. Gurd J.W. Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Tymianski M. Science. 2002; 298: 846-850Google Scholar, 37Burette A.

Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Google Scholar). nNOSα also interacts in the cytoplasm with the protein Capon (39Fang M. Jaffrey S.R. Sawa A. Ye K. Luo X. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2000; 28: 183-193Google Scholar) and with carboxyl-terminal-binding protein (CtBP) (40Riefler G.M. Firestein B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48262-48268Google Scholar) and synapsin (41Jaffrey S.R. Benfenati F. Snowman A.M. Czernik A.J. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3199-3204Google Scholar). The nNOS splice variant, nNOSβ, has full catalytic activity and is expressed predominantly during development (42Brenman J.E. Xia H. Chao D.S. Black S.M. Bredt D.S. Dev. Neurosci. 1997; 19: 224-231Google Scholar, 43Eliasson M.J. Blackshaw S. Schell M.J. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3396-3401Google Scholar). In contrast to nNOSα, nNOSβ lacks the PDZ targeting domain that interacts with PSD95, and thus its subcellular distribution is likely to be mainly nonsynaptic and cytoplasmic. Previous studies have shown that synaptic puncta, identified by synaptophysin staining, were associated with nNOSα (37Burette A. Zabel U. Weinberg R.J. Schmidt H.H. Valtschanoff J.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8961-8970Google Scholar). We extended these studies by determining the extent of colocalization of Ser847-PO4 nNOS with PSD95 and the synaptic marker, synaptophysin, in E18 rat hippocampus-derived neuronal cultures 21 days in vitro. Ser847-PO4 nNOS and PSD95 colocalized in spine-like structures on dendrites (arrows, Fig. 2, A-C), consistent with an interaction between Ser847-PO4 nNOS and PSD95. In cultured neurons with a pyramidal morphology, Ser847-PO4 nNOS appeared as brightly stained puncta on dendritic structures that resemble spines. Ser847-PO4 nNOS also colocalized with the synaptic marker, synaptophysin (arrow, Fig. 2, D-F). The labeling also occurred on the edges of the soma and diffusely in the cytoplasm. Therefore, in addition to an apparent concentration at synapses in spine-like structures along the dendrites, Ser847-PO4 nNOS was also observed in the cytoplasm. In agreement with tethering of nNOS to the NMDAR by PSD95, staining for PSD95 and total nNOS also revealed (Fig. 2, G-I) the punctate localization of these proteins in spine-like structures along dendrites (arrows). NMDAR-dependent Phosphorylation of Ser847 by CaMKII—The manner of stimulation of the NMDAR with glutamate determines distinct types of synaptic changes or excitotoxicity (44Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 369-379Google Scholar, 45Bear M.F. Malenka R.C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 389-399Google Scholar, 46Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Google Scholar). Also, NMDAR activation in cultured neurons by glutamate induces a Ca2+-dependent activation of CaMKII that regulates gene expression (47Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 181-186Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that glutamate acting through the NMDAR might induce CaMKII phosphorylation of Ser847. We examined the regulation of Ser847-PO4 nNOS after neuron treatment with 5 μm glutamate, a concentration that is considered to fall within a physiological range (48McBain C.J. Mayer M.L. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 723-760Google Scholar). Neuron stimulation with 5 μm glutamate showed a robust increase in phosphorylation at Ser847 (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 5). Phosphorylation at Ser847 was observed 15 min after stimulation and continued to increase from 30 o 60 min (Fig. 3A, lanes 3-5) relative to the unstimulated control (Fig. 3B, lane 1). Reprobing of this blot for total nNOS confirmed equal loading of proteins. Quantification of several experiments showed that at 60 min of treatment, Ser847-PO4 had increased up to 5-fold relative to its constitutive level (Fig. 3B). We next distinguished between two possibilities that could account for the NMDAR-mediated increase in phosphorylation at Ser847: 1) the increase in phosphorylation may be caused by the elevated activity of kinases, or 2) the increase could result from the inhibition of the activities of phosphatases. We distinguished these possibilities by blocking the activity of CaMKII, a kinase that was likely to mediate NMDAR-dependent phosphorylation at Ser847. KN93, a specific inhibitor of CaMKII, blocked the 5 μm glutamate-induced increase in Ser847-PO4 (Fig. 3C, lane 3) relative to the control, stimulation with 5 μm glutamate alone (Fig. 3C, lane 2). As a further control, KN93 alone did not have any effect on the phosphorylation levels at Ser847 (Fig. 3C, lane 4), suggesting that the constitutive pool of Ser847-PO4 nNOS is either relatively stable or not dependent on CaMKII for its maintenance. d-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoate, an NMDAR antagonist, blocked the increase, indicating that this phosphorylation of Ser847 is mediated by an NMDAR-dependent mechanism (Fig. 3C, lane 5). The NMDAR-dependent modulation of phosphorylation at Ser847 observed here is consistent with our previous studies (30Rameau G.A. Chiu L.Y. Ziff E.B. Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24: 1123-1133Google Scholar) that showed that NMDAR modulation of phospho-nNOS levels was independent of AMPA receptor or voltage-sensitive calcium channel activity. Protein phosphorylation is maintained in a steady state by the concurrent actions of kinases and phosphatases, and the levels of Ser847-PO4 observed in control cells may reflect the outcome of opposing phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. To understand the basis of Ser847 constitutive phosphorylation, we measured Ser847-PO4 levels in the presence of okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor that blocks two phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A. We took advantage of the fact that different OA concentrations are required to inhibit PP2A (Ki = 0.1 nm) and PP1 (Ki = 15 nm). We exposed cultured neurons to different levels of OA for 1 h. Concentrations of OA that inhibit PP1 (10 and 100 nm) increased Ser847-PO4 up to 4-fold (Fig. 3D, lanes 3 and 4) relative to an untreated control (Fig. 3D, lane 1). OA at 1 nm, which inhibits only PP2A, in contrast did not induce an increase in Ser847-PO4 nNOS levels (Fig. 3D, lane 2). These results indicate that PP1 decreases the level of constitutive phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser847. NMDAR-dependent Ser847 Dephosphorylation by PP1—To prevent excitotoxic death of cultured neurons, it is necessary to limit the exposure of these neurons to concentrations of glutamate in the low micromolar ranges, although it is estimated that the peak concentration of glutamate at synapses in vivo to be in the millimolar range (49Clements J.D. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 163-171Google Scholar, 50Diamond J.S. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4672-4687Google Scholar). Exposure of NMDARs to elevated levels of glutamate is the primary cause of neuronal death after traumatic injuries, including stroke, seizures, and mechanical trauma (51Lee J.M. Zipfel G.J. Choi D.W. Nature. 1999; 399: A7-A14Google Scholar, 52Dirnagl U. Iadecola C. Moskowitz M.A. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 391-397Google Scholar). Stimulation of cultured neurons with 100 μm glutamate and to higher glutamate concentrations mimics these pathological effects (14Sattler R. Xiong Z. Lu W.Y. Hafner M. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M. Science. 1999; 284: 1845-1848Google Scholar, 25Rameau G.A. Akaneya Y. Chiu L. Ziff E.B. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2255-2266Google Scholar, 53Dawson T.M. Steiner J.P. Dawson V.L. Dinerman J.L.

Brain Res. 1994; 100: 47-51Google Scholar, 56Sattler R. Charlton M.P. Hafner M. Tymianski M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2349-2364Google Scholar). A pathological dose of glutamate, 100 μm, induced the dephosphorylation of nNOS at Ser847 (Fig. 4A, lane 2) relative to the control (Fig. 4A, lane 1). Dephosphorylation of Ser847-PO4 by this excitotoxic dose of glutamate was blocked by either 30 μm MK801 (dizocilpine) or 10 nm OA, indicating a dependence of the dephosphorylation on NMDAR and PP1 activity (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). These results are consistent with our previous studies of a decrease in the overall level of nNOS phosphorylation after a pathological stimulation by glutamate involves PP1 (30Rameau G.A. Chiu L.Y. Ziff E.B. Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24: 1123-1133Google Scholar). Quantification of the data revealed that glutamate treatment at 100 μm for 60 min reduced the phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser847 up to 50% of its constitutive level (values represent means ± S.E., n = 4, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4B). We conclude that in contrast to the effects of physiological levels of glutamate, the activation of the NMDAR by a pathological concentration of glutamate leads to nNOS dephosphorylation at Ser847 via NMDAR regulation of phosphatase activity. Bidirectional Regulation of Phosphorylation at Ser847 by Glutamate—Stimulation of the NMDAR by low and high concentrations of glutamate resulted in a differential regulation of phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser847 dependent on the concentration of glutamate. To determine the concentration of glutamate at which dephosphorylation rather than phosphorylation is the outcome, we examined the levels of Ser847-PO4 nNOS after treatment of neurons with concentrations of glutamate increasing from 5 to 500 μm. In this experiment and all other experiments, we supplemented the medium with 20 μm glycine, a coagonist. This eliminated any ambiguity that varying glycine concentrations, rather than glutamate determined the transition point. Stimulation of cortical neurons with 5 and 50 μm glutamate increased phosphorylation of nNOS at Ser847 (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3) relative to the control (Fig. 5A, lane 1), whereas stimulation with 100-500 μm glutamate decreased phosphorylation (Fig. 5A, lanes 4-6). Treatment with 50 μm glutamate appears to be less stimulatory than with 5 μm glutamate, suggesting that the transition lies between 5 and 50 μm glutamate. Dephosphorylation was clearly manifested by treatment with 100 μm glutamate (Fig. 5A, lane 3). Analysis of Ser847-PO4 levels from several Western blots (Fig. 5B) confirmed that stimulation of the NMDAR by high glutamate dephosphorylated Ser847-PO4. Sequential Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation of Ser847—Activation of the NMDAR by low and high concentrations of glutamate induces increases and decreases, respectively, in nNOS phosphorylation which involve different signaling pathways. We therefore asked whether the increase in Ser847-PO4 nNOS induced by 5 μm glutamate could be reversed by subsequent treatment with 500 μm glutamate. Treatment with 500 μm glutamate was chosen instead of the 100 μm glutamate used in the previous experiments because this concentration showed a more robust dephosphorylation of nNOS at Ser847. We added 500 μm glutamate to cells that had been prestimulated with 5 μm glutamate for 30 min. Ser847-PO4 levels in these cells were compared wit"
https://openalex.org/W2052523909,"Various tumor-therapeutic drugs and environmental carcinogens alkylate DNA inducing O(6)-methylguanine (O(6)MeG) that provokes cell death by apoptosis. In rodent fibroblasts, apoptosis triggered by O(6)MeG is executed via the mitochondrial damage pathway. Conversion of O(6)MeG into critical downstream lesions requires mismatch repair (MMR). This is thought to signal apoptosis upon binding to O(6)MeG lesions mispaired with thymine. Alternatively, O(6)MeG lesions might be processed by MMR giving rise to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during replication that finally provoke apoptosis. To test this, we examined apoptosis triggered by O(6)MeG in human peripheral lymphocytes in which O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) had been inactivated by O(6)-benzylguanine (O(6)BG) and which were not proliferating or proliferating upon CD3/CD28 stimulation. Treatment with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) or the anticancer drug temozolomide induced apoptosis only in proliferating, but not resting cells. With exceptional high alkylation doses (>/=15 microM of MNNG), apoptosis was also observed in resting lymphocytes, albeit at a lower level than in proliferating cells. This response was not affected by O(6)BG, suggesting that replication-independent apoptosis at high dose levels is caused by lesions other than O(6)MeG. O(6)MeG-triggered apoptosis in proliferating lymphocytes was preceded by a wave of DSBs, which coincided with p53 and Fas receptor upregulation, while Fas ligand, Bax and Bcl-2 expression was not altered. Treatment with anti-Fas neutralizing antibody attenuated MNNG-induced apoptosis in MGMT-depleted proliferating lymphocytes. The data suggest that O(6)MeG is converted by MMR and DNA replication into DSBs that trigger apoptosis by p53 stabilization and Fas/CD95/Apo-1 upregulation. This is supported by the finding that ionizing radiation, inducing DSBs on its own, provokes apoptosis in lymphocytes in a replication-independent way. The strict proliferation dependence of apoptosis triggered by O(6)MeG may explain the specific killing response of MGMT-deficient proliferating cells, including tumors, to O(6)MeG generating anticancer drugs and suggests that tumor proliferation rate, Fas responsiveness, MGMT and MMR status are important prognosis parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2010849315,"Through a screen aimed at identifying genes that are specifically upregulated in embryomic stem (ES) cells but not primitive ectoderm, we identified cyclin D3. This was surprising since cyclin D activity is generally believed to be inactive in ES cells even though retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb) accumulates in a predominantly hyperphosphorylated state. Cdk6 is the major catalytic partner for cyclin D3 in ES cells and exhibits robust pRb kinase activity that is downregulated during the early stages of ES embryoid body differentiation. To investigate the basis underlying the insensitivity of ES cells to ectopic p16 expression, we show that Cdk6-cyclin D3 complexes are not subject to inhibition by p16, similar to Cdk-viral cyclin complexes. These observations show that specificity exists between Cdk4/6-cyclin D complexes and their ability to be targeted by p16. Our data suggest that Cdk6-cyclin D3 activity in other cell types, including tumors, may also be refractory to p16-mediated growth inhibition and raises the possibility of additional specificity within the INK4 family."
https://openalex.org/W2144165835,"Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step of glycerolipid synthesis. Two distinct GPAT isoenzymes had been identified in mammalian tissues, an N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-sensitive isoform in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (microsomal GPAT) and an NEM-resistant form in the outer mitochondrial membrane (mtGPAT). Although only mtGPAT has been cloned, the microsomal and mitochondrial GPAT isoforms can be distinguished, because they differ in acyl-CoA substrate preference, sensitivity to inhibition by dihydroxyacetone phosphate and polymixin B, temperature sensitivity, and ability to be activated by acetone. The preponderance of evidence supports a role for mtGPAT in synthesizing the precursors for triacylglycerol synthesis. In mtGPAT-/- mice, PCR genotyping and Northern analysis showed successful knockout of mtGPAT; however, we detected a novel NEM-sensitive GPAT activity in mitochondrial fractions and an anti-mtGPAT immunoreactive protein in liver mitochondria, but not in microsomes. Rigorous analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the anti-mtGPAT immunoreactive proteins in wild type and mtGPAT-/- liver mitochondria have different isoelectric points. These results suggested the presence of a second GPAT in liver mitochondria from mtGPAT-/- mice. Characterization of this GPAT activity in liver from mtGPAT null mice showed that, unlike the mtGPAT activity in wild type samples, activity in mtGPAT knockout mitochondria did not prefer palmitoyl-CoA, was sensitive to inactivation by NEM, was inhibited by dihydroxyacetone phosphate and polymixin B, was temperature-sensitive, and was not activated by acetone. We conclude that a novel GPAT (mtGPAT2) with antigenic epitopes similar to those of mtGPAT is detectable in mitochondria from the livers of mtGPAT-/- mice.

We conclude that a novel GPAT (mtGPAT2) with antigenic epitopes similar to those of mtGPAT is detectable in mitochondria from the livers of mtGPAT-/- mice. The initial and rate-limiting step of glycerolipid synthesis is the acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate with long-chain fatty acyl-CoA to form 1-acyl-glycerol 3-phosphate (LPA). 1The abbreviations used are: LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; G3P, glycerol 3-phosphate; GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; TAG, triacylglycerol; nt, nucleotides. 1The abbreviations used are: LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; G3P, glycerol 3-phosphate; GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; TAG, triacylglycerol; nt, nucleotides. This reaction is catalyzed by two glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT; EC 2.3.1.15) isoenzymes that are encoded by different genes (1Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Muoio D.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 77-103Google Scholar). One isoform is present in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (microsomal GPAT), and the other is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane (mtGPAT). Although the microsomal GPAT has not been cloned or purified, its activity is easily distinguished, because, unlike mtGPAT, the microsomal isoform is inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents (2Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Google Scholar). In most tissues, the microsomal GPAT activity is 10 times higher than that found in the mitochondrial fraction, but in liver, mtGPAT contributes 30–50% of the total activity (1Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Muoio D.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 77-103Google Scholar). Microsomal GPAT and mtGPAT also differ in their acyl-CoA substrate preference. The microsomal isoform esterifies both saturated and unsaturated long-chain acyl-CoAs equally well, but mtGPAT prefers C16:0-CoA (2Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Google Scholar). In rat liver, kidney, and heart, mtGPAT activity is 3–10-fold higher with C16:0-CoA than with other long-chain saturated or unsaturated acyl-CoA substrates (3Bremer J. Bjerve K.S. Borrebaek B. Christiansen R. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1976; 12: 113-125Google Scholar, 4Haldar D. Tso W.-W. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4502-4509Google Scholar, 5Monroy G. Rola F.H. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6884-6894Google Scholar, 6Monroy G. Kelker H.C. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2845-2852Google Scholar). The activity of recombinant mouse mtGPAT purified from an insect cell expression system is 2-fold higher with C16:0-CoA than with C18:1-, C18:2n6-, C18:3n3-, or C20: 4n6-CoA (7Yet S.-F. Moon Y.K. Sul H.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7303-7310Google Scholar). Because most naturally occurring glycerolipids contain saturated fatty acids at the sn-1 position and unsaturated fatty acids at the sn-2 position, it was proposed that mtGPAT establishes the initial asymmetric distribution of fatty acids (4Haldar D. Tso W.-W. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4502-4509Google Scholar). This hypothesis was borne out by studies with GPAT-/- mice showing that, compared with the wild-type mice, their liver phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine have 20% less palmitate in the sn-1 position and 36–40% more arachidonate in the sn-2 position (8Hammond L.E. Gallagher P.A. Wang S. Hiller S. Kluckman K.D. Posey-Marcos E.L. Maeda N. Coleman R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8204-8214Google Scholar). These results confirm both the important role mtGPAT plays in the positioning of 16:0 at the sn-1 position of phospholipids and its indirect role in positioning 20:4 at the sn-2 position. Although the microsomal GPAT is present in the same subcellular membrane fraction as the terminal enzymes for TAG synthesis, physiological data suggest that TAG formation is regulated by the mitochondrial isoform (1Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Muoio D.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 77-103Google Scholar, 8Hammond L.E. Gallagher P.A. Wang S. Hiller S. Kluckman K.D. Posey-Marcos E.L. Maeda N. Coleman R.A. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42205-42212Google Scholar). Because only the mitochondrial GPAT isoform has been cloned (11Yet S.-F. Lee S. Hahm Y.T. Sul H.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9486-9491Google Scholar, 12Bhat B.G. Wang P. Kim J.-H. Black T.M. Lewin T.M. Fiedorek T.F. Coleman R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 415-423Google Scholar), changes in activity of the two isoenzymes can be compared, but not changes in mRNA abundance or protein expression. In general, mtGPAT mRNA, protein, and activity in liver and adipose tissue increase with carbohydrate feeding and with insulin stimulation, whereas microsomal GPAT activity does not change (11Yet S.-F. Lee S. Hahm Y.T. Sul H.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9486-9491Google Scholar, 13Saggerson E.D. Carpenter C.A. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 289-292Google Scholar, 14Shin D.-H. Paulauskis J.D. Moustaid N.

In addition, mtGPAT mRNA is upregulated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, a potent activator of lipogenesis (16Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7298-7305Google Scholar). The role for mtGPAT in up-regulating TAG synthesis is also supported by studies of overexpressed rat mtGPAT in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Expression of recombinant rat mtGPAT in Chinese hamster ovary cells results in a 3.8-fold increase in NEM-resistant GPAT activity, a 4-fold increase in [14C]oleate incorporation into TAG, and a 30% decrease in [14C]oleate incorporation into phospholipids (10Igal R.A. Wang S. Gonzales-Baro M. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42205-42212Google Scholar). To confirm the critical role of mtGPAT in the regulation of TAG synthesis, mtGPAT null mice were generated (8Hammond L.E. Gallagher P.A. Wang S. Hiller S. Kluckman K.D. Posey-Marcos E.L. Maeda N. Coleman R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8204-8214Google Scholar). The knockout mice weigh less than controls and have reduced gonadal fat pad weights, lower hepatic TAG content, a lower plasma TAG and very low density lipoprotein TAG, and decreased secretion of TAG from liver (8Hammond L.E. Gallagher P.A. Wang S. Hiller S. Kluckman K.D. Posey-Marcos E.L. Maeda N. Coleman R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8204-8214Google Scholar). These data suggest that mtGPAT is required for normal synthesis of TAG in both fat cells and hepatocytes but show that the microsomal GPAT also contributes. We were surprised to find that mitochondria isolated from liver of mtGPAT-/- retained considerable GPAT activity but that this activity, unlike that of mtGPAT, was inactivated by NEM. Further, an anti-GPAT immunoblot analysis of GPAT-/- liver mitochondria detected an immunoreactive protein with approximately the same molecular mass as mtGPAT. Rigorous analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the anti-mtGPAT immunoreactive proteins in wild type and mtGPAT-/- liver mitochondria had different isoelectric points. These results suggested the presence of a second mtGPAT isoform. Further characterization showed that, unlike the mtGPAT activity in wild type samples, the NEM-sensitive GPAT activity in mitochondria from liver of knockout animals did not prefer C16:0-CoA, was inhibited by DHAP and polymixin B, was temperature-sensitive, and was not activated by acetone. We conclude that liver mitochondria from mtGPAT-/- mice express a novel GPAT activity. Chemicals—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma if not otherwise indicated. [2-3H]Glycerol was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Lipid standards were from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratories. Animals—Animal protocols were approved by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male mtGPAT-/- and wild type mice were genotyped by PCR as described previously (8Hammond L.E. Gallagher P.A. Wang S. Hiller S. Kluckman K.D. Posey-Marcos E.L. Maeda N. Coleman R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8204-8214Google Scholar). Mice were housed on a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle with free access to water and Prolab RMH 3000 SP76 chow. Preparation of Mouse Liver Mitochondrial and Microsomal Fractions—Two-month-old male mtGPAT deficient mice and male wild type mice were anesthetized with Avertin (0.01 ml/g of body weight) and killed by cervical dislocation. Liver was removed immediately, minced, and placed in Medium 1 + DTT (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). Tissue was homogenized with 10 up and down strokes in a Teflon-glass homogenizing vessel and centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min to remove large debris and nuclei. Mitochondria were obtained by centrifuging the supernatant at 10,300 × g for 10 min. The microsomal fraction was acquired by centrifuging the supernatant for 1 h at 100,000 × g. Liver mitochondrial and microsomal fractions were stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Purity of the Mitochondrial and Microsomal Fractions—Purity of the liver subcellular fractions was established by measuring the activity of marker enzymes, NADH cytochrome c reductase (17Dallner G. Seikevitz P. Palade G. J. Cell Biol. 1966; 30: 97-117Google Scholar), and cytochrome c oxidase (cytochrome c oxidase kit; Sigma), for endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, respectively. Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 1% SDS, transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and incubated with antibody against recombinant rat mtGPAT expressed in bacteria and gel-purified from inclusion bodies. For chemiluminescent detection, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by incubating the membrane with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and PicoWest reagents (Pierce). For two-dimensional analyses, mitochondria (1 mg of protein) were added to 600 μl of rehydration buffer containing 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 0.5% (v/v) Biolytes 3–10 (Bio-Rad), 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% ASB-14 (Calbiochem) and 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm tributyl phosphine. The sample was mixed and sonicated in a water bath sonicator for 5 min. The sample was incubated for an additional 40 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 13,000 × g to pellet the insoluble particulate. Immobilized pH gradient gel strips (Bio-Rad) were rehydrated overnight (12–16 h) at 50 V with rehydration buffer containing the protein sample. Proteins were separated on a protein isoelectric focusing cell (Bio-Rad) for 60,000 V-h. The immobilized pH gradient gel strip was conditioned for 15 min with 250 V, and then the voltage was raised to 30,000 V over 3 h. After isoelectric focusing, the immobilized pH gradient gel strips were incubated for 10 min with shaking in equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.15 m Tris-HCl) containing 130 mm DTT and subsequently in rehydration buffer containing 135 mm iodoacetamide for an additional 10 min with shaking. The immobilized pH gradient gel strips were placed on an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 1% SDS to separate proteins in the second dimension. Immunoblotting was performed as described above. Glycerol 3-Phosphate Synthesis and GPAT Assay—sn-[2-3H]Glycerol 3-phosphate was synthesized enzymatically from [2-3H]glycerol (1 mCi/ml), purified, and assayed as described (18Chang Y.-Y. Kennedy E.P. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 447-455Google Scholar). GPAT activity was assayed in a 200-μl mixture containing 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum (essentially fatty acid-free), 1 mm DTT, 8 mm NaF, 800 μm [3H]glycerol 3-phosphate, and 80 μm palmitoyl-CoA (19Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 450-465Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by adding 15–30 μg of mitochondrial or microsomal protein to the assay mix. All assays were performed for 10 min at room temperature unless indicated. Assay modifications are indicated in the figures. All experiments were performed at least twice. Lipid Analysis—Products from the GPAT assay were pooled, dried, and resuspended in chloroform. The lipids were spotted on a Silica G plate (Whatman) together with standards for LPA, phosphatidic acid, and diacylglycerol. The chromatograms were developed in CHCl3/pyridine/formic acid (88%) (50:30:7). The plates were exposed to iodine vapor, and the bands corresponding to LPA, phosphatidic acid, and diacylglycerol were scraped into scintillation vials containing Cyoscint (ICN) for scintillation counting. Mitochondrial GPAT-/- Liver Mitochondria Contain an NEM-sensitive GPAT Activity—Mitochondrial GPAT (mtGPAT) knockout mice were generated by replacing a 0.5-kb genomic sequence encoding part of the active site with neo and confirmed by PCR genotyping (8Hammond L.E. Gallagher P.A. Wang S. Hiller S. Kluckman K.D. Posey-Marcos E.L. Maeda N. Coleman R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8204-8214Google Scholar). To make certain that we had truly eliminated mtGPAT in the knockout mouse, we probed RNA from mtGPAT +/+, +/-, and -/- mice with two probes for rat mtGPAT, Probe A (nt 785–1582, 0.8 kb) and Probe B (nt 1583–2194, 0.6 kb). The active site of mtGPAT is composed of homology regions I (nt 679–717), II (nt 814–834), III (nt 934–969), and IV (nt 1039–1062) (20Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Google Scholar). Regions II–IV are contained within Probe A. The targeting construct deletes a 0.5-kb region of genomic DNA that contains homology regions II and III. Neither Probe A nor Probe B, which together encode 53% of the open reading frame, identified an RNA band in liver from mtGPAT-/- mice (8Hammond L.E. Gallagher P.A. Wang S. Hiller S. Kluckman K.D. Posey-Marcos E.L. Maeda N. Coleman R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8204-8214Google Scholar). These previously published Northern analyses demonstrate that mtGPAT-/- mice lack expression of the mtGPAT transcript. Therefore, we were surprised to find that the mitochondria of mtGPAT-/- mice contained a GPAT activity that was sensitive to NEM inhibition. Thus, we undertook a careful study of the novel GPAT activity in highly pure mitochondrial fractions (Table I) from livers of wild type and mtGPAT null mice. Historically, the GPAT activity in mitochondria has been measured as NEM-resistant glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity, because sulfhydryl reagents only inhibit the GPAT activity present in microsomes (2Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Google Scholar). In our initial characterization of the mtGPAT null mice, we assayed liver total membrane fractions in the presence and absence of NEM. In these total membrane fractions, GPAT activity in the presence of NEM was only 8% of the NEM-resistant activity observed in wild type mice (8Hammond L.E. Gallagher P.A. Wang S. Hiller S. Kluckman K.D. Posey-Marcos E.L. Maeda N. Coleman R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8204-8214Google Scholar), consistent with the amount of residual microsomal GPAT activity that is usually observed after NEM treatment (21Schlossman D.M. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5738-5744Google Scholar, 22Schlossman D.M. Bell R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 182: 732-742Google Scholar). The NEM-sensitive GPAT activities were similar in wild type and mtGPAT knockout mice. Highly purified mitochondria from mtGPAT-/- mice, however, contained substantial GPAT activity that was 60% of the activity present in mitochondria from wild type mice (1.0 nmol/min/mg) (Fig. 1A). When the labeled glycerolipid products formed in the assays for GPAT activity in mitochondria were analyzed by TLC, a similar distribution of LPA, phosphatidic acid, and diacylglycerol was observed in samples from wild type and mtGPAT null mice (Fig. 1B). We reasoned that the GPAT activity still present in mitochondria from the knockout must be an NEM-sensitive enzyme. To confirm this hypothesis, liver mitochondria from wild type and mtGPAT null mice were assayed for GPAT activity with increasing concentrations of NEM (Fig. 2). GPAT activity in wild type mitochondria was stable in the presence of 0.4 mm NEM as previously reported (2Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Google Scholar); however, as little as 0.05 mm NEM inhibited 75% of activity in mitochondria from mtGPAT-/- mice. These data clearly distinguish GPAT activity in wild type and knockout animals and show that the GPAT activity in liver mitochondria from mtGPAT null mice is NEM-sensitive, similar to the microsomal GPAT (Table II).Table IActivities of ER and mitochondrial marker enzymesNADPH cytochrome c reductaseNADPH cytochrome c oxidaseTotal activityaTotal activity in each fractionPercentagebPercentage of total activity in all fractionsTotal activityaTotal activity in each fractionPercentagebPercentage of total activity in all fractionsmol/min%mol/min%Mitochondria +/+0.033.614.6994.2 —/—0.052.015.3398.3Microsomes +/+0.7096.40.905.8 —/—2.598.01.721.7a Total activity in each fractionb Percentage of total activity in all fractions Open table in a new tab Fig. 2GPAT activity in mtGPAT-/- liver mitochondria is NEM-sensitive. GPAT-specific activity was determined in liver mitochondria from wild type (•) and mtGPAT knockout (○) mice. Samples were preincubated on ice at the indicated NEM concentrations for 15 min. The GPAT assay was performed at room temperature with 20 μg of protein. Each value represents the average of two determinations. GPAT-specific activities at 0 mm NEM (100%) were 0.80 nmol/min/mg for wild type and 0.50 nmol/min/mg for mtGPAT knockout liver mitochondria.

All values represent the average of duplicates from a representative experiment repeated at least twice.

The mitochondria were not contaminated with endoplasmic reticulum (Table I), and no immunoreactive protein was detected in the microsome fraction (Fig. 3A), consistent with previous reports that the microsomal and mitochondrial GPAT isoforms are distinct (1Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Muoio D.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 77-103Google Scholar, 2Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Google Scholar, 11Yet S.-F. Lee S. Hahm Y.T. Sul H.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9486-9491Google Scholar) and that their amino acid sequences are very different. A two-dimensional Western blot analysis was performed in order to distinguish the anti-GPAT immunoreactive proteins in wild type and mtGPAT-/- liver mitochondria. The immunoreactive protein detected in mtGPAT knockout mouse liver had a different isoelectric point than the protein detected in wild type mice (Fig. 3B). In the upper panel, two major bands (labeled 1 and 2) and several minor bands were detected in a mixed sample of liver mitochondria from wild type and mtGPAT null mice. In samples containing liver mitochondria from mtGPAT-/- mice (lower panel), band 1 (presumably mtGPAT) is absent, whereas band 2 remains. Since the antibody used was raised against full-length recombinant rat mtGPAT protein, we suspected that the novel immunoreactive protein was a novel GPAT isoenzyme with considerable amino acid sequence similarity to mtGPAT. Kinetic Characterization of GPAT Activity in GPAT-/- Liver Mitochondria—The NEM sensitivity of GPAT activity in knockout liver mitochondria indicated the presence of a new GPAT isoenzyme. To further characterize this isoenzyme, we determined the Km for the two substrates, glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) and acyl-CoA. The apparent Km for G3P in wild type mitochondria was 400 μm (Fig. 4A) and in the same range (670 μm) as previous studies of purified recombinant mouse mtGPAT (7Yet S.-F. Moon Y.K. Sul H.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7303-7310Google Scholar). The apparent Km for G3P in mitochondria from the mtGPAT null mice was similar (300 μm). Microsomal GPAT had an apparent Km for G3P of 140 μm (Fig. 4B). Palmitoyl-CoA is the preferred substrate for mtGPAT (2Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Google Scholar); unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA species, like oleoyl-CoA, give a maximum velocity that is 2–9-fold lower (3Bremer J. Bjerve K.S. Borrebaek B. Christiansen R. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1976; 12: 113-125Google Scholar, 4Haldar D. Tso W.-W. Pullman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4502-4509Google Scholar, 5Monroy G. Rola F.H. Pullman M.E. J. Biol.

The only comparative study of mouse mtGPAT showed that recombinant enzyme purified from insect cells had a 2-fold preference for C16:0-CoA compared with C18:1 at 25 μm (7Yet S.-F. Moon Y.K. Sul H.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7303-7310Google Scholar). In mtGPAT-/- liver mitochondria, no difference in apparent Vmax was observed between C18:1- and C16:0-CoA substrates, but wild type liver mitochondria showed a 30% preference for C16:0-CoA as compared with C18:1-CoA at 75 μm (Fig. 4C). In wild type and mtGPAT-/- mice, the apparent Km values for C16:0- and C18: 1-CoA could not be calculated because of inhibition at concentrations higher than 75 μm. The lack of a preference for C16:0-CoA for activity from mtGPAT null mitochondria closely resembles that of the microsomal GPAT isoenzyme (2Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Google Scholar). Because the microsomal GPAT from rat fat cells and liver also acylates DHAP, which acts as a competitive inhibitor (19Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 450-465Google Scholar, 21Schlossman D.M. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5738-5744Google Scholar), we measured the ability of DHAP to inhibit GPAT activity. Increasing concentrations of DHAP inhibited [3H]G3P acylation in mitochondria from mtGPAT-/- liver but not in wild type (Fig. 5A). The Ki for DHAP was calculated to be 545 μm (Fig. 5B), similar to previous reports for rat microsomal GPAT (19Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 450-465Google Scholar, 23Coleman R.A. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7681-7687Google Scholar). Mouse liver microsomal GPAT activity was not inhibited by DHAP at 1.75 mm when 800 μm [3H]G3P was present in the assay (Fig. 5A), but at 200 μm [3H]G3P, both mouse and rat liver microsomal GPAT were inhibited 30% (data not shown), similar to previous assays that used lower G3P concentrations (19Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 450-465Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that DHAP is a competitive inhibitor of the novel GPAT activity present in knockout liver mitochondria. The susceptibility to inhibition by DHAP is similar to microsomal GPAT, whereas in wild type mitochondria, DHAP does not inhibit mtGPAT activity. GPAT Activity in mtGPAT-/- Liver Mitochondria Is Temperature-sensitive, Inhibited by Polymixin B, and Unresponsive to Acetone Activation—Microsomal and mtGPAT activities are differently affected by temperature, polymixin B, acetone, salts, and chelators (2Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Google Scholar), so we examined the effects of these on mitochondrial GPAT activities from wild type and GPAT-/- liver mitochondria (Table II). GPAT activities in microsomes, wild type mitochondria, and knockout mitochondria were maximal under similar assay conditions (pH 7–7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mm NaF, and 1 mm DTT). The addition of monovalent salts (NaCl, KCl) and chelators (EDTA, EGTA) did not differently affect GPAT activities. Malonyl-CoA, a potent inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, did not inhibit or activate GPAT activity in wild type or knockout mitochondria. LPA, the product of the GPAT reaction, inhibits GPAT activity equally well in mitochondria from wild type and mtGPAT-/- mice, similar to previous reports (24Coleman R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 367-374Google Scholar). Since microsomal GPAT activity is inhibited 50%"

In this study, we used the acylphosphatase from the hyperthermophilic Archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus (Sso AcP) to investigate the mechanism of aggregation under conditions in which the protein maintains a folded structure. In the presence of 15-25% (v/v) trifluoroethanol, Sso AcP was found to form aggregates able to bind specific dyes such as thioflavine T, Congo red, and 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid. The presence of aggregates was confirmed by circular dichroism and dynamic light scattering. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of small aggregates generally referred to as amyloid protofibrils. The monomeric form adopted by Sso AcP prior to aggregation under these conditions retained enzymatic activity; in addition, folding was remarkably faster than unfolding. These observations indicate that Sso AcP adopts a folded, although possibly distorted, conformation prior to aggregation. Most important, aggregation appeared to be 100-fold faster than unfolding under these conditions. Although aggregation of Sso AcP was faster at higher trifluoroethanol concentrations, in which the protein adopted a partially unfolded conformation, these findings suggest that the early events of amyloid fibril formation may involve an aggregation process consisting of the assembly of protein molecules in their folded state. This conclusion has a biological relevance as globular proteins normally spend most of their lifetime in folded structures.

This conclusion has a biological relevance as globular proteins normally spend most of their lifetime in folded structures. Protein aggregation is a hallmark of a number of human pathologies including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases and the systemic amyloidoses associated with immunoglobulin light chain, transthyretin, lysozyme, and β2-microglobulin (1Stefani M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Google Scholar). Under these pathological conditions, a protein or peptide that is normally soluble deposits into fibrillar aggregates commonly referred to as amyloid fibrils; these display a diameter of 7-13 nm, an extensive β-sheet structure, and characteristic staining properties such as a Congo red birefringence under cross-polarized light (2Sunde M. Blake C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 123-159Google Scholar). It has long been recognized that the conformational state of a polypeptide chain that forms the precursor aggregates, eventually leading to amyloid formation, is neither the natively folded nor the fully unfolded state but a partially folded state that contains significant structure, although lacking a well defined tertiary fold (3Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Google Scholar, 4Rochet J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 60-68Google Scholar). For the majority of the proteins that have been studied in detail, it is clear that this is the case. Fibril formation from transthyretin, for example, occurs preferentially at mildly acidic pH values (5Lai Z. Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6470-6482Google Scholar). Under these conditions the native tetrameric conformation of the protein is found to dissociate and to partially unfold, thus adopting a conformation that is highly prone to aggregate and to form amyloid fibrils (5Lai Z. Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6470-6482Google Scholar). Similarly, β2-microglobulin forms amyloid fibrils under conditions in which the N- and C-terminal β-strands of the protein are unfolded (6McParland V.J. Kalverda A.P. Homans S.W. Radford S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 326-331Google Scholar). Observations that these regions of the sequence are solvent-exposed in the fibrils formed from this protein provide direct evidence that fibril formation does not originate from the assembly of protein molecules in their native conformation (7Hoshino M. Katou H. Hagihara Y. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 332-336Google Scholar). Some other proteins such as cystatin C, which is associated with a hereditary form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and the cell cycle regulatory protein p13suc1 are suggested to fibrillize via domain swapping (8Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5596-5601Google Scholar, 9Staniforth R.A. Giannini S. Higgins L.D. Conroy M.J. Hounslow A.M. Jerala R. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4774-4781Google Scholar). Domain swapping is a mechanism in which part of the structure of each monomer replaces the corresponding structural elements of an identical monomer so as to form an oligomer where each subunit has a similar structure to the folded monomer (8Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5596-5601Google Scholar, 9Staniforth R.A. Giannini S. Higgins L.D. Conroy M.J. Hounslow A.M. Jerala R. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4774-4781Google Scholar). Even in this case, aggregation is proposed to require a substantial unfolding of the folded monomer in order to facilitate exchange of structural elements (8Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5596-5601Google Scholar, 9Staniforth R.A. Giannini S. Higgins L.D. Conroy M.J. Hounslow A.M. Jerala R. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4774-4781Google Scholar). The presence of structure in the fibrils formed from the amyloid β peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease indicates that fibrils formed from peptides or proteins that are unstructured in their soluble form need to adopt a partially structured conformation either before or during assembly (10Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutkin O.N. Leapman R.D. Delaglio F. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16742-16747Google Scholar, 11Torok M. Milton S. Kayed R. Wu P. McIntire T. Glabe C.G. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40810-40815Google Scholar). These are just a few examples that support the “conformational change hypothesis” of fibril formation. Nevertheless, the general validity of these theories has been challenged by a number of recent findings. On the one hand, amyloid formation may occur readily from peptides as short as 5 residues, where formation of structure before assembly is rather unlikely given the short length of the peptides (12Lopez de La Paz M. Goldie K. Zurdo J. Lacroix E. Dobson C.M. Hoenger A. Serrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16052-16057Google Scholar). On the other hand, a number of observations have indicated that fibrillar aggregates may originate from the assembly of globular protein molecules in their native or native-like state (13Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 17: 2903-2911Google Scholar, 14Laurine E. Gregoire C. Fandrich M. Engemann S. Marchal S. Thion L. Mohr M. Monsarrat B. Michel B. Dobson C.M. Wanker E. Erard M. Verdier J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51770-51778Google Scholar). The yeast prion Ure2p was shown to form fibrils that display birefringence upon Congo red binding and increased resistance to proteinase K treatment, typical of amyloid fibrils (15Taylor K.L. Cheng N. Williams R.W. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1339-1343Google Scholar, 16Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Google Scholar, 17Thual C. Bousset L. Komar A.A. Walter S. Buchner J. Cullin C. Melki R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1764-1773Google Scholar). It was shown that Ure2p retains its native α-helical content and ability to bind glutathione after assembly into fibrils (13Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 17: 2903-2911Google Scholar). Accordingly, x-ray fiber diffraction analysis has shown that the fibrils do not possess a cross-β-structure (18Bousset L. Briki F. Doucet J. Melki R. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 141: 132-142Google Scholar). Similarly, lithostathine, a protein that forms both independent and colocalized deposits with amyloid β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and PrPsc plaques, maintains its native content of secondary structure, although it aggregates into fibrillar structures (14Laurine E. Gregoire C. Fandrich M. Engemann S. Marchal S. Thion L. Mohr M. Monsarrat B. Michel B. Dobson C.M. Wanker E. Erard M. Verdier J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51770-51778Google Scholar). In this case the resulting proteinase K-resistant fibrils do not bind Congo red in addition to showing no cross-β-structure (14Laurine E. Gregoire C. Fandrich M. Engemann S. Marchal S. Thion L. Mohr M. Monsarrat B. Michel B. Dobson C.M. Wanker E. Erard M. Verdier J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51770-51778Google Scholar). The ability of these two proteins to form fibrillar structures under non-denaturing conditions close to a physiological medium suggests that a substantial unfolding is not required (13Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 17: 2903-2911Google Scholar, 14Laurine E. Gregoire C. Fandrich M. Engemann S. Marchal S. Thion L. Mohr M. Monsarrat B. Michel B. Dobson C.M. Wanker E. Erard M. Verdier J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51770-51778Google Scholar). Amyloid formation is a property that is not only shared by a few polypeptide chains associated with disease. Following the initial observation that the Src homology 3 domain from phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is able to form fibrillar aggregates structurally indistinguishable from those formed naturally under pathological conditions (19Guijarro J.I. Sunde M. Jones J.A. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4224-4228Google Scholar), ∼20 proteins were shown to have the potential to form amyloid fibrils under appropriate conditions in vitro (1Stefani M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Google Scholar). In addition to a rise in general awareness that protein sequences, and more generally the biology of cells, have evolved structural adaptations and biological mechanisms to effectively defend from undesired protein aggregation, these findings have provided new model systems to investigate the fundamentals of protein aggregation (1Stefani M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Google Scholar). Amyloid formation from these non-pathological systems occurs under mild denaturing conditions, such as at low pH values, at high temperatures and in the presence of organic cosolvents. Moreover, mutations that destabilize the native conformation of a protein increase its propensity to aggregate (20Chiti F. Taddei N. Bucciantini M. White P. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1441-1449Google Scholar, 21Ramirez-Alvarado M. Merkel J.S. Regan L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8979-8984Google Scholar). These observations support further the view that substantial unfolding of the compact globular state of a protein is generally the first conformational change that initiates aggregation. In this study, we show that aggregation of one of these non-pathological proteins may result from a conformational state that presents only minor structural modifications compared with the native form of the protein. The protein that we have used is the acylphosphatase from the hyperthermophile Archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus (Sso AcP). 1The abbreviations used are: Sso AcP, S. solfataricus acylphosphatase; ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid; DLS, dynamic light scattering; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; TFE, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol; ThT, thioflavine T. 1The abbreviations used are: Sso AcP, S. solfataricus acylphosphatase; ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid; DLS, dynamic light scattering; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; TFE, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol; ThT, thioflavine T. A stable protein from a hyperthermophilic organism is likely to maintain its native topology under a wide range of conditions, including relatively harsh solvent conditions that normally promote aggregation. Utilization of a hyperthermophilic protein therefore allows aggregation processes to be investigated under conditions in which the native conformation is not significantly disrupted. Although the native structure of Sso AcP has not yet been resolved, the relatively high sequence identity with the previously characterized human muscle and common-type acylphosphatases and the N-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli HypF suggests it may display the same basic ferredoxin-like topology, consisting of a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet facing two antiparallel α-helices (22Pastore A. Saudek V. Ramponi G. Williams R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 427-440Google Scholar, 23Thunnissen M.M. Taddei N. Liguri G. Ramponi G. Nordlund P. Structure. 1997; 5: 69-79Google Scholar, 24Rosano C. Zuccotti S. Bucciantini M. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 785-796Google Scholar). In addition to illustrating the capability of this protein to form ordered aggregates, we will present kinetic evidence that aggregation originates from a conformational state that retains enzymatic activity and is located on the native side of the major free energy barrier of unfolding. Materials—Thioflavine T (ThT), Congo red, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS), guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) were purchased from Sigma. Benzoyl phosphate was synthesized and purified as described (25Camici G. Manao G. Cappugi G. Ramponi G. Experientia (Basel). 1976; 32: 535-536Google Scholar). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Sso AcP—The DNA fragment corresponding to the Sso AcP gene, originally inserted in a pEMBL plasmid, was amplified by PCR using two primers that contained the restriction sites for BamHI and EcoRI. The resulting amplified fragments were purified using the QiaQuick Purification Kit by Qiagen (Milano, Italy), digested with BamHI and EcoRI for 2 h, purified again, and then ligated into pGEX-2T plasmid, previously digested with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid was checked by DNA sequencing and then transformed into E. coli DH5α cells. Gene expression in the DH5α cells and purification of the resulting protein were carried out as described for human muscle acylphosphatase (26Taddei N. Stefani M. Magherini F. Chiti F. Modesti A. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7077-7083Google Scholar). Protein purity was checked by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry. The resulting protein sequence is GSMKKWSDTEVFEMLKRMYARVYGLVQGVGFRKFVQIHAIRLGIKGYAKNLPDGSVEVVAEGYEEALSKLLERIKQGPPAAEVEKVDYSFSEYKGEFEDFETY. The Gly-Ser dipeptide at the N terminus results from the cloning in pGEX-2T. The underlined Met residue is residue 1. Purified protein was stored in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Protein concentration was determined by UV absorption using an ϵ280 value of 1.26 ml mg-1 cm-1. Thioflavine T Assay—Sso AcP was incubated at a concentration of 0.4 mg ml-1 for 2 h in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 25 °C in the presence of various concentrations of TFE. 60 μl of each sample were added to 440 μl of a solution containing 25 μm ThT, 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. The fluorescence of the resulting samples was measured at 25 °C using a 2 × 10-mm path length cuvette and a PerkinElmer LS 55 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a thermostated cell compartment. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 440 and 485 nm, respectively. The kinetics of aggregation of Sso AcP were studied by incubating the protein under the same conditions of pH and temperature in 15, 20, 25, 50, and 70% of TFE (v/v). Aliquots were withdrawn at regular time intervals and used for the ThT assay as described above. In order to determine the rate constants of aggregation (k), the plots of the fluorescence intensity versus time were fit to single exponential functions of the form y = q + A exp(-kt). Congo Red Assay—Sso AcP was incubated at a concentration of 0.4 mg ml-1 for 30 min in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 25 °C in the presence of 0, 20, 50, or 70% (v/v) TFE. Aliquots of 60 μl of each protein solution were mixed with 440 μl of solutions containing 20 μm Congo red, 5 mm phosphate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. After a 2-3-min equilibration, optical absorption spectra were acquired from 400 to 700 nm by an Ultrospec 2000 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). A 4 × 5-mm path length cuvette was used. Solutions without protein and solutions without Congo red were used as controls. ANS Assay—Sso AcP was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C as described above for the ThT assay. Aliquots of 60 μl of the protein solutions were mixed with 440 μl of solutions containing 1 mm ANS, in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 25 °C. Fluorescence spectra were acquired using the PerkinElmer LS 55 spectrofluorimeter, an excitation wavelength of 390 nm, and an emission range from 410 to 620 nm. A 2 × 10-mm path length cell was used. Dynamic Light Scattering—Sso AcP was incubated for 30 min as described above for the ThT assay. Size distributions of the protein samples by intensity were obtained before and after centrifugation of the samples (18,000 rpm for 10 min). The data were attained using a Zetasizer Nano S dynamic light scattering (DLS) device from Malvern Instruments (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). The temperature was maintained at 25 °C by a thermostating system. Low volume 12.5 × 45-mm disposable cells were used. The buffer was filtered immediately before use to eliminate any impurities. Far-UV Circular Dichroism—Sso AcP was incubated for 30 min as described above for the ThT assay. Far-UV CD spectra were acquired at 25 °C using a cuvette of 1-mm path length and a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Great Dunmow, Essex, UK) equipped with a thermostated cell holder. Each spectrum was recorded as the average of three scans. The first set of spectra for the samples was acquired after an incubation of 30 min at 25 °C. A second set of spectra was acquired after centrifugation of the samples at 18,000 rpm for 10 min. In the kinetic experiment the far-UV ellipticity at 222 nm was monitored for Sso AcP at 0.4 mg ml-1 in 20% (v/v) TFE at 25 °C for 1 h. Electron Microscopy—Electron micrographs were acquired by a Joel JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) at 80-kV excitation voltage. The samples consisted of 0.4 mg ml-1 Sso AcP incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, in the absence or presence of 20% (v/v) TFE. 3 μl of the sample were placed on a Formvar and carbon-coated grid from Agar Scientific (Stansted, Essex, UK) for 3-5 min and then blotted off. 3 μl of 2% uranyl acetate were then added, remained on the grid for 3 min, and blotted off. The magnification was 20,000-30,000 times. Enzymatic Activity Measurements—Sso AcP was incubated at a concentration of 0.03 mg ml-1 for 30 min in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 25 °C. Incubation was carried out as follows: (i) in the presence of various concentrations of TFE, (ii) in the absence of TFE, and (iii) in the presence of 6 m GdnHCl. After pre-incubation, enzymatic activity was measured spectrophotometrically using benzoyl phosphate as a substrate (25Camici G. Manao G. Cappugi G. Ramponi G. Experientia (Basel). 1976; 32: 535-536Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of the protein sample were mixed with 950 μl of a solution containing 2.5 mm benzoyl phosphate, 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, and various TFE concentrations. Final protein concentration was 0.0015 mg ml-1. For the first set of experiments (i) the protein sample was pre-incubated in the same TFE concentration that was used afterward for the enzymatic activity assay. All recorded enzymatic activity values were subtracted by the spontaneous, non-catalyzed hydrolysis of benzoyl phosphate measured under the same conditions. Stopped-flow Kinetics—Folding and unfolding of Sso AcP were followed with a Bio-logic SFM-3 stopped-flow device coupled to a fluorescence detection system (Claix, France) and thermostated with a water-circulating bath. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the emitted fluorescence above 320 nm was monitored using a bandpass filter. For the unfolding experiments, 1 volume of 0.4 mg ml-1 Sso AcP in buffer was mixed with 19 volumes of a solution containing TFE. Folding was initiated by mixing 1 volume of 0.4 mg ml-1 Sso AcP denatured in 6 m GdnHCl with 19 volumes of a solution without GdnHCl and containing low concentrations of TFE. The final conditions were 0.02 mg ml-1 Sso AcP, 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 25 °C, and the final TFE concentration range was from 45 to 60% (v/v) (for unfolding) or from 0 to 18% (v/v) (for folding). The dead time was generally 10.4 ms. The kinetic traces were fitted to simple exponential functions of the form shown in Equation 1, y(t)=at+b+Aexp(-kt)(Eq. 1) where y(t) is the fluorescence signal recorded as a function of time; A and k are the amplitude and rate constant, respectively. The additional straight line a t + b was considered to account for trends of the fluorescence signal arising due to aggregation, proline isomerization, fluorescence decay of the sample, and other disturbing factors. Aggregation of Sso AcP was promoted by adding TFE. In addition to be a cosolvent commonly used to promote amyloid formation (20Chiti F. Taddei N. Bucciantini M. White P. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1441-1449Google Scholar, 27Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Massimo S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 17701-17709Google Scholar), TFE has also proven useful for revealing details of the mechanism of protein aggregation (29Barrow C.J. Zagorski M.G. Science. 1991; 253: 179-182Google Scholar, 30Fezoui Y. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36948-36954Google Scholar, 31Chiti F. Stefani M. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 424: 805-808Google Scholar). For the study of aggregation of Sso AcP, we focused on the first aggregational events, i.e. the conversion of the soluble form into pre-fibrillar aggregates. Indeed, several studies suggest that these pre-fibrillar structures may be the key oligomeric species that are toxic to the cells and responsible for the onset of neurodegenerative diseases (27Bucciantini M.

Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Wolfe M.S. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Google Scholar). Aggregate Formation Monitored by Dye Binding—Sso AcP was incubated for 2 h at 25 °C, pH 5.5, in various TFE concentrations. The samples were then subjected to the ThT assay so as to reveal the presence of aggregates with a relatively ordered organization (35LeVine III, H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Google Scholar). Although the samples incubated in the absence or presence of low TFE concentrations did not show an increase in ThT fluorescence, samples incubated at TFE concentrations in the range of 15-35% (v/v) produced a 6-fold increase (Fig. 1). TFE concentrations higher than 40% (v/v) led to a decrease in fluorescence intensity, yet not reaching values of zero. At the highest TFE concentration used (70% (v/v)), the intensity was about half of the maximum value. ANS is a hydrophobic dye that binds to solvent-exposed hydrophobic surfaces of a polypeptide chain (36Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripaoe A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Google Scholar). Whereas folded or unfolded states of proteins exhibit very weak binding affinity, conformational states with clusters of exposed hydrophobic groups feature a much higher affinity allowing this dye to serve as a marker for partially folded states (36Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripaoe A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Google Scholar). Recent reports (37Kremer J.J. Pallitto M.M. Sklansky D.J. Murphy R.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10309-10318Google Scholar) have shown that aggregates of the amyloid β peptide able to interact with the lipid bilayer of cell membranes are also able to bind and increase the fluorescence of ANS, most probably as a result of the exposure of hydrophobic clusters on the surface of these aggregated structures. Sso AcP was incubated for 30 min under the same conditions used for the ThT measurements. The samples were then used for the ANS assay. At TFE concentrations in the 15-25% (v/v) range, the ANS fluorescence emission was remarkably more intense than that of samples containing no protein (Fig. 2). Furthermore, under these conditions the ANS emission spectra appeared to have a maximum shifted from the wavelength of 515 nm, observed for free ANS, to that of 480 nm (Fig. 2A). Removal of the aggregates from the sample by centrifugation reduced almost completely the ability of the sample to increase the fluorescence of ANS. Therefore, the observed increase of ANS fluorescence is attributable to the binding of this dye to the aggregates, rather than to partially folded states that could possibly be present in the sample. Congo red spectra were also monitored in the presence of Sso AcP. The protein was pre-incubated for 30 min under the same conditions of temperature and pH and in the presence of 0, 20, 50, and 70% (v/v) TFE. Upon the binding of Congo red to ordered aggregates, the absorption maximum of the dye undergoes a red shift from 490 to ∼540 nm (38Klunk W.E. Pettegrew J.W. Abraham D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1273-1281Google Scholar). The spectra of Congo red obtained in the absence or in the presence of Sso AcP pre-incubated in buffer were highly superimposable, both presenting a maximum at 490 nm (Fig. 3A). By contrast, the spectrum obtained in the presence of Sso AcP, pre-incubated in 20% TFE, had an optical absorption higher than the control spectrum recorded in the absence of protein, throughout the whole wavelength range (Fig. 3B). This originated from the considerable light scattering produced by the protein that yielded an apparently increasing optical absorption as the wavelength decreased (Fig. 3B). The difference spectrum at 20% TFE, obtained by subtracting the spectra of the protein alone and of Congo red alone from the spectrum of the protein in the presence of Congo red, exhibited a maximum at ∼550 nm (Fig. 3C). No apparent maxima were obtained in the difference spectra at the remaining concentrations of TFE (Fig. 3C). Overall, the analysis carried out with ThT, Congo red, and ANS indicate the presence of ordered aggregates within the range 15-25% (v/v) TFE. Less ordered aggregated species seem to be present at higher TFE concentrations, whereas no aggregation seems to occur significantly at concentrations of TFE lower than 15% (v/v), at least on the time scale investigated here. Aggregate Formation Monitored by Dynamic Light Scattering—The evaluation of the presence and size of Sso AcP aggregates was achieved by a DLS analysis. The protein was incubated in various TFE concentrations ranging from 0 to 70% (v/v) for 30 min at 25 °C, pH 5.5. Fig. 4 shows the size distribution by intensity recorded for two representative samples pre-incubated in 0 and 20% (v/v) TFE. Aggregates with an apparent diameter of ∼200 nm were present in 20% TFE (Fig. 4, dotted line). On the contrary, a peak at ∼3.4 nm was present in the protein samples in 0% TFE along with other larger particles (Fig. 4, solid line). The 3.4 nm diameter is highly consistent with that determined for proteins of the acylphosphatase superfamily using NMR or x-ray crystallography (22Pastore A. Saudek V. Ramponi G. Williams R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 427-440Google Scholar, 23Thunnissen M.M. Taddei N. Liguri G. Ramponi G. Nordlund P. Structure. 1997; 5: 69-79Google Scholar, 24Rosano C. Zuccotti S. Bucciantini M. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 785-796Google Scholar), suggesting that this peak arises from the native monomer.

https://openalex.org/W1982849486,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are characterized by a marked propensity for local invasion and spread to cervical lymph nodes, with distant metastases developing in 30–40% of cases. HPV-16 is an important risk factor for HNSCC. How HPV enhances susceptibility to HNSCC is not fully understood, but seems to involve cofactors. In this study, we examined the effect of the cooperation between HPV-16 and the tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB-2 on E-cadherin/catenin complex patterns and neoplastic transformation of human normal oral epithelial (NOE) cells. We report that overexpression of ErbB-2 or E6/E7 alone does not affect E-cadherin/catenin complex patterns nor does it induce cell transformation of NOE cells. In contrast, coexpression of E6/E7 and ErbB-2 downregulates E-cadherin and catenin expression. This is accompanied by cytoplasmic localization of E-cadherin, as well as nuclear translocation of α, β, and γ-catenins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that E6/E7 cooperate with overexpressed ErbB-2 to induce tumor formation in nude mice and to upregulate cyclin D1 and c-myc expression. Our data suggest that E6/E7 cooperate with ErbB-2 in head and neck carcinogenesis, at least in part, via the conversion of β-catenin from a cell adhesion to a nuclear function, that is, to act as a potential transcriptional regulator. This conversion leads to the upregulation of cyclin D1, c-myc and other oncoproteins necessary for alteration of the E-cadherin/catenin complex and cell transformation of NOE cells."

https://openalex.org/W1996033641,"Mutations in the collagen-like domain of serum mannose-binding protein (MBP) interfere with the ability of the protein to initiate complement fixation through the MBP-associated serine proteases (MASPs). The resulting deficiency in the innate immune response leads to susceptibility to infections. Studies have been undertaken to define the region of MBP that interacts with MASPs and to determine how the naturally occurring mutations affect this interaction. Truncated and modified MBPs and synthetic peptides that represent segments of the collagen-like domain of MBP have been used to demonstrate that MASPs bind on the C-terminal side of the hinge region formed by an interruption in the Gly-X-Y repeat pattern of the collagen-like domain. The binding sites for MASP-2 and for MASP-1 and -3 overlap but are not identical. The two most common naturally occurring mutations in MBP result in substitution of acidic amino acids for glycine residues in Gly-X-Y triplets on the N-terminal side of the hinge. Circular dichroism analysis and differential scanning calorimetry demonstrate that the triple helical structure of the collagen-like domain is largely intact in the mutant proteins, but it is more easily unfolded than in wild-type MBP. Thus, the effect of the mutations is to destabilize the collagen-like domain, indirectly disrupting the binding sites for MASPs. In addition, at least one of the mutations has a further effect on the ability of MBP to activate MASPs.

Serum mannose-binding protein (MBP) 1The abbreviations used are: MBP, mannose-binding protein; MASP, MBP-associated serine protease; CRD, carbohydrate-recognition domain; CUB domain, domain found in complement subcomponents C1r/C1s, Uegf, and bone morphogenetic protein-1; EGF, epidermal growth factor; Hyp, hydroxyproline. interacts with carbohydrates on the surface of microorganisms and thus forms the pathogen recognition component of the lectin pathway of complement activation (1Gadjeva M. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 74-78Google Scholar, 2Jack D.L. Klein N.J. Turner M.W. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 86-99Google Scholar). MBP, which is also referred to as mannose-binding lectin, binds to surface arrays containing repeated mannose or N-acetylglucosamine residues. It circulates as a complex with one or more MBP-associated serine proteases (MASPs) that autoactivate when the complex binds to an appropriate surface. The surface recognition function of MBP is mediated by clusters of three C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) held together by coiled-coils of α-helices (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal portion of the MBP polypeptide consists of a collagen-like domain composed of Gly-X-Y triplets with a single interruption that forms a bend in the domain (3Wallis R. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 433-445Google Scholar). A short N-terminal domain contains several cysteine residues that form interchain disulfide bonds. Serum MBPs assemble into larger forms containing 2–4 trimeric subunits in rodents and as many as six subunits in humans. All three oligomeric forms of rat serum MBP, designated MBP-A, can fix complement, although the larger oligomers have higher specific activity. Many species express a second form of MBP. In rats, the second form, MBP-C, is found in the liver. MBP-C does not form higher oligomers beyond the simple subunit that contains three polypeptides. Analysis of chimeras between rat MBP-A and MBP-C suggests that the collagen-like domains contain the MASP-binding sites (4Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Google Scholar). Ficolins contain N-terminal collagen-like domains and C-terminal fibrinogen-like domains that bind carbohydrate and also activate complement through MASPs (5Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2281-2284Google Scholar). Ficolins are believed to play a role in innate immunity, although their physiological ligands are unknown. Three MASPs in humans, rats, and other mammals share a common domain organization (6Dahl M.D. Thiel S. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Willis A.C. Christensen T. Vorup-Jensen T. Jensenius J.C. Immunity. 2001; 15: 127-135Google Scholar, 7Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Stover C.M. Schwaeble W. Laursen S.B. Poulsen K. Willis A.C. Eggleton P. Hansen S. Holmskov U. Reid K.B.M. Jensenius J.C.

Dimerization and binding to MBP is mediated by an N-terminal segment consisting of two CUB domains separated by an epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domain (9Wallis R. Dodd R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30962-30969Google Scholar). MBP dimers form 1:1 complexes with MASPs, whereas MBP trimers and tetramers bind up to two MASP dimers (10Chen C.-B. Wallis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25894-25902Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the N-terminal portion of MASP-2 reveals an elongated molecule in which protomers interact in an antiparallel arrangement through interactions involving the first CUB domain and the EGF domain (11Feinberg H. Uitdehaag J.C.M. Davies J.M. Wallis R. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2348-2359Google Scholar). The remainder of each MASP polypeptide comprises two complement-consensus repeat modules and a serine protease domain. MBP·MASP-2 complexes are sufficient to trigger complement activation by cleaving C4 and C2 to form C3 convertase, which leads to release of the anaphylatoxin C3a and deposition of C3b on the cell surface (10Chen C.-B. Wallis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25894-25902Google Scholar, 12Vorup-Jensen T. Petersen S.V. Hansen A.G. Poulsen K. Schwaeble W. Sim R.B. Reid K.B.M. Davis S.J. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2093-2100Google Scholar). C3b targets the cell for phagocytosis or lysis by the later complement components. MASP-1 and MASP-3 are alternatively spliced products from a common gene (6Dahl M.D. Thiel S. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Willis A.C. Christensen T. Vorup-Jensen T. Jensenius J.C. Immunity. 2001; 15: 127-135Google Scholar). They are identical apart from the protease domain and a short segment that links it to the complement consensus repeat-2 module. MASP-1 may form part of the complement cascade by cleaving components C2 and C3 upon activation (13Rossi V. Cseh S. Bally I. Thielens N.M. Jensenius J.C. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40880-40887Google Scholar). The function of MASP-3 is not known. Genes encoding three different variant forms of human MBP are found at frequencies of up to 30% in some human populations (14Turner M.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 532-540Google Scholar). Individuals who are either heterozygous or homozygous for these variant alleles are immunocompromised. The immunodeficiency associated with MBP is particularly evident in children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years, because these individuals are susceptible to recurrent, severe infections. The Arg32 → Cys substitution results in almost complete failure to form higher oligomers. Inefficient complement fixation follows from the inability of single MBP subunits to bind and activate MASPs (3Wallis R. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 433-445Google Scholar). Proteins containing the Gly34 → Asp and Gly37 → Glu mutations form higher oligomers that fail to fix complement effectively. In previous studies, substitutions equivalent to the human mutations have been introduced into rat MBP-A, and truncated forms of MASPs have been shown to bind less efficiently to these variant proteins (9Wallis R. Dodd R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30962-30969Google Scholar, 15Wallis R. Cheng J.Y.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4953-4959Google Scholar). In the work reported here, recombinant fragments of MBP and synthetic peptides have been used to localize the binding site for MASPs within the C-terminal portion of the collagen-like domain of MBP-A. The binding motif is found in other MBPs as well as in ficolins, suggesting a general binding mechanism for the activating components of the lectin pathway of complement activation. Substitution of glycine residues on the N-terminal side of the hinge with aspartate or glutamate destabilizes the collagen-like domain and thus indirectly decreases the binding of MASPs. However, these studies and binding experiments with full-length MASPs indicate that at least the Gly37 → Glu form of MBP is specifically defective in the ability to activate MASPs. Mutagenesis and Expression Systems—Wild-type and mutant rat MBP-A as well as fragments of MASP-1 and MASP-2, comprising the N-terminal CUB and EGF domains with a C-terminal histidine tag, and catalytically inactive rat MASPs were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells as previously described (4Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Google Scholar, 9Wallis R. Dodd R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30962-30969Google Scholar, 10Chen C.-B. Wallis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25894-25902Google Scholar, 15Wallis R. Cheng J.Y.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4953-4959Google Scholar). The cDNA for MBP-C was modified to insert a factor Xa site by replacement of restriction fragments with synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides (Applied Biosystems). Truncated forms of MBP-A were created by ligating restriction fragments from the cDNA to a cDNA encoding the dog prepro-insulin signal sequence. The resulting constructs were inserted into the plasmid pED (16Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Google Scholar). Proteins were produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells as described previously for full-size MBPs and were purified by affinity chromatography on mannose-Sepharose columns (4Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Google Scholar, 17Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Google Scholar). Single subunits of the Cys6 → Ser mutant were separated from trace amounts of larger oligomers by anion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column (HR 5/5; Amersham Biosciences) as described (4Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Google Scholar). Radiolabeled MBP-A was produced by incubating confluent cells in methionine-free minimum essential medium α, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 0.5 μm methotrexate, and 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine mix (Promix cell labeling mix from Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h. Protein was purified as for unlabeled proteins. Purification of Collagen-like Domain—Purified MBP-C containing a factor Xa site (2 mg) in 2 ml of loading buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, and 25 mm CaCl2) was treated for 3 h at 37 °C with 10 μg of factor Xa (New England BioLabs). The reaction was stopped with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml by dilution from a stock solution of 30 mg/ml in ethanol. The digest was passed over a 2-ml column of mannose-Sepharose (18Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Google Scholar) to remove the CRD, and the column was rinsed with loading buffer. Fractions of 1 ml were collected throughout, and the collagen-like domain was identified by gel electrophoresis of aliquots from the fractions. The wash-through pool consisting of fractions 2–4 was injected in 1-ml aliquots onto a C4 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography column. The column was equilibrated with 20% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a gradient from 20 to 25% acetonitrile in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The identity of the fragment was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing in a Beckman LF-3000 sequencer. Separation of Oligomeric Forms of MBP-A—Conditions for separation of oligomers were similar to those used previously for the wild-type protein (4Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant MBP-A preparations were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.2, containing 10 mm EDTA and separated at 25 °C on a Mono-Q HR-5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) with a gradient of NaCl in this buffer, running from 0 to 0.075 m NaCl in 2 min and from 0.075 to 0.3 m NaCl over 45 min. Gel filtration chromatography was performed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.2, on a BioSep S3000 column (300 × 7.8 mm) from Phenomenex (Cheshire, UK) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Elution positions of different oligomeric forms were deduced from the behavior of the wild-type protein on this column (4Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Google Scholar). Peptides—Peptides produced by Bachem UK Ltd. (Merseyside, UK) were adjudged to be at least 95% pure by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and their masses were verified by mass spectrometry. Complement Fixation and Binding Assays—Complement-fixing activities of wild-type and mutant MBPs were measured using a hemolytic assay in which mannan-coated sheep erythrocytes, preincubated with MBP, were incubated with guinea pig serum as the source of complement (4Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Google Scholar). Lysis was measured by following release of hemoglobin monitored by absorbance at 541 nm. Solid-phase competition assays were performed essentially as described (9Wallis R. Dodd R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30962-30969Google Scholar), in which polystyrene plates, coated with the N-terminal three-domain fragment of MASP-2 or MASP-1/-3 were incubated with increasing concentrations of competing ligands in the presence of [35S]MBP-A reporter ligand. Levels of radioactivity were determined using a PhosphorImager SI (Amersham Biosciences). Data were fitted to multiple ligand binding curves by nonlinear regression using MicroCal Origin. The amounts of [35S]MBP-A were below the concentrations required for half-maximal binding in all binding assays. All data represent the mean ± S.E. from at least two separate experiments. Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism was measured on a Jasco J600 instrument in a 200-μl quartz cell with 1-mm path length. The temperature was allowed to equilibrate for 10 min between spectra. Spectra were averages of 10 scans obtained at 20 nm/min with a data collection rate of one point every 0.5 nm, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and a time constant of 2 s. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Samples were dialyzed extensively against 0.15 m NaCl, 25 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mm CaCl2. Aliquots (1 ml) of sample and dialysis buffer were degassed for 15 min prior to loading the sample and reference cells of a Calorimetry Systems Nano III calorimeter. All scans were preceded by 10-min equilibration at the starting temperature. In order to ensure the absence of gas in the samples, initial scans from 5 to 20 °C were repeated until a reproducible base line was achieved. Scans were then performed from 5 to 90 °C. Base lines were calculated using a fourth order polynomial equation to fit the data between 10 and 20 °C and between 80 and 90 °C as well as points at the minimum near 55 °C. Analytical Procedures—Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. In the case of the collagen-like tail, destaining was limited to two changes over a period of 20 min, as the dye rapidly dissociates from this fragment. Protein concentrations were determined by the alkaline ninhydrin method (20Hirs C.H.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 325-329Google Scholar). Curve fitting was performed with SigmaPlot software. Interaction of MASPs with Truncated MBP-A—In a first approach to defining the region of MBP-A that binds to the MASPs, the interaction of MASP-2 with a series of C-terminal fragments of MBP-A was assessed. Truncated forms of MBP-A lacking the short N-terminal domain, the collagen-like domain up to the interruption, or the entire collagen-like domain were produced (Fig. 1A). For comparison, MBP-A Cys6 → Ser, which cannot form intertrimer disulfide bonds, was used as a source of full-length trimers that do not associate into higher oligomers (4Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Google Scholar). Proteins that contain part or all of the collagen-like domain were produced in a mammalian expression system to ensure proper modification of proline and lysine residues. The shortest fragment, comprising the neck and CRDs alone, does not contain any of these modifications and was produced in Escherichia coli. All of the expressed proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on mannose-Sepharose and characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and equilibrium ultracentrifugation. Each fragment forms stable homotrimers (data not shown). Formation of MBP-A·MASP-2 complexes was quantified in solid-phase competition assays, in which MBP-A fragments compete with radiolabeled wild-type MBP-A for binding to the N-terminal portion of MASP-2 (Fig. 2). As expected from previous studies, the affinity of full-length, monomeric MBP-A for MASP-2 is substantially reduced compared with the native proteins that consist largely of higher oligomers. However, removal of the N-terminal domain and the N-terminal portion of the collagen-like domain did not further decrease the affinity of the proteins for MASP-2 (Table I). The smallest fragment, comprising the neck and CRDs alone, did not interact with MASP-2. Taken together, these results indicate that MASP-2 must bind to the C-terminal portion of the collagen-like domain, within the 12 Gly-X-Y triplets that lie between the hinge and the neck.Table IBinding properties of full-size and truncated MBPs Inhibition constants (KI) correspond to the concentration of each MBP fragment giving 50% inhibition of [35S]MBP binding to the N-terminal fragment of MASP. KI values of MBP are expressed as moles of trimeric subunits/l. Single MBP subunits or the smaller trimeric fragments bound to MASPs with lower affinities than the larger oligomers of wild-type MBP because there are binding sites for two MBP subunits on each MASP dimer (10Chen C.-B.

Comparable results were obtained in binding assays using truncated MBP-As (Fig. 2 and Table I), indicating that MASP-1 and 3 also interact with the C-terminal portion of the collagen-like domain of MBP-A. However, there is a slight loss in binding affinity when the N-terminal portion of the collagen-like domain is removed, suggesting that there may be some difference in the way that MASP-1 and 3 and MASP-2 interact with MBP-A. MASP Binding by Collagen-like Peptides—The sequences of multiple MBPs were compared in order to identify a potentially conserved MASP-binding site within the collagen-like region. The first five Gly-X-Y triplets on the C-terminal side of the hinge (triplets 6–10) are largely conserved in mammalian MBPs, whereas triplets further toward the C terminus are more variable (Fig. 1B) (21Sugimoto R. Yae Y. Akaiwa M. Kitajima S. Shibata Y. Sato H. Hirata J. Okochi K. Izuhara K. Hamasaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20721-20727Google Scholar, 22Ichijo H. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez L.J.

In addition, the regions N-terminal to the hinge and toward the C-terminal end of the collagen-like domain both contain multiple potential sites of glycosylation on hydroxylysine residues. Glycosylation of these sites has been experimentally documented in human MBP and rat MBP-A (4Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Google Scholar, 26Colley K.J. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10290-10295Google Scholar). The bulk of the multiple attached glycans might prevent association of proteins with this portion of the collagen-like domain. Consequently, the conserved region immediately to the C-terminal side of the hinge represents a potentially accessible, conserved target for MASP binding. Synthetic peptides covering portions of the collagen-like domain were used to map the MASP binding site in greater detail. Overlapping peptides were synthesized across triplets 1–12 (Fig. 1A). To enhance formation of triple helices, the MBP sequences were flanked by two Gly-Pro-Hyp triplets at each end (27Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14960-14967Google Scholar). Two of the four peptides tested bind to MASP-2 (Fig. 3). Peptide P3 binds with an affinity only 22-fold lower than full-length MBP-A subunits, indicating that the MASP-2 binding site must be located mainly within the region covered by this peptide, which represents triplets 6–10 of the collagen-like domain. Triplets 6 and 7 are also present in peptide P2, which shows no binding to MASP-2, but peptide P4, which contains triplets 9 and 10, does bind weakly. Thus, the binding site within triplets 6–10 appears to involve triplets 9 and 10. MASPs probably only bind to triple helical collagen, so it was important to determine whether the synthetic peptides form stable trimers. Equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that peptide P3 is largely monomeric at 4 °C, with only a small proportion of trimers (data not shown). Because only a fraction of peptides are in the correct conformation for binding to the MASPs, the measured binding affinity is likely to be lower than if they were all trimeric. Thus, the peptide-binding assays probably underestimate the affinities of MASP for binding segments of MBP-A. The roles of individual Gly-X-Y triplets were tested using additional synthetic peptides lacking potentially important residues in triplets 6–10. The strategy was to replace triplets in peptide P3 with the sequence Gly-Pro-Hyp, because these substitutions stabilize the collagen triple helix. Thus, decreased affinity resulting from these replacements reflects a change in the interaction with MASP and is not an indirect effect of decreased stability of the collagen helix. Triplets 8 and 10 already have the sequence Gly-Pro-Hyp, so three additional peptides were synthesized, in which triplet 6, 7, or 9 was modified. Changing triplet 9 completely abolishes binding, indicating that Lys46 and/or Leu47 make key contacts with MASP-2 (Fig. 3 and Table II). Mutations in triplet 6 decreased the binding affinity by only 2-fold, whereas mutations in triplet 7 had no effect on binding. These results are consistent with the results comparing peptides P2 and P4, which indicated that the primary binding site probably lies in the C-terminal portion of peptide P3. However, although the effect of changing triplet 6 is small, the result suggests that the binding site might extend back to the hinge.Table IIMASP-binding properties of collagen-like peptides Inhibition constants (KI) correspond to the concentration of each MBP fragment giving 50% inhibition of [35S]MBP binding to the N-terminal fragment of MASP.PeptideKIRelative KIaExpressed as KI,MBP Cys6 → Ser/KI, fragmentMASP-2MASP-1/-3MASP-2MASP-1/-3μmPeptide 1>700>850<0.003<0.001Peptide 2>700>800<0.003<0.001Peptide 356 ± 26610 ± 260.045 ± 0.0240.0017 ± 0.0001Peptide 3Δ6106 ± 2153 ± 90.017 ± 0.0030.0065 ± 0.0004Peptide 3Δ742 ± 6>8500.045 ± 0.013<0.001Peptide 3Δ9>700>850<0.003<0.001Peptide 4500 ± 50>8500.004 ± 0.001<0.001a Expressed as KI,MBP Cys6 → Ser/KI, fragment Open table in a new tab Comparable binding analysis with the N-terminal portion of MASP-1 and -3 revealed a similar but not identical pattern of results (Table II). Modification of triplet 9 again completely abolishes binding, but in this case a similar loss of binding is also observed when triplet 7 is changed. Surprisingly, changing triplet 6 to Gly-Pro-Hyp actually strengthens the interaction with the MASP-1/3 fragment. This effect is probably due to the increased stability of the triple helical form of this peptide due to the presence of the additional helix-stabilizing residues. This finding serves to emphasize that loss of binding activity resulting from changing the other triplets is probably partially compensated by increased stability of the triple helix, so the intrinsic effects of these changes are likely to be greater than what is measured in the assay. In any case, the results clearly indicate that Lys46 and Leu47 form part of the binding sites for all three MASPs, and Leu40 and Gln41 probably provide important additional contacts for MASP-1 and -3. Complement-fixing Activity by MBP-A Containing Mutations within the MASP-binding Site—In order to confirm the peptide binding results, it was of interest to assess the effect of disrupting the MASP-binding sites on complement-fixing activity of intact MBP-A. Recombinant MBP-A containing the changes Lys46 → Pro and Leu47 → Hyp was produced and purified in parallel with wild-type MBP-A, and binding to the MASPs was tested in the solid phase competition assay. No binding of the mutant protein to the N-terminal fragment of either MASP-2 or MASP-1/-3 was detected, demonstrating that the affinity in each case is reduced by more than 100-fold (Fig. 4). Complement-fixing activity was tested using MBP-dependent hemolysis of mannan-coated sheep erythrocytes. No activity was detected at the highest concentration of mutant MBP-A tested, which was more than 500-fold greater than levels of wild-type MBP-A needed to cause 50% lysis of the target cells (Fig. 5). Because the modified MBP-A still binds to mannose-Sepharose in a Ca2+-dependent manner, loss of activity is not due to a failure to bind to terminal-mannose moieties on the sheep erythrocytes. Furthermore, analysis by gel filtration and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the mutant protein resembles wild-type MBP-A both in terms of it oligomeric and its covalent structure (data not shown). A small increase in the proportion of single MBP-A subunits in the mutant MBP-A is not sufficient to account for the decrease in activity observed. Thus, mutation of Lys46 and Leu47 within the collagen-like domain of MBP-A abolishes all detectable complement-fixing activity as a consequence of disruption of the interactions with MASPs.Fig. 5Complement activation by MBPs.

Cheng J.Y.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4953-4959Google Scholar). In previous studies, the ability of these MBPs to interact with N-terminal fragments of MASP-1 and -2 has been investigated (9Wallis R. Dodd R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30962-30969Google Scholar). Although the mutations lie outside the proposed MASP-binding site, they decrease the affinity of MBP-A for MASP. Full-length MASPs that are catalytically inactive have recently been created by replacement of the active site serine residue with an alanine residue (10Chen C.-B. Wallis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25894-25902Google Scholar). The availability of these proteins makes it possible to examine the interaction of wild-type and mutant forms of MBP-A with the full-length MASPs to confirm the effects of the mutations.

https://openalex.org/W2050226161,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus (KSHV) is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). The KSHV G protein-couple receptor (vGPCR) is a homologue of the human IL-8 receptor that signals constitutively, activates mitogen- and stress-activated kinases, and induces transcription via multiple transcription factors including AP-1 and NFκB. Furthermore, vGPCR causes cellular transformation in vitro and leads to KS-like tumors in transgenic mouse models. vGPCR has therefore become an exciting potential therapeutic target for KSHV-mediated disease, but its signaling properties need to be better understood in the context of KSHV-infected hematopoietic cells. We recently described a PEL cell line that expresses vGPCR via an inducible promoter and have shown that vGPCR has broad capabilities of affecting cellular and viral transcription patterns in this highly relevant cell type. To elucidate the predominant signaling pathways used by vGPCR in PEL cells, we have used reporter gene assays to measure vGPCR activity in the presence of various pharmacologic enzyme inhibitors and plasmid constructs. We show that vGPCR-induced activation of AP-1 and CREB is mediated cooperatively by a Gq-ERK-1/2 and a Gi–PI3K-Src axis. Furthermore, unlike in other cell types, NFκB activation by vGPCR seems not to be substantially mediated by Gi or PI3K/Akt in PEL cells."

For these proteins, the intramembrane cleavage event is critically dependent on a high molecular protein assembly known as the γ-secretase complex, which displays enzyme kinetics characteristic of an aspartyl protease.

PS is a multipass membrane-spanning protein that, after endoproteolysis into an N- and C-terminal fragment (NTF and CTF, respectively), forms a stable, and presumably active, non-covalent heterodimer. PS has been proposed to provide the active site of the γ-secretase complex through two conserved transmembrane aspartate residues (15Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). Supporting evidence for the hypothesis that PS is an aspartyl protease comes from the identification of PS being a member of an aspartyl protease family consisting of polytopic transmembrane proteins having the conserved motif GXGD (X = variable amino acid) containing the C-terminal critical aspartate residue (16Steiner H.

Less is known about the other proteins in the complex, but it is becoming increasingly evident that the formation of the complex and the stabilization of the individual components is a coordinated and complex process. For example, PS is required for the proper maturation and cell surface localization of nicastrin (17Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent studies have shown that Pen-2 interacts with PS, nicastrin, and Aph-1 and that its expression is required for PS endoproteolysis and γ-secretase complex formation (21Steiner H. Winkler E.

However, several important questions regarding Pen-2 remain to be addressed, including how its subcellular localization and stability is regulated in relation to PS expression. In this report we demonstrate that PS1 controls the subcellular localization of Pen-2, such that Pen-2 is sequestered in the ER in the absence of PS. We also show that Pen-2 is ubiquitylated prior to degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner and presumably retrotranslocated from the ER to the cytoplasm. Finally, and in accordance with a recent report (23Crystal A.S. Morais V.A. Pierson T.C. Pijak D.S. Carlin D. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. J. Biol.

Antibodies used for immunoprecipitations, immunoblotting, and immunocytochemical experiments were anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-nicastrin (Sigma), anti-HA 12CA5 (Berkeley Antibodies Inc.), anti-PS1 loop MAB 5232 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-ubiquitin (Dako), anti-calnexin (a kind gift from Dr. Ralf Pettersson), anti-GM130 (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-APP CTF C1/6.1, and NT1 (a kind gift from Dr. Paul Mathews), and anti-PS1 Ab14 (generously provided by Sam Gandy). DNA Constructs—A cDNA encoding human Pen-2 was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase and cloned into the pDONR201 plasmid of the Gateway system (Invitrogen). The construct was further cloned into destination vectors using Gateway recombinase reactions to generate expression constructs encoding Pen-2 with an N-terminal FLAG tag and a C-terminal HA tag, respectively. In, addition, Pen-2-HA was subcloned using the Gateway system to generate pCAG-Pen-2-HA-IRES-Puro.

All PCR-based mutagenesis was carried out according to the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by sequencing using an ABI377 automated sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell Culturing and Transfection Experiments—CHOPro5 and 293T cells were cultured in alpha minimal essential medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). BD8 cells stably expressing PS1, BD8:PS1 cells, were cultured as BD8 cells with additional puromycin (1 μg/ml). Transient transfections were performed in 6-well tissue culture plates for co-immunoprecipitations, 24-well tissue culture plates for deglycosylation experiments, and 10-cm dishes for ubiquitylation experiments. All cells were plated at a suitable density the day before transfection. CHOPro5 and BD8 cells were transfected according to the LipofectAMINE Plus method (Invitrogen). For each well of the 6- and 24-well tissue culture dishes, 1 μg and 300 ng, respectively, of the indicated DNA constructs were included in the transfection mixture. 293T cells were transfected according to the FuGENE method. For each 10-cm plate 4 μg of the indicated DNA constructs were used in the transfection reactions. BD8 cells stably expressing Pen-2 HA, BD8:Pen-2-HA, were generated by transient transfection of BD8 cells with pCAG-Pen-2-HA-IRES-Puro. The transfected cells were cultured in medium supplemented with puromycin (1 μg/ml) for 1 week. Single puromycin-resistant colonies were expanded and analyzed for Pen-2-HA expression. Immunoprecipitation and Ubiquitylation Experiments—Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out 24 h post transfection. The cells were lysed in IP buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1% CHAPS, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies over night at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the reactions were left for another hour at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice in IP buffer and twice in PBS prior to SDS-PAGE (10-20% Tris-Tricine gels (Invitrogen)) and Western blot analysis. Ubiquitylation experiments were conducted with transiently transfected 293T cells and with BD8:Pen-2-HA cells, which were exposed to vehicle only (Me2SO) or MG-132 (5 and 50 μm, respectively) for 8 h prior to analysis. The cells were then lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl plus protease inhibitors, and 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide) and boiled for 5 min. The lysates were then diluted with 1200 μl of TN buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin plus protease inhibitors, and 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide) and the incubations were left on ice for 10 min. Immunoprecipitations were carried out for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-FLAG (293T lysates) and anti-HA (BD8:Pen-2-HA lysates) antibodies, followed by 1-h incubation at 4 °C in the presence of Sepharose G. After several washes in TN buffer, the immunoprecipitates were analyzed with immunoblotting for ubiquitinated proteins using anti-HA and anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Deglycosylation Assay and Proteinase K Protection Assay—The deglycosylation assay was performed 24 h post transfection in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 200 mm sodium citrate, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA plus EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.3% SDS, 0.6% β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H, Roche Applied Science) and peptide N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) were added where indicated. The deglycosylation reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h and then analyzed by Western blot. The proteinase K protection assay was carried out 24 h post transfection at 4 °C. CHOPro5 cells transfected with Pen-2-HA encoding cDNA were exposed to proteinase K (100 μg/ml) for 30 min and subsequently analyzed by 10-20% Tris-Tricine (Invitrogen) SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Subcellular Fractionation Studies—BD8 and BD8:PS1 cells grown in 15 cm plates to near confluency were used for all fractionation experiments. The cells were homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer (130 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors using a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was overlaid onto the top of a step gradient consisting of 1 ml each of 30, 25, 20, 15, 12.5, 10, 7.5, and 5% (v/v) Iodixanol (OptiPrep reagent, Axis-Shield PoC AS) in homogenization buffer. After a 3-h centrifugation at 126,000 × g (SW40 rotor, Beckman), 12 fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. Fractions were analyzed for the presence of Pen-2, nicastrin, and PS1 NTF, as well as protein markers of sub-cellular organelles by immunoblotting using 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). The intensity of all immunoreactive bands was determined using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Pharmacological Inhibition—BD8 cells were treated with MG-132 (Calbiochem), lactacystin (Sigma), ALLN (Sigma), calpeptin (Calbiochem), or chloroquine (Sigma) for inhibition of proteasomal, calpain, or lysosomal activity, respectively. BD8:PS1 cells were treated with MG-132 and chloroquine. MG-132 was used at 2.5 and 5 μm; lactacystin at 2.5 and 5.0 μm; ALLN at 2.5 μm; calpeptin at 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, and 10 μg/ml; and chloroquine at 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 μm. After an 8-h incubation period, cells were harvested and lysed in whole cell extract buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.42 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors. For analysis of endogenous levels of Pen-2, protein concentration in the lysates were determined by the Bradford method, and equal amounts of protein were loaded and resolved on 10-20% Tris-Tricine gels (Invitrogen), with subsequent detection of Pen-2 by immunoblotting. For the immunocytochemical experiments, cells were cultured for 8 h in the presence of 10 μm MG-132, 10 μm lactacystin, 10 μg/ml calpeptin, or 100 μm chloroquine before analysis. Expression Studies in the Presence of Cycloheximide—BD8 and BD: PS1 cells were plated in 6-well tissue-culture plates and transfected with expression constructs encoding Pen-2-HA, Pen-2-HA (K54R), or Pen-2-HA (K11R/K17A/K54R), from herein called Pen-2-HA (K0), the day before cycloheximide treatment. Transfected cells were exposed to 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h and then harvested in whole cell extract buffer. Protein levels were determined by the Bradford method and an equal amount of protein from each cell extract was then further analyzed for Pen-2 expression by immunoblotting using the anti-HA antibody. The same blots were stained with anti-β-actin antibodies to control for equal amount of protein loaded. Immunocytochemistry—BD8, BD8:Pen-2-HA, and 293T cells were seeded out on glass slides and in some experiments transfected with PS1 or PEN-2-HA encoding constructs. Cells were either treated with empty vehicle (Me2SO) or with different pharmacological agents for 8 h prior to analysis. The cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 15 min, blocked for 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution (PBS supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin, 10% goat serum, and 0.3% Triton X-100), and stained with primary antibodies in blocking solution at 4 °C over night. Following extensive washing in PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa 546- and 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Molecular Probes) and DAPI in blocking solution in darkness for 40 min. After thorough washing in PBS, the cells were mounted in ProLong mounting medium (Molecular Probes). Immunoreactivity was visualized in a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope and photographed using a Zeiss Axiocam. The subcellular localization of Pen-2 in the presence or absence of PS1 was determined using a Bio-Rad Radiance confocal microscopy unit. Images were assembled using PhotoShop (Adobe). γ-Secretase Complex Incorporation of Endogenous and Ectopically Expressed Pen-2—We first wanted to establish how Pen-2 associates with other known components of the γ-secretase complex. To this end, we raised an antibody (UD-1) against the N-terminal domain of Pen-2, which specifically labeled Pen-2 (Fig. 1A). In accordance with data from others (21Steiner H. Winkler E. Edbauer D. Prokop S. Basset G. Yamasaki A. Kostka M. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39062-39065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), we found that antibodies raised against both the N-terminal part of PS1 and the C-terminal part of nicastrin were able to co-immunoprecipitate Pen-2 in non-transfected CHO cells, suggesting that Pen-2 interacts with PS1 and nicastrin when expressed at physiological expression levels (Fig. 1B). Under these experimental conditions, it was however not possible to immunoprecipitate endogenous Pen-2 with the UD-1 antibody, and we were consequently unsuccessful in co-precipitating either PS1 or nicastrin. In contrast, if detergents known to disrupt γ-secretase complexes were included in the immunoprecipitation buffer, robust amounts of Pen-2 were pulled down with the UD-1 antibody (Fig. 1C). These observations are consistent with a previous study using an antibody raised against a similar peptide antigen in Pen-2 (21Steiner H. Winkler E. Edbauer D. Prokop S. Basset G. Yamasaki A. Kostka M. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39062-39065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and suggest that the UD-1 antibody interacts with a Pen-2 epitope that is hidden in the assembled complex. To study Pen-2 incorporation into γ-secretase complexes we therefore made use of N-terminally FLAG-tagged Pen-2 constructs, transiently transfected into CHO cells. Immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody pulled down transiently expressed FLAG-Pen-2 (Fig. 1D) and co-immunoprecipitated endogenous PS1 and nicastrin. The CHO cells used here contain detectable levels of full-length endogenous PS1, and it is worth noting that both full-length PS1 and PS1 NTF co-precipitated with FLAG-Pen-2 and that FLAG-Pen-2 appeared to preferentially associate with the mature form of nicastrin (Fig. 1D). To determine the influence of PS1 on Pen-2 incorporation into γ-secretase complexes, we transiently transfected BD8 cells, which lack both PS1 and PS2, or BD8 cells stably expressing PS1 (BD8:PS1), with FLAG-Pen-2. In BD8 cells, only minute amounts of FLAG-Pen-2 could be immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1E). In contrast, FLAG-Pen-2 was efficiently immunoprecipitated in BD8:PS1 cells and mature nicastrin as well as full-length PS1 and PS1 NTF were co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1E). Collectively, these results suggest that endogenous Pen-2 is part of the γ-secretase complex and that PS1 stabilizes Pen-2 and facilitates its interaction with nicastrin. Subcellular Localization of Pen-2—The expression and maturation of the components of the γ-secretase complex are coordinately regulated. For instance, PS is required for the proper maturation and cell surface localization of nicastrin (16Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A. Meyn L. Grim M.L. Baumeister R. Fechteler K. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 17Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and ablation of nicastrin affects PS stability (18Leem J.-Y. Vijayan S. Han P. Cai D. Machura M. Lopes K.O. Veselits M.L. Xu H. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19236-19240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 19Hu Y. Ye Y. Fortini M.E. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the next series of experiments we addressed whether PS1, in addition to its role in the stabilization of Pen-2, also affected its subcellular localization. We therefore analyzed the subcellular localization of Pen-2 in BD8 and BD8:PS1 cells using discontinuous 5-30% iodixanol gradients. In BD8 cells, Pen-2 immunoreactivity was found in fractions that are positive for calnexin, suggesting that endogenous Pen-2 is localized in ER-enriched fractions in the absence of PS (Fig. 2A, upper panel). In BD8 cells, the Pen-2-positive fractions are also enriched for nicastrin. Because it has previously been shown that, in the absence of PS, nicastrin does not exit the ER (17Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), this further corroborates the notion that Pen-2 is retained in the ER in the absence of PS. In the BD8:PS1 cells expressing PS1, a significant amount of Pen-2 was found in lighter, non-ER- and non-Golgi-enriched fractions (Fig. 2A, lower panel). These fractions also contained PS1 NTF and nicastrin, the latter almost exclusively in the form of the mature molecule (Fig. 2, A and B). Retention of Pen-2 in the ER in the absence of PS was further supported by immunocytochemical localization of Pen-2. We generated BD8 cells stably expressing Pen-2-HA and examined the intracellular localization of Pen-2-HA in the presence and absence of transiently transfected PS1. In the absence of PS1, Pen-2-HA showed an ER-like staining and co-localized with the ER marker calnexin, whereas in the presence of PS1, Pen-2 HA showed a broader expression pattern and only partially co-localized with calnexin (Fig. 2C). Consequently, the subcellular localization of Pen-2 is dependent on PS1: in the presence of PS1, Pen-2 is trafficked to compartments that have previously been shown to contain other components of the mature γ-secretase complex. Combined with the results shown in Fig. 1D, these data suggest that PS1 and Pen-2 interact early in the secretory pathway and that they remain associated during γ-secretase complex assembly, maturation, and trafficking. Proteasomal Degradation of Pen-2—To learn more about how Pen-2 is destabilized in the absence of PS (Figs. 1E and 2), we determined whether Pen-2 is degraded via the lysosomal or proteasomal pathways in the absence of PS1. BD8 and BD8: PS1 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of either the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine or the general and more specific proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and lactacystin, respectively. It appears that Pen-2 is not degraded in the lysosome, because chloroquine treatment did not stabilize Pen-2 in the absence of PS, whereas the same treatment stabilized APP-CTF, in accordance with previous data (25Caporaso G.L. Gandy S.E. Buxbaum J.D. Ramabhadran T.V. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3055-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, A-C). A calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, did not affect the stability of Pen-2, whereas it stabilized APP-CTF, consistent with previous reports (26Mathews P.M. Jiang Y. Schmidt S.D. Grbovic O.M. Mercken M. Nixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36415-36424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3D). In contrast, all three proteasome inhibitors, MG-132, lactacystin, and ALLN, stabilized Pen-2 to a considerable extent (Fig. 3B) as determined by Western blot analysis. This suggests that Pen-2 is degraded by the proteasome in the absence of PS, and to corroborate t"

PEBP is a soluble cytoplasmic protein, also associated with plasma and reticulum membranes of numerous cell types. In the present report, using biochemistry and cell biology techniques, we report for the first time the presence of PEBP in bovine chromaffin cell, a well described secretion model. We have examined its presence at the subcellular level and characterized this protein on both secretory granule membranes and intragranular matrix. In addition, its presence in bovine chromaffin cell and platelet exocytotic medium, as well as in serum, was reported showing that it is secreted. Like many other proteins that lack signal sequence, PEBP may be secreted through non-classic signal secretory mechanisms, which could be due to interactions with granule membrane lipids and lipid rafts. By two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, HCNP was detected among the intragranular matrix components. The observation that PEBP and HCNP were secreted with catecholamines into the circulation prompted us to investigate endocrine effects of this peptide on cardiovascular system. By using as bioassay an isolated and perfused frog (Rana esculenta) heart preparation, we show here that HCNP acts on the cardiac mechanical performance exerting a negative inotropism and counteracting the adrenergic stimulation of isoproterenol. All together, these data suggest that PEBP and HCNP might be considered as new endocrine factors involved in cardiac physiology.

Chromaffin cells are derived from the neural crest and constitute the adrenal medulla. In the adrenal medullary chromaffin cell, secretory granules contain a complex mixture of proteins and peptides that are co-released with catecholamines into the circulation in response to splanchnic nerve stimulation (1Goumon Y.

Among the high molecular mass water-soluble proteins, proenkephalin-A and the chromogranins family constitute the major constituents of chromaffin granules with other neuropeptides (neuropeptide Y, vasointestinal peptide, and others). These proteins are actively processed in the intragranular matrix to peptides with various molecular weight (1Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Kieffer B. Lefevre J.F. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D.

Several reports have also described the presence of PEBP immunoreactivity in biological fluids, including rat haploid testicular germ cell secretions (12Saunders P.T. McKinnell C. Millar M.R.

PEBP and its N-terminal-derived peptide named hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide (HCNP), corresponding to the first eleven N-terminal amino acid residues (PEBP1-11), were also found in synaptic vesicles after subcellular fractionation and were detected by immunohistochemistry in nerve cell terminals of neurons in rat brain (10Ojika K.

Because PEBP lacks signal sequence, this protein might follow a non-classic secretion pathway as many others proteins (19Rubartelli A. Sitia R. Kuchler K. Rubartelli A. Holland B. Unusual Secretory Pathways: From Bacteria to Man. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1997: 87-114Google Scholar). Because PEBP has been previously immunodetected in adrenal gland, in this report we looked for the localization of PEBP and HCNP in chromaffin cells using confocal laser and electronic microscopy, subcellular fractionation, Western blot analysis, purification by reverse-phase HPLC, sequencing, and mass spectrometry analysis techniques. We found them to be present in chromaffin secretory granules. They were also detectable in platelet secretions and in serum. Because upon a stimulation catecholamines display a positive inotropic effect on heart physiology (for review, see Ref. 20Wortsman J. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin.

The experimental model chosen was the avascular frog heart (Rana esculenta), isolated and working at physiological loads that represent an ideal system to explore the specific role of various cardioactive molecules on heart physiology (22Gattuso A. Mazza R. Pellegrino D. Tota B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H633-H641PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that HCNP acts on the cardiac physiology, indicating that it may be considered, with its precursor, as new endocrine factors.

Hubert P. Thierse D. Dirrig S. Vlahos C.J. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2347-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with either monoclonal mouse anti-human CGA367-379 (dilution 1:2) or affinity repurified rabbit polyclonal antibody against bovine PEBP (dilution 1:100) in NaCl/Pi buffer (0.9% NaCl (w/w), 25 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.5) containing 3% (m/v) bovine serum albumin. Cells were then washed (6 × 5 min) with NaCl/Pi buffer and incubated with secondary antibodies (Cy-3-conjugate goat anti-mouse IgG or Cy-5-conjugate goat anti-rabbit IgG at both the dilution 1:2,000) in NaCl/Pi buffer containing 3% (m/v) bovine serum albumin for 45 min at 37 °C. Finally, glass coverslips were washed twice in NaCl/Pi buffer and deionized water and mounted upside down on a glass slide with a drop of Mowiol 4-88. Various controls were carried out to assess antibody specificity and nonspecific labeling (omission of first antibody and absorption of the first antibody with the respective antigen prior to cell immunolabeling). Immunofluorescence staining was monitored with a Zeiss laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 inverted; Gottingen, Germany) equipped with a planapo oil immersion objective (63×, numerical aperture 1.4). Cy-5 was excited using the He/Ne laser 643-nm line. A long pass filter of 665 nm was used for Cy-5 fluorescence and was represented in red. Cells were subjected to optical serial sectioning to obtain images in the x-y plane. Each optical section was scanned eight times to obtain an average image. Images were recorded digitally at 768 × 576 pixels. Immunoelectron Microscopy—For electron microscopy, 2- to 3-mm-thick transverse slices of fresh bovine adrenal gland were fixed by immersion for 2 h at 4 °C with freshly prepared NaCl/Pi buffered 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde. The tissue was stored overnight at 4 °C in NaCl/Pi buffer and we have prepared vibratome tissue sections at 60 μm. Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (24Thiriet N. Jouvert P. Gobaille S. Solov'eva O. Gough B. Aunis D. Syed A. Zwiller J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after blocking nonspecific binding sites, free-floating vibratome sections were incubated successively in rabbit anti-RKIP/PEBP antibody (diluted 1:300 in NaCl/Pi buffer) and, after washing in phosphate-buffered saline, in biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:200 in NaCl/Pi buffer). Sections were then incubated with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector, CA), and peroxidase activity was detected with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and H2O2. Vibratome sections were then post-fixed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate-buffered 1% osmium tetroxide (pH 7.2) for 90 min, rinsed in the same buffer, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, and flat embedded in Spurr's resin. Thin sections, cut parallel to the surface of the original vibratome sections, were viewed without counterstaining at 60 kV with an Hitachi 7500 electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), and images were obtained with an AMT digital camera system (Advanced Microscopic Techniques Corp., Danvers, MA). Controls were performed in parallel omitting the primary antibody. Isolation of the Subcellular Fractions of Chromaffin Cells—Subcellular fractions (i.e. plasma membrane, cytoplasm, soluble granule matrix, and granule membranes) of chromaffin cells were isolated from bovine adrenal medulla dissected from 20 glands, according to a procedure first described by Smith and Winkler (25Smith A.D. Winkler H. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 480-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and previously modified by our group (5Kieffer A.E. Goumon Y. Ruh O. Chasserot-Golaz S. Nullans G. Gasnier C. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Faseb J. 2003; 10.1096/fj.02-0699fjePubMed Google Scholar). The soluble intragranular matrix was separated from granule membrane by centrifugation at 100,000 × g (30 min at 4 °C), collected, acidified with trifluoroacetic acid up to 0.1% to prevent proteolytic degradation, and stored at -20 °C (4Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Gadroy P. Strub J.M. Welters I.D. Stefano G.B. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38355-38362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Pellets corresponding to granule membranes were suspended in NaCl/Pi buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g during 30 min. To avoid possible contamination with intragranular matrix components, this procedure was repeated three times. Proteic material present in granule membranes was extracted by incubation during 2 h at 4 °C in 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. After centrifugation for 15 min at 100,000 × g, the supernatant containing granule membrane proteins was diluted twice in NaCl/Pi buffer. Samples were then loaded onto a Sep-Pak Plus C-18 cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA), previously activated with 100% acetonitrile, and washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Proteins were eluted with 60% aqueous acetonitrile solution containing 0.1% of trifluoroacetic acid, and the collected fractions were concentrated with a Speed-Vac (Savant Instruments, New York) and stored at -20 °C. To investigate in more detail the presence of PEBP in granule membranes, chromaffin granule ghost fraction (CGG) was prepared by subcellular fractionation of bovine adrenal medulla as previously described (26Terland O. Flatmark T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 597: 318-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The membranes were separately treated for 1 h at 4 °C with an equal volume of buffer A containing 20 mm sodium Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl pH 7; buffer B, similar to buffer A, with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100; and buffer C, as in buffer A, with 0.1% (v/v) saponin. Each incubation was followed by a centrifugation for 40 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was collected, and the pellet washed twice with buffer A before resuspending in this same buffer. Isolation of Proteins Released from Stimulated Chromaffin Cells—Chromaffin cells were isolated from fresh bovine adrenal glands, cultured as previously reported (2Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and plated in plastic Petri dishes. After 3 days in culture, chromaffin cells (2.5 × 106 cells) were subsequently stimulated for 10 min with 10 μm nicotine or 59 mm KCl in Locke's solution as previously described (2Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The extracellular medium of 2.5 × 106 non-stimulated cells (control) was collected, centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cells that might be present in secretions and acidified up to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to prevent proteolytic degradation (5Kieffer A.E. Goumon Y. Ruh O. Chasserot-Golaz S. Nullans G. Gasnier C. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Faseb J. 2003; 10.1096/fj.02-0699fjePubMed Google Scholar). In another series of experiments we have studied the secretion time course of CGA and PEBP. Cells (20 × 106 cells) were subsequently stimulated at 37 °C for 0 s, 30 s, 60 s, 90 s, 2 min, 3 min, 5 min, and 10 min with 4 ml of 0, 1, 10, or 10 μm nicotine in Locke's solution. The resulting fractions were acidified up to 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/water to prevent proteolytic degradation (5Kieffer A.E. Goumon Y. Ruh O. Chasserot-Golaz S. Nullans G. Gasnier C. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Faseb J. 2003; 10.1096/fj.02-0699fjePubMed Google Scholar) and concentrated 10 times. 400 μl of each fraction was dotted using a Bio-Dot (Bio-Rad, Ivry-sur-Seine, France) on a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). PEBP immunoreactivity present in the secretion was assayed using a specific affinity repurified rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against bovine PEBP (dilution 1:3000). Secretion efficiency was controlled with an intragranular granule matrix marker (CGA), by using a specific polyclonal anti-bovine CGA antibody (dilution 1:1000). The nitrocellulose sheet was treated as previously described (5Kieffer A.E. Goumon Y. Ruh O. Chasserot-Golaz S. Nullans G. Gasnier C. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Faseb J. 2003; 10.1096/fj.02-0699fjePubMed Google Scholar), and immunodetection was performed with the SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate kit (Pierce, Perbio Science, Brebières, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PEBP and CGA immunoresponses were evaluated by immunoreactivity of standard amounts of the human recombinant PEBP and human recombinant CGA1-76 and using the software Gene tools (SynGene Bioimaging, Ozyme, Paris, France). The amount of PEBP and CGA were expressed as the percentage of total PEBP or CGA secretions obtained for 100 μm nicotine and 600 s. Isolation of Proteins from Platelet Secretions—Platelet-rich plasma from 240 ml of hemachromatosis blood from healthy volunteers collected in acid citrate-dextrose (courtesy of the Blood Bank at Haukeland Hospital, Bergen, Norway) was passed through a Purecell PL filter (capacity 500 ml) to remove leukocytes. Platelets were pelleted in the presence of 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, and washed two times (0.15 m NaCl buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3). Platelets were suspended in the same buffer at 3.5 × 108 platelets/ml. This suspension (15 ml) was treated with control saline buffer or with 50 μm thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP) (27Sabo T. Gurwitz D. Motola L. Brodt P. Barak R. Elhanaty E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Suzuki H. Packham M.A. Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1995; 62: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 29Heijnen H.F. Schiel A.E. Fijnheer R. Geuze H.J. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 3791-3799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 5 min. Platelets were pelleted, and supernatants were collected and concentrated to dryness. Pellets and supernatants from control- and TRAP-treated platelets were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.05 m HCl, filtered through 0.22-μm filters and loaded onto a fast desalting column (PC 3.2/10, Sephadex G-25, Amersham Biosciences) using 0.05 m HCl as a mobile phase (SMART System, Amersham Biosciences). Desalted fractions were dried using a Speed-Vac and resuspended in loading buffer before Western blot analysis. In these experiments, ADP and ATP release from the platelet dense granules was routinely monitored as a positive control for secretion, and over 50% of platelet adenine nucleotides (nearly all of the secretable pool) was released. Preparation of Bovine Serum—Bovine blood was obtained from the Strasbourg slaughterhouse just after animal death. Serum was recovered after centrifugation (800 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and passed through 0.22-μm filters to remove red blood cells. An equal volume of glacial acetic acid was added to the serum (v/v), and, after a 15-min centrifugation (7000 × g, 4 °C), the supernatant was collected and used for further analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins from cytoplasm, granule matrix, plasma, and granule membrane proteins, as well as proteins secreted from chromaffin cells were separated on SDS-PAGE containing 17% acrylamide (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Secretion control corresponding to the medium recovered without stimulating agent was also loaded. Proteins were electrotransferred (45 min, 75V (31Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Biotechnology. 1992; 24: 145-149PubMed Google Scholar)) onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF; Amersham Biosciences) and immunodetected with specific affinity repurified rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against bovine PEBP (21 kDa, dilution 1:3000); a cytosolic marker, bovine phenylethanolamine N-methyl transferase (PNMT, 31 kDa, dilution 1:4000); a granule membrane marker, bovine dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH, 70 kDa for each subunit, dilution 1:2500); and a granule matrix marker, bovine CGA (66 kDa, dilution 1:1000). The PVDF sheet was treated as previously described (5Kieffer A.E. Goumon Y. Ruh O. Chasserot-Golaz S. Nullans G. Gasnier C. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Faseb J. 2003; 10.1096/fj.02-0699fjePubMed Google Scholar), and immunodetection was performed with the ECL-Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In human platelet secretion experiments, the secondary antibody was a goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated immunoglobulin (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich, France), and the detection was directly observed using a SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate kit (Pierce, Perbio Science). Furthermore, in these experiments a polyclonal anti-human ubiquitin antibody (dilution 1:700; Sigma Aldrich, Paris, France) was used to control the absence of cytoplasmic contamination and to check the absence of lysis of TRAP-treated platelets. The amount of PEBP present in each fraction was evaluated by immunoreactivity of standard amounts of bovine brain PEBP or the human recombinant protein using the software Gene tools (SynGene Bioimaging, Ozyme). The amount of PEBP was expressed as the percentage of total protein present in each fraction. To study the presence of PEBP in the chromaffin granule membrane fraction, CGG was applied onto nitrocellulose membranes for dot blot analysis. After treatment as described for Western blot analysis, the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with antibodies against PEBP, bovine chromogranin A17-39, and DBH. The blots were incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit protein IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate) and developed by using standard ECL reagents. The relative amounts of each protein in the fractions were estimated with Fluor-S™ Multimager and software QuantityOne (Bio-Rad, Illkirch, France). Purification of PEBP by Reverse-phase HPLC—PEBP in the soluble material from granules, cytoplasm, and secreted material from chromaffin cells, as well as in bovine serum extracts was purified using an Δkta Purifier HPLC system (Amersham Biosciences) and a Nucleosil reverse-phase 300-5C18 column (4 × 250 mm; particle size 5 μm, porosity 300 Å; Macherey-Nagel, Hoerdt, France). Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm, and the solvent system consisted of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water (v/v) (solvent A) and 0.09% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 70% acetonitrile in water (solvent B). Elutions were performed at a flow rate of 700 μl/min using the gradient indicated on chromatograms. N-terminal Sequence Analysis—The sequence of purified protein was determined by automatic Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 473A sequencer (Applied Biosystems/PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Samples purified by HPLC were loaded on Polybrene-treated and precycled glass fiber filters (2Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Phenylthiohydantoin-amino acids were identified by chromatography on a C18 column (phenylthiohydantoin C18, 2.1 × 200 mm). Mass Spectra Analysis—Mass analyses were performed using ES/MS on a Q-TOF II (Bio-Tech, Manchester, UK) in positive mode. Scanning was performed from m/z = 500 Da to m/z = 1500 Da in 1 s. Calibration was performed using the multicharged ions produced by a separate introduction of horse heart myoglobin (16,951.4 Da). Two-dimensional LC/MS/MS—Intragranular extract from bovine chromaffin granules was digested with sequencing grade trypsin previously chemically modified to eliminate chymotrypsin activity (ratio E:S = 1:20; Promega, Charbonnieres, France (32Bond J.S. Beyon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1989: 240Google Scholar)) during 12 h at 4 °C and then analyzed using a ProteomeX system based on the LCQ Deca XP Plus (ThermoFinnigan, Les Ulis, France) combined with a two-pump Surveyor LC system. The ion exchange chromatography was performed on a Thermo Hypersil Biobasic SCX column (0.32 × 100 mm). Mobil phase was constituted with 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in 5% acetonitrile (v/v) in water, and eight elution steps were successively performed with 0, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 500 mm ammonium chloride in 0.1% formic acid (v/v), 5% acetonitrile (v/v) in water. The reverse-phase separation was performed on Biobasic C18 column (0.18 × 100 mm; Thermo Hypersil). Solvent system consisted of 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in acetonitrile (solvent B). Elutions were performed at a flow rate of 130 μl/min, which was then split to 2 μl/min onto the reverse phase column. Elution was performed using a linear gradient from 5% to 65% of B solvent. Data were collected in data-dependent MS/MS mode with dynamic exclusion on. In this mode both full scan and MS-MS data were acquired continuously throughout the acquisition. The full scan mass range was m/z 350-1800 Da. Spectra were then analyzed using the research algorithm SEQUEST and bovine Protein Data Bank. Isolated and Perfused Working Heart Preparation—Frog hearts were isolated from specimens of both sexes of Rana esculenta (weighting 22.0 ± 1.2 g; mean value ± S.E.) and connected to a perfusion apparatus as previously described (33Sys S.U. Pellegrino D. Mazza R. Gattuso A. Andries L.J. Tota L. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3109-3118PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were done at room temperature (18-21 °C) from autumn to spring.

https://openalex.org/W2152447911,"We found, using a BLAST search, a novel human gene (GenBank™ accession number BC029564) that possesses β3-glycosyltransferase motifs. The full-length open reading frame consists of 500 amino acids and encodes a typical type II membrane protein. This enzyme has a domain containing β1,3-glycosyltransferase motifs, which are widely conserved in the β1,3-galactosyltransferase and β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase families. The putative catalytic domain was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells as a soluble protein. Its N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity was observed when N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) β1-O-benzyl was used as an acceptor substrate. The enzyme product was determined to have a β1,3-linkage by NMR spectroscopic analysis, and was therefore named β1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-II (β3GalNAc-T2). The acceptor substrate specificity of β3GalNAc-T2 was examined using various oligosaccharide substrates. Galβ1-3(GlcNAcβ1-6)GalNAcα1-O-para-nitrophenyl (core 2-pNP) was the best acceptor substrate for β3GalNAc-T2, followed by GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-O-benzyl, and GlcNAcβ1-6GalNAcα1-O-para-nitrophenyl (core 6-pNP), among the tested oligosaccharide substrates. Quantitative real time PCR analysis revealed that the β3Gal-NAc-T2 transcripts was restricted in its distribution mainly to the testis, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and ovary. Its putative orthologous gene, mβ3GalNAc-T2, was also found in a data base of mouse expressed sequence tags. In situ hybridization analysis with mouse testis showed that the transcripts are expressed in germ line cells. β3GalNAc-T2 efficiently transferred GalNAc to N-glycans of fetal calf fetuin, which was treated with neuraminidase and β-galactosidase. However, it showed no activity toward any glycolipid examined. Although the GalNAcβ1-3GlcNAcβ1-R structure has not been reported in humans or other mammals, we have discovered a novel human glycosyltransferase producing this structure on N- and O-glycans.

With the aid of bioinformatics technology, it is now possible to find candidate genes for glycosyltransferases that are distributed in relatively few tissues, are expressed at very low levels, or synthesize unknown structures.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12770-12778Google Scholar). β3Gal-T5 exhibits the strongest activity for Gal transfer to GlcNAc among β3Gal-Ts, and is restrictively expressed in colon, intestine, stomach, and pancreas (1Isshiki S. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe M. Kubota T. Kitajima M. Shiraishi N. Sasaki K. Andoh T. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12499-12507Google Scholar). β3Gal-T5 is responsible for the expression of the sialyl Lewis a antigen epitopes, a famous tumor marker, in cancer cells derived from such tissues (9Isshiki S. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Ikehara Y. Togayachi A. Furuya A. Shitara K. Kubota T. Watanabe M. Kitajima M. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar). β3Gal-T6 catalyzes a Galβ1-3Gal linkage and is responsible for the synthesis of Galβ1-3Galβ1-4 xylose (Xly)α-O-(Ser/Thr), the core structure of proteoglycans (4Bai X. Zhou D. Brown J.R. Crawford B.E. Hennet T. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48189-48195Google Scholar). iGn-T, cloned by the expression cloning method, can express polylactosamine on the cell surface (5Sasaki K. Kurata-Miura K. Ujita M. Angata K. Nakagawa S. Sekine S. Nishi T. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14294-14299Google Scholar). However, iGnT is not included in the β3GT family because it does not possess the β3GT motif. Four β3Gn-Ts (-T2, -T3, -T4, and -T5) have activity for the transfer of GlcNAc to the Gal-β-R residue from UDP-GlcNAc. Transfection experiments with each β3Gn-T showed the expression of a polylactosamine chain on the cell surface (2Togayachi A. Akashima T. Ookubo R. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Iwasaki H. Natsume A. Mio H.

In this study, DNA databases were searched using the amino acid sequences of β3GT family members with particular attention being paid to the existence of a transmembrane domain and the conserved motifs of β3GTs. Thus, a new member of the β3GT family was found and cloned for characterization. The new enzyme was demonstrated to be active in synthesizing a unique carbohydrate structure, GalNAcβ1-3GlcNAc, on both N-glycan and O-glycan. Carbohydrate structures determined to date are being accumulated in data bases such as GlycoSuiteDB (11Cooper C.A. Harrison M.J. Wilkins M.R. Packer N.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 332-335Google Scholar, 12Cooper C.A. Joshi H.J. Harrison M.J. Wilkins M.R. Packer N.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 511-513Google Scholar). However, not all carbohydrate structures have been determined. Although the GalNAcβ1-3GlcNAc structure has not been found in mammals, there is a possibility that it exists in tissues where this new enzyme is expressed. Materials—UDP-[14C]GalNAc was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Amersham Place, UK) and UDP-[3H]GalNAc from ICN Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). UDP-GalNAc and GlcNAc-β-benzyl (Bz) were obtained from Sigma. Construction and Purification of Human β3GalNAc-T2 Proteins Fused with FLAG Peptide—We performed a BLAST search of the data base at NCBI and identified a cDNA (GenBank™ accession number BC029564), homologous in amino acid sequence to the open reading frame (ORF) of β3Gal-T6. The putative catalytic domain of the enzyme (amino acids 35-500) was amplified by PCR using a single strand DNA derived from kidney total RNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The fragment amplified by 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGCCTGCAGATCAGTTGGCCTTATTTC-3′ and 5′-AACGCGGATCCGCGCTGTTATCTTGCTTGACATCGACAAGGA-3′ was inserted into pFLAG-CMV3 (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands) to construct pFLAG-CMV3-β3GalNAc-T2. The putative catalytic domain of β3GalNAc-T2 was expressed as a secreted protein fused with a FLAG peptide in HEK293T cells (a human embryonic renal cancer cell line). A 12-ml volume of culture medium was mixed with anti-FLAG M1 antibody resin (Sigma). The protein-resin mixture was washed twice with 50 mm TBS (50 nm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and suspended in 200 μl of each of the assay buffers. Screening for Donor and Acceptor Substrates for β3GalNAc-T2—To determine a donor and acceptor substrate for β3GalNAc-T2, all combinations of nucleotide sugars and monosaccharides were screened by a method described previously (13Hosomi O. Takeya A. Kogure T. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1989; 42: 77-82Google Scholar, 14Holmes E.H. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 630-646Google Scholar, 15Taga S. Tetaud C. Mangeney M. Tursz T. Wiels J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 56-65Google Scholar). N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferase Assay—The basic reaction mixture for assaying GalNAc-T activity contained 14 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, an appropriate concentration of UDP-GalNAc, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.4% Triton CF-54, a suitable amount of acceptor substrate, and the purified enzyme. After incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, the product was analyzed by various techniques as described below. Determination of Products of β3GalNAc-T2 with Mass Spectrometry (MS)—GlcNAc-Bz (10 nmol) was incubated with β3GalNAc-T2 in 20 μl of a basic reaction mixture containing 2.5 mm UDP-GalNAc to produce the reaction product. The reaction mixture was added to 80 μl of H2O and was filtrated using Ultrafree-MC (Millipore, Bedford, MA). A 50-μl reaction mixture was subjected to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an ODS-80Ts QA column (4.6 × 250 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo). The reaction products were eluted with 30 ml of 9% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and H2O at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 40 °C and monitored with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (absorbance at 210 nm), the SPD-10AVP (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). An additional peak was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS (Reflex IV; Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). Then, 25 pmol of the product was dissolved in 5 μl of H2O, and 45 μl of 0.1% formic acid, and added to 50 μl of methanol. The product solution was infused at a rate of 3 μl/min with a capillary voltage of 3 kV. For MALDI-TOF MS analysis, 10 pmol of the product was dried, dissolved in 1 μl of H2O, and applied. Determination of Products of β3GalNAc-T2 using 1H NMR Spectra—GlcNAc-Bz (640 nmol) was incubated with β3GalNAc-T2 in 1 ml of a basic reaction mixture containing 2.5 mm UDP-GalNAc to produce the reaction product. A 50-μl aliquot of supernatant was subjected to HPLC on an ODS-80Ts QA column (4.6 × 250 mm; Tosoh). The reaction products were eluted with 30 ml of 9% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and H2O at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 40 °C and monitored with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (absorbance at 210 nm), the SPD-10AVP (Shimadzu). The enzyme reaction product was purified with the HPLC technique as described above and lyophilized from D2O. Then, 100 μg of the lyophilized product was dissolved again in 0.18 ml of D2O for NMR analysis. One-dimensional 1H NMR and two-dimensional COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra were recorded with a DMX750 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany, 750.13 MHz for 1H nucleus) at 25 °C. The methylene proton of the Bz group in the higher field (4.557 ppm) was used as a reference for the 1H NMR chemical shifts. Substrate Specificity of β3GalNAc-T2—A GalNAc-T assay of human β3GalNAc-T2 using the synthetic oligosaccharide was performed as follows. [14C]UDP-GalNAc (50 nCi) and the oligosaccharides as the acceptor substrates were added to 10 μl of the basic reaction mixture. The acceptor substrates used in this study are listed in Table I. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of H2O. Radioactive products were separated from the free UDP-[14C]GalNAc using a Sep-Pak Plus C18 cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA). The cartridge was activated by washing with 1 ml of 100% methanol and then washed twice with 1 ml of water. The enzyme reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of H2O, then the reaction mixture was applied to the equilibrated cartridge and washed twice with 1 ml of water. Elution of the radioactive product was achieved using 1 ml of 100% methanol. The eluted solution was added to 5 ml of liquid scintillation mixture (Amersham Biosciences) then the radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter).Table ISubstrate specificity of β3GalNAc-T2Acceptor substrates%GlcNAc-α-BzNDaND, not detected.GlcNAc-β-Bz100Gal-α-pNPNDGal-β-oNPNDGal-NAc-α-BzNDGalNAc-β-pNPNDGlc-α-pNPNDGlc-β-pNP2GlcA-β-pNPNDFuc-α-pNPNDXyl-α-pNPNDXyl-β-pNPNDMan-α-pNPNDLactoside-BzbLactoside, Galβ1-4Glc.NDLac-CercLac-Cer, Lactosylceramide (Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1 ceramide).NDGal-CerdGal-Cer, galactocenebroside type 1 (Galβ1-1 ceramide).NDParaglobosideeParagloboside, Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1 ceramide.NDGlobosidefGloboside, GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1 ceramide.NDGalβ1-4GalNAc-α-pNPNDGalβ1-3GlcNAc-β-pNPNDGlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-β-Bz29Galβ1-3GalNAcα(core1)-pNPNDGalβ1-3(GlcNAcβ1-6)GalNAcα(core2)-pNP185GlcNAcβ1-3GalNAcα(core3)-pNP8GlcNAcβ1-6GalNAcα(core6)-pNP19a ND, not detected.b Lactoside, Galβ1-4Glc.c Lac-Cer, Lactosylceramide (Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1 ceramide).d Gal-Cer, galactocenebroside type 1 (Galβ1-1 ceramide).e Paragloboside, Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1 ceramide.f Globoside, GalNAcβ1-3Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glcβ1-1 ceramide. Open table in a new tab Quantitative Analysis of the β3GalNAc-T2 Transcripts in Human Tissues by Real Time PCR—For the quantification of β3GalNAc-T2 transcripts, we employed the real time PCR method, as described in detail previously (16Gibson U.E. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Google Scholar, 17Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Google Scholar). Total RNA from various human tissues was purchased from Clontech. cDNAs were synthesized using oligo(dT)12-18 primers and the Super-Script First-Strand Synthesis system (Invitrogen). A standard curve for β3GalNAc-T2 cDNA was generated by serial dilution of a pDONR™201 vector DNA containing the β3GalNAc-T2 gene encoding the putative catalytic domain (amino acids 35-500). The primer set and probe for β3GalNAc-T2 were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GGAGTGTTCTACGATGCCAAT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTGAAGCGAGCAATGAAGAG-3′; and probe, 5′-CACTGTCAAACTTTATCAGGCAGAACAAGAGG-3′. Primers, probe, and cDNA were added to the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), which contained all reagents for PCR. The PCR conditions included 1 cycle at 50 °C for 2 min, 1 cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, and 50 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. PCR products were measured continuously with an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Construction and Purification of Mouse β3GalNAc-T2 Proteins Fused with FLAG Peptide—In the EST data base of mouse cDNAs, two partial cDNA sequences (BQ963315 and BG923691) orthologous to β3GalNAc-T2 were found. The two cDNAs overlapped and encoded the full-length ORF of the mouse β3GalNAC-T2 (mGalNAc-T2) gene. PCR was performed to clone it using cDNAs prepared from mouse testis as a template. The full-length ORF sequence was confirmed and registered in GenBank™ under accession number AB116655. A truncated form of mβ3GalNAc-T2 was expressed in HEK293T cells with the same method described in the human β3GalNAc-T section. In Situ Hybridization in Mouse Testis—The partial sequence of mβ3GalNAc-T2 (nucleotides 311-1081 in AB116655) was amplified by PCR using pFLAG-CMV3-mβ3GalNAc-T2 as the template. The fragment amplified by 5′-TGTGGAAGACAGGGAGG-3′ and 5′-AGTCGTCATCTGTCTTGAGC-3′ was inserted into the vector pCR®-Blunt IITOPO® (Invitrogen) to construct pCR-TOPO-mβ3GalNAc-T2. Adult mouse testis fixed in Bouin's solution was embedded in paraffin and sectioned (7 μm) for in situ hybridization analyses. After linearization of pCR-TOPO-mβ3GalNAc-T2, sense and antisense digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were generated using an RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Hybridization signals were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody and NBT as the chromogen, as described previously (18Fujiwara Y. Komiya T. Kawabata H. Sato M. Fujimoto H. Furusawa M. Noce T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12258-12262Google Scholar). Detection of β3GalNAc-T2 in Mouse Testis by Western blot using Polyclonal Antibody—hβ3GalNAc-T2 expressed in insect cells, sf21, was purified for immunization of mice. A polyclonal antibody against hβ3GalNAc-T2 was bled from the mice. The antibody cross-reacted to mβ3GalNAc-T2. Recombinant β3GalNAc-T2 enzymes, which were purified from the medium of HEK293T cells transfected with the pFLAG-CMV3-mock, pFLAG-CMV3-hβ3GalNAc-T2 or pFLAG-CMV3-mβ3GalNAc-T2 vector, were subjected to Western blotting as controls. Tissue homogenates of mouse testis and spleen were used as experimental samples. Each sample was subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and treated with the polyclonal antibody against hβ3GalNAc-T2. The membrane was treated with anti-mouse Ig-HRP (Amersham Biosciences). The signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence and Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferase Assay with Glycoproteins—Fetal calf fetuin (FCF) was used as the acceptor substrate for β3GalNAc-T2. FCF was treated with β-galactosidase (Streptococcus 6646K, Seikagaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and neuraminidase (Nakarai Tesuque, Tokyo, Japan) in advance of the GalNAc-T assay. A 200-μg amount of each glycoprotein was incubated with β-galactosidase (5 microunits) and neuraminidase (50 microunits) in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) at 37 °C for 16 h. The reaction mixture was further incubated at 100 °C for 5 min to inactivate the glycosidases. A 10-μl volume of the glycosidase-treated samples was incubated with β3GalNAc-T2 in the basic reaction mixture containing 2.5 mm UDP-GalNAc (total volume, 20 μl). One microliter of the reaction products was subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) and stained with 0.1% horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA) for detection of the transferred GalNAc residue. The signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence and Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). To remove N-glycans, an aliquot of the reaction product was digested with glycopeptidase F (TaKaRa, Ohtsu, Japan) at 37 °C for 16 h. Determination of Nucleotide and Amino Acid Sequences of β3GalNAc-T2—We obtained a new sequence for the β3GT family as described under “Experimental Procedures” and named it β3GalNAc-T2. As shown in Fig. 1A, the ORF of β3GalNAc-T2 consisted of 1,500 bp encoding a predicted 500-amino acid protein with a typical type II topology, same as in the other β3GTs. It contained two N-glycosylation sites, a transmembrane segment of 19 residues, and a putative stem region and catalytic domain of 479 residues. The same sequence was found in a clone, GenBank™ accession number AL135928, which is located on chromosome 1. By comparison of the β3GalNAc-T2 cDNA sequence with the genome data base, the genomic structure of the β3GalNAc-T2 gene was determined (Fig. 1B). The β3GalNAc-T2 gene contains at least 12 exons. As shown in a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2A), β3GalNAc-T2 was most homologous to β3Gal-T6 in the human β3GT family. The three β3GT motifs, one of which contained a DXD motif, were conserved between β3GalNAc-T2 and β3Gal-T6 (Fig. 2B). Partial sequences highly homologous to human β3GalNAc-T2 were found in the mouse EST data base. Based on the partial sequences in EST, we cloned a full-length ORF of this gene. It showed 88.4% identity in amino acid sequence to human β3GalNAc-T2 as shown in Fig. 3. This mouse gene product is probably an ortholog of human β3GalNAc-T2, and was named mβ3GalNAc-T2. The mβGalNAc-T2 gene also contained at least 12 exons, and the junctions between exons and introns are at the same positions in hβ3GalNAc-T2 and mβ3GalNAc-T2 (Fig. 3).Fig. 2A phylogenetic tree of human β3GTs and an alignment of β3Gal-T motifs of β3GalNAc-T2 with those of β3Gal-T6.

This result indicated that the recombinant protein is probably glycosylated in HEK293T cells. Its glycosyltransferase activities, Gal-T, Gn-T, and GalNAc-T activities, were screened using each donor labeled with 14C. No Gal-T or Gn-T activity toward any acceptor substrate was observed (data not shown), whereas GalNAc-T activity was exhibited toward GlcNAc-β-Bz (Table I). The recombinant protein showed faint activity toward Glc-β-pNP, and no activity toward GlcNAc-α-Bz (Table I). On HPLC analysis as shown in Fig. 4, A and B, we observed a peak of an acceptor substrate (S) at 20.7 min and an additional peak (P) of the reaction product at 19.1 min when UDP-GalNAc and GlcNAc-β-Bz were used as a donor substrate and an acceptor substrate, respectively. The peak P was isolated by reversed-phase chromatography and identified using MALDI-TOF-MS (Fig. 4C). It gave two peaks of 554.154 and 558.194 m/z as shown in Fig. 4C. The two molecular masses, 554.154 and 558.194 m/z, exactly matched those of GalNAc-linked GlcNAc-Bz with Na+ and K+, respectively. Determination of the Linkage of the β3GalNAc-T2 Product with 1H NMR—To determine the newly formed glycosidic linkage of the β3GalNAc-T2 product, 1H NMR spectroscopy was employed. Although there were negligible weak signals from contaminants in the 1H NMR spectrum (not shown), signal integrals of five aromatic protons of Bz, two methylene protons of Bz, two anomeric protons, twelve sugar protons except anomeric protons, and six methyl protons of two N-acetyl groups corresponded well with the structure of GalNAc-GlcNAc-O-Bz. All 1H signals could be assigned after high resolutional recordings of COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra. The chemical shifts and coupling constants of the sugar component of the sample are shown in Table II. Two anomeric protons revealed signals with the same coupling constant, (J1,2) 8.4 Hz, as shown in Table II. This indicates that two pyranoses in the samples are in a β-gluco-configuration. The anomeric resonance at 4.398 ppm was relatively broad and showed a NOE cross peak with one methylene proton of the Bz group at 4.557 ppm (not shown). On the other hand, the anomeric resonance in the higher field did not show a NOE peak with any methylene proton (not shown). This indicates that the anomeric resonance at 4.398 ppm is responsible for the anomeric proton of the substrate pyranose (β-GlcNAc, defined as A), and that the anomeric proton at 4.381 ppm corresponds to the anomeric proton of the transferred pyranose (β-GalNAc, defined as B).Table IIChemical shift (ppm) and coupling constant (Hz) of sugar CH protons in the β3GalNAc-T2 productβ3GalNAc-T2 productGlcNAc (A)GalNAc (B)1H Chemical shifts (ppm)δ14.398aThe chemical shifts were set as the higher field signal of the benzyl methylene proton is tentatively 4.557 ppm.4.381aThe chemical shifts were set as the higher field signal of the benzyl methylene proton is tentatively 4.557 ppm.δ23.6873.711aThe chemical shifts were set as the higher field signal of the benzyl methylene proton is tentatively 4.557 ppm.δ33.599aThe chemical shifts were set as the higher field signal of the benzyl methylene proton is tentatively 4.557 ppm.3.655δ43.435aThe chemical shifts were set as the higher field signal of the benzyl methylene proton is t"

The precise function of c-Myc protein, and in particular the mechanisms to induce transformation by c-Myc in normal and neoplastic cells, are not well characterized.

HSP90 is also shown to enhance telomerase activity and activate endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (30Akalin A. Elmore L.W. Forsythe H.L. Amaker B.A. McCollum E.C. Nelson P.S. Ware J.L.O. Holt S.E.

HSP90 acts as a negative regulator of heat shock response by binding to heat shock transcription factor 1 and retains heat shock transcription factor 1 in the inactive, non-trimeric state (33Zou J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, Hsp90 can buffer out the activity of mutant proteins to suppress genetic variations caused by these mutant proteins and modulate the speed of molecular evolution (34Rutherford S.L.

Increased expression of HSP90 in different types of human tumors also suggests its possible role in facilitating transformation in different human cancers (breast, prostate, bladder, pancreas, endometrium, brain, etc.) (30Akalin A.

There is an E-box site in the 5′ promoter of HSP90A gene that binds c-Myc. Overexpression of HSP90A in Rat1a cells induces soft agar colony formation and tumor formation in nude mice tumorigenicity assays. Repression of endogenous HSP90A/Hsp86α expression by siRNA reduces the transformation activity of HeLa and RatMyc cells. These results demonstrate that HSP90A is a c-Myc direct target gene contributing to c-Myc-induced transformation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents, Cell Lines, and Plasmids—The lymphoblastoid cell lines, U937, EREB.TCMyc, Rat.MycER™, and RatMyc cells were described previously (42Gu W.

The HeBOCMVHSP90A plasmid was constructed by PCR-mediated generation of a ∼2.2-kb fragment of the full-length human HSP90A cDNA from the plasmid pBS-HSP90A obtained from Dr. K. Yokoyama (RIKEN, Tsukuba Institute). The primers used to generate this fragment are 5′-TGGCTGTGCCGCTAGCCCTGTGCGGTC-3′ and 5′-TAAGTCATCCCTCGCCGGCGATTAGTCTA-3′. This fragment was subcloned into the NheI-NotI sites of HeBOCMV vector to make the HeBOCMVHSP90A expression vector (43Wu K.J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and it was verified by sequencing. RatHsp cell lines were generated by transfecting the HeBOCMVHSP90A plasmid into Rat1a cells, and the cells were selected under G418 (400 μg/ml). The NIH3T3.Myc cell line, 293TMyci, and HeLaMyci cell lines were as described (45Chiang Y.C. Teng S.C. Su Y.N. Hsieh F.C. Wu K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19286-19291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The pSUPERHspi and pSUPERHspiR plasmids were generated by inserting the oligos of 5′-GATCCCTTCATCAGATGCATTGGACATTCAAGAGATGTCCAATGCATCTGATGAATTTTTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-GATCCCCCAAAGAGATCTTTCTGAGGGTTCAAGAGACCCTCAGAAAGATCTCTTTGTTTTTGGAAA-3′ into the pSUPER plasmids provided by Dr. R. Agami (46Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). HeLaHspi and RatMycHspi cell lines were generated by transfecting pSUPERHspi+pSV2Neo or pSUPERHspiR+pSV2Neo into HeLa or RatMyc cells and selection under G418 (250 μg/ml). Atlas human cDNA microarray filter was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA).Northern Blot Analysis—15 μg of total RNA was used in each lane of the Northern blots. The human HSP90A probe was generated by digestion of the pBS-HSP90A plasmid. The rat Hsp86α probe was generated by RT-PCR using rat-specific Hsp86α primers 5′-CCTAGTAAACTGGACTCG-3′ and 5′-CTTGTCACCATCCTTCTT-3′. The PCR fragment was subcloned into a pGEM-T vector and verified by sequencing. c-myc exon 3 and exon 1 probes were obtained from the pMC41RC and pMC41ER plasmids, respectively (47Dalla-Favera R. Gelmann E.P. Martinotti S. Franchini G. Papas T.S. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6497-6501Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The exon-3 genomic c-myc probe detects both endogenous and exogenous (pTCMyc plasmid) c-myc RNA species, whereas the exon-1 c-myc probe detects only the endogenous c-myc RNA, because exon-1 sequences are not present in the transfected pTCMyc plasmid. The human β-actin, vimentin, and GAPDH probes were described previously (43Wu K.J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar).

HindIII and BamHI sites were created to facilitate cloning. To generate the reporter construct driven by HSP90A promoter, a ∼1.4-kb fragment containing 1430 bp 5′ upstream of transcription start site was subcloned into the HindIII-BglII sites of the pXP2 vector to generate the HSPLuc1430 construct (44Wu K.J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The HSPLuc1430Mut construct was made by changing the sequence from CACGTG to CACCTG in the HSPLuc1430 construct by site-directed mutagenesis. This reporter construct (0.1 μg) was co-transfected with pMT2T, pMT2TMyc, or its deletion mutants (1 pmol) into 293T cells using the calcium phosphate transfection method. The total amount of transfected DNA and pMT2T sequences were kept constant in each experiment. A plasmid expressing the bacterial β-galactosidase gene (0.2 μg; pCMVβgal) was also co-transfected in each experiment to serve as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Two days after transfection, these cells were harvested, and their luciferase activities were assayed and normalized with β-galactosidase activities for transfection efficiency (44Wu K.J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Each transfection was performed in triplicate, and standard deviation bars were shown. Data shown here are representative of three or more experiments from independent transfections.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was performed following the procedure as described (45Chiang Y.C.

Briefly, CBMyc.Max, CB33 control, or EREB.TCMyc cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Fixed cells were washed twice with TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and harvested in 5 ml of SDS buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and suspended in 2 ml of IP buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 0.3% SDS, 1.7% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA). Cells were sonicated with a ¼-inch diameter probe for 15 s twice using an MSE-Soniprep1500 Sonicator (setting 18). For each immunoprecipitation, 1 ml of lysate was precleared by adding 50 μl of blocked protein A beads (50% protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) at 4 °C for 1 h. Samples were spun, and the supernatants were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with no antibody or polyclonal antibody specific for either c-Rel (SC-71; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or c-Myc (SC-764; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were recovered by adding 50 μl of blocked protein A beads and incubating overnight at 4 °C. Beads were successively washed with Mixed Micelle buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5% (w/v) sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS), Buffer 500 (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), LiCl detergent wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA), and TE and then eluted with 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3. 20 μl of 5 m NaCl was added to the elutes and incubated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse the cross-linking. After digestion with proteinase K, the solution was phenol/chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated. DNA fragments were resuspended in 50 μl of water. 5 μl of the resuspended DNA was used in a PCR reaction for 30 cycles. The PCR reaction generated a 280- or 212-bp product. The primers used to generate the 280-bp fragment are 5′-CCCAGCGTGCGCAACAGCTA-3′ and 5′-TCATAGCCAGGCCCTCGGAA-3′. The primers used to generate the 212-bp fragment are 5′-CCAAGTCCCCGATTCCCAAG-3′ and 5′-AAAGAATCCAGCCGCAAGCG-3′. Input is 2% of total input lysate. Data shown here are representative of two or more experiments from independent immunoprecipitations.Soft Agar Colony Assay—The stable clones were plated at three different cell densities (5 × 103, 104, 2 × 104) using standard assay conditions as mentioned except that 15% fetal calf serum was used (43Wu K.J.

Briefly, two Rat1a control clones, one RatMyc clone, and two RatHsp clones (107 cells each) were suspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and injected subcutaneously into 6-week-old athymic nude mice (BALB/c-nu mice; National Laboratory Animal Breeding and Research Center). Animals were monitored at periodic intervals for the appearance of tumors up to 50 days following injection.RESULTSActivation of HSP90A by c-Myc in Lymphoblastoid and Fibroblast Cell Lines Independent of Cellular Proliferation—To identify c-Myc target genes, we exploited a previously described B cell line (EREB.TCMyc) in which proliferation and c-Myc expression could be controlled independently (43Wu K.J.

Because in these cells the Epstein-Barr virus EBNA-2 gene (which induces B cell immortalization) is expressed as a chimeric fusion with the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor, estrogen (E2) removal leads to growth arrest (G0/G1) associated with complete down-regulation of endogenous c-myc expression (see Fig. 1A, +TC/–E2 lanes) (53Kempkes B. Spitkovsky D. Jansen-Durr P. Ellwart J.W. Kremmer E. Delecluse H.J. Rottenberger C. Bornkamm G.W. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Because these cells have been transfected with a tetracycline (TC)-repressed c-myc vector, exogenous c-myc expression can then be induced by TC withdrawal. Induction of c-myc is not sufficient to cause cell cycle entrance, and the cells remain quiescent and viable for several days (43Wu K.J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Using cDNA probes generated from RNAs harvested from cells in quiescent status (+TC/–E2) or from cells overexpressing exogenous c-myc (–TC/–E2), we screened a cDNA microarray filter containing cDNA clones corresponding to 1176 genes (Atlas Human array; Clontech). Among numerous genes displaying differential expression in c-myc expressing cells, we focused on the gene HSP90A because HSP90 was involved in many different aspects of cellular processes (12Caplan A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 262-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Pratt W.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 297-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its levels also increased in different tumor types (see the Introduction). To validate the result obtained from the microarray filter, we analyzed HSP90A expression upon c-myc induction in the same cells by Northern blot analysis. The results showed that withdrawal of estrogen and tetracycline (causing induction of exogenous c-myc) causes a 3-fold increase in the expression of HSP90A RNA (Fig. 1A). This result also indicates that c-Myc can induce HSP90A expression in the absence of cell proliferation.To further characterize HSP90A as a potential c-Myc target gene, we used a human Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B cells (CB33) engineered by transfection to express high levels of either c-Myc·MAX (CBMyc.Max) or MAX·MAX (CBMax) complexes, representing the two regulatory situations of high and low c-Myc function, respectively (42Gu W.

Here we report the cloning and sequencing of two genes (TbPMC1 and TbPMC2) encoding plasma membrane-type Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs) of T. brucei, an agent of African trypanosomiasis. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies against the proteins and against epitope tags introduced into each protein showed that TbPMC1 co-localized with the vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase to the acidocalcisomes while TbPMC2 localized to the plasma membrane. Northern and Western blot analyses revealed that TbPMC1 and TbPMC2 are up-regulated during blood stages. TbPMC1 and TbPMC2 suppressed the Ca2+ hypersensitivity of a mutant of S. cerevisiae that has a defect in vacuolar Ca2+ accumulation. T. brucei Ca2+-ATPase genes were functionally characterized by using double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi) methodology to produce inducible Ca2+-ATPase-deficient procyclic forms. Similar results were obtained with bloodstream form trypomastigotes, except that the RNAi system was leaky and mRNA and protein levels recovered with time. The induction of dsRNA (RNAi) caused gross morphological alterations, and growth inhibition of procyclic forms. Induction of RNAi against TbPMC1 but not against TbPMC2 caused elevated levels of cytosolic Ca2+ and decreased mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores following ionophore addition. These results establish that T. brucei PMCA-Ca2+-ATPases are essential for parasite viability and validate them as targets for drug development.

These results establish that T. brucei PMCA-Ca2+-ATPases are essential for parasite viability and validate them as targets for drug development. P-type ATPases are proteins involved in the active pumping of charged substrates across biological membranes and the formation of a phosphorylated intermediate during their reaction cycle is their distinguishing feature (1Carafoli E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 395-433Google Scholar). Ca2+-ATPases, within the P-type ATPase family, are involved in the unidirectional removal of Ca2+ from the cytosol. These pumps have been found in the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles of different organisms. A sequence analysis of conserved core sequences of all P-type ATPases has grouped them in five subfamilies designated type I-V (2Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Google Scholar). Type II covers Ca2+-ATPases (types IIA and IIB), Na+,K+- and H+,K+-ATPases (type IIC), a small family of fungal ATPases (type IID), and the solitary P-type ATPases of unknown function of some bacteria (2Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Google Scholar). Mammalian plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps (PMCA), which are responsive to calmodulin and extrude Ca2+ out of the cells, comprise one subcluster within type IIB. Sequences found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Google Scholar), Dictyostelium discoideum (4Moniakis J. Coukell M.B. Forer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28276-28281Google Scholar), Trypanosoma cruzi (5Lu H.-G. Zhong L. Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1998; 18: 2309-2323Google Scholar), Toxoplasma gondii (6Luo S. Vieira M. Graves J Zhong L. Moreno S.N.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 55-64Google Scholar), and Entamoeba histolytica (7Ghosh S.K. Rosenthal B. Rogers R. Samuelson J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 125-130Google Scholar) make up another subcluster. These enzymes are characterized by the absence of C-terminal calmodulin-binding sequences and their intracellular localization in compartments different from the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi complex. The S. cerevisiae (3Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Google Scholar) and E. histolytica (7Ghosh S.K. Rosenthal B. Rogers R. Samuelson J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 125-130Google Scholar) enzymes are localized in vacuoles, while the D. discoideum (8Marchesini N. Ruiz F.A. Vieira M. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8146-8153Google Scholar), T. cruzi (5Lu H.-G. Zhong L. Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1998; 18: 2309-2323Google Scholar), and T. gondii (6Luo S. Vieira M. Graves J Zhong L. Moreno S.N.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 55-64Google Scholar) enzymes are localized in very acidic compartments known as acidocalcisomes. Acidocalcisomes are characterized by their acidic nature, their high electron density, and their high concentration of calcium, magnesium, and other elements in addition to pyrophosphate (PPi) and polyphosphate (polyP) (9Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Google Scholar). Sleeping sickness, also known as African trypanosomiasis, is caused by protozoan parasites within the T. brucei complex. These parasites have a digenetic life cycle, with two main stages: the bloodstream form that lives in the bloodstream of its mammalian host, and the procyclic form that lives in the insect vector (tsetse fly). The parasite is spread to humans through the bite of the tsetse fly and is believed to infect 300,000-500,000 Africans, most in the sub-Saharan regions of the continent, and causes about 55,000 deaths each year. Chemotherapy against this disease, however, is unsatisfactory (10Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Parasitol. Res. 2003; 90: S10-S30Google Scholar). It is therefore important to identify enzymes and metabolic processes in T. brucei that might be potential targets for drug development. Trypanosoma brucei procyclic and bloodstream trypomastigotes have been demonstrated to accumulate Ca2+ in acidocalcisomes via a vanadate-sensitive Ca2+-ATPase (11Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 227-233Google Scholar). Although a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum-type Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) has been characterized in T. brucei (12Nolan D. Revelard P. Pays E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26045-26051Google Scholar), the information available on the presence of a PMCA-type Ca2+-ATPase is however limited to a few contradictory reports. Although a Ca2+-ATPase activity was initially reported in membrane-rich fractions of T. brucei (13Bababunmi E. Emech J.K. Bolaji O.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 402: 349-367Google Scholar), a further communication by the same authors described its absence (14Bababunmi E. Microbiol. Letters. 1987; 36: 71-76Google Scholar). In addition, a high affinity Ca2+-ATPase that does not show any demonstrable dependence on Mg2+ was also reported (15McLaughlin J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 15: 189-201Google Scholar) in the plasma membrane of T. brucei and it was suggested that this enzyme might have a role in the regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis in this trypanosomatid. The relative importance of this protein, however, has not been determined nor has it been demonstrated that this protein functions as a Ca2+ pump. A more recent report (16Benaim G. Lopez-Estraño C. Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 759-763Google Scholar) showed the presence of a calmodulin-stimulated Ca2+ pump in plasma membrane vesicles from T. brucei bloodstream forms. It is evident that a more thorough molecular characterization of the Ca2+-ATPases present in T. brucei will be essential for structure-function analysis and further development of potential chemotherapeutic agents. The feasibility of targeting this type of ion pumps for drug development is demonstrated by the current use of anti-ulcer drugs, surface-active glycosides, and artemisinin derivatives, against typical P-type ATPases such as the H+/K+-ATPase of the gastric mucosa (17Mattsson J.P. Väänänen K. Wallmark B. Lorentzon P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1065: 261-268Google Scholar), the Na+,K+-ATPase of the heart (18Schatzmann H.-J. Helv. Physiol. Acta. 1953; 11: 346-354Google Scholar), and the SERCA-type Ca2+-ATPase of the malaria parasites (19Eckstein-Ludwig U. Webb R.J. van Goethem I.D.A. East J. Lee A.G. Kimura M. O'Neill P.M. Bray P.G. Ward S.A. Krishna S. Nature. 2003; 424: 957-961Google Scholar), respectively. In the present study, we report the identification in T. brucei of the TbPMC1 and TbPMC2 genes, which encode proteins with homology to the PMCA-type Ca2+-ATPases of vacuolar and acidocalcisome localizations (3Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Google Scholar, 4Moniakis J. Coukell M.B. Forer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28276-28281Google Scholar, 5Lu H.-G. Zhong L. Souza W. Benchimol M.

Indirect immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies against a conserved region present in both isoforms showed their localization in the plasma membrane, and co-localization with the vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase (V-H+-PPase) 1The abbreviations used are: V-H+-PPase, vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ORF, open reading frame; RNAi, RNA interference; PMCA, plasma membrane-type Ca2+-ATPase. to the acidocalcisomes. Using antibodies against epitope tags introduced into each protein it was possible to demonstrate an acidocalcisome localization of TbPMC1 and a plasma membrane localization of TbPMC2. TbPMC1 and TbPMC2 were able to functionally complement the PMC1 gene, encoding the vacuolar PMCA-type Ca2+-ATPase of S. cerevisiae, providing genetic evidence for their function as calcium pumps. RNA interference (RNAi) studies demonstrated that these genes are essential cellular components for Ca2+ homeostasis, growth, and survival of T. brucei, especially in the presence of high extracellular Ca2+ concentrations, validating them as targets for chemotherapy. Culture Methods—Procyclic forms cell line 29-13 and bloodstream form BF cell line (114hyg5′-328, also known as the single-marker cell line), co-expressing T7 RNA polymerase and Tet repressor were gifts from G. A. M. Cross (Rockefeller University) (20Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Google Scholar). Procyclic forms were grown in SDM-79 (21Brun R. Schönenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of G418 (15 μg/ml) and hygromycin (50 μg/ml) to maintain the integrated genes for T7 RNA polymerase and tetracycline repressor, respectively. Bloodstream forms were grown in HMI-9 medium (22Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum with 10% Serum Plus (JRH Biosciences), and 2.5 μg/ml G418. Cell densities were determined using a Neubauer chamber. Procyclic forms were diluted to 1 × 106 cell/ml and bloodstream forms to 0.5 × 105 cell/ml and cultured in appropriate media. Growth curves were plotted by using the product of the cell density and the dilution factor. Chemicals and Reagents—DMEM, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Fetal bovine serum, Tween 20, Triton X-100, proteinase K, RNase A, Hepes, CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, EGTA, anti-α-tubulin antibodies, and poly-l-lysine (mol. wt 70,000) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Trizol reagent, Taq polymerase, SuperScript PCR buffer, Superscript II reverse transcriptase, and pCR 2.1-TOPO cloning kit were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation system and Prime-a-Gene Labeling System were from Promega (Madison, WI). [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit were from Amersham Biosciences. Zeta Probe GT nylon membranes and the protein assay were from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). The primers were purchased from Genosys Biotechnologies Inc. (Woodlands, TX). The pET-28a(+) expression vector, the Escherichia coli DE3 strain, the Quick 900 cartridge and the His-bind buffer kit were from Novagen (Madison, WI). The Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set III was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The pYES2 vector and the pBluescript II KS(-) vector were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Monoclonal antibody BB2 against the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ty1 virus-like particle (23Bastin P. Bagherzadeh A. Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Google Scholar) was a gift from Keith Gull (University of Oxford). Alexa 488 and Alexa 546-labeled antibodies were from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were analytical grade. Nucleic Acid Analysis—DNA was isolated by a standard procedure (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The polyadenylated RNA was obtained using the poly(A) tract mRNA isolation system. mRNA was electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels with 2.2 m formaldehyde, 40 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm MOPS, pH 8.0. Northern hybridization was done by a standard procedure (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using probes a (315 bp, N-terminal flanking and coding regions of TbPMC1), b (557 bp, N-terminal flanking and coding regions of TbPMC2), and c (TbPMC1.0, 1.0 kb, corresponding to the central regions of TbPMC1 and TbPMC2) (see Fig. 2B). The α-tubulin (TUB1) fragment used as a control in Northern blotting was obtained from the pZJM vector (25Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Google Scholar). Comparison of levels of TbPMC1 and TbPMC2 transcripts in procyclic and bloodstream forms was done taking as a reference the densitometric values obtained with the TUB1 transcripts and assuming a similar level of expression of this gene in both stages. Similar results were obtained when the densitometric values were compared by taking into account the amount of RNA added to each lane in three different experiments. DNA was run in 1.0% agarose gels with TAE (40 mm Tris, 20 mm acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0) buffer and transferred to Zeta Probe GT nylon membranes. DNA probes were prepared using random hexanucleotide primers, Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Prime-a-Gene Labeling System) and [α-32P]dCTP. The hybridized filters were washed under high stringency conditions (0.1% standard saline citrate-0.1% SDS at 65 °C), unless otherwise indicated. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to recognize the ATP phosphorylation site and the ATP binding site of cationic ATPase genes (26Allen G. Green N.M. FEBS Lett. 1976; 63: 188-192Google Scholar, 27Bassilian R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Google Scholar), i.e. 5′-CGGGATCCGTNATNTGYWSNGAYAA-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCGSRTCRTTNRYNCCR-3′ as the 5′- and 3′-primer, respectively. PCR was performed in a PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research, Inc., Watertown, MA) at 94 °C for 1 min, 55-62 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min/cycle (30 cycles) using Taq polymerase. PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T or the PCR 2.1-TOPO vector according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cloned PCR products were sequenced and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared with the data base in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™. A 1.0-kb PCR clone with identity to organelle-type Ca2+-ATPases was used as a probe to screen T. brucei 927 P1 genomic libraries (28Pierce J.C. Sauer B. Sternberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2056-2060Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method of Sanger et al. (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) with a 373A DNA Automatic Sequencer (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Internal oligonucleotide primers were designed to complete the DNA sequence in both directions. DNA and deduced amino acid sequence analyses were performed using the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group software package (GCG program, version 8.0). Hydropathy analysis was done using the method of Kyte and Doolittle (30Kyte J. Doolittle D.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar). The genomic sequences of TbPMC1 and TbPMC2 were deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ under the accession numbers: AF359561 and AF507073. 5′-RACE, 3′-RACE, and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—To obtain full-length cDNA, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique (31Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Google Scholar) was performed using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). First strand cDNA synthesis was primed with an oligonucleotide that annealed to 836-bp downstream of the putative start codon of the TbPMC1 ORF (RTP3′-1,5′-AAGAAGACTCACCGACGGCG-3′, 1011-1030 nt) in a reaction containing 1 mm dNTPs, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1× SuperScript PCR buffer, and 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. Target sequences were amplified in a standard PCR using the first strand cDNA as template and primers Tb5SL (5′-AACGCTATTATTAGAACAGTTTCTGT-3′), and a specific primer that annealed to a sequence just 421-bp upstream of the primer used for first strand cDNA synthesis (RTP3′-2,5′-GGATAAGCGACACACATGCG-3′, 570- 589 nt). Oligo dT primer (5′-ATGGATGCCTACAGCGCTCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) and specific primers, RTP3 (5′-AAGTGTTGGCCATCTGCACC-3′, 3071-3090 nt) and RTP4 (5′-TGTCGACGGTAGTGCCTCTC-3′, 3240-3249 nt), for 3′-RACE. PCR conditions were the same as described above except that the annealing temperature was 60 °C. The product of the amplification reaction was ligated into vector pCR2.1TOPO for sequence analysis. The complete cDNA sequence of TbPMC1 and TbPMC2 were deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ under the accession numbers AY065988 and AY065989. Preparation of Antibodies—Two primers, EXP1 (5′-GGATCCCGGACTGTGAATGACAA-3′) and EXP2 (5′-CTCGAGTCATACCATCCTTAATGTG-3′) derived from the TbPMC1 sequence (identical to TbPMC2) 796RTVNDN753 and 1100DTRMV1106, encoding 310 amino acids of the C-terminal region, were used to amplify a 933-bp fragment of the TbPMC1 or TbPMC2 gene. The excised fragment was ligated to the pET-28a(+) expression vector at the BamHI and XhoI sites, resulting in a construct that encoded the protein fused to a His6 tag that allowed its purification on nickel-agarose columns. DNA sequencing of the plasmid was done to ensure that the correct construct had been obtained. The recombinant plasmid was transfected into the DE3 strain of E. coli, the fusion protein was induced, and the expressed protein of 33 kDa, present in inclusion bodies, was solubilized and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rabbits were injected subcutaneously with 100 μg of fusion protein emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant, followed 2 weeks later by subcutaneous injection of 100 μg of fusion protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. At 6, 8, and 10 weeks following the initial injection, rabbits were boosted with 100 μg of fusion protein in PBS containing a 10 mg/ml suspension of Al(OH)3. Serum was collected before the initial injection (pre-immune serum) and 10 days after each boost. The antiserum was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Affinity purification of anti-TbPMC antibodies was carried out by elution from a column to which the His6-TbPMC fusion protein had been coupled. The affinity column was prepared by conjugating purified His6-tagged TbPMC (derived from a 1-liter culture of the transformed E. coli) to CNBr-activated 4B (0.5 ml of beads) as described by the manufacturer. The affinity matrix was incubated with 10 ml of anti-TbPMC1 antiserum 1:2 dilution in PBS for 16 h at 4 °C, washed four times with 20 vol of PBS, and the antibodies eluted in 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.8, 1 mm EDTA. The antibodies were immediately neutralized with 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris, pH 9.5, supplemented with sodium azide to a final concentration of 0.05%, and stored at 4 °C. Polyclonal antiserum from Balb/c mice was raised against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-conjugated synthetic peptide corresponding to the T. cruzi V-H+-PPase (NH2-734CNTGGAWDNAKKYIEKGGLRDKNKGKGS761-COOH) at the University of Illinois Biotechnology Center. SDS Electrophoresis and Preparation of Western Blots—The electrophoretic system used was essentially the same as that described by Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Freshly prepared T. brucei procyclic and bloodstream forms (1 × 108) were centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 10 min, and resuspended in 300 μl of Dulbecco's PBS containing proteinase inhibitors (1 μg of aprotinin per ml, 1 μg of leupeptin per ml, 1 μg of pepstatin per ml, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Aliquots of parasites (20 μl; 30 μg of protein) were mixed with 20 μl of 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 10% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 6.0% (w/v) SDS, and 0.4% (w/v) bromphenol blue as tracking dye, and boiled for 5 min prior to application to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose by the method of Towbin et al. (33Towbin H. Stahelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar), with a Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA) transblot apparatus. Following transfer, the nitrocellulose was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TPBS (0.1% Tween 20, 80 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) overnight at 4 °C. A 1:5,000 dilution of polyclonal antiserum in TPBS was then applied at room temperature for 60 min. The nitrocellulose was washed three times for 15 min each with TPBS. After incubating with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:20,000) and washing three times for 15 min each with TPBS, immunoblots were visualized on blue-sensitive x-ray film (Midwest Scientific, St Louis, MO) using the ECL chemiluminescence detection kit and following the instructions of the manufacturer. Functional Complementation of the PMC1 Gene of S. cerevisiae with TbPMC1 and TbPMC2—We transformed the S. cerevisiae vcx1 pmc1 strain K665 with the yeast expression vectors pYES2 and pYES2-TbPMCA1 and TbPMCA2 by a standard lithium acetate transformation procedure (34Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Google Scholar). The Ura+ transformants were selected by plating on synthetic-complete Ura medium (34Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Google Scholar). The TbPMC1 and TbPMC2 coding regions were amplified by the PCR technique using cDNA as template and HindIII and XbaI sites created on the PCR primers: YESP1 and YESP2 for TbPMC1, YESP3 and YESP2 for TbPMC2 (YESP1, 5′-AAGCTTACGATGGTTTCCCCAAAAGACAC-3′; YESP2, 5′-TCTAGATCATACCATCCTTAATGTG-3′ YESP3, 5′-AAGCTTAGCATGGATCCACTTGAGTCACC-3′). The TbPMC1 and TbPMC2 coding regions were placed at the HindIII and XbaI sites of pYES2 with the same orientation as the GAL1 promoter. The cultures were grown in YPD medium pH 5.5 containing 0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mm CaCl2 to identify Ca2+-tolerant transformants. Yeast strains K665 MATa (vcx1::hisGpmc1::TRP1) and K661 MATa (vcx1::hisG), kindly provided by Kyle W. Cunningham (Johns Hopkins University) (35Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Google Scholar), were grown at 30 °C in standard YPD medium (1% Difco yeast extract, Bacto Peptone, 2% galactose) or in YPD medium pH 5.5 (adjusted with succinic acid), supplemented with 0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mm CaCl2. Cell growth was assessed by measuring the optical density of the liquid cultures at 600 nm or by counting the number of colonies in plates. Both strains are isogenic and harbor the following additional mutations: ade2-1, can1-100, his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1, and ura3-1. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Parasites fixed with 4% formaldehyde were allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, 1% fish gelatin, 50 mm NH4Cl, and 5% goat serum in PBS for 1 h. The cells were stained with anti-TbPMC (1:100) against the 33 kDa expressed protein or polyclonal antibody against T. cruzi V-H+-PPase (1:100) and monoclonal antibody BB2 (1:100) against S. cerevisiae Ty1 (23Bastin P. Bagherzadeh A. Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Google Scholar) followed by Alexa 546 goat anti-rabbit or Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (1:1000, Molecular Probes). Control preparations were incubated with preimmune serum (1:100) or without the primary antibody. Confocal images were collected with a Leica laser scanning confocal microscope (TCS SP2) using a 63′ Plan-Apo objective with NA 1.32. Single optical sections were recorded with an optimal pinhole of 0.000293 according to Leica instructions. Adobe Photoshop was used for image processing. Double-stranded RNA Expression and Trypanosome Transfection—DNA fragments corresponding to the N-terminal flanking and coding regions of TbPMC1 from nucleotides 41 to 355 and to TbPMC2 from nucleotides 150 to 606 were amplified by RT-PCR from T. brucei procyclic cDNA, using primers: P15, 5′-CTCGAGCGGTAGGTGTCATTTGC-3′ and P13, 5′-AAGCTTCGACGCAACTGAACAAGGTG-3′; P25, 5′- CTCGAGGAGAGGAACGGATCGCTTGC-3′ and P23, 5′-AAGCTTTGTGTCTTATGTTCCTGCGG-3′ containing XhoI and HindIII linkers (underlined). To inhibit the expression of both TbPMC1 and TbPMC2 simultaneously, DNA fragments corresponding to the central coding regions of TbPMC1 from nucleotides 1468 to 2136 nt and TbPMC2 from nucleotides 1784 to 2452 nt were amplified by RT-PCR from T. brucei procyclic cDNA, using primers: P5, 5′-GCTCGAGATGTTCCGTGTCTCGAATCC-3′, and P3, 5′-CAAGCTTCTGGCACATTCGCACAG-3′, containing XhoI and HindIII linkers. The PCR fragments were cloned into the TA-cloning pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using BigdyeÔ Terminator v3.0 Ready Reaction Cycle Sequencing kit (ABI PRISM), and ligated into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the RNA interference (RNAi) vector pZJM (25Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Google Scholar), kindly provided by Paul Englund (Johns Hopkins University). For stable transfection of the procyclic host strain 29-13, the protocol was performed as described by Wang et al. (25Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Google Scholar). Briefly, procyclic forms (1 × 108) were washed once in 5 ml of cytomix (36Van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Google Scholar) and resuspended in 0.5 ml of cytomix containing 10 μg of plasmid that had been linearized by NotI digestion, so that it could target the rDNA spacer region (37Wirtz E. Clayton C. Science. 1995; 268: 1179-1183Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out in 2-mm cuvettes using a BTX electroporator with peak discharge at 1.6 kV, 50 microfarads. Immediately following transfection, parasites were transferred into 10 ml of SDM-79 supplemented with G418 and hygromycin. After 20 h, selection was applied by culturing in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin, and the parasites were grown for 2 or 3 weeks to form stable lines. For induction of dsRNA, parasites were cultured in the same medium containing 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline. Parasites were diluted 10-fold when densities reached a minimum of 1 × 106 cells/ml. They were not allowed to grow beyond 5 × 106 cells/ml before diluting again. For the bloodstream host strain BF cell line, the protocol was performed as described by Morris et al. (38Morris J.C. Wang Z. Drew M.E. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 111-113Google Scholar). Briefly, for each transfection, BF parasites were grown to mid-log phase (5 × 105 cells/ml) and 1 × 108 cells were washed once in 5 ml of cytomix and resuspended in 0.5 ml of cytomix containing 100 μg of plasmid that had been linearized with NotI. Electroporations were carried out at room temperature in 4-mm cuvettes using a BTX electroporator (peak discharge at 1.7 kV, 50 μF). Immediately following transfection, parasites were transferred in"

Factor VIII, a plasma protein that participates in the blood coagulation cascade, is decreased or defective in individuals with hemophilia A. Factor VIII functions as a cofactor for the serine protease factor IXa in the surface-dependent conversion of zymogen factor X to the serine protease, factor Xa (1Davie E.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 2Lollar P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 386: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Deficiency of factor VIII activity results in a marked reduction of factor IXa activity and in the subsequent rates of factor Xa generated during the propagation phase of coagulation. Factor VIII is synthesized as an ∼300-kDa single chain precursor protein (3Wood W.I. Capon D.J. Simonsen C.C. Eaton D.L. Gitschier J. Keyt B. Seeburg P.H. Smith D.H. Hollingshead P. Wion K.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27428-27434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Metal ions play an important role in regulating factor VIII structure and activity. Factor VIII is inactivated by EDTA, which facilitates dissociation of the HC and LC (6Fass D.N. Knutson G.J. Katzmann J.A. Blood. 1982; 59: 594-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Fay P.J. Anderson M.T. Chavin S.I. Marder V.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Active factor VIII can be reconstituted by combining the isolated subunits in the presence of Ca2+ or Mn2+ (12Fay P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Nordfang O. Ezban M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1115-1118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14005-14010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of low levels of Cu+ or Cu2+ stimulates this effect (11Tagliavacca L. Moon N. Dunham W.R. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27428-27434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Sudhakar K. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6874-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, it was thought that the linkage of HC and LC by a metal ion (Ca2+, Mn2+, or Cu2+) formed an active heterodimer. This interpretation was consistent with studies examining the reconstitution of factor Va from isolated subunits by Ca2+ or Mn2+ (16Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 964-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Krishnaswamy S. Russell G.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3160-3168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently evaluated the metal ion-dependent and independent association of factor VIII chains (18Wakabayashi H. Koszelak M.E. Mastri M. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10293-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the absence of metal ions, LC and HC combine to form an inactive heterodimer as demonstrated by fluorescence energy transfer. Ca2+ had little effect on inter-subunit affinity, yet converted the inactive dimer to an active, although low specific activity, form. Alternatively, Cu2+ enhanced the inter-subunit affinity ∼100-fold but yielded a dimer lacking cofactor activity. However, the presence of both metal ions resulted in a high intersubunit affinity and yielded high specific activity factor VIII. A recent study on the role of Ca2+ in factor VIII indicated that Ca2+ binding to both factor VIII chains was required for the generation of cofactor activity (19Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K.M. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8485-8492Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These studies also demonstrated a local conformational change in response to Ca2+ binding correlated with formation of the active cofactor. Factor VIII activity is also reconstituted following addition of Mn2+ (12Fay P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the Mn2+ binding site appeared non-identical to the Ca2+ binding site, based upon phosphorescence studies showing differential competition by Tb3+ (20Wakabayashi H. Zhen Z. Schmidt K.M. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Ca2+-binding proteins typically coordinate Ca2+ by 6–8 ligands comprising side chain carboxyl oxygen of acidic amino acids and carbonyl oxygen from the peptide bond (21Means A.R. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1995; 30: 89-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although Ca2+ binding motifs have been identified, many Ca2+-binding proteins coordinate the ion at sites other than a consensus sequence. Recently it was reported that residues 94–110 in factor V, a region rich in acidic amino acids, bound Ca2+, promoting the association of factor Va HC and LC (22Zeibdawi A.R. Pryzdial E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19929-19936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). An homologous region in factor VIII, residues 110–126, contains 4 Asp and 4 Glu residues in the 16-residue segment. In the present study, we show that Ca2+ binding to the A1 domain of factor VIII is critical for activity generation and directly demonstrate this binding by ITC using the isolated A1 subunit of factor VIIIa. Site-directed mutagenesis is employed to identify residues important in Ca2+ binding to factor VIII and resultant effects of this binding on activity. Results of this study identify several acidic amino acids within segment 110–126 of the A1 domain of factor VIII that are likely to participate in the coordination of Ca2+ necessary for generation of maximal cofactor specific activity. Furthermore, comparative data examining Mn2+ binding suggest that this ion binding site partially overlaps with the Ca2+ site. Based upon these data, we propose a model whereby occupancy of the metal ion binding site stabilizes a conformation between the A1 and C1 domains in the cofactor. Reagents—Recombinant factor VIII (Kogenate™) was a gift from Dr. Lisa Regan of Bayer Corp. (Berkeley, CA). Phospholipid vesicles containing 20% phosphatidylserine, 40% phosphatidylcholine, and 40% phosphatidylethanolamine were prepared using octylglucoside as described previously (23Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The reagents α-thrombin, factor IXaβ, factor X, and factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN), hirudin, phospholipids, MnCl2 (Sigma), and the chromogenic Xa substrate S-2765 (N-α-benzyloxycarbonyl-d-arginyl-glycyl-l-arginyl-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride; DiaPharma, West Chester, OH) were purchased from the indicated vendors. The B-domainless factor VIII (FVIIIHSQ) expression construct HSQ-MSAB-NotI-RENeo was a gift kindly provided by Dr. Pete Lollar and John Healey. Preparation of Factor VIII and Subunits—Factor VIII LC, HC, A1, and A2 subunits were isolated from factor VIII as previously described (24Fay P.J. Mastri M. Koszelak M.E. Wakabayashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12434-12439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Proteins were dialyzed into 10 mm MES, 0.3 m KCl, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 6.5, and stored at -80 °C. Construction, Expression, and Purification of Factor VIII Mutants— B-domainless factor VIII cDNA was restricted from the factor VIII expression construct HSQ-MSAB-NotI-RENeo, using the endonucleases XhoI and NotI, and cloned into the Bluescript II K/S-vector. Factor VIII molecules bearing single point mutation of Glu110 →Ala, Glu110 →Asp, Glu113 →Ala, Asp115 →Ala, Asp116 →Ala, Glu122 →Ala, Glu122 →Asp, Glu124 →Ala, Asp125 →Ala, or Asp126 →Ala, were constructed. Mutations were introduced into the shuttle constructs using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit as described (25Jenkins P.V. Freas J. Schmidt K.M. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Upon confirmation of the presence of only the desired mutations by dideoxy sequencing, the appropriate fragment was restricted and cloned back into the factor VIII expression construct. Presence of only the desired mutations was confirmed by a second round of dideoxy sequencing (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). The factor VIII expression vector constructs were transfected in baby hamster kidney cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The selection, subcloning, and cloning of stable transfectants were performed by standard methods, and the cloned cells were cultured in roller bottles (25Jenkins P.V. Freas J. Schmidt K.M. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The conditioned medium was collected daily, and the expressed proteins were purified using a one-step chromatography scheme as follows. The conditioned medium (∼0.3 liter) was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. The pH of the filtrate was adjusted to 6.0, and material was loaded onto a column of SP-Sepharose (5 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20. After washing with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, the bound factor VIII was eluted by with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.8 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20. Active fractions were detected using a one-stage clotting assay, pooled, and dialyzed against 10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.3 m KCl, 0.01% Tween 20 in Chelex 100-treated double-distilled H2O. Resultant factor VIII forms were typically >80% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with albumin representing the major contaminant. Factor VIII samples were quick frozen and stored at -80 °C. Factor Xa Generation Assays—The rate of conversion of factor X to factor Xa was monitored in a purified system (26Lollar P. Fay P.J. Fass D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) according to the method previously described (18Wakabayashi H. Koszelak M.E. Mastri M. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10293-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K.M. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8485-8492Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Activity was determined as the amount of factor Xa generated (nm) per minute and converted to a value per nm factor VIII. Preincubation of Factor VIIIa Subunits with Ca2+—Mixtures of A1 and A3-C1-C2 (2 and 1 μm, respectively) in 10 mm MES, 0.3 m KCl, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, pH 6.5) and A2 (10 μm in 20 mm HEPES, 0.05 m KCl, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2) were separately preincubated with 3 mm Ca2+ or 0.1 mm EDTA for 18 h at 4 °C. Reactions were initiated by mixing A1/A3-C1-C2 and A2 solutions at a final subunit concentration of 40/20/200 nm (A1/A3-C1-C2/A2) in 20 mm HEPES, 0.05 m KCl, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2 (residual Ca2+ and EDTA concentrations were 0.3 mm and 4 μm, respectively). At the indicated times, aliquots were removed and the activity was measured by the factor Xa generation assay. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry for Ca2+ Binding on A1—ITC was performed to measure Ca2+ binding to the isolated A1 subunit using a VP-ITC MicroCalorimetry Systems Instrument (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). The concentration of A1 was determined by A280 value using an extinction coefficient = 58,350 cm-1m-1 based upon the amino acid sequence for the A1 domain (factor VIII residues 1–372) according to the method of Gill and von Hippel (27Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar). A1 subunit (25.6 μm) was treated with 10 mm EDTA for 18 h at 4 °C, followed by dialysis against 10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.3 m KCl, 0.01% Tween 20. The dialysis buffer was made using Chelex 100-treated H2O, and the system was extensively washed with Chelex 100-treated H2O prior to use. Samples and buffers were degassed prior to analysis. The A1-containing solution was placed in a 1.44-ml sample cell. A 700-μl syringe loaded with 2 mm CaCl2 in the same buffer was used for a series of automatic injections of 2 μl each into the A1 solution while mixing at a rate of 290 rpm at 30 °C. The cumulative total of the heat evolved was plotted against the total Ca2+ concentration to produce a binding isotherm. Each injection was followed by a 240-s pause to allow the system to return to a base-line value. Because heat produced from dilution, as measured by injecting the Ca2+ solution into the sample cell containing only the buffer, was negligible, the uncorrected data were used for the analysis. An identical independent binding site model was fit to the data and thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy (ΔH0), Kd, and molar binding stoichiometry (n)) were determined by nonlinear least squares regression using ORIGIN software. Subsequently Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and entropy (ΔS0) were calculated from the fitted values. Factor VIII Activity Titration Using Ca2+ or Mn2+—Ca2+-EGTA buffer with free Ca2+ concentrations of 0–6.5 mm and Mn2+-EGTA buffer with free Mn2+ concentrations of 0–0.75 mm in the presence of 2 mm EGTA were prepared as previously described (19Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K.M. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8485-8492Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Wakabayashi H. Zhen Z. Schmidt K.M. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Wild type or mutant HSQ factor VIII (50 nm) was reacted in the Ca2+-EGTA buffer or Mn2+-EGTA buffer at 4 °C for 18 h, and resultant factor VIII activity was measured using the factor Xa generation assay. Non-linear least squares regression analysis was performed according to a single-site binding model using the formula Activity = (k·[Me2+]/Kd + [Me2+]) + C, where k is constant reflecting the metal ion induced activity, [Me2+] is either free Ca2+ or free Mn2+ concentration, Kd is the dissociation constant, and C is constant reflecting the basal activity in the absence of exogenous metal ion. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—A sandwich ELISA was preformed to measure the concentration of HSQ factor VIII proteins (25Jenkins P.V. Freas J. Schmidt K.M. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The procedure employed ESH8 (anti-factor VIII LC antibody; American Diagnostica) as a capture antibody and biotinylated R8B12 (anti-factor VIII A2 antibody; Green Mountain Antibodies) as the detection antibody. Thus, the epitopes for these antibodies are far removed from the sites of mutagenesis. The amount of bound factor VIII was determined optically using a streptavidin-linked horseradish peroxidase (Calbiochem) with the substrate O-phenylenenediamine dihydrochloride, (Calbiochem) as previously described (25Jenkins P.V. Freas J. Schmidt K.M. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Purified commercial recombinant factor VIII was used as the standard to determine the concentration of the samples. Factor VIII specific activity was determined from onestage clotting assays and ELISA and is expressed as units/μg. Statistical Analysis—Nonlinear least squares regression analysis was performed by Kaleidagraph (Synergy, Reading, PA) to obtain parameter values and standard deviations. Preincubation of Factor VIIIa Subunits with Ca2+ or EDTA Followed by Activity Reconstitution—Previously we demonstrated that maximal cofactor activity was achieved only when both HC and LC were preincubated with Ca2+ (19Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K.M. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8485-8492Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ca2+ binding to both HC and LC was necessary to generate active factor VIII. A similar evaluation of factor VIIIa reconstitution from the isolated A1, A2, and A3-C1-C2 was performed to determine the Ca2+ requirement for the HC-derived A1 and A2 subunits in activity generation. The reconstitution of factor VIIIa is a two-step process with the initial association of A1 and A3-C1-C2 comprising the rate-limiting step and requiring several hours to complete (28Regan L.M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8546-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, we completed this first step by mixing A1 and A3-C1-C2 subunits (2:1, mol:mol) in the presence of either 3 mm Ca2+ or 0.1 mm EDTA for 18 h. Activity generation was then monitored following the addition of A2 subunit, which, like the other subunits, was preincubated with either 3 mm Ca2+ or 0.1 mm EDTA. The reconstituted A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and A2 subunit were diluted 50-fold prior to reconstitution to prevent the EDTA-treated component from acquiring Ca2+ at the time of reconstitution. Furthermore, the reconstitution time course (30 min) was short enough so that the dissociation of Ca2+ from subunits upon their dilution was not a concern. Evaluation of the negative control (both A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and A2 subunit pretreated with EDTA) did not generate any activity over the reconstitution time course (Fig. 1). On the other hand, recombining the Ca2+-treated A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and A2 subunit resulted in the rapid generation of factor VIIIa activity (Fig. 1) that reached a maximal level within 10 min. When Ca2+-treated A1/A3-C1-C2 was associated with EDTA-treated A2, the generated activity was similar to the positive control (∼90% activity at 10 min and ∼80% activity at 30 min). Assuming the association rates for Ca2+ binding on each subunit was similar, these data suggested that there was little if any contribution of Ca2+ binding to A2 subunit for activity generation. Consistent with this result was the failure to reconstitute factor VIIIa activity with the Ca2+-treated A2 plus EDTA-treated dimer. These results, taken together with our earlier observation on the requirement for Ca2+ binding to HC for efficient factor VIII reconstitution (19Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K.M. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8485-8492Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), indicate that Ca2+ binding to A1 subunit is a prerequisite for activity generation. Ca2+ Binding to A1 Detected by ITC—The binding of Ca2+ to isolated A1 subunit was directly examined using ITC. Initial Ca2+ injections into the A1-containing solution showed a large exothermic peak (Fig. 2), providing direct evidence for binding of the metal ion to the factor VIIIa subunit. Data were fitted using an identical independent binding site model for cautious interpretation. The apparent thermodynamic values obtained from the binding isotherm were ΔH0 = -4.76 ± 0.03 kcal/mol and Kd = 0.74 ± 0.05 μm. ΔS0 and ΔG values were calculated as 12.3 cal/mol/K and -8.5 kcal/mol, respectively. Thus, ΔH0 comprised 56% of ΔG, indicating that there was nearly equal contribution of enthalpy and entropy to the free energy change following the binding of Ca2+ to the A1 subunit. The observation of a large entropy change upon Ca2+ binding to A1 suggested a complex mechanism likely involving a significant conformational component. Interestingly, a stoichiometry of 2.4 was obtained from the fitted data, indicating the presence of more than one Ca2+ site contained within the A1 subunit. Factor VIII Mutations of a Putative Ca2+ Binding Site in A1—The above data indicate the presence of a Ca2+ site(s) within the A1 domain of factor VIII that is (are) required for cofactor activity. Based upon the homology of factor VIII residues 110–126 to the residues comprising a putative Ca2+ binding site localized in factor V, we constructed a series of point mutations where acidic residues were replaced with Ala (or in some cases Asp). The stable transfectants were expressed as B-domainless factor VIII in baby hamster kidney cells, and recombinant factor VIII was purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” The freshly purified factor VIII preparations (mutants and wild type) were dialyzed against metal ion-free buffer, and specific activity values were determined by one-stage clotting and sandwich ELISA assays (Table I). This treatment resulted in the retention of a significant level of activity, as judged by a specific activity of 4.8 units/μg for the wild type factor VIII, while removing exogenous metal ions from the protein preparations. The activity observed under these conditions likely reflected retention of a metal ion(s), possibly Ca2+, which is (are) not readily released in the absence of chelators. This property is not the result of the presence of single chain factor VIII (∼30–50% of total factor VIII) in the recombinant preparations because partial purification of the factor VIII to enrich for single chain material yielded a similar specific activity as the unfractionated factor VIII preparation (data not shown).Table ISpecific activity of factor VIII wild type and mutant forms The activity and the concentration of each factor VIII preparation was measured by a one-stage clotting assay and by ELISA, respectively, as described under “Materials and Methods,” and specific activity was calculated.Specific activityWild type4.77 ± 0.54a>Units/μg(100.0)bRelative activity (% of wild type)E110A0.18 ± 0.03(3.8)E110D0.48 ± 0.09(10.1)E113A9.78 ± 0.03(205.0)D115A5.04 ± 0.49(105.5)D116A0.54 ± 0.02(11.3)E122A0.58 ± 0.01(12.2)E122D1.07 ± 0.24(22.4)E124A2.11 ± 0.10(44.3)D125A0.46 ± 0.01(9.6)D126A0.59 ± 0.13(12.5)a >Units/μgb Relative activity (% of wild type) Open table in a new tab Several of the Ala-substituted point mutations (E110A, D116A, E122A, D125A, and D126A) exhibited marked reductions in specific activity to levels of ∼4–12% of the wild type value (Table I). Thus, the reduction in volume of the side chain and/or loss in electrostatic potential may result in slight conformational changes within this region that impair cofactor activity. Because results from a prior study evaluating a Ca2+site in lactalbumin showed the importance of side chains when replacing critical residues (29Anderson P.J. Brooks C.L. Berliner L.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11648-11654Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we made selected, additional mutants with the conservative substitution of Asp for Glu at residues 110 and 122. As shown in Table I, significantly greater activity was retained in the E110D and E122D mutants (10.1 and 22.4%, respectively) compared with E110A and E122A mutants (3.8 and 12.2%, respectively). Cofactor Activity Generated from Factor VIII Mutants following Titration with Ca2+—Our prior studies examining Ca2+ binding in factor VIII employed isolated HC and LC prepared from the EDTA-treated heterodimer (18Wakabayashi H. Koszelak M.E. Mastri M. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10293-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K.M. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8485-8492Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mixing of chains in the absence of Ca2+ resulted in no regenerated activity. In the current study, limitations in the amounts of mutant factor VIII precluded chain separation and purification. However, we observed that the basal activity of the factor VIII measured in the absence of exogenous metal could be increased ∼2–3-fold with saturating levels of Ca2+. This incremental activity increase provided a functional assay for the binding of Ca2+ to the factor VIII A1 domain mutants. Increases in cofactor activity for the factor VIII wild type and 110–126 mutants in the absence of exogenous metal ion were determined following titration with Ca2+. Results are presented in Fig. 3 and are arbitrarily divided into high, moderate, and low activity factor VIII forms. Estimated parameter values determined by nonlinear least-squares curve fitting are listed in Table II. An optimized range of Ca2+ concentrations (0–6.5 mm) was selected to cover the complete change in activity for all factor VIII forms. We observed no significant increase in activity at higher concentrations of Ca2+ (>10 mm; data not shown). The k value indicates the difference between maximum activity at saturation with Ca2+ and minimum activity with no exogenous metal ion present (C value). Therefore, the k value was used as an indicator to assess the activity response for each mutant to added Ca2+.Table IIMetal ion binding parameters for factor VIII wild type and mutants Parameter values (k, C, and Kd) were calculated by non-linear least-square regression from the data shown in Figs. 3 and 4 using the formula shown under “Materials and Methods.” ND, not determined.Ca2+ binding parametersMn2+ binding parametersC (% of wild type)aC is the average of the estimated values obtained from Figs. 3 and 4KdkKdkμmμmWild type1.18 ± 0.3215.03 ± 1.09bFactor VIII activity is expressed as factor Xa generated (nm/min/nm factor VIII)(100.0)cRelative activity (% of wild type)1.40 ± 0.2412.37 ± 0.46bFactor VIII activity is expressed as factor Xa generated (nm/min/nm fac"
https://openalex.org/W2018243107,"Taxotere is a cytotoxin effective in treating breast and prostate cancer. It stabilizes microtubules and causes catastrophic cell cycle arrest in G2/M. Taxanes also initiate apoptosis by activating signal pathways, such as the jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Strategies aimed at potentiating cell death signaling may improve their efficacy while lessening the potential side effects. We reported that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) potentiated taxane-mediated cell death. Here we investigated whether ATRA potentiates cell death signaling through the JNK pathway. Activation of JNK by Taxotere 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 μ M was observed at 24 h in adherent cells and increased at 48 h. Taxotere 0.001 μ M-induced JNK activation started after 48 h and increased at 72 h. The timing and intensity of PARP cleavage was similar to that of JNK activation. JNK activation and PARP cleavage induced by 30 nM Taxotere at 48 h were reversed by curcumin, PD169316 and SP600125, JNK inhibitors in order of progressive specificity. None of these inhibitors had an effect on p38 or ERK phosphorylation. All three inhibitors reversed Taxotere-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2. ATRA induced JNK activation at 24, 48 and 72 h. Incubating cells with ATRA 0.01 μ M for 3 days prior to Taxotere treatment potentiated Taxotere-induced JNK activation 24 and 48 h later, an effect sustained for 72 h. Cytotoxicities from 3-day ATRA 0.01 μ M incubations were synergistic with subsequent 1-h Taxotere 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 μ M incubations in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 and in prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3, and additive in breast cancer cell line SK-Br-3. These data demonstrate the potentiation of Taxotere-induced cell death by ATRA pretreatment in breast and prostate cancer cells, and support a mechanism through accentuated and sustained JNK activation."
https://openalex.org/W2081171606,"The function of the ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related)-ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein) protein kinase complex is central to the cellular response to replication stress and DNA damage. In order to better understand the function of this complex, we have studied its interaction with DNA. We find that both ATR and ATRIP associate with chromatin in vivo, and they exist as a large molecular weight complex that can bind single-stranded (ss)DNA cellulose in vitro. Although replication protein A (RPA) is sufficient for the recruitment of ATRIP to ssDNA, we show that a distinct ATR-ATRIP complex is able to bind to DNA with lower affinity in the absence of RPA. In this latter complex, we show that neither ATR nor ATRIP are able to bind DNA individually, nor do they bind DNA in a cooperative manner. However, the addition of HeLa nuclear extract is able to reconstitute the DNA binding of both ATR and ATRIP, suggesting the requirement for an additional protein activity. We also show that ATR is necessary for ATRIP to bind DNA in this low affinity mode and to form a large DNA binding complex. These observations suggest that there are at least two in vitro ATR-ATRIP DNA binding complexes, one which binds DNA with high affinity in an RPA-dependent manner and a second, which binds DNA with lower affinity in an RPA-independent manner but which requires an as of yet unidentified protein.

Cell cycle checkpoints are highly conserved signal transduction pathways that alert the cell to the presence of DNA damage or replication stress (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Google Scholar). Activation of these pathways triggers a variety of downstream events, including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis. Defects in cell cycle checkpoint proteins can lead to increased genomic instability, a hallmark of tumor cells. Central to this pathway are a family of conserved phosphatidylinositol kinase-related (PIK-related) 1The abbreviations used are: PIK-related, phosphatidylinositol kinase-related; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; RPA, replication protein A; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; ATRIP, ATR-interacting protein; FATR, FLAG-tagged ATR; HEK, human embryonic kidney. 1The abbreviations used are: PIK-related, phosphatidylinositol kinase-related; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; RPA, replication protein A; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; ATRIP, ATR-interacting protein; FATR, FLAG-tagged ATR; HEK, human embryonic kidney. protein kinases. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Mec1 and Rad3 respectively, are the PIK-related kinases activated by both DNA-damaging agents and replication inhibitors (2Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Google Scholar). Among the PIK-related kinases identified in mammalian cells, DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase), ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated), and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) are known to be involved in the response to DNA damage (3Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Google Scholar, 4Smith G.C.M. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Google Scholar). Of these, ATM has been shown to be activated primarily by agents that cause DNA double-stranded breaks such as ionizing radiation (IR) or bleomycin (3Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Google Scholar). In contrast, like Mec1 and Rad3, ATR is responsible for signaling the presence of multiple types of DNA damage, including those induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, methyl methanesulfonate, IR, and inhibitors of DNA replication (5Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the ability of ATR to respond to such a diverse array of lesions may be due to the stalling of replication forks and subsequent generation of a common intermediate (6Lupardus P.J. Byun T. Yee M.C. Hekmat-Nejad M. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2327-2332Google Scholar, 7Stokes M.P. Van Hatten R. Lindsay H.D. Michael W.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 863-872Google Scholar).Knowledge of the manner in which ATR binds to DNA could improve our understanding of the mechanism by which DNA damage is sensed and checkpoint signaling is initiated. Previous studies investigating the DNA binding preference of the PIK-related kinase family members in vitro have revealed both direct and indirect DNA binding modes. DNA-PK, which exists as a holoenzyme consisting of the catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and the heterodimeric subunit Ku (Ku70 and Ku86), preferentially binds and is activated by double-stranded DNA ends under physiological conditions (4Smith G.C.M. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Google Scholar). This binding and activation requires the Ku subunits. Under low salt conditions, however, DNA-PKcs alone can bind and be activated by both single- and double-stranded DNA ends (ssDNA and dsDNA) in the absence of Ku (8Hammarsten O. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 525-530Google Scholar, 9Hammarsten O. DeFazio L.G. Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1541-1550Google Scholar). Similar to DNA-PK, ATM prefers to bind dsDNA ends in vitro (10Smith G.C.M. Cary R.B. Lakin N.D. Hann B.C. Teo S.H. Chen D.J. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11134-11139Google Scholar, 11Suzuki K. Kodama S. Watanabe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25571-25575Google Scholar). Unlike DNA-PK, however, purified ATM retains its ability to bind DNA in vitro, suggesting it does not require an additional factor for DNA binding (10Smith G.C.M. Cary R.B. Lakin N.D. Hann B.C. Teo S.H. Chen D.J. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11134-11139Google Scholar).The manner in which ATR binds to and is activated by damaged DNA is unclear. Xenopus ATR (XATR) (12Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z. Yee M.-C. Newport J. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Google Scholar) and human ATR (13Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Google Scholar) have been shown to bind chromatin, and other studies indicate that human ATR can bind ssDNA after partial purification (14Hall-Jackson C.A. Cross D.A.E. Morrice N. Smythe C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6707-6713Google Scholar). Recombinant, purified, FLAG-tagged ATR (FATR) has also been shown to weakly bind UV-damaged DNA in vitro (15Unsal-Kacmaz K. Makhov A.M. Griffith J.D. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6673-6678Google Scholar). In the yeasts, the ATR-related kinases Rad3 and Mec1 are found in higher order complexes with the checkpoint proteins Rad26 and Lcd1/Ddc2, respectively (2Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Google Scholar). S. pombe Rad26 undergoes Rad3-dependent phosphorylation in response to checkpoint activation by either DNA damaging agents or replication inhibitors, and this phosphorylation occurs in the absence of Rad1, Rad9, Hus1, and Rad17, all of which are necessary for downstream signaling (16Edwards R.J. Bentley N.J. Carr A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 393-398Google Scholar). A recent study using GFP-tagged Rad26 showed that Rad26 can localize to sites of damage in the absence of these other checkpoint proteins or the checkpoint kinase Rad3 (17Wolkow T.D. Enoch T. BMC Genet. 2003; 4: 6Google Scholar). Similar to Rad26, the S. cerevisiae homolog Lcd1 is phosphorylated by Mec1 in the absence of other known checkpoint proteins (18Paciotti V. Clerici M. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2046-2059Google Scholar, 19Rouse J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5801-5812Google Scholar, 20Wakayama T. Kondo T. Ando S. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 755-764Google Scholar). In vitro, purified, recombinant Lcd1 binds to single- and double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides and is necessary for Mec1 to bind DNA (21Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 857-869Google Scholar). In addition, ChIP analyses have shown a requirement for Lcd1 in the recruitment of Mec1 to HO endonuclease-induced double-stranded breaks as well as cdc13–1-induced lesions, suggesting Lcd1 is required in vivo (21Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 857-869Google Scholar). However, in contrast to Rad3-independent Rad26 damage-induced foci formation, another study has shown that Mec1 is required for the formation of Lcd1 foci at HO endonuclease-induced breaks (22Melo J.A. Cohen J. Toczyski D.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2809-2821Google Scholar).Recently, the putative human homolog of Rad26 and Lcd1, ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein) was identified, and like ATR, its function is required for the cellular response to DNA damage and replication stress (23Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Google Scholar). Similar to its homologs in yeast, ATRIP is phosphorylated by ATR and colocalizes with ATR in cells treated with DNA damaging agents. Recent studies have shown that the single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA (replication protein A) is necessary for the in vitro binding of ATRIP to DNA and that loss of RPA prevents the formation of ATR and ATRIP foci in mammalian cells treated with ionizing radiation (24Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Google Scholar). The ATR kinase activity has also been shown to affect ATR and RPA translocation following ionizing radiation, suggesting that ATR may be necessary for RPA binding to damaged DNA (25Barr S.M. Leung C.G. Chang E.E. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1047-1051Google Scholar).We have developed an in vitro DNA binding assay to study the interaction of ATR and ATRIP with DNA. Using this assay, we show that ATR and ATRIP exist in a large molecular weight complex that is able to bind DNA after significant purification. Interestingly, this ATR-ATRIP complex can bind ssDNA in the absence of RPA; although, as previously reported, we also find that RPA is necessary for the binding of a distinct ATR-ATRIP complex to DNA at higher salt concentrations (24Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Google Scholar). We have further characterized the lower affinity, RPA-independent mode of binding and found that purified ATR and ATRIP are unable to bind DNA either alone or together. This finding indicates that an additional as of yet unidentified protein is required for the in vitro DNA binding of this ATR-ATRIP complex. Our data also indicate that ATR is necessary for the interaction of ATRIP with DNA in this RPA-independent mode. Together, these results suggest that there are two distinct modes for the interaction of the ATR-ATRIP complex with DNA in vitro, one that is RPA-dependent and one that is RPA-independent but requires an unknown protein activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Antibodies—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cell pellets were purchased from the National Cell Culture Center. The FLAG M5 antibody and M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma), Myc 9E10 antibody (Santa Cruz), human ORC2 antibody (BD Bioscience), and human RPA AB3 antibody (Oncogene) were purchased from commercial sources. The antibody to insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) was a gift from Dr. Richard Roth. The human ATR antibody was described previously (5Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Google Scholar). Anti-human ATRIP antibody used for immunodepletion was generated at a commercial facility (Josman, Napa, CA) using GST-ATRIP 1–107 as described (23Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Google Scholar), and the ATRIP antibody used for Western blotting was a gift of Dr. Stephen Elledge.Extract Preparation—To prepare whole cell extracts, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in modified TGN buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Tween 20, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm NaF, Na3VO4, PMSF, DTT, leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) and cleared by centrifugation (10 min, 16,000 × g). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar) and dialyzed into Buffer D (20 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF) containing 100 mm KCl (D100).Subcellular Fractionation and Purification—Subcellular fractionations were performed as described (27Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Google Scholar) with slight modification. For micrococcal nuclease digestion, nuclei from 5 × 106 293T cells were washed and resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO3, protease inhibitors) with 1 mm CaCl2 then digested with 1 unit of micrococcal nuclease (Sigma) and incubated for 2 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 1 mm EGTA.For sucrose gradients, extracts were layered over a 5–30% sucrose gradient in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4 and centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 3 h in a TLS-55 rotor (Beckman). Sizing markers β-amylase (200 kDa) and thyroglobulin (670 kDa) (Sigma) were run in parallel.Partial purification of the ATR-ATRIP complex was carried out using Amersham Biosciences resins, columns and an AKTA explorer FPLC. HeLa nuclear extract (25 mg) was precipitated with addition of solid NH2SO4 to 40% w/v on ice over 30 min with stirring followed by centrifugation at 16000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in half the original volume with buffer E (20 mm Hepes-NaOH pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF) containing 150 mm NaCl (E150), incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 16000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (2 ml) was applied to a S-300 column equilibrated in E150. Fractions containing ATR-ATRIP were pooled, diluted 2-fold in buffer E with no salt (E0) and applied to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer E containing 100 mm NaCl (E100). ATR and ATRIP were eluted with a 100 mm to 400 mm NaCl gradient, pooled, and applied to a heparin-Sepharose HP column equilibrated with buffer E containing 200 mm NaCl (E200). A 200–800 mm NaCl gradient was used to elute proteins from heparin. Fractions containing ATR and ATRIP were pooled and diluted 4-fold with E0, applied to ssDNA cellulose (Sigma) equilibrated with E100 and eluted with buffer E containing 400 mm NaCl. Sizing markers β-amylase (200 kDa) and thyroglobulin (670 kDa) (Sigma) were used to calibrate the S-300 column.DNA Binding Analysis—Nuclear extracts were applied to the ssDNA cellulose (Sigma) column equilibrated with buffer D containing 100 mm NaCl or 100 mm KCl as indicated. Column flow-through was re-applied once prior to washing. Proteins were eluted with buffer D containing 400 mm salt. Any protein remaining bound after this elution was eluted with 10% SDS. DNA binding experiments with purified proteins in Fig. 2 were performed in 10 mm Tris pH 8.0, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF using the indicated salt (24Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Google Scholar). When indicated, an aliquot of ssDNA cellulose was equilibrated with buffer A containing 1 mm CaCl2 and digested with micrococcal nuclease. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 mm EGTA and the column was equilibrated in buffer D containing 100 mm salt.Transfection and Affinity Purification—Transfection of human 293T cells was performed with Fugene-6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For affinity purification, whole cell extract derived from 1 × 108 cells lysed in modified TGN buffer was mixed with 20 μl of M2 resin for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed sequentially with the same buffer, 100 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5 containing 0.5 m LiCl, and D100. Activity of FATR was assessed using an in vitro kinase assay (28Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Google Scholar) with 0.5 μg of GST-Rad17 peptide substrate (29Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37538-37543Google Scholar). FLAG proteins were eluted with equal volume of D100 containing 250 μg/ml FLAG tripeptide (Sigma), 0.05% Tween 20, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 30 min. Three consecutive eluents were pooled and used for DNA binding. RPA was purified as described previously (30Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Google Scholar).RESULTSATR and ATRIP Associate with Chromatin—Previous reports have shown that ATR is a nuclear protein that binds to chromatin even in the absence of external genotoxic stress (13Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Google Scholar). In order to assess whether ATRIP can also associate with chromatin, subcellular fractionation was performed as previously described (27Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Google Scholar). Exponentially growing 293T cells were collected and fractionated into three different parts: the cytoplasmic fraction (S1), the soluble nuclear fraction (S2), and the chromatin-enriched fraction (P2). Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a soluble cytoplasmic protein, and ORC2, a chromatin-binding protein that is a subunit of the origin recognition complex, were readily separated into their appropriate fractions using this protocol. As previously reported, ATR was found in the chromatin-enriched fraction (P2) as well as those fractions containing cytoplasmic and soluble nuclear proteins (Fig. 1A). ATRIP distributed to the same fractions as ATR (Fig. 1A), and its distribution did not change significantly in response to genotoxic stress (data not shown). Importantly, treatment of the chromatin-enriched fraction (P2) with micrococcal nuclease led to release of ATR, ATRIP, and ORC2 to the soluble nuclear fraction (S2), suggesting that both ATR and ATRIP associate specifically with chromatin.Fig. 1ATR and ATRIP bind chromatin and ssDNA cellulose. A, exponentially growing 293T cells were collected and fractionated into cytoplasmic (S1), nuclear soluble (S2), and nuclear insoluble (P2) fractions or a whole cell extract (WCE) of the total protein was prepared. A portion of the nuclear insoluble fraction (P2) was treated with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to release chromatin-bound proteins into the S2 fraction. Proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and detected by blotting with the indicated antibodies. B, a nuclear extract (200 μg) prepared from HeLa cells was loaded onto a 200 μl ssDNA cellulose column that had been either mock-treated (top two panels) or previously treated with MNase (bottom two panels) followed by equilibration in buffer D containing 100 mm salt. Columns were washed sequentially with buffer D containing 100 mm and then 400 mm salt. Load (L), flow-through (FT), and eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted with the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)ATR and ATRIP Bind DNA in Vitro—Our data show that ATR and ATRIP are both able to bind chromatin in vivo, suggesting that these proteins may also interact with DNA in vitro. To test this possibility, we assessed the ability of both proteins to interact with ssDNA cellulose. Using HeLa nuclear extract as a source of ATR and ATRIP, we found that both ATR and ATRIP can bind ssDNA cellulose with the majority of both proteins eluting at 400 mm NaCl (Fig. 1B, top panel). A gradient from 100 mm to 1 m NaCl revealed that this elution began to occur at 200 mm NaCl, and similar results were obtained with nuclear extracts prepared from 293T or HCT116 cells (data not shown). To test the specificity of binding, we treated the ssDNA cellulose with micrococcal nuclease prior to addition of HeLa nuclear extract. Both ATR and ATRIP were unable to bind to the micrococcal nuclease-treated DNA cellulose (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Together, these results indicate that native, unpurified ATR and ATRIP can bind ssDNA.ATRIP Binds DNA in an RPA-dependent and -independent Manner—Recent studies using extracts from the eggs of Xenopus laevis implicate RPA in the association of ATR with poly(dA) oligonucleotides or with sperm chromatin (31Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Google Scholar, 32Costanzo V. Shechter D. Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A. Gottesman M. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 203-213Google Scholar), and studies with purified proteins also indicate that RPA is required for the association of human ATRIP with single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (24Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Google Scholar). Therefore, we directly tested the requirement for RPA in the binding of ATR and ATRIP to ssDNA cellulose. To do so, a HeLa nuclear extract was first passed over a ssDNA cellulose column and bound proteins were eluted with sequential washes of 400 mm NaCl buffer and 10% SDS. Consistent with previous reports that RPA requires at least 2 m NaCl for elution (33Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Google Scholar), we found that RPA remained tightly bound to the column and was eluted only with 10% SDS (Fig. 2A, column 1). Although ATR and ATRIP eluted at 400 mm NaCl as before, we did find that a small fraction remained bound to ssDNA and eluted with RPA (Fig. 2A, column 1, last lane). We then reapplied the ATR and ATRIP that eluted with 400 mm NaCl to a second ssDNA cellulose column equilibrated to 100 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were again eluted sequentially with 400 mm NaCl and 10% SDS. Interestingly, we found that the ATR and ATRIP in these RPA-depleted fractions were still able to bind ssDNA cellulose (Fig. 2A, column 2). These results suggest that the ATR-ATRIP complex that elutes from ssDNA cellulose at 400 mm NaCl does not require RPA to bind to DNA in vitro.One explanation for this observation that would reconcile it with previous reports is that there are distinct ATR-ATRIP complexes that can bind DNA in an RPA-dependent and RPA-independent manner. To more directly test for the presence of multiple ATR-ATRIP ssDNA binding complexes in vitro, we compared the ability of RPA to reconstitute the binding of affinity-purified FLAG-tagged ATRIP (FATRIP) (Fig. 2B) and/or FATR (data not shown). Consistent with the results of Zou and Elledge (24Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Google Scholar) who used ssDNA oligonucleotides, when ATRIP alone was incubated with ssDNA cellulose in a similar buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”), none was able to bind DNA (Fig. 2B, top panel). However, inclusion of RPA with ATRIP led to the recruitment of some ATRIP to ssDNA. Although this population of ATRIP did not elute at 400 mm NaCl, it could be eluted with 10% SDS (Fig. 2B, middle panel). In contrast, when ATRIP was incubated with HeLa nuclear extract, two populations of ATRIP DNA binding could be observed, one of which eluted at 400 mm NaCl and the other with 10% SDS (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). This suggests that recombinant ATRIP is properly folded and that the HeLa nuclear extract provides another activity that is necessary for the interaction of ATRIP with ssDNA. Taken together, these observations indicate that two distinct ATR-ATRIP DNA binding modes exist, a high affinity mode that requires RPA for binding and a lower affinity mode that does not require RPA for binding.ATR and ATRIP Are Part of a Large Molecular Weight DNA Binding Complex—It is possible that the dual modes of ATR-ATRIP DNA binding in vitro represent multiple complexes in vivo. ATR has been reported to exist in a large molecular weight complex (34Wright J.A. Keegan K.S. Herendeen D.R. Bentley N.J. Carr A.M. Hoekstra M.F. Concannon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7445-7450Google Scholar), and previous immunoprecipitation studies show that ATRIP interacts with ATR (23Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Google Scholar). To determine if ATRIP is also in the large ATR complex, HeLa nuclear lysates were fractionated by sucrose gradient sedimentation and size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3, A and C). ATRIP and ATR were found in the same fractions using both techniques. Furthermore, the size distribution of ATR and ATRIP did not appear to change upon DNA damage, inhibition of replication, or DNase I treatment (data not shown). Importantly, RPA did not copurify with ATR and ATRIP by either technique suggesting it is not part of the ATR-ATRIP complex.Fig. 3ATR and ATRIP are in a large molecular weight DNA binding complex. A, HeLa nuclear extract (L) (100 μg) was loaded onto a 5–30% sucrose density gradient and centrifuged for 3 h at 55,000 rpm. Fractions were taken from the top of the gradient, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by blotting with the antibodies indicated. Molecular weight markers are shown. B, schematic of partial purification of HeLa nuclear extract. Fractions from the S-300 gel filtration column (C) and ssDNA cellulose column (D) used in the purification are shown. S-300 column void volume (Vo) and standard molecular weight markers are indicated. Fractions were collected and separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted with the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We also assessed the ability of ATR and ATRIP to bind ssDNA cellulose after further purification. Purification of HeLa nuclear extracts by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by sequential fractionation on gel filtration (S-300), Q Sepharose and heparin Sepharose columns revealed that ATR and ATRIP copurify through multiple steps (Fig. 3, B and C and data not shown). Moreover, this complex retains the ability to bind ssDNA cellulose (Fig. 3D) in the absence of RPA. Overall, these results strongly suggest that ATR and ATRIP, but not RPA, are part of the same large molecular weight complex that elutes from ssDNA at 400 mm salt. Henceforth, the ATR-ATRIP complex that binds ssDNA independently of RPA will also be referred to as the low affinity DNA binding complex.ATR and ATRIP Are Not Sufficient to Bind ssDNA Cellulose—The results shown above indicate that ATR and ATRIP can associate with DNA both in vitro and in vivo, but it is not clear if ATR and ATRIP in the low affinity DNA binding complex interact directly with DNA or if additional proteins are required to mediate their interaction. Studies in S. cerevisiae have shown that the putative ATRIP homolog Lcd1/Ddc2 can bind directly to ssDNA in vitro and can facilitate the interaction of Mec1 with DNA (21Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 857-869Google Scholar). Thus, one possibility is that ATRIP is the factor that mediates the interaction of ATR with DNA independently of RPA. In contrast with Ldc1/Ddc2, however, baculovirus-expressed affinity-purified FATRIP did not bind to ssDNA cellulose (Fig. 2B, top panel and 4A, top panel). Similar results were observed using affinity-purified FATRIP expressed in mammalian 293T cells (data not shown).In order to assess whether ATR itself can bind DNA directly, we first expressed FLAG-tagged ATR (FATR) in mammalian 293T cells. Prior to purification, both wild-type and kinase-inactive versions of FATR in a nuclear extract prepared from 293T cells bound to ssDNA cellulose and eluted under the same conditions observed for endogenous ATR (Fig. 6A, top right panel and data not shown). However, when FATR was affinity purified and then applied to ssDNA cellulose, we found that the majority of the purified FATR, like FATRIP, could not bind to DNA (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). The ability of affinity-purified FATR to undergo autophosphorylation (data not shown) and to phosphorylate a GST-Rad17 substrate peptide (29Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37538-37543Google Scholar) suggests that the purified ATR is active as a kinase and is properly folded (Fig. 4B). Thus, these results suggest that ATR, like ATRIP, does not bind directly to ssDNA cellulose.Fig. 6ATR is necessary for ATRIP to form a large molecular weight complex that can bind DNA. A, nuclear extracts (100 μg) prepared from 293T cells expressing FATR (top panel), mycATRIP (second panel), or FATR and mycATRIP (bottom panels) were applied to 100-μl ssDNA cellulose columns.

We have previously shown that human Aβ has the ability to reduce Fe(III) and Cu(II) and produce hydrogen peroxide coupled with these metals, which is correlated with toxicity against primary neuronal cells. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression is linked to the progression and severity of pathology in AD. COX is a heme-containing enzyme that produces prostaglandins, and the enzyme also possesses peroxidase activity. Here we investigated the possibility of direct interaction between human Aβ and COX-2 being mediated by the peroxidase activity. Human Aβ formed dimers when it was reacted with COX-2 and hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, the peptide formed a cross-linked complex directly with COX-2. Such cross-linking was not observed with rat Aβ, and the sole tyrosine residue specific for human Aβ might therefore be the site of cross-linking. Similar complexes of Aβ and COX-2 were detected in post-mortem brain samples in greater amounts in AD tissue than in age-matched controls. COX-2-mediated cross-linking may inhibit Aβ catabolism and possibly generate toxic intracellular forms of oligomeric Aβ. Oxidative stress is associated with the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease.

COX harnesses two enzymatic activities to produce prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). Authentic “cyclooxygenase” activity first converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), and subsequent peroxidase activity reduces PGG2 to PGH2. The peroxidase reaction of COX is analogous to that of HRP and can utilize a wide range of hydroperoxides including H2O2, rather than PGG2, as substrates (15Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar). We suspected that the peroxidase activity of COX-2 might induce the formation of Aβ oligomers. To explore this possibility, we examined the effect of COX-2 on Aβ oligomerization and report the formation of Aβ-COX-2 complexes in vitro and in vivo.

The peptide preparation was then filtered through a Spin-X cellulose acetate filter unit (0.22 μm; Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY). Concentrations of Aβ were determined by BCA assay (Pierce), which we have previously validated as an assay for Aβ concentration (53Huang X. Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Hartshorn M.A. Vonsattel J.-P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26464-26470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Aβ was incubated with ovine COX-2 in a final volume of 100 μl of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium at 37 °C. Stock solutions of indomethacin (50 mm), ibuprofen (250 mm), and aspirin (250 mm) were prepared in ethanol. Where COX-2 inhibitors were used, the enzyme was preincubated with the reagent for 30 min on ice. For chemical modification of amino acids in Aβ, the peptide was incubated with the reagent for 30 min at 25 °C prior to adding COX-2 and hydrogen peroxide. The reaction was terminated by adding sample buffer for SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitation—Solutions reacted in vitro were incubated with 2 μl of anti-COX-2 antibody overnight at 4 °C and with 30 μl of MagnaBind anti-rabbit IgG beads for 1 h at 4 °C subsequently. For co-immunoprecipitation of Aβ or COX-2 from tissue, control and AD brain samples were homogenized by a glass homogenizer in 10 ml/g of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The supernatant was separated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min and adjusted to a final protein concentration of 1.75 mg/ml with homogenization buffer. After pretreatment with 10 μl of MagnaBind beads to decrease the nonspecific binding of proteins, the supernatant (0.8 ml) was incubated with 3 μl of anti-Aβ (W0–2) or COX-2 antibody overnight at 4 °C and subsequently with 30 μl of MagnaBind beads for 3 h at 4 °C. For Western blot, the precipitates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C with sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Immunoblotting—The samples in sample buffer were loaded onto a NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel and separated by electrophoresis at 200 V for 45 min. The gel was then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) at 75 mA for 90 min. The membrane was blocked with 10% dry milk, 5% bovine serum albumin for anti-Aβ antibodies or 5% dry milk for anti-COX-2 antibody for 1 h at 25 °C. The membrane was then incubated with a primary antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at 25 °C. Antibody labeling was detected by LumiGLO chemiluminescent kit (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The density of each band from the immunoblotting was analyzed by National Institutes of Health Image 1.62 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). To study the effects of COX-2 on the oligomerization of Aβ, we incubated purified ovine COX-2 (140 nm) with human synthetic Aβ 1–40 (“h40,” 2.5 μm) in the presence of H2O2 (1 μm) for 2hat37 °C. We observed that the synthetic Aβ alone remained predominantly monomeric upon SDS-PAGE but that the combination of COX-2 and H2O2 induced the conspicuous formation of an apparent Aβ dimer, as well as Aβ immunoreactive bands in the range of 50–75 kDa (Fig. 1A). Incubation of Aβ with COX-2 alone induced far lower amounts of the apparent dimer and higher molecular weight Aβ immunoreactive products, but because the incubation was performed under aerobic conditions, small concentrations of H2O2 may have been present because of the reduction and subsequent disproportionation of dissolved O2 (26Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4577) Google Scholar). This interpretation was indeed supported by the experimental effects of the H2O2 scavenger catalase, which completely abolished all but monomeric Aβ immunoreactivity being detected upon co-incubation with Aβ, COX-2, and H2O2 (Fig. 1A). Aβ incubated with H2O2 alone remained monomeric on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). These data established that H2O2 acts in concert with COX-2 to convert monomeric Aβ into apparent dimeric and higher molecular weight Aβ immunoreactive products. Me2SO and mannitol, which scavenge OH·¯, did not have an inhibitory effect on the generation of these modified Aβ immunoreactivities (Fig. 1A), suggesting that H2O2 in the reaction is not inducing cross-linking through Fenton or Haber-Weiss chemistry. As a positive control, we also applied human Aβ reacted with horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide, which is known to induce dimeric dityrosine cross-linking of human Aβ (DT-Aβ) (13Galeazzi L. Ronchi P. Franceschi C. Giunta S. Amyloid. 1999; 6: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). DT-Aβ co-migrated with the apparent Aβ dimers that we observed, and HRP, like COX-2 incubated under the same conditions, also appeared to form Aβ adducts (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that hydrogen peroxide might oxidize residues of both the COX-2- and Aβ-inducing covalent cross-links, consistent with DT interstrand bridge formation for Aβ to Aβ and Aβ to COX-2. Alzheimer neuropathology is only seen in animal species that have the human sequence of Aβ (27Johnstone E.M. Chaney M.O. Norris F.H. Pascual R. Little S.P. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 10: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and not in rats and mice, which have three amino acid substitutions (Arg5 → Gly, Tyr10 → Phe, and His13 → Arg) (28Shivers B.D. Hilbich C. Multhaup G. Salbaum M. Beyreuther K. Seeburg P.H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1365-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The tyrosine substitution in the rat/mouse Aβ (“rat Aβ”) abolishes the possibility of DT interstrand bridge formation. To explore further whether COX-2 induces DT interstrand bridge formation, we repeated the experiment comparing the products of rat Aβ to human Aβ (Fig. 1B). Although incubation with COX-2/H2O2 (but not H2O2 alone) induced apparent dimer formation of human Aβ 1–40 as well as high molecular weight immunoreactivity, no such modifications of rat Aβ 1–40 were apparent even after 15 h of incubation (Fig. 1B). The molecular mass of COX-2 is ≈70 kDa, and we determined that COX-2 itself did not cross-react with 4G8 antibody (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the Aβ immunoreactive band at ≈75 kDa when synthetic human Aβ was reacted with COX-2 and hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1, A and B, asterisk) may indeed be a complex of human Aβ and COX-2. To confirm that this ≈75-kDa Aβ immunoreactivity reflects Aβ complex formation with COX-2, we immunoprecipitated the incubation products with a polyclonal anti-COX-2 antibody and immunoblotted the immunoprecipitates with anti-Aβ antibody (WO2). We again observed the 75-kDa band from the sample of human Aβ1–40 reacted with COX-2 and hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2, arrow) but not from the samples of COX-2, human Aβ1–40 alone, or rat Aβ1–40 incubated with COX-2 and hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, human Aβ may have adducted onto the COX-2 in this reaction. In addition, an extra band at ≈50 kDa was seen only in the precipitate from the sample of human Aβ with COX-2 and hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2, arrowhead), which may be a complex of human Aβ with a degraded COX-2 fragment. We next examined the effects of several peroxidase inhibitors on the cross-linking (Fig. 3A). Desferroxamine, an iron chelator, inhibited the apparent cross-linking completely, possibly by complexing iron from heme in COX-2. Sodium azide and sodium cyanide, inhibitors of peroxidase, also attenuated the cross-linking. The inhibition was more complete with cyanide compared with azide at the same concentration. NSAIDs and aspirin were examined for effects on these peroxidative reactions (Fig. 3B). Indomethacin and ibuprofen, nonspecific inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2, potently attenuated the apparent cross-linking of Aβ mediated by COX-2/H2O2. Aspirin, a more potent inhibitor of COX-1, had a lesser effect compared with the other inhibitors. Inactivation of COX-2 by heating at 95 °C for 10 min abolished Aβ cross-linking (Fig. 3B), which excludes the possibility that iron in free heme itself might cause the cross-linking of Aβ by Fenton chemistry. Therefore, the oligomerization is caused by the enzymatic peroxidase activity of COX-2. Arg5, Tyr10, and His13 in human Aβ1–40 are substituted in rat Aβ1–40, which did not polymerize in the presence of COX-2 (Fig. 1B). Therefore, one of these three residues may be the site of dimeric cross-linking induced by COX-2/H2O2. As a preliminary analysis to identify the amino acid responsible for the cross-linking, we examined the effect of chemical modifiers for each amino acid (29Brzyska M. Bacia A. Elbaum D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3443-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) on the apparent cross-linking induced by COX-2/H2O2 (Fig. 3C). Phenylglyoxal, an arginine modifier, did not have an apparent effect. N-Acetylimidazole, which acetylates tyrosine hydroxyl groups, partially inhibited the apparent cross-linking consistent with inhibiting the formation of dityrosine bridges. Diethylpyrocarbonate, a histidine modifier, did not inhibit the cross-linking but rather promoted the oligomerization of Aβ. This result may indicate that the histidine residues play a role in minimizing radical reactivity or that the diethylpyrocarbonate is acting exceptionally in this system as a chemical cross-linker. Among the caveats with this approach is that the modifications are not completely selective for amino acids. Although future studies of amino acid substituted Aβ will be needed to consolidate these conclusions, these findings do not refute our earlier interpretation (Figs. 1 and 3, A and B) that DT cross-linking could be a consequence of the peroxidative activity of COX-2. We next explored for evidence that COX-2 might react with Aβ in vivo. There is already abundant evidence for SDS-resistant Aβ dimers and polymers being enriched in AD-affected post-mortem brain tissue (2Masters C.L. Multhaup G. Simms G. Pottgiesser J. Martins R.N. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2757-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 30Kuo Y.M. Emmerling M.R. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Kasunic T.C. Kirkpatrick J.B. Murdoch G.H. Ball M.J. Roher A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4077-4081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is evidence of elevated H2O2 in AD-affected brain tissue (4Smith M.A. Perry G. Richey P.L. Sayre L.M. Anderson V.E. Beal M.F. Kowall N. Nature. 1996; 382: 120-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Our in vitro data indicated that whenever the combination of COX-2 and H2O2 induced Aβ apparent dimeric cross-linking, a proportion of Aβ always adducted to COX-2 itself (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Therefore, if COX-2 indeed contributed to Aβ oligomeric cross-linking in vivo, the presence of such Aβ-COX-2 complexes would be anticipated in post mortem human brain tissue as a biomarker. We investigated this possibility by co-immunoprecipitation of AD and age-matched control post-mortem human brain tissue with anti-Aβ and COX-2 antibodies, as in Fig. 1B. Two major bands were seen at approximately 70 and 50 kDa that were cross-immunoreactive with both antibodies (Fig. 4A). These bands were close to the molecular masses of the two major bands detected in anti-COX-2 immunoprecipitation of human Aβ1–40 incubated with ovine COX-2 and H2O2, detected by Aβ immunoblot (Fig. 1B). Again, the 50-kDa band might be a degraded fragment of the complex possibly formed by the attack of free radicals. As a further negative control, we also probed these blots with antibody against human copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, which is widely expressed in the brain, and no immunoreactivity was detected (data not shown). We surveyed the relative abundance of Aβ-COX-2 complexes in post-mortem human brain samples obtained from patients with AD and age-matched controls. In moderately affected AD, Aβ-COX-2 complexes were significantly increased compared with age-matched controls (p < 0.05, paired t test; Fig. 4B) in the COX-2 blot following Aβ immunoprecipitation but not in Aβ blots following COX-2 immunoprecipitation. The increase Aβ-COX-2 complexes was more conspicuous in severely affected AD, where both COX-2 and Aβ blots revealed greater amounts of the immunoprecipitated complexes (p < 0.05, paired t test). This indicates that the Aβ-COX-2 complexes become more abundant as the disease progresses. Our data indicate that the peroxidative activity of COX-2 induces the dimerization of human Aβ by a H2O2-mediated mechanism, and the enzyme itself also cross-links with human Aβ directly. These cross-links were attenuated by a scavenger of H2O2 and by peroxidase inhibitors. Our evidence, for the first time, implicates COX-2 activity in the direct oxidation of Aβ, to generate SDS-resistant oligomeric Aβ forms that resemble forms that have previously been reported to be increased in the disease and proposed to mediate pathophysiology. Aβ is extracted from AD brains as toxic water-soluble, SDS-resistant oligomers (30Kuo Y.M. Emmerling M.R. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Kasunic T.C. Kirkpatrick J.B. Murdoch G.H. Ball M.J. Roher A.E. J. Biol.

Soluble Aβ levels, including the SDS-resistant oligomers, are correlated to the disease severity of AD (32McLean C. Cherny R. Fraser F. Fuller S. Smith M. Beyreuther K. Bush A. Masters C. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Diffusible Aβ oligomers are deleterious to hippocampal neurons in vitro (33Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C.

Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). Recent data have proposed that Aβ oligomers are generated intracellularly and secreted subsequently to form extracellular amyloid fibrils (35Walsh D.M. Tseng B.P. Rydel R.E. Podlisny M.B. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10831-10839Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that the subcellular origin of these oligomers may be microsomes (35Walsh D.M. Tseng B.P. Rydel R.E. Podlisny M.B. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10831-10839Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), the same compartment that contains COX. To date, none of the reports correlating SDS-resistant apparent oligomers of Aβ with neurotoxicity have established the basis of the SDS resistance. Aβ will form SDS-resistant oligomers to some extent in the absence of any apparent oxidative modification (Fig. 3A). However, our data establish that oxidation will lead to an apparent covalent cross-link that leads to similar SDS resistance. The possibility that oxidized Aβ SDS-resistant oligomers (e.g. produced by COX-2 activity) are more neurotoxic than the nonoxidized oligomers must be considered. COX possesses both cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities. The cycle of the peroxidase reaction can occur independently of cyclooxygenase activity, utilizing hydroperoxides such as hydrogen peroxide (15Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar). During the peroxidase reaction, ferric heme of the resting enzyme is oxidized to form ferryl iron and a porphyrin radical (Intermediate I). The porphyrin radical is reduced to form a tyrosyl radical at Tyr385 by an intramolecular electron transfer (Intermediate II). In the presence of reducing co-substrates, Intermediates I and II are returned to resting state (36Tsai A. Kulmacz R.J.

The trafficking of VAChT has been most thoroughly studied in PC12 cells where it is believed to involve a multistep process. It has been proposed, although not proven, that VAChT, along with synaptophysin (7Régnier-Vigouroux A. Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3589-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), is trafficked from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane via the constitutive secretory pathway, then from the plasma membrane to an endosomal compartment, and finally from the endosomal compartment to SLMVs (6Eiden L.E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2227-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Membrane trafficking between organelles of the endocytic and secretory pathways is mediated by transport vesicles that shuttle between different compartments. Both the generation of transport vesicles and the selection of protein cargo for inclusion in these vesicles are dependent on the function of coat proteins attached to the cytosolic face of the appropriate membrane (8Rothman J.E.

Clathrin-coated vesicles represent the best characterized system of membrane protein trafficking in eukaryotic cells. The major components of clathrin-coated vesicles are clathrin and adaptor protein (AP) complexes. Clathrin provides the structural component while the adaptor protein complexes select the vesicle cargo and promote clathrin-lattice formation onto the respective membrane (11Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. J.

There are five known adaptor protein complexes associated with clathrin; adaptor proteins 1 through 4 (AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, and AP-4) and adaptor protein 180 (AP-180). The AP-1 complexes are associated with the TGN and are involved in the transport of proteins to the endosomal/lysosomal system and to the cell surface. AP-2 complexes are found at the plasma membrane and participate in the internalization of cell surface proteins (12Keen J.H. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2787-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Selection of cargo membrane proteins by adaptor protein complexes is dependent on a “sorting signal,” usually located in a cytoplasmic domain of the cargo membrane protein. There are two known sorting signals for interaction with clathrin-coated vesicles, a tyrosine-based sorting signal, YXXØ or NPXY (where X is any amino acid and Ø is a large hydrophobic amino acid (leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, methionine, valine) and the dileucine-based sorting signal. Both AP-1 and AP-2 have been found to recognize tyrosine-based and dileucine-based sorting signals (26Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 497-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). AP-3 can also recognize the dileucine-sorting motif (28Vowels J.J. Payne G.S.

It is believed that at least two different sorting machineries are necessary for the trafficking of newly synthesized VAChT from the TGN to its final destination on the synaptic vesicle. Sorting from the TGN to the plasma membrane is suggested to involve the constitutive secretory pathway, and would not require a special sorting system. However, endocytosis from the plasma membrane to an endosomal compartment and intracellular trafficking from the endosomal compartment to synaptic vesicles likely require sorting machineries. Although there is evidence that clathrin-mediated endocytosis contributes to the sorting of VAChT in PC12 cells, the steps and pathway underlying the sorting and trafficking of newly synthesized transporter has yet to be determined. We now report on the identification of clathrin-coated vesicles that are involved in VAChT trafficking. DNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—A cDNA corresponding to the 60 amino acid cytoplasmic carboxyl tail of VAChT (residues 471–530), VAChTCTD, was generated by PCR and subcloned into the EcoR1/NotI restriction sites of the bacterial expression vector pGEX5X-3 by adding appropriate restriction sites to the PCR primers. Wild-type rat VAChT, subcloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pBluescript KS+ (Invitrogen), was used as a template for mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen). To prepare deletion mutants a stop codon was inserted at the appropriate site of the mutagenic primer. To verify that only the desired mutation was introduced, the mutated portion was sequenced by the ThermoSequenase Radiolabeled Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length mutant VAChTs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 or pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and the 60 amino acid cytoplasmic carboxyl tail of mutant VAChT was subcloned into pGEX5X-3. Cell Culture and Preparation of Stable Transfectants—PC12 cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 media containing l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.45% glucose, 10% horse serum, 5% bovine calf serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Electroporation was used for transfection of wild type and mutant VAChT cDNAs into PC12 cells. For electroporation, cells were detached from plates with trypsin/EDTA, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 800 μl of cold PBS at a cell density of ∼6 × 107 cells/ml. The resuspended cells were mixed with 50 μg of plasmid DNA. After a 10-min incubation on ice, the cell-DNA mixture was transferred to a 0.4-cm gap cuvette (Bio-Rad), electroporated (0.2 kV, 975 microfarads) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II, then replated in culture media and cultured for 48–72 h. Stable transformants were selected with 0.5 mg/ml of Geneticin (Invitrogen) or 0.5 mg/ml of Zeocin (Invitrogen). GST Fusion Protein Production and in Vitro Binding Assays—Wild type and mutant VAChT cytoplasmic tail constructs in pGEX5X-3 were transformed into E. coli BL21. 5 ml of bacteria, grown overnight in LB media containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin was transferred to 500 ml of 2× YT media (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) containing ampicillin and cultured at 37 °C an additional 3–5 h until the OD600 reached 0.5–0.7. Protein expression was then induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) for 1–2 h at 27 °C. After induction bacteria were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in cold PBS containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Bacteria were disrupted with a French Pressure Cell at 500–1000 p.s.i. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting bacterial lysate was either used immediately or stored at -80 °C until use. GST fusion proteins were purified by incubation with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by washing with cold PBS. In most experiments the fusion proteins were not eluted from the beads. The amount of bound fusion protein was quantitated with an aliquot after elution from the beads with Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce). Rat brain extracts were prepared by homogenization of frozen rat brain (Pel-Freez Biologicals) using a Potter-Elvejhem homogenizer by several up and down strokes in Cytosol Buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7, 125 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% glucose) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 10 mm EDTA, and 0.1% of CHAPS. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min and the resulting supernatant used immediately. In vitro interaction assays were performed by incubating 40 μl of glutathione agarose beads containing ∼10 μg of bound GST fusion protein with 1 ml (2 mg) of rat brain homogenate for 14 h at 4 °C. After binding, beads were washed five times in cytosol buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were then eluted with SDS gel loading buffer (62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5% SDS, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Monoclonal antibodies against adaptin α, adaptin γ, and β-NAP (Transduction Laboratories) and AP-180 (Sigma) were used to detect AP-2, AP-1, AP-3, and AP-180 complexes, respectively. Preparation of Postnuclear Supernatants—Postnuclear supernatants were prepared as described in Kim et al. (31Kim M.H. Lu M. Lim E.J. Chai Y.G. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells were trypsinized and rinsed with ice-cold PBS containing 10 mm EDTA. Cell pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 4% protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspension was homogenized on ice with a Potter-Elvejhem homogenizer by several up and down strokes within a 5-min period. Postnuclear supernatants were then collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration was measured with the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent based on the Bradford method (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation—1 ml of postnuclear supernatant (∼5 mg of total protein) was incubated with the cross-linking reagent 3,3-dithiobis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)propionate (DTSSP) at 5 mm for2hat4 °C. After cross-linking, 100 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added and insoluble material removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation. The cell lysate was first precleared with 30 μl of protein G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C, then incubated with anti-VAChT antibody for 1 h, and then for an additional hour after adding protein G-agarose. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with homogenization buffer supplemented with 100 mm NaCl and 1% Nonidet P-40. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Organelle Immunoisolation—Post-nuclear supernatants (500 μl containing ∼250 μg of total protein) derived from wild type or mutant VAChT transfected PC12 cells were precleared with 10 μl of mouse preimmune serum and 10 μl of Dynabeads® M-450 (Dynal ASA, Oslo, Norway) for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared post nuclear supernatant was incubated with 2 μg of monoclonal antibody to synaptophysin (Chemicon) for 1 h at 4 °C. Dynabeads® M-450 (25 μl bed volume) conjugated to rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Dynal ASA) was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C followed by four washes in homogenization buffer. The immunoisolated vesicles were then extracted in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western analysis. Cell Fractionation (Linear Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation)—Post-nuclear supernatant (500 μl; ∼5 mg of total protein) was loaded onto a 10-ml linear sucrose gradient from 0.6 to 1.6 m sucrose in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 6 h in an SW40 Ti rotor in a Beckman LE-80 centrifuge at 4 °C. Fractions of 500 μl were collected from the bottom of the tube, 10 μl of each fraction was mixed with 10 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. A mouse monoclonal antibody against synaptophysin (Chemicon) or a rabbit antiserum against secretogranin II was used to detect synaptic-like microvesicles and large dense core vesicles, respectively. The latter antiserum was a generous gift from Dr. Jonathan Scammell, University of Alabama. A goat polyclonal antibody against VAChT (Chemicon) was used. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—For the detection of mutant protein expression, 5 μl of postnuclear supernatant (50 μg of total protein) containing the mutant VAChT was diluted to 500 μl with homogenization buffer and pelleted by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 1 h in a TLA-100–3 rotor using a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon P membrane and blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 10% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was sequentially incubated with primary antibody (goat anti-rVAChT antibody), then with peroxidase-conjugated porcine anti-goat antibody for 1 h each at room temperature. Between each incubation, the blot was washed three times for 10 min with Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20. Immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For immunostaining, cells were plated onto glass coverslips coated with 5 μg/ml laminin (Sigma), fixed for 20 min with cold methanol and blocked in PBS containing 5% bovine calf serum and 5% horse serum. The cells were then incubated with primary antibody in the same buffer for 20 min at room temperature, washed three times, incubated an additional 20 min at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibody in the same buffer, and washed again three times with blocking buffer and three times with PBS. The coverslip were mounted on glass slides with Vectorshield mounting solution. Cells were viewed on a Nikon Eclipse E600 Microscope. To detect the VAChT primary antibody, the secondary antibody was a fluorescein-conjugated sheep anti-goat antibody (Chemicon). For the monoclonal antibody to synaptophysin (Chemicon), Texas red-conjugated bovine anti-mouse antibody (Vector Laboratories) was used. The C-terminal Cytoplasmic Tail of VAChT Interacts with AP Complexes—The cytoplasmic tail of a number of membrane proteins has been shown to contain information for targeting to various intracellular destinations (32Sorkin A. McKinsey T. Shih W. Kirchhausen T. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 619-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 33Shin J. Doyle C. Yang Z. Kappes D.

The VAChT cytoplasmic carboxyl tail fits into this group as it has been shown to be involved in the targeting of this transporter to synaptic vesicles (35Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9094-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This segment of VAChT contains two putative sorting motifs; a dileucine motif preceded by a phosphorylation site and two possible tyrosine-based sorting motifs, Fig. 1A. To analyze for an interaction of the VAChT cytoplasmic tail with adaptor protein (AP) complexes, we initially utilized a fusion protein consisting of the carboxyl cytoplasmic domain of rVAChT fused to GST (GST-VAChTCTD) to pull-down complexes from a rat brain extract. Thus GST-VAChTCTD was mixed with a rat brain extract, precipitated with glutathione agarose, washed, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. The resolved proteins were probed with antisera to adaptin α (a subunit of the AP-2 complex), adaptin γ (a subunit of the AP-1 complex), β-NAP (a subunit of the AP-3 complex), and AP-180. As shown in Fig. 2, adaptin α, adaptin γ and AP-180, but not β-NAP were co-precipitated with GST-VAChTCTD. GST alone did not form any detectable complexes. To confirm the interaction of the VAChT cytoplasmic tail with specific AP complexes we sought to demonstrate the presence of these complexes in vivo. Although PC12 cells express endogenous VAChT mRNA as detected by PCR, VAChT protein expression is too low to be detected by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Therefore, as done in other studies (4Liu Y. Edwards R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9094-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) full-length VAChT was stably transfected into PC12 cells to produce PC12VAChT. In general cargo protein-adaptor protein complex interactions are transient and unstable. A post-nuclear supernatant prepared from PC12VAChT was therefore treated with the homobifunctional cross-linking reagent DTSSP for 2 h at 4 °C to fix complexes. After lysis of the vesicles, samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-VAChT antisera and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. This procedure led to the identification of adaptin α and adaptin γ complexes, Fig. 3. No complexes or VAChT protein were detected with non-transfected PC12 cells, nor was an AP-180 complex detected by this procedure. Since PC12 cells contain far less AP-180 than rat brain (data not shown), this experiment cannot exclude VAChT interacting with AP-180 in neurons. Analysis of VAChT Deletion Mutants—Based on the experiments described above, it was possible to demonstrate that the VAChT C-terminal cytoplasmic tail forms specific AP complexes. We next set out to identify the sequence(s) within the C-terminal tail of VAChT that interacts with each AP complex. As noted above and shown in Fig. 1, VAChT contains both putative dileucine and tyrosine motifs that could be involved in adaptor complex formation. A series of deletion mutants were constructed and are shown in Fig. 1B. The mutant VAChTΔC11 has the most C-terminal putative tyrosine-sorting motif deleted, the mutant VAChTΔC37 has both C-terminal putative tyrosine-sorting motifs deleted, while the mutant VAChTΔC53 has the above deletions plus the dileucine motif and the phosphorylation site deleted. The interaction with adaptin α was essentially eliminated in all of the mutants, even VAChTΔC11, in which the C-terminal 11 amino acids that contain a putative tyrosine motif was deleted. This finding suggests that the C-terminal 11 amino acids contain the AP-2 interaction signal. The adaptin γ interaction was diminished in the VAChTΔC11 and VAChTΔC37 deletion constructs, and was absent in the VAChTΔC53 construct in which the phosphorylation site and the dileucine motif were deleted (Fig. 4). However, all of these mutants exhibited interaction with AP-180 and since together they represent deletion of all but the first 8 amino acids of the C-terminal tail we consider the interaction with AP-180 as being nonspecific. Supporting this suggestion is the finding that a construct in which the first 8 amino acids (residues 471–478) of VAChT were deleted still bound to AP-180. We examined the consequence of eliminating the interaction with adaptin α or adaptin γ by examining the trafficking of these deletion mutants in PC12 cells. Full-length VAChT containing each of the deletion mutants was constructed in the expression vector pcDNA3.1. Since the C-terminal truncations eliminate the epitope recognized by available VAChT antibodies, the hemagglutinin epitope (HA), YPYDVPDYA, was attached to the N-terminal of VAChT for detection purposes. Since the HA epitope contains tyrosine residues that might affect trafficking we examined trafficking of wild type and VAChTΔC11 with and without the HA epitope. The VAChTΔC11 mutant reacted with the anti-C-terminal VAChT antibody. We found no difference. This observation is in agreement with the data of Tan et al. (36Tan P.K. Waites C. Liu Y. Krantz D.E. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17351-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) who also showed that the HA epitope did not affect VAChT subcellular localization in PC12 cells. Immunofluorescence was used to compare the trafficking of the deletion mutants. As shown in Fig. 5, all of the mutants exhibit a different subcellular localization from wild type VAChT, which is found in a perinuclear region colocalized with synaptophysin, the marker for synaptic-like microvesicles. PC12 cells expressing the VAChTΔC11 mutant, in which the interaction with AP-2 was eliminated and the interaction with AP-1 was diminished, showed staining mostly on the plasma membrane, but a small fraction still colocalized with synaptophysin. This expression pattern appeared very similar to what we observed with a dileucine mutant, Fig. 5. However, PC12 cells expressing the VAChTΔC37 or the VAChTΔC53 mutant exhibited staining throughout the cell. The mis-sorting of the VAChTΔC11 and VAChTΔC37 mutants was further confirmed by sucrose density gradient fractionation of transiently transfected PC12 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, transiently transfected wild type VAChT colocalized with synaptophysin the marker for synaptic-like microvesicles. In agreement with immunofluorescent staining the VAChTΔC11 mutant was partially colocalized with synaptophysin, but was reproducibly shifted one to two fractions in the direction of the more dense part of the sucrose gradient. In a similar analysis the VAChTΔC37 mutant was clearly mislocalized appearing as two distinct peaks in different parts of the sucrose gradient. Neither peak co-migrated with either secretogranin II or synaptophysin.Fig. 6Sucrose linear gradient fractionation of wild type and deletion mutant VAChT. Post-nuclear supernatants from wild type or rVAChT mutant-transfected PC12 cells were fractionated on a 0.6–1.6 M continuous sucrose gradient.

Although ceramide is pro-apoptotic and sphingosine is generally growth-inhibitory, sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling promotes cell proliferation, survival, and migration. Sphingosine kinase is thus in a strategic position to regulate important cell fate decisions which may contribute to normal animal development. To facilitate studies examining the potential role of sphingosine kinase and long chain base metabolism in Drosophila development, we characterized two putative Drosophila sphingosine kinase genes, Sk1 and Sk2. Both genes functionally and biochemically complement a yeast sphingosine kinase mutant, express predominantly cytosolic activities, and are capable of phosphorylating a range of endogenous and non-endogenous sphingoid base substrates. The two genes demonstrate overlapping but distinct temporal and spatial expression patterns in the Drosophila embryo, and timing of expression is consistent with observed changes in long chain base levels throughout development. A null Sk2 transposon insertion mutant demonstrated elevated long chain base levels, impaired flight performance, and diminished ovulation. This is the first reported mutation of a sphingosine kinase in an animal model; the associated phenotypes indicate that Sk1 and Sk2 are not redundant in biological function and that sphingosine kinase is essential for diverse physiological functions in this organism.

English D. Milstien S.

Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). S1P signals are transduced through both extracellular (receptor-mediated) and intracellular mechanisms. Intracellularly, S1P signaling affects cytoskeletal organization, calcium homeostasis, DNA synthesis, and the apoptotic machinery. S1P is generated by the phosphorylation of sphingosine, a reaction catalyzed by sphingosine kinase (SK). It is eliminated through dephosphorylation catalyzed by either S1P phosphatase (S1PP) or type 2 phosphatidate phosphohydrolases or through its irreversible degradation to a long chain aldehyde and ethanolamine phosphate, catalyzed by sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase (SPL) (Fig. 1). SK is a member of a growing class of lipid kinases, including diacylglycerol kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, that participate in cell signaling. Many studies have implicated SK activation and S1P generation in mediating angiogenesis, tumorigenicity, metastasis, cell proliferation, motility, lymphocyte trafficking, endocytosis, and survival (reviewed in Refs. 3Duronio V.

These consensus sequences appear critical to the structural integrity of the proteins and probably enable substrate recognition, as they are altered in ceramide kinases (21Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A.

The SK enzymes studied to date are capable of phosphorylating erythro-sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, and phytosphingosine in an ATP-dependent fashion and are inhibited by a growing number of compounds, including the two most well tested in biological systems, dl-threo-dihydrosphingosine (22Buehrer B.M.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12892-12898Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). SK activity is widely distributed in mouse and rat tissues and is primarily found in the cytosolic fraction (20Melendez A.J. Carlos-Dias E. Gosink M. Allen J.M. Takacs L.

However, SK activity is also found to be associated with mitochondrial and microsomal fractions, and activated forms of SK are associated with the plasma membrane to which they have been demonstrated to translocate in several cell types (26Johnson K.R.

Mammalian SK activity is encoded by at least two genes, Sphk1 (18Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Sphk1 is regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional (phosphorylation and translocation) levels, whereas regulation of Sphk2 has not been established (see Ref. 30Sukocheva O.A. Wang L. Albanese N. Pitson S.M. Vadas M.A. Xia P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 31Olivera A. Spiegel S. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2001; 64: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Sphk1 and -2 demonstrate distinct enzyme kinetics and temporal and spatial expression patterns. Additional functional distinctions between Sphk1 and Sphk2 are evident. For example, whereas Sphk1 enhances cell survival and proliferation, Sphk2 induces apoptosis through the release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase 3, potentially through a BH3 domain and Bcl-xL interactions (32Liu H. Toman R.E. Goparaju S. Maceyka M. Nava V.E. Sankala H. Payne S.G. Bektas M. Ishii I. Chun J. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40330-40336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Sphk2 also appears to be the enzyme that most efficiently phosphorylates the novel immune modulator FTY720 to the active drug (33Billich A. Bornancin F. Devay P. Mechtcheriakova D. Urtz N. Baumruker T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47408-47415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Cell fate must be precisely regulated during development. The formation of physiologically and morphologically normal tissues requires exquisitely choreographed developmental processes that involve proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Because of the diverse cellular responses elicited by S1P, it is not surprising that genes involved in S1P signaling and metabolism have proven essential for the development of complex organisms (34Kupperman E.

Development. 2003; 130: 2443-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) that both accumulation and depletion of sphingolipid intermediates can be achieved predictably in vivo through mutation of genes encoding sphingolipid metabolic enzymes in Drosophila melanogaster. Disrupting sphingolipid synthesis through mutation of serine acyltransferase (lace) depletes endogenous long chain bases (LCBs) and phosphorylated long chain bases (LCBPs) and results in embryonic lethality. Hypomorphic alleles are associated with morphological abnormalities of the eye, wing, antennae, and bristles (39Adachi-Yamada T. Gotoh T. Sugimura I. Tateno M. Nishida Y. Onuki T. Date H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7276-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). LCB and LCBP accumulation caused by disrupting SPL (Sply) and the degradative pathway results in a different complement of phenotypes including cell-specific increases in embryonic and post-embryonic apoptosis, defects in adult muscle patterning, and reduced fecundity and viability. The array of phenotypes associated with each of these single mutations, although distinct, can be ameliorated by introduction of a second mutation disrupting the other gene, resulting in the normalization of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated long chain base levels. However, because these initial studies involved mutations that altered the content of more than one sphingolipid species, additional genetic models are required to determine the precise roles of individual sphingolipid metabolites in mediating these effects. In this regard, a recent study has shown that the overexpression of ceramidase, which would be predicted to reduce intracellular concentrations of ceramide, rescues the degeneration of photoreceptor cells in Drosophila arrestin mutants (40Acharya U. Patel S. Koundakjian E. Nagashima K. Han X. Acharya J.K. Science. 2003; 299: 1740-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the work presented here, we have identified two genes that encode distinct SK isoforms in Drosophila and have characterized a null mutation of one of these genes, Sk2, that results in impaired flight performance and diminished fecundity. Cloning of Sk1 and Sk2—The D. melanogaster genomic database (www.fruitfly.org/) was searched for nucleotide sequences encoding SK genes using the mouse Sphk1a sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF068748). DNA homology searches were performed via the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project web site using the BLAST search program. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were identified that correspond to two Drosophila genes, Sk1 (CG1747) and Sk2 (CG32484/CG2159). This nomenclature was established previously (41Dobrosotskaya I.Y. Seegmiller A.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Rawson R.B. Science. 2002; 296: 879-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and does not imply a homologous relationship between Drosophila Sk1 and human Sphk1. The Sk1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR from EST RE64552 using the primer pair CG1747-5′ (5′-ATGACGGCCAACACAGGGAC-3′) and CG1747-3′ (5′-CTACTGCCCACTGGTGGTCA-3′) and introduced into the cloning vector pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). The Sk1 open reading frame was subsequently recloned into yeast shuttle vector, pYES2 (Invitrogen), at HindIII and NotI restriction sites. The Sk2 open reading frame was amplified by PCR from EST LD11247 using the primer pair CG2159-5′ (5′-TCCAAAGCTTATGAGCGAATCTCTTGATA-3′) and CG2159-3′ (5′-TGCTGGATTCTCTTCAGTAAGCTCCTCCT-3′) and cloned directly into pYES2 at HindIII and BamHI sites. The resulting galactose-inducible constructs were introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain JSK392 (Δlcb4 Δysr2 Δdpl1) (42Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the lithium acetate method (1Spiegel S. English D. Milstien S. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 236-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Functional Expression and Complementation of S. cerevisiae Mutants—Yeast strain JSK392 contains null alleles of endogenous SPL (DPL1), major S1PP (YSR2), and major SK (LCB4) genes (42Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strain is viable and healthy in the absence of SK activity. However, when a functional SK is expressed in this background, the cells cannot grow due to massive accumulation of LCBPs. To evaluate the ability of Sk1 and Sk2 to functionally complement a yeast SK mutant, strains JSK392[Sk1-pYES2] and JSK392[Sk2-pYES2] were inoculated onto uracil- agar plates containing 2% galactose and control uracil- agar plates containing 2% glucose. Complementation was demonstrated by lack of growth in the presence of galactose. LCBP Measurements in Yeast Overexpressing Sk1 and Sk2—Endogenous yeast LCBPs were evaluated in yeast strains JSK398 (pGAL-vector [LEU2] in JSK392), JSK392(Sk1-pYES2). and JSK392(Sk2-pYES2) (42Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under induction and repression conditions. Colonies were picked from plates and grown overnight at 30 °C with shaking in synthetic complete medium lacking either leucine (SC-LEU) or uracil (SC-URA) in the presence of 2% glucose. One aliquot was resuspended at A600 = 0.2 in rich medium containing 2% glucose (YPGlu) and incubated at 30 °C with shaking (repression conditions). A second aliquot was washed three times in sterile water followed by a wash in rich media containing 2% galactose (YPGal), resuspended at A600 = 0.2 in YPGal, and incubated at 30 °C with shaking (induction conditions). Cells were harvested at 12 h, and lipids were extracted essentially as described (42Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dried lipid extracts were resuspended in 2 ml of chloroform/methanol, 1:1 (v/v), and 0.5 ml of 1.5 m ammonium hydroxide in water was added while vortexing. A clear separation of the two phases was obtained following centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min. The aqueous phase was recovered, dried down, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of methanol/water, 1:1 (v/v), containing 0.1% acetic acid. Additional purification of the LCBPs in the aqueous phase was performed on a Strata C18-E column, as described previously (37Herr D.R. Fyrst H. Phan V. Heinecke K. Georges R. Harris G.L. Saba J.D. Development. 2003; 130: 2443-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the purified LCBPs were labeled with ortho-phthalaldehyde and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described previously (42Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SK Activity in Yeast Overexpressing Sk1 and Sk2—Yeast were grown essentially as described above except that overnight aliquots were resuspended at A600 = 1.0 in either YPGlu or YPGal and incubated at 30 °C with shaking for 5 h. Cell extracts were prepared by vortexing with glass beads as described previously, and protein concentration was determined by using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) (11Lanterman M.M. Saba J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The substrate for the SK activity assay was prepared by drying down a mixture of LCBs and C16-lysophosphatidylcholine, 1:9 (mol/mol). Substrate was resuspended in 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol by tip sonication for 20 s. Aliquots of 25 μl of substrate mixture containing 10 nmol of LCBs were added into each sample tube followed by the addition of 50 μl of 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 15 mm magnesium chloride, and cell extract with the equivalent of 50 μg of protein. Samples were pre-incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, and the SK reaction was started by adding 25 μl of 10 mm ATP. Samples were incubated for 30 min, at which time 1 nmol of an internal LCBP standard was added to each sample. The SK reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 1.5 m ammonium hydroxide in water and 2 ml of chloroform/methanol, 2:1 (v/v). The aqueous phase was recovered and dried down, and the LCBPs were labeled with ortho-phthalaldehyde and quantified by HPLC as described (42Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assay—Embryos aged 12–24 h were homogenized in lysate buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to separate membrane and cytosolic fractions. The membrane fraction (pellet) was resuspended in lysis buffer by sonication. SK activity was determined by the formation of 32P-labeled C18-S1P essentially as described (11Lanterman M.M. Saba J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Relative signal intensity was determined using ImageQuant software. In Situ Hybridization—Hybridizations were performed using standard conditions (43Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole embryos of all stages were fixed, hybridized to a digoxygenin-labeled riboprobe (Roche Applied Science catalog number 1 175 025) overnight at 45 °C, washed vigorously over 24 h, bound to an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Roche Applied Science catalog number 1 201 085), and developed in a nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate solution (Roche Applied Science catalog number 1 175 041). When indicated, embryos were also incubated in rabbit α-VASA (1:10,000) (44Lasko P.F. Ashburner M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) for 4 h and then in fluorescein-conjugated goat α-rabbit IgG (1:100) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, catalog number 111-095-003). Northern Analysis—10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a denaturing 1% agarose gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and UV cross-linked. 32P-Labeled cDNA probes were heat-denatured and hybridized to the membrane for 2 h in ExpressHyb solution (Clontech catalog number 8015-2). Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated from Drosophila at each indicated stage using an RNeasy Protect Mini Kit (Qiagen catalog number 74124). 5 μg of each sample were DNase-treated and primed with oligo(dT) prior to cDNA synthesis with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Targets were amplified with iQ sybr green supermix (Bio-Rad catalog number 170-8880) on a Bio-Rad iCycler with the following primer pairs: RpL32-RT-L (5′-ATGCTAAGCTGTCGCACAAA-3′) and RpL32-RT-R (5′-GTTCGATCCGTAACCGATGT-3′); Sk1-RT-L (5′-TCACCACACATCCGCAGTAT-3′) and Sk1-RT-R (5′-AATCCATGCGTTCCATTAGC-3′); and Sk2-RT-L (5′-GACGGCACCATCTACCTGAT-3′) and Sk2-RT-R (5′-ATGATGCCGTGATTGTCGTA-3′). Relative gene expression was determined using the 2-ΔΔCT method (45Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar). Drosophila Husbandry and Genetics—Flies were reared on standard yeast/sucrose media at 22 °C. Sk2KG05894 was a gift of the P-element Screen/Gene Disruption Project of the Bellen/Rubin/Spradling laboratories. Wild-type Canton-S (BL-1) was obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (Indiana University, Bloomington, IN). Sk253A was generated by introducing a stable source of transposase to Sk2KG05894 for a single generation and screening progeny for loss of the dominant marker (y+) carried on the P-element (SUPor-P). Precise excision was verified by PCR amplification and sequencing of the insertion site. Flight Analysis—2–7-Day-old flies were released in a top-lit, Plexiglas chamber and scored for flight performance as follows: upward flight = 3, horizontal flight = 2, downward flight = 1, no flight = 0. Mean flight performance was determined ± S.E. (n = 168–365). Quantitation of Endogenous Drosophila C14 and C16 Long Chain Bases (LCBs) in Sk2 Mutant and Canton-S Flies throughout Development—Endogenous Drosophila LCBs were extracted and analyzed as described (46Fyrst H. Herr D.R. Harris G.L. Saba J.D. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 45: 54-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Identification of Two Putative D. melanogaster Sphingosine Kinases—The peptide sequence of human Sphk1 (GenBank™ accession number NP_068807) was used in TBLASTN searches against all known Drosophila sequences. Two loci with substantial sequence similarity were identified (Fig. 2A). Both were annotated as predicted genes (47Misra S. Crosby M.A. Mungall C.J. Matthews B.B. Campbell K.S. Hradecky P. Huang Y. Kaminker J.S. Millburn G.H. Prochnik S.E. Smith C.D. Tupy J.L. Whitfied E.J. Bayraktaroglu L. Berman B.P. Bettencourt B.R. Celniker S.E. de Grey A.D. Drysdale R.A. Harris N.L. Richter J. Russo S.

The first, Sk1 (formerly CG1747, GenBank™ accession number AAF48045), is located on the X chromosome at region 10B13 (Fig. 2B). There are two predicted splice variants (2614 and 2472 bp, respectively) that result in alternative 5′-untranslated sequences. The predicted protein for both transcripts contains 641 amino acids and has a mass of 71 kDa. There are no reported mutant alleles of this gene. The second locus, Sk2 (formerly CG32484, GenBank™ accession number AAF47706), is located on the third chromosome at region 63A3-5 (Fig. 2C) and contains a single intron. The predicted protein product contains 661 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 74 kDa. This gene has one recorded mutant allele, Sk2KG05894, which harbors a P-element insertion in the 5′-untranslated region (49Roseman R.R. Johnson E.A. Rodesch C.K. Bjerke M. Nagoshi R.N. Geyer P.K. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1061-1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SK1 and SK2 proteins are 39% identical and 63% similar to one another. Both proteins contain five domains conserved within the diacylglycerol kinase putative catalytic domain family. Both SK1 and SK2 are more similar to mammalian Sphk2 than to Sphk1, with Drosophila SK1 demonstrating 33% identity and 47% similarity to murine Sphk2 versus 27% identity and 42% similarity to murine Sphk1, and Drosophila SK2 demonstrating 32% identity and 45% similarity to murine Sphk2 versus 27% identity and 39% similarity to murine Sphk1. Similarities among SK1, SK2, and the mammalian Sphk2 proteins are distributed throughout the length of the proteins and include a domain near the N terminus of ∼100 amino acids shared by these three proteins but which is not present in murine or human Sphk1. A conserved SGDGX17–21K sphingosine kinase motif has been proposed in which the second conserved glycine is critical for ATP binding, and the conserved downstream lysine facilitates nucleotide orientation within the binding pocket (21Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Zareie R. Derian C.K. Darrow A.L. Qi J. D'Andrea R.J. Bagley C.J. Vadas M.A. Wattenberg B.W. J. Biol.

This motif is present in murine and human Sphk1 proteins and human Sphk2, whereas in murine Sphk2 the lysine has been replaced by an arginine. Similarly, in Drosophila SK1, the SGDG is conserved, and an arginine replaces the lysine. However, in SK2 the motif is altered to GGDG, and an arginine is present in the 12th position, reminiscent of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate kinases. Murine Sphk2 was also reported recently (32Liu H. Toman R.E. Goparaju S. Maceyka M. Nava V.E. Sankala H. Payne S.G. Bektas M. Ishii I. Chun J. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

Developmental regulation of the Drosophila enzyme is suggested to be involved in thymine-less apoptosis. Here we show that in addition to conserved dUTPase sequence motifs, the gene of Drosophila enzyme codes for a unique Ala-Pro-rich segment. Kinetic and structural analyses of the recombinant protein and a truncation mutant show that the Ala-Pro segment is flexible and has no regulatory role in vitro. The homotrimer enzyme unfolds reversibly as a trimeric entity with a melting temperature of 54 °C, 23 °C lower than Escherichia coli dUTPase. In contrast to the bacterial enzyme, Mg2+ binding modulates conformation of fly dUTPase, as identified by spectroscopy and by increment in melting temperature. A single well folded, but inactive, homotrimeric core domain is generated through three distinct steps of limited trypsinolysis. In fly, but not in bacterial dUTPase, binding of the product dUMP induces protection against proteolysis at the tryptic site reflecting formation of the catalytically competent closed conformer. Crystallographic analysis argues for the presence of a stable monomer of Drosophila dUTPase in crystal phase. The significant differences between prototypes of eukaryotic and prokaryotic dUTPases with respect to conformational flexibility of the active site, substrate specificity, metal ion binding, and oligomerization in the crystal phase are consistent with alteration of the catalytic mechanism and hydropathy of subunit interfaces. dUTPase is responsible for preventive DNA repair via exclusion of uracil.

The significant differences between prototypes of eukaryotic and prokaryotic dUTPases with respect to conformational flexibility of the active site, substrate specificity, metal ion binding, and oligomerization in the crystal phase are consistent with alteration of the catalytic mechanism and hydropathy of subunit interfaces. DNA repair processes and an exquisite fine-tuning of nucleotide metabolism is required for genome stability and maintenance. The enzyme dUTPase catalyzes the hydrolysis of dUTP into dUMP and anorganic pyrophosphate using a metal ion (Mg2+) (1Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3305-3312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Larsson G. Nyman P.O. Kvassman J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24010-24016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Through this reaction, the enzyme keeps the cellular dUTP/dTTP ratio at a low level by depleting the dUTP pool and contributing in parallel to dTTP biosynthesis (3Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication.2nd Ed. Freeman, New York1991Google Scholar). Lack of the enzyme leads to massive uracil incorporation into DNA, repair of which via base excision, an efficient pathway to remove uracil, progresses to a hyperactive futile cycle resulting in DNA double-strand breaks, chromosome fragmentation, and cell death (4Tye B.K.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3225-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). dUTPase is therefore reported to be a preventive DNA repair factor (6Pearl L.H. Savva R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 485-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), essential in both prokaryotes (7el-Hajj H.H. Zhang H. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and eukaryotes (8Gadsden M.H. McIntosh E.M. Game J.C. Wilson P.J. Haynes R.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4425-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and a key determinant of viral host cell range and infectivity of Herpes simplex virus (9Pyles R.B. Sawtell N.M. Thompson R.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6706-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as several retroviruses (10Threadgill D.S. Steagall W.K. Flaherty M.T. Fuller F.J. Perry S.T. Rushlow K.E. Le Grice S.F.

N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 1136-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Their molecular mechanism of action is to induce grave perturbances in the cellular dUTP/dTTP pools that result in thymine-less cell death preferentially killing cells with actively ongoing DNA synthesis, e.g. tumor and virus-infected cells (14Aherne G.W. Browne S. Jackman A.L. Anticancer Development Guide: Antifolate Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 409-421Google Scholar). dUTPase inhibition would obviously result in similar effects. The importance of thymine-less cell death is underlined by the fact that this apoptotic pathway is independent from p53 signaling, at least in hematopoietic cells (15Munoz-Pinedo C. Oliver F.J. Lopez-Rivas A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Quite recently, activation of dUTPase gene expression in p53 mutant tumor cells argued for a particular significance of dUTPase in tumor development and survival (16Pugacheva E.N. Ivanov A.V. Kravchenko J.E. Kopnin B.P. Levine A.J. Chumakov P.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4595-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, cellular studies in human cancer cell lines, which show development of resistance against fluorouracil via dUTPase overexpression (17Canman C.E. Radany E.H. Parsels L.A. Davis M.A. Lawrence T.S. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2296-2298PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ladner R.D. Lynch F.J. Groshen S. Xiong Y.P. Sherrod A. Caradonna S.J. Stoehlmacher J. Lenz H.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3493-3503PubMed Google Scholar), indicate that benefits and success of the anticancer therapy based on inducing thymine-less cell death may ultimately depend on a critical interplay among enzymes of thymidylate metabolism. In addition to its importance as a novel chemotherapeutic strategy, dUTPase inhibition is also suggested to play a significant role in developmental apoptosis, at least in Drosophila melanogaster (19Nation M.D. Guzder S.N. Giroir L.E. Deutsch W.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is therefore of immediate interest to investigate these enzymes. A wealth of data and in-depth analyses are available on thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase, but our knowledge on dUTPases is lagging behind. For human dUTPase, a series of thorough studies (18Ladner R.D. Lynch F.J. Groshen S. Xiong Y.P. Sherrod A. Caradonna S.J. Stoehlmacher J. Lenz H.J.

Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainer J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, no enzymological characterization is yet available for any eukaryotic dUTPase.Eukaryotic, bacterial, and retroviral (EuBaR) 1The abbreviations used are: EuBaR, eukaryotic, bacterial, and retroviral; DSC, differential scanning microcalorimetry; FIV, feline immunodeficiency virus; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-amino}ethanesulfonic acid; MS, mass spectrometry. 1The abbreviations used are: EuBaR, eukaryotic, bacterial, and retroviral; DSC, differential scanning microcalorimetry; FIV, feline immunodeficiency virus; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-amino}ethanesulfonic acid; MS, mass spectrometry. dUTPases are usually homotrimers where each β-pleated subunit forms its own jelly roll topology by swapping the C-terminal β-strand of the neighboring subunit, as shown in the crystal structures (24Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainer J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 25Prasad G.S. Stura E.A. McRee D.E. Laco G.S.

Biol. 1999; 285: 655-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Despite limited sequence homology, the dUTPase trimeric fold seems to be well conserved from bacteria to man and even in retroviruses. Active site architecture also follows a common pattern where the three active sites of the homotrimer, located in clefts between neighboring subunits, are built in a fashion of basically 3-fold symmetry recruiting conserved motifs from all subunits (24Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainer J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 27Dauter Z. Persson R. Rosengren A.M. Nyman P.O. Wilson K.S.

Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1100-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Two successive β-strands and their connecting turn constitute the core of the active site that accommodates the uracil and deoxyribose rings of the substrate dUTP. Phosphate recognition is provided conserved motifs of the neighboring subunit. The third subunit contributes its C-terminal fifth conserved motif, the ordering of which upon the active site induces the catalytically competent closed conformation (24Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainer J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 29Prasad G.S. Stura E.A. Elder J.H. Stout C.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Despite the overall similarities, the available data suggest the existence of marked differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic dUTPases. First, structural superpositions and sequence alignments have indicated that the 3-fold inner channel of the trimer is highly apolar in prokaryotic dUTPases, whereas it is constructed by strongly conserved polar or charged residues in the eukaryotic enzymes (24Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainer J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 31Fiser A. Vertessy B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Gonzalez A. Larsson G. Persson R. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Second, in agreement with the altered hydropathy of the inner 3-fold interaction surfaces, a divalent metal ion (Mg2+) has been localized at the base of this inner channel in the crystal structure of the human enzyme (24Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainer J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), 18 Å away from the active site. There is no place for such a metal ion in the structure of the prokaryote Escherichia coli dUTPase where the 3-fold channel is densely packed with hydrophobic side chains. Third, based on crystal structure data of human and E. coli dUTPases, the crucial conformational change leading to the formation of the catalytically competent closed enzyme conformer may occur with an altered timing in these two enzymes. This conformational change is realized by intricate subunit interactions as the C terminus of one subunit crosses over its neighboring subunit and adopts an ordered conformation to contact the substrate bound in the active site of the third subunit. In the bacterial enzyme, detailed functional investigations (2Larsson G. Nyman P.O. Kvassman J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24010-24016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30Vertessy B.G. Larsson G. Persson T. Bergman A.C. Persson R. Nyman P.O. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33Vertessy B.G. Proteins. 1997; 28: 568-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 34Nord J. Nyman P. Larsson G. Drakenberg T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), in agreement with the crystal structure in complex with the nucleotide dUDP (28Larsson G. Svensson L.A. Nyman P.O. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), indicate that the γ phosphate of the substrate is indispensable in inducing the closed conformer, and after catalytic cleavage the active site pops open. In the case of the human enzyme, the crystal structure suggests the retaining of the closed conformer even with the product dUMP (24Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainer J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), but there are no functional data published. This difference in active site conformational rearrangements, dependent on subunit interactions, suggests that the catalytic cycle may be altered in the bacterial and human dUTPases. The pattern of subunit interactions is conserved with a different hydropathy in prokaryotic and eukaryotic dUTPases (31Fiser A. Vertessy B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, the putative alteration in the catalytic cycle may be a general difference between bacteria and eukaryotes. A critical assessment of this hypothesis needs functional experiments in the solution phase because crystallization conditions are prone to induce ordering of loops, which are flexible in solution, via crystal packing interactions.An earlier study reported the presence of dUTPase in D. melanogaster, stating that the enzyme is a monomer with a molecular mass of 45 kDa (35Giroir L.E. Deutsch W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 130-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, all EuBaR dUTPases characterized to date are homotrimers with a subunit molecular mass of 15-18 kDa. We recently identified a sequence in D. melanogaster expressed sequence tag data bases encoding a putative dUTPase containing all the five conserved motifs (31Fiser A. Vertessy B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To resolve the contradiction and provide a eukaryotic dUTPase for functional investigations, in the present study we report cloning of D. melanogaster dUTPase together with enzymological, structural, and initial crystallographic characterization of the recombinant protein. Details of structural and functional differences of E. coli and D. melanogaster dUTPases indicate alterations in active site flexibility, Mg2+ ion binding, substrate specificity, and oligomerization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESElectrophoresis materials and Chelex resin were obtained from BioRad, and other chromatography resins and columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Phenol Red indicator and ammonium bicarbonate were obtained from Merck. Nucleotides, buffer substances, and other materials of analytical grade purity were from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and other molecular biology materials were purchased from Stratagene, unless stated otherwise. E. coli dUTPase was purified as described previously (36Persson R. Nord J. Roth R. Nyman P.O. Prep. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2002; 32: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).Plasmids, Vectors, and Bacterial Strains—The plasmid clone LD 20050 (Research Genetics, Inc.) harboring the D. melanogaster dUTPase gene (31Fiser A. Vertessy B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) constituted the starting material for cloning. The plasmid pET22b (Novagen) in the E. coli strains BL21(DE3), ER2566, JM109(DE3), and AD494(DE3) was used for protein expression. E. coli XL1-Blue (Promega) was used for plasmid amplification.Cloning and Expression Vector Construction—The plasmid LD 20050 was used as a template for amplification of the D. melanogaster dUTPase gene by PCR. The PCR was performed with the 5′ primer 5′-ACGGAATTcaTatgccaAGCaccgatttcgccgacattc and two different 3′ primers 5′-ctgcCTCGAGTTActtgactccggtggaaccgaatc and 5′-GAGCTCGAGATCtacgtagcaacaggagccggag (uppercase denotes nonpairing bases), for generating two different D. melanogaster dUTPase constructs containing residues 1-159 or residues 1-187, respectively (cf. cDNA and translated protein sequence in Ref. 31Fiser A. Vertessy B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Together, these primers introduce an EcoRI (GAATTC) site just upstream of the gene, an NdeI (CATATG) site fused into the start ATG codon, together with either a single XhoI site (CTCGAG) downstream of the gene (short construct, for producing dUTPase (1-159)), or a combination of an XhoI site and a BglII site (AGATCT) (this latter fused into the stop TAG codon, long construct, for producing dUTPase (1-187)). The BglII site was introduced to facilitate distinction between the short and long DNA constructs whose lengths differ only by ∼80 base pairs. Additionally, the TCASer codon of the original cDNA was changed into AGCSer, more frequently used in E. coli. The PCR product, created by using Pfu polymerase, was purified and concentrated using the QIAquick PCR purification kit and then digested with EcoRI and XhoI. The fragments were run on agarose gels, and the gene of the correct length was excised, purified using a Sephaglass DNA purification kit and ligated overnight into the pET22b vector (previously digested with EcoRI and XhoI and purified with the Sephaglass DNA purification kit) using NEB ligase (New England BioLabs). These pET22 constructs, containing either the shorter or the longer construct of the D. melanogaster dUTPase gene, were digested with NdeI/PstI, and the resulting fragments were ligated into pET22b predigested with NdeI/PstI. The resulting recombinant pET22b plasmids, containing the D. melanogaster dUTPase gene, were named SDdut-pET22b and LDdut-pET22b, for the 1-159 (short) and the 1-187 (long) Drosophila dUTPase gene products. SDdut-pET22b and LDdut-pET22b were electroporated into the XL1-Blue E. coli strain. Plating XL1-Blue transformed with SDdut-pET22b resulted in a low number of recombinant colonies, reflecting some degree of intolerance between the eukaryotic gene containing vector and the XL1-Blue strain. Nevertheless, these recombinant colonies could be used further for plasmid production, albeit with low efficiency. The intolerance between plasmid LDdut-pET22b and XL1-Blue was even more evident, excluding the appearance of transformed colonies in this case. The problem was circumvented by pasting together the first half of the short construct (already proven to co-exist in pET22b with E. coli XL1-Blue and BL21(DE3)) and the second half of the long construct utilizing a BamHI site originally present in the middle of the D. melanogaster dUTPase. This chimera, containing the coding region for the D. melanogaster dUTPase (1-187) in intact form, proved to result in a small number of viable transformants colonies and adopted the previously used denomination LDdut-pET22b.Plasmids LDdut-pET22b and SDdut-pET22b also showed some intolerance in various other E. coli strains (ER2566, JM109(DE3), and AD494(DE3)), resulting in a low efficiency of transformation. Nevertheless, expression was at high level in the transformants. It is worthwhile to note that in our parallel experiments, the D. melanogaster gene cloned into the high copy number pKS plasmid gave a high frequency of recombinants in all the above listed E. coli strains. The fact that it was a version of plasmid pKS, containing the T7 promoter region, that could be successfully used for the cloning of the human dUTPase gene (24Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainer J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) may suggest the presence of some common characteristics between these eukaryotic dUTPase genes causing adversary interference with pET vectors in E. coli.The inserted gene and flanking regions of plasmids SDdut-pET22b and LDdut-pET22b were sequenced on both strands using ABI PRISM 2.1.0. (Applied Biosystems). Oligonucleotide primer synthesis and automated DNA sequencing were performed using the Biological Research Center facilities in Szeged, Hungary.Expression and Purification of Recombinant D. melanogaster dUTPase—The recombinant plasmid SDdut-pET22b or LDdut-pET22b was transformed via electroporation into E. coli BL21(DE3) or E. coli ER2566 strains, both containing the gene for T7 RNA polymerase (37Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar). Transformants were grown on ampicillin-containing standard LB-agar plates overnight at 37 °C and were used to inoculate 500 ml of LB medium, supplemented with carbenicillin in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks. The cells were propagated at 500 rpm on aerated shaker platforms until the culture reached the exponential growth phase as followed by measuring optical density at 600 nm. At this phase (usually at 0.3-0.4 readings), the synthesis of T7 RNA polymerase was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the cells were grown for an additional 5-6 h. The cells were harvested through centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min and stored at -70 °C. The cell pellets were solubilized in 1/10 volume of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) on ice. Following the addition of 50 μg/ml lysozyme, 1 μg/ml RNase, and 1 μg/ml DNase, cell suspensions were stirred on ice for 30 min, sonicated (3-5 × 60 s), stirred again for 20 min on ice, and centrifuged (18,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). Final supernatants were loaded on a Q-Sepharose ion exchange column (200 ml) equilibrated in 25 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.5 buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and developed using a total volume of 700-ml linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in the equilibration buffer, as created by the Gradifrac system (Amersham Biosciences). D. melanogaster dUTPase appeared in fractions at 0.5-0.6 m NaCl, as followed by enzyme activity measurements and SDS-PAGE. Depending on enzyme purity, gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) was also employed, if necessary. The purified preparations appeared as single bands on SDS-PAGE gels when investigated by densitometry, suggesting at least 95% purity. Enzyme stocks were concentrated on Millipore centrifugal filters (10-kDa cut-off) to 8-15 mg/ml final concentration, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. As shown by activity measurements and SDS-PAGE, this storage did not cause considerable degradation up to 3 months. More prolonged storage and several cycles of freeze/thaw did cause slight fragmentation, as observed on SDS-PAGE (cf. Fig. 5A, lane 11), without any effect on the catalytic activity. Throughout the present study, molar enzyme concentrations refer to the monomeric species, unless stated otherwise. Before use, aliquots of the enzyme were dialyzed against respective buffers.Protein Concentration—Protein concentration was measured either by Bradford's assay ((38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar), using the protein determination kit from Sigma, and bovine serum albumin as standard) or spectrophotometrically using A1cm,280nm0.1%=0.32,0.26,or0.52, for the D. melanogaster dUTPase constructs 1-159, 1-187, or E. coli dUTPase, respectively, as calculated from amino acid composition or determined experimentally (39Vertessy B.G.

Commun. 1996; 219: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Discontinuous Qualitative dUTPase Enzyme Activity Assay by Thin Layer Chromatography—For fast and convenient check of enzyme activity in crude extracts, where buffer composition presented experimental difficulties for the continuous spectrophotometric pH indicator assay, thin layer chromatography offered an alternative. The reactions were run at ∼50-100 nm dUTPase concentration, in different buffers containing 10 mm dUTP and 10 mm MgCl2. The plates were developed and analyzed as in Ref. 40Barabás O. Rumlova M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38803-38812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar.Discontinuous Quantitative dUTPase Enzyme Activity Assay by Ion Exchange Column Chromatography—A similar discontinuous approach separated the substrate and product of the dUTPase catalyzed reaction and offered quantitative analysis for checking the dUTPase catalyzed reaction with different substrate analogues. 100-μl samples of reaction mixtures containing 50-100 nm dUTPase, 10 mm dUTP, or other substrate analogue, and 10 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm TES pH 7.5 buffer were taken at different time points and loaded on a MonoQ 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences fast protein liquid chromatography system). The Chromatograms were developed in 60-600 mm ammonium bicarbonate gradients at a 0.7 ml/min flow rate. Typical retention values, as percentages of gradient, were as follows: 10-15%, 42-47%, and 56-62% for dNMP, dNDP, and dNTP, respectively.Spectrophotometric Continuous dUTPase Enzyme Activity Assay—Enzyme activity was routinely assayed at enzyme concentrations 25-50 nm in 1 mm TES-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 40 μm dUTP, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, and 40 μm Phenol Red indicator (assay buffer). Proton release during the transformation of dUTP into dUMP and PPi was followed at 559 nm at 25 °C (41Vertessy B.G. Zalud P. Nyman P.O. Zeppezauer M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), using a JASCO-V550 spectrophotometer and a 10-mm pathlength at 25 °C in thermostatted cuvettes. Initial velocity was determined from the slope of the initial part (first 10 s) of the progress curve. This method was used to conveniently follow activity during purification and trypsinolysis, as well as to record substrate saturation curves with the dUTP analogues dCTP and dTTP. The enzyme kinetic parameters kcat and KM were determined either from substrate saturation curves or from the entire progress curve of dUTP cleavage using the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation, as described previously (2Larsson G. Nyman P.O. Kvassman J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24010-24016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Vertessy B.G.

https://openalex.org/W2083591609,"The function of link protein in stabilizing the interaction between aggrecan and hyaluronan to form aggrecan aggregates, via the binding of link protein to the aggrecan G1 domain and hyaluronan, is well established. However, it is not known whether link protein can function with similar avidity with versican, another member of the large hyaluronan-binding proteoglycan family that also binds to hyaluronan via its G1 domain. To address this issue, we have compared the interaction of the versican and aggrecan G1 domains with link protein and hyaluronan using recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells and BIAcore analysis. The results showed that link protein could significantly improve the binding of both G1 domains to hyaluronan and that its interaction with VG1 is of a higher affinity than that with AG1. These observations suggest that link protein may function as a stabilizer of the interaction, not only between aggrecan and hyaluronan in cartilage, but also between versican and hyaluronan in many tissues.

The family of large aggregating proteoglycans (hyalectans) includes aggrecan, versican, neurocan, and brevican (1Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Although aggrecan is most abundant in cartilage, neurocan and brevican are largely restricted to nervous tissue, and versican has a rather wide tissue distribution. Versican has been identified in loose connective tissues, in fibrous, articular, and elastic cartilages, in the central and peripheral nervous system, in the epidermis, and in all three wall layers of veins and elastic arteries (2Bode-Lesniewska B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Odermatt B.F. Briner J. Heitz P.U. Zimmermann D.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These large aggregating proteoglycans have common structural features. Their core proteins are composed of terminal globular (G) 1The abbreviations used are: G, globular; AG1, aggrecan G1 globular domain; EDAC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HA, hyaluronan; LP, link protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RU, response unit; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; VG1, versican G1 globular domain. 1The abbreviations used are: G, globular; AG1, aggrecan G1 globular domain; EDAC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HA, hyaluronan; LP, link protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RU, response unit; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; VG1, versican G1 globular domain. domains and a central chondroitin sulfate attachment domain. The N-terminal G1 domain contains an Ig-like motif, which mediates protein-protein interaction, and two link protein-type modules that are responsible for binding to hyaluronan (HA). The C-terminal G3 domain consists of one or two EGF repeats, a C-type lectin-like motif, and a complement regulatory protein-like repeat (3Yamaguchi Y. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Link protein (LP) is a major structural component of cartilage and, like versican, is also present in many other tissues (4Neame P.J. Barry F.P. Experimentia (Basel). 1993; 49: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Its amino acid sequence exhibits considerable homology with the G1 domains of the large aggregating proteoglycans, including conservation of five disulfide bonds. LP binds to the G1 domain of aggrecan and to HA, and its major function is thought to be the stabilization of the interaction between aggrecan and HA in the aggrecan·HA·LP ternary complex in cartilage (5Hardingham T.E. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, the function of LP in non-cartilaginous tissues devoid of aggrecan is less clear. The high degree of homology shared by the G1 domains of the different aggregating proteoglycans suggests that LP may also bind to their G1 domains and to HA to produce stable proteoglycan aggregates. In this study, we compare the interaction affinities of versican G1 (VG1), aggrecan G1 (AG1) and LP with each other and with HA using recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells via a baculovirus expression system. Our results demonstrate that LP has a higher affinity for VG1 than for AG1. We also demonstrate that LP stabilizes versican aggregates in addition to stabilizing aggrecan aggregates, its traditionally accepted role.

Similarly, a DNA fragment encoding human LP plus its signal peptide (10Dudhia J. Hardingham T.E.

Human primary culture keratinocytes were purchased from Colnetics Co. (San Diego). Human chondrocytes were isolated from human articular cartilage obtained at autopsy. Total RNA was extracted using TriZol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) and used as a template for PCR. The amplified PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1 vector using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and their authenticity was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To express recombinant VG1, AG1, and LP in insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen), the DNA fragments were subcloned into the pFastBac1 donor vector between the BamHI and EcoRI sites to obtain the recombinant donor plasmids pFastBac-VG1, pFastBac-AG1, and pFastBac-LP.

Gene (Amst.). 1991; 98: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), mature LP, and a C-terminal His tag, was accomplished in two steps. First, a DNA fragment encoding for mature LP and a C-terminal His tag was PCR amplified from pFastBac-LP using primers LPFa and LPR and cloned into a TA vector. This fragment was then subcloned into pMelBac (B) (Invitrogen) between the BamHI and EcoRI sites to obtain pMelBac (B)-LP. Second, the DNA fragment encoding honeybee melittin signal peptide, mature LP, and a C-terminal His tag was PCR amplified from pMelBac (B)-LP using primers HMSPF and LPR.

Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 2903-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System, and the recombinant baculoviruses were used to infect High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Recombinant proteins were purified from the culture supernatant by Sephadex G-25 and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON) column chromatography (8Shi S. Ciurli C. Cartman A. Pidoux I. Poole A.R. Zhang Y. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 2903-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the recombinant proteins were determined by the method of Bradford (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214409) Google Scholar). Characterization of Purified Recombinant Proteins—To assess purity, recombinant proteins were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and silver staining and by Western blotting using specific monoclonal antibodies. The anti-His tag antibody was purchased from Qiagen. Antibody 12C5, specific for versican, 1C6 for aggrecan, and 8A4 for LP were provided by the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Department of Biological Sciences, the University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Antibody 12C5 recognizes an epitope located on the G1 domain of versican, and 1C6 recognizes a conserved sequence present once on each of the aggrecan G1 and G2 domains (13Fosang A.J. Hardingham T.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To confirm further the authenticity of the recombinant proteins they were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Biotinylation of HA and Recombinant Proteins—Biotinylated HA was prepared by a modification of the method described by Melrose et al. (14Melrose J. Little C.B. Ghosh P. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), in which a reduced amount of biotinylation reagent was employed. In brief, 100 mg of HA (Sigma) was dissolved overnight at 4 °C in 20 ml of water. 0.8 g of adipic acid dihydrazide (Sigma) was added and the pH adjusted to 4.75 with 0.1 n HCl. 0.1 g of EDAC HCl (Sigma) was then added and the pH maintained at 4.75 by the addition of small aliquots of 0.1 n HCl. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, the solution was adjusted to pH 7.0 with 0.1 n NaOH, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized to obtain hydrazido-HA. 100 mg of hydrazido-HA was redissolved overnight in 20 ml of 0.2 m NaHCO3 at 4 °C. 10 mg of biotin-3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide (Sigma) was added to the solution and incubation continued for 18 h at room temperature. Finally, 0.25 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, was added, and the product was dialyzed against PBS. In the original method of Melrose et al. (14Melrose J. Little C.B. Ghosh P. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), an approximately equimolar amount of biotinylation reagent, relative to HA disaccharide content, resulted in about 35% substitution of HA carboxyl groups. In the present study the biotinylation reagent was reduced to one-tenth of that described by Melrose et al. so that the expected glucuronic acid substitution would be correspondingly reduced to about 3.5% but certainly not to exceed 10%. Recombinant proteins were biotin labeled using NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce Chemical Co.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ELISA Analysis of Protein Binding—AG1, VG1, LP, ovalbumin, or HA in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, was added to 96-well flat bottomed microtiter plates (20 μg/ml, 50 μl/well) and kept overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and blocked with PBST containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3 (blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, 50 μl of biotinylated protein at various concentrations ranging from 0.4 ng/ml to 4 μg/ml diluted in the above blocking buffer was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing the wells with PBST, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin, diluted 1:1,000 in the blocking buffer, was added and incubated for 1 h. To quantify binding, the alkaline phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate was added, and the absorbance was read at 405 nm in a microtiter plate reader. Slot Blot Analysis—2-fold serial dilutions of recombinant proteins (AG1 or VG1) in PBS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol, or PBS alone, were incubated at 55 °C for 15 min, then spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane using a 48-well Bio-Dot SF Microfiltration Apparatus (Bio-Rad). Ovalbumin was used as a control. The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.15 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), and 5% bovine serum albumin and washed three times with TBST. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated with 1 μg/ml biotinylated LP diluted in TBST and 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was applied, and bound LP was detected using an ECL substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—All SPR experiments were carried out at 25 °C using a BIAcore 1000 system (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) with a same running buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Polysorbate 20) at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. However, 5 μl/min was used for immobilization. Amine coupling kits and B1 and SA sensor chips were from BIAcore. Recombinant LP was immobilized on a B1 pioneer sensor chip using the amine coupling procedure. 80 μl of 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.2 m EDAC HCl mixture was injected over a flow cell for activation. 5 μg/ml recombinant LP diluted in 10 mm formic acid, pH 3.5, was immobilized onto a B1 sensor flow cell until the desired amount of protein was captured. Finally, 80 μl of 0.1 m ethanolamine HCl, pH 8.5, was injected over the flow cell to block the remaining activated carboxyl groups. Control surfaces were generated using the same procedure by replacing the protein with running buffer. For immobilization of HA to an SA sensor chip, 1 μg/ml biotinylated HA in running buffer was injected into a flow cell of an SA sensor chip at a flow rate of 5 μl/min until the desired amount of the biotinylated HA was captured. The control surface was also generated using the same procedure by replacing the biotinylated HA with running buffer. Different concentrations of recombinant proteins, diluted in the BIAcore running buffer, were injected over protein or HA-captured surface for 90 s for association, followed by a 300-s-long running buffer injection for dissociation. Parallel injections of analytes over a control surface were always performed for background measurements. The protein-captured surface was regenerated for subsequent injections by two successive injections of 100 μl of 10 mm HCl. The HA-captured surface was regenerated for subsequent injections by two successive injections of 100 μl of 25 mm HCl. SPR Studies on the Interactions of VG1 and AG1 as LP Complexes with HA—A solution of 500 nm VG1 or AG1 was mixed with a solution of 500 nm LP. Serial 2-fold dilutions of the starting solution were made, and each solution was then injected over biotinylated HA captured on a flow cell or over a blank control flow cell. The preincubation time of VG1 or AG1 with LP prior to their injection on the HA surface was at least 1 h. VG1, AG1, and LP at different concentrations (250, 125, and 62.5 nm) were injected over a pair of flow cells for comparison. BIAcore Data Analysis—Data were prepared using the SPRevolution software package (www.irb-bri.cnrc-nrc.gc.ca/rd/health/receptors/equipment_e.html). Sensorgrams generated using a control surface were subtracted from the corresponding experimental sensorgrams, and the resulting curves were transformed to concentration units. All curves were reduced to 500 evenly spaced sampling points. For each set of individual curves, corresponding to injections of various concentrations of protein over the same surface, integration was carried out by fitting the data to the simple binding model. Association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants were determined directly from the integration. The apparent dissociation equilibrium constant (Kd) was calculated as the koff/kon ratio. The schematic representations of the protein binding were prepared using the BIAevaluation software (version 3.1). The calculation of the association equilibrium constant (Ka) by Scatchard analysis was done by determining the slope of the maximum arbitrary resonance units (RUmax) reached at each concentration divided by the concentration, as a function of RUmax. Kd is equal to 1/Ka. The G1 domains of aggrecan (AG1) and versican (VG1) and LP were expressed as His-tagged recombinant proteins with their own signal peptide. The recombinant proteins were purified. Generally, 4 mg of recombinant VG1 and 1.5 mg of AG1 were obtained per liter of the medium; however, the yield of LP was so low that it was hard to obtain enough material for further studies. To improve expression and secretion efficiency, the LP signal sequence was replaced with the honeybee melittin signal sequence. This approach gave up to 500 μg of protein/liter of supernatant. The purity of the recombinant proteins was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The recombinant proteins were also characterized by Western blotting using a panel of antibodies (Fig. 1). N-terminal sequencing analysis showed that recombinant VG1 has a single N-terminal sequence (LHKVKVGKSPP—-) identical to that reported for the mature core protein, that the recombinant AG1 preparation contained two N-terminal sequences: VTVETSDHDNSLSV— and VETSDHDNSLSV—, representing the mature core protein and cleavage two residues downstream. For the two LP species, the slower migrating component gave an N-terminal sequence beginning DPDHLSDNYTL—, which corresponds to the native protein plus two additional residues (DP). These two extra residues were introduced by the replacement of the LP signal peptide with the honeybee melittin signal peptide. The faster migrating component contained an N-terminal sequence (IQANGH—) beginning with residue 17 of the mature LP. The molecular sizes of the three recombinant proteins on SDS-PAGE are larger than predicted for the proteins alone and are compatible with glycosylation, which is known to occur in insect cells. To determine whether VG1 binds to LP and HA in a manner similar to AG1, an ELISA was performed, where LP or HA was immobilized, and the ability to bind soluble biotinylated VG1 or AG1 was tested. Both LP and HA bound biotinylated VG1 (Fig. 2A) and AG1 (Fig. 2B) in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, no binding of biotinylated VG1 or AG1 to ovalbumin was detected. The inverse assay was performed where VG1 or AG1 or HA was immobilized, and the binding of soluble biotinylated LP was tested (Fig. 2C). Immobilized VG1 and AG1 both bound soluble biotinylated LP in a dose-dependent manner. The ability of LP to bind VG1 appeared to be stronger than for AG1 (EC50 = ∼60 ng/ml for VG1 versus >200 ng/ml for AG1), and the binding affinity of VG1 for HA was greater than that of AG1 (EC50 ∼250 ng/ml for VG1 versus > 1,500 ng/ml for AG1). The slot blot assay indicated that the incubation of VG1 and AG1 with β-mercaptoethanol completely abolished the binding activity to immobilized LP (Fig. 3). A reverse experiment indicated that the incubation of LP with β-mercaptoethanol also completely abolished its binding activity to either immobilized VG1 or AG1 (data not shown). These results demonstrate that disulfide bonds in VG1 and AG1 and LP are critical for maintaining intermolecular interactions. G1-LP Interaction—To investigate further the binding of VG1 and AG1 to LP, real time interactions of AG1 and VG1 with LP were analyzed by SPR. In a classical BIAcore experiment, one of the binding partners is immobilized in the matrix of a sensor chip surface, and the other interactant is injected over that sensor chip surface. As the injection is proceeding, a mass accumulation of the analyte (the injected species in BIAcore terminology), as it binds to the ligand (the immobilized species), causes an increase in the refractive index of the interfacing medium at the surface, and this is recorded in RU. The signal is proportional to the mass accumulation of the analyte. This corresponds to the wash-on phase of the experiment. The analyte solution is then replaced by buffer, and dissociation of the surface complexes is recorded (the wash-off phase). These steps generate a sensorgram, and from a set of sensorgrams at different analyte concentrations it is possible to derive kinetic parameters. In our experiment, the recombinant VG1 or AG1 (analyte) were flowed over immobilized recombinant LP (ligand). Experiments were performed at a flow rate of 100 μl/min to avoid any mass transport limitation. Parallel injections of VG1 or AG1 over a control surface on which no protein was immobilized were always performed as a reference. Fig. 4 shows representative overlays of sensorgrams of the binding of LP to VG1 (Fig. 4A) and to AG1 (Fig. 4B). Each set of curves represents injections of different concentrations of VG1 or AG1 over the same pair of flow cells (immobilized LP or control). The kinetic data (Table II) indicated that the association of VG1 with LP is 4.8-fold faster than AG1 with LP, and the dissociation rates are similar for both VG1 and AG1. This resulted in the apparent dissociation equilibrium constant for VG1 being 4.6-fold lower than for AG1.Table IIAssociation (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants and equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for the interactions of VG1 and AG1 with link protein and VG1, AG1, and link protein with hyaluronankonkoffKdmm-1 s-1s-1 × 10-3nmLink protein VG181.3 ± 5.11.30 ± 0.0616.0 ± 1.2 AG117.0 ± 0.81.24 ± 0.0372.7 ± 3.9Hyaluronan VG1351 ± 75.87 ± 0.1016.7 ± 0.3 AG129.2 ± 0.72.51 ± 0.0685.7 ± 2.0 Link protein65.4 ± 1.60.47 ± 0.027.2 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab HA Interactions—Biotinylated HA was captured onto an SA sensor chip surface. A control surface was generated by carrying out the same procedure but replacing biotinylated HA with running buffer. Fig. 5 shows representative overlay of sensorgrams of the binding of VG1 to HA (Fig. 5A), AG1 to HA (Fig. 5B), and LP to HA (Fig. 5C). The kinetic data (Table II) indicate that the association of VG1 with HA was 12-fold faster than AG1 and 5.4-fold faster than LP, and dissociation of LP from HA was 12.5-fold slower than VG1 and 5.3-fold slower than AG1. This resulted in the apparent dissociation constant for LP being the lowest and for AG1 being the highest. The results obtained for the interaction of VG1 binding to HA were also analyzed by Scatchard plot (data not shown). The calculations estimated the dissociation equilibrium constant Kd to be 40 nm, which is in good agreement with the Kd determined by global analysis using a simple model (Table II). Aggregate Interactions—To study the ability of LP to stabilize the interaction of versican and aggrecan with HA, VG1 or AG1 that had been preincubated with LP was injected over biotinylated HA. Sensorgrams were compared with those from the injection of VG1, AG1, and LP alone. In Fig. 6 A and B, curve 1 represents the injection of 250 nm VG1 (Fig. 6A) or AG1 (Fig. 6B). Curve 2 represents the injection of 250 nm LP. Curve 3 represent the injection of VG1 preincubated with LP (250 nm each, Fig. 6A) or AG1 preincubated with LP (250 nm each, Fig. 6B). Curve 4 represents the sum of curve 1 plus curve 2. The difference between curve 3 and curve 4 reflects the effect of interactions between VG1 (or AG1) and LP on the binding of both to HA. For VG1, the dissociation phases differed between curves 3 and 4 (Fig. 6A), indicating that LP primarily stabilizes the interaction of VG1 and HA. For AG1, the difference between curves 3 and 4 was evident throughout both the association and dissociation phases (Fig. 6B), suggesting that LP both promotes the association and reduces the dissociation of AG1·HA complexes. It is apparent that under the conditions used in this study, LP does not irreversibly stabilize the association of either VG1 or AG1 with HA; rather, a slow dissociation is observed. The baculovirus expression system used in this study gave yields of VG1 and AG1 in the range of 1–4 mg/liter, whereas LP was recovered in much lower amounts when the constructs contained their endogenous signal peptides. A low yield of LP in this expression system has been observed previously (15Grover J. Roughley P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Considerable improvement of the LP yield was obtained when an insect signal peptide was used to replace the endogenous mammalian sequence. The beneficial use of the insect signal peptide has been reported previously for other proteins (11Tessier D.C. Thomas D.Y. Khouri H.E. Laliberte F. Vernet T. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 98: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The recombinant VG1 and AG1 were recovered as intact proteins by N-terminal sequence analysis and size evaluation on SDS-PAGE, whereas the LP showed evidence of partial proteolytic processing at its N terminus. The cleavage site observed is the same as that generated by mammalian matrix metalloproteinases (16Nguyen Q. Murphy G. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which have not been reported to modify the G1 domain of aggrecan or versican. It is not clear in the insect cells which protease is responsible for this cleavage. However, there is no evidence that N-terminal truncation of LP alters its ability to interact with G1 domains or HA. It was also apparent that the insect cells generated G1 and LP possessing disulfide bonds that are essential for their functions, as occurs in the native proteins (17Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1980-1989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that they are glycosylated. All recombinant proteins used for analysis were analyzed at concentrations of less than 3.2 μm (about 160 μg/ml), to minimize the possibility of self-association interfering with the analyses. This is of particular concern in the case of LP where oligomerization in solution, which ultimately results in insolubility, has been reported (18Rosenberg L. Choi H.U. Tang L.H. Pal S. Johnson T. Lyons D.A. Laue T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7016-7024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our case the recombinant proteins were all fully soluble at the concentrations used. Furthermore when BIAcore analysis was used to assess the interaction of soluble LP with LP immobilized on a sensor chip, there was no evidence for any interaction (data not shown). It has been shown previously that the aggrecan G1 domain and LP can interact with each other and independently with HA (19Hascall V.C. J. Supramol. Struct. 1977; 7: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 20Caterson B. Baker J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the presence of cooperative interactions results in the formation of a stable ternary complex (21Buckwalter J.A. Rosenberg L.C. Tang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5361-5363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mörgelin M. Paulsson M. Hardingham T.E. Heinegård D. Engel J. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that the interaction of VG1 with either LP or HA is higher affinity than that of the AG1. In both cases this appears to be caused by a higher rate of association. It was also apparent that of all three proteins studied, LP has the highest affinity binding for HA, which is the result of its much lower rate of dissociation. Previous BIAcore studies had also indicated that the equilibrium dissociation constant for LP binding to HA was lower than that for AG1 binding to HA (23Watanabe H. Cheung S.C. Itano N. Kimata K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28057-28065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These results are in accord with studies demonstrating the relative insensitivity of the LP-HA interaction to changing pH from 7 to 5, in contrast to the decreased binding observed for aggrecan-HA interaction over the same pH range (24Rosenberg L. Tang L.H. Pal S. Johnson T.L. Choi H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18071-18077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, earlier studies using equilibrium dialysis and frontal gel chromatography had determined equilibrium dissociation constants for LP-HA and aggrecan-HA complexes to be in the 10–100 nm range, respectively (25Lyon M. Nieduszynski I.A. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 26Nieduszynski I.A. Sheehan J.K. Phelps C.F. Hardingham T.E. Muir H. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which agrees well with the present study. Very recently a BIAcore-based study has also compared the interaction of recombinant VG1 and AG1 with LP and HA (27Matsumoto K. Shionyu M. Go M. Shimizu K. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Watanabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41205-41212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Their values for the equilibrium dissociation constants for the interaction of VG1, AG1, and LP with HA are all in the same range and order as those shown in Table II, i.e. the equilibrium dissociation constants of the interaction with HA increase in the order, LP < VG1 < AG1. However, their results for the interaction of VG1 and AG1 with LP are different from those reported in the present study. Although both studies determined a similar equilibrium dissociation constant for the AG1 interaction with LP, in our study we found that the affinity of VG1 for LP was higher than that of AG1, whereas Matsumoto et al. (27Matsumoto K. Shionyu M. Go M. Shimizu K. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Watanabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41205-41212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) reported that the affinity of VG1 for LP is less than that for AG1. There are several potential reasons for this discrepancy, including the use of different sensor chips for BIAcore analysis and expression of recombinant proteins from different cell types. The B1 sensor chip used to study LP binding in the present work eliminated most of the nonspecific binding observed with the use of the CM5 chip and was therefore found to be a more reliable system. Variation could also arise from differences in recombinant protein structure, particularly glycosylation, resulting from the use of alternate expression systems. In this regard one might expect that the glycosylation pattern most resembling the native structure would result in the greatest binding affinity. It is therefore interesting to note that the equilibrium dissociation constant for the VG1-LP interaction obtained with the insect cell system in the present work was lower that that obtained with the human embryonic kidney 293 cell system. It is impossible to say whether either system generates the native glycosylation pattern as this may vary with age, site etc. It is apparent from the present studies that the complexes formed upon LP stabilization of VG1 or AG1 interaction with HA are not irreversible under the conditions of BIAcore analysis. This is not too surprising for any noncovalent interaction under the conditions of infinite dilution present during the wash-off phase of BIAcore analysis, when all noncovalent interactions should show some degree of dissociation, however small. The level of dissociation apparent in our work is consistent with that depicted in the paper by Matsumoto et al. (27Matsumoto K. Shionyu M. Go M. Shimizu K. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Watanabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41205-41212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). At first sight this would appear to contradict classical studies of proteoglycan aggregate stabilization by LP toward HA oligosaccharide-mediated dissociation (5Hardingham T.E. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 28Hascall V.C. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4242-4249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Franzén A. Björnsson S. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy could be caused by the high sensitivity of BIAcore analysis for monitoring low levels of dissociation. The differences in the ability of LP to interact with the versican and aggrecan G1 domains and stabilize their complexes raise the question of whether LP was indeed designed to function with both proteoglycans. This issue is of particular relevance at the present time because analysis of the human genome sequence has revealed the existence of four members of the LP family, with each LP gene residing adjacent to one of the members of the aggrecan family of proteoglycans (aggrecan, versican, brevican, and neurocan) (30Spicer A.P. Joo A. Bowling Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21083-21091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Perhaps surprisingly, the gene coding the cartilage LP used in this study resides adjacent to the versican gene (rather than that of aggrecan), even though aggrecan is by far the most abundant aggregating proteoglycan in cartilage. It is therefore possible that the cartilage LP is in fact designed to interact preferentially with versican because this proteoglycan and LP are present at low abundance in most tissues. This may explain the higher affinity of LP for this proteoglycan. At present there is no evidence for the presence of the LP that partners the aggrecan gene in cartilage, and there is no information on its ability to interact with the different proteoglycans. Interestingly, the LP gene that partners the brevican gene on chromosome 1 is expressed in brain (31Hirakawa S. Oohashi T. Su W.D. Yoshioka H. Murakami T. Arata J. Ninomiya Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 982-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), where brevican is preferentially located (32Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study shows that there are differences in the ability of the cartilage LP to interact with the versican and aggrecan G1 domains and stabilize the G1-HA interactions. For this in vitro observation to be of physiological significance, it is necessary that the proteoglycan-bound G1 domains behave in a manner similar to their free counterparts and that other components of the extracellular matrix do not influence these interactions. In addition, tissue concentrations of the proteoglycans can be much higher than those used in this in vitro work, particularly in the case of aggrecan which is present in the 10–20 μm range in human articular cartilage. Again, it is not clear whether the differences between G1 interactions will persist at the higher physiological concentrations. Although further studies will be required to validate the physiological relevance of these observations, it is clear that the versican and aggrecan G1 domains were not created to be functionally equivalent under all conditions.

McLachlan and Stewart (McLachlan, A. D., and Stewart, M. (1976) J. Mol.

Here we present the first direct experimental evidence in support of the α- and β-band hypothesis: we analyze the acrylamide quenching of the fluorescence of mutant tropomyosins containing 5-hydroxytryptophan residues at different positions along the coiled-coil structure under a variety of conditions (alone, complexed with actin, and complexed with actin and troponin with or without Ca2+). We show that fluorescent probes placed in the α-bands become less solvent-exposed in the absence of calcium, whereas those in the β-bands become less solvent-exposed in the presence of calcium.

The coiled-coil tertiary structure of Tm is derived from a heptad repeat in its primary structure (abcdefg) in which positions a and d are preferentially occupied by hydrophobic residues buried at the interface between the two α-helices. The other positions in the heptad repeat are occupied predominantly by hydrophilic residues, with charged residues at positions e and g often being involved in interhelical salt bridges (5Smillie L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1979; 4: 151-155Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Tm molecules polymerize in a head-to-tail fashion along the long pitch strands of F-actin filaments. One trimeric troponin (Tn) complex associates with the C-terminal half of Tm, which in turn spans seven actin monomers on each F-actin strand. Calcium binding to Tn triggers a series of conformational changes (6Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 7Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev.

The majority of models for Tm-mediated regulation of actomyosin activity assume that regulated thin filaments may exist in two or three biochemically distinguishable states, which are distinguished in part by the two or three distinct positions of Tm fibers along the actin filament: the “blocked” or “off” state, where Tm sterically blocks specific myosin binding to actin, the “off” or “closed” or “Ca2+-induced” state, which permits weak specific binding, and the “on” or “open” or “myosin-induced” state, in which strong rigor-like actomyosin cross-bridges may form (2Stewart M.

The binding of Ca2+ and/or myosin to regulated thin filaments can influence the equilibrium controlling the population of the thin filament conformational states (25Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. Arch.

Wakabayashi T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 241-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have suggested that Tm may kink at specific sites in response to Ca2+ such that different regions of a single Tm molecule may adopt different azimuthal positions on the actin surface. Recently (21Smith D.A. Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3155-3167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Smith D.A. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3168-3180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) a model was presented where Tm fibers associated with actin are treated as a weakly confined continuous flexible chain. Here, thermal fluctuations within a weak electrostatic potential result in kinks with dimensions that may be significantly smaller or larger than that of a full-length Tm molecule, thereby producing a range of orientations (permitted sinusoidal paths) of the Tm fiber along the actin filament. The degree of resolution of the above models, however, have so far been insufficient to address a fundamental and as yet unsolved question central to the understanding of thin filament-based regulation of muscle contraction: which Tm residues are involved in the binding to actin in the presence and absence of Ca2+ ions and/or myosin? The elucidation of these sites could reveal details of the conformational changes involving Tm in the thin filament. For example, the means by which Tm is translated between positions on the thin filament is still not clear: Tm could “roll” or “slide” across the actin surface. Tm rolling would involve a rotation of the coiled-coil superhelix with respect to actin and implies the use of different residues to bind actin in each state, as previously suggested (2Stewart M. McLachlan A.D. Nature. 1975; 257: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 271-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Tm sliding would imply the use of the same Tm surface to bind different sites on actin. Based on an analysis of the chemical nature of solvent-exposed residues in the Tm sequence, McLachlan and Stewart (23McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 271-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) identified 14 pseudo-repeats of 19–20 residues, which they divided into 7 pairs of α and β bands. They hypothesized that the α- and β-bands may in fact represent alternative 7-fold sets of sites that bind to complementary sites on the actin surface in the absence and presence of Ca2+. Because the ∼20-residue spacing between α- and β-bands correspond to an ∼90° rotation in the coiled-coil superhelix, this α- and β-band hypothesis implies a corresponding rolling of Tm triggered by the binding of Ca2+ to the thin filament. Bacchiocchi and Lehrer (28Bacchiocchi C. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1524-1536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed evidence for the rolling of Tm on the actin surface, based on frequency-domain fluorescence energy transfer data between 5-(2-iodoacetylaminoethylamino)naphtalene-1-sulfonic acid at Cys-190 of Tm and phalloidintetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate bound to F-actin. However, the preferential binding of specific Tm residues or surfaces to actin in a Ca2+-dependent manner, although a highly attractive model, remains as yet in want of direct experimental support. One efficient and direct method to localize specific contacts between two proteins is to place fluorescent probes at unique positions and measure the attenuation of fluorescence as a function of neutral quencher concentration (29Lehrer S.S. Leavis P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 49: 222-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 30Eftink M.R. Lakowicz J.R. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2.

Because protein-protein interfaces usually involve the exclusion of solvent and small solutes, the fluorescence of probes at binding sites is quenched with less efficiency than for those at solvent-exposed positions. Here we present the results of an extensive set of fluorescence quenching experiments using regulated muscle thin filaments reconstituted with recombinant Tms containing 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-OHW) probes at nine different positions. Our results are consistent with the model originally proposed by McLachlan and Stewart (23McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 271-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) in which Tm α-band residues interact with the actin surface in the absence of Ca2+, whereas β-band residues move toward actin in the presence of calcium.

Actin Binding Assay—Actin binding assays were performed in four different conditions: (i) Tm plus actin; (ii) Tm, actin, and Tn in the absence of calcium ions (presence of 1 mm EDTA); (iii) Tm, actin, Tn in the presence of calcium ions (1 mm CaCl2); and (iv) Tm and actin in the presence of 0.5 m acrylamide. Mutant 5OH90W, whose binding to actin is diminished by the presence of high concentrations of acrylamide, was also analyzed in the presence of acrylamide in the presence of Tn and calcium ions. Actin (7 μm), Tm (1 μm), and the Tn complex (1 μm) were dissolved in 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2,and1mm DTT. Each sample was ultracentrifuged in a Beckman Optima TLX ultracentrifuge (230,000 × g, 30 min, 25 °C). The initial mixture, the supernatant, and the pellet (resuspended in the original volume of assay buffer) were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Excitation and emission bandwidths were 1.0 and 5.0 nm, respectively, and excitation and emission wavelengths were 312 and 337 nm, respectively. Tm (1 μm), actin (7 μm), and the Tn complex (2 μm) were combined in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2,1mm DTT plus either 1 mm EGTA or 1 mm CaCl2. The solution was titrated with acrylamide up to 0.5 m. Data was analyzed using the modified Stern-Volmer relation for collisional and static quenching, Fo/F=(1+KSV[Q])eV[Q](Eq. 1) where Fo is the fluorescence of the sample in the absence of the quencher, F is the fluorescence as a function of acrylamide concentration [Q], KSV is the Stern-Volmer or dynamic quenching constant, and V is the static quenching constant (29Lehrer S.S.

Mutant Tms: Rationale of Design, Conformational Stability, Actin Binding, and Regulation of the Actomyosin Mg2+-ATPase—We have produced mutant ASTms (32Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A.

The mutants were named 5OH90W, 5OH94W, and so on (34Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10543-10551Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The original residues in the chicken skeletal Tm that were mutated are: Arg-90, Leu-94, Arg-101, Ala-107, Gln-111, Glu-122, Tyr-261, His-276, and Leu-278 (Fig. 1). ASTm and mutant tropomyosins all possess an N-terminal Ala-Ser extension, necessary to ensure native-like behavior in actin-binding, regulation, and polymerization assays (32Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C.

To avoid disrupting the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil with this bulky Trp analogue, all these residues are located in solvent-exposed positions b, c, e, or f, of the coiled-coil heptad repeat (Table I and Figs. 1 and 2). Positions 90, 94, 101, and 261 fall within the third or seventh α-band, whereas positions 107, 111, 122, 276, and 278 are located within the third or seventh β-band (Table I and Figs. 1 and 2). In this way these mutants allow us to probe a significant area of the exterior of the coiled-coil of Tm in two different regions.Table IDynamic (KSV) and static (V) quenching constants of 5-OHW probes at specific positions of the Tm structure in the presence of actin, Tn, and Ca2+ The effect of the introduction of the other proteins or of calcium ions on the fluorescence intensity is shown (Fo change).ConditionKSV/m-1Fo changeV/m-1ConditionKSV/m-1V/m-1Fo change90 (α/f)aPosition of the 5-OHW probe in the Tm primary sequence.

The horizontal lines represent a plane separating the two α-helices of the coiled-coil.

In these models, we have indicated the residues that were mutated to 5-OHW in the recombinant proteins. In Fig. 2 (A, B, D, and E) we assume that both Tm segments adopt a coiled-coil polypeptide backbone structure based on a Tm model (44Whitby F.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Proteins. 2000; 38: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, recent crystal (45Li Y. Mui S. Brown J.H. Strand J. Reshetnikova L. Tobacman L.S. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 2003; 84: 3181-3189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) structures of C-terminal fragments indicate that the C terminus of Tm may in fact not adopt a canonical coiled-coil structure. In both structures, the two α-helices splay apart over the last twenty residues. For this reason, in Fig. 2 (C and F) we present a model of the seventh α/β repeat in which residues 254–283 appear as found in the crystal structure (45Li Y. Mui S. Brown J.H. Strand J. Reshetnikova L. Tobacman L.S. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7378-7383Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We analyzed the effect of the mutations on the thermal stability of Tm. Thermal denaturation was accompanied by circular dichroism. All mutants except for 5OH90W presented a similar denaturation temperature (Tm ∼ 47 °C) to that observed for ASTm (Fig. 3). This indicates that the probes at these positions do not affect the global stability of the Tm molecule to a great deal. That these mutations may in fact be causing local changes in Tm structure and stability is witnessed by the observation that the 5OH90W mutant repeatedly aggregated at temperatures above 40 °C under the conditions tested. We do note, however, that the denaturation profile up to this temperature was similar to the other proteins tested (data not shown). These results indicate that, although the mutation promotes aggregation of the molecule at higher temperatures, its stability at lower temperatures seems to be similar to that of the other tropomyosin molecules tested. To determine the effect of the 5-OHW mutations on the regulatory properties of the mutant Tms, we first analyzed their capabilities to bind actin (Fig. 4). Actin binding assays were performed under four different conditions (Fig. 4): (i) Tm plus actin; (ii) Tm, actin, and Tn in the absence of free calcium ions (1 mm EDTA); (iii) Tm, actin, and Tn in the presence of calcium ions (1 mm CaCl2); and (iv) Tm and actin in the presence of 0.5 m acrylamide. All mutant Tms were able to bind actin on their own at levels comparable to that observed for ASTm in the absence of acrylamide (Fig. 4). All Tms also bound to actin in the presence of Tn complex in both the absence and presence of Ca2+. Because the fluorescence quenching assays (described below) were carried out in the presence of up to 0.5 m acrylamide, actin binding experiments were also carried out under these conditions (Fig. 4A, column 4). Only the mutant with 5-OHW at position 90 showed a significant reduction in its binding to actin in the presence of 0.5 m acrylamide (Fig. 4). However, in the presence of the Tn complex, 5OH90W was found to bind actin even in the pre"

Endothelial adhesion to fibronectin through αvβ3 integrins or the engagement and aggregation of luminal αvβ3 receptors by vitronectin triggers Ca2+ influx. However, the underlying signaling mechanisms are unknown. The electrophysiological basis of αvβ3 integrin-mediated changes in endothelial cell Ca2+ signaling was studied using whole cell patch clamp and microfluorimetry. The resting membrane potential of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells averaged -60 ± 3 mV. In the absence of intracellular Ca2+ buffering, the application of soluble vitronectin (200 μg/ml) resulted in activation of an outwardly rectifying K+ current at holding potentials from -50 to +50 mV. Neither a significant shift in reversal potential (in voltage clamp mode) nor a change in membrane potential (in current clamp mode) occurred in response to vitronectin. Vitronectin-activated current was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with the αvβ3 integrin antibody LM609 by exchanging extracellular K+ with Cs+ or by the application of iberiotoxin, a selective inhibitor of large-conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ channels. With intracellular Ca2+ buffered by EGTA in the recording pipette, vitronectin-activated K+ current was abolished. Fura-2 microfluorimetry revealed that vitronectin induced a significant and sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, although vitronectin-induced Ca2+ current could not be detected. This is the first report to show that an endothelial cell ion channel is regulated by integrin activation, and this K+ current likely plays a crucial role in maintaining membrane potential and a Ca2+ driving force during engagement and activation of endothelial cell αvβ3 integrin.

Integrins are a large family of membrane-spanning, cell adhesion proteins composed of α and β subunits, with over 18 α and 8 β subunits combining to form more than 24 different heterodimers (1Giancotti F.G.

In the vascular system, integrins play various roles in coordinating cell function, such as adhesion, spreading, and migration (3Luscinskas F.W. Lawler J.

Soluble αvβ3 integrin ligands are also capable of acutely regulating vascular tone. For example, synthetic peptides containing the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequence that binds αvβ3 integrin have been shown to block flow-induced, endothelium-dependent vasodilation in coronary arterioles (10Muller J.M. Chilian W.M. Davis M.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that soluble αvβ3 integrin ligands may acutely modulate blood flow by interacting with endothelial cell (EC) integrins (11Madden J.A. Christman N.J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2264-H2271PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bryan Jr., R.M. Marrelli S.P. Steenberg M.L. Schildmeyer L.A. Johnson T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2011-H2022Google Scholar). VN is a plasma glycoprotein first identified as a ligand of αvβ3 integrin and circulates at a concentration of 200-400 μg/ml in normal human plasma (13Germer M. Kanse S.M. Kirkegaard T. Kjoller L. Felding-Habermann B. Goodman S. Preissner K.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). VN can potentially interact with unbound αvβ3 integrin, and plasma levels of VN-containing complement complexes increase after complement activation. Adhesion to VN-covered substrates leads to an increase in EC intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (14Leavesley D.I. Schwartz M.A. Rosenfeld M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Acute application of VN or cross-linking of αvβ3 integrin with the αvβ3 antibody, LM609, also increases EC [Ca2+]i (15Bhattacharya S. Ying X. Fu C. Patel R. Kuebler W. Greenberg S. Bhattacharya J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The [Ca2+]i increase occurs as a consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1 following αvβ3 activation. It has been proposed that stimulation of αvβ3 integrin activates an unidentified Ca2+ influx pathway (14Leavesley D.I. Schwartz M.A. Rosenfeld M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 15Bhattacharya S. Ying X. Fu C. Patel R. Kuebler W. Greenberg S. Bhattacharya J. Circ.

The rapid effects of integrin activation on EC [Ca2+]i suggest that ion channels are involved in this response, and the purpose of the present study was to directly test this idea. Cell Culture—Bovine pulmonary artery ECs (BPAECs) were obtained at passage 1 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) and cultured on 35-mm plastic 6-well dishes in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, human epithelial growth factor (10 μg/liter), bovine brain extract, hydrocortisone (1 mg/liter), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), and heparin (25 units/ml). Cells between passages 4 and 9 were used for both patch clamp and microfluorimetry after trypsinization (0.25 mg/ml with EDTA) and plating on gelatin-coated coverslips 24-48 h prior to an experiment. Only single cells were studied in all protocols. Electrophysiology—Conventional whole cell current recordings were performed (21Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15035) Google Scholar) using an EPC-9 patch clamp system (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Continuous recordings of membrane potential (Em), membrane current (Im), cell capacitance, and/or seal resistance were simultaneously monitored using Pulse and X-Chart software (HEKA). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (catalog number 7040, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) with resistances of 3-8 megaohms. To determine current-voltage (I-V) relationships, 1-s voltage ramps from -120 to +60 mV or voltage steps between -120 and +20 mV in 20-mV increments (200 ms duration) were applied. Data were fitted using IGOR analysis routines (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Solutions and Reagents—The compositions of all solutions are listed in Table I. All experiments were performed at 35 °C using a bath temperature controller (HCC-100, Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). The calculated equilibrium potentials for the standard experimental conditions, solutions I-A (solution I in the pipette and solution A in the bath), were -84.1 mV for K+ (EK) and -32.8 mV for Cl- (ECl) at 35 °C.Table IComposition of solutionsIntracellularExtracellularIIIIIIIVABCDNaCl136136140TEA aspartate140KCl40401405.95.9CsCl5.9NMDG140Potassium aspartate100100CaCl20.41.81.810MgCl211111.21.21.2EGTA51Glucose101010 Open table in a new tab Monoclonal antibodies against αvβ3 integrin (LM609; catalog number MAB1976Z) and α5β1 integrin (catalog number MAB1999) were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Donkey anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Fura-2 and Fura-2 AM were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Bradykinin, thapsigargin, and La3+ were added to the appropriate solutions at the concentrations indicated in the Fig. 6 legend and applied to individual cells from wide-tipped glass micropipettes connected to a Picospritzer (Parker-Hannifin, Fairfield, NJ). The low shear stress associated with local solution exchange did not in itself induce changes in current (n = 4). Fura-2 Microfluorimetry—Measurements of Fura-2 fluorescence were performed as described previously (22Sharma N.R. Davis M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H267-H274PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, BPAECs on coverslips were loaded with 10 μmol/liter Fura-2/AM in solution A for 30 min at 25 °C, followed by washing for 10 min at 35 °C. Fluorescence emission at 510 nm associated with alternating 340/380-nm excitation (at ∼15 Hz) was used as an index of [Ca2+]i (23Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol.

Solution A was used for all Fura-2 experiments on cells, except for Ca2+-free bath protocols (solution C). Immunofluorescence Staining—BPAECs plated on gelatin-coated coverslips were fixed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing (in mmol/liter) 2.7 KCl, 1.5 KH2PO4, 157 NaCl, and 8 NaH2PO4 with 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixation was followed by five washes in PBS containing 0.1 mmol/liter glycine. The cells were permeabilized in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, rinsed five times, and incubated with or without αvβ3 or α5β1 integrin Ab (1:100 dilution), in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.9% sodium citrate, and 0.025% NaN3 for 60 min, followed by five rinses. Cells were then incubated in goat anti-mouse secondary IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 (1:300 dilution) for 60 min and rinsed five times. This was followed by phalloidin-rhodamine (1:50 dilution) treatment for 40 min to stain actin filaments. Images were collected using an Orca cooled-CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., Hamamatsu, Japan) and processed with Metamorph (Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA). Data Analysis—Analysis of variance was used to determine statistically significant differences between I-V curves. Scheffe's post hoc tests (24Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis. 2nd Ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ1984: 196-198Google Scholar) were used to compare differences between different groups at the same holding potentials. Paired and unpaired t tests were used to test differences between groups for Em or the reversal potential for whole cell current (Erev). Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Localization of αvβ3 and α5β1 Integrin on BPAECs—Consistent with previous reports (5Conforti G. Dominguez-Jimenez C. Zanetti A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Cremona O. Marchisio P.C. Dejana E. Blood. 1992; 80: 437-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Singh B. Fu C. Bhattacharya J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L217-L226PubMed Google Scholar), both αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins were expressed on BPAECs (Fig. 1). αvβ3 integrin was preferentially localized to focal adhesions at the tips of actin filaments (Fig. 1A), whereas α5β1 integrin tended to be distributed around the cell center (Fig. 1B), possibly at fibrillar adhesions (25Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar). Both types of integrins were abundant on the surface of BPAECs under the conditions used in our experiments. Vitronectin Activates a Whole Cell Current in BPAECs—The basic characteristics of unstimulated BPAECs in solutions I-A were as follows: cell capacitance = 29.8 ± 1 pF (n = 56); Em = -60.1 ± 3 mV (n = 42); Erev = -57.5 ± 3 mV (n = 52). In solutions I-A, BPAECs (n = 52) exhibited an inward rectifying K+ current as the predominant resting current with mean = -12.6 ± 1 pA/pF at holding potential (VH) = -120 mV. At VH = -50 mV, VN (200 μg/ml) activated a significant outward current (from 0.2 ± 0.1 to 5.0 ± 1 pA/pF) in 16 of 22 (73%) cells (Fig. 2A). The I-V relationships for the cells at rest and after activation of current by VN, as determined using voltage ramps, are shown in Fig. 2B. Whole cell currents in the presence of VN were outwardly rectifying and relatively large at voltages from -50 to +50 mV. The net current evoked by VN, after subtracting the resting inward rectifying current, is shown in Fig. 2, B and C. VN significantly increased the amplitude of the whole cell difference current from 1.7 ± 1 to 30.1 ± 5 pA/pF at VH = +60 mV (n = 16). This was associated with a slight shift in Erev to more negative potentials (-66.4 ± 2 to -70.6 ± 1 mV; n = 16). In a different series of experiments, Em was measured under current clamp conditions (n = 11). There was no significant difference between the average Em at rest, -64.4 ± 5 mV, and during VN stimulation, -65.3 ± 5 mV. These data suggest that the resting Em of BPAECs is determined by a K+ current and that VN activates a whole cell current whose Erev is close to EK. Vitronectin-activated Current Is Inhibited by αvβ3 Integrin Ab—To confirm that VN-activated current was mediated by αvβ3 integrin engagement, BPAECs were pretreated with integrin-specific antibodies prior to VN application. In the presence of LM609 (200 μg/ml), VN-induced current was completely inhibited (Fig. 3A; n = 5). However, pretreatment with α5β1 integrin Ab did not have a significant effect on VN-induced current (Fig. 3B; n = 4). These results suggest that VN-activated current results from the specific activation of αvβ3 integrin. Acute application of soluble LM609 alone failed to elicit any change in current (n = 5; data not shown). In a previous study of BPAECs, aggregation of αvβ3 integrin was required to initiate Ca2+ influx and [Ca2+]i increases (15Bhattacharya S. Ying X. Fu C. Patel R. Kuebler W. Greenberg S. Bhattacharya J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To test if aggregation of αvβ3 integrin by LM609 would stimulate current, BPAECs were pretreated with LM609 in solution A for 30 min at 25 °C, followed by acute application of secondary Ab (IgG, 200 μg/ml). However, this procedure failed to significantly activate current (n = 5, data not shown). Vitronectin-activated Current Is Carried by K+—The negative Erev of VN-induced current suggested that the current was carried primarily by K+. To test this assumption further, extracellular K+ was substituted with solutions I-B containing Cs+, an inhibitor of multiple K+ channels (26Nelson M.T. Quayle J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C799-C822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cs+ bath solution completely blocked both the inward rectifying current at rest and the VN-activated current (Fig. 4A; n = 8). In addition, VN did not significantly shift Erev from its more depolarized initial value (-46.3 ± 4 mV in Cs+ bath; -43.3 ± 5 mV during VN). The effect of iberiotoxin (IBTX), a selective inhibitor of large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (KCa) channels, was subsequently tested. In standard bath solution (solution A), IBTX (100 nmol/liter) completely inhibited the VN-activated outward current without significantly affecting the inward rectifying component of current (Fig. 4B). To further test if the VN-induced current was carried by K+, the net VN-induced current was measured at various extracellular K+ concentrations ([K+]o) equalling 5.9, 30, or 120 mmol/liter, and Erev was plotted as a function of [K+]o (Fig. 4C). As determined from the slope of the graph, Erev changed by 50.5 mV per 10-fold increase in [K+]o (Fig. 4C; solid line). The predicted slope for a pure K+ current at 35 °C is 61.1 mV per 10-fold increase in [K+]o (Fig. 4C; dotted line). In contrast, changing [Cl-]i by switching from solutions I-A (ECl = -32.8 mV) to III-A (ECl = -1.1 mV), with [K+]o = 5.9 mmol/liter in both cases, did not significantly shift Erev (Fig. 4C). Collectively, these results suggest that VN-evoked current is almost exclusively carried by K+ through a large conductance KCa channel. Vitronectin-activated Current Requires an Increase in Intra-cellular Ca2+—Agonist-induced increases in [Ca2+]i are known to activate K+ current in ECs (27Himmel H.M. Rasmusson R.L. Strauss H.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1338-C1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so the role of intracellular Ca2+ in mediating the effects of VN was tested. When intracellular Ca2+ was strongly buffered with 5 mmol/liter EGTA in the pipette (solutions II-A), VN failed to activate any significant current at VH = -50 mV (Fig. 5A). Periodic voltage ramps from -120 mV to +60 mV confirmed that there was no activation of current by VN at other potentials (Fig. 5B). The average I-V relationships with and without EGTA in the pipette solution are shown in Fig. 5C. Thus, VN-evoked current was completely abolished when intracellular Ca2+ was strongly buffered by EGTA. These results suggest that an increase in [Ca2+]i is required for activation of K+ current by VN. Mechanism of the VN-induced [Ca2+]i Increase—To test if VN would activate a non-voltage-gated Ca2+ current (ICa) that might contribute to secondary activation of a KCa channel, protocols were performed using solutions previously used to record store-operated cation currents (28Kelly J.J. Moore T.M. Babal P. Diwan A.H. Stevens T. Thompson W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L810-L819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using solutions IV-D, in which Ca2+ was the primary charge carrier (28Kelly J.J. Moore T.M. Babal P. Diwan A.H. Stevens T. Thompson W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L810-L819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Brough G.H. Wu S. Cioffi D. Moore T.M. Li M. Dean N. Stevens T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), ICa averaged -0.09 ± 0.01 pA/pF (VH = -120 mV) and Erev averaged -86 ± 6 mV in unstimulated cells (Fig. 6, A and F). One minute after application of VN (200 μg/ml), ICa was -0.07 ± 0.02 pA/pF (VH = -120 mV; Fig. 6, B and F) and Erev was -89 ± 11 mV. Neither value was significantly different from its corresponding value in unstimulated cells. Due to the absence of a clear response to VN, bradykinin (BK), an agonist known to induce Ca2+ release and influx (30Schilling W.P. Rajan L. Strobl-Jager E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12838-12848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Himmel H.M. Whorton A.R. Strauss H.C. Hypertension. 1993; 21: 112-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump (28Kelly J.J. Moore T.M. Babal P. Diwan A.H. Stevens T. Thompson W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L810-L819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Inesi G. Sagara Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), were used as positive controls. One minute after application of BK (1 μm), ICa averaged -0.13 ± 0.04 pA/pF (VH = -120 mV; Fig. 6, C and F) and Erev averaged -76 ± 10 mV. Neither value was significantly different from its corresponding value in unstimulated cells. In contrast, when TG (1 μm) was preloaded into the patch pipette, there was a rapid activation of inward current, which then partially inactivated and stabilized after ∼3 min (Fig. 6E). ICa peaked at -0.87 ± 0.08 pA/pF, and Erev shifted to +3 ± 1 mV (VH = -120 mV; Fig. 6, D and F) within 30 s after cell membrane rupture by pipette suction (Fig. 6E). The addition of 50 μm La3+ to the bath solution inhibited current activation (Fig. 6E) from -0.87 ± 0.08 to -0.09 ± 0.01 pA/pF (VH = -120 mV) and shifted Erev from +2.8 ± 1 back to -86.8 ± 2 mV (n = 5). To test if VN would elevate [Ca2+]i, even though VN-induced ICa activation could not be detected, VN was applied to non-voltage clamped BPAECs loaded with Fura-2/AM. Indeed, VN (200 μg/ml) induced a significant [Ca2+]i increase in BPAECs (Fig. 7A), as reported previously (15Bhattacharya S. Ying X. Fu C. Patel R. Kuebler W. Greenberg S. Bhattacharya J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). LM609 alone did not significantly alter [Ca2+]i, as reported in the same study (15Bhattacharya S. Ying X. Fu C. Patel R. Kuebler W. Greenberg S. Bhattacharya J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), nor was a significant [Ca2+]i increase detected in LM609-pretreated cells when a secondary Ab (anti-mouse IgG, 200 μg/ml) was applied to aggregate αvβ3 integrin (although several different durations and temperatures for LM609 pretreatment were tested). Because the magnitude of the VN-induced [Ca2+]i increase was rather modest, BK and TG were used as positive controls known to elevate EC [Ca2+]i (31Himmel H.M. Whorton A.R. Strauss H.C. Hypertension. 1993; 21: 112-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 33Kawasaki J. Hirano K. Hirano M. Nishimura J. Fujishima M. Kanaide H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 373: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Both 1 μmol/liter BK (Fig. 7B) and 1 μmol/liter TG (Fig. 7C) induced significant and sustained [Ca2+]i increases, with the TG response (210 ± 22%, n = 6) being substantially higher than that for VN (118 ± 4%, n = 8) or BK (138 ± 12%, n = 5) (Fig. 7D). These sustained [Ca2+]i increases required Ca2+ influx, because they were prevented when [Ca2+]o was absent from the bath solution (solution C; Fig. 7C). A novel finding of this study is that the interaction between αvβ3 integrin and the extracellular matrix protein VN results in rapid activation of at least one type of endothelial cell ion channel. The following observations suggest that the major VN-activated current is a KCa current. (i) Neither Erev nor Em significantly shifted from EK (-84.1 mV) during VN application. (ii) Erev for VN-activated current shifted with changes in [K+]o close to what would be predicted for a pure K+ current. (iii) VN-activated K+ current was completely inhibited by buffering intracellular Ca2+. (iv) VN-activated K+ current was blocked by Cs+ and IBTX. Activation of the KCa current by VN did not appear to substantially hyperpolarize cultured BPAECs due to their already negative resting membrane potentials (-64 mV), but it would be predicted to hyperpolarize other ECs with more positive resting potentials (34Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19938-19944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sharma N.R. Davis M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H156-H164PubMed Google Scholar, 36Vaca L. Licea A. Possani L.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C819-C824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a Ca2+ current directly activated by VN could not be detected, our collective electrophysiological and microfluorimetric data suggest that a Ca2+-permeable channel is also activated by VN in these cells and that its activation underlies the plateau phase of the VN-stimulated [Ca2+]i increase. These results show, for the first time, that ion channels in ECs are rapidly activated in response to EC integrin interaction with an extracellular matrix protein. This points to a new mechanism for the control of vascular resistance under physiological conditions and during adaptive responses to vascular injury. Mechanisms of Activation of K+ Current by αvβ3 Integrin—The mechanism underlying VN-activated K+ current may be similar to those of other K+ currents activated by agonists. By measuring whole cell current and [Ca2+]i simultaneously in bovine aortic EC (BAEC), Himmel et al. (27Himmel H.M. Rasmusson R.L. Strauss H.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1338-C1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that several agonists, including BK, induced [Ca2+]i increases and subsequently activated K+ current. BK-induced current was completely abolished after intracellular Ca2+ chelation with EGTA, similar to our results for VN. There are some differences, however, between the characteristics of the current activated by BK and VN. In BAEC, BK not only activated a K+ current but also Cl- and non-selective cation currents that were dependent on the [Ca2+]i increase. Thus, BK shifted Erev from -79 to -63 mV, away from EK (-83 mV) (27Himmel H.M. Rasmusson R.L. Strauss H.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1338-C1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our study of BPAECs, VN tended to shift Erev toward a more negative potential (-66 mV to -71 mV), which is consistent with more selective activation of a K+ current. Indeed, significant activation of another current during K+ channel inhibition by Cs+ could not be detected, and IBTX, a selective blocker of large conductance KCa channels, inhibited the VN-activated current. Recent studies have revealed that integrin ligands acutely regulate several types of ion channels (16Wildering W.C. Hermann P.M. Bulloch A.G.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2419-2426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lin B. Arai A.C. Lynch G. Gall C.M. J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Kramar E.A.

Davis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Hofmann G. Bernabei P.A. Crociani O. Cherubini A. Guasti L. Pillozzi S. Lastraioli E. Polvani S. Bartolozzi B. Solazzo V. Gragnani L. Defilippi P. Rosati B. Wanke E. Olivotto M. Arcangeli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4923-4931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For example, integrins have been found to modulate KCa current in at least two different types of cells. Attachment of fibronectin-coated beads to leukemia cells led to hyperpolarization (37Arcangeli A. Becchetti A. Del Bene M.R. Wanke E. Olivotto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), an effect most likely mediated by activation of KCa current. However, this effect was not completely abolished by strong intracellular Ca2+ buffering (38Becchetti A. Arcangeli A. Del Bene M.R. Olivotto M. Wanke E. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1992; 248: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); therefore, the KCa current was probably not activated by an increase in [Ca2+]i but by another mechanism such as channel phosphorylation. Mechanical stimulation of human articular chondrocytes through β1 integrins was shown to induce membrane hyperpolarization by autocrine production of interleukin-4 (39Salter D.M. Robb J.E. Wright M.O. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 40Battistella-Patterson A.S. Wang S. Wright G.L. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1997; 75: 1287-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The hyperpolarization in that case was due to activation of apamin-sensitive, small conductance KCa channels and was blocked by pretreatment with β1 integrin Ab (41Millward-Sadler S.J. Wright M.O. Lee H. Nishida K. Caldwell H. Nuki G. Salter D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether an increase in [Ca2+]i was critical to that response, because [Ca2+]i changes were not measured or prevented in those experiments. Collectively, these studies suggest that integrin engagement and activation can result in KCa channel activation by several different pathways. Intracellular signal transduction by integrins usually involves tyrosine kinase activation (1Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3739) Google Scholar). Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest that non-receptor tyrosine kinases directly regulate KCa channels. In Chinese hamster ovary cells co-transfected with prolactin receptors and KCa channels, the addition of prolactin led to channel activation that persisted after patch excision and was inhibited by an antibody to Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK2) (42Prevarskaya N.B. Skryma R.N. Vacher P. Daniel N. Djiane J. Dufy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24292-24299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the channels were directly regulated by JAK2 or a downstream kinase. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, co-expression of KCa channels with c-Src, another non-receptor tyrosine kinase, led to Ca2+-sensitive enhancement of K+ current (43Ling S. Woronuk G. Sy L. Lev S. Braun A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30683-30689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This enhancement was mediated by phosphorylation of residue Tyr-766 on the C-terminus of the channel's α-subunit. Interestingly, both phosphorylation of the channel and potentiation of current were more pronounced at high levels of intracellular Ca2+ (43Ling S. Woronuk G. Sy L. Lev S. Braun A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30683-30689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is possible that the KCa current activated by VN-αvβ3 interaction in BPAECs may also involve a Ca2+-sensitive, tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway. Whether this mechanism involves phosphorylation of a specific C-terminal tyrosine residue on the BKCa channel remains to be investigated. Our observation that VN-activated K+ current is blocked by EGTA does not preclude direct regulation of the channel by tyrosine phosphorylation if that process also requires a relatively high [Ca2+]i (43Ling S. Woronuk G. Sy L. Lev S. Braun A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30683-30689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated Ca2+ Signaling in ECs—Cheresh and coworkers (14Leavesley D.I. Schwartz M.A. Rosenfeld M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) first reported VN-induced [Ca2+]i increases in human umbilical vein ECs as they adhered to a VN-covered substrate. Based on the use of pharmacological inhibitors, the [Ca2+]i increase was attributed to activation of a non-voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. Bhattacharya et al. (15Bhattacharya S. Ying X. Fu C. Patel R. Kuebler W. Greenberg S. Bhattacharya J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) demonstrated that both VN and cross-linking of αvβ3 integrin by LM609 increased [Ca2+]i in BPAECs. The [Ca2+]i increase occurred as a consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1 and an increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels that would induce Ca2+ release from Ca2+ stores. However, Ca2+ influx was required for sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i. The mechanism for Ca2+ entry was not shown, because neither study examined changes in the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying the [Ca2+]i increase. Conceptually, integrin activation could increase [Ca2+]i by increasing the driving force for passive calcium entry or by activating an ion channel or transporter to alter Ca2+ conductance. In other types of non-excitable cells, multiple lines of evidence suggest that integrin activation increases Ca2+ conductance by activating a Ca2+-permeable ion channel. For example, thrombin application in human platelets leads to increased Ca2+ channel activity via activation of αIIbβ3 integrin (44Fujimoto T. Fujimura K. Kuramoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16370-16375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, the application of beads coated with the RGD peptide elicits an [Ca2+]i increase that correlates with bead adhesion, suggesting the involvement of integrins in regulating Ca2+ homeostasis (45Sjaastad M.D. Angres B. Lewis R.S. Nelson W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8214-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 46Sjaastad M.D. Lewis R.S. Nelson W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1025-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our observation that the Erev of VN-activated current did not shift exactly as predicted for a pure K+ current (Fig. 4C) suggests that another ion channel is also activated by VN. In non-excitable cells, including ECs, a store-operated Ca2+ current (ICa) is considered to play a predominant role in controlling Ca2+ influx (47Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 48Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem.

Nilius B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Some laboratories have been able to detect this current (28Kelly J.J. Moore T.M. Babal P. Diwan A.H. Stevens T. Thompson W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L810-L819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Fasolato C. Nilius B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Droogmans G. Van Driessche W. Nilius B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 428: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 53Fierro L. Lund P.E. Parekh A.B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 440: 580-587PubMed Google Scholar). In ECs, the amplitude of ICa is typically very small (∼ -0.1 pA/pF at VH = 0 mV), even in response to a non-physiological stimulus such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate inclusion in the pipette (50Fasolato C. Nilius B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To detect ICa following αvβ3 integrin activation, intracellular solutions containing weakly buffered free Ca2+ and extracellular solutions containing high Ca2+ in the absence of any other membrane-permeable cations (solutions IV-D) were used. Under the same conditions, supra-physiological stimulation with TG activated an easily detectable ICa of -0.87 pA/pF (VH = -120 mV). However, no significant ICa could be detected in response to VN or BK, even though both agents produced small but sustained [Ca2+] increases. The VN and BK responses could reflect intracellular Ca2+ release only and/or weak activation of ICa below the detection threshold of whole cell current recording. In conclusion, we report for the first time that engagement of αvβ3 integrin by an extracellular matrix protein leads to activation of an endothelial cell K+ current. The current has the characteristics of a KCa channel that is activated secondary to Ca2+ influx and/or release. Activation of whole cell KCa current following integrin engagement would hyperpolarize the endothelium, particularly in electrically coupled ECs in vivo, where the resting Em is relatively depolarized (54Daut J. Mehrki G. Nees S. Newman W.H. J. Physiol. 1988; 402: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This would sustain the plateau phase of the [Ca2+]i transient by enhancing the electrochemical driving force for Ca2+ (34Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W. J. Biol.

Thus, αvβ3 engagement by extracellular matrix proteins is predicted to regulate production of Ca2+-dependent EC vasoactive substances such as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF), nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and endothelin and thereby acutely modulate vascular tone (10Muller J.M.

In this way, VN and other αvβ3 integrin ligands have the potential to acutely regulate the local circulation. Judy Davidson gave extensive assistance in preparing and proofreading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2006069995,"The neurofibromatosis type 1 tumor suppressor protein neurofibromin, is a GTPase activating protein for H-, N-, K-, R-Ras and TC21/R-Ras2 proteins. We demonstrate that Schwann cells derived from Nf1-null mice have enhanced chemokinetic and chemotactic migration in comparison to wild-type controls. Surprisingly, this migratory phenotype is not inhibited by a farnesyltransferase inhibitor or dominant-negative (dn) (N17)H-Ras (which inhibits H-, N-, and K-Ras activation). We postulated that increased activity of R-Ras and/or TC21/R-Ras2, due to loss of Nf1, contributes to increased migration. Mouse Schwann cells (MSCs) express R-Ras and TC21/R-Ras2 and their specific guanine exchange factors, C3G and AND-34. Infection of Nf1-null MSCs with a dn(43N)R-Ras adenovirus (to inhibit both R-Ras and TC21/R-Ras2 activation) decreases migration by approximately 50%. Conversely, expression of activated (72L)TC21/R-Ras2, but not activated (38V)R-Ras, increases migration, suggesting a role of TC21/R-Ras2 activation in the migration of neurofibromin-deficient Schwann cells. TC21/R-Ras2 preferentially couples to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and MAP kinase pathways. Treatment with a PI3-kinase or MAP kinase inhibitor reduces Nf1-null Schwann cell migration, implicating these TC21 effectors in Schwann cell migration. These data reveal a key role for neurofibromin regulation of TC21/R-Ras2 in Schwann cells, a cell type critical to NF1 tumor pathogenesis."

Autocrine production of NGF maintains the survival of CESS cells through the continuous deactivation of p38 MAPK, an enzyme able to induce Bcl-2 phosphorylation and subsequent cytochrome c release and caspase activation. In this paper, we show that NGF induces transcriptional activation and synthesis of MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1), a dual specificity phosphatase that dephosphorylates p38 MAPK, thus preventing Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, NGF increases MKP-1 protein stability by preventing its degradation through the proteasome pathway.

E. Marcocci, P. Rosini, M. Torica, and F. Cozzolino, manuscript in preparation. causes cytochrome c release from mitochondria, caspase activation, and apoptotic death. In contrast, the addition of exogenous NGF induces dephosphorylation of p38 MAPK, which prevents Bcl-2 phosphorylation and cell apoptosis. Continuous deactivation of p38 MAPK and maintenance of the functional and structural properties of Bcl-2 protein appear to be important mechanisms underlying the survival-promoting activity of endogenous NGF. MAPKs including ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK are activated by upstream kinases such as MEKs 1 and 2 and mitogen kinase kinases 3, 4, and 6 (16Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Science's STKE. 1999; Google Scholar). However, once activated, MAPKs are rapidly inactivated by selected families of protein phosphatases. In particular, dual specificity protein phosphatases play crucial roles in the dephosphorylation/inactivation of MAPKs (17Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Google Scholar, 18Sun H. Tonks N.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 480-485Google Scholar). MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1), also termed CL100 or DUSP1, is a prototypic member of the family of inducible dual specificity phosphatases, dsPTPs (19Alessi D.R. Smythe C. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2015-2020Google Scholar, 20Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Google Scholar). It selectively dephosphorylates tyrosine and threonine residues on MAPKs and inactivates them. Although all three MAPKs are potential targets of MKP-1 (21Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Google Scholar, 22Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Google Scholar, 23Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Google Scholar), it has been reported that JNK and p38 MAPK are preferentially inactivated by this enzyme (21Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Google Scholar). Other members of the family of inducible dsPTPs, such as MKP-3 and MKP-4, show higher selectivity to ERK, rather than JNK/SAPK or p38 MAPK, suggesting the presence of an expanding family of structurally homologous dsPTPs possessing distinct MAPK specificity and subcellular localization as well as diverse patterns of tissue expression (20Keyse S.M.

In particular, MKP-1 and MKP-2, which are not expressed in quiescent cells, are rapidly induced following serum addition, the proteins being detectable as early as 30 (MKP-1) or 60 min (MKP-2) after stimulation (27Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1368-1376Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that in CESS cells NGF is able to increase gene expression and synthesis of MKP-1, one of the most active p38 MAPK-dephosphorylating enzymes, and inhibits its degradation through the proteasome pathway, thus increasing the concentration of active MKP-1. Furthermore, we show that following NGF stimulation, MKP-1 localizes also on mitochondria, suggesting an interaction with p38 MAPK in this compartment. Incubation of CESS cells with MKP-1-specific antisense oligonucleotides induces cell death not prevented by exogenous NGF. By contrast, overexpression of native MKP-1, but not of its catalytically impaired form, inhibits apoptosis induced by NGF neutralization in CESS cells. Reagents—Human recombinant β-nerve growth factor, SB203580-p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB202474, K252a-Trk-A inhibitor, and proteasome inhibitor lactacystin were purchased by Calbiochem.

All of the other materials were purchased from either Sigma or Merck-Eurolab. Cell Culture—CESS cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated by using RNAFast reagent (Molecular Systems). Approximately 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed in a total volume of 20 μl of specific buffer containing 50 ng of random hexamers, 1 mm dNTPs, 20 units of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), and 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Finnzymes) for 1 h at 37 °C. 2 μl of reverse transcription reaction was amplified by Dynazyme II DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) in the appropriate reaction buffer supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm dNTPs using the following primers: 5′-GCG GGA AAT CGT GCG TGA CAT T-3′ and 5′-GAT GGA GTT GAA GGT AGT TTC GTG-3′ for β-actin; and 5′-CCG GAG CTG TGC AGC AAA-3′ and 5′-CTC CAC AGG GAT GCT CTT-3′ for MKP-1, yielding a PCR products of 234 and 282 bp, respectively. PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels with 100-bp Ladder marker (Invitrogen) and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Plasmid Construction and Cell Transfection—The human full-length MAPK phosphatase-1 coding sequence was amplified by PCR with primers DUSP1-FW (5′-GCT AGC AGA TCT ATG GTC ATG GAA GTG GGC ACC-3′) and DUSP1-RV (5′-GCT AGC AAG GAT CCG CAG CTG GGA GAG GTC GTA ATG GG-3′) using total cDNA of CESS cell line as template. The PCR fragment was subcloned in pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), yielding the p14-DUSP1 plasmid. pMEC10R plasmid coding for MKP-1/EGFP fusion protein under the CMV promoter was constructed by ligating in pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) in-frame to the N terminus of EGFP, the 1.1-kb NheI fragment from p14DUSP1 containing the MKP-1 sequence. Transiently transfected cells were obtained using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) by following manufacturer's instructions. Catalytically impaired form (Cys258 to Ser) of MKP-1 was obtained by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primers 5′-AGG GTG TTT GTC CAC AGC CAG GCA GGC ATT TCC-3′ and 5′-GGA AAT GCC TGC CTG GCT GTG GAC AAA CAC CCT-3′ and the pMEC10R plasmid as cDNA template. All of the products were sequenced by BigDye Terminator kit (Applied Biosystem). Immunoprecipitation Analysis—For immunoprecipitation studies, 107 cells cultured in the presence of 10 μm lactacystin with or without 10 nm hrNGF were lysed in 10 mm Hepes, 142.5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1mm EGTA, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 30 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 200 μg of cell lysate (as assessed by Bradford assay) were precleared with protein A-Sepharose and immunoprecipitated with 2 μg/ml rabbit anti-ubiquitin or rabbit anti-MKP-1 or control IgG followed by protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with PBS, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, run on 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose filter, and stained with anti-MKP-1 antibody or anti-ubiquitin antibody. Reaction was detected with ECL. Purification of Nuclear, Mitochondrial, and Cytosolic Fraction—108 cells were suspended in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin for 30 min on ice, Dounce-homogenized, and centrifuged at 750 × g at 4 °C to obtain the nuclear fraction. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to obtain the mitochondrial fraction (pellet) and the cytosolic fraction (supernatant). For Western blot analysis, the nuclear and mitochondrial fractions were directly lysed in sample buffer, whereas the cytosolic fraction was vacuum-concentrated and subsequently suspended in sample buffer. The purity of each fraction was assessed by staining aliquots with Abs to HSP60 for mitochondria, to actin for cytosol, and to PARP for nuclei. Immunoblot Analysis—2 × 106 cells were lysed on ice in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 30 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 0.25% Triton X-100, pH 7.4. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min and stored at -80 °C for further analyses, and protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Equivalent amounts of proteins were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 90 °C for 3 min, loaded on 8% (for PARP analysis) or 12% (for MKP-1 and p38 MAPK analysis) SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and incubated with 1 μg/ml of primary antibodies diluted in TBS-T containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS-T, membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:1000 in TBS-T containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed with TBS-T, and developed in ECL reagent. When necessary, membranes were stripped by heating at 56 °C in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, with 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS. Antisense Assays—CESS cells were plated in 6-well plates in serum-free medium at the concentration of 106cells/well. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (MWG Biotech) were used for all of the antisense transfection experiments. Appropriate amounts of the oligonucleotides were diluted in 200 μl of serum-free medium. 5 μl of LipofectAMINE were added to each tube and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to allow LipofectAMINE reagent-DNA complex formation. The transfection mixtures were added to the wells and incubated for 5 h in serum-free medium. 10% fetal bovine serum then was added, and incubation was prolonged for different times (24–72 h). The cultures were washed in PBS and lysed as described above. The phosphorothioate oligonucleotides used were as follows: p38 MAPK antisense, 5′-gtC TTG TTC AGC TCC tgc-3′; p38 MAPK sense, 5′-gcA GGA GCT GAA CAA gac-3′; p38 MAPK scrambled, 5′-tgC TTA GTT CTC GTC cgc-3′ (28Kiemer A.K. Weber N.C. Furst R. Bildner N. Kulhanek-Heinze S. Vollmar A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 874-881Google Scholar); MKP-1 antisense, 5′-ccC ACT TCC ATG ACC Atg g-3′; MKP-1 sense, 5′-ccA TGG TCA TGG AAG Tgg g-3′; and MKP-1 scrambled, 5′-gcA GGA CGT GCT AGA ggg-3′. Survival Assay—Approximately 5 × 103 cells/well were seeded in triplicate onto 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium and incubated for 24 h with 10 μm phosphorothioate anti-MKP-1 or control oligonucleotides. NGF then was added at the final concentration of 10 nm, and cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. Detection of MTT reduction was performed as described previously (29Shearman M.S. Ragan C.I. Iversen L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1470-1474Google Scholar). MTT was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml for 4 h. 100 μl of lysis buffer (20% SDS, 50% N,N-dimethylformamide, pH 7.4) and 100 μl of isopropyl alcohol were added to each well, and colorimetric reaction was measured by spectrophotometric analysis by using a 570-nm filter. Immunofluorescence Analysis—For immunofluorescence analysis, CESS cells were transiently transfected with pEMC10R or vector alone for 24 h, washed in PBS, and plated on poly-l-lysine-sensitized glass slides (Lab-Tek Chamber Slide, Nalge Nunc International) in serum-free medium. Cells were treated or not with 10 nm NGF for 30 min at 37 °C, labeled with 25 nm Mitotracker (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), washed twice with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After washing with PBS, nuclei were stained with Hoechst (Molecular Probes) and slides were analyzed by a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Relevance of p38 MAPK Activation in Cell Apoptosis Induced by NGF Withdrawal—The sIgG+ CESS B cell line originates from an antigen-selected somatically hypermutated, proliferating B lymphocyte, a stage ontogenetically close to that of memory B cells. Similar to memory B lymphocytes, CESS cells spontaneously produce NGF, express high and low affinity NGF receptors, and utilize NGF as an autocrine survival factor. Inhibition of endogenous NGF activity through neutralizing antibodies to NGF or use of the specific Trk-A inhibitor K252a (30Knusel B. Hefti F. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1987-1996Google Scholar) induces apoptotic cell death via a p38 MAPK-mediated Bcl-2 phosphorylation, an event that induces cytochrome c release and caspase activation (1Rosini P. De Chiara G. Lucibello M. Garaci E. Cozzolino F. Torcia M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 753-759Google Scholar, 4Torcia M. De Chiara G. Nencioni L. Ammendola S. Labardi D. Lucibello M. Rosini P. Marlier L.N. Bonini P. Dello S.P. Palamara A.T. Zambrano N. Russo T. Garaci E. Cozzolino F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39027-39036Google Scholar). Fig. 1, panel A, shows that SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK (31Lee J.C. Kassis S. Kumar S. Badger A. Adams J.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 389-397Google Scholar), is able to inhibit the apoptotic effect of NGF neutralization on CESS cells measured as caspase-3-like-mediated cleavage of PARP, whereas the inactive molecule SB202474 did not. The involvement of p38 MAPK in apoptosis induced by NGF neutralization was revealed also by using antisense oligonucleotides specific to p38 MAPK (28Kiemer A.K. Weber N.C. Furst R. Bildner N. Kulhanek-Heinze S. Vollmar A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 874-881Google Scholar). CESS cells were transfected for 48 h with 10 or 30 μm anti-p38 MAPK-specific oligonucleotides or with the same concentrations of sense or scrambled oligonucleotides as control. Fig. 1, panel B, shows that antisense oligonucleotides induced a decrease of p38 MAPK synthesis with a maximum effect at a concentration of 30 μm (≈60% decrease). Next, CESS cells were again transfected with 30 μm antisense oligonucleotides and incubated with 100 nm K252a as NGF-neutralizing agent for 6 h. The cells were then lysed and blotted with anti-PARP antibodies as a measure of caspase activation. Fig. 1, panel C, shows that antisense oligonucleotides to p38 MAPK completely abolished PARP cleavage induced by K252a incubation, whereas sense or scrambled oligonucleotides did not. The above data confirm that p38 MAPK activation is necessary in cell apoptosis induced by NGF neutralization and support the contention that endogenous NGF exerts its survival factor function through a pathway involving p38 MAPK deactivation. NGF Induces p38 MAPK Dephosphorylation and MKP-1 Expression—Stimulation of B lymphocytes with NGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the two isoforms, p42 and p44, of Erk (32Franklin R.A. Brodie C. Melamed I. Terada N. Lucas J.J. Gelfand E.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4965-4972Google Scholar) as well as p38 MAPK dephosphorylation (4Torcia M. De Chiara G. Nencioni L. Ammendola S. Labardi D. Lucibello M. Rosini P. Marlier L.N. Bonini P. Dello S.P. Palamara A.T. Zambrano N. Russo T. Garaci E. Cozzolino F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39027-39036Google Scholar). To study the effect of NGF on phosphorylation status of MAPK, we cultured CESS cells in serum-free conditions for 4 h and stimulated them with 10 nm hrNGF for different times (from 10 min to 1 h). The phosphorylation status of ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK was then studied by immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for the phosphorylated enzymes. Fig. 2 shows that, under these experimental conditions, the activated forms of p38 MAPK and ERK were detected in unstimulated cultures. Activated JNK was never detected (data not shown). NGF stimulation had opposite effects on p38 and ERK, because it promptly induced p38 MAPK dephosphorylation, whereas ERK was instead strongly activated. 1 h after NGF stimulation, p38 MAPK continued to be dephosphorylated, whereas ERK phosphorylation kept returning to the base-line level. These results suggest the action of specific MAPK phosphatases with different activity toward ERK and p38 MAPK and are consistent with data generated using memory B lymphocytes (4Torcia M. De Chiara G. Nencioni L. Ammendola S. Labardi D. Lucibello M. Rosini P. Marlier L.N. Bonini P. Dello S.P. Palamara A.T. Zambrano N. Russo T. Garaci E. Cozzolino F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39027-39036Google Scholar). Among MAPK phosphatase family members known to deactivate p38 MAPK (33Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Google Scholar), MKP-1 and MKP-3 were reported to be induced by NGF in embryonic sympathetic neurons and in PC12 cells (34Peinado-Ramon P. Wallen A. Hallbook F. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 256-267Google Scholar). Whereas MKP-3 interacts preferentially with ERK MAPK (35Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Google Scholar), it has been reported that JNK and p38 MAPKs were preferentially inactivated by MKP-1 with the following order of affinity, p38 MAPK > JNK > ERK (21Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Google Scholar). Furthermore, MKP-1 is encoded by an immediate early gene and is rapidly induced by many of the stimuli that activate MAPKs (20Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Google Scholar). For these reasons, we focused our attention on MKP-1. To investigate whether NGF is able to activate MKP-1 gene expression, CESS cells were starved from serum for 2 h and cultured in the presence or absence of 10 nm hrNGF for different times. mRNA was extracted, and MKP-1 gene expression was analyzed by PCR with specific oligonucleotides. Fig. 3 panel A shows that MKP-1 gene was rapidly induced in CESS cells after 30 min of incubation with exogenous NGF, reached a maximum expression after 1 h, and returned to the prestimulation levels after 6 h. Pretreatment of cells with 3 μg/ml actinomycin D completely blocked the induction of MKP-1 mRNA in the presence of NGF (Fig. 3, panel B), thus indicating a transcriptional regulation, rather than mRNA stabilization mechanism. We next examined the time-dependent effect of NGF on MKP-1 protein levels. CESS cells were cultured in serum-free conditions in the presence or absence of 10 nm hrNGF for different times, lysed, and analyzed by Western blot analysis with specific antibodies. Fig. 3, panel C, shows that MKP-1 protein was constitutively expressed by CESS cells but NGF was able to increase expression up to 1.5-fold as early as 30 min after stimulation, reaching a peak (>3-fold increase) after 2 h. The increased levels of protein were stable up to 6 h after NGF stimulation. These data suggest that, in basal conditions, the production of endogenous NGF contributes to continuously sustain MKP-1 gene expression and protein synthesis. NGF Decreases Degradation of MKP-1 through Proteasome Pathway—The early detection and the sustained levels of NGF-induced MKP-1 protein suggests that, in addition to the transcriptional regulation of MKP-1 gene expression, NGF can stabilize MKP-1 protein by inhibiting its degradation. Recently, it has been demonstrated that MKP-1 is degraded via the proteasome pathway (36Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of NGF on MKP-1 degradation, we cultured CESS cells in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin with or without 10 nm hrNGF for different times (1–6 h). Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-ubiquitin antibodies or with rabbit anti-MKP-1 or rabbit IgG as control. Anti-ubiquitin-immunoprecipitated proteins were blotted and stained with anti-MKP-1 antibodies. Anti-MKP-1-immunoprecipitated proteins were blotted and stained with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Western blot analysis was also performed with the same anti-MKP-1 antibodies to detect the level of intact MKP-1. Fig. 4 shows that ubiquitinated MKP-1 molecules were increased in untreated cultures in comparison with NGF-stimulated cultures. These results indicate that, with its combined action on mRNA as well as protein levels, endogenous NGF contributes to maintain adequate amounts of active MKP-1 in CESS cells. Modulation of MKP-1 Protein Levels Changes the Phosphorylation Status of p38 MAPK—Because exogenous NGF increases MKP-1 synthesis and stability, we wanted to investigate whether NGF-neutralizing agents are able to modulate MKP-1 expression and whether the latter modulation is temporally related to the phosphorylation status of p38 MAPK. CESS cells were cultured in the presence of neutralizing antibodies to NGF for 12 h or with 100 nm K252 for 4 h, lysed, and blotted with anti-MKP-1 antibodies. Fig. 5, panel A, shows that incubation of cells with the above NGF-neutralizing agents inhibited the constitutive expression of MKP-1. In these experimental conditions, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK increased, whereas ERK phosphorylation decreased. Transfecting CESS cells with MKP-1-specific antisense oligonucleotides (37Duff J.L. Monia B.P. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7161-7166Google Scholar) yielded similar results. Fig. 5, panel B, shows that although p38 MAPK activation was increased under MKP-1 antisense oligonucleotides treatment, ERK activation was slightly down-modulated, suggesting that basal ERK activation escapes MKP-1 regulation and that another phosphatase (PP-2a) is possibly responsible for its dephosphorylation (38Jacob A. Molkentin J.D. Smolenski A. Lohmann S.M. Begum N. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C704-C713Google Scholar). However, these results clearly show that MKP-1 is involved in p38 MAPK deactivation in CESS cells and suggest its relevant role in NGF-dependent cell survival. MKP-1"

H. saimiri-induced transformation of T cells is becoming an important experimental tool of biomedical research. Two proteins of H. saimiri subgroup C, Tip and StpC, are essential for T cell transformation by this virus. It has been shown previously that StpC transforms fibroblasts, activates NF-κB, and binds to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, but the molecular mechanism of its action remains insufficiently understood. This study further characterized the effect of StpC on NF-κB. First, StpC activates NF-κB via the consensus pathway involving activation of I-κB kinase and subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of I-κB in both T lymphoid and epithelial cells. Second, triggering of this pathway by StpC in both T lymphoid and epithelial cells is dependent on the presence of functional NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). Third, StpC physically interacts with TRAF in epithelial cells, and the effect of StpC on NF-κB activity in these cells requires the presence of functional TRAF. Finally the effect of StpC is completely independent of TNF-α, a well described stimulus of NF-κB activity. Moreover it appears that StpC uncouples stimulation of NF-κB activity from TNF-α stimulation. Overall these results argue that the effect of StpC on NF-κB is similar to the effects of other viral proteins, “usurping” the TRAF/NIK/I-κB kinase pathway, and reinforce the notion that the role of StpC in cell transformation by H. saimiri may be mediated by signaling that results in NF-κB activation.

Virology. 2001; 279: 325-338Google Scholar). The role of StpC in H. saimiri-induced transformation is consistent with the oncogenic potential of StpC, which is evident by its ability to transform fibroblasts (41Jung J.U. Trimble J.J. King N.W. Biesinger B. Fleckenstein B.W. Desrosiers R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7051-7055Google Scholar). StpC has also been shown to facilitate activation of NF-κB (40Merlo J.J. Tsygankov A.Y. Virology. 2001; 279: 325-338Google Scholar, 42Lee H. Choi J.K. Li M. Kaye K. Kieff E. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3913-3919Google Scholar) and Ras (43Jung J.U. Desrosiers R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6506-6512Google Scholar). Furthermore the ability of StpC to transform fibroblasts (44Jung J.U. Desrosiers R.C. Virology. 1994; 204: 751-758Google Scholar) correlates with its ability to bind to NF-κB (42Lee H. Choi J.K. Li M. Kaye K. Kieff E. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3913-3919Google Scholar) and Ras (43Jung J.U. Desrosiers R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6506-6512Google Scholar). Also it has been shown that H. saimiri encoding a TRAF binding-deficient form of StpC is incapable of transforming human T lymphocytes (42Lee H. Choi J.K. Li M. Kaye K. Kieff E. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3913-3919Google Scholar). Therefore, the oncogenic potential of StpC and its role in T cell transformation is likely to be related to the ability of StpC to activate NF-κB and/or Ras. Finally the simultaneous and separate expression of Tip and/or StpC in T cells significantly affects replication of human immunodeficiency virus in these cells and their response to human immunodeficiency virus infection (18Henderson E.E. Tsygankov A.Y. Merlo J.J. Romano G. Guan M. Virology. 1999; 264: 125-133Google Scholar). These results raise a possibility that StpC may potentially be used in clinical applications. Consequently the molecular mechanisms mediating the effects of StpC on signal transduction are of great interest for insight into the biological functions of StpC and its potential applications. It has been shown previously that StpC activates NF-κB in fibroblasts and epithelial cells (42Lee H. Choi J.K. Li M. Kaye K. Kieff E. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3913-3919Google Scholar). Furthermore association of StpC with TRAF proteins upon their co-expression in COS and similar epithelial cells has been demonstrated (42Lee H. Choi J.K. Li M. Kaye K. Kieff E. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3913-3919Google Scholar). Likewise we have shown previously that StpC facilitates NF-κB transcriptional activity in MOLT4, a T lymphoblastoid cell line (40Merlo J.J. Tsygankov A.Y. Virology. 2001; 279: 325-338Google Scholar). Interestingly the effect of StpC on NF-κB in this system was enhanced by Tip, which itself was unable to substantially activate NF-κB (40Merlo J.J. Tsygankov A.Y. Virology. 2001; 279: 325-338Google Scholar). Although the positive effect of StpC on NF-κB activity is clearly the consensus of these reports, the molecular mechanisms mediating this effect remain insufficiently understood. The present study was focused on the detailed analysis of the effects of StpC on NF-κB activity. Our results indicate that StpC activates NF-κB in T and non-T cells by triggering the consensus TRAF/NIK/I-κB kinase (IKK) pathway leading to I-κB phosphorylation and degradation. These results argue that the effect of StpC on NF-κB is similar to those of Tax of human T cell lymphotrophic virus-I and LMP1 of Epstein-Barr virus (for reviews, see Refs. 45Li X.H. Gaynor R.B. AIDS Res. Hum. Retrovir. 2000; 16: 1583-1590Google Scholar, 46Hiscott J. Kwon H. Genin P. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 143-151Google Scholar, 47Yoshida M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 475-496Google Scholar) and reinforce the notion that the role of StpC in cell transformation by H. saimiri may be mediated by signaling that results in NF-κB activation. Cells—Human renal embryocarcinoma 293T cells were obtained from ATCC. Stable 293T-derived cell lines were generated by transducing them with a retroviral vector carrying StpC- and/or Tip-coding sequences along with the corresponding drug resistance genes; neomycin phosphotransferase, neo, was used as a selection marker with Tip, whereas puromycin N-acetyltransferase, pac, was used with StpC. Control vectors expressed neo or pac alone. This gene transfer system has been described previously (48Merlo J.J. Romano G. Gordon S.S. Feshchenko E.A. Peng G. Henderson E.E. Tsygankov A.Y. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 2389-2396Google Scholar). Cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 mm HEPES (Invitrogen). Puromycin (Sigma) and G418 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) were used for selection of stable lines. MOLT4 lymphoblastoid cells and stable StpC- and/or Tip-expressing lines derived from them were described previously (48Merlo J.J. Romano G. Gordon S.S. Feshchenko E.A. Peng G. Henderson E.E.

For transient expression of Tip and/or StpC, 95% confluent layers of 293T cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 3 μg of each expression plasmid plus the empty plasmid, if required, to the total amount of 6 μg using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE-2000 (Invitrogen)/well for 6 h according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were activated, where indicated, with 1 ng/ml TNF-α (Calbiochem) 24 h after transfection.

The full-length FLAG-tagged human TRAF2 and Myc-tagged NIK expression plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. D. Goeddel (Tularik Inc., South San Francisco, CA). TRAF2 deletion mutants were constructed using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase as described previously (50Wang J. Wilkinson M.F. BioTechniques. 2001; 31: 722-724Google Scholar). The primer pairs were 5′-AGGGAGGTGGAGAGCCTGCCGGCCGTCTGTCCCAG-3′ and 5′-CATGGATCCCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCA-3′ for making TRAF2-(98–501) and 5′-TCGGTGCTGGAGGCAAAGCCCCTCTTGGGAGACCA-3′ and 5′-CACCTCCCTGCGGGCAGCATTATCTGGGAAGGCCG-3′ for making TRAF2-(Δ101–249). To generate inactivated NIKK429A/K430A, Myc-tagged NIK cDNA was recloned into pAlterMAX (Promega, Madison, WI), and the resulting plasmid was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's recommendations using 5′-TACTTCCAGCCGCACTGCAGCGACAGCGCACTGGAA-3′ as a mutagenic oligonucleotide. Reporter Assays—The NF-κB and AP-1 reporter constructs containing firefly luciferase cDNA and the pRL-null normalization construct containing Renilla reniformis luciferase cDNA have been described previously (40Merlo J.J. Tsygankov A.Y. Virology. 2001; 279: 325-338Google Scholar). To measure reporter activity, 293T cells (95% confluent in a 6-well plate) were transfected with 3 μg of the NF-κB or AP-1 reporter and 0.4 μg of pRL-null using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE-2000 (Invitrogen)/well for 6 h. The transfected cells were activated or left untreated. The measurement of luciferase activity was carried out using the dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega) 24 h after adding DNA. Transcription Factor Binding to DNA—The NF-κB and AP-1 DNA binding activity assays were performed using Trans-AM ELISA-based kits from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly cell extracts were incubated in a 96-well plate coated with an oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB or AP-1 consensus binding site. Activated transcription factors from extracts specifically bound to the respective immobilized oligonucleotide were detected using the antibodies to NF-κB p65 and p50 (in NF-κB assays) or those to c-Fos and c-Jun (in AP-1 assays) followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in an ELISA-like assay. Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Immune Complex Kinase Assays—Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were performed essentially as described previously (49Feshchenko E.A. Langdon W.Y. Tsygankov A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8323-8331Google Scholar). Briefly cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 in Tris/NaCl/EDTA buffer with NaF, aprotinin, leupeptin, and sodium vanadate (Sigma). Equal amounts of total protein were treated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with the appropriate antibodies. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Tip and StpC were described previously (48Merlo J.J. Romano G. Gordon S.S. Feshchenko E.A. Peng G. Henderson E.E. Tsygankov A.Y. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 2389-2396Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to I-κBα (C-21), I-κBβ (C-20), NF-κB p65 (H-286), and IKKα (M-280) and mouse monoclonal antibody to phospho-I-κBα (B-9) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG was purchased from Sigma. To verify equal loading, immunoblotting with rabbit anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Research Diagnostic Inc., Flanders, NJ) or mouse monoclonal anti-actin (C-2) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was carried out. Protein bands were then visualized by chemiluminescence using an ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). When immunoprecipitation preceded immunoblotting, equal amounts of total protein were mixed with the appropriate antibody followed by Pansorbin (heat- and formalin-treated Staphylococcus aureus cells from Calbiochem), which was added to bind the immune complexes formed in solution. The pellet was extensively washed with lysis buffer, and the components of the precipitated immune complexes were extracted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For IKK kinase assays, cells were lysed in the buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. IKKα was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with mouse monoclonal anti-IKKα (B-8) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1 μg of the antibody/1 mg of total protein), and the obtained immune complexes were extensively washed in lysis buffer and then treated with a total of 30 μl of kinase mixture containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 μg GST-I-κBα-(1–54) and 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (7000Ci/mmol, ICN, Irvine, CA). The samples were incubated on a shaker at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the kinase mixtures were separated using SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried, and the phosphoprotein bands were visualized using autoradiography. Subcellular Fractionation—Nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation of 293T cells was performed using an NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly 293T cells were scraped off the 100-mm plate, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by centrifugation. NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents were used to lyse harvested cells stepwise to generate functional cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of MOLT4 cells were obtained using hypotonic lysis of cells followed by high salt extraction of nuclei as described previously (40Merlo J.J. Tsygankov A.Y. Virology. 2001; 279: 325-338Google Scholar). Protein Labeling—293T cells were washed twice in cysteine- and methionine-deficient DMEM and incubated in cysteine- and methionine-deficient DMEM supplemented with 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 30 min at 37 °C. Then cells were incubated with 35S-Trans-label reagent (1000 Ci/mmol, ICN) at a concentration of 200 μCi/ml for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and complete DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the cells. TNF-α was added to the cell culture when needed. Following treatments, cells were washed and lysed. The protein of interest was immunoprecipitated as described previously (49Feshchenko E.A. Langdon W.Y. Tsygankov A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8323-8331Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the fluorography with sodium salicylate was performed. We previously demonstrated that expression of StpC substantially facilitated NF-κB activity in MOLT4 T lymphoblastoid cells and that this effect was enhanced by Tip expression. Furthermore co-expression of StpC and Tip caused a dramatic increase in interleukin-2 production by MOLT4 cells (40Merlo J.J. Tsygankov A.Y. Virology. 2001; 279: 325-338Google Scholar). To elucidate signaling pathways causing these effects and to evaluate their cell type specificity, we assessed the influence of StpC and Tip on NF-κB activation in both MOLT4 lymphoblastoid and 293T epithelial cells. As expected, StpC increased the basal NF-κB activity in MOLT4 cells; Tip showed no effect on NF-κB activity, while expressed alone, but somewhat enhanced the effect of StpC (Fig. 1A). Likewise StpC activated NF-κB activity in 293T cells, and Tip enhanced the effect of StpC, exerting no effect on its own (Fig. 1B). No significant clone-to-clone variability was found within the groups of like clones in the experiments shown in Fig. 1B. Furthermore the results obtained using stable 293T cell clones were consistent with those obtained with 293T cells transiently transfected to express Tip and/or StpC (data not shown). Together these results rule out the possibility that our findings are biased by the atypical responses of some individual clones. We next examined whether Tip and/or StpC modifies the effect of TNF-α, a consensus NF-κB-activating stimulus. TNF-α was shown to activate NF-κB in both MOLT4 and 293T cells if they were Tip–StpC– or Tip+StpC–. In contrast, Tip–StpC+ and Tip+StpC+ cells, both MOLT4 and 293T, exhibited a dramatic increase in the basal NF-κB activity but were unresponsive to TNF-α (Fig. 1, A and B). Extending incubation times with TNF-α did not abolish this difference between Tip–StpC– and Tip+StpC– cells on the one hand and Tip–StpC+ and Tip+StpC+ cells on the other hand (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicated that StpC greatly increases the basal activity of NF-κB while uncoupling it from TNF-α stimulation. To elucidate the mechanism of StpC-induced activation of NF-κB, we first examined whether the activation of NF-κB by StpC is linked to an increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity in 293T cells. Therefore, we analyzed binding of NF-κB p65 to the corresponding DNA sequence using an ELISA-based technique. These experiments showed that StpC expression substantially increased this binding in the absence of any stimulation (Fig. 2A). In contrast, Tip had no effect on basal NF-κB/DNA binding, although the analysis of multiple clones indicated that simultaneous expression of Tip and StpC enhanced this binding to some extent as compared with that in the presence of StpC alone (data not shown). Similar experiments carried out with NF-κB p50 indicated that the effects of Tip and StpC on NF-κB p65 and p50 subunits were essentially identical (data not shown). Overall these results were in agreement with those obtained using NF-κB-specific reporters and described above. Likewise the effects of StpC and Tip on the response of the DNA binding activity of NF-κB to TNF-α were similar to those on the activity of NF-κB reporters; TNF-α elevated DNA binding activity of NF-κB p65 and p50 in 293T cells expressing resistance markers or Tip alone but did so only modestly in StpC+Tip– or StpC+Tip+ cells (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Specificity of NF-κB/DNA interactions was verified using a soluble NF-κB-binding oligonucleotide, which is capable of disrupting the interactions between NF-κB and a microtiter plate-immobilized NF-κB-binding oligonucleotide, and a mutant form of this oligonucleotide, which cannot interfere with NF-κB/DNA interactions. These experiments showed that both basal and TNF-α-induced DNA binding activity of NF-κB was specific (Fig. 2A). The results obtained with 293T cells were consistent with those obtained previously in MOLT4 cells using electrophoretic mobility shift assays; StpC significantly up-regulated the basal DNA binding activity of NF-κB in MOLT4 cells as well (40Merlo J.J. Tsygankov A.Y. Virology. 2001; 279: 325-338Google Scholar). To further analyze the effect of StpC on NF-κB activity, we measured the levels of NF-κB p65 protein in the cytosol and the nucleus since the translocation of p65 to the nucleus is a crucial step of NF-κB activation. These experiments indicated that a substantial fraction of NF-κB p65 is constitutively localized to the nucleus in StpC+Tip– or StpC+ Tip+ cells in contrast to the situation in vector control and StpC–Tip+ cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore the simultaneous expression of Tip and StpC in these experiments resulted in a higher level of the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 than did the expression of StpC alone. Similar findings were made in MOLT4 cells (data not shown). These results were in good agreement with those obtained using reporter constructs and DNA binding. NF-κB translocation to the nucleus and an increase in its DNA binding activity is typically preceded by I-κB degradation. Therefore, we next examined the effects of StpC and Tip on I-κBα degradation in 293T and MOLT4 cells. These experiments indicated no consistent decrease in the basal level of I-κBα in non-stimulated StpC-positive cells, either 293T (Fig. 3A) or MOLT4 (data not shown), in which constitutive activation of NF-κB was easily detectable (Figs. 1 and 2). Furthermore a decrease in the level of I-κBα was not enhanced by TNF-α in StpC-positive cells, either 293T or MOLT4. Moreover the presence of StpC alone or in combination with Tip severely reduced the ability of TNF-α to induce a drop in the level of I-κBα in both 293T and MOLT4 cells, which remained normal in vector cells and those expressing Tip alone (data not shown). Hence StpC caused no decrease in the basal level of I-κB but effectively uncoupled NF-κB activation from TNF-α stimulation in a cell type-independent fashion. These results raised a question of the involvement of I-κBα degradation in the effect of StpC on NF-κB activity. To clarify this issue, we first examined the effect of MG132, a potent proteasome inhibitor capable of blocking NF-κB activation by abrogating degradation of phosphorylated I-κB (51Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Google Scholar, 52Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Google Scholar), on the ability of StpC to increase the activity of NF-κB. MG132 exerted a profound inhibitory effect on NF-κB ac"

The enzyme is of fundamental biochemical interest, because it catalyzes removal of a non-acidic hydrogen atom in the dehydration reaction. It is also a potential target for development of herbicides. IGPD is a metalloenzyme in which transition metals induce aggregation and are required for catalysis. Addition of 1 equivalent of Mn2+/subunit is shown by analytical ultracentrifugation to induce the formation of 24-mers from trimeric IGPD.

Histidine is an essential dietary nutrient for animals but is synthesized de novo by plants and microorganisms. Thus, the biosynthetic pathway is a potential target for herbicide development. Histidine biosynthesis from the precursor phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate is a complex process involving nine enzyme-catalyzed steps. Many intermediates in the pathway are unstable, which has slowed the structural and mechanistic study of individual steps.

The IGPD-catalyzed reaction may have an unusual molecular mechanism because the leaving C-2 hydrogen of IGP is not acidic.

Aggregation has confounded attempts to obtain a three-dimensional structure for IGPD. Preliminary studies (16Wilkinson K.W. Baker P.J. Rice D.W. Rodgers H.F. Stillman T.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1995; 51: 845-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) suggested that yeast IGPD crystallized as a 24-mer with molecular octahedral (432) symmetry consistent with its aggregation in solution. However, the cubic crystals diffracted too poorly for structure determination. The his3 gene of the fungus Filobasidiella neoformans (formerly named Cryptococcus neoformans) encodes the 202-residue IGPD polypeptide (7Parker A.R. Moore T.D. Edman J.C. Schwab J.M. Davisson V.J. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The sequences of IGPD from F. neoformans and other sources have no detectable relationship with any protein of known structure. Hence, the fold and structural organization of IGPD cannot be inferred by homology. Amino acids essential to catalysis have not been identified, but several conserved histidine, glutamate, and aspartate residues may serve as metal ligands or play roles in catalysis. In particular, two repeats of the motif Asx-Xaa-His-His-Xaa-Xaa-Glu ((D/N)XHHXXE) are potential metal binding sites (7Parker A.R. Moore T.D. Edman J.C. Schwab J.M. Davisson V.J. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) especially as histidine imidazoles have been implicated in metal binding (17Petersen J. Hawkes T.R. Lowe D.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 80: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two occurrences of this motif (residues 69-75 and 165-171 in F. neoformans IGPD) are suggestive of an ancient gene duplication event. IGPD is an interesting candidate for structural studies because of the unusual chemical reaction and aggregation properties, the metal dependence of these properties, the lack of sequence similarity to proteins of known structure, and the potential as a herbicide target. We present here the 2.3-Å crystal structure of F. neoformans IGPD. The structure reveals a new fold in which an unusual structural motif is duplicated into a single compact domain. The structure also provides clues about the location of the active site, allows modeling of the active 24-mer, is a basis for elucidating the mechanism of dehydration, and aids the development of more potent and specific herbicides. Purification and Demetallation of F. neoformans IGPD—F. neoformans IGPD was expressed using the his3 expression vector pHIS3-T7 in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (7Parker A.R. Moore T.D.

One-liter cultures were grown at 37 °C in 2× YT medium, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol to an A550 of 1.0 and for 8 h after induction with 1.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4200 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 40 ml of 20 mm EPPS, pH 8.1 (Buffer A), and disrupted by sonication. DNA was removed with 1% (w/v) in streptomycin sulfate. IGPD was purified in three steps by anion exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose column in Buffer A with a 0-1 m NaCl gradient), precipitation in 25% saturated (NH4)2SO4, and size-exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S-400 column in Buffer A). Enzymatic activity was assayed by monitoring absorbance of the enol form of imidazole acetol phosphate (3Hawkes T.R. Thomas P.G. Edwards L.S. Rayner S.J. Wilkinson K.W. Rice D.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The yield from 1 liter of E. coli culture was 95 mg of purified IGPD with a specific activity of 5.8 μmol/min/μg of IGPD at 30 °C. Purified IGPD was concentrated to 2.8 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C. F. neoformans IGPD was demetallated by a 6-h incubation at 55 °C in Buffer A containing 4 m urea, 400 μm EDTA, 400 μm EGTA, dialyzed for 1 h at room temperature and 14 h at 4 °C against Buffer A containing 3 g/liter Chelex 100, and then concentrated to ∼14 mg/ml (0.5 mm) by vacuum dialysis. IGPD was reconstituted by the addition of MnCl2 to a final concentration of 1 mm then the IGPD was stored at 4 °C and used for crystallization experiments within 48 h. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Demetallated IGPD was dialyzed against 0.2 m KCl, 50 mm ethanolamine, pH 7.5, which had been pretreated with Chelex 100. For sedimentation velocity experiments, a standard two-sector carbon-filled Epon centerpiece with quartz windows was treated with 0.1 m EDTA, pH 7.5, for 24 h prior to use, washed with Chelex-treated water to remove EDTA, filled with 150 μl of 1 mg/ml metal-free IGPD, and incubated in a Beckman analytical ultracentrifuge (model XLA) for 1 h at 20 °C. Absorbance scans of metal-free IGPD were collected at 5-min intervals during sedimentation at 42,000 rpm. The centrifuge was stopped, 1 equivalent of Mn2+/IGPD monomer was added to the cell, the solution was carefully mixed, and the cell was incubated in the centrifuge for 1 h. Absorbance scans of Mn2+-containing IGPD were collected at 5-min intervals during sedimentation at 22,000 rpm. The resulting scans were analyzed using the continuous distribution (c(s)) analysis module in the program Sedfit v8.7 (analyticalultracentrifugation.com). Partial specific volumes and solvent densities were calculated using the program SEDNTERP v1.07, which was obtained from the RASMB program depository (rasmb.bbri.org/rasmb/spin/ms_dos/sednterp-philo/). Crystallization and Data Collection—IGPD was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion from a 1:1 mixture of protein solution (14 mg/ml IGPD, 1 mm MnCl2, 20 mm HEPPS, pH 8.1) and reservoir solution (0.9 m (NH4)2SO4, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0). Crystals of cubic morphology grew to an average dimension of 0.2 mm in approximately 1 week. A mercury-derivative crystal was prepared by a 1.25-h soak in reservoir solution containing 1.0 mm ethyl mercury phosphate, followed by 0.5-h back soak in reservoir solution. IGPD was also crystallized with 1-2 mm concentration of two triazole phosphonic acid derivatives, 2-hydroxy-3-(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)propylphosphonate (HTPP) (2Hawkes T.R. Cox J.M. Barnes N.J.

Crystals were cryoprotected by successive transfers through reservoir solution with increasing glycerol to a final concentration of 25% (v/v) and flash-frozen in a nitrogen cold stream at 100 K. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data at the mercury LIII edge were recorded at BM-14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility using a Mar 345 imaging plate detector. At each wavelength, data were recorded in two 30° sweeps related by inverse geometry. The same regions of reciprocal space were recorded in “high resolution” and “low resolution” passes. Data from native crystals and from IGPD crystals grown with either HTPP or IRL-1803 were recorded on an R-axis IIc imaging plate using CuKα radiation. Data were processed using the HKL package (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325Crossref Scopus (38436) Google Scholar). IGPD crystallized in the cubic space group P213 with unit cell parameter 105.3 Å, which is consistent with two polypeptides/ asymmetric unit (Vm = 2.2 Å3/Da, ∼42% solvent).

Open table in a new tab Multiwavelength Anomalous Diffraction Structure Determination and Refinement—Structure determination was complicated by translational non-crystallographic symmetry along the body diagonal of the cubic unit cell, revealed by a peak in the native Patterson map (∼10% of the origin peak) at u = v = w = 0.47. Two mercury sites were located by inspection of a Patterson map calculated with coefficients|FA|, which were derived from the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data using the program SOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). Four additional mercury sites were found using automated procedures in SOLVE. The final figure of merit was 0.38 for six mercury sites (Table I). Ten cycles of phase refinement via 2-fold averaging, solvent flattening, and histogram matching in the program DM (20Cowtan K.D. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) yielded an interpretable 2.37-Å map from|Fobs|, ϕbest. The model was built into a 2.37-Å electron density map using the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). All refinement was done with maximum likelihood amplitude and phase probability targets using CNS (22Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16946) Google Scholar) and the data at λ3 (Table II). Atomic occupancies of protein residues in dual positions were refined once. The final refined model consists of two IGPD monomers, A and B, related by an approximate 2-fold axis (179.5° rotation) parallel to the cubic unit cell axis. Monomers A and B reside in different IGPD trimers and give rise to the native Patterson peak. In each monomer, one short internal peptide and 14-15 C-terminal residues are disordered and missing from the model. Met-1 was not present in the crystallized protein (data not shown). Three out of four cysteine side chains were modified with mercury. No potential Mn2+ sites were identified in electron density maps. Arg-97 and Asp-106 in each monomer lie in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot; however, their backbone conformations are well supported by electron density. The conformation of Arg-97 (ϕ = +70, ψ = -53) is stabilized by backbone hydrogen bonds of both the NH and C=O groups, by a bidentate salt bridge to Glu-115 and by stacking with the Tyr-98 side chain. The conformation of Asp-106 (ϕ = +47, ψ = -116) is stabilized by its position in a type II β-turn (residues 105-108) and by a hydrogen bond of the backbone C=O and side chain of His-157 in an adjacent monomer. Arg-97, Asp-106, Glu-115, and His-157 are invariant among IGPD sequences, suggesting that these residues as well as their conformations may be important for IGPD function.

Open table in a new tab Crystals of the free enzyme and those grown in presence of inhibitors HTPP or IRL-1803 were isomorphous with mercury-IGPD crystals. For each of these structures, the starting model for refinement was based on the mercury-IGPD structure. The three structures are virtually identical. The most reliable model was obtained from crystals grown without inhibitor (Table II). No density was observed for Mn2+, HTPP, or IRL-1803 in these structures. The absence of bound Mn2+ was confirmed by the examination of anomalous difference Fourier maps. The discussion is limited to the higher resolution mercury-IGPD structure because there are no significant differences between the mercury-IGPD and free-enzyme structures (root mean square deviation is 0.38 Å for 180 Cα atoms). Modeling of an IGPD 24-Mer—Models of IGPD 24-mers with octahedral symmetry were constructed from the crystallographic trimers. Using the trimer as a rigid body, a two-dimensional search was done through 120° rotation in 10° steps around the trimer 3-fold axis and through 140-Å translation in 5-Å steps along the trimer 3-fold. This search covers all of the rotation space, and a translation in which the ends of the range have no intertrimer contacts. At each grid position, a 24-mer was constructed from the trimer by application of 4- and 2-fold symmetry. Solutions were scored by tabulating the number of “bad” (d < 2.5 Å) and “good”(2.5 Å < d < 3.6 Å) interatomic contacts between trimers and the ratio of good to bad contacts. Full atomic coordinates were used for the search, which was done with trimers constructed from both the crystallographic A and B monomers. Most of the search space yielded impossible solutions with interpenetrating trimers. Fine searches (1° rotation step, 1-Å translation step) were done around six solutions with good:bad ratios of 3.5-16. Solutions were evaluated by visual inspection. Structure Determination—F. neoformans IGPD produced in E. coli had a heterogeneous metal content and yielded poorly diffracting crystals. To improve crystal quality and to label the protein with a single anomalous scatterer, IGPD was demetallated to produce the catalytically inactive 70-kDa species and then reconstituted with each of several metals. Many of the reconstituted proteins crystallized, but only crystals of IGPD reconstituted with Mn2+ were suitable for high resolution analysis. As Mn2+ does not have an x-ray absorption edge convenient for multiwavelength anomalous diffraction, crystals were treated with mercury, and the structure was determined by mercury multiwavelength anomalous diffraction. The crystallographic model agrees well with the diffraction data and with stereochemical criteria (Table II). The estimated coordinate error is 0.29 Å (23Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). The final 2.3-Å model includes one monomer in each of two trimers. Monomers A and B are nearly identical, except for two loops comprising 12 residues (11Chiariotti L. Nappo A.G. Carlomagno M.S. Bruni C.B. Mol. Gen.

The remaining 167 Cα atoms superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.4 Å. Likewise, the trimers of monomers A and B are nearly identical with a root mean square deviation of 0.4 Å for 501 Cα atoms. IGPD Fold: Gene Duplication and Unique Arrangement of a Rare Structural Motif—The IGPD polypeptide forms a single domain (Fig. 1) consisting of a bundle of four α-helices (α1-α4), sandwiched between four-stranded, mixed β-sheets (β1-β2-β4-β3 and β5-β6-β8-β7). The fold possesses an internal repeat, in which the first β-sheet and two α-helices (β1-β2-β3-α1-β4-α2, residues 2-93) have an identical topology to the second β-sheet and two α-helices (β5-β6-β7-α3-β8-α4, residues 94-187). The half-domain motif includes a rare left-handed βαβ crossover (β3-α1-β4 and β7-α3-β8). The half-domains are related by pseudo-dyad symmetry (157° rotation) such that 77 pairs of Cα atoms superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 2.1 Å (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Internal repeat in IGPD. A, stereo view of the superposition of Cα traces of the N and C-terminal halves of the IGPD monomer. The N-terminal half is traced in yellow, and the C-terminal half is in gray. All atoms are shown for conserved side chains in the C-terminal (D/N)XHHXXE motif, colored by atomic type (gray, carbon; red, oxygen; blue, nitrogen). Residues at the N- and C terminus of each half-fold are indicated. This and other superpositions were done using the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). B, structure-based sequence alignment of the two halves of IGPD. Evidence for gene duplication and fusion is found in conservation in a multiple-sequence alignment (39Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

Secondary structure elements corresponding to the F. neoformans IGPD structure are indicated above and below the sequence alignment. α-Helices are represented by cylinders, β-strands by arrows, loops by black solid lines, and disordered regions by dashed lines. The degree of conservation is indicated by the background color, with invariant residues in red (white characters), 95% invariant in pink, and sites of conservative substitution in yellow. The (D/N)XHHXXE motif is outlined. This figure was made using ALSCRIPT (40Barton G.J.

The sequences of residues 1-93 and 94-202 of F. neoformans IGPD are 19% identical (Fig. 2). The most conserved feature of the internal repeat is the (D/N)XHHXXE motif in loops β3-α1 (residues 69-75) and β8-α4 (residues 165-171). The repetition of sequence and structural elements suggests a gene duplication in the evolution of IGPD. Gene duplication is a recurring theme in enzymes of histidine biosynthesis. The enzymes that catalyze the two steps preceding the dehydration reaction of IGPD, phosphoribosylformimino-5-aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide isomerase and imidazole glycerol-phosphate synthase, also have internal repeats and are thought to have evolved by similar gene duplication and fusion events (24Lang D. Thoma R. Henn-Sax M. Sterner R. Wilmanns M. Science. 2000; 289: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These enzymes are homologs but are unrelated to IGPD. The structure data base contains no proteins with folds like the IGPD fold, based on a topology search (25Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2022323043,"Down-regulation of several key actin-binding proteins, such as α-actinin, vinculin, gelsolin, and tropomyosins (TMs), is considered to contribute to the disorganized cytoskeleton present in many neoplastic cells. TMs stabilize actin filaments against the gel severing actions of proteins such as cofilin. Among multiple TMs expressed in non-muscle cells, tropomyosin-1 (TM1) isoform induces stress fibers and functions as a suppressor of malignant transformation. However, the molecular mechanisms of TM1-mediated cytoskeletal effects and tumor suppression remain poorly understood. We have hypothesized that the ability of TM1 to stabilize microfilaments is crucial for tumor suppression. In this study, by employing a variant TM1, which contains an N-terminal hemagglutinin epitope tag, we demonstrate that the N terminus is a key determinant of tropomyosin-1 function. Unlike the wild type TM1, the modified protein fails to restore stress fibers and inhibit anchorage-independent growth in transformed cells. Furthermore, the N-terminal modification of TM1 disorganizes the cytoskeleton and delays cytokinesis in normal cells, abolishes binding to F-actin, and disrupts the dimeric associations in vivo. The functionally defective TM1 allows the association of cofilin to stress fibers and disorganizes the microfilaments, whereas wild type TM1 appears to restrict the binding of cofilin to stress fibers. TM1-induced cytoskeletal reorganization appears to be mediated through preventing cofilin interaction with microfilaments. Our studies provide in vivo functional evidence that the N terminus is a critical determinant of TM1 functions, which in turn determines the organization of stress fibers.

Our studies provide in vivo functional evidence that the N terminus is a critical determinant of TM1 functions, which in turn determines the organization of stress fibers. One of the most common and yet prominent features of neoplastic cells is the presence of disorganized actin microfilaments (1Lin J.J. Warren K.S. Wamboldt D.D. Wang T. Lin J.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 1-38Google Scholar, 2Pawlak G. Helfman D.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 41-47Google Scholar). A functionally defective cytoskeleton, arising from the disorganized microfilament architecture, has been shown to be responsible for the loss of normal cellular morphology and cell polarity; altered intracellular transport, cell motility, and cell adhesion; and defective cytokinesis. Suppression of several key actin-binding proteins, including tropomyosins (TMs), 1The abbreviations used are: TMs, tropomyosins; DT, doubly transformed; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid. occurs in many neoplastic cells, and this contributes to the assembly of disorganized cytoskeleton (reviewed in Refs. 3Button E.

Down-regulation of TMs in malignantly transformed cells has been known for about 2 decades and is widely reported (5Hendricks M. Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5633-5637Google Scholar, 6Matsumura F. Lin J.J. Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Thomas G.P. Topp W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13954-13964Google Scholar, 7Cooper H.L. Feuerstein N. Noda M. Bassin R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 972-983Google Scholar), and yet the role of TMs in neoplastic transformation of cells remains incompletely understood. TMs are a family of actin-binding proteins that stabilize microfilaments from the gel severing actions of proteins such as gelsolin and cofilin (1Lin J.J. Warren K.S. Wamboldt D.D. Wang T. Lin J.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 1-38Google Scholar, 8Pittenger M.F. Kazzaz J.A. Helfman D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 96-104Google Scholar). Multiple TMs are generated by alternative splicing with a high degree of tissue specificity. For example, fibroblasts express five different, closely related TMs that may be categorized into high and low Mr species containing 284 and 248 amino acids, respectively. TMs are key regulatory proteins of actin cytoskeleton in that they regulate almost all aspects of actin polymerization (9Wen K.K. Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40594-40600Google Scholar, 10Strand J. Nili M. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34832-34839Google Scholar, 11Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E.

Biol. 2002; 12: R523-R525Google Scholar). Although the function of TMs is better elucidated in skeletal and cardiac muscles, given their diverse and tissue-specific expression patterns, the importance of the existence of multiple TMs in nonmuscle cell physiology is poorly understood (8Pittenger M.F. Kazzaz J.A. Helfman D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 96-104Google Scholar). It has been suggested that TM isoforms perform distinct functions rather than being simply redundant (1Lin J.J. Warren K.S. Wamboldt D.D. Wang T. Lin J.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 1-38Google Scholar, 8Pittenger M.F. Kazzaz J.A. Helfman D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 96-104Google Scholar). Work from this and several other laboratories shows that the high Mr TMs are consistently down-regulated in many malignantly transformed cells (5Hendricks M. Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Res. 2002; 279: 40-51Google Scholar). This suggests a role for TMs in the maintenance of normal growth and cytoskeletal organization, and that expression of TM1 may be incompatible with neoplastic growth. In support of this hypothesis, we have recently shown that TM isoform-1 (TM1) expression is widely and profoundly down-regulated in primary breast tumors (17Raval G.N. Bharadwaj S. Levine E.A. Willingham M.C. Geary R.L. Kute T. Prasad G.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6194-6203Google Scholar). Furthermore, TM1 restores the microfilament organization in transformed cells, and suppresses malignant growth (16Mahadev K. Raval G. Bharadwaj S. Willingham M.C. Lange E.M. Vonderhaar B.K.V.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 537-545Google Scholar). Although these studies suggested TM1 is a class II tumor suppressor (17Raval G.N. Bharadwaj S. Levine E.A. Willingham M.C. Geary R.L. Kute T. Prasad G.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6194-6203Google Scholar, 20Prasad G.L. Masuelli L. Raj M.H. Harindranath N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2027-2031Google Scholar, 21Sers C. Emmenegger U. Husmann K. Bucher K. Andres A.C. Schafer R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 935-944Google Scholar), the molecular basis of cytoskeletal organization and tumor suppression by TM1 remains unknown. TM1 lacks distinct catalytic activity or binding partners that readily explain the isoform-specific anti-oncogenic effects. Structurally, all TMs are predominantly α-helical proteins in which hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids occupy defined positions in a repeating heptapeptide (22Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 5-49Google Scholar). TM1, like other TMs, is a cytosolic structural protein that binds to actin stoichiometrically in micromolar range. For example, both TM1 and TM2 bind to actin at 1:7 ratio, although some differences in binding properties exist (23Pittenger M.F. Kistler A. Helfman D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3253-3265Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is intriguing that the biological effects of TM1 expression in tumor cells are remarkably different from those of other TM isoforms. We have considered that reorganization of microfilaments is a critical component of tumor suppression by TM1. The studies presented here demonstrate that the N terminus of TM1 is essential for TM1 functions and imply that TM1 is a key modulator of stress fibers. Cell Culture and Antibodies—Culture conditions and media for NIH3T3, NIH3T3/TM1, and DT/TM1 cells have been described previously 2(4Janmey P.A. Chaponnier C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 111-117Google Scholar). Doubly transformed (DT) cells are NIH3T3 cells transformed with two copies of the v-ki-ras oncogene (7Cooper H.L. Feuerstein N. Noda M. Bassin R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 972-983Google Scholar). An epitope-tagged TM1 was constructed by cloning TM1 in-frame in pCGN vector to add hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the N terminus. The variant TM1 thus produced would have an N-terminal extension, ASSYPYDVPDYASLGGPSR, but contains identical wild type TM1 sequence from the “R” onward. DT cells were cotransfected with the recombinant plasmid and pCMVneo to generate single cell-derived clones by standard transfection methods. N-[1-(2,3-Dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate salts (Roche Applied Science) or LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) were used for transfections. In experiments involving transient transfections, cells were routinely processed 48 h after transfection, unless otherwise indicated. A TM polyclonal antibody, generated in this laboratory, that detects multiple TMs was described previously (16Mahadev K. Raval G. Bharadwaj S. Willingham M.C. Lange E.M. Vonderhaar B.K.V. Salomon D. Prasad G.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 279: 40-51Google Scholar). TM311 mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes a common epitope found in all high Mr TMs (25Nicholson-Flynn K. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Levitt P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6853-6863Google Scholar) was obtained from Sigma. HA (12CA5) mouse monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) and antibodies against α-tubulin (Sigma), phosphocofilin (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), actin, and cofilin (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO) were purchased. Monolayer Growth and Morphology—Ten thousand cells were plated and counted, and cell numbers were plotted against time of culture. Morphology of subconfluent monolayer cultures was recorded by fixing and staining with a HEMA 3 kit obtained from Fisher. The samples were photographed at ×40 magnification. Soft Agar Assays—Anchorage-independent experiments were performed in soft agar as described previously. One thousand cells were mixed in 0.36% agar, plated on a 0.8% agar base, and cultured for 10–14 days (18Prasad G.L. Fuldner R.A. Cooper H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7039-7043Google Scholar). Cells were stained overnight with 0.05% nitro blue tetrazolium in PBS, and colonies were counted. Immunofluorescence—Cells were cultured in chamber slides (Nunc), fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min (26Shah V. Bharadwaj S. Kaibuchi K. Prasad G.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2112-2121Google Scholar). The samples were incubated with an appropriate primary antibody, followed by a second antibody conjugated to a fluorochrome, and finally with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin. Slides were finally rinsed in water and mounted using Antifade kit (Molecular Probes). Images were recorded using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope and imported into Adobe Photoshop. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitations—Cells were lysed in a buffer containing Nonidet P-40, sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors and clarified at 14,000 × g (26Shah V. Bharadwaj S. Kaibuchi K. Prasad G.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2112-2121Google Scholar). Supernatants containing 50–100 μg of proteins were separated on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted. For immunoprecipitations, 200 μg of protein lysate, precleared with protein G for 1 h, was incubated with the primary antibody (27Gimona M. Watakabe A. Helfman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9776-9780Google Scholar). The immune complexes were washed with immunoprecipitation buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. To quantify the protein expression, the exposed membranes were scanned, and the band intensities were calculated using the magic wand tool of the Adobe Photoshop (version 6.0). Metabolic Labeling of Cells—Subconfluent cultures were pre-incubated with labeling medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum) for 3 h. Metabolic labeling was carried out in the labeling medium containing [35S]methionine (50 μCi/ml) for 6 h (24Prasad G.L. Fuldner R.A. Braverman R. McDuffie E. Cooper H.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 1-10Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PBS and extracted in Nonidet P-40/deoxycholate lysis buffer. For immunoprecipitations and cross-linking experiments, lysates equivalent to 4 × 106 cpm were used. F-actin Quantitation in Cells—F-actin content in cells was measured using a protocol described by Zigmond and co-workers (28Tardif M. Huang S. Redmond T. Safer D. Pring M. Zigmond S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28075-28083Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells (1.5 × 105) were plated 12–24 h prior to experimentation. Monolayer cultures were washed with PBS, fixed, and stained in PBS containing 3.7% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.2 μm TRITC phalloidin for 3 h at room temperature with constant rocking in the dark. Unincorporated TRITC phalloidin was removed by four PBS washes. Cell monolayer was extracted by using 1 ml of methanol, and the cell suspension was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and incubated for 48 h with constant rocking at 4 °C. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and fluorescence (540ex/575em) was read in an Aminco Bowman luminescence fluorimeter using the methanol solvent as blank. To determine background fluorescence, 2 μm of unlabeled phalloidin was added along with TRITC-phalloidin. To determine total actin content, cell lysates were probed with anti-actin antibody in immunoblots and expressed as a ratio with endogenous tubulin. Cell Cycle Analysis—To estimate the fraction of cells in each phase of cell cycle, asynchronously growing subconfluent cultures were trypsinized and stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS containing 0.06% Nonidet P-40 and 30 μg/ml RNase A. Cell cycle analyses were carried out using a BD FACS Star Plus flow cytometer. Flow cytometry of serum-starved (24 h) or stimulated cells was performed. For serum stimulation, serum-starved cells were cultured in regular medium for 28 h. HA-TM1 Purification—HA-TM1 was subcloned in pET3a (Novagen) and expressed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS bacteria. Cultures were grown to A600 0.4–0.6 and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended for sonication in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mg/liter DNase, 1 mg/liter RNase A, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm PMSF, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mg of potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (Calbiochem) and immediately subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation to achieve ∼50% saturation. The protein pellet was resuspended and extensively dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm PMSF, and 1mm benzamidine. The salt concentration of the dialysate was adjusted to 50 mm and subjected to DEAE-cellulose chromatography. HA-TM1 was eluted with 0.3 m NaCl containing buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA and 2.5 mm PMSF), reprecipitated with ammonium sulfate (100% saturation to concentrate the eluate), and dialyzed. The protein sample was further purified by affinity chromatography on HA epitope affinity column (Roche Applied Science) as per the manufacturer's instructions. HA-TM1 was eluted with 1 mg/ml HA epitope peptide (Roche Applied Science) and dialyzed against the binding assay buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA). In Vitro Actin Binding Studies—Actin binding assays were performed as described previously (29Heald R.W. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5254-5259Google Scholar) with modifications (30Hammell R.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4236-4242Google Scholar). HA-TM1 and wild type TM2 were cosedimented at 20 °C with chicken pectoral muscle F-actin (5 μm) in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The amounts of bound and free tropomyosin in the supernatants and pellets were quantitated by densitometry of SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained in Coomassie Blue using a Molecular Dynamics model 300A computing densitometer (Amersham Biosciences). To separate HA-TM1 from actin, the gels also contained 6 m urea. The free tropomyosin in the supernatants was calculated from standard curves for wild type tropomyosin. The curve for TM2 was fit using the Hill equation using SigmaPlot (SPSS Science, Chicago) that reported a Kapp. Cross-linking Studies—Homodimers of TM1 were stabilized by cross-linking with 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (24Prasad G.L. Fuldner R.A. Braverman R. McDuffie E. Cooper H.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 1-10Google Scholar, 31Lehrer S.S. Joseph D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 256: 1-9Google Scholar) (DTNB) (Sigma), a sulfhydryl cross-linker, as described previously (24Prasad G.L. Fuldner R.A. Braverman R. McDuffie E. Cooper H.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 1-10Google Scholar). Cell lysates were incubated with DTNB and were either subjected to immunoblotting (for unlabeled samples) or immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (for 35S-labeled samples). Dimers are detectable when 2-mercaptoethanol is omitted in the gel sample buffer. Statistical Analyses—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. from at least three independent determinations. p values were calculated by Student's two-tailed t test (32Glantz S.A. Primer of Biostatistics. 4th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1997Google Scholar) using the software provided in Microsoft Excel (2002 edition). In vitro studies have indicated that the N- and C-terminal ends of TMs are critical for binding to actin. Several studies have shown that some TMs, including TM1, require the acetylated N terminus for optimal binding to actin. N-terminal extensions, depending on the length and sequence, can alter TM functions (33Cho Y.J. Liu J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 538-545Google Scholar, 34Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Google Scholar, 35Urbancikova M. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24310-24315Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of TM1-mediated tumor suppression, we have modified the N-terminal end of TM1 molecule by introducing a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. This epitope tag contains three prolines and would not be predicted to be α-helical. This tagged protein, referred to as HA-TM1, contains a 19-residue N-terminal extension, which otherwise is identical to the wild type protein, and retains all the actin binding domains of TM1. We tested the ability of HA-TM1 to regulate cytoskeletal organization and growth phenotype. N-terminal Modification Abolishes TM1-mediated Cytoskeletal Reorganization and Tumor Suppression—We have used DT (NIH3T3 cells transformed by v-Ki-ras) cells as a model and transfected them with HA-TM1. Stable single cell clones, designated as DT/HA-TM1, were isolated. DT cells express TM1 at 50% levels compared with normal NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and TM2 and TM3 at essentially undetectable levels (18Prasad G.L. Fuldner R.A. Cooper H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7039-7043Google Scholar). Expression of HA-TM1 was detected by Northern blot (not shown) and immunoblot methods (Fig. 1A). The variant protein, because of the N-terminal extension, migrates slower than wild type TM1 on SDS-PAGE. The expression of endogenous TM1 in parental DT and DT/HA-TM1 cells is determined by the ratio of TM1: α-tubulin. In DT cells, the relative expression of TM1 was 0.7 ± 0.12, and in DT/HA-TM1 cells, the endogenous TM1 was expressed at 0.75 ± 0.08, indicating that the transfected HA-TM1 did not alter the levels of the endogenous wild type protein (p < 1). Morphologically DT cells are spindle-shaped, lack stress fibers, and are not contact-inhibited. Because TM1 induces reorganization of the cytoskeleton to restore stress fibers with attendant cell spreading, we examined whether HA-TM1 alters the cell morphology. Morphologically, DT/HA-TM1 cells resembled parental DT and empty vector transfected cells. DT/HA-TM1 cells displayed spindle-shaped morphology, were not subject to contact inhibition and formed multiple foci (Fig. 1B). Confocal microscopy revealed that HA-TM1 expression, unlike that of the wild type TM1 protein (18Prasad G.L. Fuldner R.A. Cooper H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7039-7043Google Scholar), did not induce the formation of stress fibers (Fig. 1C). Because TM1 induces cytoskeletal reorganization with the assembly of stress fibers, it is likely that enhanced TM1 levels may increase the levels of F-actin. Therefore, we examined whether TM1 up-regulates F-actin levels and whether the inability of the variant protein to reorganize cytoskeleton is reflected in lower F-actin content. Overnight cultures of NIH3T3 cells, DT cells, DT/TM1, and DT/HA-TM1 cells were fixed, and the F-actin content was determined using TRITC-conjugated phalloidin. The fluorescent intensities were normalized to 1.5 × 105 cells (Table I). Consistent with the degree of microfilament organization, NIH3T3 cells contained most F-actin. DT and DT/HA-TM1 cells contained comparable amounts of F-actin, but exhibited significantly lower F-actin than NIH3T3 cells, as measured by fluorescence intensity (p < 0.02). Enhanced expression of TM1 resulted in the reemergence of microfilaments, which reflected in increased F-actin content. F-actin content was significantly higher in DT/TM1 cells (1.97 ± 0.32) compared with DT cells (1.01 ± 0.24) (p < 0.03). However, the total actin content in DT-derived cells was unchanged, when quantitated by immunoblotting and expressed relative to tubulin (Table I).Table ITM1 enhances the cellular F-actin content F-actin content was determined by measuring the fluorescence of TRITC-labeled phalloidin, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Means ± S.D. are derived from three independent experiments. Relative fluorescence was normalized to 1.5 × 105 cells. Total actin and tubulin content were measured in 50 μg of protein from the indicated cell lines by immunoblotting. The ratio of actin to tubulin is taken as a measure of total actin content. The p values reported in the text are calculated by two-tailed paired t test.Cell typeF-actin contentTotal actin contentfluorescence unitsactin/tubulinNIH3T33.63 ± 0.811.36 ± 0.11DT1.01 ± 0.241.15 ± 0.2DT/TM11.97 ± 0.321.18 ± 0.11DT/HA-TM10.72 ± 0.011.13 ± 0.12 Open table in a new tab Next we determined whether HA-TM1 altered the growth properties of DT cells. Variant TM1 did not affect either the monolayer growth or anchorage-independent growth rates of DT cells (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, wild type TM1 significantly decreased monolayer growth compared with HA-TM1 (p < 0.005), comparable with the NIH3T3 cells. Consistent with its inability to alter the cytoskeletal organization and morphology, HA-TM1 expression did not affect the anchorage-independent growth of DT cells. DT/HA-TM1 cells grew rapidly and formed colonies in soft agar as efficiently as the parental DT cells or vector control cells. In contrast, DT/TM1 cells failed to grow under anchorage-independent growth conditions (18Prasad G.L. Fuldner R.A. Cooper H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7039-7043Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal modification of TM1 abolishes the ability of TM1 to induce cytoskeletal reorganization and inhibits its anti-oncogenic properties. HA-TM1 Disrupts Microfilaments in Normal Fibroblasts— Next, we investigated whether the modification of the N terminus of TM1 would interfere with the ability of TM1 to associate with existing normal microfilament structures. NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with HA-TM1 (Fig. 3A). HA-TM1 incorporated into microfilaments and colocalized with F-actin. The HA-TM1 was distributed uniformly throughout the cytoskeleton, a finding consistent with a previous report (27Gimona M. Watakabe A. Helfman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9776-9780Google Scholar). However, examination of the microfilament architecture after extended periods (48–72 h) revealed severe disruptions in microfilaments (Fig. 3B). Cells expressing HA-TM1 generally lacked well defined linear microfilaments that traverse the cell, which are typical of NIH3T3 cells. Instead, the transfected cells displayed wavy and disorganized microfilaments containing the variant protein and F-actin filaments, and aberrant cellular morphology when compared with the untransfected cells. These findings suggest that HA-TM1 associates with microfilaments and subsequently perturbs the cytoarchitecture (Fig. 3B). Transient transfection typically produces an overabundance of the gene product, which could potentially result in artifacts. In this case, enhanced expression of a TM protein could perturb intracellular TM pools, leading to aberrant cytoskeleton, an effect independent of the N-terminal modification of TM1. To rule out the effects of overabundance of the transfected protein, we have examined the microfilament organization in NIH3T3 cell lines that were stably transduced with TM1 (NIH3T3/TM1 cells) (24Prasad G.L. Fuldner R.A. Braverman R. McDuffie E. Cooper H.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 1-10Google Scholar). Enhanced expression of TM1 did not disorganize microfilaments, as did the variant protein (Fig. 3C). TM1 colocalized with linear, well defined stress fibers, and the normal cellular morphology was not compromised in NIH3T3/TM1 cells. These results indicate that enhanced TM1 expression per se does not induce disorganized cytoskeleton. Because TMs dimerize in “head to tail” fashion and associate with actin, modification of the N terminus of TM1 could have interfered with either dimerization or binding to actin, or both. To investigate further the effects of the N-terminal modification of TM1 molecule, we have stably transfected NIH3T3 cells with HA-TM1 (Fig. 3D). Immunofluorescence experiments show that microfilaments are often “pushed” to a side, and a substantial amount of variant TM1 occupies the perinuclear area. Variant TM1 is also colocalized with phalloidin-positive microfilaments, indicating that during dynamic reorganization of stress fibers, the HA-TM1 associates with filaments. The variant protein, because of its abundance, may compete with the endogenous TM1, although the F-actin binding and dimerization properties of TM1 and variant TM1 significantly differ (see below). However, it is possible that HA-TM1 and endogenous TM1 coexist in the stress fibers. Light microscopic observation of NIH3T3/HA-TM1 cells revealed the presence of high number of binucleated cells, indicating defects in cytokinesis in the transfected cells (Fig. 4).

https://openalex.org/W2062412237,"A novel anti-5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) polyclonal antiserum that specifically recognizes protein radical-derived DMPO nitrone adducts has been developed. In this study, we employed this new approach, which combines the specificity of spin trapping and the sensitivity of antigen-antibody interactions, to investigate protein radical formation from lactoperoxidase (LPO). When LPO reacted with GSH in the presence of DMPO, we detected an LPO radical-derived DMPO nitrone adduct using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting. The formation of this nitrone adduct depended on the concentrations of GSH, LPO, and DMPO as well as pH values, and GSH could not be replaced by H2O2. The level of this nitrone adduct was decreased significantly by azide, catalase, ascorbate, iodide, thiocyanate, phenol, or nitrite. However, its formation was unaffected by chemical modification of free cysteine, tyrosine, and tryptophan residues on LPO. ESR spectra showed that a glutathiyl radical was formed from the LPO/GSH/DMPO system, but no protein radical adduct could be detected by ESR. Its formation was decreased by azide, catalase, ascorbate, iodide, or thiocyanate, whereas phenol or nitrite increased it. GSH caused marked changes in the spectrum of compound II of LPO, indicating that GSH binds to the heme of compound II, whereas phenol or nitrite prevented these changes and reduced compound II back to the native enzyme. GSH also dose-dependently inhibited the peroxidase activity of LPO as determined by measuring 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) oxidation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the GSH-dependent LPO radical formation is mediated by the glutathiyl radical, possibly via the reaction of the glutathiyl radical with the heme of compound II to form a heme-centered radical trapped by DMPO.

Oxidation of thiols by peroxidases is of interest because peroxidases have been shown to catalyze thiol oxidation without H2O2 addition (1Yamazaki I. Yokota K. Mol. Cell.

LPO possesses antibacterial properties and is found in several biological fluids such as milk, tears, and saliva (16Ferrari R.P. Laurenti E. Cecchini P.I. Gambino O. Sondergaard I. J. Inorg.

In vivo, LPO is thought to catalyze the oxidation of thiocyanate, iodide, and bromide; in vitro, it is able to oxidize many other substrates (19Metodiewa D. Reszka K. Dunford H.B. Arch. Biochem.

Inactivation of LPO by the thiol compound methylmercaptoimidazole, a potent antithyroid drug, has also been reported (22Bandyopadhyay U. Bhattacharyya D.K. Chatterjee R. Banerjee R.K. Biochem.

Rather, horseradish peroxidase and LPO oxidize thiol substrates by one-electron oxidation to form thiyl radical metabolites (9Harman L.S. Mottley C. Mason R.P. J. Biol.

However, protein radicals are now well recognized as normal intermediates for an increasing number of enzymes and some peroxidase-like hemoproteins. Examples of such radical intermediates include the thiyl radical of ribonucleotide reductase (29Licht S. Gerfen G.J. Stubbe J.

GSH, a cysteine-containing tripeptide, is ubiquitously distributed in nature and is the most abundant low molecular weight thiol in mammalian cells. Therefore, it is of great importance to further investigate the role of GSH in peroxidase-mediated oxidation reactions. Recently, a novel rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the nitrone spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) has been developed and validated in the horse heart metmyoglobin/H2O2 system, where DMPO is known to trap the tyrosyl 103 radical (38Detweiler C.D. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Chignell C.F. Germolec D. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This new approach, which combines the specificity of spin trapping and the sensitivity of antigen-antibody interactions, has been employed to detect the amino acid radicals formed on oxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin in the presence of H2O2 (37Ramirez D.C. Chen Y.R. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The anti-DMPO serum specifically recognizes protein radical-derived DMPO nitrone adducts, which are stable end products of the DMPO/protein radical adduct intermediates (see schemes in Refs. 37Ramirez D.C. Chen Y.R. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and 38Detweiler C.D. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Chignell C.F. Germolec D. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, ESR spin trapping using DMPO as a spin trap detects the transient DMPO/protein radical adducts. Unfortunately, only a few protein radicals such as tyrosyl radicals of myoglobin (34Gunther M.R. Sturgeon B.E. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and thiyl radicals of human myoglobin (39Witting P.K. Douglas D.J. Mauk A.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3308-3314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have been trapped by DMPO and detected by ESR, and even in these cases, high concentrations of proteins had to be used. Therefore, in the detection of protein-derived radicals in biological systems, the sensitive immunochemical detection of protein radical-derived DMPO nitrone adducts is not only complementary to the ESR DMPO spin-trapping technique, but a usually superior replacement (37Ramirez D.C. Chen Y.R. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this study, we immunochemically investigated protein radical formation in the interaction of LPO with GSH. For the first time, we detected the GSH-dependent LPO radical-derived DMPO nitrone adduct by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot assays, demonstrating the formation of a protein radical on LPO, which has not been detected by ESR using DMPO as a spin trap agent. Thus, immunochemical detection of protein radical-derived DMPO nitrone adducts has been used for the first time to explore the free radical-mediated protein radical formation that has not been successfully detected by ESR. Chemicals—LPO (80-150 units/mg of protein, A412/A280 = 0.88-0.95), sodium iodide, sodium thiocyanate, sodium nitrite, sodium azide, potassium cyanide, N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), ascorbic acid, GSH, cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, dihydrolipoic acid (or 6,8-thioctic acid, reduced), cysteamine, homocysteine, captopril, penicillamine, mercaptosuccinic acid, methylmercaptoimidazole, cysteine methyl ester, cysteine ethyl ester, sodium sulfide, and GSSG were from Sigma. 2-Mercaptoethanol was obtained from Bio-Rad. The concentration of LPO was optically determined at λ = 412 nm (ϵ = 112 mm-1 cm-1) (21Kohler H. Taurog A. Dunford H.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 41Bruck T.B. Fielding R.J. Symons M.C. Harvey P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3214-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide was from Fisher. Beef liver catalase was obtained from Roche Applied Science. 2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. DMPO (high purity, ≥99%) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Ultrapure phenol was from Invitrogen. All other chemicals used were analytical grade. Chemical Modification of Free Cysteine, Tyrosine, and Tryptophan Residues on LPO—Free cysteine residues on LPO were blocked by mixing native LPO with N-ethylmaleimide at a molar ratio of 1:20. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then passed through a prepacked Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10, Amersham Biosciences) to remove excess N-ethylmaleimide. Chemical modification of tyrosine residues on LPO by iodination was initialized by the addition of two N-chlorobenzenesulfonamide-immobilized beads (IODO-BEADS, Pierce) to the reaction mixture containing LPO and NaI at a molar ratio of 1:20. The reaction was allowed to proceed with shaking at 25 °C for 15 min. To stop the reaction, the solution was passed through a PD-10 column to remove excess NaI. Chemical modification of tryptophan residues on LPO with NBS was performed as described previously (42Clarke A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, NBS was incubated with LPO in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 25 °C for 15 min at a molar ratio of 1:25. To terminate the reaction, the incubation solution was passed through a PD-10 column to remove excess NBS. Chemical Reactions—Typically, 0.2 μm native or modified LPO reacted with 2 mm GSH in the presence of 100 mm DMPO with or without 100 μm H2O2. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 mm ascorbic acid, and then the LPO radical-derived DMPO nitrone adduct was quantified by ELISA or Western blotting as described below. Anti-DMPO Antiserum—A rabbit anti-DMPO nitrone adduct polyclonal antiserum was obtained and first applied in our laboratory (38Detweiler C.D. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Chignell C.F. Germolec D. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used this antiserum to immunochemically evaluate the LPO radical-derived DMPO nitrone adduct in the mixture containing LPO and GSH in the presence of DMPO. ELISA—The LPO radical-derived DMPO nitrone adduct was determined using a standard ELISA in 96-well plates (Greiner Labortechnik, Frickenhausen, Germany). One-hundred μl of the adduct solution (1.5 μg of protein) in 200 μl of distilled water was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. The plates were washed once with wash buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, 0.05% casein, and 0.05% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4) and blocked with coating buffer (0.1 m bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) containing 2.5% casein and 2.5% bovine serum albumin) for 90 min. Thereafter, the rabbit anti-DMPO serum diluted 1:5000 in wash buffer was added and incubated for 60 min. After four washes, the secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, Pierce) diluted 1:5000 in wash buffer was added and incubated for 60 min. After four more washes, the antigen-antibody complexes were developed using a chemiluminescence system (CDP-Star, Roche Applied Science), and the light emitted was recorded in arbitrary units using Xfluor software (Tecan U.S., Research Triangle Park, NC). Western Blotting—After the reaction of LPO and GSH or H2O2 in the presence or absence of DMPO, the samples were dialyzed twice against 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 6 h. The proteins (1.0 μg/lane) were separated on reducing 4-12% BisTris NuPAGE (Invitrogen) and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with a solution of 2.5% bovine serum albumin and 2.5% casein in 1× Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 90 min. After four washes with wash buffer, the membrane was incubated for 90 min with the primary antibody (rabbit anti-DMPO serum diluted 1:5000 in wash buffer), after which the membrane was washed four times and incubated for 60 min with the secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG) at a dilution of 1:5000 in wash buffer. After another four washes, antigen-antibody complexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Nitro Block II, Tropix Inc., Bradford, MA; and CDP-Star), and the nitrocellulose membrane was exposed to x-ray film. SDS-PAGE—Cross-linking experiments were carried out at 25 or 37 °C for 5 or 60 min. After the reactions of LPO with H2O2 or GSH were terminated by the addition of catalase for the systems containing H2O2 or ascorbic acid for the system containing GSH, the proteins were separated on reducing 4-12% BisTris NuPAGE and then stained with Coomassie Blue. ESR Spin-trapping Measurements—ESR spectra were obtained with a Bruker ElexSys E500 spectrometer equipped with a super high Q cavity operating at 9.78 GHz and room temperature. The ESR spectrometer settings were as follows: modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 2.0 G; microwave power, 20 milliwatts; receiver gain, 2 × 105; time constant, 164 ms; conversion time, 82 ms; and magnetic field scan, 80 G. Oxygen Consumption Experiments—Oxygen consumption measurements were made with a Clark-type oxygen electrode fitted to a 1.8-ml Gilson sample cell and monitored by a Model 53 oxygen monitor (YSI Inc.). The reagents were added in the following order. First, 100 mm phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing 2 or 10 mm GSH in the presence or absence of either 0.01 mg/ml catalase or 100 mm DMPO was placed in the sample cell. Then, after establishing a 1-min base-line measurement, reactions were initiated by the addition of 8 μm LPO to the reaction chamber. Oxygen concentration in the samples as a function of time was recorded by a PC interfaced to the oxygen monitor with a Data Translation DT2801 data acquisition board. All experiments were done at room temperature with gentle stirring. Effect of GSH on the Spectrum of Compound II of LPO in the Presence and Absence of Phenol and Nitrite—Spectrometric measurements were performed at room temperature with a Beckman DU®640 spectrometer. Compound II of LPO is predominant whenever LPO is exposed to a small excess of H2O2 (21Kohler H. Taurog A. Dunford H.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 43Huwiler M. Jenzer H. Kohler H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 44Jenzer H.

The reaction was started by adding 2 mm GSH with or without 1 mm phenol or nitrite to compound II, which had been formed by the addition of 4 μm H2O2 to 2 μm LPO. The spectra were recorded with time by scanning from 350 to 700 nm. Effect of GSH on the Peroxidase Activity of LPO—Peroxidase activity was measured using ABTS (41Bruck T.B. Fielding R.J. Symons M.C.

For ABTS oxidation, 0.2 μm LPO was preincubated with various concentrations of GSH for 60 min in 96-well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). After three washes with 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to remove excess GSH, 300 μl of the ABTS assay solution containing 0.5 mm ABTS and 100 μm H2O2 in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was added to each well. Spectral absorption was recorded with time at 415 nm. For guaiacol oxidation, after 0.2 μm LPO was preincubated with various concentrations of GSH for 60 min in 96-well plates, the plates were washed three times with 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to remove excess GSH, and 300 μl of the guaiacol assay solution containing 5 mm guaiacol and 50 μm H2O2 in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was added to each well. Spectral absorption was monitored with time at 470 nm. Protein Radical Formation from LPO by GSH in the Presence of DMPO as Determined by ELISA and Western Blot Analyses—When 0.2 μm LPO and GSH were incubated for 1 h in the presence of 100 mm DMPO, an LPO radical-derived DMPO nitrone adduct was generated and detected by ELISA (Fig. 1A). GSH at >0.5 mm increased the formation of this nitrone adduct in a dose-dependent manner, with or without exogenously added H2O2, until a saturation point was reached. When GSH, LPO, or DMPO was omitted, no protein radical-derived nitrone adducts were detected. No LPO radical-derived nitrone adduct was detected when GSH was replaced either by its oxidized form (GSSG) or by H2O2 (data not shown). The amount of nitrone adduct formed increased with incubation time and approached saturation after 1 h of incubation (Fig. 1B). When Western blot assay was used instead of ELISA, we again detected the LPO radical-derived DMPO nitrone adduct generated from the interaction of LPO with GSH (Fig. 1D). Similarly, the levels of this nitrone adduct increased with increasing GSH concentrations (Fig. 1D, lanes 6 and 7), but H2O2 could not mediate its formation (lane 3). The amount of LPO remained the same under the different conditions (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 2A, H2O2 at <50 μm did not show any effects on the formation of the LPO radical-derived DMPO nitrone adduct no matter what concentration of GSH was used. However, when the concentration of H2O2 was increased to 50 μm, H2O2 significantly increased its formation in the system containing the higher concentration of GSH (10 mm) while significantly decreasing its formation in the system containing the lower concentration of GSH (0.5 mm). Exogenous H2O2 still had no effect on the system containing 2 mm GSH (data not shown). Fig. 2 (B and C) show that the formation of the LPO radical-derived nitrone adduct depended on the concentrations of LPO and DMPO, respectively. In addition, its formation increased as the pH increased from 5.0 to 8.0 and then decreased with a further increase in pH (Fig. 2D), which coincides with the deprotonation of GSH (pKa(SH) = 8.8) (13Svensson B.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Twelve thiol compounds were also examined for their ability to mediate the protein radical formation from LPO in the absence of H2O2. As shown in Fig. 3, at the same concentration of 1 mm, dihydrolipoic acid and dithiothreitol, which have two sulfhydryl groups, showed the strongest ability to mediate the LPO radical formation, whereas 2-mercaptoethanol, cysteine ethyl ester, and cysteine methyl ester showed the weakest ability, followed by mercaptosuccinic acid. However, no LPO radical formation was detected in the presence of some other thiol compounds such as methylmercaptoimidazole and the sulfide compound Na2S (data not shown). Effects of Inhibitors on LPO Radical Formation—To elucidate the mechanism of the GSH-dependent LPO radical formation, the effects of various inhibitors were examined. As shown in Fig. 4, LPO radical formation was strongly inhibited in the presence of 1 mm sodium azide, suggesting that the heme of LPO is required for the radical formation. Its formation was also inhibited by 70% in the presence of 50 μg/ml catalase and completely inhibited by 100 μg/ml catalase (data not shown), revealing a critical role for trace amounts of H2O2 in protein radical formation. Additionally, its formation was markedly decreased by 0.5 mm ascorbate and completely inhibited by >2 mm ascorbate (data not shown). As little as 10 μm I- and SCN-, which are excellent two-electron donors for LPO compound I (48Furtmuller P.G. Jantschko W. Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Arnhold J. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11895-11900Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), inhibited LPO radical formation by 88 and 89%, respectively. Phenol and nitrite at 1 mm, which are excellent one-electron donors for LPO compounds I and II (41Bruck T.B. Fielding R.J. Symons M.C. Harvey P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3214-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 49Zhang H. Dunford H.B. Can. J. Chem. 1993; 71: 1990-1994Crossref Google Scholar), inhibited LPO radical formation by 94 and 93%, respectively. Spin Trapping of the Glutathiyl Radical from the Reaction of LPO with GSH in the Presence of DMPO—Although GSH has been reported to be a relatively poor substrate for LPO (13Svensson B.E. Biochem.

To elucidate the relationship between the formation of the LPO radical and the glutathiyl radical (GS·), the glutathiyl radical was trapped by DMPO and monitored by ESR. When 0.2 μm LPO reacted with 2 mm GSH in the presence of 100 mm DMPO (Fig. 5, Control), an ESR spectrum typical of the DMPO/·SG adduct was obtained (Fig. 5, inset). This ESR spectrum was simulated using hyperfine coupling constants (aN = 15.13 G and aβH = 16.14 G) similar to those in earlier reports (27Harman L.S. Carver D.K. Schreiber J. Mason R.P. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2014963592,"NTAK (neural- and thymus-derived activator for ErbB kinases), also known as neuregulin-2, is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, which binds directly to ErbB3 and ErbB4 and transactivates ErbB2. Because ErbB signaling has been implicated in various angiogenic mechanisms, the effect of NTAK (which has at least nine isoforms due to alternative splicing) in angiogenesis is explored. One isoform, NTAKγ, inhibited cell growth in terms of DNA synthesis and cell numbers in vascular endothelial cells specifically, whereas NTAKα and β had no activity. On the other hand, NTAKγ secreted by transfected MDA-MB-231 cells inhibited endothelial cell growth, and NTAKγ expressed in endothelial cells by adenovirus infection suppressed cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. The EGF-like domain of NTAKγ did not have this activity. The NTAKδ isoform, which had the Ig-like domain but not the EGF-like domain, inhibited proliferation of endothelial cells. NTAKδ prevented hyper-phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein and caused G1 arrest in endothelial cells. Both NTAKγ and δ isoforms displayed anti-angiogenic activity in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane in vivo. These results suggest that the active site of NTAK is localized outside of the EGF-like domain but within the N-terminal region, including the Ig-like domain, of NTAK.

One isoform, NTAKγ, inhibited cell growth in terms of DNA synthesis and cell numbers in vascular endothelial cells specifically, whereas NTAKα and β had no activity. On the other hand, NTAKγ secreted by transfected MDA-MB-231 cells inhibited endothelial cell growth, and NTAKγ expressed in endothelial cells by adenovirus infection suppressed cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. The EGF-like domain of NTAKγ did not have this activity. The NTAKδ isoform, which had the Ig-like domain but not the EGF-like domain, inhibited proliferation of endothelial cells. NTAKδ prevented hyper-phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein and caused G1 arrest in endothelial cells. Both NTAKγ and δ isoforms displayed anti-angiogenic activity in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane in vivo. These results suggest that the active site of NTAK is localized outside of the EGF-like domain but within the N-terminal region, including the Ig-like domain, of NTAK. Members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or ErbB1), ErbB2 (neu), ErbB3, and ErbB4 (1Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J.

NTAK has at least nine alternatively spliced isoforms, which are derived from the same gene as neuregulin-2 (NRG2) and divergent of neuregulin 1 (Don-1) (8Chang H. Riese II, D.J. Gillbert W.

Like NRG1, NTAK binds directly to ErbB3 and ErbB4 and transactivates ErbB1 and ErbB2 via heterodimerization with ErbB3 or ErbB4 (7Higashiyama S. Horikawa M. Yamada K. Ichino N. Nakano N. Nakagawa T.

Ishiguro H. Nagatsu T. Gene. 2000; 255: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Among the products of alternative splicing, the α isoform of the NTAK gene is expressed in all tissues including the brain, and the β isoform is restricted to the brain. The γ isoform is expressed in a rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC-12. NTAKδ is an isoform missing the EGF-like domain and is expressed in a human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH. NTAKα and β preferentially induce phosphorylation in ErbB3 and ErbB4, respectively, transactivate ErbB2, and stimulate growth of human breast cancer cells (14Nakano N. Higashiyama S. Kajihara K. Endo T. Ishiguro H. Yamada K. Nagatsu T. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, differences in the biological roles and the functions of the various NTAK isoforms are still unknown. The roles of ErbB overexpression in cellular transformation and tumor metastasis have been elucidated by a line of in vitro and clinical studies. Furthermore, targeted deletion of ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, or NRG1 in mice leads to developmental abnormalities that are severe in the nervous system and to lethality due to cardiovascular system failure (5Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 6Tzahar E. Yarden Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: M25-M37PubMed Google Scholar). The cardiac abnormalities include aborted development of the endocardial cushion, which is dependent on mesenchymal cell growth and development of the endocardial endothelium. Angiogenesis is the process of new vascular formation from preexisting blood vessels and is tightly regulated by the balance of angiogenic factors and inhibitors (15Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6113) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, vascular endothelial cells are quiescent due to the dominance of angiogenic inhibitory factors, including angiostatin (16O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C.

Date K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6737-6743PubMed Google Scholar). Angiogenesis occurs during pathological events such as solid tumor growth and metastasis, diabetic retinopathy, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Angiogenic inhibitors are capable of preventing tumor growth and metastasis, and, in fact, a number of angiogenic inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials for cancer treatment. ErbB signaling has also been implicated in angiogenesis. Neutralizing antibodies against ErbB1 and ErbB2 down-regulate VEGF and inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo (19Petit A.M.V. Rak J. Hung M-C. Rockwell P. Goldstein N. Fendly B. Kerbel R.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1523-1530PubMed Google Scholar). NRG1 has been reported to activate ErbBs in endothelial cells and induce angiogenesis (20Russell K.S. Stern D.F. Polverini P.J. Bender J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2205-H2211PubMed Google Scholar). NRG1 binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) via the Ig-like domain, and NRG1-HSPG interaction potentiates ErbB phosphorylation by the EGF-like domain of NRG1 (21Li Q. Loeb J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38068-38075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted deletion of the Ig-like domain of NRG1 in mice leads to the embryonic lethality associated with a deficiency of ventricular myocardial trabeculation and impairment of cranial ganglion development (22Kramer R. Bucay N. Kane D.J. Martin L.E. Tarpley J.E. Theill L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4833-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The Ig-like domain of NTAK is 38.2% identical to the corresponding domain of NRG1 (7Higashiyama S. Horikawa M. Yamada K. Ichino N. Nakano N. Nakagawa T. Miyagawa J. Matsushita N. Nagatsu T. Taniguchi N. Ishiguro H. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the function of the Ig-like domain of NTAK remains unknown. We scrutinized the angiogenic effects of NTAK isoforms and report herein that the N-terminal region of NTAK, including the Ig-like domain but not the EGF-like domain, inhibits angiogenesis and that NTAKδ causes G1 arrest in vascular endothelial cells. Materials—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). HUVECs were maintained in EBM-2 medium (Clonetics) and, in the assays, were grown in MCDB-131 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 10 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (PS). Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were isolated from bovine thoracic aortae using methods described previously (23Nakano N. Higashiyama S. Takashima S. Tsuruoka N. Klagsbrun M. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS, and PS. The anti-NTAK antibody, #N1-1, was raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 308–327 amino acid sequence (7Higashiyama S. Horikawa M. Yamada K. Ichino N. Nakano N. Nakagawa T. Miyagawa J. Matsushita N. Nagatsu T. Taniguchi N. Ishiguro H. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The anti-Rb antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The γEGF peptide (the EGF-like domain of NTAKγ, GHARKCNETAKSYCVNGGVCYYIEGINQLSCKG) was purchased from Peptide Institute (Minoh, Osaka, Japan). Preparation of Recombinant Proteins from Escherichia coli—The 1.2-kbp cDNA fragments corresponding to the extracellular regions of NTAKα2a, NTAKβ, NTAKγ, and NTAKδ were inserted into pASK-IBA6 vectors (Genosys Biotechnologies, The Woodlands, TX). The resulting plasmids were then used to transform E. coli DH5α, and the recombinant proteins were purified using a StrepTactin affinity column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Genosys Biotechnologies). Establishment of NTAKγ Gene-transfected MDA-MB-231 Cells—An expression vector of NTAKγ was constructed by inserting the full sequence of NTAKγ cDNA into pRc/CMV. The vector was transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells by the electroporation method, and selection was performed with G418 (Sigma-Aldrich). The conditioned media from each clone were concentrated using heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and NTAKγ expression was examined by Western blotting analyses using the anti-NTAK antibody, #N1-1 (7Higashiyama S. Horikawa M. Yamada K. Ichino N. Nakano N. Nakagawa T. Miyagawa J. Matsushita N. Nagatsu T. Taniguchi N. Ishiguro H. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Three highly expressing clones, 231γ-1, -2, and -3, were independently selected. Cell Growth Assay—For the cell number assay, cells were resuspended in the maintenance medium and then seeded onto collagencoated 24-well microplates (2 × 103 cells/1 ml/well). The plates were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C and then re-fed medium containing 2% FCS. After 12 h, the samples to be tested were added. After 2 days of incubation, the cells were harvested and counted using a Coulter counter (Coulter Electronics, Luton, England). For the assay of DNA synthesis, cells were resuspended in the maintenance medium and then seeded onto collagen-coated 96-well microplates (2 × 103 cells/200 μl/well). The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and then re-fed medium containing 5% FCS. After 3 h, the samples or growth factors to be tested for inhibitory activity were added. After a 24-h incubation, 10 μl (37 kBq) of [3H]thymidine was added, and incubation was continued for another 6 h. The [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting (1450 MicroBeta TRILUX; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To determine HUVEC growth, HUVECs were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/1 ml/well in collagen-coated 12-well microplates. After 12 h, the plates were re-fed MCDB-131/FCS (5%)/PS, followed by the addition of 20 ng/ml NTAKα or NTAKδ (Day 0). The plates were incubated for 48 h (Day 2) and then re-fed fresh MCDB-131/FCS (5%)/PS without NTAKs. Co-culture Assay—HUVECs were resuspended in the maintenance medium and then seeded onto collagen-coated 24-well microplates (2 × 104 cells/1 ml/well). The plates were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C and re-fed with MCDB-131 supplemented with 5% FCS and 5 ng/ml FGF-2. The inner cup (Intercell ST, Kurabo, Neyagawa, Japan) containing MDA-MB-231 cells or transfectants (1 × 104 cells/100 μl/well) was placed. After a 24 h incubation, DNA synthesis and cell number were measured as described above. Inhibitory Effect of Adenoviral Vectors—We used an adenovirus expression vector kit (Takara, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan) that carries a cytomegalovirus-driven cDNA for full-length NTAKγ. For the cell growth assay, we measured DNA synthesis in HUVECs infected by adenovirus for 24 h, as described above. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Analyses of Retinoblastoma Protein—To synchronize the cells in a quiescent state (G0), the cells were cultured in starvation medium containing 0.5% FCS for 16 h and re-fed fresh medium with or without 50 ng/ml NTAKδ. Cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was incubated with anti-Rb antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and then with 20 μl of protein A-Trisacryl (50% suspension; Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins in the gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in 150 mm CAPS buffer, pH 10.5, containing 20% methanol. The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk in PBS overnight at 4 °C and incubated with anti-Rb antibody in 5% skimmed milk/PBS for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times at 10-min intervals with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS and then incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed again three times at 10-min intervals with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS and then incubated with avidin-HRP (Vectastatin, Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature. The membrane was washed five times with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, and the horseradish peroxidase activity was detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) followed by autoradiography. In Vivo Angiogenesis Assay—Antiangiogenic activity in vivo was assayed using the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) method (24Tanaka N.G. Sakamoto N. Tohgo A. Nishiyama Y. Ogawa H. Exp. Pathol. 1996; 30: 143-150Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, fertilized white Leghorn chicken eggs were incubated at 37 °C for 5 days, and a methyl cellulose disk containing 100 μg of the samples to be tested was placed within a 5-mm-round sterilized silicon ring on CAM. The eggs were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. A white fat emulsion (Intralipos; Yoshitomi, Osaka, Japan) was injected into the chorioallantois and the vascular networks in the CAMs and photographed using a digital camera. Growth Inhibition of Endothelial Cells Stimulated by NTAK—NTAK has at least nine alternatively spliced isoforms. The differences in biological properties among NTAK isoforms remain unclear. To examine the effect of NTAK on angiogenesis, we examined three isoforms, NTAKα, β, and γ, whose structures differ in their EGF-like domain (Fig. 1). We analyzed the DNA synthesis of BAECs stimulated by recombinant NTAKs. NTAKα and β dose-dependently induced phosphorylation of ErbBs in MDA-MB-453 and T47D cells within the 1–10 ng/ml range (14Nakano N. Higashiyama S. Kajihara K. Endo T. Ishiguro H. Yamada K. Nagatsu T. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). At these levels, NTAKα and β had neither stimulatory nor inhibitory effects on [3H]thymidine incorporation by BAECs, but NTAKγ inhibited it in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Similarly, NTAKα and β isoforms had no effects on the proliferation of BAE cells, whereas NTAKγ was inhibitory (Fig. 2B). The inhibitory activity of NTAKγ was comparable with that of a typical angiogenic inhibitor, TNF-α (25Frater-Schroeder M. Muller G. Birchmeier W. Boehlen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, NTAKγ had no effects on the growth of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), T47D cells, MDA-MB-453 cells, or SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 2C). 2N. Nakano and S. Higashiyama, unpublished observations. Thus, it is suggested that the growth inhibitory activity of NTAKγ is specific for vascular endothelial cells.Fig. 2Growth inhibition of endothelial cells stimulated by NTAK. A, BAECs were seeded onto 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 103 cells/well, and, after a 24-h incubation, the cells were re-fed medium containing 2% FCS in the presence of NTAKα (closed circles), NTAKβ (open circles), or NTAKγ (open triangles). After another 24 h of incubation, the cells were incubated with [3H]thymidine for another 6 h, and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting. B, BAECs were seeded onto 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 103 cells/well, and, after a 12 h incubation, the cells were re-fed medium containing 2% FCS in the presence of NTAKα (closed circles), NTAKβ (open circles), NTAKγ (open triangles), or TNF-α (open squares). After 2 days of incubation, the cells were harvested and counted. Each point is the mean ± S.D. of triplicate measurements. C, SMCs were seeded onto 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 103 cells/well, and, after a 12-h incubation, the cells were re-fed medium containing 2% FCS in the presence of NTAKα (closed circles), NTAKβ (open circles), NTAKγ (open triangles), or TNF-α (open squares). After 2 days of incubation, the cells were harvested and counted. Each point is the mean ± S.D. of triplicate measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Growth Inhibition of Endothelial Cells Co-cultured with NTAKγ Transfectants—Human breast cancer-derived MDA-MB-231 cells are undifferentiated cells that are invasive by nature and secrete angiogenic factors such as VEGF and FGF-2 (26El Yazidi I. Boilly-Marer Y. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 783-790PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hyder S.M. Murthy L. Stancel G.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 392-395PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether NTAKγ was capable of antagonizing these angiogenic factors. We transfected a plasmid containing the full-length NTAKγ cDNA and the neomycin resistance gene into MDA-MB-231 cells. Three cell lines, 231γ-1, -2, and -3, secreting high levels of NTAKγ, were obtained and co-cultured with HUVECs. These transfectants secreted VEGF and FGF-2 as verified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). The [3H]thymidine incorporation into HUVECs in the lower chambers was increased by the angiogenic factors secreted byMDA-MB-231cells in the upper chambers. When three transfectants were cocultured in the upper chambers, [3H]thymidine incorporation into HUVECs was reduced to the basal level (Fig. 3A), and the expected increase in HUVEC number was inhibited (Fig. 3B). Thus, NTAKγ was able to reduce the growth of endothelial cells to the basal level, probably by antagonizing angiogenic factors. Growth Inhibition of Adenovirus-infected HUVEC—We then evaluated potential therapeutic actions via NTAK delivery. HUVECs were infected with adenoviral vectors encoding NTAKγ or a control. The expressions of vectors were verified histochemically by β-galactosidase activity. The DNA synthesis of HUVECs infected by the adenoviral vector encoding NTAKγ was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, and the half-maximal effectiveness was ∼5 × 102 multiplicities of infection (Fig. 4). The cells showed no morphological changes, and the control vector had no effect on HUVEC proliferation. Thus, growth inhibition of HUVECs was not due to the cytotoxic effect of viral infection but to NTAKγ expressed by adenoviral vectors. This suggested that NTAKγ has a potential therapeutic use for angiogenesis-related diseases. The Active Site of Angiogenic Inhibition in NTAK—NTAKα and β isoforms have complete EGF-like domain motifs, which have consensus sequences containing three disulfide bonds. On the contrary, the NTAKγ isoform has an incomplete EGF-like domain, which does not have the third cysteine loop (Fig. 1B). To investigate the active site of NTAK involved in angiogenic inhibition, we focused on the EGF-like domain of NTAKγ and synthesized a 33-amino acid-long peptide of γEGF corresponding to the region. In the assays of cell number and DNA synthesis, this γEGF peptide had no effect on the growth of HUVECs and BAECs at concentrations up to 3.3 nm (Fig. 5A and data not shown), whereas the NTAKγ protein showed an inhibitory activity at 10 ng/ml or 0.22 nm, as shown in Fig. 2, A and B. Detectable levels of ErbB phosphorylation were not induced by the NTAKγ or the γEGF peptide in Western blotting analysis.2 It was suggested, therefore, that the active site for the angiogenic inhibitory effect of NTAKγ existed in a region other than the EGF-like domain. Subsequently, we examined the angiogenic inhibitory effect of NTAKδ, which has the same N-terminal part, including the Ig-like domain, as the other isoforms but is missing the EGF-like domain (Fig. 1A). NTAKδ decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation into HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B) with no accompanying ErbB phosphorylation (data not shown). It is suggested that the anti-angiogenic activity of NTAK resides in the N-terminal region of NTAK, including the Ig-like domain, but not in the EGF-like domain of NTAKγ. NTAKδ Reduces Retinoblastoma Protein Phosphorylation in HUVEC—We investigated the mechanism underlying the angiogenic inhibitory effects of NTAKδ. Retinoblastoma protein (pRb) is the most important protein regulating cell cycle progression into the S phase, and hyper-phosphorylation of pRb inactivates of its growth inhibitory function (28Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4319) Google Scholar). We investigated whether NTAKδ affected pRb hyper-phosphorylation. When serum-starved HUVECs were re-fed fresh medium, the hyper-phosphorylation of pRb was increased. However, treatment of HUVECs with NTAKδ inhibited hyper-phosphorylation of pRb, suggesting that the G1 arrest was induced by NTAKδ (Fig. 6). To determine whether the inhibition of angiogenesis by NTAKδ is reversible, we analyzed HUVEC growth in response to with NTAKα or δ. HUVECs treated with 20 ng/ml NTAKδ became spindle-shaped on Day 1 and cell growth was reduced, whereas HUVECs treated with NTAKα proliferated normally (Fig. 7). The NTAKδ-treated cells did not show apoptotic or necrotic changes, and growth was restored when the medium was replaced, on Day2, with medium not containing NTAKδ. Thus, it was suggested that NTAKδ blocks cell cycle progression and causes G1 arrest in HUVECs. In Vivo Anti-angiogenic Activity of NTAK—The in vivo angiogenic inhibitory activity of NTAKs was examined using the CAM assay. NTAKα and control bovine serum albumin neither induced nor inhibited angiogenesis of chick microvessels on CAMs (Fig. 8, A and B). In contrast, the microvascular network formation was inhibited by NTAKγ and, more markedly, by NTAKδ (Fig. 8, C and D). Avascular areas were clearly formed surrounding the disks containing NTAKγ or NTAKδ. Thus, NTAKγ and NTAKδ, but not NTAKα, inhibited angiogenesis in vivo as well as in vitro. NTAK represents at least nine alternative splicing isoforms derived from the same gene as NRG2 (7Higashiyama S. Horikawa M. Yamada K. Ichino N. Nakano N. Nakagawa T. Miyagawa J. Matsushita N.

Effects of NTAK in angiogenesis have been suggested, because endothelial cells express ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 (20Russell K.S. Stern D.F. Polverini P.J. Bender J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2205-H2211PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant NTAKα and β isoforms using an E. coli expression system stimulated breast tumor cell growth and differentiation at physiological concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 ng/ml (14Nakano N. Higashiyama S. Kajihara K. Endo T. Ishiguro H. Yamada K. Nagatsu T. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, NTAKα and β neither stimulated nor inhibited endothelial cell growth. NTAKγ did not stimulate the phosphorylation of ErbBs in MDA-MB-453 and T47D cells (data not shown) but did inhibit endothelial cell growth in terms of DNA synthesis and increase of cell number (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, NTAKγ, as well as NTAKα and β, had no effect on the proliferation of SMCs, breast cancer cell lines, and neuroblastoma cell lines. These observations suggest that the cellular effect of NTAKγ, but not that of NTAKα and β, is specific for vascular endothelial cells. MDA-MB-231 cells secrete the angiogenic factors VEGF and FGF-2, which promote the growth of co-cultured endothelial cells. All three NTAKγ-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells, 231γ-1, -2 and -3, secreted these angiogenic factors (data not shown) and showed reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation and proliferation of HUVECs to the basal level. NTAKγ was able to antagonize the angiogenic activities such as VEGF and FGF-2 (Fig. 3). Furthermore, NTAKγ expression by adenoviral vector in HUVECs impaired DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). The angiogenic inhibitory activities of the NTAKγ and δ isoforms were demonstrated in vivo by CAM assays. NTAKα had neither stimulatory nor inhibitory effects on angiogenesis on CAMs. NTAKγ and NTAKδ inhibited new vessel formation (Fig. 8). Thus, NTAKγ and δ exhibited anti-angiogenic activities in vivo as well as in vitro, suggesting that these NTAKs may be possible candidate agents for suppression of tumor growth and metastasis. All members of the EGF family have the EGF-like domain with the consensus sequence containing three disulfide bonds. The EGF-like domain binds to receptor ErbB family members and promotes cell growth, differentiation, and survival. NTAKγ inhibited endothelial cell growth, whereas NTAKα and β had no effect. The structural differences among these NTAK isoforms are found only in the EGF-like domain. NTAKα and β isoforms have the full EGF-like domain motif, whereas NTAKγ has a truncated EGF-like domain missing the third cysteine loop. Unexpectedly, the γEGF peptide, corresponding to the EGF-like domain of NTAKγ, had no effect on the growth of HUVECs and BAECs at concentrations up to 3.3 nm, although NTAKγ exerted an inhibitory effect at 10 ng/ml (0.22 nm). Otherwise, NTAKδ, which has the Ig-like domain but not the EGF-like domain, inhibited angiogenesis. The γEGF peptide and the NTAKγ and δ isoforms did not stimulate ErbB phosphorylation (data not shown). The results suggest that the EGF-like domain of NTAKγ is not involved in the anti-angiogenic activity and that the active site is in the Ig-like domain. The function of the Ig-like domain of NTAK remains unknown. NTAK is structurally homologous to NRG1, and the Ig-like domain of NRG1 contains a heparin-binding site and increases ligand-receptor affinity (29Loeb J.A. Fischbach G.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Targeted deletion of the Ig-like domain of NRG1 leads to embryonic lethality. The Ig-like domain of NTAK may also interact with glycosaminoglycans on the cell surface and affect the interaction of NTAK with ErbBs. The structures of both the Ig-like and EGF-like domains of NTAK may be essential for ErbB interaction and the subsequent stimulation of cell growth. NTAK isoforms have the Ig-like domain exclusively. NTAKγ and δ isoforms showed angiogenic inhibitory activities, whereas the NTAKα and β isoforms did not. NTAKα and β isoforms presumably stimulate the growth of endothelial cells, because endothelial cells have ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. We can speculate that NTAKα and β have both angiogenic activities because of ErbB phosphorylation via the EGF-like domain and anti-angiogenic properties associated with other regions, including the Ig-like domain, which results in no net effects on cell growth. It is now well known that some of endogenous angiogenic inhibitors are fragments of proteins whose biological functions are unrelated to angiogenesis. For example, angiostatin and endostatin are proteolytic fragments of plasminogen (16O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3177) Google Scholar) and collagen XVIII (17O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Birkhead J.R. Olsen B.R. Folkman J. Cell. 1997; 88: 277-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4260) Google Scholar), respectively. NK4 is an internal fragment of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and is considered to be bifunctional, as it is an hepatocyte growth factor antagonist and an endogenous angiogenic inhibitor (18Kuba K. Matsumoto K. Date K. Shimura H. Tanaka M. Nakamura T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6737-6743PubMed Google Scholar). NK4 inhibits angiogenesis through another pathway than the c-Met receptor. It is also possible that NTAK proteins with the full EGF-like domain have no effects on angiogenesis and that only fragments of NTAK with the truncated EGF-like domain have the anti-angiogenic properties. The mechanism underlying the angiogenic inhibitory effects of NTAK isoforms remains unknown. NTAKγ and δ isoforms did not induce ErbB phosphorylation (data not shown). We have searched for a ligand binding NTAKγ on the endothelial cell surface but have not, to date, found it. NTAKδ inhibited hyper-phosphorylation of pRb in HUVECs, thus providing molecular confirmation of G1 arrest induced by NTAKδ. In addition, NTAKδ did not induce apoptotic or necrotic cell death of endothelial cells. We also investigated the effect of NTAKδ on other molecules involved in cell cycle regulation such as the p16, p21, and p27 proteins, but their expressions were unchanged on Western blotting analysis (data not shown). The therapeutic potential of angiogenic inhibitors for angiogenic diseases, such as malignant tumors and diabetic retinopathy, have been proposed. Pathological angiogenesis could be triggered either by up-regulation of angiogenic factors or down-regulation of endogenous angiogenic inhibitory factors. Angiogenic inhibitors have been shown to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, and some angiogenic inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical trials for cancer treatment. We found that the NTAKγ and δ isoforms had angiogenic inhibitory activities, and these isoforms of NTAK have therapeutic potential for angiogenic diseases. The EGF-ErbB family is involved in tumor growth, and EGF family members generally act as stimulators of tumor growth. This is the first report showing that molecules belonging to the EGF family inhibit angiogenesis. In summary, NTAKγ and δ isoforms, but not α and β isoforms, have angiogenic inhibitory activities in vitro and in vivo. The active sites are localized in the N-terminal region of NTAK containing the Ig-like domain but not the EGF-like domain. Further studies are needed to identify the target of NTAKγ and δ on the endothelial cell surface to delineate the mechanism underlying anti-angiogenesis. We thank Dr. A. Mammoto and M.

https://openalex.org/W2007717652,"The catalytic mechanism of dUTP pyrophosphatase (dUTPase), responsible for the prevention of uracil incorporation into DNA, involves ordering of the flexible C terminus of the enzyme. This conformational shift is investigated by multidimensional NMR on the Drosophila enzyme. Flexible segments of the homotrimer give rise to sharp resonances in the 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra, which are clearly distinguishable from the background resonances of the well folded protein globule. Binding of the product dUMP or the analogues dUDP and α,β-imino-dUTP to the enzyme induces a conformational change reflected in the disappearance of eight sharp resonances.

Emerging data indicate that homotrimeric eukaryotic, bacterial, and retroviral dUTPases can be classified into two subfamilies based on the hydropathy of subunit interfaces and the schedule of conformational changes along the catalytic cycle (1Mol C.D.

Commun. 2000; 279: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In particular, a conformational switch of the flexible C terminus containing dUTPase conserved motif 5 seems to be induced in an altered fashion between Escherichia coli and human or Drosophila melanogaster dUTPases (1Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainer J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 3Kovári J. Barabás O. Takács E. Békési A. Dubrovay Z.

In the previous study, experimental evidence has been presented arguing for an increased ordering of the fruit fly enzyme conformation that is induced by both the product dUMP and the nonhydrolyzable γ-phosphate lacking substrate analogue dUDP. Limited proteolysis experiments suggested that a conformational switch within the C-terminal segment contributes to the observed ordering. The experimental techniques, however, allowed only a low resolution structural estimation of the conformational changes. The conformational switch of the C terminus is essential in dUTPase function because it contributes to the formation of the catalytically competent closed enzyme molecular species (4Shao H.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A central question in the catalytic mechanism of dUTPase is whether this closed conformer may be induced only by binding of the γ-phosphate containing substrate dUTP, as in the case of the E. coli enzyme, or whether it may be retained in the product-enzyme complex. A high resolution experimental technique was sought that can provide adequate localization of the nucleotide-induced structural changes. It was also desirable to avoid crystallization-induced potential artifacts that may be especially misleading in the investigation of flexible loops capable of adopting an ordered conformation because of crystal packing interactions. The experiments were therefore restricted to the solution phase, and multidimensional NMR spectroscopy was considered to be the method of choice. High resolution structural analysis in the solution phase still presents a considerable challenge because of the presently observed size limitations of multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. We therefore anticipated that complete structural analysis of the 60-kDa Drosophila dUTPase trimer by NMR spectroscopy is not yet accessible. However, investigations restricted to the flexible regions of the protein were considered to be potentially rewarding. The flexible segments are expected to provide considerably sharper resonance peaks as compared with the resonances associated with atoms in the main bulk globule of the homotrimer. A similar approach was presented for investigations on E. coli and retroviral dUTPases (7Nord J. Nyman P. Larsson G. Drakenberg T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This study showed that sharp resonances observed in the ligand-free enzyme spectrum disappear upon formation of the complex between dUTPase and α,β-imino-dUTP but do not change when dUDP binds to the enzyme. However, it failed to provide assignment to the observed resonances. The major aim of the present study was to localize and assign the enzyme conformational changes induced by binding of dUMP, dUDP, or α,β-imino-dUTP in a eukaryotic dUTPase. The Drosophila enzyme was considered to be an excellent experimental object for this attempt because it was shown to contain three segments with distinct degrees of increased flexibilities (3Kovári J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17932-17944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These segments are as follows: residues 1-15, the 15-residue Drosophila-specific N-terminal region; residues 160-187, the 28-residue Drosophila-specific C-terminal region; and residues 149-159, the 11-residue segment just preceding the Drosophila-specific extension; this last segment contains conserved motif 5, characteristic for all dUTPases throughout evolution (cf. Figs. 1 and 5 in Ref. 3Kovári J. Barabás O. Takács E. Békési A. Dubrovay Z. Pongrácz V. Zagyva I. Imre T. Szabó P. Vértessy B.G. J. Biol.

HSQC, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra of 15N-labeled fly dUTPase allowed clear distinction of NMR resonance peaks and provided complete assignment for residues of dUTPase conserved motif 5. Retention of these segments during the lengthy NMR experiments was controlled by mass spectroscopic measurements. Kinetic analyses and NMR titration experiments suggested cooperativity in saturation of the three active sites. Chemicals, Enzyme Preparation, and Purification—dUDP and α,β-imino-dUDP were obtained from Jena Bioscience. α,β-Imino-dUTP was prepared by enzymatic phosphorylation of α,β-imino-dUDP (8Persson T.

The supernatant of lysed cells was purified by use of ion exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose column) performed by a Gradifrac system (Amersham Biosciences) and gel filtration (Superdex 200HR column) by a fast protein liquid chromatography system, as detailed in the previous study (3Kovári J.

NMR Spectroscopy—For NMR measurements, enzyme samples at a concentration of 1.75 mm were dialyzed against 81 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, also containing 5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% NaN3, and 10% D2O. 15N-1H HSQC (with 4096 data points in the direct dimension and 256 increments) as well as three-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC TOCSY and 1H-15N HSQC NOESY spectra of dUTPase (with 2048 data points in the direct dimension, 180 increments in the indirect 1H, and 64 in the 15N dimension) were recorded on a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer at T = 283 K. Apoenzyme was first measured, and then titration was carried out by stepwise addition of 3-5-μl aliquots of dUMP, dUDP, or α,β-imino-dUTP stock solutions into the enzyme solution. At each titration step, full HSQC spectra were recorded. At the end of the titrations, both types of the three-dimensional spectra were collected again. Resonance assignment was carried out in two steps. The results of HSQC TOCSY experiments were used to assign the residue types giving rise to the peak patterns, whereas the results of HSQC NOESY measurements were necessary to establish sequential connectivity between the identified spin systems. Analysis of the spectra was carried out by the programs XEASY and SYBYL. Mass Spectroscopy Measurements—Samples before and after NMR spectroscopy were submitted to mass spectrometric measurements to confirm the presence of the flexible N- and C-terminal enzyme segments during the lengthy NMR experiments. Frozen samples were thawed, and each was prepared for mass analysis following three different methods: either diluted 10-fold with 1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, dialyzed against 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, or purified on a C4 ZipTip (Millipore) and eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in ethanol: propanol (5:2). Mass spectra were recorded on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Reflex III, Bruker, Germany) using sinapinic acid as the matrix. Horse heart myoglobin in the same matrix was used for external calibration. The spectra were measured in positive linear mode with delayed extraction. 150-200 laser shots were summed. The molecular masses were determined as the averages of seven independent mass measurements. The mass accuracy was ∼0.1%. The three different sample preparation methods yielded the same results. Enzyme Kinetic Measurements—The substrate saturation curves were recorded using the continuous spectrophotometric dUTPase enzyme activity assay at enzyme concentrations of 50 nm in 1 mm TESHCl, pH 7.5, containing 40 μm dUTP, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, and 40 μm Phenol Red indicator (assay buffer) (3Kovári J.

A JASCO-V550 spectrophotometer and 10-mm-pathlength 25 °C thermostatted cuvettes were used. NMR Assignment of Nucleotide Binding Affected Motif 5 Residues in Drosophila dUTPase—In the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of full-length (1-187) D. melanogaster dUTPase, ∼50 sharp resonance lines could be identified (Fig. 1A). In addition, a wide background is also observable, with a high number of broad complex resonances. Under our experimental conditions with a 500-MHz frequency, it is expected that resonances that correspond to the main chain and side chain atoms well folded within the 60-kDa homotrimeric dUTPase will be observed only in a broad background (10Venters R.A. Thompson R. Cavanagh J. J. Mol. Struct. 2002; 602-603: 275-292Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Poor dispersion of many Hα and side chain resonances is also apparent from three-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC TOCSY experiments (not shown). The existence of clear sharp resonances indicates, however, that some moieties of the protein are characterized with an increased conformational freedom. The number of sharp resonances roughly corresponds to the number of residues in the flexible N- and C-terminal segments of the dUTPase chains (cf. protein amino acid sequence in Fig. 1 of the previous study (3Kovári J. Barabás O. Takács E. Békési A. Dubrovay Z. Pongrácz V. Zagyva I. Imre T. Szabó P. Vértessy B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17932-17944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)). In the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the 1-159 Drosophila dUTPase construct lacking the C-terminal 28 residues (not shown), the number of observable sharp resonances is only 22, i.e. 28 resonances are missing as compared with the spectrum of the full-length construct. These results, together with the limited proteolysis-based identification of the N- and C-terminal flexible segments (3Kovári J. Barabás O. Takács E. Békési A. Dubrovay Z. Pongrácz V. Zagyva I. Imre T. Szabó P. Vértessy B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17932-17944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), reinforce the interpretation that the sharp resonances originate from those segments that possess enhanced conformational freedom relative to the rest of the molecule. The retention of these flexible segments during the lengthy NMR experiments was confirmed by mass spectroscopic analysis of the protein before and after NMR spectroscopy (data not shown). No significant loss of protein segments was detected. The addition of α,β-imino-dUTP to dUTPase resulted in the disappearance of eight sharp resonance peaks from the HSQC spectrum (Fig. 1, A and B, lines identify affected residues). The analogue α,β-imino-dUTP is used in this study as an isosteric mimic of the true substrate dUTP (11Larsen M. Willett R. Yount R.G. Science. 1969; 1661510Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Yount R.G. Ojala D. Babcock D. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2490-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) that is largely resistant to hydrolysis. The same changes were also induced by the addition of either dUDP (a nonhydrolyzable derivative) or dUMP (product of the enzymatic reaction) to the enzyme solution (Fig. 1, C and D). With the information provided by the three-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY spectra, together with the connectivity requirements of the polypeptide chain in the C terminus, an unequivocal assignment of the affected resonances was possible. The assigned segment corresponds to residues Gly149-Glu-Ala-Gly-Phe-Gly-Ser-Thr, located right after the strictly conserved arginine (Arg148) in the protein sequence. These residues comprise conserved motif 5 of dUTPases (13Prasad G.S. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2001; 2: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Other observed sharp peaks, as far as can be assessed from the analysis of the TOCSY spectra, may well correspond to the other residues in the N- and C-terminal segments of the molecule. The number of resonances assignable as glycines agrees well with that expected from the sequence. Other residues cannot be identified unambiguously, mainly because of the high number of alanine and proline residues in the N- and C-terminal segments, but the information obtainable from the spectral data is in good agreement with the sequence. For instance, the number of strips belonging clearly to U-type residues (Glu, Gln, and Lys) corresponds to the expected composition. The NMR spectroscopy experiments showed that among the flexible N- and C-terminal residues of Drosophila dUTPase, all residues belonging to conserved motif 5 are modulated by binding of dUMP, dUDP, or α,β-imino-dUTP. Complexation of the product or the di- or triphosphate analogues of the substrate dUTP with the Drosophila enzyme induced broadening of the sharp resonance peaks of motif 5 residues into the background of the folded protein globule. This broadening indicates that the conformational freedom of the residues affected is largely decreased because of binding of dUMP or the other nucleotide phosphates and that in the enzyme-nucleotide complex, motif 5 residues are in a folded conformation in the protein structure. Interestingly, the ordered conformation of motif 5 in Drosophila dUTPase is induced in the same fashion no matter whether the dUMP product or the α,β-imino-dUTP substrate analogue binds to the enzyme. This is in contrast to results reported for E. coli and retroviral dUTPases, where only binding of the triphosphate analogue could induce broadening of some NMR spectral peaks (7Nord J. Nyman P. Larsson G. Drakenberg T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition to the suggestions based on previous low resolution data (3Kovári J. Barabás O. Takács E. Békési A. Dubrovay Z. Pongrácz V. Zagyva I. Imre T. Szabó P. Vértessy B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17932-17944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the present NMR experiments provide clear and adequate experimental proof for the hypothesis that the closed enzyme conformer is present with high probability in the enzyme-product complex in the case of a eukaryotic dUTPase. In the closed enzyme conformer, crystal structure data indicate that motif 5 acts as a lid over the nucleotide ligand in the active site. Retention of this conformer in the enzyme-product complex, as shown by the present NMR data, prompts for a mechanism that allows product escape from under the lid. Nonindependent behavior of the three active sites in the homotrimer may provide such a mechanism where subunit communications can modulate active site conformation. Active Site Saturation in Drosophila dUTPase—Titration experiments were carried out to investigate this possibility. Intensity of all eight resonance peaks shown to broaden upon nucleotide binding, as well as intensity of several other resonance peaks, was followed by NMR spectroscopy along the stepwise titration of the enzyme with either dUMP, dUDP, or α,β-imino-dUTP. At the enzyme concentration of 1.75 mm used in these experiments, the apparent dissociation constants of the dUTPase-dUMP, dUTPase-dUDP, and dUTPase-α,β-imino-dUTP complexes (21, 5, and 0.5 μm, respectively; this last estimated based on the Michaelis constant for dUTP) (3Kovári J. Barabás O. Takács E. Békési A. Dubrovay Z. Pongrácz V. Zagyva I. Imre T. Szabó P. Vértessy B.G. J. Biol.

A linear relationship between the area under the resonance peaks and the concentration of the chemical species responsible for inducing the resonance peak was assumed. During the titration experiments, the intensity of all the eight decreasing peaks diminished to less than 10% at only 50% saturation. A representative titration curve is shown on Fig. 2 for the resonance peak of residue Ser155. This same behavior was observed during stepwise titration with either dUMP, dUDP, or α,β-iminodUTP for all eight disappearing peaks. The results suggest that in all the three titrations, partial saturation of the active sites already induces the completion of the conformational shift with regard to folding of motif 5 residues upon the protein globule. These results argue for some cooperativity in the homotrimer that is reflected in the NMR signals. Kinetic experiments provided an independent assessment of the suggested cooperative behavior. The substrate saturation curve of dUTPase with dUTP (Fig. 3) shows significant deviation from the hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Instead, a strong sigmoid character is evident. Experimental data fitted to the Hill equation (14Hill A.V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1910; 40: 4-7Google Scholar) resulted in estimation of a Hill coefficient of close to 3 that argues for a quite strong cooperative character in the homotrimer. Taken together, NMR titration experiments and the kinetic data both indicate a strong deviation from the model of independent active sites in the Drosophila dUTPase homotrimer. Such behavior has not yet been reported for any dUTPase. Instead, based on kinetic and nucleotide binding data, the absence of any cooperativity was ascertained in several references (15Larsson G. Nyman P.O. Kvassman J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24010-24016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Vertessy B.G. Persson R. Rosengren A.M. Zeppezauer M. Nyman P.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the previous study, ligand binding data as followed by circular dichroism difference signals could also be fitted to the simplest model. The information content of these data seems to be surpassed here by the highly sensitive NMR spectroscopic experiments. The physiological significance of the cooperative behavior observed in the Drosophila dUTPase homotrimer is not yet evaluated. We propose that this character increases the sensitivity of the enzyme toward regulatory mechanisms eventually required in the more developed organisms. Lack of such sensible character in the E. coli enzyme might be due to the fact that in pyrimidine metabolism of enterobacteria, dUTP is an obligate precursor for dTTP biosynthesis (17Nyman P.O. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2001; 2: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, dUMP is also available for dTTP biosynthesis as the product of dCMP deaminase. This enzyme is not present in enterobacteria that rely entirely on formation of the uracil ring from cytosine at the level of triphosphate nucleotides by dCTP deaminase. It is therefore probable that the increased dUTP load in E. coli requires the presence of a robust enzyme that can efficiently remove dUTP from the DNA polymerase route under varied cellular conditions. Multiple examples indicate that enzyme regulation in eukaryotes is more complex in many cases to enhance fine-tuning of cellular pathways (18Rath V.L. Lin K. Hwang P.K. Fletterick R.J. Structure. 1996; 4: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19Hudson J.W. Golding G.B. Crerar M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 700-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Peterson P.E. Smith T.J. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The difference in subunit interaction interfaces between prokaryotic and eukaryotic dUTPases may provide a structural reason for the observed absence or presence of cooperative character in E. coli and D. melanogaster enzymes. In addition to the observed decrease of motif 5-associated spectral peaks, the NMR titration experiments also showed that resonances from several side chains of the Drosophila-specific 28-residue-long C-terminal segment are characterized by a minor but significant increase in intensity induced by the dUDP or α,β-imino-dUTP binding to dUTPase. These resonances, however, do not change during titration of the enzyme with dUMP. Fig. 2 plots the data for a representative glycine from this region. These data indicate that binding of substrate to the dUTPase active site may induce conformational perturbations in the Drosophila-specific 28-residue-long C-terminal flexible extension, whereas product binding has no such effect. Structural Model for Motif 5 Conformation—The results from the multidimensional NMR spectroscopy showed that the conformation of motif 5 residues is closely similar in enzyme-dUMP and enzyme-α,β-imino-dUTP complexes. Modeling of these residues was attempted based on crystal structure data for dUTPase-ligand complexes, and the previously reported homology modeling of Drosophila dUTPase structure (1Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainer J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 2Fiser A. Vertessy B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Larsson G. Svensson L.A. Nyman P.O. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). The last two residues (Ser155 and Thr156) in the peptide segment that are modulated by nucleotide ligand binding to the enzyme could not be localized in the previous human crystal structure. We therefore simulated the possible conformation of these two residues by energy minimalization (22Tripos I. SYBYL. Tripos, St. Louis, MO1998Google Scholar). Analysis of the modeled structure revealed that the Gly152-Phe-Gly-Ser-Thr pentapeptide of motif 5 forms multiple interactions with the phosphate chain of α,β-imino-dUTP (Fig. 4B). The hydroxyl side chain groups of both Ser155 and Thr156 form hydrogen bonds to the oxygens of the α-phosphate group of the ligand. These interactions may well be determinant in the ordering of motif 5 even in the dUTPase-dUMP complex, because the α-phosphate oxygens in dUMP may also be expected to form the same hydrogen bond with the Ser155 and Thr156 side chain hydroxyl groups. In addition to side chain interactions, main chain carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen atoms also participate in hydrogen bonding to phosphate oxygens. Interactions between residues and main chain atoms of the Gly149-Thr156 octapeptide (e.g. an hydrogen bond network from Ser156 side chain oxygen through Gly152 main chain nitrogen to Gly151 carbonyl oxygen) contribute to the stabilization of the phosphate chain accommodating conformation of the C-terminal segment (Fig. 4B). The Gly149-Gly152 tetrapeptide also forms interactions with the surface of the neighboring protein subunit (not shown) that help in orienting the C-terminal segment toward the ligand phosphate chain. Based on the experimental results of ligand-induced cooperative conformational changes in Drosophila dUTPase, we propose the following scheme for the catalytic cycle (Fig. 4C). Binding of one molecule of substrate to the homotrimeric apoenzyme induces conformational changes in all the three active sites that will facilitate binding of further molecules of substrate. Cleavage of the scissile bond does not necessarily induce major conformational changes; the uracil, deoxyribose, and α-phosphate moieties of the substrate and the product experience the same binding environment before and after catalysis. The similar cooperative ordering of the C-terminal segment in the enzyme-dUTP or enzyme-dUMP complexes argue that a homotrimer partially saturated with either the substrate dUTP or the product dUMP may be equally primed for the binding of additional substrate molecules. The physiological relevance of this possibility is that within the cell, dUTPase may respond to both dUTP and dUMP concentrations and will be present in the catalytically competent conformation with a higher probability. An interesting hypothesis is put forward in this scheme, namely that product escape or product-substrate exchange in one of the active sites may be coupled to catalytic cleavage in the neighboring active sites. The lack of cooperative characteristics and product-induced ordering of the active site in the prokaryotic E. coli dUTPase (5Vertessy B.G. Larsson G. Persson T. Bergman A.C. Persson R. Nyman P.O.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) on the other hand suggest that the dUTPase homotrimer has acquired cooperativity during evolution. Conclusions—Multidimensional NMR spectroscopy is shown to be adequate to provide high resolution conformational characterization of flexible segments of a 60-kDa protein in the solution phase. In Drosophila dUTPase, this method reveals that motif 5 residues adopt the same ordered conformation in the enzyme-product complex as in the enzyme-α,β-imino-dUTP complex. The retention of the closed enzyme conformer within the enzyme-product complex is coupled to cooperativity within the eukaryotic dUTPase homotrimer.

The goal of this research was to study regulatory volume decrease (RVD) in bile duct cell clusters (BDCCs) from normal and cystic fibrosis (CF) mouse livers. Mouse BDCCs without an enclosed lumen were prepared as described (Cho, W. K. (2002) Am. J. Physiol. 283, G1320–G1327). The isotonic solution consisted of HEPES buffer with 40% of the NaCl replaced with isomolar amounts of sucrose, whereas hypotonic solution was the same as isotonic solution without sucrose. The cell volume changes were indirectly assessed by measuring cross-sectional area (CSA) changes of the BDCCs using quantitative videomicroscopy. Exposure to hypotonic solutions increased relative CSAs of normal BDCCs to 1.20 ± 0.01 (mean ± S.E., n = 50) in 10 min, followed by RVD to 1.07 ± 0.01 by 40 min. Hypotonic challenge in CF mouse BDCCs also increased relative CSA to 1.20 ± 0.01 (n = 53) in 10 min but without significant recovery. Coadministration of the K+-selective ionophore valinomycin restored RVD in CF mouse BDCCs, suggesting that the impaired RVD was likely from a defect in K+ conductance. Moreover, this valinomycin-induced RVD in CF mice was inhibited by 5-nitro-2′-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoate, indicating that it is not from nonspecific effects. Neither cAMP nor calcium agonists could reverse the impaired RVD seen in CF cholangiocytes. Our conclusion is that CF mouse cholangiocytes have defective RVD from an impaired K+ efflux pathway, which could not be reversed by cAMP nor calcium agonists.

Under physiological conditions, osmoregulation plays a crucial role in cholangiocytes, which are exposed to various osmotic stresses from the uptake of solutes and electrolytes and bile secretion (1Graf J.

Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1320-G1327Google Scholar), indicates that cholangiocytes can regulate their cell volumes back to base line from hypotonicity-induced swelling. As in other cell types, these adaptive mechanisms of regulatory volume decrease (RVD) in cholangiocytes are mediated by certain K+ and Cl– conductances (3Roman R.M. Wang Y. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G239-G248PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cho W.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1320-G1327Google Scholar). Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited multisystem disease in the Caucasian population and is caused by a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Many CF patients develop a spectrum of hepatobiliary diseases that are thought to be due to secretory dysfunctions from the CFTR Cl– channel defects. In recent years, CF liver diseases have become the second most common cause of mortality in CF patients as they live longer, but the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are not well understood. Recent immunocytochemical studies of the liver have shown that CFTR is expressed only on the bile duct epithelium but not on hepatocytes (5Cohn J.A. Strong T.V. Picciotto M.R. Nairn A.C. Collins F.S. Fitz J.G. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1857-1864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CFTR is one of the major Cl– channels mediating ion transport in the bile duct epithelium, but the direct role of CFTR in osmoregulation in cholangiocytes is not well known, although such defects in CFTR are likely to cause defects in osmoregulation. Thus, the purpose of the present study is to examine RVD in the cholangiocytes isolated from Ctfr–/– or CF mouse livers and compare it with RVD in normal cholangiocytes. To accomplish this purpose, we have used BDCCs, which are prepared by the same isolation method as mouse isolated bile duct units (IBDUs) reported recently by our laboratory (6Cho W.K. Mennone A. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G241-G246PubMed Google Scholar) but lack the enclosed lumen of IBDUs. These mouse cell preparations are primary cholangiocytes, and thus are considered to be closer to the physiologic state than other cholangiocyte cell lines and have proven to be quite powerful tools for studying cholangiocyte biology and physiology. The use of BDCCs can avoid likely problems with changes in luminal volumes with changes in osmotic solutions, and we have successfully used these BDCCs to study RVD in normal cholangiocytes (4Cho W.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1320-G1327Google Scholar). In the present study, we present compelling evidence that, unlike normal mouse BDCCs, those from Cftr–/– mouse livers have an impaired RVD as suspected from the defect in CFTR. Surprisingly, however, the impaired RVD in these CF BDCCs is mainly caused by defects in K+ conductances, rather than Cl– conductances, and is thus restored when K+ conductances are provided by valinomycin, a K+ ionophore. In addition, the observed RVD of CF BDCCs during administration of valinomycin is inhibited by NPPB, a general chloride channel blocker, indicating that the effects of valinomycin are not from nonspecific effects of valinomycin. In addition, these findings also indicate that there is a functioning non-CFTR chloride conductance pathway(s) present in CF cholangiocytes, which can mediate RVD in these cells. Materials—Bovine serum albumin, penicillin/streptomycin, EDTA, heparin, HEPES, d(+)-glucose, insulin, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), hyaluronidase, and deoxyribonuclease (DN-25) were purchased from Sigma. Matrigel was from Collaborative Biomedical (Bedford, MA), collagenase D was from Roche Applied Science, and Pronase was from Calbiochem. Liebowitz-15 (L-15), minimum essential medium, α-minimum essential medium, l-glutamine, gentamicin, and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen. Monoclonal anti-cytokeratin 19 antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. The CFTR antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Christopher Marino. All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Solutions—The compositions of the Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate and HEPES buffer solutions (containing (in mm) 135 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.25 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 MgSO4, 5 glucose, pH 7.4, 37 °C) have been described previously (7Alvaro D.

Investig. 1991; 87: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Isotonic and hypotonic solution compositions are as described previously (4Cho W.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1320-G1327Google Scholar). The isotonic solution was made by replacing 40% of the NaCl in the HEPES solution (pH 7.4 at 37 °C) with an equimolar amount of sucrose. The hypotonic solution was made the same as the isotonic solution but without sucrose. The actual osmolarities of the solutions used were determined by a vapor pressure osmometer 5500 (Wescor, Inc., Logan, UT). Isolation of Bile Duct Cell Cluster—The male Cftr–/– mice at age 4–14 weeks were obtained from Dr. Bev Koller at the University of North Carolina. Control normal male C57BL6 mice at the same ages were obtained from the Harlan Laboratory (Indianapolis, IN). These mice were housed and allowed free access to Colyte-supplemented water and Purina rodent chow (St. Louis, MO) to minimize complications of intestinal obstruction described previously (9Snouwaert J.N.

Animal care and studies were performed in compliance with institutional animal care and use committee guidelines. Mouse BDCCs were prepared as previously described (4Cho W.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1320-G1327Google Scholar, 6Cho W.K. Mennone A. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G241-G246PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were prepped and anesthetized, and their portal veins were perfused with Hanks' buffers with collagenase B; then the liver was harvested as described (4Cho W.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1320-G1327Google Scholar, 6Cho W.K. Mennone A. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G241-G246PubMed Google Scholar). The non-parenchymal tissue was obtained by removing the hepatic capsule and then mechanically dissociating hepatocytes. The non-parenchymal tissue was finely minced with scissors and then further digested serially by various enzymes including collagenase, DNase, and Pronase or hyaluronidase in modified minimum essential medium solution as described previously (4Cho W.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1320-G1327Google Scholar, 6Cho W.K. Mennone A. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G241-G246PubMed Google Scholar). After each serial enzymatic digestion step, fragments were filtered through 100- and 30-μm meshes (Tetko, Lancaster, NY), and those remaining on the 30-μm mesh were collected in 3–6 ml of modified α-minimum essential medium plating medium as described (4Cho W.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1320-G1327Google Scholar, 6Cho W.K. Mennone A. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G241-G246PubMed Google Scholar). Fragments were then plated on small coverslips (2–4 mm), coated with Matrigel (Collaborative Research) in 12-mm-diameter tissue culture wells (Corning), and incubated at 37 °C in an air/5% CO2-equilibrated incubator. Experiments were carried out 36–56 h after plating. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion in plated BDCCs at the end of the functional studies. Characterization of Mouse BDCC—Immunocytochemistry using cytokeratin-19 or CFTR antibody (6Cho W.K. Mennone A. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G241-G246PubMed Google Scholar, 8Strazzabosco M.

A. 1995; 92: 6527-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was performed in BDCCs 48–72 h after plating. Immunofluorescent images of the mouse BDCCs, immunostained with cytokeratin-19 or CFTR antibody, were obtained using an Olympus IX-70 inverted fluorescent microscope (Olympus America, Inc., Melville, NY) with a cooled charge-coupled device video camera (Hamamatsu Photonics Systems, Bridgewater, NJ) connected to a Power Mac computer with image analysis software (Improvision, Inc., Boston, MA). Quantitation of Regulatory Volume Response with Videomicroscopy— Applying the methods used for measuring a cross-sectional area (CSA) of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes (12Roberts S.K. Yano M. Ueno Y. Pham L. Alpini G. Agre P. LaRusso N.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13009-13013Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) as well as other cell types (13Mignen O. Le Gall C. Harvey B.J. Thomas S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 501-510Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we recently have shown and validated that the CSA measurements of mouse BDCCs obtained by quantitative videomicroscopy were highly correlated (linear correlation coefficient, r2 > 0.94) with the cell volume measurements by 3 independent methods: 1) sequential Nomarski light, 2) fluorescence microscopy of BDCCs loaded with BCECF and computer-assisted measurements of the corresponding CSA and volumes, and 3) laser-scanning confocal microscopy of intracellular fluorescent dye, BCECF-loaded BDCCs, and computer-assisted three-dimensional reconstruction and volume calculation (4Cho W.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1320-G1327Google Scholar). Thus, in the present study, the CSA measurements of BDCCs by quantitative videomicroscopy were used as indirect indices of cell volume measurements. BDCCs cultured overnight on Matrigel-coated glass coverslips were preincubated in isotonic solution for 10–20 min after being placed in a thermostated specimen chamber on a microscope stage. Coverslips were scanned for 5–10 min to select relatively spheroid BDCCs with sharp borders and without connections to other contiguous BDCCs and without any enclosed lumen. Videoimages of these BDCCs were obtained at 1–5-min intervals while maintaining the same focal plane at the maximum cross-sectional area. Osmoregulatory responses of BDCCs were determined by assessing the changes in CSA of BDCCs using an Olympus IX-70 (Olympus America) or a Leica DMIR (Leica Microsystems, Inc., Bannockburn, IL) inverted microscope with Nomarski optics equipped with a CCD video camera (Hamamatsu Photonics Systems) connected to a computer with OpenLab image analysis software (Improvision). Following a 10–20-min prestimulation period with isotonic HEPES buffer alone, BDCCs were exposed to a hypotonic HEPES buffer for 40 min with or without various inhibitors or chemicals dissolved in the solution. Each BDCC served as its own internal control, and changes in the cross-sectional area were expressed as a percentage of base-line values at time 0. The viability of each BDCC was assessed by the addition of trypan blue to the specimen chamber after each experiment. The BDCCs with positive trypan blue staining were excluded from data analysis. However, there was no significant change in viability, assessed by trypan blue staining, in experimental groups exposed to various inhibitors or chemicals compared with controls. Statistical Analysis—All data from videomicroscopic measurements are presented as the arithmetic mean ± S.E., and cell purity and viability are presented as the arithmetic mean ± S.D. Statistical differences were assessed by the unpaired or paired Student's t tests using the INSTAT statistical computer program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Characterizations of BDCCs—As with the BDCCs from normal mouse livers, BDCCs from Cftr–/– mouse livers formed spheroid clusters of cells with 24–48 h in culture (Fig. 1). Viability of the BDCCs was over 95% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion 24–72 h after culture. As with normal mouse BDCCs characterized previously (6Cho W.K. Mennone A. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G241-G246PubMed Google Scholar), these BDCCs from normal and CF mouse livers were identified as bile duct epithelial cells by positive immunocytochemistry using a cytokeratin-19 antibody, whereas negative controls with a secondary antibody alone were consistently negative for immunostaining. As expected, the BDCCs isolated from Cftr–/– mouse livers had no significant immunostaining with the CFTR antibody, compared with the negative controls, whereas BDCCs from normal mouse livers had a bright CFTR immunostaining (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Immunofluorescent micrograph of normal and CF mouse BDCCs. Normal and CF mouse BDCCs were immuofluorescently stained for CFTR. Whereas the normal mouse BDCC had bright immunofluorescent staining for CFTR (middle), the CF mouse BDCC (right) had no significant immunofluorescent staining compared with negative control (left).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Study of Regulatory Volume Decrease in Normal Mouse Cholangiocytes—The osmolarity of the isotonic solutions, measured by an osmometer, was 300.9 ± 4.5 mosm (n = 12, mean ± S.D.), and that of the hyposomolar solutions was 181.9 ± 3.6 mosm (n = 13). As shown in Fig. 1, BDCCs rapidly and significantly increased in size within the first 10 min of exposure to hypotonic solution. Exposing normal BDCCs to hypotonic HEPES solution from isotonic HEPES solution caused rapid increases in CSA as shown in Fig. 1, indicating swelling of the cholangiocytes. Measurements of cross-sectional areas using quantitative videomicroscopy showed that the relative CSA of normal BDCCs rapidly increased to 1.20 ± 0.01 (mean ± S.E.; n = 50) in 10 min after exposure to hypotonic HEPES solution (Fig. 3) and then gradually returned toward 1.07 ± 0.01 of initial CSA over the next 30 min. Previous work from our laboratory has confirmed that CSA measurements of BDCCs accurately (correlation coefficient r2 > 0.94) reflect their corresponding cell volume measurements using sequential phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy of BCECF-loaded BDCCs as well as by laser-scanning confocal microscopy followed by three-dimensional volume measurement analysis (4Cho W.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1320-G1327Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the previous studies on Mz-ChA-1 cells from human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines (3Roman R.M. Wang Y. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G239-G248PubMed Google Scholar) and normal BDCCs (4Cho W.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1320-G1327Google Scholar) that showed cholangiocytes exhibit intact regulatory volume decrease after exposure to a hypotonic solution. Study of Regulatory Volume Decrease in Cystic Fibrosis Mouse Cholangiocytes—To study the RVD of cholangiocytes in the absence of Cftr, BDCCs isolated from Cftr–/– mouse livers were subjected to the same hypotonic challenges. As shown in Fig. 1, exposure of the BDCCs from Cftr–/– mouse livers caused rapid swelling of cholangiocytes, indicated by a rapid increase in the relative CSA to 1.20 ± 0.01 of initial CSA (n = 53) in 10 min (Fig. 3). Compared with normal BDCCs, this swelling of cholangiocytes from Cftr–/– livers had a similar time course and magnitude of increase in CSA in the swelling phase. However, unlike in normal BDCCs, the relative CSA did not return to the initial CSA and remained at 1.16 ± 0.01 of initial CSA after 40 min in the hypotonic solution, indicating an impairment of RVD in CF mouse cholangiocytes (Fig. 3). Effect of Potassium Ionophore on RVD—Given the fact that RVD in normal cholangiocytes is dependent on both Cl– and K+ conductances, as shown by our study using normal freshly isolated mouse cholangiocytes (4Cho W.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1320-G1327Google Scholar) and others in the cholangiocarcinoma cell line (3Roman R.M. Wang Y. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G239-G248PubMed Google Scholar), this impaired RVD seen in CF mouse cholangiocytes can be from defects either in Cl– or K+ conductances. Although Cftr Cl– channels provide major Cl– conductances in cholangiocytes, previous electrophysiological studies have characterized a number of other non-Cftr Cl– channels present and functioning in cholangiocytes (14Fitz J.G. Basavappa S. McGill J. Melhus O. Cohn J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 15Cho W.K. Afdhal N.H. Diseases of the Gallbladder and Biliary Tract. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2000: 99-125Google Scholar). Therefore, we then studied the effect of valinomycin, a K+ ionophore, on RVD in Cftr–/– mouse cholangiocytes to examine whether providing K+ conductance can rectify the impaired RVD in these cells. Surprisingly, as shown in Fig. 4, an administration of 1 μm valinomycin completely restored the RVD in Cftr–/– mouse BDCCs, and relative CSA returned to 1.05 ± 0.01 (n = 35) (p < 0.01 compared with negative control) of initial CSA in 40 min, whereas the CSA of untreated BDCCs did not show a significant decrease. There was no significant change in cell viability with valinomycin administration. Furthermore, coadministration of valinomycin in normal mouse BDCCs during hypotonic challenge had no significant effect on RVD compared with controls (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Effect of valinomycin on RVD in normal mouse BDCCs.

As shown in Fig. 6, coadministration of 10 μm NPPB, in addition to 1 μm valinomycin, during hypotonic challenge completely inhibited RVD. These results indicate that the RVD seen with valinomycin is dependent on non-CFTR Cl– conductance(s), which is most likely a volume-activated chloride channel as shown by our recent study in normal cholangiocytes (4Cho W.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1320-G1327Google Scholar). Again, there was no significant change in viabilities of BDCCs, assessed by trypan blue staining, in any of these groups. Taken together, these results indicate that the limiting factor in the impaired RVD seen in Cftr–/– cholangiocytes is a defect not in Cl– conductances but in K+ conductances. Moreover, there are other Cl– conductances, which are functioning in Cftr–/– cholangiocytes even with known CFTR defect and can mediate RVD when K+ conductances are provided. Effect of cAMP Agonists on RVD in CF Cholangiocytes— Because stimulation of cAMP in certain cell types, such as non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells (16Civan M.M. Coca-Prados M. Peterson-Yantorno K. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 2876-2886PubMed Google Scholar), has been shown to enhance RVD, the effect of cAMP agonists on the impaired RVD in CF cholangiocytes was examined. As shown in Fig. 7, the administration of a cAMP agonist, isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) (1 mm), during the hypotonic challenge had no significant effect on the impaired RVD of BDCCs compared with that of the untreated controls. In addition, the effect of a more potent cAMP agonist, forskolin, on RVD of BDCCs was also studied. As shown in Fig. 8, the RVD of BDCCs treated with forskolin (10 μm) (n = 10) appeared to be slower in the initial phase of RVD when compared with that of untreated controls (n = 18), but there was no statistically significant difference between them. These findings indicate that, as previously shown in normal cholangiocytes (4Cho W.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1320-G1327Google Scholar), the stimulation of CF cholangiocytes with cAMP has no significant effect on the impaired RVD in CF cholangiocytes.Fig. 8Effect of forskolin on RVD of CF mouse BDCCs.

To examine whether an increase in intracellular calcium can rectify the impaired RVD in CF cholangiocytes, the effect of calcium agonists on the RVD in CF BDCCs was studied. As shown in Figs. 9 and 10, the administration of calcium agonists, thapsigargin (2 μm) or ionomycin (1 μm), respectively, during the hypotonic challenge had no significant effect on RVD in CF BDCCs. These findings indicate that unlike some other cell types, the stimulation of CF cholangiocytes with calcium agonists had no significant effect on the impaired RVD observed in CF cholangiocytes.Fig. 10Effect of ionomycin on RVD of CF mouse BDCCs.

Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1320-G1327Google Scholar, 6Cho W.K. Mennone A. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G241-G246PubMed Google Scholar). Although previously we have extensively used IBDUs with enclosed lumen for biliary secretion studies, in this study we have excluded those IBDUs and used only those bile duct cell clusters without lumen to simplify cell volume measurements without interference from changes in lumen volume with hypotonic challenge. These BDCCs are determined to be of biliary origin by positive immunocytochemistry using a cholangiocyte specific cytokeratin-19 antibody. In addition, the mouse BDCCs from normal mouse livers had a bright CFTR immunostaining, whereas the CF BDCCs had no significant immunostaining compared with negative controls (Fig. 2). Previous electron microscopic studies demonstrated that these cell clusters consisted of typical cholangiocytes, resembling previous morphologic descriptions of isolated rat cholangiocytes (27Benedetti A.

https://openalex.org/W2076289338,"The rapid transcriptional activation of cellular genes by either type 1 interferons (IFNalpha/beta) or type 2 interferon (IFNgamma) is responsible for many of the pleiotropic effects of these cytokines, including their antiviral, antigrowth, and immunomodulatory activities. Interferon-stimulated gene expression is mediated by transcription factors termed Stats, which upon being tyrosine-phosphorylated, translocate to the nucleus and bind enhancers of interferon-activated genes. We have recently characterized a new Jurkat cell variant, named H123, where IFNalpha stimulates programmed cell death. H123 clones that are resistant to the apoptotic actions of IFNalpha have been selected. One of these clones (Clone 8) is defective in its responses to IFNalpha with regard to activation of genes that require tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat2. Stimulation of Clone 8 cells with IFNalpha induces normal tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3. Sequencing of Stat2 RNA reveals a substitution of proline 630 located within the Src homology 2 domain of Stat2 to leucine (P630L). Pro-630 and its adjacent amino acids are conserved in all Stat family members but are absent in other proteins that contain Src homology 2 domains. Expression of Stat2 P630L in cells inhibits IFNalpha-stimulated gene expression. These results not only define a critical motif in Stat2 required for its transcriptional activity, but they also provide evidence that resistance to type one IFNs can be mediated by mutations in Stat2 as well as those previously described for Stat1."
