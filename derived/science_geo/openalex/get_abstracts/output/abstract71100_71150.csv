https://openalex.org/W1535350863,"Abstract A relatively fresh bovine plasma albumin (BPA) preparation (0.65 sulfhydryl group per albumin molecule; 5 to 6% dimer) and an old bovine mercaptalbumin (BMA) preparation (0.72 sulfhydryl group per albumin molecule; 8 to 9% dimer) were fractionated in a phosphate gradient on DEAE-Sephadex A-50. Two dimer fractions were obtained. One dimer fraction had a relatively high sulfhydryl content and could not be converted to monomer by treatment with thioglycolate. The other dimer fraction was essentially sulfhydryl-free, and approximately 50% of this dimer could be converted to monomer on treatment with thioglycolate. The first type of dimer predominated in the BPA preparation, while the second type of dimer was the major dimer component of the BMA preparation. BPA monomer fractions of varying sulfhydryl content were obtained. The first major fraction to be eluted was mercaptalbumin. Non-mercaptalbumin fractions were retarded in their elution from the column, and it was not possible to achieve more than partial regeneration of the sulfhydryl group of the more retarded non-mercaptalbumin fractions by treatment with 0.05 m thioglycolate. These results agree with the findings of Hartley, Peterson, and Sober and of Andersson. The BMA monomer fractions were similar in their elution volume and sulfhydryl content to the BPA fractions; as with the BPA non-mercaptalbumin fractions, the more retarded the albumin monomer fraction, the lower the sulfhydryl content after treatment with 0.05 m thioglycolate. The similarities in the behavior of the BPA and BMA non-mercaptalbumin monomer fractions are somewhat surprising since the presence of these non-mercaptalbumin fractions in plasma albumin has been shown to be due to mixed disulfide formation between mercaptalbumin and plasma cysteine and glutathione. It is difficult to see how the BMA non-mercaptalbumin monomer fractions could be present owing to such mixed disulfide formation, since the BMA preparation originally contained one sulfhydryl group per albumin molecule and has not since been in contact with small molecule thiols. Some oxidative pathway other than disulfide formation must be operative in the formation of non-mercaptalbumin monomer."

https://openalex.org/W1604618606,"Equilibrium chromatography of trypsinogen and trypsin was carried out on sulfoethyl Sephadex in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane chloride buffer under conditions which limit autodigestion. At least five active forms of trypsin could be resolved. In addition to the single chain form, a second active form was shown to arise during the activation process and to be abundant in all samples. This new form was found to contain an intrachain split between lysine-131 and serine-132, and to differ in esterase and amidase behavior from the classical, single chain form of trypsin."

https://openalex.org/W2021951883,"Antipyrine was administered to identical or monozygotic twins and to fraternal or dizygotic twins. Individuals with identical genotypes (monozygotic twins) exhibited significantly less variability in antipyrine halflife than did genetically different individuals (dizygotic twins). Therefore variations in antipyrine metabolism appear to be determined genetically rather than environmentally. In the 36 twins tested, antipyrine half-lives varied between 5.1 and 16.7 hours. No significant correlation occurred between half-lives for phenylbutazone and antipyrine in the 28 twins who received both drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1535028232,"Abstract The mechanism of myokinase (ATP-AMP phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.4.3) from rabbit muscle has been investigated by studies of equilibrium isotope exchange and initial velocities. The mechanism for the myokinase reaction is random bi bi. Under most conditions, equilibrium isotope exchange between AMP and ADP is faster than that between ATP and ADP. The rate-limiting steps in the reaction include the dissociations of AMP, ADP, and ATP from the enzyme. Myokinase has two binding sites, one for magnesium-chelated nucleotides and the other for unchelated nucleotides. Michaelis constants for the four reactants are presented. AMP and ADP can form inhibitory complexes of the dead end type. Adenosine 5'-monosulfate is a competitive inhibitor with respect to AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1622099522,"Abstract The localization, purification, and some enzymatic properties of choline acetyltransferase from rat brain were studied. Most assays were performed with a specific radiometric micromethod. Solubilization of the enzyme was examined after homogenization of cerebral cortices by means which disintegrate nerve endings. In isotonic KCl the enzyme was recovered in solution. In more dilute KCl the enzyme was adsorbed progressively but reversibly to particles, especially at low pH. The subcellular localizations of the enzyme and of acetylcholine formed from choline-14C in vivo were examined further after gentle homogenization of cortices. Subcellular fractions were prepared in density gradients and were sedimented in isotonic NaCl to desorb transferase from microsomes. From isotonic homogenates, 56% of the total enzyme and 60% of acetylcholine-14C were found in nerve endings. From hypotonic homogenates (in which nerve endings are lysed) the enzyme was recovered in solution, whereas 60% of the acetylcholine-14C was found with microsomes. 3H-Acetylcholine added to the homogenizing medium remained in solution. It is concluded that acetylcholine is synthesized in the cytoplasm and is then incorporated into synaptic vesicles. The enzyme was purified from whole brains to a specific activity (Vmax) of 0.727 µmole of product min-1 mg of protein-1 at 38°. The final preparation was free of deacylases, acetylcholinesterase, and carnitine acetyltransferase. By gel filtration the molecular weight of the enzyme was about 50,000; other studies indicated that the enzyme possesses essential —SH groups, that the protein is quite cationic, and that it is soluble in 0.1 mm buffers. Fifteen salts appeared to activate the soluble enzyme. Michaelis constants for the forward reaction were determined; each substrate reduced the affinity for the other substrate. The enzyme-catalyzed reaction was reversible with an apparent equilibrium constant of 514. It is possible that the amount of acetylcholine synthesized in the cytoplasm of nerve endings is regulated by mass action."

This fighting, comparable to fighting among normal male mice, suggests that early androgenic stimulation organizes neural structures mediating aggression in the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W1998134028,"Preference for ethyl alcohol was significantly reduced or totally abolished in rats given orally p-chlorophenylalanine, a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor that selectively depletes brain serotonin. Some aversion to alcohol was observed while p-chlorophenylalanine was administered, but the rats' rejection of alcohol was even more marked after the drug was discontinued. Oral administration of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor that depletes brain catecholamines, slightly reduced selection of alcohol, but preference returned to normal as soon as alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine was terminated."
https://openalex.org/W2078464297,"The proportion of female SJL/J mice exhibiting estrus when placed 2 meters downwind (6 meters per minute) from a group of 15 hybrid males was not significantly less than that of females placed directly under the males and exposed to their urine. The proportion of mice showing estrus when placed 2 meters upwind was significantly less than that of mice downwind or of mice below males, but not different from that of females remote from males. These findings show that the pheromone from male mice is volatile and further support the concept that it acts through olfactory receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1525638497,"Abstract Pig heart isocitrate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the TPN-dependent dehydrogenation of isocitrate as well as the decarboxylation of oxalosuccinate, is inactivated by treatment with iodoacetate at pH 5.5 and 30°. Approximately 1 mole of 14C-labeled reagent is incorporated per mole of protein. The effect of alkylation on the isocitrate dehydrogenase activity is greater than that on the oxalosuccinate decarboxylase activity of the enzyme, and therefore the active sites for these two catalytic functions are distinguishable. Inactivation can be prevented by the inclusion of isocitrate in the reaction mixture, suggesting that iodoacetate causes a specific modification in the functional region of the enzyme. Vmax for both the native and the partially modified enzyme depends on the unprotonated form of an ionizable group of pK 5.4, which shifts to pK 6.3 when measured in 20% ethanol as solvent. A requirement for the dissociable form of a carboxyl group is suggested. The Michaelis constants of partially alkylated enzymes are unchanged from those of the native enzyme. It is concluded that iodoacetate alters an amino acid residue essential for the dehydrogenase reaction. Iodoacetate treatment does not produce marked structural alterations in the enzyme, since no differences in molecular weight or in the ultraviolet absorption or optical rotatory dispersion spectra were detected. The pseudo-first order rate constant for inactivation of the enzyme by iodoacetate decreases from pH 7.8 to 7.2, is almost constant from pH 7.2 to 6.1, and increases markedly below pH 6.0. Enzyme alkylated at pH 5.6 exhibits the same sulfhydryl content as the native enzyme, and an unaltered histidine, lysine, and tyrosine composition. Amino acid analysis indicates that the methionine content of the alkylated enzyme is decreased by 1 residue as compared to the native enzyme, and a new peak, that of carboxymethylhomocysteine, is observed. Paper chromatography of proteolytic digests of 14C-labeled alkylated enzyme confirms the conclusion that alkylation of 1 methionine residue is responsible for the altered activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase. The rate of inactivation at pH 5.6 is independent of ionic strength. Modified enzyme exhibits a mobility identical with that of native enzyme in cellulose acetate electrophoresis from pH 6.2 to 9.5. These observations are consistent with attack of iodoacetate on an uncharged methionyl residue to yield dipolar carboxymethylmethionine sulfonium salt."

Their combined actions produce a rapid and complete dissolution of the zona pellucida, but the vitellus and its membrane are unaffected by prolonged exposure to this enzyme complex. Inhibition of the proteolytic component with lima bean or soybean inhibitors of trypsin prevents dissolution of the zona pellucida by the extract."

https://openalex.org/W1496620342,"Abstract 1. The amino-terminal peptide (1–24) of bovine serum albumin was subjected to carboxymethylation by 0.2 m bromoacetate at pH 6.8 in the presence of 0, 1, and 2 eq of copper(II) ion. The treatment with bromoacetate in the absence of copper(II) caused almost quantitative carboxymethylation of the imidazole groups of the 3 histidyl residues at positions 3, 9, and 18 in the sequences. In addition, the terminal α-amino group was apparently modified. Spectral measurements on the copper-containing complexes showed little or no effect on the copper chelation by the alkylation treatment. 2. Binding of 1 eq of copper(II) protects quantitatively the terminal α-amino group and histidyl residue 3, and appears to reduce somewhat the reactivity of histidyl residue 18. 3. Binding of 2 eq of copper(II) also protects the components of the preferred terminal site, but, in addition, both histidyl residues 9 and 18 are largely, and about equally, protected from alkylation. The binding of the 2nd eq therefore appears to involve both histidyl residues, in keeping with spectral and titration results. An intramolecular chelate structure or intermolecular chelates involving dimers or higher polymers are suggested. 4. The tetrapeptide l-aspartyl-l-threonyl-l-histidyl-l-lysine, which corresponds to the first 4 residues of peptide (1–24), was shown by titration, absorbance, and circular dichroism measurements to form an equimolar complex with copper(II) that has substantially the properties of the complex of peptide (1–24) containing 1 eq of copper(II) ion. Similar measurements on the equimolar complex of bovine serum albumin fill out a continuity that is especially evident from measurements of circular dichroism."
https://openalex.org/W2072514983,"Incidence of spontaneous aggression in adult male mice given a single injection of estradiol benzoate (0.4 milligram) when they were 3 days old was less than that of controls injected with oil. Aggressiveness was increased among adult females injected with either estradiol or testosterone propionate (1 milligram) at the same age. The increased aggressiveness noted among females given androgen was further documented during subsequent mating tests, when these females often attacked, wounded, and, in one case, killed naive males."

It was characterized by phenotypic changes due to a decrease of thyroxine, histological damage to the thyroid gland, and the presence in the seruim of antibodies to thyroglobulin. Susceptibility to the disease is genetically inherited. Hormonal bursectomy (androgen given to the embryo) suppresses the development of thyroiditis."
https://openalex.org/W1644959521,"Abstract A soluble enzyme complex, capable of catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of both α-ketoisocaproic and α-keto-β-methylvaleric acids, has been obtained from bovine liver. The purified activity (approximately 70-fold) has a pH optimum of about 7.6 for both substrates and exhibits Km values of 3.5 x 10-3 m and 2.5 x 10-3 m for α-ketoisocaproic and α-keto-β-methylvaleric acids, respectively. The enzyme preparation is highly substrate-specific, being most notably inactive with α-ketoisovalerate. Evidence is given for the separation of enzymes active with the latter acid from α-ketoisocaproate dehydrogenase, and the significance of this phenomenon relative to the genetic disease, branched chain ketoaciduria, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1891717208,"Abstract Initial rate and product inhibition studies of purified hexokinase II of ELD ascites tumor cells were made with the enzyme both free in solution and in complex with mitochondrial particles. In both forms the enzyme exhibits the random sequence of substrate addition that precedes the rate-limiting step. Inhibition patterns with AMP and ADP are similar in the two forms. Anhydroglucitol-6-P, which was a noncompetitive inhibitor with glucose, was competitive with respect to ATP with the soluble form of the enzyme only. When the enzyme was bound to mitochondria, the inhibition persisted at saturating ATP, suggesting that E·ADP is present in the steady state reaction with the bound enzyme form and that a dead-end complex is formed with anhydroglucitol-6-P. That such a condition could occur with the uncomplexed form of the enzyme was shown with a slow substrate, inosine triphosphate, in which anhydroglucitol-6-P was noncompetitive with respect to ITP. Detailed comparison indicates that the soluble enzyme is more sensitive to product inhibition at low ATP concentration and less sensitive at high ATP. The apparent affinity of all inhibitors and of ATP is decreased by the interaction of hexokinase II with glucose."

The alkenyl acyl phosphoglycerides produced were the type of plasmalogen most commonly present in mammalian tissues. Enzymes catalyzing this reaction are located in membrane fractions that also contain acyl transfer activity for other phospholipids. Acyl transfer rates with oleoyl-, linoleoyl-, and arachidonoyl-CoA were 13, 27, and 27 mµmoles per min per mg of protein, respectively, with the acyl analogue that forms lecithin, whereas they were"

https://openalex.org/W1548204630,"Abstract A microsomal preparation from chick embryo cartilage has been shown to catalyze the incorporation of sulfate-35S from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate-35S into microsomal glycosaminoglycan. This enzyme preparation is the same preparation that previously has been shown to catalyze the formation of chondroitin (nonsulfated) from sugar nucleotide precursors. The microsomal sulfate acceptor appears to be of high sulfate content and appears to be similar to chondroitin sulfate found in a supernatant preparation from chick embryo cartilage. The presence in the microsomal fraction of both sulfotransferase activity and glycosaminoglycanpolymerizing activity, as well as chondroitin sulfate, suggests that sulfation in the cell may take place in close proximity to the location of glycosaminoglycan polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W2058321965,"Temporary rainpools near Khartoum, Sudan, are inhabited by the notostracan crustacean Triops which completes its life cycle within 4 weeks. The annual rains fall in late summer, and throughout the winter and early summer the eggs of Triops remain in the dried mud or dust where they may be exposed to temperatures up to 80 degrees C. Laboratory experiments show that they can withstand temperatures up to within 1 degrees C of boiling, but are killed in partial vacuum by 70 degrees C, at atmospheric pressure by 100 degrees C, or under pressure by 105 degrees C. Exposure to high temperature seems to be necessary to break the egg diapause."
https://openalex.org/W1524619600,"Abstract Thyroxine and related compounds have been found to be excellent inhibitors of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase. The thyroid hormones appear to act by interfering with the normal coenzyme-binding mechanism. Triiodothyronine and thyroxine are uncompetitive inhibitors with regard to the coenzyme. In addition to inhibiting the enzyme activity, the thyroid hormone also quenches the enhanced fluorescence of the bound NADH and greatly reduces the magnitude of a Cotton effect in the optical rotatory dispersion spectrum which is attributed to bound coenzyme. Little effect on the over-all binding of the coenzymes was observed. However, the current findings are consistent with an inhibition scheme in which the thyroid hormones interfere with the binding of the nicotinamide portion of the coenzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1969934636,"IT has been suggested that a statistical distribution of entropy among a large number of entities will lead to a small percentage of them possessing a lower entropy than the mean value for the group as a whole1. To illustrate this point Campbell considered the example of the codfish laying a million eggs. This, however, is not a representative example of the entire biological world, for birds and mammals produce a very small number of eggs and the higher mammals produce only one egg at a time. Furthermore, if such a statistical distribution of entropy were possible in the biological world, a similar statistical distribution should also exist in non-living systems; and for every spontaneous reaction, a small number of products with decreased entropy should result. This is contrary to all known facts."
