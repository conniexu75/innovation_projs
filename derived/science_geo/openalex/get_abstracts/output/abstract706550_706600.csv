https://openalex.org/W4311359167,"The BQ and XBB subvariants of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron are now rapidly expanding, possibly due to altered antibody evasion properties deriving from their additional spike mutations. Here, we report that neutralization of BQ.1, BQ.1.1, XBB, and XBB.1 by sera from vaccinees and infected persons was markedly impaired, including sera from individuals boosted with a WA1/BA.5 bivalent mRNA vaccine. Titers against BQ and XBB subvariants were lower by 13- to 81-fold and 66- to 155-fold, respectively, far beyond what had been observed to date. Monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing the original Omicron variant were largely inactive against these new subvariants, and the responsible individual spike mutations were identified. These subvariants were found to have similar ACE2-binding affinities as their predecessors. Together, our findings indicate that BQ and XBB subvariants present serious threats to current COVID-19 vaccines, render inactive all authorized antibodies, and may have gained dominance in the population because of their advantage in evading antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W4311307047,"How SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the airway barrier of mucus and periciliary mucins to infect nasal epithelium remains unclear. Using primary nasal epithelial organoid cultures, we found that the virus attaches to motile cilia via the ACE2 receptor. SARS-CoV-2 traverses the mucus layer, using motile cilia as tracks to access the cell body. Depleting cilia blocks infection for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. SARS-CoV-2 progeny attach to airway microvilli 24 h post-infection and trigger formation of apically extended and highly branched microvilli that organize viral egress from the microvilli back into the mucus layer, supporting a model of virus dispersion throughout airway tissue via mucociliary transport. Phosphoproteomics and kinase inhibition reveal that microvillar remodeling is regulated by p21-activated kinases (PAK). Importantly, Omicron variants bind with higher affinity to motile cilia and show accelerated viral entry. Our work suggests that motile cilia, microvilli, and mucociliary-dependent mucus flow are critical for efficient virus replication in nasal epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W4313312704,"The diversity and complex organization of cells in the brain have hindered systematic characterization of age-related changes in its cellular and molecular architecture, limiting our ability to understand the mechanisms underlying its functional decline during aging. Here, we generated a high-resolution cell atlas of brain aging within the frontal cortex and striatum using spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics and quantified changes in gene expression and spatial organization of major cell types in these regions over the mouse lifespan. We observed substantially more pronounced changes in cell state, gene expression, and spatial organization of non-neuronal cells over neurons. Our data revealed molecular and spatial signatures of glial and immune cell activation during aging, particularly enriched in the subcortical white matter, and identified both similarities and notable differences in cell-activation patterns induced by aging and systemic inflammatory challenge. These results provide critical insights into age-related decline and inflammation in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W4313312395,"Abstract Daily experience suggests that we perceive distances near us linearly. However, the actual geometry of spatial representation in the brain is unknown. Here we report that neurons in the CA1 region of rat hippocampus that mediate spatial perception represent space according to a non-linear hyperbolic geometry. This geometry uses an exponential scale and yields greater positional information than a linear scale. We found that the size of the representation matches the optimal predictions for the number of CA1 neurons. The representations also dynamically expanded proportional to the logarithm of time that the animal spent exploring the environment, in correspondence with the maximal mutual information that can be received. The dynamic changes tracked even small variations due to changes in the running speed of the animal. These results demonstrate how neural circuits achieve efficient representations using dynamic hyperbolic geometry."
https://openalex.org/W4313270561,"Over the past decade, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have established their role as valuable agents in the treatment of various diseases ranging from cancers to infectious, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases. Reactive groups of the amino acids within these proteins make them susceptible to many kinds of chemical modifications during manufacturing, storage and in vivo circulation. Among these reactions, the oxidation of methionine residues to their sulfoxide form is a commonly observed chemical modification in mAbs. When the oxidized methionine is in the complementarity-determining region (CDR), this modification can affect antigen binding and thus abrogate biological activity. For these reasons, it is essential to identify oxidation liabilities during the antibody discovery and development phases. Here, we present an in silico method, based on protein modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, to predict the oxidation-liable residues in the variable region of therapeutic antibodies. Previous studies have used the 2-shell water coordination number descriptor (WCN) to identify methionine residues susceptible to oxidation. Although the WCN descriptor successfully predicted oxidation liabilities when the residue was solvent exposed, the method was much less accurate for partially buried methionine residues. Consequently, we introduce a new descriptor, WCN-OH, that improves the accuracy of prediction of methionine oxidation susceptibility by extending the theoretical framework of the water coordination number to incorporate the effects of polar amino acids side chains in close proximity to the methionine of interest."

https://openalex.org/W4313308087,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, which enforced social distancing and isolation, teachers were required to handle multiple challenges related to their work, including dealing with remote teaching, in addition to personal, medical and financial challenges. The goal of the current research was to examine factors that contributed to professional burnout and commitment to work among teachers during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.A total of 344 elementary school teachers in Israel completed online self-report questionnaires, including assessments of stressors, anxiety, resilience, self-efficacy beliefs, and coping strategies. Structured Equation Modeling [SEM] was used to examine the contribution of these factors to professional burnout and commitment.The gaps between needed and received support had a direct effect on teachers' burnout and commitment, and an indirect effect through anxiety and self-efficacy beliefs. Stress relating to remote teaching and support-gaps regarding remote teaching were the most significant of all the stressors and sources of support.Collectively, these findings highlight the significance of remote teaching as the main cause of stress and professional burnout and suggest that proper preparation of teachers-before and during times of crisis, may have a significant impact on their mental and professional well-being."
https://openalex.org/W4313410010,"Opioid overdoses within the United States continue to rise and have been negatively impacting the social and economic status of the country. In order to effectively allocate resources and identify policy solutions to reduce the number of overdoses, it is important to understand the geographical differences in opioid overdose rates and their causes. In this study, we utilized data on emergency department opioid overdose (EDOOD) visits to explore the county-level spatio-temporal distribution of opioid overdose rates within the state of Virginia and their association with aggregate socio-ecological factors. The analyses were performed using a combination of techniques including Moran’s I and multilevel modeling. Using data from 2016–2021, we found that Virginia counties had notable differences in their EDOOD visit rates with significant neighborhood-level associations: many counties in the southwestern region were consistently identified as the hotspots (areas with a higher concentration of EDOOD visits) whereas many counties in the northern region were consistently identified as the coldspots (areas with a lower concentration of EDOOD visits). In most Virginia counties, EDOOD visit rates declined from 2017 to 2018. In more recent years (since 2019), the visit rates showed an increasing trend. The multilevel modeling revealed that the change in clinical care factors (i.e., access to care and quality of care) and socio-economic factors (i.e., levels of education, employment, income, family and social support, and community safety) were significantly associated with the change in the EDOOD visit rates. The findings from this study have the potential to assist policymakers in proper resource planning thereby improving health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4312221361,"The small GTPase KRAS is frequently mutated in pancreatic cancer and its cooperation with the transcription factor MYC is essential for malignant transformation. The key to oncogenic KRAS and MYC working together is the stabilization of MYC expression due to KRAS activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, which phosphorylates MYC at serine 62 (Ser 62). This prevents the proteasomal degradation of MYC while enhancing its transcriptional activity. Here, we identify how this essential signaling connection between oncogenic KRAS and MYC expression is mediated by the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family member Survivin. This discovery stemmed from our finding that Survivin expression is downregulated upon treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with the KRASG12C inhibitor Sotorasib. We went on to show that oncogenic KRAS increases Survivin expression by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in pancreatic cancer cells and that treating the cells either with siRNAs targeting Survivin or with YM155, a small molecule that potently blocks Survivin expression, downregulates MYC and strongly inhibited their growth. We further determined that Survivin protects MYC from degradation by blocking autophagy, which then prevents cellular inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A from undergoing autophagic degradation. Cellular inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, by inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A, helps to maintain MYC phosphorylation at Ser 62, thereby ensuring its cooperation with oncogenic KRAS in driving cancer progression. Overall, these findings highlight a novel role for Survivin in mediating the cooperative actions of KRAS and MYC during malignant transformation and raise the possibility that targeting Survivin may offer therapeutic benefits against KRAS-driven cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4313254210,"Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) can suppress the activation, proliferation, and function of many T-cell subsets, protecting organisms from inflammatory and autoimmune disease caused by an overexuberant immune response. However, whether and how TGF-β1 regulates T-cell immunity in early vertebrates remain unknown. Here, using a Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) model, we investigated suppression of the T-cell response by TGF-β1 in teleost species. Tilapia encodes an evolutionarily conserved TGF-β1, the expression of which in lymphocytes is significantly induced during the immune response following Edwardsiella piscicida infection. Once activated, tilapia T cells increase TGF-β1 production, which in turn suppresses proinflammatory cytokine expression and inhibits T-cell activation. Notably, we found administration of TGF-β1 cripples the proliferation of tilapia T cells, reduces the potential capacity of Th1/2 differentiation, and impairs the cytotoxic function, rendering the fish more vulnerable to bacterial infection. Mechanistically, TGF-β1 initiates the TGF-βR/Smad signaling pathway and triggers the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2/3. Smad3 subsequently interacts with several transcriptional partners to repress transcription of cytokines IL-2 and IFN-γ but promote transcription of immune checkpoint regulator CTLA4 and transcription factor Foxp3. Furthermore, TGF-β1/Smad signaling further utilizes Foxp3 to achieve the cascade regulation of these T-cell genes. Taken together, our findings reveal a detailed mechanism by which TGF-β1 suppresses the T cell-based immunity in Nile tilapia and support the notion that TGF-β1 had already been employed to inhibit the T-cell response early in vertebrate evolution, thus providing novel insights into the evolution of the adaptive immune system."
https://openalex.org/W4313288827,"Introduction Metabolic syndrome is a group of metabolic risk factors which are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type2 diabetes. Nowadays, several studies have shown that the burden of metabolic syndrome is increasing among epileptic patients, and leads to MS-associated complications, including cardiovascular disease. However, getting published documents has been limited in Ethiopia and the study area. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the magnitude and associated factors of metabolic syndrome among epileptic patients in Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital in compression with respective controls. Methods Hospital-based comparative cross-sectional study design was implemented from June 25 to August 20, 2021. A total of 204 participants with an equal number of cases and controls (n = 102 each) were included. The data was collected through face-to-face interviews and biochemical analyses such as fasting blood glucose and lipid profiles were done through the enzymatic technique. The magnitude of metabolic syndrome was determined using both National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III and International Diabetes Federation definition criteria. The STATA version 14 was used for statistical data analysis, and a comparison of categorical and continuous variables was done with χ 2 and an independent t-test, respectively. The multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with metabolic syndrome, and variables having a P -value of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. Result The prevalence of metabolic syndrome among the epileptic group was (25.5% in National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III and 23.5% in International Diabetes Federation criteria), whereas it was 13.7% in National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III and 14.7% in International Diabetes Federation criteria among control groups. According to the International Diabetes Federation criteria, low physical activity (adjusted odds ratio = 4.73, 95% CI: 1.08–20.68), taking multiple antiepileptic drugs (adjusted odds ratio = 8.08, 95% CI: 1.52–42.74), having a total cholesterol level of ≥ 200 mg/dl (adjusted odds ratio = 5.81, 95%: 1.32–41.13) and body mass index (adjusted odds ratio = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.16–2.11) were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome among epileptic participants. Applying National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, taking multiple antiepileptic drugs (adjusted odds ratio = 6.81, 95% CI: 1.29–35.92), having a total cholesterol level &gt; 200 mg/dl (adjusted odds ratio = 7.37, 95% CI: 1.32–41.13) and body mass index (adjusted odds ratio = 1.53, 96% CI: 1.16–2.01) were also significantly associated. Conclusion The prevalence of metabolic syndrome among epileptic patients was higher than that of control groups and reaches statistically significant by National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. Being on multiple antiepileptic drugs, body mass index, having low physical activity and raised total cholesterol were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome among the epileptic group. Therefore, it is better to focus on controlling weight, having sufficient physical exercise, and regular monitoring of total cholesterol levels in epileptic patients."
https://openalex.org/W4313288955,"Dysfunction of the primary cilium, a microtubule-based signaling organelle, leads to genetic conditions called ciliopathies. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is mediated by the primary cilium in vertebrates and is therefore implicated in ciliopathies; however, it is not clear which immortal cell lines are the most appropriate for modeling pathway response in human disease; therefore, we systematically evaluated Hh in five commercially available, immortal mammalian cell lines: ARPE-19, HEK293T, hTERT RPE-1, NIH/3T3, and SH-SY5Y. Under proper conditions, all of the cell lines ciliated adequately for our subsequent experiments, except for SH-SY5Y which were excluded from further analysis. hTERT RPE-1 and NIH/3T3 cells relocalized Hh pathway components Smoothened (SMO) and GPR161 and upregulated Hh target genes in response to pathway stimulation. In contrast, pathway stimulation did not induce target gene expression in ARPE-19 and HEK293T cells, despite SMO and GPR161 relocalization. These data indicate that human hTERT RPE-1 cells and murine NIH/3T3 cells, but not ARPE-19 and HEK293T cells, are suitable for modeling the role of Hh signaling in ciliopathies."
https://openalex.org/W4313312980,"Data from gnomAD indicate that a missense mutation encoding the T118M variation in human peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) is found in roughly one of every 75 genomes of western European lineage (1:120 in the overall human population). It is unusual among PMP22 variants that cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease in that it is not 100% penetrant. Here, we conducted cellular and biophysical studies to determine why T118M PMP22 predisposes humans to CMT, but with only incomplete penetrance. We found that T118M PMP22 is prone to mistraffic but differs even from the WT protein in that increased expression levels do not result in a reduction in trafficking efficiency. Moreover, the T118M mutant exhibits a reduced tendency to form large intracellular aggregates relative to other disease mutants and even WT PMP22. NMR spectroscopy revealed that the structure and dynamics of T118M PMP22 resembled those of WT. These results show that the main consequence of T118M PMP22 in WT/T118M heterozygous individuals is a reduction in surface-trafficked PMP22, unaccompanied by formation of toxic intracellular aggregates. This explains the incomplete disease penetrance and the mild neuropathy observed for WT/T118M CMT cases. We also analyzed BioVU, a biobank linked to deidentified electronic medical records, and found a statistically robust association of the T118M mutation with the occurrence of long and/or repeated episodes of carpal tunnel syndrome. Collectively, our results illuminate the cellular effects of the T118M PMP22 variation leading to CMT disease and indicate a second disorder for which it is a risk factor."

https://openalex.org/W4313364201,"Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important source of edible oil and protein for human nutrition. The quality of peanut seed oil is mainly determined by the composition of fatty acids, especially the contents of oleic acid and linoleic acid. Improving the composition of fatty acids in the seed oil is one of the main objectives for peanut breeding globally. To uncover the genetic basis of fatty acids and broaden the genetic variation in future peanut breeding programs, this study used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify loci associated with target traits and developed diagnostic marker. The contents of eight fatty acid components of the Chinese peanut mini-core collection were measured under four environments. Using the phenotypic information and over one hundred thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), GWAS were conducted to investigate the genetics basis of fatty acids under multi-environments. Overall, 75 SNPs were identified significant trait associations with fatty acid components. Nineteen associations were repeatedly identified in multiple environments, and 13 loci were co-associated with two or three traits. Three stable major associated loci were identified, including two loci for oleic acid and linoleic acid on chromosome A09 [mean phenotypic variation explained (PVE): 38.5%, 10.35%] and one for stearic acid on B06 (mean PVE: 23%). According to functional annotations, 21 putative candidate genes related to fatty acid biosynthesis were found underlying the three associations. The allelic effect of SNP A09-114690064 showed that the base variation was highly correlated with the phenotypic variation of oleic acid and linoleic acid contents, and a cost-effective Kompetitive allele-Specific PCR (KASP) diagnostic marker was developed. Furthermore, the SNP A09-114690064 was found to change the cis-element CAAT (-) in the promoter of ahFAD2A to YACT (+), leading dozens of times higher expression level. The enhancer-like activity of ahFAD2A promoter was identified that was valuable for enriching the regulation mechanism of ahFAD2A. This study improved our understanding on the genetic architecture of fatty acid components in peanut, and the new effective diagnostic marker would be useful for marker-assisted selection of high-oleic peanut breeding."
https://openalex.org/W4313364477,"A perfluorocarbon (PFC) investigated for treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) delivers oxygen to support brain function, but causes transient thrombocytopenia. TBI can cause acute inflammation with resulting thrombocytopenia; an interaction between the PFC effects and TBI inflammation might exacerbate thrombocytopenia. Therefore, PFC effects on platelet (PLT) function and hemostasis in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model of inflammation in the baboon were studied. Animals were randomized to receive saline ±LPS, and ± one of two doses of PFC. PLT count, transmission electron microscopy, and microparticle populations were quantified at baseline (BL) and at 2, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours; hemostatic parameters for aggregometry and for blood clotting were measured at baseline (BL) and days 3 and 4. Injection of vehicle and LPS caused thrombocytopenia within hours; PFCs caused delayed thrombocytopenia beginning 48 hours post-infusion. LPS+PFC produced a more prolonged PLT decline and decreased clot strength. LPS+PFC increased ADP-stimulated aggregation, but PFC alone did not. Microparticle abundance was greatest in the LPS+PFC groups. LPS+PFC caused diffuse microvascular hemorrhage and death in 2 of 5 baboons in the low dose LPS-PFC group and 2 of 2 in the high dose LPS-PFC group. Necropsy and histology suggested death was caused by shock associated with hemorrhage in multiple organs. Abnormal morphology of platelets and red blood cells were notable for PFC inclusions. In summary, PFC infusion caused clinically significant thrombocytopenia and exacerbated LPS-induced platelet activation. The interaction between these effects resulted in decreased hemostatic capacity, diffuse bleeding, shock and death."
https://openalex.org/W4313409989,"The remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) based on cameras, a technology for extracting pulse wave from videos, has been proved to be an effective heart rate (HR) monitoring method and has great potential in many fields; such as health monitoring. However, the change of facial color intensity caused by cardiovascular activities is weak. Environmental illumination changes and subjects' facial movements will produce irregular noise in rPPG signals, resulting in distortion of heart rate pulse signals and affecting the accuracy of heart rate measurement. Given the irregular noises such as motion artifacts and illumination changes in rPPG signals, this paper proposed a new method named LA-SSA. It combines low-rank sparse matrix decomposition and autocorrelation function with singular spectrum analysis (SSA). The low-rank sparse matrix decomposition is employed to globally optimize the components of the rPPG signal obtained by SSA, and some irregular noise is removed. Then, the autocorrelation function is used to optimize the global optimization results locally. The periodic components related to the heartbeat signal are selected, and the denoised rPPG signal is obtained by weighted reconstruction with a singular value ratio. The experiment using UBFC-RPPG and PURE database is performed to assess the performance of the method proposed in this paper. The average absolute error was 1.37 bpm, the 95% confidence interval was -7.56 bpm to 6.45 bpm, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was 98%, superior to most existing video-based heart rate extraction methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method can estimate HR effectively."
https://openalex.org/W4312221278,"Nitrate is one of the major nitrogen sources for most plants. Chloride channel (CLC) proteins mediate the transport and vacuole storage of nitrate in plants, but the structural basis of nitrate transport by plant CLC proteins remains unknown. Here, we solved the cryo-EM structure of ATP-bound Arabidopsis thaliana CLCa (AtCLCa) at 2.8 Å resolution. Structural comparison between nitrate-selective AtCLCa and chloride-selective CLC-7 reveals key differences in the central anion-binding site. We observed that the central nitrate is shifted by ∼1.4 Å from chloride, which is likely caused by a weaker interaction between the anion and Pro160; the side chains of aromatic residues around the central binding site are rearranged to accommodate the larger nitrate. Additionally, we identified the ATP-binding pocket of AtCLCa to be located between the cytosolic cystathionine β-synthase domains and the N-terminus. The N-terminus may mediate the ATP inhibition of AtCLCa by interacting with both ATP and the pore-forming transmembrane helix. Together, our studies provide insights into the nitrate selectivity and ATP regulation of plant CLCs."

https://openalex.org/W4313271025,"The risk of type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease is higher in subjects with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of clinical conditions characterized by obesity, impaired glucose metabolism, hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Diuretics are frequently used to treat hypertension in these patients, however, their use has long been associated with poor metabolic outcomes which cannot be fully explained by their diuretic effects. Here, we show that mice lacking the diuretic-sensitive Na + K + 2Cl − cotransporter-1 Nkcc1 ( Slc12a2 ) in insulin-secreting β-cells of the pancreatic islet ( Nkcc1 βKO ) have reduced in vitro insulin responses to glucose. This is associated with islet hypoplasia at the expense of fewer and smaller β-cells. Remarkably, Nkcc1 βKO mice excessively gain weight and progressive metabolic syndrome when fed a standard chow diet ad libitum . This is characterized by impaired hepatic insulin receptor activation and altered lipid metabolism. Indeed, overweight Nkcc1 βKO but not lean mice had fasting and fed hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Notably, fasting hyperinsulinemia was detected earlier than hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and increased hepatic de novo gluconeogenesis. Therefore, our data provide evidence supporting the novel hypothesis that primary β-cell defects related to Nkcc1 -regulated intracellular Cl − homeostasis and β-cell growth can result in the development of metabolic syndrome shedding light into additional potential mechanisms whereby chronic diuretic use may have adverse effects on metabolic homeostasis in susceptible individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4313289432,"The current work presents the development of hybrid glass fiber reinforced polyester resin (GFRPs) composite. The composite integrates functionalized carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNTs) with glass fiber (GF) using polyester resin as a media. Hand lay-up method was adopted to prepare GFRPs samples in the form of rectangular sheets. Morphological characteristics of the GFRPs were investigated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), to analyze the f-MWCNTs distribution and agglomeration of the developed composite's surface due to varying concentrations from 0.0 to 0.5 wt.%. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were performed to confirm the presence of f-MWCNTs in the developed GFRPs. Sample with 0.4 wt. % f-MWCNTs showed the highest tensile strength and impact energy of 79 MPa, indicating a 31.66% improvement and 1.6 Nm with 77% improvement, respectively as compared to the control sample (0.wt.% f-MWCNT). The same sample also showed the thermal stability till 390 °C as measured through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Deposition of extra 10 layers initially increased the composite strength from 40 MPa to 128 MPa, however further increase in layers to 15 resulted decrease in strength to 100 MPa due to the poor interaction between the polyester resin and GF. The addition of f-MWCNTs in the composite effectively strengthens the interfacial bonding, which significantly improved the tensile and impact strength of the composite, making it tougher and thermally stable. However, further increase in the concentration of f-MWCNTs degraded the mechanical properties of developed composite such as compressive strength because of agglomeration of these nanoparticles and void formation in the composite."
https://openalex.org/W4313307962,"Antimicrobial resistance is an important global health challenge. The current study aimed to assess the level of awareness and knowledge of antimicrobial resistance and factors associated with knowledge among adults in Dessie City, Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 407 adults in Dessie City from June to July 2021. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select respondents, and Google Form was used to collect data online. The data was analyzed by SPSS Version 26. The associated factors of knowledge of antimicrobial resistance were identified by using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression. Independent variables with a P-value <0.2 were selected as candidate variables for multivariable logistic regression. Those variables with a P-value <0.05 were declared statistically significant factors.Out of the required sample sizes, four hundred and seven participants were enrolled, giving a response rate of 99.3%. One hundred and fifty-two (37.3%) respondents were females. Nearly one-third of the respondents (28.3%) have taken antibiotics in the last 6 months. In this study, 73.7% of study participants were aware of the existence of germs; 58.2% were aware of the existence of antibiotic resistance to bacteria; 47.7% were aware of the existence of drug resistance; 39.8% were aware of the existence of antimicrobial resistance; and 36.6% were aware of the existence of antibiotic resistance. Sixty-four (15.7%) respondents were not aware of any of the above terms. Sixty (14.7%) of the respondents were not aware of any risk factor for antimicrobial resistance. About 63 (15.5%) of the respondents did not know the consequences of antimicrobial resistance. Two hundred and thirty-eight (58.5%) respondents had good knowledge of antimicrobial resistance.

Being male, higher educational level, getting advice from health professionals about how to take antibiotics, using health professionals as a source of information on antibiotics, and taking antibiotics without a prescription were significantly associated with good knowledge of antimicrobial resistance. Educational campaigns would be highly desirable for the public to improve their awareness and knowledge of antimicrobial resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4313307992,"Habitat modification and introduced mammalian predators are linked to global species extinctions and declines, but their relative influences can be uncertain, often making conservation management difficult. Using landscape-scale models, we quantified the relative impacts of habitat modification and mammalian predation on the range contraction of a threatened New Zealand riverine duck. We combined 38 years of whio ( Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos ) observations with national-scale environmental data to predict relative likelihood of occurrence (RLO) under two scenarios using bootstrapped boosted regression trees (BRT). Our models used training data from contemporary environments to predict the potential contemporary whio distribution across New Zealand riverscapes in the absence of introduced mammalian predators. Then, using estimates of environments prior to human arrival, we used the same models to hindcast potential pre-human whio distribution prior to widespread land clearance. Comparing RLO differences between potential pre-human, potential contemporary and observed contemporary distributions allowed us to assess the relative impacts of the two main drivers of decline; habitat modification and mammalian predation. Whio have undergone widespread catastrophic declines most likely linked to mammalian predation, with smaller declines due to habitat modification (range contractions of 95% and 37%, respectively). We also identified areas of potential contemporary habitat outside their current range that would be suitable for whio conservation if mammalian predator control could be implemented. Our approach presents a practical technique for estimating the relative importance of global change drivers in species declines and extinctions, as well as providing valuable information to improve conservation planning."
https://openalex.org/W4313308088,"In France, the first pandemic peak fell disproportionately on the most disadvantaged, as they were overrepresented in contaminations and in developing severe forms of the virus. At that time, and especially during lockdown, the French healthcare system was severely disrupted and limited. The issue of social differences in the use of healthcare by people experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 arose. Based on a random sample of 135,000 persons, we selected respondents who reported Covid-19-like symptoms (cough, fever, dyspnea, anosmia and/or ageusia) during the first lockdown (n = 12,422). The aim of this study was to determine if the use of health care services was likely to contribute to widen Covid-19 social inequalities. Use of health care services was classified in three categories: (1) no consultation, (2) out-of-hospital consultation(s) and (3) in-hospital consultation(s). We estimated odds ratio of utilization of health care using multinomial regressions, adjusted on social factors (age, gender, class, ethno-racial status, social class, standard of living and education), contextual variables, health variables, and symptoms characteristics. Altogether, 37.8% of the individuals consulted a doctor for their symptoms; 32.1% outside hospital and 5.7% in hospital. Use of health care services was strongly associated with social position2: the most disadvantaged social groups and racially minoritized immigrants were more likely to use health care, particularly for in-hospital consultation(s). The highest utilization of health care were found among older adults (OR 9.51, 95%CI 5.02-18.0 compared to the youngest age group), the racially minoritized first-generation immigrants (OR 1.61, 95%CI 1.09-2.36 compared to the mainstream population), the poorest (OR 1.31, 95%CI 1.00-1.72) and the least educated (OR 2.20, 95%CI 1.44-3.38). To conclude, we found that the use of health care services counteracted the potential impact of social inequalities in exposure and infection to the Covid-19."
https://openalex.org/W4313316481,"With progressive urbanization and the development and utilization of urban underground space, underground urban complexes (UUCs) have been increasingly used. UUCs have brought much convenience to people's lives. However, due to their enclosed nature and complexity, it has been an urgent issue to avoid (or reduce) casualties and allow rapid and safe evacuation of people during an emergency. In this study, the evacuation simulation software Pathfinder was used. Based on the steering model, the variation of the total evacuation time and pedestrian flow at main exits with different simulated evacuation measures, congestion at key nodes and people's path selection were compared and analyzed. Then, the critical locations in the spatial layout of UUCs that were prone to evacuation bottleneck effects were focused on and determined. The evacuation effectiveness of UUCs in an emergency was studied to investigate the problems of emergency evacuation in UUCs. It is found that in UUCs, the bottleneck effects were likely to occur at stairway entrances and exits as well as supermarket checkout counters and caused severe congestion. These locations should be focused on during emergency evacuation. For key locations prone to evacuation bottlenecks, increasing the width of exits or setting up auxiliary evacuation channels could be an effective measure to improve evacuation efficiency. In addition, formulating rational evacuation rules can be a favorable measure for emergency evacuation. However, during the evacuation, the herd mentality in people has an uncertain (positive or negative) impact on evacuation effectiveness. Setting up diversion walls may improve evacuation efficiency and reduce congestion to a certain extent, while evacuation confusion and chaos are prone to occur after diversion. These findings in this study have significant implications for improving the emergency management of UUCs."

Prior work demonstrates that the tetraspanin, CD53/TSPAN25/MOX44, mediates B-cell development and lymphocyte migration to lymph nodes and is implicated in various inflammatory diseases. However, CD53 is also expressed in highly metabolic tissues, including adipose and liver; yet its function outside the lymphoid compartment is not defined. Here, we show that CD53 demarcates the nutritional and inflammatory status of hepatocytes. High-fat exposure and inflammatory stimuli induced CD53 in vivo in liver and isolated primary hepatocytes. In contrast, restricting hepatocyte glucose flux through hepatocyte glucose transporter 8 deletion or through trehalose treatment blocked CD53 induction in fat- and fructose-exposed contexts. Furthermore, germline CD53 deletion in vivo blocked Western diet–induced dyslipidemia and hepatic inflammatory transcriptomic activation. Surprisingly, metabolic protection in CD53 KO mice was more pronounced in the presence of an inciting inflammatory event. CD53 deletion attenuated tumor necrosis factor alpha–induced and fatty acid + lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine gene expression and hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation in isolated murine hepatocytes. In vivo, CD53 deletion in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis diet-fed mice blocked peripheral adipose accumulation and adipose inflammation, insulin tolerance, and liver lipid accumulation. We then defined a stabilized and trehalase-resistant trehalose polymer that blocks hepatocyte CD53 expression in basal and over-fed contexts. The data suggest that CD53 integrates inflammatory and metabolic signals in response to hepatocyte nutritional status and that CD53 blockade may provide a means by which to attenuate pathophysiology in diseases that integrate overnutrition and inflammation, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and type 2 diabetes.

The tetraspanins represent an expansive and diverse family of membrane-spanning receptors that mediate multiple processes across several cell types. These proteins have both intracellular and extracellular domains and act in concert as part of microdomains with other membrane surface proteins to regulate adhesion, migration, cellular fusion, proliferation, and signaling (1Kummer D.

Among this array of functions, some tetraspanins can mediate development and function, including inflammatory processes in lymphocytes (1Kummer D. Steinbacher T. Schwietzer M.F. Thölmann S. Ebnet K.

Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 3641-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). One member, CD53/MOX44/TSPAN25, is a tetraspanin that has incompletely characterized function (6Dunlock V.E. Tetraspanin CD53: an overlooked regulator of immune cell function.Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 2020; 209: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Prior data indicate that CD53 mediates B-cell development and for recirculation and homing of both B and T cells to lymph nodes (7Demaria M.C. Yeung L. Peeters R. Wee J.L. Mihaljcic M.

Immunol. 2020; 204: 58Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similarly, CD53 deficiency impaired neutrophil transmigration, thus CD53 likely plays an important role in the adaptive immune response (9Yeung L. Anderson J.M.L. Wee J.L. Demaria M.C. Finsterbusch M. Liu Y.S. et al.Leukocyte tetraspanin CD53 restrains α3 integrin mobilization and facilitates cytoskeletal remodeling and transmigration in mice.J. Immunol. 2020; 205: 521Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, CD53 is expressed across the lymphoid compartment and is thus likely to serve a broader immune function than the current literature suggests. For example, from a disease-specific point of view, CD53 is upregulated in atherosclerotic plaques and during coronary revascularization (10Duran J. Olavarría P.S. Mola M. Götzens V. Carballo J. Pelegrina E.M. et al.Genetic association study of coronary collateral circulation in patients with coronary artery disease using 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms corresponding to 10 genes involved in postischemic neovascularization.BMC Cardiovasc.

Genet. 2021; 11602908Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and is implicated in cancer surveillance and regulation of innate circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) levels in humans (13Bos S.D. Lakenberg N. van der Breggen R. Houwing-Duistermaat J.J. Kloppenburg M. de Craen A.J. et al.A genome-wide linkage scan reveals CD53 as an important regulator of innate TNF-alpha levels.Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2010; 18: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Accordingly, CD53 deficiency in humans predisposes to multiple recurrent infections (14Mollinedo F. Fontán G. Barasoain I. Lazo P.A. Recurrent infectious diseases in human CD53 deficiency.Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1997; 4: 229-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting broad immune participation for CD53. In addition, whereas CD53 is most highly expressed in the immune compartment, it is also expressed outside the immune compartment, including in highly metabolic peripheral tissues, such as liver and adipose tissues (15Uhlén M. Fagerberg L. Hallström B.M. Lindskog C. Oksvold P. Mardinoglu A. et al.Tissue-based map of the human proteome.Science. 2015; 3471260419Crossref PubMed Scopus (8161) Google Scholar). Moreover, the function of CD53 outside the immune compartment is not well understood (15Uhlén M. Fagerberg L. Hallström B.M. Lindskog C. Oksvold P. Mardinoglu A. et al.Tissue-based map of the human proteome.Science. 2015; 3471260419Crossref PubMed Scopus (8161) Google Scholar). Thus, potential CD53 functions in metabolic tissue remain unaddressed. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a disease of overnutrition in the liver, characterized by dysregulated fat accumulation. This is manifest on a spectrum that ranges from simple steatosis to frank lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (16Ferguson D. Finck B.N. Emerging therapeutic approaches for the treatment of NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2021; 17: 484-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide and is becoming the most common cause for liver transplantation in the United States (17Stepanova M. Rafiq N. Makhlouf H. Agrawal R. Kaur I.

Liver Dis. 2007; 11: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Beyond the liver, NAFLD and NASH are associated with development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality, making this both a common and morbid disease. Consistent with the fact that NAFLD stems in part from overnutrition, we and others have shown that mimicking the hepatocyte fasting–like response through glucose transport blockade induces compensatory adaptive processes that can be leveraged in contexts of overnutrition. These adaptations include activation of nitrogen catabolism and autophagic flux, activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, secretion of the antidiabetic, insulin-sensitizing hepatokine, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21 (20Harrison S.A.

CD53 expression in adipose tissue correlated to levels of hepatic steatosis, as quantified by hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels in a panel of mouse strains, and is associated with adipose tissue inflammation in previous studies of obesity (61Hui S.T.

Together, these data prompted the hypothesis that CD53 moderates both inflammatory and metabolic functions under duress to promote inflammatory metabolic diseases, such as insulin resistance, visceral adipose inflammation, and hepatic lipid accumulation. Here, we show that both inflammatory and nutritional stimuli induce hepatocyte CD53. We interdict this by inhibiting carbohydrate substrate uptake by hepatocytes by treating them with the glucose uptake inhibitor trehalose or by deleting the hepatocyte carbohydrate carrier, glucose transporter 8 (GLUT8) (34Mayer A.L.

We further show that CD53 cell-autonomously mediates TNFα and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) proinflammatory signaling in hepatocytes. In vivo, targeted germline CD53 deletion protected against Western diet (WD)–induced hepatic inflammatory gene expression, and NASH diet–induced peripheral fat, hepatic lipid accumulation, and insulin intolerance. We then identify a trehalose polymer, pTreA40, which induces hepatocyte fasting–like signaling via AMPK, FGF21, PGC1α, and Arg2 signaling (31Higgins C.B. Mayer A.L. Zhang Y. Franczyk M. Ballentine S.

We conclude that CD53 function assumes metabolic and inflammatory functions in hepatocytes under metabolic and proinflammatory duress. We first tested the effect of obesigenic and inflammatory diet (63Farrell G. Schattenberg J.M. Leclercq I. Yeh M.M. Goldin R.

About 16 weeks of WD feeding (Fig. 1A), 12-week high-transfat feeding (Fig. 1B), and 4-week methionine and choline-deficient diet feeding (Fig. 1C), each induced hepatic CD53 expression twofold to fourfold in mice. CD53 induction in the setting of proinflammatory overnutrition prompted us to test in isolated murine hepatocyte cultures if glucose transporter blockade and induced fasting-like responses also blocked CD53 expression. We treated isolated primary murine hepatocytes with LPS and with or without trehalose (24 h, 100 mM). LPS upregulated CD53 expression, and this was abrogated with concomitant trehalose treatment (Fig. 1D). One mechanistic target of trehalose is GLUT8 (34Mayer A.L. Higgins C.B. Heitmeier M.R.

Recent studies suggest that the high-salt/hyperosmotic environment in the body may alter the chronic properties of cancer and immune cells in the disease context. However, little is known about the acute metabolic changes in hyperosmotic stress. Here, we found that hyperosmotic stress for a few minutes induces Warburg-like metabolic remodeling in HeLa and Raw264.7 cells and suppresses fatty acid oxidation. Regarding Warburg-like remodeling, we determined that the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylation status was altered bidirectionally (high in hyperosmolarity and low in hypoosmolarity) to osmotic stress in isolated mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondria themselves have an acute osmosensing mechanism. Additionally, we demonstrate that Warburg-like remodeling is required for HeLa cells to maintain ATP levels and survive under hyperosmotic conditions. Collectively, our findings suggest that cells exhibit acute metabolic remodeling under osmotic stress via the regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylation by direct osmosensing within mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W4313253669,"Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) initiate signal transduction via the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by their tyrosine kinase activation known to determine cell growth, tissue differentiation, and apoptosis. Recently, many missense mutations have been reported for FGFR3, but we only know the functional effect for a handful of them. Some mutations result in aberrant FGFR3 signaling and are associated with various genetic disorders and oncogenic conditions. Here, we employed micropatterned surfaces to specifically enrich fluorophore-tagged FGFR3 (monomeric GFP [mGFP]-FGFR3) in certain areas of the plasma membrane of living cells. We quantified receptor activation via total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy of FGFR3 signaling at the cell membrane that captured the recruitment of the downstream signal transducer growth factor receptor-bound 2 (GRB2) tagged with mScarlet (GRB2-mScarlet) to FGFR3 micropatterns. With this system, we tested the activation of FGFR3 upon ligand addition (fgf1 and fgf2) for WT and four FGFR3 mutants associated with congenital disorders (G380R, Y373C, K650Q, and K650E). Our data showed that ligand addition increased GRB2 recruitment to WT FGFR3, with fgf1 having a stronger effect than fgf2. For all mutants, we found an increased basal receptor activity, and only for two of the four mutants (G380R and K650Q), activity was further increased upon ligand addition. Compared with previous reports, two mutant receptors (K650Q and K650E) had either an unexpectedly high or low activation state, respectively. This can be attributed to the different methodology, since micropatterning specifically captures signaling events at the plasma membrane. Collectively, our results provide further insight into the functional effects of mutations to FGFR3."

https://openalex.org/W4313270551,"Obesity is a serious health problem in modern society. Considering the fact that the outcomes of treatments targeting appetitive behavior are suboptimal, one potential reason proposed for these poor outcomes is that appetitive behavior is driven more by unconscious decision-making processes than by the conscious ones targeted by traditional behavioral treatments. In this study, we aimed to investigate both the conscious and unconscious decision-making processes related to eating behavior, and to examine whether an interaction related to eating behavior exists between conscious and unconscious neural processes. The study was conducted on healthy male volunteers who viewed pictures of food and non-food items presented both above and below the awareness threshold. The oscillatory brain activity affected by viewing the pictures was assessed by magnetoencephalography. A visual backward masking procedure was used to present the pictures out of awareness. Neural activity corresponding to the interactions between sessions (i.e., food or non-food) and conditions (i.e., visible or invisible) was observed in left Brodmann's areas 45 and 47 in the high-gamma (60-200 Hz) frequency range. The interactions were associated with eating behavior indices such as emotional eating and cognitive restraint, suggesting that conscious and unconscious neural processes are differently involved in eating behavior. These findings provide valuable clues for devising methods to assess conscious and unconscious appetite regulation in individuals with normal or abnormal eating behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4313270883,"Identification of small objects in fluorescence microscopy is a non-trivial task burdened by parameter-sensitive algorithms, for which there is a clear need for an approach that adapts dynamically to changing imaging conditions. Here, we introduce an adaptive object detection method that, given a microscopy image and an image level label, uses kurtosis-based matching of the distribution of the image differential to express operator intent in terms of recall or precision. We show how a theoretical upper bound of the statistical distance in feature space enables application of belief theory to obtain statistical support for each detected object, capturing those aspects of the image that support the label, and to what extent. We validate our method on 2 datasets: distinguishing sub-diffraction limit caveolae and scaffold by stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution microscopy; and detecting amyloid-β deposits in confocal microscopy retinal cross-sections of neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease donor tissue. Our results are consistent with biological ground truth and with previous subcellular object classification results, and add insight into more nuanced class transition dynamics. We illustrate the novel application of belief theory to object detection in heterogeneous microscopy datasets and the quantification of conflict of evidence in a joint belief function. By applying our method successfully to diffraction-limited confocal imaging of tissue sections and super-resolution microscopy of subcellular structures, we demonstrate multi-scale applicability."
https://openalex.org/W4313270897,"There is limited knowledge on the association between different health complaints and the development of persistent musculoskeletal pain in adolescents. The aims of this study were to assess whether specific health complaints, and an accumulation of health complaints, in the first year of upper-secondary school, were associated with persistent musculoskeletal pain 2 years later. We used data from a population-based cohort study (the Fit Futures Study in Norway), including 551 adolescents without persistent musculoskeletal pain at baseline. The outcome was persistent musculoskeletal pain (≥3 months) 2 years after inclusion. The following self-reported health complaints were investigated as individual exposures at baseline: asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic eczema, headache, abdominal pain and psychological distress. We also investigated the association between the accumulated number of self-reported health complaints and persistent musculoskeletal pain 2 years later. Logistic regression analyses estimated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). At the 2-year follow-up, 13.8% (95% CI [11.2-16.9]) reported persistent musculoskeletal pain. Baseline abdominal pain was associated with persistent musculoskeletal pain 2 years later (OR 2.33, 95% CI [1.29-4.19], p = 0.01). Our analyses showed no statistically significant associations between asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic eczema, headache or psychological distress and persistent musculoskeletal pain at the 2-year follow-up. For the accumulated number of health complaints, a higher odds of persistent musculoskeletal pain at the 2-year follow-up was observed for each additional health complaint at baseline (OR 1.33, 95% CI [1.07-1.66], p = 0.01). Health care providers might need to take preventive actions in adolescents with abdominal pain and in adolescents with an accumulation of health complaints to prevent development of persistent musculoskeletal pain. The potential multimorbidity perspective of adolescent musculoskeletal pain is an important topic for future research to understand the underlying patterns of persistent pain conditions in adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W4313270899,"Background High levels of loneliness are associated with negative health outcomes and there are several different types of interventions targeted at reducing feelings of loneliness. It is therefore important to accurately measure loneliness. A key unresolved debate in the conceptualisation and measurement of loneliness is whether it has a unidimensional or multidimensional structure. The aim of this study was to examine the dimensional structure of the widely used UCLA Loneliness Scale and establish whether this factorial structure is equivalent in men and women. Methods and sample Two online UK-based samples were recruited using Prolific. The participants in Study 1 were 492 adults, selected to be nationally representative by age and gender, whilst the participants in Study 2 were 290 older adults aged over 64. In both studies, participants completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale (Version 3) as part of a larger project. Results In both studies, the best fitting model was one with three factors corresponding to ‘Isolation,’ ‘Relational Connectedness,’ and ‘Collective Connectedness.’ A unidimensional single factor model was a substantially worse fit in both studies. In both studies, there were no meaningful differences between men and women in any of the three factors, suggesting measurement invariance across genders. Conclusion These results are consistent with previous research in supporting a multidimensional, three factor structure to the UCLA scale, rather than a unidimensional structure. Further, the measurement invariance across genders suggests that the UCLA scale can be used to compare levels of loneliness across men and women. Overall the results suggest that loneliness has different facets and thus future research should consider treating the UCLA loneliness scale as a multidimensional scale, or using other scales which are designed to measure the different aspects of loneliness."
https://openalex.org/W4313288806,"Background The debilitating effects of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and the accompanying chronic inflammation represent a significant obstacle for the sustainability of our development, with efforts spreading worldwide to counteract the diffusion of NCDs, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3). In fact, despite efforts of varied intensity in numerous directions (from innovations in biotechnology to lifestyle modifications), the incidence of NCDs remains pandemic. The present work wants to contribute to addressing this major concern, with a specific focus on the fragmentation of medical approaches, via an interdisciplinary analysis of the medical discourse , i.e. the heterogenous reporting that biomedical scientific literature uses to describe the anti-inflammatory therapeutic landscape in NCDs. The aim is to better capture the roots of this compartmentalization and the power relations existing among three segregated pharmacological , experimental and unstandardized biomedical approaches to ultimately empower collaboration beyond medical specialties and possibly tap into a more ample and effective reservoir of integrated therapeutic opportunities. Method Using rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as an exemplar disease, twenty-eight articles were manually translated into a nine-dimensional categorical variable of medical socio-anthropological relevance, relating in particular (but not only) to legitimacy , temporality and spatialization . This digitalized picture (9 x 28 table) of the medical discourse was further analyzed by simple automated learning approaches to identify differences and highlight commonalities among the biomedical categories. Results Interpretation of these results provides original insights, including suggestions to: empower scientific communication between unstandardized approaches and basic biology; promote the repurposing of non-pharmacological therapies to enhance robustness of experimental approaches; and align the spatial representation of diseases and therapies in pharmacology to effectively embrace the systemic approach promoted by modern personalized and preventive medicines. We hope this original work can expand and foster interdisciplinarity among public health stakeholders, ultimately contributing to the achievement of SDG3."
https://openalex.org/W4313288916,"Caldicellulosiruptor is a genus of thermophilic to hyper-thermophilic microorganisms that express and secrete an arsenal of enzymes degrading lignocellulosic biomasses into fermentable sugars. Because of this distinguished feature, strains of Caldicellulosiruptor have been considered as promising candidates for consolidated bioprocessing. Although a few Caldicellulosiruptor strains with industrially relevant characteristics have been isolated to date, it is apparent that further improvement of the strains is essential for industrial application. The earlier identification of the HaeIII-like restriction-modification system in C. bescii strain DSM 6725 has formed the basis for genetic methods with the aim to improve the strain's lignocellulolytic activity and ethanol production. In this study, a novel SfaNI-like restriction-modification system was identified in Caldicellulosiruptor sp. strain BluCon085, consisting of an endonuclease and two methyltransferases that recognize the reverse-complement sequences 5'-GATGC-3' and 5'-GCATC-3'. Methylation of the adenine in both sequences leads to an asymmetric methylation pattern in the genomic DNA of strain BluCon085. Proteins with high percentage of identity to the endonuclease and two methyltransferases were identified in the genomes of C. saccharolyticus strain DSM 8903, C. naganoensis strain DSM 8991, C. changbaiensis strain DSM 26941 and Caldicellulosiruptor sp. strain F32, suggesting that a similar restriction-modification system may be active also in these strains and respective species. We show that methylation of plasmid and linear DNA by the identified methyltransferases, obtained by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, is sufficient for successful transformation of Caldicellulosiruptor sp. strain DIB 104C. The genetic engineering toolbox developed in this study forms the basis for rational strain improvement of strain BluCon085, a derivative from strain DIB 104C with exceptionally high L-lactic acid production. The toolbox may also work for other species of the genus Caldicellulosiruptor that have so far not been genetically tractable."

Method Players were divided into an experimental group (n = 16) which was further subdivided into 1-day (n = 8) and 2-day (n = 8) per week training groups and a control group (n = 8). Results There were significant group-by-time interactions for 10-m sprint (p&lt;0.001, η 2 = 0.120, d = 2.05 [0.57 to 3.53]), 40-m sprint (p = 0.001, η 2 = 0.041, d = 1.09 [-0.23 to 2.4]) and COD (p = 0.002, η 2 = 0.063, d = 1.25 [-0.09 to 2.59). The experimental group demonstrated a ‘very large’ effect size (d = 3.02 [1.5 to 4.54]) in 10-m sprint, and ‘large’ effect sizes in 40-m sprint (d = 1.94 [0.98 to 2.90]) and COD (d = 1.84 [0.85 to 2.83). The control group showed no significant changes. There were no significant differences between the 1-day and 2-day training groups. In three of the four tests (40 m, COD, SLJ) the 2-day group demonstrated larger effect sizes. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were significantly lower in the 2-day group (p&lt;0.001, 3.46 [1.83 to 5.04). Conclusion The NHE increases fitness in youth soccer players and there may be advantages to spreading training over two days instead of one."

It is also the responsibility of the health facility to screen the contacts, identifying children for prophylactic therapy. However, the target is difficult to meet due to issues within health facilities that cause health system diagnostic delays. Despite this, there is no information explored why health system diagnostic delays among tuberculosis patients.A qualitative study was conducted by using different data collection methods and sources. Seventeen DOT providers, five laboratory professionals, six program managers, and seven Tuberculosis patients were interviewed. In addition, 22 governmental health facilities were observed for the availability of resources. Data obtained from the in-depth interviews was transcribed, coded, categorized, and thematized manually.Health system Diagnosis delays reasons were related with sample collection procedures, poor competency of health professionals, in addition to absences or scarcity of health professionals, medical products, and basic infrastructure. We found 18 health facilities without skilled personnel in the OPD, 7 health facilities with a broken microscope, and almost all health facilities without a separate room for sputum examination. Furthermore, 12 (54.5%) and 14 (63.6%) health facilities lacked access to water and electric power, respectively.Many reasons for TB diagnosis delays have been identified in the study area. Poor competence of health workers and scarcity of resources were identified. Depending on the finding, we suggest strengthening the health workers' training. Concrete strategies need to be designed to retain professionals. Training on human resource planning and budget preparation is needed for front-line managers. Managers have to work on the maintenance of diagnostic tools and facilitate transportation. The rural health facilities need to use another alternative power source."

Therefore, this study aimed to assess clinical anastomotic leakage and associated factors among patients who had intestinal anastomosis in Northwest referral Hospitals, Ethiopia.A retrospective cross-sectional study design was conducted among 411 randomly selected patients. The patient's medical records from February 2017 to February 2020 were used. The date range during which patients' medical records were extracted was from March 1 to June 2020. Patient medical record charts and data extraction sheets were used to collect the data. Data was entered into EPI-DATA version 3.1 and exported into SPSS version 25 for analysis. Binary and multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between dependent and independent variables. P-value of less than 0.05 and odds ratio with 95% CI were used to declare the presence of association.The response rate of the study was 99.8%. Of 411 patients, 38 (9.2%) patients developed clinical anastomotic leakage. Age group 0-10 years (AOR = 6.85 95% CI: 1.742-26.97), emergency presentation (AOR = 3.196 95% CI: 1.132-9.025), and pre-operative comorbid disease (AOR = 7.62 95% CI: 2.804-20.68) were significantly associated with anastomotic leak.Clinical anastomotic leakage is higher than the expected rate (4.9%-7.2%). Age, emergency presentation, and comorbidities were associated with clinical anastomotic leak. Hence, attention to early identification of risk factors and providing optimal pre-operative, operative, and post-operative care is necessary."

We find that the promulgation of Green Credit Guidelines significantly inhibited the market expansion strategy of high pollution enterprises. Two channels through which the Green Credit Guidelines affect the market expansion strategies of high polluters are increasing the cost of financing and promoting green R&D. Heterogeneity analysis finds that the impact of Green Credit Guidelines on the market expansion of highly polluting enterprises is more significant in non-state-owned enterprises and enterprises without equity incentive. Further analysis shows that the promulgation of Green Credit Guidelines damages the corporate image and profitability of high polluting enterprises, but it doesn't increase the risk of high polluting enterprises. The results of this research could help relevant government departments to formulate practical environmental regulations and promote sustainable economic development."
https://openalex.org/W4313365050,"Historic pollination networks are important to understand interactions between different plant and pollinator species, as well as to differentiate between causes and consequences of present insect population decline. Natural history collections in museums store biological proxy data, which is used to reconstruct historic pollination networks of bumble bees. Four bumble bee species ( Bombus terrestris , B . ruderatus , B . hortorum and B . subterraneus ) were introduced to Aotearoa New Zealand in 1885 specifically for pollination purposes. Pollen samples were collected from museum specimens of three of the four NZ species of bumble bee (excluding B . subterraneus ) collected between 1954 and 1972 from 56 locations across the South Island, New Zealand. The most common plants identified on all three bumble bee species were Calluna vulgaris (heather), Ulex (gorse), Cytisus (broom), and Trifolium repens (white clover). However, all three bumble bee species also carried pollen from several native plants (e.g. Arthropodium , Weinmannia , Plagianthus , Quintinia , Veronica , Melicytus ) and potentially had been involved in the pollination of these species. This study adds new plant species known to be foraged upon by bumble bees in Aotearoa New Zealand. Further studies on pollination networks in New Zealand will help us understand any changes in host plant preferences over time and after the time period covered by this study."
https://openalex.org/W4313365081,"Accurate measurement of cortical bone parameters may improve fracture risk assessment and help clinicians on the best treatment strategy. Patients at risk of fracture are currently detected using the current X-Ray gold standard DXA (Dual XRay Absorptiometry). Different alternatives, such as 3D X-Rays, Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) devices, have been proposed, the latter having advantages of being portable and sensitive to mechanical and geometrical properties. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the performance of a Bi-Directional Axial Transmission (BDAT) device used by trained operators in a clinical environment with older subjects. The device, positioned at one-third distal radius, provides two velocities: VFAS (first arriving signal) and VA0 (first anti-symmetrical guided mode). Moreover, two parameters are obtained from an inverse approach: Ct.Th (cortical thickness) and Ct.Po (cortical porosity), along with their ratio Ct.Po/Ct.Th. The areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was obtained using DXA at the femur and spine. One hundred and six patients (81 women, 25 men) from Marien Hospital and St. Anna Hospital (Herne, Germany) were included in this study. Age ranged from 41 to 95 years, while body mass index (BMI) ranged from 16 to 47 kg.m-2. Three groups were considered: 79 non-fractured patients (NF, 75±13years), 27 with non-traumatic fractures (F, 80±9years) including 14 patients with non-vertebral fractures (NVF, 84±7years). Weak to moderate significant Spearman correlations (R ranging from 0.23 to 0.53, p < 0.05) were found between ultrasound parameters and age, BMI. Using multivariate Partial Least Square discrimination analyses with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (PLS-LOOCV), we found the combination of VFAS and the ratio Ct.Po/Ct.Th to be predictive for all non traumatic fractures (F) with the odds ratio (OR) equals to 2.5 [1.6-3.4] and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) equal to 0.63 [0.62-0.65]. For the group NVF, combination of four parameters VA0. Ct.Th, Ct.Po and Ct.Po/Ct.Po, along with age provides a discrimination model with OR and AUC equals to 7.5 [6.0-9.1] and 0.75 [0.73-0.76]. When restricted to a smaller population (87 patients) common to both BDAT and DXA, BDAT ORs and AUCs are comparable or slightly higher to values obtained with DXA. The fracture risk assessment by BDAT method in older patients, in a clinical setting, suggests the benefit of the affordable and transportable device for the routine use."
https://openalex.org/W4313410028,"Gait asymmetry is a common symptom in groups with neurological disorders and significantly reduces gait efficiency. To develop efficient training for gait rehabilitation, we propose a novel gait rehabilitation paradigm that combines two distinct perturbation strategies: visual feedback distortion (VFD) and split-belt treadmill (SBT) walking. In SBT walking, spatiotemporal gait adaptation can be readily achieved, but it quickly fades after training. Gait adaptation to implicit VFD in an unconscious manner tends to persist longer, potentially due to a greater engagement of implicit learning during training. Thus, we investigated whether the combined strategies would lead to more effective changes in symmetric gait patterns with longer retention periods. We compared the retention of the preserved asymmetric pattern acquired by “implicit VFD+SBT walking” with “SBT-only walking” and with “SBT walking with conscious correction”. In the implicit VFD+SBT walking, the speed of the two belts was gradually changed, the visual representation of gait symmetry was implicitly distorted, and no instructions were given to subjects except to watch the visual feedback. In the SBT walking with conscious correction, subjects were instructed to consciously correct their steps with the help of visual feedback while SBT walking. The SBT-only walking consisted of SBT walking with no visual feedback. After the 7-minute adaptation period, we removed the visual feedback and the split-belt perturbations, and we assessed the retention of the preserved asymmetric pattern while subjects continued walking for the 15-minute post-adaptation period. In a group of subjects who spontaneously showed visuomotor adaptation in response to the implicit VFD (16 out of 27 subjects), we found a greater retention rate during the implicit VFD+SBT walking trial than the SBT-only walking or the SBT walking with conscious correction trials. The implicit visual distortion paradigm delivered in an attention-independent (unconscious) manner can be utilized and integrated into SBT walking to improve the efficacy of symmetric gait adaptation by producing longer-lasting effects on the retention of a newly learned motor pattern."
