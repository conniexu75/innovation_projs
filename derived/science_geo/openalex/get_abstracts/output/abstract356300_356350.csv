https://openalex.org/W1985339653,"Recently, two novel concepts have emerged in cancer biology: the role of so-called “cancer stem cells” in tumor initiation, and the involvement of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the metastatic dissemination of epithelial cancer cells. Using a mammary tumor progression model, we show that cells possessing both stem and tumorigenic characteristics of “cancer stem cells” can be derived from human mammary epithelial cells following the activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. The acquisition of these stem and tumorigenic characters is driven by EMT induction."

https://openalex.org/W2016527243,"In cold dark matter cosmological models, structures form and grow through the merging of smaller units. Numerical simulations have shown that such merging is incomplete; the inner cores of haloes survive and orbit as 'subhaloes' within their hosts. Here we report a simulation that resolves such substructure even in the very inner regions of the Galactic halo. We find hundreds of very concentrated dark matter clumps surviving near the solar circle, as well as numerous cold streams. The simulation also reveals the fractal nature of dark matter clustering: isolated haloes and subhaloes contain the same relative amount of substructure and both have cusped inner density profiles. The inner mass and phase-space densities of subhaloes match those of recently discovered faint, dark-matter-dominated dwarf satellite galaxies, and the overall amount of substructure can explain the anomalous flux ratios seen in strong gravitational lenses. Subhaloes boost gamma-ray production from dark matter annihilation by factors of 4 to 15 relative to smooth galactic models. Local cosmic ray production is also enhanced, typically by a factor of 1.4 but by a factor of more than 10 in one per cent of locations lying sufficiently close to a large subhalo. (These estimates assume that the gravitational effects of baryons on dark matter substructure are small.)."
https://openalex.org/W2005949970,"Ultracold atomic gases provide model systems in which to study many-body quantum physics. Recent experiments using Fermi gases have demonstrated a phase transition to a superfluid state with strong interparticle interactions. This system provides a realization of the 'BCS-BEC crossover' connecting the physics of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductivity with that of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Although many aspects of this system have been investigated, it has not yet been possible to measure the single-particle excitation spectrum (a fundamental property directly predicted by many-body theories). Here we use photoemission spectroscopy to directly probe the elementary excitations and energy dispersion in a strongly interacting Fermi gas of (40)K atoms. In the experiments, a radio-frequency photon ejects an atom from the strongly interacting system by means of a spin-flip transition to a weakly interacting state. We measure the occupied density of single-particle states at the cusp of the BCS-BEC crossover and on the BEC side of the crossover, and compare these results to that for a nearly ideal Fermi gas. We show that, near the critical temperature, the single-particle spectral function is dramatically altered in a way that is consistent with a large pairing gap. Our results probe the many-body physics in a way that could be compared to data for the high-transition-temperature superconductors. As in photoemission spectroscopy for electronic materials, our measurement technique for ultracold atomic gases directly probes low-energy excitations and thus can reveal excitation gaps and/or pseudogaps. Furthermore, this technique can provide an analogue of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy for probing anisotropic systems, such as atoms in optical lattice potentials."
https://openalex.org/W2133831062,"Potato is the world's fourth largest food crop yet it continues to endure late blight, a devastating disease caused by the Irish famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans. Breeding broad-spectrum disease resistance (R) genes into potato (Solanum tuberosum) is the best strategy for genetically managing late blight but current approaches are slow and inefficient. We used a repertoire of effector genes predicted computationally from the P. infestans genome to accelerate the identification, functional characterization, and cloning of potentially broad-spectrum R genes. An initial set of 54 effectors containing a signal peptide and a RXLR motif was profiled for activation of innate immunity (avirulence or Avr activity) on wild Solanum species and tentative Avr candidates were identified. The RXLR effector family IpiO induced hypersensitive responses (HR) in S. stoloniferum, S. papita and the more distantly related S. bulbocastanum, the source of the R gene Rpi-blb1. Genetic studies with S. stoloniferum showed cosegregation of resistance to P. infestans and response to IpiO. Transient co-expression of IpiO with Rpi-blb1 in a heterologous Nicotiana benthamiana system identified IpiO as Avr-blb1. A candidate gene approach led to the rapid cloning of S. stoloniferum Rpi-sto1 and S. papita Rpi-pta1, which are functionally equivalent to Rpi-blb1. Our findings indicate that effector genomics enables discovery and functional profiling of late blight R genes and Avr genes at an unprecedented rate and promises to accelerate the engineering of late blight resistant potato varieties."

We present an algorithm which is mathematically sound and computationally efficient to accurately analyze CNV in a DNA sample utilizing a nanofluidic device, known as the digital array.

We also provide formulas which can be used as close approximations."
https://openalex.org/W1998949529,"Fsp27, a member of the Cide family proteins, was shown to localize to lipid droplet and promote lipid storage in adipocytes. We aimed to understand the biological role of Fsp27 in regulating adipose tissue differentiation, insulin sensitivity and energy balance. Fsp27(-/-) mice and Fsp27/lep double deficient mice were generated and we examined the adiposity, whole body metabolism, BAT and WAT morphology, insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial activity, and gene expression changes in these mouse strains. Furthermore, we isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wildtype and Fsp27(-/-) mice, followed by their differentiation into adipocytes in vitro. We found that Fsp27 is expressed in both brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) and its levels were significantly elevated in the WAT and liver of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Fsp27(-/-) mice had increased energy expenditure, lower levels of plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids. Furthermore, Fsp27(-/-)and Fsp27/lep double-deficient mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity and display increased insulin sensitivity. Moreover, white adipocytes in Fsp27(-/-) mice have reduced triglycerides accumulation and smaller lipid droplets, while levels of mitochondrial proteins, mitochondrial size and activity are dramatically increased. We further demonstrated that BAT-specific genes and key metabolic controlling factors such as FoxC2, PPAR and PGC1alpha were all markedly upregulated. In contrast, factors inhibiting BAT differentiation such as Rb, p107 and RIP140 were down-regulated in the WAT of Fsp27(-/-) mice. Remarkably, Fsp27(-/-) MEFs differentiated in vitro show many brown adipocyte characteristics in the presence of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3). Our data thus suggest that Fsp27 acts as a novel regulator in vivo to control WAT identity, mitochondrial activity and insulin sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1994712122,"Background There is strong evidence that culture-based methods detect only a small proportion of bacteria present in the respiratory tracts of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Methodology/Principal Findings Standard microbiological culture and phenotypic identification of bacteria in sputa from CF patients have been compared to molecular methods by the use of 16S rDNA amplification, cloning and sequencing. Twenty-five sputa from CF patients were cultured that yield 33 isolates (13 species) known to be pathogens during CF. For molecular cloning, 760 clones were sequenced (7.2±3.9 species/sputum), and 53 different bacterial species were identified including 16 species of anaerobes (30%). Discrepancies between culture and molecular data were numerous and demonstrate that accurate identification remains challenging. New or emerging bacteria not or rarely reported in CF patients were detected including Dolosigranulum pigrum, Dialister pneumosintes, and Inquilinus limosus. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate the complex microbial community in sputa from CF patients, especially anaerobic bacteria that are probably an underestimated cause of CF lung pathology. Metagenomic analysis is urgently needed to better understand those complex communities in CF pulmonary infections."
https://openalex.org/W2124959222,"Background Pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells, which have the capacity to give rise to all tissue types in the body, show great promise as a versatile source of cells for regenerative therapy. However, the basic mechanisms of lineage specification of pluripotent stem cells are largely unknown, and generating sufficient quantities of desired cell types remains a formidable challenge. Small molecules, particularly those that modulate key developmental pathways like the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling cascade, hold promise as tools to study in vitro lineage specification and to direct differentiation of stem cells toward particular cell types. Methodology/ Principal Findings We describe the use of dorsomorphin, a selective small molecule inhibitor of BMP signaling, to induce myocardial differentiation in mouse ES cells. Cardiac induction is very robust, increasing the yield of spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes by at least 20 fold. Dorsomorphin, unlike the endogenous BMP antagonist Noggin, robustly induces cardiomyogenesis when treatment is limited to the initial 24-hours of ES cell differentiation. Quantitative-PCR analyses of differentiating ES cells indicate that pharmacological inhibition of BMP signaling during the early critical stage promotes the development of the cardiomyocyte lineage, but reduces the differentiation of endothelial, smooth muscle, and hematopoietic cells. Conclusions/ Significance Administration of a selective small molecule BMP inhibitor during the initial stages of ES cell differentiation substantially promotes the differentiation of primitive pluripotent cells toward the cardiomyocytic lineage, apparently at the expense of other mesodermal lineages. Small molecule modulators of developmental pathways like dorsomorphin could become versatile pharmacological tools for stem cell research and regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2098200075,"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by congenital malformation of the great toes and by progressive heterotopic bone formation in muscle tissue. Recently, a mutation involving a single amino acid substitution in a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor, ALK2, was identified in patients with FOP. We report here that the identical mutation, R206H, was observed in 19 Japanese patients with sporadic FOP. This mutant receptor, ALK2(R206H), activates BMP signaling without ligand binding. Moreover, expression of Smad1 and Smad5 was up-regulated in response to muscular injury. ALK2(R206H) with Smad1 or Smad5 induced osteoblastic differentiation that could be inhibited by Smad7 or dorsomorphin. Taken together, these findings suggest that the heterotopic bone formation in FOP may be induced by a constitutively activated BMP receptor signaling through Smad1 or Smad5. Gene transfer of Smad7 or inhibition of type I receptors with dorsomorphin may represent strategies for blocking the activity induced by ALK2(R206H) in FOP.

At birth, most patients with FOP have malformations of the great toes, with hallux valgus, but do not have significant ectopic ossification. Heterotopic bone formation in the muscles and other soft tissues begins in early childhood and is further exacerbated by trauma, surgical treatment, lesional biopsies, and intramuscular injection (4Kaplan F.S.

Ectopic bone formation similar to that observed in FOP is induced by implantation of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) into muscle tissue (6Urist M.R.

BMPs are members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily that were originally isolated from demineralized bone matrix and identified as factors responsible for induction of bone formation (6Urist M.R.

BMP signaling is transduced by two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, termed type I and type II receptors (9Miyazono K. Maeda S. Imamura T.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2008: 121-149Google Scholar). The ligand-bound type II receptor activates type I receptor kinase through phosphorylation of the glycine-serine (GS) domain, which is highly conserved among type I BMP and TGF-β receptors. ACVR1/ALK2, BMPR-IA/ALK3, BMPR-IB/ALK6, and ALK1 function as BMP type I receptors. Activated BMP type I receptor kinase activity in turn phosphorylates receptor regulated Smads, including Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8. Phosphorylated regulated Smads form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus to regulate transcription of various target genes, including ID1, which encodes an inhibitor of myogenesis (10Katagiri T.

I-Smads inhibit the BMP signaling pathways and thus form a negative feedback loop that down-regulates BMP signaling (14Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K.

Recently, a recurrent heterozygous mutation in the ACVR1/ALK2 gene was identified at 617G→A in both familial and sporadic patients with FOP (21Shore E.M. Xu M. Feldman G.J. Fenstermacher D.A. Cho T.J. Choi I.H. Connor J.M. Delai P. Glaser D.L. LeMerrer M. Morhart R. Rogers J.G. Smith R. Triffitt J.T. Urtizberea J.A. Zasloff M. Brown M.A. Kaplan F.S. Nat.

Genet. 2007; 52: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This mutation causes an amino acid substitution of Arg to His at codon 206 (R206H) within the GS domain of the ALK2 receptor (21Shore E.M. Xu M. Feldman G.J. Fenstermacher D.A. Cho T.J. Choi I.H.

Genet. 2006; 38: 525-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Although a conformational change in the GS domain leading to activation of the receptor has been suggested to occur, the functional changes of the mutant receptor are still unclear. In this study, we report that the common ALK2(R206H) mutation was identified in 19 of 19 Japanese patients with sporadic FOP and determined that ALK2(R206H) constitutively activates BMP signaling in in vitro assays. Expression of ALK2(R206H) in C2C12 myoblasts induced osteoblastic differentiation that was mediated through Smad1 and Smad5, and BMP signaling through ALK2(R206H) could be suppressed by Smad7 or dorsomorphin, two BMP type I receptor inhibitors. We further determined that mRNA levels of Smad1 and Smad5, but not Smad8 or ACVR1/ALK2, are increased in response to muscle injury in vivo. Because heterotopic bone formation in FOP commonly occurs following soft tissue injury, these data support the notion that the Smad1 and Smad5 increase following injury further enhances BMP signaling that has been pre-stimulated by a constitutively active ALK2 receptor mutation and leads to heterotopic bone formation. Smad7 and dorsomorphin may represent therapeutic approaches for inhibition of the BMP signaling induced by ALK2(R206H) in FOP. Genomic Sequence-Peripheral blood samples were obtained following informed consent from patients and their relatives in accordance with a protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of Saitama Medical University. Genomic DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA blood kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and exon 4 in the ALK2 gene amplified by PCR was directly sequenced using an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The following oligonucleotides were used as primers: 5′-CCAGTCCTTCTTCCTTCTTCC-3′ and 5′-AGCAGATTTTCCAAGTTCCATC-3′.

HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (12Katagiri T. Imada M. Yanai T. Suda T. Takahashi N. Kamijo R. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Stable ALK2(R206H)-expressing C2C12 cell lines were established by transfecting an expression vector, pcDEF3-ALK2(R206H), and selecting G418 at 700 μg/ml. BMP signaling was monitored using IdWT4F-luc or Id985-EGFPd2 reporter plasmids, which express a luciferase and a destabilized enhanced green fluorescent protein, respectively, under the control of a BMP-responsive element in the human ID1 gene as described previously (12Katagiri T.

Induction of Muscular Injury in Vivo-To induce muscular injury, 50 μl of habu (Trimeresurus flavoviridis) snake venom at 100 μg/kg or vehicle was injected into femoral muscles of 3-week-old C57BL/6 mice. After 3 and 7 days, RT-PCR, real time quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry were performed. The primers used were as described in supplemental Table S1. Real time RT-PCR for Smad1 and Smad5 was performed on Mx3000p (Stratagene, Tokyo, Japan) using QuantiTect Primer Assay (Qiagen). Muscle tissues were fixed with formalin and embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemical analysis. Statistical Analysis-Comparisons were made by using Student’s t test.

Identification of a 617G→A Mutation in ALK2 in 19 Japanese Patients with FOP-To determine whether FOP in Japanese patients is caused by the same recurrent mutation in ALK2 that was recently reported in familial and sporadic patients with FOP (21Shore E.M.

Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 525-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), we examined the genomic DNA of 19 Japanese FOP patients. Through DNA sequencing, we confirmed the identical 617G→A (R206H) mutation in the ACVR1/ALK2 gene in all 19 Japanese patients with FOP; however, none of the relatives that were examined carried the mutation, indicating that each of the 19 patients are sporadic cases (supplemental Fig. S1). ALK2(R206H) Is a Constitutively Activated BMP Receptor-To examine functional changes of the mutant ALK2 identified in FOP, we examined its intracellular signaling in vitro. Transfection of Smad1, a signaling protein specific for the BMP pathway, with ALK2(R206H), but not wild-type ALK2, induced phosphorylation of Smad1 in the absence of BMPs (Fig. 1A). Immunodetection assays showed that endogenous Smad1/5/8 were phosphorylated and accumulated in nuclei in response to ALK2(R206H) as well as BMPR-IA(Q233D), a form of this BMP type I receptor previously shown to be constitutively active (Fig. 1B) (26Akiyama S. Katagiri T. Namiki M. Yamaji N. Yamamoto N. Miyama K. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Wozney J.M. Suda T. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Promoter activity of the Id1 gene, one of the transcriptional targets of the BMP-Smad axis, was induced by ALK2(R206H) and by BMPR-IA(Q233D) but not wild-type ALK2 in a luciferase assay (Fig. 1C). Induction of the Id1 promoter by ALK2(R206H) was further confirmed using another construct, Id-EGFPd2 (12Katagiri T. Imada M. Yanai T. Suda T. Takahashi N. Kamijo R. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, D and E). We also examined the effects of ALK2(R206H) on myogenic differentiation and found that ALK2(R206H) as well as BMPR-IA(Q233D) markedly suppressed myogenesis in C3H10T1/2 cells transfected with a MyoD expression construct (Fig. 1F). Similar suppression of myogenesis by ALK2(R206H) was also observed in C2C12 myoblasts (data not shown). These findings indicate that ALK2(R206H) constitutively activates an intracellular signaling pathway specific for BMPs. Expression of Smad1 and Smad5 Are Up-regulated during Muscular Regeneration-Because injuries of muscle tissue induce heterotopic bone formation in FOP patients, we hypothesized that receptors or transcription factors that cooperate with ALK2(R206H) in stimulating bone formation are induced in response to muscular injury. To test this hypothesis, we quantified mRNA levels of BMP type I and type II receptors, and of Smads as downstream BMP signaling molecules, during muscular regeneration induced by an intramuscular injection of habu venom in mice. No BMP receptor mRNA levels were changed during muscular regeneration (Fig. 2A). Levels of Smad8, a BMP receptor-regulated Smad, and Smad4, a Co-Smad common to BMP and TGF-β signaling, were not changed during muscular regeneration (Fig. 2B). In contrast, expression levels of two BMP pathway-specific Smads, Smad1 and Smad5, were up-regulated as detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 2B), quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2C), and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2D). Levels of Smad1 and Smad5 mRNAs were increased up to ∼6-7-fold by day 3 (Fig. 2, B and C). Smad1 and Smad5 proteins were mainly detected in cells within the regenerating muscle tissues rather than myofibers (Fig. 2E). To examine the functional interaction of ALK2- and BMP-specific Smads, we co-transfected Smad1, Smad5, or Smad8 expression constructs with wild-type ALK2 or ALK2(R206H) into C2C12 myoblasts. Co-transfection and overexpression of Smad1 or Smad5 with ALK2(R206H) increased ALP activity, although enzyme activities were less than those induced by constitutively active BMPR-IA(Q233D) with Smad1 or Smad5 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, co-transfection of Smad8 with ALK2(R206H) induced lower levels of ALP activity than with co-transfection of Smad1 or Smad5, although levels of phosphorylation were not distinguishable among Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, co-transfection of Smad1 with ALK2(R206H) induced mRNAs related to osteoblastic differentiation such as ALP and osterix, although the levels of mRNAs were lower than that of BMPR-IA(Q233D) (Fig. 3C). However, these mRNAs were not induced by co-transfection of ALK2(R206H) or BMPR-IA(Q233D) with an inactive Smad1 mutant, Smad1(AVA), in which the carboxyl-terminal serine residues phosphorylated by BMP receptors were substituted with alanine residues. These findings suggest that the stimulatory effects of ALK2(R206H) and BMPR-IA(Q233D) on osteoblastic differentiation are mediated through phosphorylation of BMP-specific Smads. The ALP activity induced by ALK2(R206H) and Smad1 was further increased by treatment with BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, or BMP-7 (Fig. 4). Co-transfection of ALK2(R206H) and Smad1 with one of the BMP type II receptors (BMPR-II, ActR-II, or ActR-IIB) further increased ALP activity in the presence and absence of BMPs (data not shown).FIGURE 4BMPs further stimulate ALP activity induced by ALK2(R206H) and Smad1 in C2C12 myoblasts. C2C12 cells co-transfected with Smad1 and wild-type (WT) ALK2, ALK2(R206H), or BMPR-IA(Q233D) were treated for 3 days with 300 ng/ml of BMP-2 (A) or 100 ng/ml of BMP-4 (B), BMP-6 (C), or BMP-7 (D), and ALP activity was then determined.

We compared the effects of I-Smads on the intracellular signaling induced by ALK2(R206H) and BMPR-IA(Q233D). Both Smad6 and Smad7 at low amounts markedly inhibited the ALP activity induced by BMPR-IA(Q233D); however, only Smad7 markedly inhibited signaling by ALK2(R206H), confirming a recent report by Goto et al. (27Goto K. Kamiya Y. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Miyazawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20603-20611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5, B and C). Recently, the small molecule dorsomorphin was identified as a specific inhibitor of Smad-dependent signaling induced by BMP type I receptors ALK2, BMPR-IA, and BMPR-IB (28Yu P.B. Hong C.C. Sachidanandan C. Babitt J.L. Deng D.Y. Hoyng S.A. Lin H.Y. Bloch K.D. Peterson R.T. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Dorsomorphin almost completely inhibited the phosphorylation of FLAG-Smad1 induced by ALK2(R206H) (Fig. 6A). Moreover, dorsomorphin dose-dependently suppressed the ALP activity induced by ALK2(R206H) in C2C12 cells in conditions of both transient and stable overexpression (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. S2). ALK2(R206H) was less sensitive to dorsomorphin than BMPR-IA(Q233D) in suppression of ALP activity (Fig. 6B). We established subclonal cell lines of C2C12 myoblasts that stably expressed wild-type ALK2 or ALK2(R206H). Myogenesis of ALK2(R206H)-expressing C2C12 cells was suppressed in the absence of dorsomorphin (Fig. 6C). However, dorsomorphin dose-dependently increased the numbers of MHC-positive myotubes in ALK2(R206H)-expressing C2C12 cells (Fig. 6C). Recently, a recurrent mutation of 617G→A in the ACVR1/ALK2 gene was identified as the mutation responsible for FOP (21Shore E.M. Xu M. Feldman G.J. Fenstermacher D.A. Cho T.J. Choi I.H. Connor J.M.

These findings strongly support a causal role of the 617G→A mutation in the pathogenesis of disease for FOP patients with classic FOP. ALK2 is one of the type I receptors for BMPs, the most potent bone-inducing factors in vertebrates (6Urist M.R. Science. 1965; 150: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (4503) Google Scholar, 7Wozney J.M.

The common mutation identified in FOP patients causes a single amino acid substitution in ALK2, Arg to His in codon 206 within the GS domain. The GS domain is phosphorylated by BMP and TGF-β type I receptors following activation by ligand-bound type II receptors (9Miyazono K. Maeda S. Imamura T. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Substitutions of codon Gln-207 to aspartic acid in ALK2 and homologous positions in other type I receptors in the TGF-β superfamily result in constitutive activation of the serine/threonine kinases of these receptors without binding of ligands (26Akiyama S. Katagiri T. Namiki M. Yamaji N. Yamamoto N. Miyama K. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Wozney J.M. Suda T. Exp.

These findings led us to examine whether ALK2(R206H) is activated in FOP as a BMP receptor. As shown here, we found that ALK2(R206H) induces BMP-specific signaling via phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 even in the absence of BMPs or type II receptors, although the osteoblastic differentiation-inducing activity of ALK2(R206H) was weaker than those of BMPR-IA(Q233D) and ALK2(Q207D) (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Ours is thus the first study to elucidate biochemically that ALK2(R206H), the mutant receptor commonly identified in FOP, acts as a mild constitutively activated BMP type I receptor. The ALK2(R206H) mutation found in FOP is the first case of a natural gain-of-function mutation among the TGF-β superfamily receptors. Injury of muscle tissue induces local heterotopic bone formation in patients with FOP (33Connor J.M. Evans D.A. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Br. 1982; 64: 76-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lanchoney T.F.

We speculated that additional signals may be altered in response to muscular injury. This hypothesis was confirmed by our finding that levels of Smad1 and Smad5, two downstream signal transducers for the BMP receptors, were increased during muscle regeneration. Moreover, co-expression of ALK2(R206H) with Smad1 or Smad5 synergistically induced myoblasts to show increased phenotypic expression related to osteoblastic differentiation. These findings suggest that the heterotopic bone formation in patients with FOP may, in part, be caused by cooperative activity of the constitutively activated BMP receptor (ALK2(R206H)) with trauma-induced up-regulation of Smad1 and Smad5. Although up-regulation of Smad1 and Smad5 in patients with FOP should be examined, tissue samples from patients with FOP are not available because biopsy and surgery must be avoided in such patients to prevent induction of heterotopic bone formation. Moreover, treatments with BMPs further stimulated the osteoblastic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts expressing ALK2(R206H) (Fig. 4). We and others have identified BMP-4 and other osteogenic BMPs in serum in vertebrates (25Kodaira K. Imada M. Goto M. Tomoyasu A. Fukuda T. Kamijo R. Suda T. Higashio K. Katagiri T. Biochem. Biophys.

Res. 2008; 102: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and BMP-4 has been found to be overexpressed in lymphocytes in FOP (20Shafritz A.B. Shore E.M. Gannon F.H. Zasloff M.A. Taub R. Muenke M. Kaplan F.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). It might thus be possible that myoblasts in FOP patients are exposed to BMP ligands through bleeding after muscle injury, and that these events cooperatively stimulate the process of heterotopic bone formation further in muscle tissue. Interestingly, overexpression of wild-type ALK2 moderately inhibited myogenesis in the absence of BMPs and suppressed the ALP activity induced by BMPs. Because wild-type ALK2 did not induce detectable levels of the BMP-specific Smad pathway in the absence of BMPs (Fig. 1F), a non-Smad pathway might also play a role in this receptor inhibition (32Perry R.L. Parker M.H. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 291-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Alternatively, wild-type ALK2 may bind to other ligand(s) rather than BMPs in our culture conditions. Activin appears to be a possible ligand of ALK2, because it has been shown to be present in the circulation (38Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Huylebroeck D. Sampath T.K. Andries M. Smith J.C. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) and to suppress both myogenesis and osteoblastic differentiation in vitro (39Ikenoue T. Jingushi S. Urabe K. Okazaki K. Iwamoto Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 40Link B.A. Nishi R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, ALK2 was shown originally to bind to activin in the presence of appropriate type II receptors (41Attisano L. Carcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M. Massague J. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 42ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Franzen P. Schulz P. Saras J. Toyoshima H. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2879-2887PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to test this hypothesis. At present, no treatments are available to prevent heterotopic bone formation in FOP. Recently, the unique small molecule dorsomorphin was identified as a specific inhibitor of Smad-dependent signaling induced by BMP type I receptors (28Yu P.B. Hong C.C. Sachidanandan C. Babitt J.L. Deng D.Y. Hoyng S.A. Lin H.Y. Bloch K.D. Peterson R.T. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Because dorsomorphin was found to inhibit the BMP-specific signaling induced by the ALK2(R206H) mutant receptor, this compound provides proof of concept for intracellular signal transduction inhibition in the design of novel drugs for the treatment of FOP. As Smad7 is an intrinsic intracellular molecule, drugs that induce Smad7 expression might be useful as well. The findings presented here suggest that not only ALK2(R206H) but also a novel type of signaling that induces Smad1/5 are potential targets of treatment in patients with FOP. Unfortunately, however, we were unable to test these possibilities in vivo because there is no suitable in vivo model system reflecting the phenotypes of FOP. We are currently attempting to establish new mouse models of FOP using ALK2(R206H). We will, in the near future, be able to examine the inhibitory effects of dorsomorphin and other compounds in vivo using these models. In conclusion, we identified the ALK2(R206H) mutation in Japanese FOP patients. ALK2(R206H) is the first case of identification of a naturally activated BMP type I receptor in vertebrates. We found that Smad1 and Smad5 were induced in response to muscular injury and may play important roles in heterotopic bone formation after injury of muscle tissue in FOP. Molecules, including dorsomorphin and Smad7, will aid in the establishment of novel methods of treatment of FOP.

https://openalex.org/W1973827044,"Bacterial pathogens trigger specialized virulence factor secretion systems on encountering host cells. The ESX-1 protein secretion system of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-the causative agent of the human disease tuberculosis-delivers bacterial proteins into host cells during infection and is critical for virulence, but how it is regulated is unknown. Here we show that EspR (also known as Rv3849) is a key regulator of ESX-1 that is required for secretion and virulence in mice. EspR activates transcription of an operon that includes three ESX-1 components, Rv3616c-Rv3614c, whose expression in turn promotes secretion of ESX-1 substrates. EspR directly binds to and activates the Rv3616c-Rv3614c promoter and, unexpectedly, is itself secreted from the bacterial cell by the ESX-1 system that it regulates. Efflux of the DNA-binding regulator results in reduced Rv3616c-Rv3614c transcription, and thus reduced ESX-1 secretion. Our results reveal a direct negative feedback loop that regulates the activity of a secretion system essential for virulence. As the virulence factors secreted by the ESX-1 system are highly antigenic, fine control of secretion may be critical to successful infection."

https://openalex.org/W1968273273,"Energized mouse liver mitochondria displayed the same calcium retention capacity (a sensitive measure of the propensity of the permeability transition pore (PTP) to open) irrespective of whether phosphate, arsenate, or vanadate was the permeating anion. Unexpectedly, however, phosphate was specifically required for PTP desensitization by cyclosporin A (CsA) or by genetic inactivation of cyclophilin D (CyP-D). Indeed, when phosphate was replaced by arsenate, vanadate, or bicarbonate, the inhibitory effects of CsA and of CyP-D ablation on the PTP disappeared. After loading with the same amount of Ca(2+) in the presence of arsenate or vanadate but in the absence of phosphate, the sensitivity of the PTP to a variety of inducers was identical in mitochondria from wild-type mice, CyP-D-null mice, and wild-type mice treated with CsA. These findings call for a reassessment of conclusions on the role of the PTP in cell death that are based on the effects of CsA or of CyP-D ablation."
https://openalex.org/W2112822581,"There is compelling evidence to support the idea that autophagy has a protective function in neurons and its disruption results in neurodegenerative disorders. Neuronal damage is well-documented in the brains of HIV-infected individuals, and evidence of inflammation, oxidative stress, damage to synaptic and dendritic structures, and neuronal loss are present in the brains of those with HIV-associated dementia. We investigated the role of autophagy in microglia-induced neurotoxicity in primary rodent neurons, primate and human models. We demonstrate here that products of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected microglia inhibit neuronal autophagy, resulting in decreased neuronal survival. Quantitative analysis of autophagy vacuole numbers in rat primary neurons revealed a striking loss from the processes. Assessment of multiple biochemical markers of autophagic activity confirmed the inhibition of autophagy in neurons. Importantly, autophagy could be induced in neurons through rapamycin treatment, and such treatment conferred significant protection to neurons. Two major mediators of HIV-induced neurotoxicity, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and glutamate, had similar effects on reducing autophagy in neurons. The mRNA level of p62 was increased in the brain in SIV encephalitis and as well as in brains from individuals with HIV dementia, and abnormal neuronal p62 dot structures immunoreactivity was present and had a similar pattern with abnormal ubiquitinylated proteins. Taken together, these results identify that induction of deficits in autophagy is a significant mechanism for neurodegenerative processes that arise from glial, as opposed to neuronal, sources, and that the maintenance of autophagy may have a pivotal role in neuroprotection in the setting of HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W1963496118,"Carotenoids are produced by all photosynthetic organisms, where they play essential roles in light harvesting and photoprotection. The carotenoid biosynthetic pathway of diatoms is largely unstudied, but is of particular interest because these organisms have a very different evolutionary history with respect to the Plantae and are thought to be derived from an ancient secondary endosymbiosis between heterotrophic and autotrophic eukaryotes. Furthermore, diatoms have an additional xanthophyll-based cycle for dissipating excess light energy with respect to green algae and higher plants. To explore the origins and functions of the carotenoid pathway in diatoms we searched for genes encoding pathway components in the recently completed genome sequences of two marine diatoms. Consistent with the supplemental xanthophyll cycle in diatoms, we found more copies of the genes encoding violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE) and zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP) enzymes compared with other photosynthetic eukaryotes. However, the similarity of these enzymes with those of higher plants indicates that they had very probably diversified before the secondary endosymbiosis had occurred, implying that VDE and ZEP represent early eukaryotic innovations in the Plantae. Consequently, the diatom chromist lineage likely obtained all paralogues of ZEP and VDE genes during the process of secondary endosymbiosis by gene transfer from the nucleus of the algal endosymbiont to the host nucleus. Furthermore, the presence of a ZEP gene in Tetrahymena thermophila provides the first evidence for a secondary plastid gene encoded in a heterotrophic ciliate, providing support for the chromalveolate hypothesis. Protein domain structures and expression analyses in the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum indicate diverse roles for the different ZEP and VDE isoforms and demonstrate that they are differentially regulated by light. These studies therefore reveal the ancient origins of several components of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in photosynthetic eukaryotes and provide information about how they have diversified and acquired new functions in the diatoms."
https://openalex.org/W2082399023,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid beta-peptide (A-Beta) in the brain. Transthyretin (TTR) is a tetrameric protein of about 55 kDa mainly produced in the liver and choroid plexus of the brain. The known physiological functions of TTR are the transport of thyroid hormone T(4) and retinol, through binding to the retinol binding protein. TTR has also been established as a cryptic protease able to cleave ApoA-I in vitro. It has been described that TTR is involved in preventing A-Beta fibrilization, both by inhibiting and disrupting A-Beta fibrils, with consequent abrogation of toxicity. We further characterized the nature of the TTR/A-Beta interaction and found that TTR, both recombinant or isolated from human sera, was able to proteolytically process A-Beta, cleaving the peptide after aminoacid residues 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 14,16, 19 and 27, as determined by mass spectrometry, and reversed phase chromatography followed by N-terminal sequencing. A-Beta peptides (1-14) and (15-42) showed lower amyloidogenic potential than the full length counterpart, as assessed by thioflavin binding assay and ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy. A-Beta cleavage by TTR was inhibited in the presence of an alphaAPP peptide containing the Kunitz Protease Inhibitor (KPI) domain but not in the presence of the secreted alphaAPP derived from the APP isoform 695 without the KPI domain. TTR was also able to degrade aggregated forms of A-Beta peptide. Our results confirmed TTR as a protective molecule in AD, and prompted A-Beta proteolysis by TTR as a protective mechanism in this disease. TTR may prove to be a useful therapeutic agent for preventing or retarding the cerebral amyloid plaque formation implicated in AD pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2037587211,"Fermionic superfluidity requires the formation of particle pairs, the size of which varies depending on the system. Many properties of the superfluid depend on the pair size relative to the inter-particle spacing. For example, conventional superconductors comprise a superfluid of loosely bound, large Cooper pairs of electrons, while Bose-Einstein condensates contain tightly bound molecules. The microscopic properties of the fermion pairs can be probed with radio-frequency spectroscopy. However, previous results have been difficult to interpret due to strong final-state interactions that were not well understood. Schunck et al. realize a superfluid spin mixture in an ultracold gas of lithium atoms in which such interactions have negligible influence. They find that the spectroscopic pair size is smaller than the inter-particle spacing. These are the smallest pairs yet observed for fermionic superfluids. In a related experiment, Jin et al use a technique called photoemission spectroscopy to study the excitations in a strongly interacting gas of ultracold potassium atoms. Such studies are of interest because the physics is related to that of the high transition-temperature superconductors, which are not fully understood. Microscopic properties of fermion pairs can be probed with radio-frequency spectroscopy. But previous work was difficult to interpret due to strong final-state interactions, which were not well understood. A superfluid spin mixture in an ultracold atomic gas in which such interactions have negligible influence is realized, and it is found that the spectroscopic pair size is smaller than the inter-particle spacing. These are the smallest pairs yet observed for fermionic superfluids. Fermionic superfluidity requires the formation of particle pairs, the size of which varies from the femtometre scale in neutron stars and nuclei to the micrometre scale in conventional superconductors. Many properties of the superfluid depend on the pair size relative to the interparticle spacing. This is expressed in ‘BCS–BEC crossover’ theories1,2,3, describing the crossover from a Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS)-type superfluid of loosely bound, large Cooper pairs to Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) of tightly bound molecules. Such a crossover superfluid has been realized in ultracold atomic gases where high-temperature superfluidity has been observed4,5. The microscopic properties of the fermion pairs can be probed using radio-frequency spectroscopy. However, previous work6,7,8 was difficult to interpret owing to strong final-state interactions that were not well understood. Here we realize a superfluid spin mixture in which such interactions have negligible influence and present fermion pair dissociation spectra that reveal the underlying pairing correlations. This allows us to determine that the spectroscopic pair size in the resonantly interacting gas is 20 per cent smaller than the interparticle spacing. These are the smallest pairs so far observed in fermionic superfluids, highlighting the importance of small fermion pairs for superfluidity at high critical temperatures9. We have also identified transitions from fermion pairs to bound molecular states and to many-body bound states in the case of strong final-state interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2001904989,"Dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) catalyzes the first committed step of the lysine biosynthetic pathway. The tetrameric structure of DHDPS is thought to be essential for enzymatic activity, as isolated dimeric mutants of Escherichia coli DHDPS possess less than 2.5% that of the activity of the wild-type tetramer. It has recently been proposed that the dimeric form lacks activity due to increased dynamics. Tetramerization, by buttressing two dimers together, reduces dynamics in the dimeric unit and explains why all active bacterial DHDPS enzymes to date have been shown to be homo-tetrameric. However, in this study we demonstrate for the first time that DHDPS from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution. Fluorescence-detected analytical ultracentrifugation was employed to show that the dimerization dissociation constant of MRSA-DHDPS is 33 nm in the absence of substrates and 29 nm in the presence of (S)-aspartate semialdehyde (ASA), but is 20-fold tighter in the presence of the substrate pyruvate (1.6 nm). The MRSA-DHDPS dimer exhibits a ping-pong kinetic mechanism (kcat = 70 ± 2 s-1, KmPyruvate = 0.11 ± 0.01 mm, and KmASA = 0.22 ± 0.02 mm) and shows ASA substrate inhibition with a KsiASA of 2.7 ± 0.9 mm. We also demonstrate that unlike the E. coli tetramer, the MRSA-DHDPS dimer is insensitive to lysine inhibition. The near atomic resolution (1.45Å) crystal structure confirms the dimeric quaternary structure and reveals that the dimerization interface of the MRSA enzyme is more extensive in buried surface area and noncovalent contacts than the equivalent interface in tetrameric DHDPS enzymes from other bacterial species. These data provide a detailed mechanistic insight into DHDPS catalysis and the evolution of quaternary structure of this important bacterial enzyme. Dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) catalyzes the first committed step of the lysine biosynthetic pathway. The tetrameric structure of DHDPS is thought to be essential for enzymatic activity, as isolated dimeric mutants of Escherichia coli DHDPS possess less than 2.5% that of the activity of the wild-type tetramer. It has recently been proposed that the dimeric form lacks activity due to increased dynamics. Tetramerization, by buttressing two dimers together, reduces dynamics in the dimeric unit and explains why all active bacterial DHDPS enzymes to date have been shown to be homo-tetrameric. However, in this study we demonstrate for the first time that DHDPS from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution. Fluorescence-detected analytical ultracentrifugation was employed to show that the dimerization dissociation constant of MRSA-DHDPS is 33 nm in the absence of substrates and 29 nm in the presence of (S)-aspartate semialdehyde (ASA), but is 20-fold tighter in the presence of the substrate pyruvate (1.6 nm). The MRSA-DHDPS dimer exhibits a ping-pong kinetic mechanism (kcat = 70 ± 2 s-1, KmPyruvate = 0.11 ± 0.01 mm, and KmASA = 0.22 ± 0.02 mm) and shows ASA substrate inhibition with a KsiASA of 2.7 ± 0.9 mm. We also demonstrate that unlike the E. coli tetramer, the MRSA-DHDPS dimer is insensitive to lysine inhibition. The near atomic resolution (1.45Å) crystal structure confirms the dimeric quaternary structure and reveals that the dimerization interface of the MRSA enzyme is more extensive in buried surface area and noncovalent contacts than the equivalent interface in tetrameric DHDPS enzymes from other bacterial species. These data provide a detailed mechanistic insight into DHDPS catalysis and the evolution of quaternary structure of this important bacterial enzyme. Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium responsible for a wide range of clinical diseases (1Furuya E.Y. Lowy F.D. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and an increased incidence of antibiotic resistance (2United Kingdom Health Protection Agency (2004) Staphylococcus aureus Bacteraemia Laboratory Reports and Methicillin Susceptibility: England and Wales 1990–2004Google Scholar). Antibiotic resistant strains, like methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 3The abbreviations used are: MRSA, methicillin-resistant; ASA, (S)-aspartate-β-semialdehyde; DHDPS, dihydrodipicolinate synthase; s20,w, standardized sedimentation coefficient; SAapp, apparent specific activity; DHDPR, dihydrodipicolinate synthase. have significantly increased the mortality rate and financial burden on healthcare amenities worldwide (3Casewell M.W.

Accordingly, there is an urgent need to discover new antibiotics targeting MRSA and an equally urgent need to characterize novel drug targets. One such target is dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) (6Hutton C.A. Perugini M.A. Gerrard J.A. Mol. Biosyst. 2007; 3: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). DHDPS catalyzes the condensation of ASA and pyruvate (Fig. 1A) in the first committed step of the biosynthesis of lysine in plants and bacteria, a pathway absent in humans. Given that bacterial DHDPS is the product of an essential gene (7Kobayashi K. Ehrlich S.D. Albertini A. Amati G. Andersen K.K. Arnaud M. Asai K. Ashikaga S. Aymerich S. Bessieres P. Boland F.

Biosyst. 2007; 3: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We have, therefore, been interested in understanding how DHDPS functions for the development of inhibitors and also from a mechanistic standpoint. We and others have extensively studied the catalytic mechanism of DHDPS enzymes from various organisms (11Blickling S. Renner C. Laber B. Pohlenz H.-D. Holak T.A. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12Dobson R.C.J. Gerrard J.A. Pearce F.G. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 757-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dobson R.C.J. Griffin M. Roberts S.J. Gerrard J.A. Biochimie. (Paris). 2004; 86: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli the key catalytic triad residues of DHDPS have been identified as Thr-44, Tyr-107, and Tyr-133, which serve as a proton relay between the substrates and bulk solvent (14Dobson R.C.J. Valegård K. Gerrard J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thr-44 and Tyr-133 are located in the active sites of each monomer, whereas Tyr-107 interdigitates across the tight-dimer interface such that Tyr-107 forms part of the active site in each adjacent subunit. Lys-161, which forms a Schiff base with the substrate pyruvate, and Arg-138 and Gly-186, which appear to stabilize ASA binding and cyclization, also play a role in catalysis. The monomeric structure of DHDPS is an (α/β)8 barrel with a C-terminal α-helical domain and is generally considered to form a homo-tetramer in a dimer of tight-dimers configuration (Fig. 1B). The self-association of two monomers to form the tight-dimer unit results in the generation of an allosteric site that binds lysine in E. coli DHDPS (Fig. 1B) and mediates feedback inhibition. However, recent work in our laboratories has shown that mutant dimeric forms of E. coli DHDPS are less active than the wild-type tetramer due to relaxed substrate specificity (11Blickling S. Renner C. Laber B. Pohlenz H.-D. Holak T.A. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This is hypothesized to be a result of increased dynamics at the tight-dimer interface, which in turn alters the positioning of the key catalytic triad residues discussed above. The wild-type tetramer, which is formed from two tight-dimers buttressed together, reduces the dynamics at the tight-dimer interface and, thus, within the active site. In this study we focused our investigation on the structure and function of DHDPS from MRSA (MRSA-DHDPS). We report that MRSA-DHDPS resides in a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution that is stabilized by the substrate pyruvate and demonstrate the enzyme to be the first example of a functional, native dimer of DHDPS. We also present a 1.45-Å resolution x-ray crystal structure that highlights important structural features of the dimer. These findings provide insight into the evolution of the quaternary structure of an essential bacterial enzyme. Common laboratory methods were performed according to Sambrook and Russell (15Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2001Google Scholar), and reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Australia, or Merck Australia, unless otherwise stated. Mass Spectrometry—Electrospray ionization time of flight mass spectrometry was performed on an Agilent 6510 quadrupole-time of flight spectrometer coupled to a dual electrospray ionization source as described previously (16Griffin M.D.W. Dobson R.C.J. Pearce F.G. Antonio L. Whitten A.E. Liew C.K. Mackay J.P. Trewhella J. Jameson G.B. Perugini M.A. Gerrard J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Native Gel Electrophoresis—PAGE was performed in a 12% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel run at 4 °C for 5 h at 60 V before staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectroscopy was performed using a Jasco J-815 CD spectrometer with sample prepared in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, in a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette with a step size of 0.5 nm and 2 s averaging time. Spectra were fitted using CDPRO (17Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar) employing the CDSSTR algorithm and the SP43 protein data base (18Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Absorbance-based Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity studies of MRSA-DHDPS (3.1 μm) and E. coli DHDPS (3.1 μm) were performed at a wavelength of 229 nm using an XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter) with a 4-hole An60-Ti rotor at 20 °C. Double sector centrifuge cells with quartz windows were loaded with 380 μl of sample and 400 μl of reference (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Sedimentation velocity data were collected at 40,000 rpm at 6-min intervals and fitted to the enhanced van Holde-Weischet method (19Demeler B. van Holde K.E. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 335: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) using ULTRASCAN (20Demeler B. Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Techniques and Methods. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK2005: 210-229Google Scholar) or a continuous size-distribution model using SEDFIT (21Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3058) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-detected Sedimentation Velocity and Sedimentation Equilibrium Analyses—Fluorescence-detected sedimentation studies were conducted in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a fluorescence detection system (Aviv Biomedical) using MRSA-DHDPS (0.39, 1.6, 6.3, and 25 nm) labeled with the Alexa Fluor 488 succinimidyl ester. The labeling procedure involved preincubation of 19.4 nmol of MRSA-DHDPS with 5 mm sodium pyruvate in 100 μl of 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 8.3, at room temperature for 5 min to protect the active site lysine (Lys-163) from modification. To this, 194 nmol of Alexa Fluor 488 (0.5 μl) was added and incubated for a further 80 min at room temperature. These represent optimized conditions, such that (on average) one fluorophore was covalently linked per MRSA-DHDPS monomer. Unincorporated dye was removed by Sephacryl S200 gel filtration liquid chromatography on a 1.0-cm (diameter) × 30-cm (length) column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 (reference solution). Fractions containing labeled MRSA-DHDPS were incubated with 1.4 mm ASA to remove pyruvate from the active site as product. Unreacted substrates and product were removed by gel filtration liquid chromatography as described previously. The labeling procedure did not dramatically alter the activity of the enzyme (supplemental Fig. 1F). Double sector centrifuge cells with sapphire windows were loaded with 380 μl of sample and 400 μl of reference (sedimentation velocity) or 100 μl of sample and 120 μl of reference (sedimentation equilibrium). Sedimentation velocity data were collected continuously at 40,000 rpm and fitted to a continuous size-distribution model using SEDFIT (21Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3058) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium data collected at 10,000 and 16,000 rpm were analyzed using SEDPHAT (22Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza T.A. Rouault P. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 234-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) after correction for the photomultiplier voltage and pseudo-absorbance normalization. Coupled Kinetics Assay—Kinetic analysis of MRSA-DHDPS was performed using the DHDPS/dihydrodipicolinate reductase (DHDPR) coupled assay (14Dobson R.C.J. Valegård K. Gerrard J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Coulter C.V. Gerrard J.A. Kraunsoe J.A.E. Pratt A.P. Pestic. Sci. 1999; 55: 887-895Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ASA was prepared according to the method of Roberts et al. (24Roberts S.J. Morris J.C. Dobson R.C.J. Gerrard J.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Dihydrodipicolinate reductase was considered to be in excess when a 2-fold concentration increase did not affect the initial rate. Assays were performed in 10-mm path length, 1.5-ml reduced-volume acrylic cuvettes in triplicate with 150 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.16 mm NADPH, 0.09–3 mm pyruvate, and ASA, 26 nm DHDPS, and at least a 10-fold molar excess of DHDPR in a final volume of 0.7 ml. Cuvettes were preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C before reaction initiation with DHDPS (varied substrate analysis) or ASA (varied enzyme concentration analysis) with data collected using a temperature-controlled Cary5 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian). Rates were calculated from the initial linear portion of data and analyzed using ENZFITTER (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Structure Determination—X-ray diffraction data from crystals of MRSA-DHDPS were collected at the Australian Synchrotron (Clayton, Australia) and were published elsewhere (25Burgess B.R. Dobson R.C.J. Dogovski C. Jameson G.B. Parker M.W. Perugini M.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2008; 64: 659-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Diffraction data were integrated and scaled using the MOSFLM (26Leslie, A. G. W. (1992) Joint CCP4+ ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography No. 26, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UKGoogle Scholar) and SCALA (27Diederichs K. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) software. Initial phase estimation by molecular replacement was performed using PHASER (28McCoy A.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2007; 63: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar), with a single monomer of E. coli DHDPS (PDB ID 1YXC (29Dobson R.C.J. Griffin M.D. Jameson G.B. Gerrard J.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2005; 61: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)) as a search model. Structural refinement was performed using REFMAC5 (30Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar) with iterative manual model building using WINCOOT (31Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23344) Google Scholar). Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied in the early stages of refinement and were released for most residues as the phases improved. Waters were added at later stages using WINCOOT and ARPWATERS (32Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final refinement rounds included the addition of hydrogen atoms and anisotropic refinement with REF-MAC5 (30Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar), which resulted in a 1.8% drop in the RFree. The final model was checked with PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) and deposited in the PDB data bank (PDB ID 3DAQ). ApoMRSA-DHDPS Exists in a Monomer-Dimer Equilibrium in Solution—MRSA-DHDPS was expressed and purified as described elsewhere (25Burgess B.R. Dobson R.C.J. Dogovski C. Jameson G.B. Parker M.W. Perugini M.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2008; 64: 659-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The enzyme was initially characterized by electrospray ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and CD spectroscopy to show that the mass of the recombinant product was consistent with the amino acid sequence of the native protein after methionine cleavage (supplemental Fig. 1A) and that the enzyme was folded in aqueous solution (supplemental Fig. 1B). Next we assessed the quaternary structure of the enzyme by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Given the conserved tetrameric structure of bacterial DHDPS, we surprisingly show that native MRSA-DHDPS (RF = 0.46) migrates significantly farther on native PAGE than the native E. coli DHDPS tetramer (RF = 0.13) (supplemental Fig. 1C), suggesting the oligomeric form of the MRSA enzyme is smaller than the E. coli DHDPS tetramer. Therefore, a more quantitative approach was sought to characterize the quaternary structure of MRSA-DHDPS. Sedimentation velocity experiments were subsequently performed over a concentration range of 1.5–4.6 μm MRSA-DH-DPS using absorbance-detected analytical ultracentrifugation. Representative raw data generated at 40,000 rpm for MRSA-DHDPS and E. coli DHDPS at the same initial concentration (3.1 μm) are compared in supplemental Fig. 1D. These data were fitted to an enhanced van Holde-Weischet model (19Demeler B. van Holde K.E. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 335: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), which indicated that MRSA-DHDPS sediments with a standardized sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of 4.2 S, compared with 6.5 S for E. coli DHDPS (Fig. 2A). These values are consistent with the sedimentation coefficients previously reported for dimeric and tetrameric species of native E. coli DHDPS, respectively (34Perugini M.A. Griffin M.D. Smith B.J. Webb L.E. Davis A.J. Handman E. Gerrard J.A. Eur. Biophys. J. 2005; 34: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using the c(s) distribution method (supplemental Fig. 1E). The results of the sedimentation velocity analyses suggest that the MRSA enzyme is indeed dimeric at high concentrations in solution. Pyruvate Shifts the Equilibrium in Favor of the Dimer—To investigate the quaternary structure of MRSA-DHDPS in the presence of substrates and to probe the stability of the dimer in solution, fluorescence-detected sedimentation studies were employed at low (nm) enzyme concentrations. Sedimentation velocity analysis of 25 nm MRSA-DHDPS showed a relatively broad and asymmetric c(s) distribution with a weight-average standardized sedimentation coefficient of 3.3 S, which remains unchanged in the presence of 2.0 mm ASA (Table 1; Fig. 2B). However, the addition of 2 mm pyruvate resulted in an altered c(s) distribution with a weight-average s20,w of 4.0 S, suggesting pyruvate stabilizes the dimeric form of the enzyme (Table 1, Fig. 2B).TABLE 1Solution properties of MRSA-DHDPS in the presence and absence of substratesMRSA-DHDPS sampleswaWeight-average standardized sedimentation coefficientKD2→1Global reduced χ2bValues obtained from the global nonlinear least squares best fit to a monomerdimer equilibrium (Fig. 2C, supplemental Fig. 2)SnmApoenzyme3.3333.8 × 10–2+2.0 mm pyruvate4.01.64.3 × 10–2+2.0 mm ASA3.3296.8 × 10–2a Weight-average standardized sedimentation coefficientb Values obtained from the global nonlinear least squares best fit to a monomerdimer equilibrium (Fig. 2C, supplemental Fig. 2) Open table in a new tab To quantify this phenomenon, sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted at 0.39, 1.6, 6.3, and 25 nm MRSA-DHDPS in the presence and absence of a saturating concentration of pyruvate (2.0 mm) and at two rotor speeds (10,000 and 16,000 rpm). Global nonlinear least squares analyses of the data at both speeds were performed with the mass fixed to the theoretical monomer, dimer, trimer, or tetramer mass of MRSA-DHDPS. The nonlinear least square global best fit was obtained to a dimeric model for the apo form and also in the presence of pyruvate, with global reduced χ2 values of 2.5 × 10-1 and 5.5 × 10-2, respectively (fits not shown). Subsequently, these data were globally fitted to multiple self-association models, including a monomer-dimer, monomer-trimer, and monomer-tetramer equilibrium. Not surprisingly, the best fit was obtained to a monomer-dimer equilibrium yielding a dimerization dissociation constant (KD2→1) of 33 nm without substrate and 1.6 nm in the presence of pyruvate with global reduced χ2 values of 3.8 × 10-2 and 4.3 × 10-2, respectively (Fig. 2C, supplemental Fig. 2, Table 1) By contrast, the global nonlinear best fit yielded a KD2→1 of 29 nm in the presence of ASA (Table 1). Taken together, native gel electrophoresis and analytical ultracentrifugation results indicate that native MRSA-DHDPS forms a tight dimer in solution that is not significantly changed in the presence of the substrate ASA, but is stabilized by more than 20-fold in the presence of the substrate pyruvate. This is important as the enzyme kinetic studies described below were conducted at a MRSA-DHDPS concentration that is 16.5-fold higher than the KD2→1 calculated in the presence of pyruvate (Table 1). The MRSA-DHDPS Dimer Is Catalytically Active—Given that dimeric mutants of the E. coli enzyme showed reduced activity, we were very interested in determining if the MRSA-DHDPS dimer was catalytically active. The coupled assay was used to collect initial rate data for MRSA-DHDPS with varied concentrations of the two substrates, pyruvate and ASA. First, we measured the initial rate over an enzyme concentration range of 0.09 to 50 nm, which is below and above the KD2→1. The data show that the relationship between initial rate and enzyme concentration deviates from linearity at enzyme concentrations below 2 nm (Fig. 2D). The reduced activity at low concentrations (approaching and below the KD2→1 of 1.6 nm in the presence of pyruvate) suggests that the MRSA-DHDPS monomer is less active than the dimer. This is supported by Fig. 2E, which shows the apparent specific activity (SAapp) calculated from the data in Fig. 2D plotted as a function of total MRSA-DHDPS monomer concentration. Nonlinear regression analysis of these data fitted to a monomer-dimer equilibrium (Equation 1, supplemental material) yields an SAapp of 90 μmol min-1 mg-1 for the monomer, 160 μmol min-1 mg-1 for the dimer, and a KD2→1 of 1.0 ± 1.1 nm (R2 = 0.94). This analysis demonstrates the monomer of MRSA-DHDPS has significantly reduced activity compared with the dimer and also results in a KD2→1 that is consistent with our solution studies in the presence of pyruvate (Table 1). Statistically the fit was identical (R2 = 0.94) when the specific activities were optimized, but KD2→1 was fixed to 1.6 nm, the value calculated from our sedimentation equilibrium analyses (Table 1). To determine the kinetic parameters of MRSA-DHDPS, initial rate data were measured with varying concentrations of both substrates (pyruvate and ASA) at an enzyme concentration of 26 nm, a concentration at which the enzyme is predominantly dimeric. The data obtained were fitted by least squares nonlinear regression to yield a best fit to a ping-pong mechanism, with ASA substrate inhibition (Ksi = 2.7 ± 0.9 mm) (Fig. 2F). Furthermore, we show by measuring the activity of MRSA-DHDPS over a broad lysine concentration range that MRSA-DHDPS is insensitive to lysine-feedback inhibition (supplemental Fig. 1G). The catalytic turnover (kcat) of MRSA-DHDPS was determined to be 70 ± 2 s-1, which is similar to that observed for E. coli DHDPS (14Dobson R.C.J. Valegård K. Gerrard J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, the Km values for pyruvate and ASA of MRSA-DHDPS were determined to be 0.11 ± 0.01 and 0.22 ± 0.02 mm, respectively. These correspond well with those reported for E. coli DHDPS, which are 0.26 ± 0.03 and 0.11 ± 0.01 mm for pyruvate and ASA, respectively. Given that the MRSA-DHDPS dimer is enzymatically active, we were interested in determining the three-dimensional structure of the dimer. The Crystal Structure of MRSA-DHDPS Provides Insight into Its Functional Evolution—To understand the underlying molecular basis for catalysis by the MRSA-DHDPS dimer, we turned to x-ray crystallography. The crystal structure was solved to near-atomic resolution (1.45 Å) with a final Rfree of 16.1% and an Rwork of 13.2% (PDB ID 3DAQ). The final model included four polypeptide chains and nine glycerol molecules, including one in each of the four active sites, perhaps reflecting the similar size of glycerol to the enzyme substrate, pyruvate. One chloride ion was also observed bonded to T13 in each monomer and presumably comes from the crystallization buffer. Refinement statistics and geometric parameters are shown in Table 2. The Ramachandran plot showed that 99.6% of the modeled residues were in allowed regions. Only Tyr-109, which is part of the catalytic triad, was found to be outside the allowed regions. This has been previously observed in DHDPS enzymes from other sources (29Dobson R.C.J. Griffin M.D. Jameson G.B. Gerrard J.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Fig. 3B shows an overlay of the allosteric site residues of E. coli DHDPS (29Dobson R.C.J. Griffin M.D. Jameson G.B. Gerrard J.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2005; 61: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and the equivalent residues in the MRSA enzyme. Little structural conservation was observed, indicating why MRSA-DHDPS is insensitive to lysine inhibition (supplemental Fig. 1G). A number of side chains including Glu-84, His-56, and His-53, which are known to interact with lysine in E. coli DHDPS (29Dobson R.C.J. Griffin M.D. Jameson G.B. Gerrard J.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2005; 61: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), are not conserved in the MRSA enzyme and instead are replaced by Lys-86, Lys-57, and Thr-55 (Fig. 3B). The dimer interface of MRSA-DHDPS shows a greater solvent-inaccessible surface area than all other DHDPS crystal structures with demonstrated activity (Fig. 3C; Table 3). A relatively high number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions were also observed, suggesting the dynamic fluctuations of dimeric E. coli DHDPS mutants may be restricted in MRSA-DHDPS by tighter binding across the dimer interface. A temperature factor analysis of the MRSA-DHDPS dimer shows that residues important in stabilizing the dimer interface have an overall reduced temperature factor compared with the average value for all residues in the structure and also the comparative residues in the E. coli homologue (supplemental Figs. 3, A and B). Similarly, the temperature factors of the key catalytic residues are also reduced compared with the average value across all residues (supplemental Fig. 3A).TABLE 3Comparison of the tight-dimer interface of bacterial DHDPS enzymes The number of hydrophobic contacts was assessed using Protein Dossier and was based on a maximum non-hydrogen bonding distance of 3.8 Å.

However, the orientation of Tyr-109 was quite different while still maintaining the conserved hydrogen-bonding network of the catalytic triad (Tyr-109—Thr-45—Tyr-135). The aromatic ring of Tyr-109 is twisted ∼60° relative to the equivalent residue in the E. coli structure, providing a closer aromatic stacking interaction in MRSA-DHDPS compared with the E. coli enzyme (Fig. 3E). Along with the increased buried surface area and higher number of interface interactions compared with other DHDPS tight-dimers, the more extensive buttressing of Tyr-109 in MRSA-DHDPS dimer may explain the increased activity compared with the E. coli dimeric enzymes. Increased/altered dynamic motion in the dimeric E. coli mutants (compared with the wild-type tetramer) is hypothesized to specifically interfere with Tyr-107 of the catalytic triad (E. coli DHDPS numbering). For MRSA-DHDPS, this motif appears to possess stronger contacts and, thus, allows the formation of a catalytically competent and substrate-specific active site. This offers an alternative strategy to tetramerization, as observed in all other active DHDPS enzymes to date. Evolutionary Implications—The increased buried surface area at the dimer interface and greater contacts to the key catalytic residue (Tyr-109) is a hitherto unseen strategy to combat the dynamic fluctuations observed in dimeric E. coli DHDPS mutants by Griffin et al. (16Griffin M.D.W. Dobson R.C.J. Pearce F.G. Antonio L. Whitten A.E. Liew C.K. Mackay J.P. Trewhella J. Jameson G.B. Perugini M.A. Gerrard J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This suggests the commonly observed DHDPS tetramer evolved from an ancient primordial monomer via a dynamically unstable dimer, consistent with the expected route of quaternary structure evolution described by Levy et al. (39Levy E.D. Boeri Erba E. Robinson C.V. Teichmann S.A. Nature. 2008; 453: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Given the tetramer is observed across a wide range of bacterial species, it seems more likely that the active MRSA-DHDPS dimer has resulted from divergent (rather than parallel) evolution. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis may provide further insight into these observations. Conclusions—The results of this study demonstrate that DHDPS from methicillin-resistant S. aureus exists in a monomerdimer equilibrium that is significantly shifted in favor of the dimer in the presence of the substrate pyruvate. The MRSA-DHDPS tight dimer is the first native and active dimeric form of a DHDPS enzyme described to date. X-ray structural analyses show that the MRSA-DHDPS dimer has significantly increased contacts and greater buried surface area at the dimer interface compared with the tight-dimer interface in the archetypal tetrameric forms. This provides insight into the evolution of quaternary structure of DHDPS and suggests that two alternative mechanisms have evolved to overcome increased dynamics in the dimeric unit.

https://openalex.org/W2019116727,"Background The response rate to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may be poor and unpredictable in cancer patients with EGFR expression itself being an inadequate response indicator. There is limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying this resistance. Furthermore, although TKIs suppress the growth of HER2-overexpressing breast tumor cells, they do not fully inhibit HER2 oncogenic function at physiological doses. Methodology and Principal Findings Here we have provided a molecular mechanism of how HER2 oncogenic function escapes TKIs' inhibition via alternative HER receptor activation as a result of autocrine ligand release. Using both Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) which monitors in situ HER receptor phosphorylation as well as classical biochemical analysis, we have shown that the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of EGFR, AG1478 and Iressa (Gefitinib) decreased EGFR and HER3 phosphorylation through the inhibition of EGFR/HER3 dimerization. Consequent to this, we demonstrate that cleavage of HER4 and dimerization of HER4/HER2 occur together with reactivation of HER3 via HER2/HER3, leading to persistent HER2 phosphorylation in the now resistant, surviving cells. These drug treatment–induced processes were found to be mediated by the release of ligands including heregulin and betacellulin that activate HER3 and HER4 via HER2. Whereas an anti-betacellulin antibody in combination with Iressa increased the anti-proliferative effect in resistant cells, ligands such as heregulin and betacellulin rendered sensitive SKBR3 cells resistant to Iressa. Conclusions and Significance These results demonstrate the role of drug-induced autocrine events leading to the activation of alternative HER receptors in maintaining HER2 phosphorylation and in mediating resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in breast cancer cells, and hence specify treatment opportunities to overcome resistance in patients."
https://openalex.org/W1971556961,"Radiotherapy (RT) is the primary treatment modality for inoperable, locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but even with highly conformal treatment planning, radiation pneumonitis (RP) remains the most serious, dose-limiting complication. Previous clinical reports proposed that cytokine plasma levels measured during RT allow to estimate the individual risk of patients to develop RP. The identification of such cytokine risk profiles would facilitate tailoring radiotherapy to maximize treatment efficacy and to minimize radiation toxicity. However, cytokines are produced not only in normal lung tissue after irradiation, but are also over-expressed in tumour cells of NSCLC specimens. This tumour-derived cytokine production may influence circulating plasma levels in NSCLC patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TGF-beta1 plasma levels to predict radiation pneumonitis and to evaluate the impact of tumour-derived cytokine production on circulating plasma levels in patients irradiated for NSCLC.In 52 NSCLC patients (stage I-III) cytokine plasma levels were investigated by ELISA before and weekly during RT, during follow-up (1/3/6/9 months after RT), and at the onset of RP. Tumour biopsies were immunohistochemically stained for IL-6 and TGF-beta1, and immunoreactivity was quantified (grade 1-4). RP was evaluated according to LENT-SOMA scale. Tumour response was assessed according to RECIST criteria by chest-CT during follow-up. In our clinical study 21 out of 52 patients developed RP (grade I/II/III/IV: 11/3/6/1 patients). Unexpectedly, cytokine plasma levels measured before and during RT did not correlate with RP incidence. In most patients IL-6 and TGF-beta1 plasma levels were already elevated before RT and correlated significantly with the IL-6 and TGF-beta1 production in corresponding tumour biopsies. Moreover, IL-6 and TGF-beta1 plasma levels measured during follow-up were significantly associated with the individual tumour responses of these patients.The results of this study did not confirm that cytokine plasma levels, neither their absolute nor any relative values, may identify patients at risk for RP. In contrast, the clear correlations of IL-6 and TGF-beta1 plasma levels with the cytokine production in corresponding tumour biopsies and with the individual tumour responses suggest that the tumour is the major source of circulating cytokines in patients receiving RT for advanced NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2083104990,"Adults of the common green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), are prevalent pollen-consumers in maize fields. They are therefore exposed to insecticidal proteins expressed in the pollen of insect-resistant, genetically engineered maize varieties expressing Cry proteins derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of Cry3Bb1 or Cry1Ab-expressing transgenic maize (MON 88017, Event Bt176) pollen on fitness parameters of adult C. carnea. Adults were fed pollen from Bt maize varieties or their corresponding near isolines together with sucrose solution for 28 days. Survival, pre-oviposition period, fecundity, fertility and dry weight were not different between Bt or non-Bt maize pollen treatments. In order to ensure that adults of C. carnea are not sensitive to the tested toxins independent from the plant background and to add certainty to the hazard assessment, adult C. carnea were fed with artificial diet containing purified Cry3Bb1 or Cry1Ab at about a 10 times higher concentration than in maize pollen. Artificial diet containing Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) was included as a positive control. No differences were found in any life-table parameter between Cry protein containing diet treatments and control diet. However, the pre-oviposition period, daily and total fecundity and dry weight of C. carnea were significantly negatively affected by GNA-feeding. In both feeding assays, the stability and bioactivity of Cry proteins in the food sources as well as the uptake by C. carnea was confirmed. These results show that adults of C. carnea are not affected by Bt maize pollen and are not sensitive to Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1 at concentrations exceeding the levels in pollen. Consequently, Bt maize pollen consumption will pose a negligible risk to adult C. carnea."
https://openalex.org/W2114523465,"Background Eukaryotic cells seem unable to monitor replication completion during normal S phase, yet must ensure a reliable replication completion time. This is an acute problem in early Xenopus embryos since DNA replication origins are located and activated stochastically, leading to the random completion problem. DNA combing, kinetic modelling and other studies using Xenopus egg extracts have suggested that potential origins are much more abundant than actual initiation events and that the time-dependent rate of initiation, I(t), markedly increases through S phase to ensure the rapid completion of unreplicated gaps and a narrow distribution of completion times. However, the molecular mechanism that underlies this increase has remained obscure. Methodology/Principal Findings Using both previous and novel DNA combing data we have confirmed that I(t) increases through S phase but have also established that it progressively decreases before the end of S phase. To explore plausible biochemical scenarios that might explain these features, we have performed comparisons between numerical simulations and DNA combing data. Several simple models were tested: i) recycling of a limiting replication fork component from completed replicons; ii) time-dependent increase in origin efficiency; iii) time-dependent increase in availability of an initially limiting factor, e.g. by nuclear import. None of these potential mechanisms could on its own account for the data. We propose a model that combines time-dependent changes in availability of a replication factor and a fork-density dependent affinity of this factor for potential origins. This novel model quantitatively and robustly accounted for the observed changes in initiation rate and fork density. Conclusions/Significance This work provides a refined temporal profile of replication initiation rates and a robust, dynamic model that quantitatively explains replication origin usage during early embryonic S phase. These results have significant implications for the organisation of replication origins in higher eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2034993049,"The ATPase cycle of the chaperone Hsc70 is regulated by co-chaperones; Hsp40/DnaJ-related proteins stimulate ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 and can bind unfolded polypeptides themselves. Conversely, various nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) stimulate ADP-ATP exchange by Hsc70. We analyzed the purified Hsp40-related co-chaperones DJA1 (Hdj2) and DJA2 (Hdj3) and found that they had a distinct pattern of binding to a range of polypeptides. DJA2 alone could stimulate Hsc70-mediated refolding of luciferase in the absence of NEF, whereas DJA1 was much less active. The addition of the Bag1 NEF increased refolding by Hsc70 and DJA2, as did the newly characterized NEF Hsp110, but each NEF had a different optimal concentration ratio to Hsc70. Notably, the NEF HspBP1 could not increase refolding by Hsc70 and DJA2 at any concentration, and none of the NEFs improved the refolding activity with DJA1. Instead, DJA1 was inhibitory of refolding with DJA2 and Hsc70. All combinations of DJA1 or DJA2 with the three NEFs stimulated the Hsc70 ATPase rate, although Hsp110 became less effective with increasing concentrations. A chimeric DJA2 having its Hsc70-stimulatory J domain replaced with that of DJA1 was functional for polypeptide binding and ATPase stimulation of Hsc70. However, it could not support efficient Hsc70-mediated refolding and also inhibited refolding with DJA2 and Hsc70.

These results suggest a more complex model of Hsc70 mechanism than has been previously thought, with notable functional divergence between Hsc70 co-chaperones. The Hsp70 family of proteins are ATP-dependent molecular chaperones that assist the folding of polypeptides. Hsp70 chaperones have a typical structure divided into ATPase and substrate-binding domains that work in an ATP-driven substrate binding cycle. The mechanism of Hsp70 proteins has been well established in studies of the Escherichia coli homolog DnaK. In the ATP-bound state, an Hsp70 chaperone has low affinity for unfolded polypeptide. After hydrolysis of ATP, Hsp70 in the ADP-bound state binds substrate with high affinity. Exchange of ADP for ATP then reverts Hsp70 to its low polypeptide affinity state. Conversion of an Hsp70 between these two nucleotide states is controlled by different co-chaperone proteins. The Hsp40/DnaJ-related co-chaperones, including E. coli DnaJ, contain J domains that stimulate ATP hydrolysis by Hsp70, and consequently substrate binding. Nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs), 2The abbreviations used are: NEF, nucleotide exchange factor; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocator; CiC, citrate carrier; ERα, estrogen receptor α; GR, glucocorticoid receptor α isoform; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor; OGC, oxaloglutarate carrier; PiC, inorganic phosphate carrier; PR, progesterone receptor; RL, reticulocyte lysate. 2The abbreviations used are: NEF, nucleotide exchange factor; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocator; CiC, citrate carrier; ERα, estrogen receptor α; GR, glucocorticoid receptor α isoform; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor; OGC, oxaloglutarate carrier; PiC, inorganic phosphate carrier; PR, progesterone receptor; RL, reticulocyte lysate. such as GrpE in E. coli, trigger the dissociation of bound ADP from Hsp70 to allow the binding of ATP, resetting the cycle. The principles of this mechanism appear to be conserved in Hsp70 chaperones, including the major cytosolic form in humans, Hsc70 (HSPA8) (1.Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar, 2.Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The DnaJ-related co-chaperones are also conserved between species. Type 1 J domain co-chaperones are homologous to DnaJ throughout their sequence and have the same domain architecture. Following their N-terminal J domains, they contain a linker sequence, zinc finger and central regions, and a C-terminal homodimerization region. Unfolded polypeptides are thought to be bound by the central region of these proteins; substrates are transferred to the Hsp70 partner upon J domain activation of ATP hydrolysis by the Hsp70 (1.Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar, 3.Qiu X.B. Shao Y.M. Miao S. Wang L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2560-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Although DnaJ is the only J domain co-chaperone of E. coli DnaK, humans have three cytosolic type 1 co-chaperones: DJA1 (DNAJA1, Hdj2, HSDJ), DJA2 (DNAJA2, Hdj3, HIRIP4), and DJA4 (DNAJA4, Hdj4). Comparison with the type 1 co-chaperone Ydj1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests that the human DJAs will have similar overall structures. DJA1 and DJA2 are constitutively expressed, whereas DJA4 is less highly expressed and may be specialized. In addition, eukaryotic type 2 J domain co-chaperones are known that diverge from DnaJ in the substrate-binding and C-terminal regions. The human type 2 member DJB1 (Hsp40, Hdj1) is expressed at low levels under normal conditions and is mainly expressed in the heat shock stress response. DJB1 also binds substrate more weakly than type 1 co-chaperones. Thus, the DJA1 and DJA2 co-chaperones are thought to be the major partners of human Hsc70 (3.Qiu X.B. Shao Y.M. Miao S. Wang L.

Our recent work proposed a partial specialization between the human type 1 co-chaperones, perhaps to allow assistance of a wider range of substrates (11.Bhangoo M.K. Tzankov S. Fan A.C. Dejgaard K. Thomas D.Y. Young J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3414-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the NEF co-chaperones are divergent between E. coli and humans. The three types of human NEFs: Bag domain proteins, HspBP1, and Hsp110, are structurally unrelated to each other and to the single E. coli NEF GrpE. The C-terminal domain of Bag1 (C-Bag) was the first shown to have NEF activity for Hsc70, and homologous Bag domains have since been identified in several other human proteins. The mechanical action of C-Bag on Hsc70 appears to be equivalent to that of GrpE on DnaK, despite the difference in NEF structure (12.Hohfeld J. Jentsch S.

The structural effect of HspBP1 on Hsc70 is distinct from that of C-Bag (17.Kabani M. McLellan C. Raynes D.A. Guerriero V. Brodsky J.L.

Hsp110 represents a subclass of proteins structurally related to Hsp70; however, its ATPase activity and substrate binding are minimal. The Bag domain and HspBP1 NEFs are also thought to not bind substrate. A recent structural study suggests a large conformation shift within Hsp110 may be involved in its NEF function (20.Oh H.J.

Although the biochemical mechanisms of these NEFs have been recently revealed, little is known of the biological difference between them. The important question of how Hsc70 mechanically assists polypeptide folding is still under investigation. Studies of the E. coli DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE system have provided the outline of a model (1.Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar, 28.Szabo A. Langer T. Schroder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Increases in the steady-state ATPase rate of DnaK require both DnaJ and GrpE to promote the ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange steps. However, refolding of the model polypeptide luciferase is optimal at a particular ratio of DnaK to DnaJ and GrpE and, by implication, at the ATPase rate supported by that ratio. At this rate, the balance between nucleotide-dependent polypeptide binding and release by Hsc70 appears to be optimal for substrate folding. Other factors may be the binding of polypeptide by DnaJ and its transfer to DnaK. The multiple DJAs and NEFs of human Hsc70 provide a fresh opportunity to examine this model. In the simplest formulation, an optimal Hsc70 ATPase rate for refolding should be supported by different co-chaperone combinations. The functions of DJA1 and DJA2 have been compared together with Hsc70 and the Bag1 NEF (6.Terada K. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24728-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) but not with HspBP1 or Hsp110. We have reported that DJA1 was significantly less active than DJA2 in promoting the Hsc70- and C-Bag-mediated refolding of luciferase, although both had polypeptide binding and ATPase stimulatory properties (11.Bhangoo M.K.

Conversely, HspBP1 and Hsp110 have only been analyzed in combination with the biologically less relevant DJB1/Hsp40, like most data on Bag1 (13.Luders J. Demand J. Papp O. Hohfeld J. J. Biol.

We therefore carried out a systematic analysis of the major DJA1 and DJA2 co-chaperones with Hsc70 and the Bag1, HspBP1, and Hsp110 NEFs. Reagents and Proteins—Unless stated otherwise, all chemical reagents were from Sigma or BioShop Canada Inc. (Mississauga, Canada). Restriction enzymes and other recombinant DNA reagents were from New England Biolabs, Invitrogen, and Stratagene. Untreated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RL) was from Green Hectares (Oregon, WI) and desalted into buffer G (100 mm KOAc, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgOAc2) on a Hi-Prep 26/10 Fast Desalting column (GE Healthcare). His-tagged human DJA1, DJA2, DJA4, Hsc70, and C-Bag were expressed in Rosetta 2 E. coli cells (Novagen) and purified as described (11.Bhangoo M.K. Tzankov S. Fan A.C. Dejgaard K. Thomas D.Y.

They were purified by chromatography on nickel-Sepharose HP (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, and eluted with 300 mm imidazole and 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, and then on a Mono Q 5/50 GL (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mm NaCl and 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, and eluted with a 50 to 600 mm NaCl gradient. HspBP1 was dialyzed into buffer G, and Hsp110 was further purified on a Superdex 200 Hi-Load 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer G. DNA encoding the chimeric mutant DJA1–2 containing amino acids 1–95 of DJA1 and 96–412 of DJA2 was constructed by overlapping PCR and inserted into pPROEXHTa (Invitrogen), and the protein was purified similarly to DJA2. Where indicated, His tags were removed by digestion with His-tagged TEV protease 4 °C overnight followed by repurification on nickel-Sepharose. Polypeptide Binding—Binding of various polypeptides to DJA1, DJA2, and DJA4 was tested as described (11.Bhangoo M.K. Tzankov S. Fan A.C. Dejgaard K. Thomas D.Y. Young J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3414-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding bovine phosphate carrier A (PiC) and mouse adenine nucleotide carrier 2 (ANT) were as described (29.Fan A.C. Bhangoo M.K. Young J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33313-33324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); those for rat citrate carrier (CiC) and bovine oxaloglutarate carrier (OGC) were from Vincenzo Zara (Lecce, Italy); those for human glucocorticoid receptor (GR), estrogen receptor α (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR), and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) were from Theo Rein (Munich, Germany); and those for human cytochrome b5 and synaptobrevin 2 were from Stephen High (Manchester, UK). Purified DJA1, DJA2, and DJA4 were prebound on nickel-Sepharose in buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgOAc2 for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell-free translations of the various polypeptides were performed with the TnT-coupled RL system with SP6 or T7 polymerase (Promega) supplemented with [35S]methionine (GE Healthcare and PerkinElmer Life Sciences), diluted 1:20 into buffer G containing 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2 mg/ml ovalbumin, and added to the immobilized DJA proteins. The final reactions contained 5 μm wild-type DJA protein and 5% translation mixture. After 5 min at room temperature, the binding reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.1 unit/μl apyrase. The protein complexes were recovered at 4 °C for 30 min and washed with buffer G containing 20 mm imidazole and 0.1% Triton X-100. The protein complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging quantitation. Hsc70 Activation—Hsc70 activation by the co-chaperones was tested as described (11.Bhangoo M.K. Tzankov S. Fan A.C. Dejgaard K. Thomas D.Y. Young J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3414-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To assay polypeptide refolding, firefly luciferase (Sigma) was denatured in buffer G containing 6 m guanidinium-HCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at room temperature. Refolding reactions were preassembled on ice, containing 4 μm Hsc70 and the indicated amounts of purified co-chaperones in buffer G supplemented with 39 mm NaCl and 2 mm ATP. Luciferase was diluted 1:100 into reactions to a final concentration of 5.4 nm and incubated at 30 °C. Control reactions contained 70% RL in the same buffer or treated with 0.1 unit/μl apyrase as a negative control. At the 60 min or indicated time point, the aliquots were diluted 2:25 into luciferase assay reagent (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured in an EG&G Berthold Lumat LB 9507 luminometer. To test the ATPase activity of Hsc70, the reactions were preassembled on ice as described for the refolding assays, except that they were supplemented with 5 μCi/ml [α-32P]ATP (Perkin Elmer) in addition to 2 mm ATP, and the reactions were initiated by incubation at 30 °C. At various time points, the aliquots were removed and terminated with 37.5 mm EDTA. The samples were separated by thin layer chromatography on polyethylene-imine cellulose (Mallinckrodt Baker) developed in 0.5 m LiCl and 0.5 m formic acid. The ADP produced was determined by phosphorimaging quantitation, and the linear enzymatic rates (Vmax) were calculated by regression analysis. Polypeptide Binding by DJAs—DJA1 and DJA2, as well as DJA4, are homologous to each other in their J domains and their central polypeptide-binding regions. However, sequence divergence between DJA1 and DJA2 (55% identity, 69% similarity) is almost as high as between each of them and Ydj1 (46–47% identity, 63–65% similarity), which would suggest functional differences between DJA1 and DJA2. These proteins were previously compared in their binding of two mitochondrial preproteins, which depend on the Hsc70-Hsp90 chaperone system for their targeting (11.Bhangoo M.K. Tzankov S. Fan A.C. Dejgaard K. Thomas D.Y. Young J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3414-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29.Fan A.C. Bhangoo M.K. Young J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33313-33324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). DJA1 bound the PiC and ANT ∼2-fold better than DJA2, and DJA4 bound ANT better than PiC. To obtain a more complete picture of DJA substrate binding characteristics, a wider range of polypeptides, which were potential chaperone substrates, was examined. The mitochondrial CiC and OGC, like PiC and ANT, belong to the structural family of metabolite transporters of the mitochondrial inner membrane. They all have six transmembrane domains and remain unfolded before insertion into the membrane (30.de Marcos-Lousa C. Sideris D.P. Tokatlidis K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 259-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CiC and OGC preproteins also show involvement of the chaperone-Tom70 pathway in their mitochondrial import (31.Palmisano A. Zara V. Honlinger A. Vozza A. Dekker P.J. Pfanner N. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32.Zara V. Ferramosca A. Palmisano I. Palmieri F. Rassow J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast to the mitochondrial preproteins, the steroid hormone receptors are cytosolic and nuclear. Several of these proteins, including GR, ERα, PR and MR, respectively, are known to depend on the Hsc70-Hsp90 system to maintain them in a hormone-activable state (33.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 34.Picard D. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Their hormone-binding domains appear to be the main chaperone binding sites and may be conformationally unstable in the absence of hormone. Certain transmembrane tail-anchored proteins such as synaptobrevin 2 are also assisted by Hsc70 during their insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Other tail-anchored proteins such as cytochrome b5 appear to be less dependent on chaperones for insertion (35.Abell B.M. Rabu C. Leznicki P. Young J.C. High S. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1743-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The binding of the above polypeptides by the purified DJAs was therefore tested with our previously established method (11.Bhangoo M.K. Tzankov S. Fan A.C. Dejgaard K. Thomas D.Y. Young J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3414-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The various polypeptides were radiolabeled by cell-free translation in rabbit RL, a standard model cytosol for chaperone experiments. The labeled polypeptides were then co-precipitated with purified His-tagged DJA1, DJA2, or DJA4 and nickel-Sepharose. The existing chaperones in the RL compete for substrate binding with the DJAs but also help maintain solubility of the substrates; the radiolabeling allows accurate quantitation of the bound polypeptides by phosphorimaging analysis. The amount of bound polypeptide relative to input labeled material was determined, and the binding between the co-chaperones was compared. Substrate binding by DJA1, DJA2, and DJA4 relative to input is shown in Fig. 1. More CiC and OGC were bound by DJA1 than the established preprotein substrate PiC, over 80% of input in the case of OGC (Fig. 1). The amounts of steroid hormone receptors bound by DJA1 varied widely: 16% relative to input for PR, 25% for GR, 49% for ERα, and 66% for MR. The tail-anchored proteins cytochrome b5 and synaptobrevin 2 were bound poorly by DJA1, at less than 6% of input and close to background binding by the nickel-Sepharose control. So, the interaction of the mitochondrial preproteins and steroid hormone receptors with DJA1 seems to vary between the different proteins, whereas the tail-anchored proteins are bound poorly by DJA1. Polypeptide binding by DJA2 and DJA4 was next analyzed. As observed before, PiC binding by DJA2 was approximately half that by DJA1, and binding of CiC and OGC by DJA2 was now also observed at approximately half relative to DJA1 binding, respectively (Fig. 1). DJA2 binding of GR and ERα was more similar to DJA1. Binding of PR by DJA2 was quite low, whereas binding of MR was essentially identical to DJA1. Very little cytochrome b5 and synaptobrevin 2 was bound by DJA2. In comparison, DJA4 binding also showed variation in the same range. Binding by DJA4 was comparable with DJA1 for CiC and OGC and progressively weaker for MR and ERα. GR and PR were bound most weakly by DJA4 at approximately one-fourth of DJA1 binding. Thus, the substrate binding profiles of DJA1 and DJA2 are clearly different. Overall, DJA1 shows moderately stronger binding of these polypeptides, but with exceptions (PR and MR). DJA4 may be more similar to DJA1 in its profile, although exceptions are also observed (GR and PR). The differences in binding are significant but mostly range within an order of magnitude. This is consistent with our proposed idea of partial specialization between the DJA co-chaperones. Polypeptide Refolding by Hsc70, DJA2, and NEFs—We recently reported that DJA2 was quite active in supporting the refolding of chemically denatured luciferase by purified Hsc70, whereas DJA1 had very poor activity (11.Bhangoo M.K. Tzankov S. Fan A.C. Dejgaard K. Thomas D.Y. Young J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3414-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Those experiments were performed using 4 μm Hsc70, 4 μm of either DJA1 or DJA2, and 0.5 μm of the Bag1 NEF domain (C-Bag) (13.Luders J. Demand J. Papp O. Hohfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14817-14823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14.Sondermann H. Scheufler C. Schneider C. Hohfeld J. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Science. 2001; 291: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The 8:1 ratio of Hsc70 to NEF had been thought to be optimal for Hsc70-mediated refolding, as well as for the E. coli DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE system (6.Terada K. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24728-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To compare DJA refolding functions with different NEFs, we first tested refolding in the absence of any NEF. The model cytosol RL was used as a positive control. Luciferase was denatured in guanidine and rapidly diluted 1:100 to 5.4 nm in RL or reactions containing purified proteins, supplemented with 2 mm ATP, and refolding at 30 °C was monitored by the luciferase enzymatic activity (11.Bhangoo M.K. Tzankov S. Fan A.C. Dejgaard K. Thomas D.Y. Young J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3414-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As expected, RL provided efficient refolding of luciferase, whereas 4 μm Hsc70 alone could not (Fig. 2A). Remarkably, 4 μm Hsc70 and 4 μm DJA2 was relatively effective at refolding, to above 70% of the RL control by 60 min. This suggested that unlike for DnaK, an NEF may not be stringently required for Hsc70 function when an appropriate DJA partner is available. Consistent with earlier results, an equivalent amount of Hsc70 and DJA1 was inactive in refolding. Although an NEF may not be absolutely required for the Hsc70-DJA2 pair, it may still improve the efficiency of the refolding reaction. An increase in refolding of thermally denatured and in some cases chemically denatured luciferase had been reported for Bag1 and Hsp110 together with Hsc70 and DJB1/Hsp40 (13.Luders J. Demand J. Papp O. Hohfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14817-14823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23.Dragovic Z. Broadley S.A. Shomura Y. Bracher A. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2519-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Therefore, chemically denatured luciferase refolding was tested with 4 μm Hsc70 and DJA2 as above, but with increasing concentrations of the C-Bag, HspBP1 and Hsp110 NEFs. The levels of refolding after 60 min relative to that of the Hsc70 and DJA2 control reaction without NEF was plotted (Fig. 2, B–D). Increasing amounts of C-Bag produced a moderate but significant increase in refolding that peaked at 1.24-fold above Hsc70 and DJA2 alone (Fig. 2B). The optimal C-Bag concentration for refolding was at 4 μm, equimolar to Hsc70 and DJA2. 21 μm inhibited refolding to ∼0.4 of the Hsc70-DJA2 control. HspBP1 had a very different behavior. Increasing HspBP1 amounts did not increase refolding by Hsc70-DJA2 at all, but progressively inhibited refolding to ∼0.6 of the control (Fig. 2C). For Hsp110, the result was different again. 1 μm Hsp110 significantly raised refolding to 1.20-fold of the control (Fig. 2D), similar to the maximum effect of C-Bag. Higher levels of Hsp110 clearly inhibited refolding, to less than 0.5 of the control at 8 μm and above. To confirm these results, the time course of luciferase refolding at optimal concentrations of C-Bag (4 μm) and Hsp110 (1 μm) with Hsc70 and DJA2 was examined. The increase in refolding compared with H"

The aim of the present study was to test the role of motor representations in the visual perception of peripersonal space. Methodology Seven healthy participants underwent a TMS study while performing a right-left decision (control) task or perceptually judging whether a visual target was reachable or not with their right hand. An actual grasping movement task was also included. Single pulse TMS was delivered 80% of the trials on the left motor and premotor cortex and on a control site (the temporo-occipital area), at 90% of the resting motor threshold and at different SOA conditions (50ms, 100ms, 200ms or 300ms). Principal Findings Results showed a facilitation effect of the TMS on reaction times in all tasks, whatever the site stimulated and until 200ms after stimulus presentation. However, the facilitation effect was on average 34ms lower when stimulating the motor cortex in the perceptual judgement task, especially for stimuli located at the boundary of peripersonal space. Conclusion This study provides the first evidence that brain motor area participate in the visual determination of what is reachable. We discuss how motor representations may feed the perceptual system with information about possible interactions with nearby objects and thus may contribute to the perception of the boundary of peripersonal space."
https://openalex.org/W2128605318,"In order to begin to study the structural and functional mechanisms of olfactory receptors, methods for milligram-scale purification are required. Here we demonstrate the production and expression of a synthetically engineered human olfactory receptor hOR17-4 gene in a stable tetracycline-inducible mammalian cell line (HEK293S). The olfactory receptor gene was fabricated from scratch using PCR-based gene-assembly, which facilitated codon optimization and attachment of a 9-residue bovine rhodopsin affinity tag for detection and purification. Induction of adherent cultures with tetracycline together with sodium butyrate led to hOR17-4 expression levels of ∼30 µg per 150 mm tissue culture plate. Fos-choline-based detergents proved highly capable of extracting the receptors, and fos-choline-14 (N-tetradecylphosphocholine) was selected for optimal solubilization and subsequent purification. Analysis by SDS-PAGE revealed both monomeric and dimeric receptor forms, as well as higher MW oligomeric species. A two-step purification method of immunoaffinity and size exclusion chromatography was optimized which enabled 0.13 milligrams of hOR17-4 monomer to be obtained at >90% purity. This high purity of hOR17-4 is not only suitable for secondary structural and functional analyses but also for subsequent crystallization trials. Thus, this system demonstrates the feasibility of purifying milligram quantities of the GPCR membrane protein hOR17-4 for fabrication of olfactory receptor-based bionic sensing device."

https://openalex.org/W2122634043,"During normal development oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs) are generated in the ventral spinal cord in response to Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signalling. There is also a second, late wave of oligodendrogenesis in the dorsal spinal cord independent of Shh activity. Two signalling pathways, controlled by bone morphogenetic protein and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), are active players in dorsal spinal cord specification. In particular, BMP signalling from the roof plate has a crucial role in setting up dorsal neural identity and its inhibition is sufficient to generate OPCs both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, FGF signalling can induce OPC production from dorsal spinal cord cultures in vitro. In this study, we examined the cross-talk between mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and BMP signalling in embryonic dorsal spinal cord cultures at the SMAD1/5/8 (SMAD1) transcription factor level, the main effectors of BMP activity. We have previously shown that FGF2 treatment of neural precursor cells (NPCs) derived from rat E14 dorsal spinal cord is sufficient to generate OPCs in vitro. Utilising the same system, we now show that FGF prevents BMP-induced nuclear localisation of SMAD1-phosphorylated at the C-terminus (C-term-pSMAD1). This nuclear exclusion of C-term-pSMAD1 is dependent on MAPK activity and correlates with OLIG2 upregulation, the obligate transcription factor for oligodendrogenesis. Furthermore, inhibition of the MAPK pathway abolishes OLIG2 expression. We also show that SMAD4, which acts as a common partner for receptor-regulated Smads including SMAD1, associates with a Smad binding site in the Olig2 promoter and dissociates from it upon differentiation. Taken together, these results suggest that FGF can promote OPC generation from embryonic NPCs by counteracting BMP signalling at the Smad1 transcription factor level and that Smad-containing transcriptional complexes may be involved in direct regulation of the Olig2 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1997038243,"Regulation of global chromatin acetylation is important for chromatin remodeling. A small family of Jade proteins includes Jade-1L, Jade-2, and Jade-3, each bearing two mid-molecule tandem plant homology domain (PHD) zinc fingers. We previously demonstrated that the short isoform of Jade-1L protein, Jade-1, is associated with endogenous histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. It has been found that Jade-1L/2/3 proteins co-purify with a novel HAT complex, consisting of HBO1, ING4/5, and Eaf6. We investigated a role for Jade-1/1L in the HBO1 complex. When overexpressed individually, neither Jade-1/1L nor HBO1 affected histone acetylation. However, co-expression of Jade-1/1L and HBO1 increased acetylation of the bulk of endogenous histone H4 in epithelial cells in a synergistic manner, suggesting that Jade1/1L positively regulates HBO1 HAT activity. Conversely, small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of endogenous Jade resulted in reduced levels of H4 acetylation. Moreover, HBO1-mediated H4 acetylation activity was enhanced severalfold by the presence of Jade-1/1L in vitro. The removal of PHD fingers affected neither binding nor mutual Jade-1-HBO1 stabilization but completely abrogated the synergistic Jade-1/1L- and HBO1-mediated histone H4 acetylation in live cells and in vitro with reconstituted oligonucleosome substrates. Therefore, PHDs are necessary for Jade-1/1L-induced acetylation of nucleosomal histones by HBO1. In contrast to Jade-1/1L, the PHD zinc finger protein ING4/5 failed to synergize with HBO1 to promote histone acetylation. The physical interaction of ING4/5 with HBO1 occurred in the presence of Jade-1L or Jade-3 but not with the Jade-1 short isoform. In summary, this study demonstrates that Jade-1/1L are crucial co-factors for HBO1-mediated histone H4 acetylation."

However, replication has been contradictory for both variants. The aims of this study were to validate these obesity-associations through case-control studies and analyses of obesity-related quantitative traits. Moreover, since environmental and genetic factors may modulate the impact of a genetic variant, we wanted to perform such interaction analyses. We focused on physical activity as an environmental risk factor, and on the GWA identified obesity variants in FTO (rs9939609) and near MC4R (rs17782313) as genetic risk factors.The four variants were genotyped in a combined study sample comprising a total of 18,014 subject ascertained from, the population-based Inter99 cohort (n = 6,514), the ADDITION screening cohort (n = 8,662), a population-based study sample (n = 680) and a type 2 diabetic patient group (n = 2,158) from Steno Diabetes Center.No association with overweight, obesity or obesity-related measures was shown for either the INSIG2 rs7566605 or the PFKP rs6602024 variants. However, an interaction between the INSIG2 rs7566605 variant and the level of self-reported physical activity (p(Int) = 0.004) was observed. A BMI difference of 0.53 (SE 0.42) kg/m(2) was found when comparing physically passive homozygous C-allele carriers with physically passive G-allele carriers. No interactions between the two variants and FTO rs9939609 and MC4R rs17782313 were observed.The INSIG2 rs7566605 and PFKP rs6602024 polymorphisms play no apparent role in the development of common forms of obesity in the Danish population. However, if replicated, the INSIG2 rs7566605 may influence the level of BMI in combination with the level of physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W2090692916,"Plant biomechanical design is central to cell shape, morphogenesis, reproductive performance and protection against environmental and mechanical stress. The cell wall forms the central load bearing support structure for plant design, yet a mechanistic understanding of its synthesis is incomplete. A key tool for studying the structure of cellulose polymorphs has been x-ray diffraction and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Relative crystallinity index (RCI) is based on the x-ray diffraction characteristics of two signature peaks and we used this technique to probe plant assembly, adaptation and acclimation. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize the dynamics of cellulose synthase in transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing a homozygous YFP::CESA6. Assembly: RCI values for stems and roots were indistinguishable but leaves had 23.4 and 21.6% lower RCI than stems and roots respectively. Adaptation: over 3-fold variability in RCI was apparent in leaves from 35 plant species spanning Ordovician to Cretaceous periods. Within this study, RCI correlated positively with leaf geometric constraints and with mass per unit area, suggestive of allometry. Acclimation: biomass crystallinity was found to decrease under conditions of thigmomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis. Further, in etiolated pea hypocotyls, RCI values also decreased compared to plants that were grown in light, consistent with alterations in FTIR cellulose fingerprint peaks and live cell imaging experiments revealing rapid orientation of the YFP::cellulose synthase-6 array in response to light. Herein, results and technical challenges associated with the structure of the cell wall that gives rise to sample crystallinity are presented and examined with respect to adaptation, acclimation and assembly in ecosystem-level processes."

We present a new survey methodology that is based on sound epidemiological principles and is linked to the World Health Organisation's International Classification of Functioning.Clusters were selected with probability proportionate to size. Households were selected within clusters through compact segment sampling. 105 clusters of 80 people (all ages) were included. All participants were screened for MSI by a physiotherapist and medical assistant. Possible cases plus a random sample of 10% of non-MSI cases were examined further to ascertain diagnosis, aetiology, quality of life, and treatment needs.6757 of 8368 enumerated individuals (80.8%) were screened. There were 352 cases, giving an overall prevalence for MSI of 5.2%. (95% CI 4.5-5.9) The prevalence of MSI increased with age and was similar in men and women. Extrapolating these estimates, there are approximately 488,000 MSI diagnoses in Rwanda. Only 8.2% of MSI cases were severe, while the majority were moderate (43.7%) or mild (46.3%). Diagnostic categories comprised 11.5% congenital, 31.3% trauma, 3.8% infection, 9.0% neurological, and 44.4% non-traumatic non infective acquired. The most common individual diagnoses were joint disease (13.3%), angular limb deformity (9.7%) and fracture mal- and non-union (7.2%). 96% of all cases required further treatment.This survey demonstrates a large burden of MSI in Rwanda, which is mostly untreated. The survey methodology will be useful in other low income countries, to assist with planning services and monitoring trends."
https://openalex.org/W1988009825,"Background Our recent discovery of the substituted cyclobutane Boc5, one of the first non-peptidic agonists at glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors, offers the potential of combining oral availability with full agonism capable of eliciting antidiabetic and antiobesity effects. The present study was aimed at determining the in vivo pharmacologic properties of Boc5 in both normal and diabetic mice following chronic administration, with emphasis on glycemic control and weight loss. Methodology/Principal Findings C57BL/6J and db/db mice were treated daily with Boc5 for 4 weeks and a range of pharmacologic parameters, including hemoglobin A1c, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance, fasting insulin and leptin levels, food intake, body weight and fat mass, were assessed before and after the treatment. Effects on food intake, gastric emptying, and insulinogenic index were also investigated in animals acutely administered with Boc5. Boc5 (3 mg) was able to induce a durable restoration of glycemic control (normalization of both hemoglobin A1c and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance) in db/db mice, following 4 weeks of daily administration. As with peptidic glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, its glycemic benefit and weight (fat) loss were associated with dose-dependent effects that included reduction in food intake, slowing of gastric emptying (both of which reduce nutrient-drive at β-cells), stimulation of insulin secretion (which was glucose-dependent), and elevation in insulin sensitivity. There was little effect on normal mice treated in the same manner. Conclusions/Significance Our findings suggest that Boc5 is the only non-peptidic molecule reported thus far to simultaneously activate this spectrum of antidiabetic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2072260031,"The differentiation and proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) are regulated by a combination of their intrinsic properties (e.g., transcription factors, epigenetic factors, and microRNA regulation) and cell-extrinsic properties from the microenvironment around NSC (e.g., cytokines, growth factors, and cell-cell contact). Recently, there has been a great interest in clarifying the mechanism of the influence of the microenvironment on NSCs, especially cell-cell contact between NSCs and other types of cells nearby. In this study, we investigated whether microglial (Mi) cells influence the fate of NSCs. Coculture study showed that ramified Mi cells promoted astrogliogenesis and maintenance of NSCs through their paracrine effects. This microglia-induced astrogliogenesis was inhibited by AG490 and by overexpression of the dominant-negative form of Stat3 and SOCS3. Promoter assay revealed transactivation of Stat3 function in NSCs by Mi cells. Gene expression study revealed that mRNA of Notch family members (notch1-3) and sox9 in NSCs was significantly upregulated by Mi cells, and this up-regulation was inhibited by AG490. These results demonstrated that ramified Mi cells promoted astrogliogenesis and maintenance of NSCs by activating Stat3 function and via notch and sox9 signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2004056508,"Background In a previously published study, we found that large differentiated subpopulations of CD8 T-cells emerged rapidly after CMV infection in young infants and persisted throughout the following year. Here we describe a follow-up study conducted on the same infants to establish whether the differentiated subpopulations continued through the second year post-infection. Methodology / Principal Findings CMV-specific cells identified using tetramers remained more activated and differentiated than the overall CD8 population. The large subpopulation of differentiated cytotoxic (CD28−CD62L−Bcl-2lowCD95+perforin+) cells that emerged rapidly after infection remained stable after two years. No similar subpopulation was found in CMV-uninfected infants indicating that two years after infection, CMV remained a major factor in driving CD8 T-cell differentiation. Although markers of activation (CD45R0 and HLA-D) declined throughout the first year, HLA-D expression continued to decline during the second year and CD45R0 expression increased slightly. The age-related increase in IFNγ response observed during the first year continued but was non-significant during the second year, indicating that the rate of functional improvement had slowed substantially. Conclusions / Significance The large differentiated subpopulations of CD8 T-cells that had emerged immediately after CMV infection persisted through the second year post-infection, while levels of activation and functional capacity remained fairly constant."
https://openalex.org/W2044265042,"Intranuclear crystalline inclusions have been observed in the nucleus of epithelial cells infected with Adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) at late steps of the virus life cycle. Using immuno-electron microscopy and confocal microscopy of cells infected with various Ad5 recombinants modified in their penton base or fiber domains, we found that these inclusions represented crystals of penton capsomers, the heteromeric capsid protein formed of penton base and fiber subunits. The occurrence of protein crystals within the nucleus of infected cells required the integrity of the fiber knob and part of the shaft domain. In the knob domain, the region overlapping residues 489-492 in the FG loop was found to be essential for crystal formation. In the shaft, a large deletion of repeats 4 to 16 had no detrimental effect on crystal inclusions, whereas deletion of repeats 8 to 21 abolished crystal formation without altering the level of fiber protein expression. This suggested a crucial role of the five penultimate repeats in the crystallisation process. Chimeric pentons made of Ad5 penton base and fiber domains from different serotypes were analyzed with respect to crystal formation. No crystal was found when fiber consisted of shaft (S) from Ad5 and knob (K) from Ad3 (heterotypic S5-K3 fiber), but occurred with homotypic S3K3 fiber. However, less regular crystals were observed with homotypic S35-K35 fiber. TB5, a monoclonal antibody directed against the Ad5 fiber knob was found by immunofluorescence microscopy to react with high efficiency with the intranuclear protein crystals in situ. Data obtained with Ad fiber mutants indicated that the absence of crystalline inclusions correlated with a lower infectivity and/or lower yields of virus progeny, suggesting that the protein crystals might be involved in virion assembly. Thus, we propose that TB5 staining of Ad-infected 293 cells can be used as a prognostic assay for the viability and productivity of fiber-modified Ad5 vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2156600129,"A continuous periodic motion stimulus can sometimes be perceived moving in the wrong direction. These illusory reversals have been taken as evidence that part of the motion perception system samples its inputs as a series of discrete snapshots –although other explanations of the phenomenon have been proposed, that rely on the spurious activation of low-level motion detectors in early visual areas. We have hypothesized that the right inferior parietal lobe (‘when’ pathway) plays a critical role in timing perceptual events relative to one another, and thus we examined the role of the right parietal lobe in the generation of this “continuous Wagon Wheel Illusion” (c-WWI). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the illusion was effectively weakened following disruption of right, but not left, parietal regions by low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (1 Hz, 10 min). These results were independent of whether the motion stimulus was shown in the left or the right visual field. Thus, the c-WWI appears to depend on higher-order attentional mechanisms that are supported by the ‘when’ pathway of the right parietal lobe."
https://openalex.org/W1982553713,"Polyadenylated, mRNA-like transcripts with no coding potential are abundant in eukaryotes, but the functions of these long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are enigmatic. In meiosis, Rec12 (Spo11) catalyzes the formation of dsDNA breaks (DSBs) that initiate homologous recombination. Most meiotic recombination is positioned at hotspots, but knowledge of the mechanisms is nebulous. In the fission yeast genome DSBs are located within 194 prominent peaks separated on average by 65-kbp intervals of DNA that are largely free of DSBs.We compared the genome-wide distribution of DSB peaks to that of polyadenylated ncRNA molecules of the prl class. DSB peaks map to ncRNA loci that may be situated within ORFs, near the boundaries of ORFs and intergenic regions, or most often within intergenic regions. Unconditional statistical tests revealed that this colocalization is non-random and robust (P<or=5.5 x 10(-8)). Furthermore, we tested and rejected the hypothesis that the ncRNA loci and DSB peaks localize preferentially, but independently, to a third entity on the chromosomes.Meiotic DSB hotspots are directed to loci that express polyadenylated ncRNAs. This reveals an unexpected, possibly unitary mechanism for what directs meiotic recombination to hotspots. It also reveals a likely biological function for enigmatic ncRNAs. We propose specific mechanisms by which ncRNA molecules, or some aspect of RNA metabolism associated with ncRNA loci, help to position recombination protein complexes at DSB hotspots within chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2064153475,"Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, encodes three cysteine homologues (Px I-III) of classical selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidases. The enzymes obtain their reducing equivalents from the unique trypanothione (bis(glutathionyl)spermidine)/tryparedoxin system. During catalysis, these tryparedoxin peroxidases cycle between an oxidized form with an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys(47) and Cys(95) and the reduced peroxidase with both residues in the thiol state. Here we report on the three-dimensional structures of oxidized T. brucei Px III at 1.4A resolution obtained by x-ray crystallography and of both the oxidized and the reduced protein determined by NMR spectroscopy. Px III is a monomeric protein unlike the homologous poplar thioredoxin peroxidase (TxP). The structures of oxidized and reduced Px III are essentially identical in contrast to what was recently found for TxP. In Px III, Cys(47), Gln(82), and Trp(137) do not form the catalytic triad observed in the selenoenzymes, and related proteins and the latter two residues are unaffected by the redox state of the protein. The mutational analysis of three conserved lysine residues in the vicinity of the catalytic cysteines revealed that exchange of Lys(107) against glutamate abrogates the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, whereas Lys(97) and Lys(99) play a crucial role in the interaction with tryparedoxin."
https://openalex.org/W2156848272,"Addicsin (Arl6ip5) is a murine homologue of rat glutamate transporter-associated protein 3-18 (GTRAP3-18), a putative negative modulator of Na+-dependent neural glutamate transporter-excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1).

Like addicsin, Arl6ip1 is expressed in numerous tissues and proved likely to be co-localized with addicsin in certain neurons in the matured brain. Arl6ip1 was not translocated from the subcellular compartments under any of the test conditions and had no association with any molecules on the plasma membrane. Immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that Arl6ip1 bound directly to addicsin and that the hydrophobic region located at amino acids 103–117 of addicsin was crucial to the formation of the Arl6ip1-addicsin heterodimer and addicsin homodimer. Glutamate transport assay revealed that increasing the expression of Arl6ip1 in C6BU-1 cells markedly enhanced Na+-dependent EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport activity in the presence of 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Under these conditions, kinetic analyses demonstrated that EAAC1 altered glutamate transport activity by increasing its glutamate affinity but not its maximal velocity. Meanwhile, increasing expression of addicsin Y110A/L112A mutant lacking binding ability for Arl6ip1 showed no enhancement of EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport activity, regardless of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate activation, suggesting that association between addicsin and Arl6ip1 causes altered EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport activity.

Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in excitatory synapses and the metabolic substrate for γ-aminobutyric acid synthesis in the inhibitory neurons in the mammalian central nervous system.

Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). EAATs can be classified into five different homologues, designated EAAT1 (glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST)), EAAT2 (glutamate trasnporter-2 (GLT-1)), EAAT3 (excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1)), EAAT4, or EAAT5 (2Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). In the CNS, GLAST and GLT-1 mainly localize to the astrocytes and play a major role in protecting neurons from glutamate-induced toxicity (3Rothstein J.D. Dykes-Hoberg M. Pardo C.A. Bristol L.A.

On the other hand, EAAC1 is widely expressed in the CNS and localizes in the somata and dendrites of certain neurons in the CNS (6Kanai Y. Bhide P.G. DiFiglia M.

However, recent studies demonstrate that EAAC1 acts as a cysteine transporter and maintains neuronal glutathione metabolism (11Aoyama K. Suh S.W. Hamby A.M. Liu J. Chan W.Y. Chen Y. Swanson R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and that EAAC1 has a unique mitochondria-mediated anti-apoptotic function in injured motor neurons (12Kiryu-Seo S. Gamo K. Tachibana T. Tanaka K. Kiyama H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3411-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Knock-out of EAAC1 in rodents leads to the development of epilepsy resulting from reduced synthesis of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (13Sepkuty J.P. Cohen A.S. Eccles C. Rafiq A. Behar K. Ganel R. Coulter D.A. Rothstein J.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6372-6379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), dicarboxylic aminoaciduria, and significant motor impairment (14Peghini P. Janzen J. Stoffel W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3822-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Changes in glutamate transport activity of EAAC1 are also associated with long term potentiation and fear conditioning (15Levenson J. Weeber E. Selcher J.C. Kategaya L.S. Sweatt J.D. Eskin A. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These pieces of evidence suggest that EAAC1 may contribute physiologically to multiple neurotic functions as distinct from glutamate clearance in the CNS. Furthermore, a number of reports demonstrate that intracellular signaling molecules and accessory proteins regulate the expression and function of EAAC1 (16Gonzalez M.I. Robinson M.B. Mol. Interv. 2004; 4: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For instance, protein kinase C (PKC) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulate the cell surface expression and intrinsic activity of EAAC1 (17Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, GTRAP3-18(glutamatetransporter-associated protein 3-18) negatively modulates EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport by protein-protein interaction with EAAC1 (18Lin C.I. Orlov I.

Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 2079-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The protein known in various papers as addicsin, GTRAP3-18, or JWA has recently been renamed Arl6ip5. Addicsin/GTRAP3-18 is widely distributed in various tissues, including the brain (19Ikemoto M.J. Inoue K. Akiduki S. Osugi T. Imamura T. Ishida N. Ohtomi M.

In the CNS, addicsin is predominantly expressed in the principal neurons of the mature brain such as the pyramidal cells and γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic interneurons scattered in the hippocampal formation (21Inoue K. Akiduki S. Ikemoto M.J. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 386: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 22Akiduki S. Ochiishi T. Ikemoto M.J. Neurosci. Lett. 2007; 426: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Addicsin is thought to be localized in intracellular compartments and implicated in intracellular trafficking events, because it is a member of the prenylated Rab acceptor 1 domain family, member 3 (PRAF3) (23Fo C.S. Coleman C.S. Wallick C.J. Vine A.L. Bachmann A.S. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 371: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, JWA, a human homologue of addicsin, is responsive to environmental oxidative stress, such as hydrogen peroxide (24Chen R. Qiu W. Liu Z. Cao X. Zhu T. Li A. Wei Q. Zhou J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 1704-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and is up-regulated in the thalamus in schizophrenia (25Huerta I. McCullumsmith R.E. Haroutunian V. Gimenez-Amaya J.M. Meador-Woodruff J.H. Synapse. 2006; 59: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These data clearly demonstrate that addicsin may play crucial roles in basic physiological functions in vivo. However, at present, the molecular functions of addicsin remain largely unknown. To gain further insights into this issue, we particularly focused on the evidence that addicsin/GTRAP3-18 tends to form a multimeric complex (18Lin C.I. Orlov I. Ruggiero A.M. Dykes-Hoberg M. Lee A.

Here, we report that ADP-ribosylation factor-like 6 interacting protein 1 (Arl6ip1) is an addicsin-associated partner and positively modulates EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport activity in a PKC-activity-dependent manner.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Male ddY mice (6 weeks old; 25–30 g in body weight; Japan SLC, Inc., Shizuoka, Japan) were maintained in individual cages (12-hour light-dark cycle; 23–24 °C) and used in the experiments.

The primers for Arl6ip1 were 5′-AAG AAT TCA TGG CGG AGG GGG ATA ACC GCA-3′ and 5′-TTC TCG AGC TCA TTT TTC TTT TCT TTT TGC-3′. The primers for addicsin were 5′-GCG GTA CCC TCG CGA AGC AGA GGA ACA T-3′ and 5′-AAG GGC CCC TCC CTC GCT TTG CTG ATG T-3′. The primers for EAAC1 were 5′-GCG GTA CCC ACC ATG GGG AAG CCC ACG AGC-3′ and 5′-AAG GGC CCG AAC TGT GAG GTC TGG GT GAAC-3′. The PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+)A (Invitrogen) and pcDNA3.1/FLAG-His(+)A (modified with pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+)A by M. J. Ikemoto), respectively. The addicsin mutants were produced by PCR amplification using pcDNA-addicsin-myc as the template and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+)A. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing prior to transfection.Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Matchmaker two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech) was used for the yeast two-hybrid screen. A full length of addicsin cDNA was subcloned into a bait vector, pGBKT7, by fusion with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The oligo(dT)-primed cDNAs prepared from the amygdala in repeated morphine-administered mice were subcloned into a prey vector, pACT2, by fusion with the GAL4 activation domain. These constructs were co-transfected into the yeast AH109 strain using the lithium acetate method. After the transformants had grown on tryptophan-, leucine-, and histidine-deficient plates (SD-TLH) containing 20 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal) (Clontech) at 30 °C, the resultant blue colonies were selected. The plasmids were isolated using Zymoprep (Zymo Research Corp., Orange, CA), and their cDNA sequences were then analyzed.Cell Culture and Transfection—C6BU-1 and COS7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (10% FBS-DMEM) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. NG108-15 cells were maintained in 10% FBS-DMEM containing 1× HAT supplement at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transient expression, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 and maintained for 48 h before the experiments. For creating a mifepristone-regulated expression system, C6BU-1 stable cell lines designated C6BU-1-pSw-Arl6ip1, C6BU-1-pSw-addicsin, and C6BU-1-pSw-addicsinY110A/L112A, respectively, were produced using the GeneSwitch System (Invitrogen). These cell lines were cultured in 10% FBS-DMEM containing 100 μg/ml Hyglomycin and 250 μg/ml Zeocin for dual selection and were exposed to 10 nm mifepristone for 24 h to express conditionally V5-tagged Arl6ip1 (Arl6ip1-V5), V5-tagged addicsin (addicsin-V5), and V5-tagged addicsinY110A/L112A (addicsinY110A/L112A-V5), respectively. Each basal transcription level was undetectable by Western blotting analysis using the anti-V5 monoclonal antibody.Western Blot Analysis—For distribution analysis, mouse brain S2 fractions were prepared as described previously (19Ikemoto M.J. Inoue K. Akiduki S. Osugi T. Imamura T. Ishida N. Ohtomi M. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 2079-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The S2 fractions (40 μg) suspended in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation assay, whole cell lysates were prepared by dissolving in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. The whole cell lysates (10 μl) were subjected to Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (16.5% T, 3% C) and then transferred to the polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. After the blots had been blocked with 10% dried milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), they were incubated with specific antibodies for the target proteins. After incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, specific signals were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (BD Biosciences).Immmunoprecipitation Assay—For in vitro immunoprecipitation assay, at 48 h after transfection using Lipofectamine 2000, NG108-15 or COS7 cells were dissolved in the RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture. Cell extracts were incubated with 0.1 volume of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel or anti-c-Myc affinity gel overnight at 4 °C. After washing five times with TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), gels were suspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to Western blotting. For in vivo immunoprecipitation assay, mouse whole brains were homogenized with a 10-fold volume of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% protease inhibitor). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant (250 μg/ml) was incubated with rabbit anti-Arl6ip1 serum or rabbit preimmune serum for overnight at 4 °C. The supernatant was further incubated with protein A-Sepharose for 1–2 h at 4 °C. After rinsing five times with the lysis buffer, the protein A-Sepharose was suspended in SDS sample buffer and then subjected to Western blotting.Glycerol Gradient Centrifugation Analysis—Glycerol gradient centrifugation analysis was carried out as described previously (26Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Arata Y. Mori S. Maeda M. Tanaka T. Yoshida M. Yoneda-Kato N. Kato J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2302-2310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). NG108-15 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA-Arl6ip1-FLAG and pcDNA-addicsin-myc using Lipofectamine 2000. At 24 h after transfection, cells were dissolved in RIPA buffer containing 0.1% protease inhibitor. 1 ml of cell lysate was layered onto 10 ml of a 10–40% linear glycerol gradient containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. After centrifugation for 24 h at 130,000 × g in a Hitachi RPS40T rotor at 4 °C, 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of each centrifugation tube. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody.Glutamate Transport Assay—The glutamate transport assay was performed as described previously (27Dowd L.A. Robinson M.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, C6BU-1-pSw-Arl6ip1, C6BU-1-pSw-addicsin, or C6BU-1-pSw-addicsin-Y110A/L112A cells were cultured on the PRIMARIA 24-well plate (BD Biosciences). After exposure to vehicle (2.2 mm ethanol) or 10 nm Mifepristone for 24 h at 37 °C, cells were further incubated in 10% FBS-DMEM supplemented with vehicle (1.3 mm DMSO) or 100 nm phorbol esters for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed three times with 500 μl of sodium- or choline-containing buffer maintained at 37 °C (5 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm K2HPO4, 10 mm glucose, 140 mm NaCl, or choline chloride) before incubation with 0.5 μm l-[3H]glutamate (2.5 μCi/ml) (GE Healthcare) and 30 μm unlabeled glutamate for 5 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 400 μl/well. The glutamate uptake was terminated using triple washing with 500 μl of ice-cold choline-containing buffer. After cells were solubilized in 400 μl/well of 0.1 n NaOH, the radioactivity of 360 μl/well lysates was analyzed using an LS6500 scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). Moreover, a 20-μl of aliquot was used to determine its protein concentration using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Five independent glutamate uptake experiments were performed in quintuplicate. For the saturation analysis, l-glutamate concentrations ranged from 10 to 500 μm. Kinetic parameters were determined using the Eadie-Hofstee equation. In the knockdown experiments, cells were grown in 12-well plates and transiently transfected with each double-stranded siRNA (60 pmol/well) for 24 h by using Lipofectamine 2000. After transfection, the cells were treated with 1.3 mm DMSO or 100 nm PMA for 30 min at 37 °C and then subjected to glutamate transport assay. The sense sequence for the siRNA control was 5′-AGCAGGUGUUUCUUGCAAAdTdT-3′. The sense sequence for siRNA 1 was 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-3′. The sense sequence for siRNA 2 was 5′-UUUGCAAGAAACACCUGCUdGdG-3′. The siRNA 1 and siRNA 2 knocked down about 50 and 15%, respectively, of the total addicsin mRNA.Biotinylation Assay—Biotinylation assay was performed as described previously (17Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, C6BU-1-pSw-Arl6ip1, C6BU-1-pSw-addicsin, and C6BU-1-pSw-addicsin Y110A/L112A cells were cultured in 10% FBS-DMEM containing 100 μg/ml Hyglomycin and 250 μg/ml Zeocin on 35-mm culture dishes (BD Biosciences). Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS-Ca2+-Mg2+; 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 9.6 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3). The cells were then reacted with 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-biotin in PBS-Ca2+-Mg2+ at 4 °C for 20 min. Cells were incubated with 100 mm glycine in PBS-Ca2+-Mg2+ at 4 °C for 20 min to remove nonreacted biotin and dissolved in 250 μl RIPA buffer containing 0.1% protease inhibitor. Cell extracts were centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble materials and a 125-μl aliquot of total lysate fraction was obtained. The total lysate fraction was further incubated with equal volume of 50% slurry of avidin beads for 1 h and centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to recover the intracellular lysate fraction. The avidin beads were washed six times with 250 μl of RIPA buffer and were subjected to 65 μl of SDS sample buffer to elute the absorbed proteins while shaking for 30 min. All preserved samples were analyzed by Western blotting.Immunohistochemical Analysis—For distribution analysis of Arl6ip1 and addicsin in vivo, fresh frozen coronal sections 16 μm thick were prepared from mouse adult brain (6-week-old male ddY mouse, Bregma +4.2, –1.8 or –5.3 mm). The sections were stained using the Vectastain™ Elite ABC kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, the sections were fixed with acetone/methanol solution (w/w, 1:1) for 15 min and blocked with 1.5% normal goat serum for 20 min. They were then exposed to the rabbit anti-mouse Arl6ip1 IgG polyclonal antibody or rabbit anti-addicsin IgG overnight at 4 °C. The sections were then incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody for 30 min and streptavidin-conjugated HRP complex for 30 min. Signals were detected using the 3,3′-diaminobenzidine solution. Images were acquired using a BX21 light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For immunostaining of C6BU-1-pSw-Arl6ip1 and C6BU-1-pSw-addicsin cells, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1% normal goat serum for 5 min. After blocking with 1% normal goat serum for 1 h, the cells were reacted with anti-V5 monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C and then exposed to Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary for 1 h. After the cells had been coverslipped in Gel/Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA), images were acquired using a Fluoview FV1000 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).RESULTSIdentification of Arl6ip1 as an Addicsin-associated Factor—To identify potential factors associating with mouse addicsin, a yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out using a full length of addicsin cDNA as bait. From a prey cDNA library prepared from the amygdala of repeatedly morphine-administered mice, 49 positive clones were obtained. Of these positive clones, two clones clearly displayed α-galactosidase activity. These two clones yielded an identical cDNA sequence encoding mouse Arl6ip1 corresponding to its 1–59 amino acids (GenBank™ accession number AF223953) (data not shown). The amino acid sequence analysis revealed that addicsin had no homology with Arl6ip1. However, the hydrophobic profile of addicsin was almost the same as that of Arl6ip1 (data not shown). Reconfirmation testing using a full length of mouse Arl6ip1 as prey or bait revealed specific interactions with addicsin (data not shown). Furthermore, to test this interaction with addicsin and Arl6ip1 in vitro, we prepared crude cell lysates from NG108-15 cells in which the FLAG-tagged Arl6ip1 (Arl6ip1-FLAG) and Myc-tagged addicsin (addicsin-myc) were expressed. Immunoprecipitation assay using these cell lysates demonstrated that Arl6ip1-FLAG specifically interacted with addicsin-myc in the cell extracts prepared from co-expression cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 8), but not from Arl6ip1-FLAG (lanes 2 and 6) or addicsin-myc single-expression cells (lanes 3 and 7). No proteins were immunoprecipitated with either anti-FLAG or anti-c-Myc antibodies in sham NG108-15 cell extracts (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 5), suggesting that there is no specific binding to immunobeads and no cross-reaction of antibodies. Glycerol gradient centrifugation analysis revealed that the elution profile of Arl6ip1-FLAG was very similar to that of addicsin-myc (Fig. 1B). The elution peaks of both proteins were observed at fraction 18 with a deduced molecular mass of 24 kDa (Fig. 1B). In addition, the elution peak of addicsin h"
https://openalex.org/W1970936047,"Polyadenylation of RNA has a decisive influence on RNA stability. Depending on the organisms or subcellular compartment, it either enhances transcript stability or targets RNAs for degradation. In plant mitochondria, polyadenylation promotes RNA degradation, and polyadenylated mitochondrial transcripts are therefore widely considered to be rare and unstable. We followed up a surprising observation that a large number of mitochondrial transcripts are detectable in microarray experiments that used poly(A)-specific RNA probes, and that these transcript levels are significantly enhanced after heat treatment.As the Columbia genome contains a complete set of mitochondrial genes, we had to identify polymorphisms to differentiate between nuclear and mitochondrial copies of a mitochondrial transcript. We found that the affected transcripts were uncapped transcripts of mitochondrial origin, which were polyadenylated at multiple sites within their 3'region. Heat-induced enhancement of these transcripts was quickly restored during a short recovery period.Our results show that polyadenylated transcripts of mitochondrial origin are more stable than previously suggested, and that their steady-state levels can even be significantly enhanced under certain conditions. As many microarrays contain mitochondrial probes, due to the frequent transfer of mitochondrial genes into the genome, these effects need to be considered when interpreting microarray data."
https://openalex.org/W2016006943,"Squamates are a diverse order of vertebrates, representing more than 7,000 species. Yet, descriptions of full-length major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes in this group are nearly absent from the literature, while the number of MHC studies continues to rise in other vertebrate taxa. The lack of basic information about MHC organization in squamates inhibits investigation into the relationship between MHC polymorphism and disease, and leaves a large taxonomic gap in our understanding of amniote MHC evolution. Here, we use both cDNA and genomic sequence data to characterize a class I MHC gene (Amcr-UA) from the Galápagos marine iguana, a member of the squamate subfamily Iguaninae. Amcr-UA appears to be functional since it is expressed in the blood and contains many of the conserved peptide-binding residues that are found in classical class I genes of other vertebrates. In addition, comparison of Amcr-UA to homologous sequences from other iguanine species shows that the antigen-binding portion of this gene is under purifying selection, rather than balancing selection, and therefore may have a conserved function. A striking feature of Amcr-UA is that both the cDNA and genomic sequences lack the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains that are necessary to anchor the class I receptor molecule into the cell membrane, suggesting that the product of this gene is secreted and consequently not involved in classical class I antigen-presentation. The truncated and conserved character of Amcr-UA lead us to define it as a nonclassical gene that is related to the few available squamate class I sequences. However, phylogenetic analysis placed Amcr-UA in a basal position relative to other published classical MHC genes from squamates, suggesting that this gene diverged near the beginning of squamate diversification."
https://openalex.org/W2106905375,"During myocardial infarction reduced blood flow in the heart muscle results in cell death. These dying/dead cells have been reported to bind several plasma proteins such as IgM and C-reactive protein (CRP). In the present study we investigated whether fluid-phase complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein (C4BP) would also bind to the infarcted heart tissue.Initial studies using immunohistochemistry on tissue arrays for several cardiovascular disorders indicated that C4BP can be found in heart tissue in several cardiac diseases but that it is most abundantly found in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This condition was studied in more detail by analyzing the time window and extent of C4BP positivity. The binding of C4BP correlates to the same locations as C3b, a marker known to correlate to the patterns of IgM and CRP staining. Based on criteria that describe the time after infarction we were able to pinpoint that C4BP binding is a relatively early marker of tissue damage in myocardial infarction with a peak of binding between 12 hours and 5 days subsequent to AMI, the phase in which infiltration of neutrophilic granulocytes in the heart is the most extensive.C4BP, an important fluid-phase inhibitor of the classical and lectin pathway of complement activation binds to jeopardized cardiomyocytes early after AMI and co-localizes to other well known markers such as C3b."
https://openalex.org/W2048276949,"The Ras GTPase-activating protein RasGAP catalyzes the conversion of active GTP-bound Ras into inactive GDP-bound Ras. However, RasGAP also acts as a positive effector of Ras and exerts an anti-apoptotic activity that is independent of its GAP function and that involves its SH3 (Src homology) domain. We used a combinatorial peptide aptamer approach to select a collection of RasGAP SH3 specific ligands. We mapped the peptide aptamer binding sites by performing yeast two-hybrid mating assays against a panel of RasGAP SH3 mutants. We examined the biological activity of a peptide aptamer targeting a pocket delineated by residues D295/7, L313 and W317. This aptamer shows a caspase-independent cytotoxic activity on tumor cell lines. It disrupts the interaction between RasGAP and Aurora B kinase. This work identifies the above-mentioned pocket as an interesting therapeutic target to pursue and points its cognate peptide aptamer as a promising guide to discover RasGAP small-molecule drug candidates."
https://openalex.org/W2123724449,"We introduce a novel technique to determine the expression state of a gene from quantitative information measuring its expression. Adopting a productive abstraction from current thinking in molecular biology, we consider two expression states for a gene--Up or Down. We determine this state by using a statistical model that assumes the data behaves as a combination of two biological distributions. Given a cohort of hybridizations, our algorithm predicts, for the single reading, the probability of each gene's being in an Up or a Down state in each hybridization. Using a series of publicly available gene expression data sets, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the prevalent algorithm. We also show that our algorithm can be used in conjunction with expression adjustment techniques to produce a more biologically sound gene-state call. The technique we present here enables a routine update, where the continuously evolving expression level adjustments feed into gene-state calculations. The technique can be applied in almost any multi-sample gene expression experiment, and holds equal promise for protein abundance experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1971795312,"The Species Abundance Distribution (SAD) is a fundamental property of ecological communities and the form and formation of SADs have been examined for a wide range of communities including those of microorganisms. Progress in understanding microbial SADs, however, has been limited by the remarkable diversity and vast size of microbial communities. As a result, few microbial systems have been sampled with sufficient depth to generate reliable estimates of the community SAD. We have used a novel approach to characterize the SAD of bacterial communities by coupling genomic DNA fractionation with analysis of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (GC-TRFLP). Examination of a soil microbial community through GC-TRFLP revealed 731 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that followed a lognormal distribution. To recover the same 731 OTUs through analysis of DNA sequence data is estimated to require analysis of 86,264 16S rRNA sequences. The approach is examined and validated through construction and analysis of simulated microbial communities in silico. Additional simulations performed to assess the potential effects of PCR bias show that biased amplification can cause a community whose distribution follows a power-law function to appear lognormally distributed. We also show that TRFLP analysis, in contrast to GC-TRFLP, is not able to effectively distinguish between competing SAD models. Our analysis supports use of the lognormal as the null distribution for studying the SAD of bacterial communities as for plant and animal communities."
https://openalex.org/W2019586694,"Protein phosphorylation mediates many critical cellular responses and is essential for many biological functions during development. About one-third of cellular proteins are phosphorylated, representing the phosphor-proteome, and phosphorylation can alter a protein's function, activity, localization and stability. Tyrosine phosphorylation events mediated by aberrant activation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) pathways have been proven to be involved in the development of several diseases including cancer. To understand the systems biology of RTK activation, we have developed a phosphor-proteome focused on tyrosine phosphorylation events under insulin and EGF signaling pathways using the PhosphoScan technique coupled with high-throughput mass spectrometry analysis. Comparative proteomic analyses of all these tyrosine phosphorylation events revealed that around 70% of these pY events are conserved in human orthologs and paralogs. A careful analysis of published in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation events from literature and patents revealed that around 38% of pY events from Drosophila proteins conserved on 185 human proteins are confirmed in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation events. Hence the data are validated partially based on available reports, and the credibility of the remaining 62% of novel conserved sites that are unpublished so far is very high but requires further follow-up studies. The novel pY events found in this study that are conserved on human proteins could potentially lead to the discovery of drug targets and biomarkers for the detection of various cancers and neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2128249110,"Background Understanding the time course of how listeners reconstruct a missing fundamental component in an auditory stimulus remains elusive. We report MEG evidence that the missing fundamental component of a complex auditory stimulus is recovered in auditory cortex within 100 ms post stimulus onset. Methodology Two outside tones of four-tone complex stimuli were held constant (1200 Hz and 2400 Hz), while two inside tones were systematically modulated (between 1300 Hz and 2300 Hz), such that the restored fundamental (also knows as “virtual pitch”) changed from 100 Hz to 600 Hz. Constructing the auditory stimuli in this manner controls for a number of spectral properties known to modulate the neuromagnetic signal. The tone complex stimuli only diverged on the value of the missing fundamental component. Principal Findings We compared the M100 latencies of these tone complexes to the M100 latencies elicited by their respective pure tone (spectral pitch) counterparts. The M100 latencies for the tone complexes matched their pure sinusoid counterparts, while also replicating the M100 temporal latency response curve found in previous studies. Conclusions Our findings suggest that listeners are reconstructing the inferred pitch by roughly 100 ms after stimulus onset and are consistent with previous electrophysiological research suggesting that the inferential pitch is perceived in early auditory cortex."
