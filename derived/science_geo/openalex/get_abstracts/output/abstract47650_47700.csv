https://openalex.org/W1559597940,"Purification of the oily, nonpolar fraction of high protein barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) flour by high pressure liquid chromatography yielded 10 major components, two (I, II) of which were potent inhibitors of cholesterogenesis in vivo and in vitro. The addition of purified inhibitor I (2.5-20 ppm) to chick diets significantly decreased hepatic cholesterogenesis and serum total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and concomitantly increased lipogenic activity. The high resolution mass spectrometric analysis and measurement of different peaks of inhibitor I gave a molecular ion at m/e 424 (C29H44O2) and main peaks at m/e 205, 203, and 165 corresponding to C13H17O2, C13H15O2, and C10H13O2 moieties, respectively. which are characteristic of d-alpha-tocotrienol. This identification was confirmed against synthetic samples. The tocotrienols are widely distributed in the plant kingdom and differ from tocopherols (vitamin E) only in three double bonds in the isoprenoid chain which appear to be essential for the inhibition of cholesterogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1505823785,"Analysis of Clostridium pasteurianum genomic DNA indicates that the ferredoxin (Fd) gene is present in a single copy. The cloned Fd gene previously described (Graves, M.C., Mullenbach, G. T., and Rabinowitz, J. C. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 1653-1657) was used to map in vivo and in vitro synthesized Fd transcripts. The in vivo mRNA was sized in two ways: by Northern hybridization analysis, and more directly from the known DNA sequence after the 5'- and 3'-termini were identified. The 5'-end was determined by primer extension-dideoxy sequencing and the 3'-end by S1 nuclease mapping. The monocistronic Fd mRNA contains about 255 nucleotides and, thus, is one of the shortest bacterial mRNAs yet described. We also examined the Fd transcripts produced by Escherichia coli transformed with the plasmid containing the Fd gene. E. coli RNA polymerase most likely recognizes the same promoter (P1) as the clostridial polymerase, and furthermore, efficiently uses an additional promoter (P2) that is poorly recognized by the normal host enzyme. For comparison, in vitro transcripts were generated by E. coli and Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerases. In vitro, only promoter P1 is used by either E. coli or B. subtilis RNA polymerase. The 3'-end of each of the four types of transcripts occurs essentially at the same location and maps to within a large dyad symmetry element. Comparison of the Fd promoter with other Gram-positive promoters reveals that some sequences outside of the traditional Pribnow and -35 regions are conserved. This analysis indicates that an extended promoter recognition site may be required in these organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1481645778,"A new photoreactive amino acid analog, p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine, is described. Convenient methods for the preparation of this amino acid and its subsequent incorporation into synthetic peptides by the solid-phase technique are outlined. To illustrate its utility, p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine was substituted in place of tryptophan in a 17-residue calmodulin-binding peptide. The substitution did not measurably affect the affinity of this peptide for calmodulin. When this peptide was photolyzed at 350 nm in a 1:1 molar ratio with calmodulin in the presence of 500 microM CaCl2, 70% of the calmodulin was derivatized. The specificity of the reaction was investigated by photolysis in the absence of CaCl2 where little binding occurs; under these conditions little or no photolabeling occurred."
https://openalex.org/W1549632498,"Recent evidence suggests that the hepatic iron-loading characteristic of hemochromatosis may result in part from efficient hepatic clearance of non-transferrin-bound iron, which is increased in this disorder. However, this hypothesis assumes that hepatic clearance remains highly efficient despite excess iron stores. We therefore studied hepatic uptake of non-transferrin-bound iron in the single-pass perfused rat liver under varying conditions. Animals were iron loaded or depleted by dietary manipulation, but no changes in the efficiency of ferrous iron uptake or the kinetic parameters were seen (single-pass extraction, 59-74%; Km, 16-19 microM; Vmax, 30-32 nmol X min-1 X g liver-1). Added divalent zinc, cobalt, and manganese ions reversibly inhibited ferrous iron uptake and the inhibition by zinc was shown to be competitive. Uptake required calcium, was markedly temperature-sensitive (delta E = 14.3 Kcal/mol), and was relatively insensitive to inhibition of cellular energy metabolism. Particles consistent with ferritin cores were seen in lysosomes of hepatic parenchymal cells within 30 min of perfusion with ferrous iron. These results suggest that ferrous iron is cleared from plasma by a passive, saturable transport process that is not regulated by the iron content of the liver and that may be shared with other transition metal ions. Because clearance is highly efficient, increased levels of non-transferrin-bound iron in plasma may present the liver with an obligatory iron load resulting in progressive accumulation and toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1559708854,"We describe herein the purification of a protein from skeletal muscle that binds to (caps) the morphologically defined barbed end of actin filaments. This actin-capping protein appeared to be a heterodimer with chemically and immunologically distinct subunits of Mr = 36,000 (alpha) and 32,000 (beta), Rs = 37 A, s20,w = 4.0 S, and a calculated native molecular weight of approximately 61,000. The protein was obtained in milligram quantities at greater than 95% purity from acetone powder of chicken skeletal muscle by extraction in 0.6 M KI, precipitation with ammonium sulfate, sequential chromatographic steps on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, and Sephacryl S-200, followed by preparative rate zonal sucrose density gradient centrifugation. In immunoblots of myofibrillar proteins, affinity-purified antibodies selectively recognized protein bands of the same molecular weight as the subunits of the capping protein to which they were made, indicating that the isolated capping protein is a native myofibrillar protein, and not a proteolytic digestion product of a larger muscle protein. A specific interaction of the capping protein with the barbed end of actin filaments was indicated by its ability to inhibit actin filament assembly nucleated by spectrin-band 4.1-actin complex in 0.4 mM Mg2+, accelerate actin filament formation and increase the critical concentration of actin in 2-5 mM Mg2+, 75-100 mM KCl, and inhibit the addition of actin monomers to the barbed end of heavy meromyosin-decorated actin filaments as determined by electron microscopy. All of these effects occurred at nanomolar concentrations of capping protein and micromolar concentrations of actin, suggesting a high affinity interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1499968189,"Neonatal gonadectomy studies and hormonal replacement regimens were employed to characterize the regulation of delta 4-steroid 5 alpha-reductase, microsomal flavin-containing monooxygenase, and several forms of rat hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450, including three that are sexually differentiated. Rats of both sexes that had been gonadectomized at birth were either untreated or were administered testosterone propionate or estradiol benzoate neonatally (subcutaneous injection on days 1 and 3 of life), postpubertally (an implant of a hormone-packed capsule at 5 weeks of age), or both neonatally and postpubertally. At the age of 10 weeks, all rats were killed, and several liver microsomal enzymes were assayed using immunochemical and catalytic techniques. Expression in the 10-week-old male and female rats of two male-specific cytochrome P-450 forms, termed P-4502c/UT-A and P-4502a/PCN-E, and their associated respective 16 alpha- and 6 beta-steroid hydroxylase activities could either be imprinted (programmed) by androgen exposure during the early neonatal period or, alternatively, could be stimulated by continuous hormone treatment after the age of 5 weeks. By contrast, hepatic expression of two female-specific enzymes, P-4502d/UT-1 and delta 4-steroid 5 alpha-reductase, was only partially dependent on estradiol; birth-gonadectomized rats expressed as much as 30-50% of the enzyme levels present in untreated adult females. Expression of both female-specific enzymes was fully suppressed upon postpubertal exposure to testosterone. In another study, birth sham-operated female rats were administered testosterone using the same regimens described above for the birth-gonadectomized rats. Although neonatal testosterone treatment alone did not affect the expression in these females of the four sex-specific enzymes examined in this study, it did enhance significantly the masculinization effected by postpubertal androgen exposure. This resulted in expression of the male-specific enzymes P-4502c/UT-A and P-4502a/PCN-E in these females at levels comparable to those found in adult males, while simultaneously suppressing the two female-specific enzymes, P-4502d/UT-I and delta 4-steroid 5 alpha-reductase, by approximately 70-75% to levels characteristic of prepubertal rats of either sex. The levels of another microsomal enzyme, flavin-containing monooxygenase, were also measured and found to be regulated by testosterone, but the ontogenic profiles and the effects of gonadectomy and hormone replacement indicated clear differences in its regulation when compared to the other male-specific enzymes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1527565099,"Two families of platelet phospholipase A2 activity, were chromatographically resolved by anion exchange chromatography and were functionally distinguishable by their differential phospholipid subclass substrate specificity and calcium ion requirements. The major phospholipase A2 activity was present in the cytosolic compartment, eluted from DEAE-cellulose at 230 mM NaCl (hereafter referred to as phospholipase A2(beta)), and demonstrated a 100-fold selectivity in catalyzing the hydrolysis of 1-(O)-(Z)-hexadecenyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (plasmenylcholine) in comparisons with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (phosphatidylcholine). Phospholipase A2(beta) was purified to homogeneity by sequential gel filtration and Mono Q column chromatographies. Phospholipase A2(beta) eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 58 kDa during gel filtration chromatography and migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating that its native quaternary structure is dimeric. Fast protein liquid chromatography demonstrated that the polypeptides catalyzing this activity were comprised of multiple isoforms which possessed different specific activities. Each isoform required Ca2+ ion for activity and was completely activated over the range through which Ca2+ ion concentration is augmented in stimulated platelets (i.e. 300-800 nM)."
https://openalex.org/W1541186016,"We have investigated the pH-dependent fusion activity of influenza virus toward human erythrocyte ghosts, utilizing a recently developed fluorescence assay, which permits continuous monitoring of the fusion reaction. The rate of fusion is negligible at neutral pH but shows a sharp increase at pH values just below 5.5. This pH dependence profile closely corresponds to that of virus-induced hemolysis. Fusion is rapidly inactivated by a low-pH preincubation of the virus alone either at 37 or at 0 degrees C. The presence of ghosts during this low-pH preincubation, carried out at 0 degree C under which condition there is hardly any fusion, causes a significant protection of the viral fusion activity against inactivation. Fusion initiated at low pH can be arrested instantaneously by readjustment of the pH to neutral. The characteristics of fusion of influenza virus with ghosts deviate from those of fusion with cardiolipin liposomes (Stegmann, T., Hoekstra, D., Scherphof, G., and Wilschut, J. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 3107-3113). Fusion with ghosts is consistent with a requirement of the well-documented pH-dependent conformational change in the viral hemagglutinin, whereas fusion with cardiolipin liposomes does not exhibit a strict dependence on the conformational change. Rather, the negative surface charge on the liposomes plays a critical role, as zwitterionic liposomes containing gangliosides show fusion behavior similar to that of erythrocyte ghosts."
https://openalex.org/W1589624003,"A rat brain S100-binding protein, R40,000, has been isolated, characterized, and identified as fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. R40,000 was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydroxylapatite chromatography, dye-binding chromatography, and electroelution from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Microsequence analysis of a fragment of R40,000 revealed a 15-residue amino acid sequence which shows a high degree of homology to the amino acid sequence of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase from rabbit muscle and rat liver. Further characterization demonstrated that R40,000 has an amino acid composition, subunit molecular weight, and cyanogen bromide map similar to aldolase. In addition, purified aldolase interacts with S100 alpha and S100 beta by gel overlay, and aldolase enzyme activity is stimulated 2-fold in vitro by S100 alpha and S100 beta. S100 interacts predominantly with the C or brain-specific form of the enzyme in gels and stimulates the activity of the C-enriched form of the enzyme in a calcium-dependent manner. Altogether, these data suggest that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase may be an intracellular target of S100 action in brain."
https://openalex.org/W1485677996,"Protein A1 (Mr approximately 32,000), a major glycine-rich protein of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP), was purified to near homogeneity under nondenaturing conditions from HeLa cells. Limited proteolysis of the native protein yields a trypsin-resistant N-terminal nucleic acid-binding domain about 195 amino acids long which has a primary structure nearly identical to that of the 195-amino acid-long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein UP1 (Mr 22,162) from calf thymus (Williams, K.R., Stone, K. L., LoPresti, M.B., Merrill, B. M., and Planck, S.R. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 5666-5670). 45 of the 61 glycine residues of A1 are present in the trypsin-sensitive C-terminal domain of the protein which contains no sequences homologous to UP1. Protein A2, another major glycine-rich core hnRNP protein from HeLa, has a domain structure analogous to A1 and appears to be related to ssDNA-binding proteins UP1-B from calf liver and HDP-1 from mouse myeloma in a way similar to the A1/UP1 relationship. In contrast to ssDNA-binding proteins, A1 binds preferentially to RNA over ssDNA and exhibits no helix-destabilizing activity."
https://openalex.org/W1511384490,"The receptor on mouse peritoneal macrophages that mediates the uptake of canine beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) has been identified in this study as an unusual apolipoprotein (apo-) B,E(LDL) receptor. Ligand blots of Triton X-100 extracts of mouse peritoneal macrophages using 125I-beta-VLDL identified a single protein. This protein cross-reacted with antibodies against bovine apo-B,E(LDL) receptors, but its apparent Mr was approximately 5,000 less than that of the human apo-B,E(LDL) receptor. Binding studies at 4 degrees C demonstrated specific and saturable binding of low density lipoproteins (LDL), beta-VLDL, and cholesterol-induced high density lipoproteins in plasma that contain apo-E as their only protein constituent (apo-E HDLc) to mouse macrophages. Apolipoprotein E-containing lipoproteins (beta-VLDL and apo-E HDLc) bound to mouse macrophages and human fibroblasts with the same high affinity. However, LDL bound to mouse macrophages with an 18-fold lower affinity than to human fibroblasts. Mouse fibroblasts also bound LDL with a similar low affinity. Compared with the apo-B,E(LDL) receptors on human fibroblasts, the apo-B,E(LDL) receptors on mouse macrophages were resistant to down-regulation by incubation of the cells with LDL or beta-VLDL. There are three lines of evidence that an unusual apo-B,E(LDL) receptor on mouse peritoneal macrophages mediates the binding and uptake of beta-VLDL: LDL with residual apo-E removed displaced completely the 125I-beta-VLDL binding to mouse macrophages, preincubation of the mouse macrophages with apo-B,E(LDL) receptor antibody inhibited both the binding of beta-VLDL and LDL to the cells and the formation of beta-VLDL- and LDL-induced cholesteryl esters, and binding of 125I-beta-VLDL to the cells after down-regulation correlated directly with the amount of mouse macrophage apo-B,E(LDL) receptor as determined on immunoblots. This unusual receptor binds LDL poorly, but binds apo-E-containing lipoproteins with normal very high affinity and is resistant to down-regulation by extracellular cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1529173444,"Ornithine decarboxylase activity was assessed in serum-deprived quiescent NIH-3T3 murine fibroblasts after exposure to a variety of growth-promoting factors. Ornithine decarboxylase activity increased after treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), fetal calf serum, bovine pituitary fibroblast growth factor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and the synthetic diacyglycerol sn-1,2-dioctanolyglycerol but not after treatment with epidermal growth factor, insulin, 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, sn-1,2-dibutyrylglycerol, or the calcium ionophore A23187. Activity peaked at 3-4 h and returned to basal levels after 8 h. To determine the importance of protein kinase C in this increase, cells were pretreated with PMA for 16 h to make the cells effectively deficient in protein kinase C; this deficiency was documented by direct measurement of enzyme activity and immunoreactivity. The ornithine decarboxylase response to each mitogen was then compared in cells pretreated with PMA or control conditions. PMA pretreatment abolished the increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity due to additional PMA and decreased but did not eliminate the ability of serum, FGF, and PDGF to cause increases in ornithine decarboxylase activity. Similarly, pretreatment with PMA abolished the ability of additional PMA to increase ornithine decarboxylase mRNA levels but did not prevent the increases in these mRNA levels caused by FGF or serum. These data suggest that the increases in ornithine decarboxylase activity and mRNA levels that occur in quiescent fibroblasts in response to serum, FGF, or PDGF are due to activation of at least two separate pathways, one involving protein kinase C and the other independent of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1567446113,"We present, here, evidence for a pretranslational role of procollagen propeptides in the regulation of collagen synthesis. Amino- and carboxyl-terminal type I procollagen propeptides were isolated and purified from chick calvaria and tendon cultures. Human lung fibroblasts (IMR-90) were incubated in medium containing varying concentrations of propeptides. Amino-propeptides at 10 nM caused an 80% decrease in collagen synthesis compared to control. Higher concentrations of amino-propeptides did not decrease collagen synthesis further and no significant effect on non-collagen synthesis was found throughout the entire concentration range. Carboxyl-propeptides also inhibited collagen synthesis. At 10 nM, collagen synthesis was decreased by 30% and a concentration of 40 nM caused an 80% reduction. However, at the latter concentration non-collagen synthesis was also affected, decreasing by 20% relative to control. To assess possible pretranslational effects of propeptides, IMR-90 fibroblasts were treated with varying concentrations of each propeptide and levels of type I procollagen mRNA was determined by dot hybridization with a 32P-alpha 2(I) cDNA probe. Both propeptides caused significant concentration-dependent decreases in procollagen type I mRNA levels. At 10 nM, the amino-propeptide resulted in a 55% decrease in collagen mRNA levels while at 40 nM these levels decreased by 72% compared to control. Carboxyl-propeptides were also inhibitory, decreasing mRNA levels by 33% at 10 nM and 73% at 40 nM. Messenger RNA levels of a representative noncollagenous protein, beta-actin, were unaffected by either propeptide throughout the concentration range."
https://openalex.org/W1553905802,"Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase was purified from porcine brain cytosol through sequential steps involving acid precipitation, DEAE-chromatography, and calmodulin-Sepharose chromatography. The purified enzyme contained a major Mr 50,000 and a minor Mr 60,000 peptide. Porcine brain tubulin was a major substrate for this kinase. Under optimal conditions 2.6 mol of phosphate were incorporated per mol of tubulin. The kinase phosphorylated both tubulin subunits at their carboxyl-terminal region. Limited proteolysis, using trypsin and chymotrypsin, of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated tubulins resulted in different cleavage patterns as determined by peptide mapping. Phosphorylated tubulin was unable to bind to microtubule-associated protein or to polymerize, but regained its assembly capacity after phosphatase treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1590290940,"Purified human red blood cell sugar transport protein intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence is quenched by D-glucose and 4,6-ethylidene glucose (sugars that bind to the transport), phloretin and cytochalasin B (transport inhibitors), and ATP. Cytochalasin B-induced quenching is a simple saturable phenomenon with Kd app of 0.15 microM and maximum capacity of 0.85 cytochalasin B binding sites per transporter. Sugar-induced quenching consists of two saturable components characterized by low and high Kd app binding parameters. These binding sites appear to correspond to influx and efflux transport sites, respectively, and coexist within the transporter molecule. ATP-induced quenching is also a simple saturable process with Kd app of 50 microM. Indirect estimates suggest that the ratio of ATP-binding sites per transporter is 0.87:1. ATP reduces the low Kd app and increases the high Kd app for sugar-induced fluorescence quenching. This effect is half-maximal at 45 microM ATP. ATP produces a 4-fold reduction in Km and 2.4-fold reduction in Vmax for cytochalasin B-inhibitable D-glucose efflux from inside-out red cell membrane vesicles (IOVs). This effect on transport is half-maximal at 45 microM ATP. AMP, ADP, alpha, beta-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate, and beta, gamma-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate at 1 mM are without effect on efflux of D-glucose from IOVs. ATP modulation of Km for D-glucose efflux from IOVs is immediate in onset and recovery. ATP inhibition of Vmax for D-glucose exit is complete within 5-15 min and is only partly reversed following 30-min incubation in ATP-free medium. These findings suggest that the human red cell sugar transport protein contains a nucleotide-binding site(s) through which ATP modifies the catalytic properties of the transporter."

M., and Hakomori, S. (1983). J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11793-11797) have been detected in human colonic carcinoma cases. Three Ley-active components have been identified as follows. The simplest compound was characterized as Ley hexaosylceramide (lactodifucohexaosylceramide, III3FucIV2FucnLc4), which was previously isolated and was found as the major component in six out of eight cases of colonic adenocarcinoma but as only a very minor component in two cases. The second component was a very minor component in all eight cases, and its structure was identified by 1H NMR spectroscopy as an extended Ley (lactodifucooctaosylceramide, V3FucVI2FucnLc6; Structure 1 below). The third, major component, common in all eight cases, has been identified as trifucosyl Ley (lactotrifucononaosylceramide, III3FucV3FucVI2FucnLc6, Structure 2 below) based on 1H NMR spectroscopy, methylation analysis, and direct-probe electron-impact mass spectrometry.

https://openalex.org/W1497884280,"Leukotriene D4 stimulates prostanoid synthesis in smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Because phospholipases A2 and C have been proposed to regulate prostanoid synthesis, we examined the effect of leukotriene D4 on these activities. Leukotriene D4 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent, stereospecific increase in phospholipase A2 activity with phosphatidylcholine as a substrate. The induction of phospholipase A2 activity occurred just prior to the appearance of prostanoids in the media. Protein and RNA synthesis were required for the increase in phospholipase A2 activity, and the increase in activity resulted from an increase in the apparent Vmax of the phospholipase A2 enzyme. Phospholipase C activity using various substrates was unchanged. We conclude that the increase in prostanoid synthesis observed after leukotriene D4 treatment is a result of an increase in a phospholipase A2 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1563473352,"An exonuclease III assay (Wu, C. (1985) Nature 317, 84-87) was used to identify in nuclear extracts of NIH 3T3 cells a factor which binds to the CCAAT segment of the alpha 2(I) collagen promoter between -80 and -84. This sequence is located on the coding strand in the alpha 2(I) collagen promoter. Binding is specific since only promoter fragments which contain the CCAAT box sequences on one or the other DNA strand inhibit binding to the alpha 2(I) collagen CCAAT box. The CCAAT binding factor protects approximately 26 base pairs of the alpha 2(I) collagen promoter from exonuclease III digestion. Binding to the alpha 2(I) collagen promoter CCAAT box is not inhibited by a fragment of the alpha 1(III) collagen promoter (from -396 to +16), which does not contain a CCAAT sequence on either one or the other strand. Our data suggest that two genes such as the alpha 2(I) and alpha 1(III) collagen genes, which are coordinately expressed in many tissues, are not necessarily regulated by the same trans-acting DNA binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1482297636,"A common protease-resistant fragment (Mr = 27,000) was generated from purified rat hepatic actinogelin, and rat skeletal muscle and chicken gizzard alpha-actinins by limited proteolysis using thermolysin. A monoclonal antibody (A-1) which was raised against the rat hepatic actinogelin and has a cross-reactivity with rat skeletal muscle and chicken gizzard alpha-actinins was found to bind to all of the 27-kDa fragments selectively. Furthermore, one-dimensional peptide maps of the 27-kDa fragments showed a close similarity indicating the presence of some conservation in primary structure of the fragments. The 27-kDa fragments were purified to homogeneity by the same procedure using ammonium sulfate fractionation and hydrophobic chromatography. As the fragments were easily separated from other peptides during purification, they might be present as an independent structural domain. Purified 27-kDa fragments were found to bind to F-actin in a Ca2+-insensitive manner. The fragments failed to affect the low-shear viscosity of F-actin up to a molar ratio to actin monomer of 1:3.2, indicating that gelation activity of the parental molecules was lost and the fragments have only a single binding site on F-actin. Binding of the fragments to F-actin was almost completely inhibited by respective parental molecules, while binding of the whole molecules was blocked partly by their 27-kDa fragments. Thus, the interaction of the fragments with F-actin seemed to be specific, although apparent affinity was lower than the parental molecules. Considering these results, we concluded that the 27-kDa fragments are a conserved, monovalent, and Ca2+-insensitive actin-binding domain of the actinogelin and muscle alpha-actinins."

Electrophoretic migration of the homogeneous enzyme on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels reveals a subunit Mr of 42,000. By contrast to the well-characterized, cytosolic dihydroorotate oxidases (EC 1.3.3.1), the purified bovine dehydrogenase is a dihydroorotate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. Maximal rates of orotate formation are obtained using coenzymes Q6 or Q7 as cosubstrate electron acceptors. Concomitant with substrate oxidation, the enzyme will reduce simple quinones, such as benzoquinone, but at significantly lower rates (10-15%) than that obtained for reduction of coenzyme Q6. Enzyme-catalyzed substrate oxidation is not supported by molecular oxygen. The specificity of the purified enzyme for dihydropyrimidine substrates has also been explored. The methyl-, ethyl-, t-butyl-, and benzyl-S-dihydroorotates are substrates, but 1- and 3-methyl and 1,3-dimethyl methyl-S-dihydroorotates are not. Competitive inhibitors include product orotate, 5-methyl orotate, and racemic cis-5-methyl dihydroorotate."
https://openalex.org/W1514392736,"A protein kinase was isolated from spinach thylakoid membranes by solubilization with octyl glucoside and cholate. The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and sucrose density centrifugation, followed by affinity chromatography on either Affi-Gel blue (yielding denatured enzyme) or on histone cross-linked to Sepharose (yielding active enzyme). Electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, followed by staining with silver, revealed the kinase as a single band corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 64 kDa. The active enzyme underwent autophosphorylation and could be detected by autoradiography following incubation with [gamma-32P]ATP and Mg2+ ion. The specific phosphotransferase activity of purified kinase was approximately 30 nmol of phosphate min-1 (mg protein)-1 with lysine-rich histone (III-S or V-S) as substrate; casein was phosphorylated at approximately 30% of this rate. The physiological substrate for the kinase is presumed to be light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein complex. In solubilized form, this was phosphorylated at approximately 10% of the rate observed with histone III-S as substrate, or 10-100 times slower than the estimated rate of phosphorylation of the light-harvesting complex in situ. Possible reasons for this shortfall are considered. The kinase is proposed as the principal effector of thylakoid protein phosphorylation and associated State transition phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W1553946011,"Lumbricus terrestris HbO2 and HbCO dissociated below pH 5.0; a time-dependent alteration to the met form occurred at pH less than 5 and pH less than 4.5, respectively. The extent of dissociation was unaffected by alkaline earth cations but was decreased by an increase in ionic strength. HbO2 and HbCO exposed to pH 4.0-4.8 were centrifuged to obtain the undissociated pellet (P1) and dissociated supernatant (S1) fractions. S1 was reassociated at pH 7.0 by dialysis against various buffers and then centrifuged to obtain the reassociated pellet (P2) and unreassociated supernatant (S2) fractions. Reassociation was possible only if S1 was dialyzed against water prior to return to neutral pH; otherwise precipitation occurred starting at about pH 5.3. The extent of reassociation varied from about 40 to 80%, was usually higher for HbCO than HbO2, and was unaffected by an increase in ionic strength or by Ca(II). Gel filtration of P2 on Sephacryl S-300 at neutral pH gave one peak IaR, eluting at a slightly greater volume than the native Hb; S1 and S2 gave in addition, three peaks, Ib (200 kDa), II (65 kDa), and III (18 kDa). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that P2 was slightly deficient in subunit M relative to the Hb, that Ib was deficient in subunits D1 and D2 and that II and III consisted of subunits D1 + D2 + T and subunit M, respectively. Scanning transmission electron microscopy of P2 showed that it was smaller than the native hemoglobin: 25 nm in diameter and 16 nm in height, instead of 30 X 20 nm.

Chem. 259, 628-639) with those obtained in this study suggested that the Hb quaternary structure was not multimeric and that an alternative model had to be considered. In the proposed model it is assumed that subunits D1 and D2 form a scaffolding or bracelet, decorated with 12 complexes of M and T subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1539772193,"During oxidation of nitrite, cells of Nitrobacter winogradskyi are shown to catalyze the active exchange of oxygen atoms between exogenous nitrate molecules (production of 15N16/18O3- during incubation of 14N16/18O3-, 15N16O3-, and 15N16O2- in H216O). Little, if any, exchange of oxygens between nitrate and water also occurs (production of 15N16/18O3- during incubation of 15N16O3- and 14N16O2- in H218O). 15N species of nitrate were assayed by 18O-isotope shift in 15N NMR. Taking into account the O-exchange reactions which occur during nitrite oxidation, H2O is seen to be the source of O in nitrate produced by oxidation of nitrite by N. winogradskyi. The data do not establish whether the nitrate-nitrate O exchange is catalyzed by nitrite oxidase (H2O + HNO2----HNO3 + 2H+ + 2e-) or nitrate reductase (HNO3 + 2H+ + 2e-----HNO2 + H2O) or both enzymes in consort. The nitrate-nitrate exchange reaction suggests the existence of an oxygen derivative of a H2O-utilizing oxidoreductase."
https://openalex.org/W1523092637,"Microvitellogenin belongs to a new class of low molecular weight female-specific proteins in insects. The protein is found in the hemolymph (blood) and egg of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. The isolation of microvitellogenin has been achieved by a combination of gel permeation, cation-exchange, and adsorption chromatographic steps. Microvitellogenin is synthesized by the fat body and appears in the hemolymph 17 days before adult emergence, or 16 days before the onset of egg development. The protein is sequestered from the hemolymph into the egg where it accumulates to a relatively high concentration. The proteins isolated from the hemolymph and the egg are identical in their molecular weight, amino acid compositions, isoelectric points, circular dichroic spectra, immunological properties, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. Thus, microvitellogenin does not seem to undergo any modifications before or after it is sequestered in the egg. In solution, the protein exists in a monomeric form and has a secondary structure composed of approximately 38% alpha-helix, as estimated by CD analysis. The CD spectrum of microvitellogenin is unusual in that it has a strong positive band between 220 and 240 nm that may be due to contributions from the aromatic amino acid residues. Unlike the major egg yolk protein of insects, vitellogenin, microvitellogenin does not contain measurable carbohydrate or lipid, and has no immunological, chemical, or physical similarities to vitellogenin. The amino acid composition of microvitellogenin is low in cysteine, but is rich in aspartate. The sex specificity of the protein and its accumulation in the egg justifies the name microvitellogenin, first given to an analogous protein in the egg of the giant silkmoth, Hyalophora cecropia."
https://openalex.org/W1556571070,"We have examined the effect that microinjection of a monoclonal antibody directed against human DNA polymerase-alpha (SJK-287) has on DNA synthesis in exponentially growing human, mouse, and hamster cell lines. We show that the SJK-287 antibody, when microinjected directly into the nuclei of cells is capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis in all three cell lines tested. Moreover, the effectiveness with which this antibody can inhibit ongoing DNA synthesis by the microinjection assay is closely correlated with the ability of the antibody to neutralize DNA polymerase-alpha activity fractionated from each cell line in vitro. Two other monoclonal antibodies of the same class, one directed against the cellular p53 protein (PAb122), and one directed against the c-myc protein (PM-8) were also tested for their ability to inhibit ongoing DNA synthesis by direct microinjection and in lysolecithin permeabilized cells. Both monoclonal antibodies failed to inhibit ongoing DNA synthesis in exponentially growing cells by these assays."
https://openalex.org/W1543064002,"The orientation of mannosidase II, an integral Golgi membrane protein involved in asparagine-linked oligosaccharide processing, has been examined in rat liver Golgi membranes. Previous studies on mannosidase II purified from Golgi membranes revealed an intact subunit of 124,000 daltons, as well as a catalytically active 110,000-dalton degradation product generated during purification (Moremen, K. W., and Touster, O. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6654-6662). In Triton X-100 extracts of Golgi membranes, the intact enzyme was cleaved by a variety of proteases to generate degradation products similar to those observed previously. At appropriate concentrations, chymotrypsin, pronase, and proteinase K generated 110,000-dalton species, while trypsin and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease generated 115,000-dalton forms. Cleavage by chymotrypsin under mild conditions (10 micrograms/ml, 10 min, 20 degrees C) resulted in a complete conversion to a catalytically active 110,000-dalton form of the enzyme which was extremely resistant to further degradation. Attempts to demonstrate these protease digestions in nonpermeabilized Golgi membranes were unsuccessful, a result suggesting that the protease-sensitive regions are not accessible on the external surface of the membrane. In Golgi membranes permeabilized by treatment with 0.5% saponin, mannosidase II could readily be cleaved to the 110,000-dalton form by digestion with chymotrypsin under conditions similar to those which result in a proteolytic inactivation of galactosyltransferase, a lumenal Golgi membrane marker. Although mannosidase II catalytic activity was not diminished by this chymotrypsin digestion, as much as 90% of the enzyme activity was converted to a nonsedimentable form. To examine the effect of the proteolytic cleavage on the partition behavior of the enzyme, control and chymotrypsin-treated Triton X-114 extracts of Golgi membranes were examined by phase separation at 35 degrees C. The undigested enzyme partitioned into the detergent phase consistent with its location as an integral Golgi membrane protein, while the 110,000-dalton chymotrypsin-digested enzyme partitioned almost exclusively into the aqueous phase in a manner characteristic of a soluble protein. These results suggest that mannosidase II catalytic activity resides in a proteolytically resistant, hydrophilic 110,000-dalton domain. Attachment of this catalytic domain to the lumenal face of Golgi membranes is achieved by a proteolytically sensitive linkage to a 14,000-dalton hydrophobic membrane anchoring domain."
https://openalex.org/W1529356803,"The interaction of nonepithelial intermediate filament (IF) proteins with vesicles produced from total Ehrlich ascites tumor cell lipids results in the formation of complexes which in sucrose density gradient centrifugation attain positions distinctly different from those of the original reactants. In KBr density gradient equilibrium centrifugation, the IF protein-lipid adducts accumulate as thin proteolipid films on top of the KBr gradients, whereas in the absence of lipids the proteins remain distributed within the density gradients. Similar results were obtained with vesicles derived from individual phospholipids and a mixture thereof. The affinity of IF proteins for negatively charged phospholipids is greater than that for vesicles derived from uncharged phospholipids. Limited digestion of IF proteins with various proteinases demonstrated that for optimal association of the reactants IF proteins must carry an intact N terminus and that the isolated N-terminal polypeptide itself shows strong reactivity with lipid vesicles. Arginine-phosphate interactions between the N terminus and phospholipids seem to be partly responsible for this association. However, as shown by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl- and octyl-Sepharose 4B, IF proteins and their proteolytic derivatives also appear to have high affinities for aromatic and aliphatic substructures of biologically important molecules. The results are discussed in terms of a possible functional role of IF protein-lipid interactions in the association of nonepithelial intermediate filaments with intracellular membrane systems."
https://openalex.org/W1523398066,"Tubulins purified from brain tissue of Antarctic fishes assemble in vitro to form microtubules at the low temperatures experienced by these extreme psychrophiles (Williams, R. C., Jr., Correia, J. J., and DeVries, A. L. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 2790-2798). We have initiated studies to determine the structural requirements for assembly of Antarctic fish tubulins at low temperatures. As a first step we have compared the heterogeneity, structures, amino acid compositions, and net charge of brain tubulins purified from three Antarctic fishes (Notothenia gibberifrons, Notothenia coriiceps neglecta, and Chaenocephalus aceratus), from the temperate channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and from a mammal (the cow). Each preparation contained the alpha- and beta-tubulins and was free of microtubule-associated proteins. When examined by isoelectric focusing and by two-dimensional electrophoresis, brain tubulins from the Antarctic fishes were found to be highly heterogeneous; each was resolved into approximately 20 isoelectric variants. The distributions of the isotubulins from the cold-adapted fishes were similar but differed significantly from those of tubulins from catfish and cow. The average isoelectric points of the alpha- and beta-tubulins from the Antarctic fishes were more basic than the isoelectric points of the corresponding tubulins from bovine brain. Peptide mapping confirmed that tubulins from the Antarctic fishes and the mammal differed in structure. The amino acid compositions of fish and mammalian tubulins were similar, but Antarctic fish tubulins apparently contained fewer Glx residues than did catfish or bovine tubulins. Finally, native tubulins from an Antarctic fish and the cow differed slightly in net negative charge. Thus, brain tubulins from the cold-adapted fishes differ structurally from the tubulins of a temperate fish and of a mammal."
https://openalex.org/W1556073760,"The mechanism of dealkylation (aging) of branched-alkyl organophosphonyl conjugates of acetylcholinesterase and the consequence of this reaction on enzyme conformation were examined by employing kinetic, equilibrium, and spectroscopic techniques. Aging of cycloheptyl methylphosphono-acetylcholinesterase proceeded as a unimolecular reaction in which the enzyme became refractory to oxime reactivation and was accelerated with increases in temperature and decreases in pH and ionic strength of the medium. While aging occurred in a manner invariant with the nature of the salt in buffers containing Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+, Cl-, CH3COO-, SO2-(4), and PO3-(4), the influence of ionic strength on aging was opposite to that predicted for a mechanism requiring charge separation during formation of the polar transition state. Examination of the equilibrium enzyme conformation with decidium, a fluorescent active center-selective ligand, revealed marked alterations in ligand association and a greater ionic strength dependence for binding after aging. The explanation for this behavior focuses on the high net negative surface charge of the enzyme and proposes that acetylcholinesterase topography is governed by the strength of electrostatic interactions between charged, contiguous, mobile protein regions within the subunit. As such, these studies reveal a reciprocal relationship between acetylcholinesterase topography, surface charge, and ionic strength of the medium."
https://openalex.org/W1544764137,"Leucine aminopeptidase was purified from human liver cytosol to homogeneity, 1538-fold, with a yield of 84.4% by immunoaffinity chromatography. Increases in the activity and the stability of the enzyme were simultaneously observed during the purification procedure, suggesting the presence of some endogenous inhibitor in cytosol. The specific activity and Km value of the enzyme for L-leucine amide were found to be 58.00 mumol/min/mg of protein and 4.02 mM, respectively, at pH 8.0. The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined to be 360,000 by both polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis and Sephadex G-200 gel filtration. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of native and dimethyl suberimidate cross-linked enzyme indicate that the native enzyme has two subunits of Mr 53,000 (a) and 65,000 (b) and is a hexamer arranged as a trimer of dimers (3 X (a X b)). The optimum pH was 10.5, and the enzyme was stable in the pH range from 7.5-8.5. The enzyme was activated by divalent metal ions, especially by Mg2+ and Mn2+, with no change in Km value. The enzyme was inhibited by metal-chelating agents, indicating it to be a metalloenzyme. Amastatin and bestatin strongly inhibited the enzyme, but leupeptin did not. The enzyme had a broad substrate specificity toward oligopeptides and amino acid amides but had little or no activity toward chromogenic substrates. The enzyme also could hydrolyze natural substrates contained in liver cytosol and accordingly produce many kinds of amino acids commonly found in proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1594817985,"In order to further characterize chemical, physicochemical, and immunochemical properties, as well as structure-function relationships, of the common alpha subunit of human glycoprotein hormones, a tryptic core was prepared from the alpha subunit of human choriogonadotropin. The core was purified in greater than 80% yield using gel permeation and anion-exchange chromatography, and, following reduction and S-carboxymethylation, the constituent peptides were purified by gel permeation and high performance liquid chromatography. The disulfide-bridged peptides comprising the alpha core were identified as residues 1-35 and residues 52-91 by amino acid composition and amino acid carboxyl sequence analyses of the reduced, S-carboxymethylated peptides. The alpha tryptic core contained both N-asparagine carbohydrate moieties, but was devoid of residues 36-51 and the carboxyl-terminal serine at position 92. The small peptides cleaved from residues 36-51, a known potential O-glycosylation region of the alpha subunit, were purified and identified. The tryptic core retained full immunopotency relative to the intact subunit in the binding to polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against the alpha subunit. The region consisting of residues 36-51 is not part of the epitope recognized by these antibodies. With antisera generated to the reduced, S-carboxymethylated subunit, peptide 1-35, but not 52-91, was immunoreactive. This finding is consistent with the known dominant antigenicity of the amino-terminal region in the reduced, S-carboxymethylated molecule. The core exhibited no appreciable interaction with the complementary beta subunit, and, not surprisingly, was unable to compete with intact hormone binding in a radioreceptor assay using rat testicular homogenates. Circular dichroic spectroscopy was used to probe gross features of tertiary structure (240-300 nm) and secondary structure (190-240 nm). The tryptic core and each of the two constituent peptides exhibited spectra above 240 nm that resembled that of the reduced, S-carboxymethylated subunit more than that of the native material, thus suggesting a significant loss of tertiary structure in the core and isolated peptides. This finding is unexpected in consideration of the full retention of immunopotency by the alpha core although consistent with failure of the core to combine with intact complementary beta subunit. The intact subunit as well as the isolated constituent peptides exhibit little if any helicity in aqueous solution. Interestingly, the reduced, S-carboxymethylated chain and peptide 52-91 displayed helicity in 80% trifluoroethanol, a helicogenic solvent."
https://openalex.org/W1533218691,"Galactose oxidase is a fungal enzyme which is known to oxidize the C-6 hydroxymethyl of galactose to an aldehyde group. When the products of a galactose oxidase-catalase treatment of raffinose were examined by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, we found that, in addition to the expected 6''-aldehydoraffinose, two other components were present. Of these two components, the major one was retained on a column of AG 1-X8 (formate), gave a positive carbazole reaction for uronic acid, and on paper chromatograms had a mobility identical with that of 6''-carboxyraffinose. The infrared spectrum of the compound showed a carbonyl absorbance at 1725 cm-1 and was distinguishable from the spectra of raffinose and 6''-aldehydoraffinose. These data showed that raffinose was partly converted to 6''-carboxyraffinose when treated with galactose oxidase and catalase. The conversion of [3H]raffinose to [3H]6''-carboxyraffinose increased gradually with time of oxidation from 22% at 6 h to 68% at 96 h. Results of other experiments provided evidence that this was an enzymic conversion and depended on the presence of galactose oxidase. The activities responsible for the formation of aldehyde and uronic acid could not be separated by affinity chromatography, gel electrophoresis, or ion exchange chromatography, indicating that the same enzyme is responsible for both activities. Treatment of galactose, melibiose, and stachyose with galactose oxidase and catalase also resulted in the formation of the corresponding uronic acids. These studies indicate that galactose oxidase not only converts the C-6 hydroxymethyl group of galactose to an aldehyde group, but also catalyzes further oxidation to the carboxyl group."
https://openalex.org/W1609681988,"This study demonstrates the post-translational translocation across the rough endoplasmic reticular membrane of a mammalian secretory protein, human preplacental lactogen. In the rabbit reticulocyte lysate, human preplacental lactogen biosynthesis is arrested by addition of cycloheximide prior to supplementation with dog pancreatic microsomal membranes, which have previously been shown to translocate and process nascent secretory proteins in a cotranslational manner. Twenty-five percent of the precursor protein is consistently converted to its mature form under these post-translational conditions. The resulting mature hormone is resistant to proteolytic degradation by added proteases, thus indicating that it is translocated across the microsomal membrane and sequestered within the lumenal space of the microsomal vesicles. Approximately one-half of the precursor protein synthesized is associated with the ribosomes. Only the ribosome-associated fraction is secreted in this in vitro system, suggesting that the process of post-translational secretion requires ribosomes for protein interaction with the elements of a subcellular secretory apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1558865672,"Abstract Metallothioneins are low molecular weight, cysteine-rich proteins believed to participate in metal detoxification. Turnover of Cd-, Zn-, and Au-induced metallothionein was studied in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line which was resistant to Cd and the Au-containing drug auranofin. Cd, Zn, and Au were potent inducers of metallothionein mRNA and resulted in accumulation of approximately equal amounts of mRNA. Pulse-chase studies with [35S]cysteine revealed that the half-life of Au-, Zn-, and Cd-induced metallothionein was 0.75, 10, and 24 h, respectively. The differences in the half-life of metallothionein may be related to the tertiary structure of metal-metallothionein complexes. These results have implications in the mechanism of resistance to gold compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1536888913,"Using vesicle targets composed of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol (1:1 molar ratio), we found that Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PTx) binding and insertion are not only dependent on pH (Zalman, L.S., and Wisnieski, B.J. (1985) Infect. Immun. 50, 630-635) but also on ionic strength, reaching a maximum in pH 4 buffer that contains 150-200 mM NaCl. Insertion was monitored by photolabeling with an intramembranous probe. Higher levels of binding and insertion were attained with vesicles that contained 2.5 mol% dicetylphosphate than with neutral vesicles. Positively charged vesicles (2.7 mol% stearylamine) were the least effective targets. At pH 7.4, all binding levels were depressed. While PTx binding increased with increasing temperature, the relative proportion of the vesicle-associated toxin that was photolabeled decreased. The most likely explanation for the decrease is that the bilayer translocation rates increased with increasing temperature, and hence fewer PTx molecules were accessible at the time of photolabeling. At 37 degrees C, binding and insertion both plateaued within 10 min of lowering the pH to 4. After 10 min, the amount of bound toxin decreased slightly with time but there was a dramatic decrease in photolabeling, indicating that inserted PTx had begun to cross the bilayer. This was verified by the finding that when PTx was incubated with vesicles that contained trypsin, cleavage occurred only in those samples in which the pH was shifted down to pH 4. Entry is triggered by an acid-induced conformational change that promotes productive binding and insertion. After insertion, the kinetics of membrane traversal appear to be regulated by the physical properties of the bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1605011458,"Mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase is synthesized on free polysomes as a higher molecular weight precursor (Sonderegger, P., Jaussi, R., Christen, P., and Gehring, H. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3339-3345). The present study examines whether the coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate or pyridoxamine phosphate is required for the uptake of the precursor into mitochondria. Chicken embryo fibroblasts were cultured in medium prepared with and without pyridoxal. In cells grown in the presence of pyridoxal only holoform of aspartate aminotransferase and no apoenzyme was detected. Cells cultured under pyridoxal deficiency contained about 30% of apoenzyme in secondary cultures. All of this apoform was identified as mitochondrial isoenzyme. In order to differentiate whether this apoenzyme corresponded to newly synthesized protein or originated from pre-existing holoenzyme, double isotope-labeling experiments were performed. Secondary cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts grown under pyridoxal depletion were labeled with [3H]methionine, and then pulsed with [35S]methionine. In another series of experiments, the 3H-labeled cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine in the presence of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone in order to accumulate the precursor. Subsequently, the accumulated precursor was chased into the mitochondria by addition of the carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone antagonist cysteamine. The holo- and apoenzyme from the ultrasonic extract of the double-labeled cells were separated by affinity chromatography on a phosphopyridoxyl-AH-Sepharose column, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Under both experimental conditions, the 3H/35S ratio of the apoenzyme was less than half of that of the holoenzyme. Therefore, the apoenzyme and not the holoenzyme is the first product of the precursor in the mitochondria. Apparently, the precursor of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase is transported into mitochondria as apoprotein and is processed there independently of the coenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1595787614,"Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells were stimulated with thrombin (1 unit/ml) for 15-30 s and then lysed with a solution of Triton X-100 containing [gamma-32P]adenosine triphosphate. Thrombin-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells showed an enhanced incorporation of 32P into at least 12 different proteins as compared to control cells treated similarly. The observed enhanced phosphorylation required the active site of thrombin because diisopropylphosphoryl-thrombin had no effect on the level of phosphorylation. The molecular weight of one of the phosphoproteins was similar to that of the intermediate filament protein vimentin (55-60 kDa), a major protein in endothelial cells. This 59-kDa protein was Triton X-100-insoluble and reacted on a Western blot with antibody raised in guinea pig against Chinese hamster ovary cell vimentin. Addition of the anti-vimentin antibody to the thrombin-stimulated, phosphorylated lysate immuno-precipitated a single 32P-labeled protein (59 kDa). These results demonstrate that thrombin rapidly stimulates the phosphorylation of vimentin in cultured endothelial cells and links thrombin stimulation to the phosphorylation of a cytoskeletal protein."
https://openalex.org/W1597181974,"Our previous work showed that vitamin C deficiency caused about a 70-80% decrease in the incorporation of [35S]sulfate into proteoglycan of guinea pig costal cartilage, coordinately with a decrease in collagen synthesis (Bird, T. A., Spanheimer, R. G., and Peterkofsky, B. (1986) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 246, 42-51). We examined the mechanism for decreased proteoglycan synthesis by labeling normal and scorbutic cartilage in vitro with radioactive precursors. Proteoglycan monomers from scorbutic tissue were of a slightly smaller average hydrodynamic size than normal but there was no difference in the size of the glycosaminoglycan chains isolated after papain digestion. The type of glycosaminoglycans synthesized and the degree of sulfation were unaffected as determined by chondroitinase ABC digestion and duel labeling with [35S]sulfate and [3H]glucosamine. Conversion of [3H]glucosamine to [3H]galactosamine also was unimpaired. There was about a 40% decrease in core protein synthesis, measured by [14C]serine incorporation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Nevertheless, decreased incorporation of [35S]sulfate into scorbutic tissue persisted in the presence of p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xyloside and cycloheximide, which indicated that the site of the scorbutic defect was beyond core protein synthesis and xylosylation. Galactosyltransferase activity in scorbutic cartilage decreased to about one-third the levels in control samples in parallel with the decreases in proteoglycan and collagen synthesis. Our results suggest that the step catalyzed by this enzyme activity, the addition of galactose to xylose prior to chondroitin sulfate chain elongation, is the major site of the scorbutic defect in proteoglycan synthesis. Decreased enzyme activity may be related to increased cortisol levels in scorbutic serum."
https://openalex.org/W1621387100,"Nitrobacter agilis, which contains a very active nitrite dehydrogenase, was studied in vivo under anaerobic conditions by the 15N NMR technique. When incubated with equimolar 15NO3- and unlabeled nitrite (or 15NO2- and unlabeled nitrate) the bacterium catalyzed an isotope exchange reaction at rates about 10% those observed in the nitrite oxidase assay. When incubated with 18O-labeled 15NO2- and 18O-labeled 15NO3-, the 18O was observed to exchange at similar rates from both species into water. Finally, when incubated with equimolar [18O]nitrate and 15NO2-, intermolecular 18O transfer was observed to result in formation of double labeled nitrate and nitrite at similar rates. 18O was transferred from nitrate to a 15N species or to water at approximately equal rates under the conditions of the experiments. It is argued that the enzyme responsible for these exchange reactions is nitrite dehydrogenase and not nitrate reductase. This work and the related experiments of DiSpirito and Hooper (DiSpirito, A.A., and Hooper, A.B. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10534-10537) represent the first demonstrations of intermolecular oxygen atom transfer among oxotransferases. Mechanistic implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1574833915,"A variety of amino-substituted steroids were investigated as inhibitors of the rabbit hepatic, steroid 21-hydroxylase, cytochrome P-450 1. We reasoned that a steroid analog of pregnenolone capable of mimicking the binding of C21-steroids to the enzyme at the active site and bearing an amine moiety on the 17 beta-side chain would be a potent inhibitor if the amine were free to interact with the heme iron. Our studies reveal that 22-amino-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3 beta-ol (22-ABC) is a tightly-bound inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 1-catalyzed reactions (Ki less than 1 nM). Spectral differences elicited by 22-ABC indicate that when bound to the enzyme, the amine moiety of 22-ABC is coordinated to the heme iron. In contrast, several other hepatic cytochrome P-450s which mediate distinct regio-specific routes of metabolism for progesterone or pregnenolone remain largely unaffected at concentrations of 22-ABC that exceed by 2 orders of magnitude that required to inhibit cytochrome P-450 1. 22-ABC also inhibited the metabolism of benzo(a)pyrene attributable to cytochrome P-450 1 but did not inhibit that induced by treatment with rifampicin or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Analogs of 22-ABC bearing a hydroxyl group or a methylamine in place of the amine moiety exhibit lower affinities for cytochrome P-450 1. In addition, either increasing or decreasing the number of carbons of the side chain reduced the affinity of the inhibitor for cytochrome P-450 1."
https://openalex.org/W1498676317,Kinetic studies of the serum albumin-catalyzed reaction of cyanide with colloidal elemental sulfur have been carried out to elucidate the formal mechanism of this reaction. The results indicate that one of the several sulfur-binding sites on the protein molecule is involved in a single displacement catalytic cycle in the presence of cyanide. At high velocities the rate of thiocyanate production is limited by an albumin-independent second order process which produces the form of sulfur that serves as substrate. The catalyzed reaction is also subject to substrate inhibition at high colloidal sulfur concentrations.
https://openalex.org/W1520528275,"The possible structural changes of the calmodulin-trifluoperazine (TFP) complex caused by Ca2+ binding have been analyzed by microcalorimetric titrations. Titrations of calmodulin with Ca2+ in the presence of 8-fold molar excess TFP have been made both in the absence and presence of Mg2+, at pH 7.0, and at 5, 15, and 25 degrees C. At high concentrations of TFP calmodulin forms a complex with TFP even in the absence of Ca2+. The reaction of the calmodulin-TFP complex with Ca2+ is exothermic, both in the presence and absence of Mg2+. In the presence of Mg2+ the reaction is driven almost entirely by a favorable enthalpy change. The magnitudes of the hydrophobic and internal vibrational contributions to the heat capacity and entropy changes of this complex on Ca2+ binding have been estimated by the empirical method of Sturtevant (Sturtevant, J. M. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 2236-2240). In the presence of Mg2+, the vibrational as well as hydrophobic entropy is slightly increased in a parallel manner by Ca2+ binding to each of the binding sites. In contrast, when Mg2+ is absent, the hydrophobic entropy gradually increases on Ca2+ binding, but the vibrational entropy decreases. These changes of entropy indicate the assembling of non-polar groups on the surface of the complex and suggest that the overall structure is loosened in the presence of Mg2+, but tightened in the absence of Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W1533935480,"The 2',3'-dialdehyde derivative of NADPH (oNADPH) acts as a coenzyme for the reaction catalyzed by bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase. Incubation of 250 microM oNADPH with enzyme for 300 min at 30 degrees C and pH 8.0 yields covalent incorporation of 1.0 mol of oNADPH/mol of enzyme subunit. The modified enzyme has a functional catalytic site and is activated by ADP, but is no longer inhibited by high NADH concentrations and exhibits decreased sensitivity to GTP inhibition. Using the change in inhibition by 600 microM NADH or 1 microM GTP to monitor the reaction leads to rate constants of 44.0 and 41.5 min-1 M-1, respectively, suggesting that loss of inhibition by the two regulatory compounds results from reaction by oNADPH at a single location. The oNADPH incorporation is proportional to the decreased inhibition by 600 microM NADH or 1 microM GTP, extrapolating to less than 1 mol of oNADPH/mol of subunit when the maximum change in NADH or GTP inhibition has occurred. Modified enzyme is still 93% inhibited at saturating levels of GTP, although its K1 is increased 20-fold to 4.6 microM. The kinetic effects caused by oNADPH are not prevented by alpha-ketoglutarate, ADP, 5 mM NADH, or 200 microM GTP alone, but are prevented by 5 mM NADH with 200 microM GTP. Incorporation of oNADPH into enzyme at 255 min is 0.94 mol/mol of peptide chain in the absence of ligands but only 0.53 mol/mol of peptide chain in the presence of the protectants 5 mM NADH plus 200 microM GTP. These results indicate that oNADPH modifies specifically about 0.4-0.5 sites/enzyme subunit or about 3 sites/enzyme hexamer and that reaction occurs at a GTP-dependent inhibitory NADH site of glutamate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1507262946,"The pH dependence of the kinetics of the binding of cyanide ion to methemoglobins A and S and to guinea pig and pigeon methemoglobins appears to be not directly correlated with the net charges on the proteins. The kinetics can, however, be adequately explained in terms of three sets of heme-linked ionizable groups with pK1 ranging between 4.9 and 5.3, pK2 between 6.2 and 7.9, and pK3 between 8.0 and 8.5 at 20 degrees C. pK1 is assigned to carboxylic acid groups, pK2 to histidines and terminal amino groups, and pK3 to the acid-alkaline methemoglobin transition. Kinetic second order rate constants have also been determined for the binding of cyanide ion by the four sets of methemoglobin species present in solution. The pKi values and the rate constants of methemoglobin S are strikingly different from those of methemoglobin A. This result is explained in terms of different electrostatic contributions to the free energy of heme linkage arising from differences in the environments of ionizable groups at the surfaces of the two molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1538002170,"We investigated the mechanical properties of two abundant, cytoplasmic proteins from Acanthamoeba, profilin and actin, and found that while both profilin and nonfilamentous actin alone behaved as solids, mixtures of the two proteins were viscoelastic liquids. When allowed to equilibrate, profilin formed a viscoelastic solid with mechanical properties similar to filamentous and nonfilamentous actin. Consequently, profilin itself may contribute significantly to the elasticity and viscosity of cytoplasm. The addition of profilin to nonfilamentous actin caused a phase transition from gel (viscoelastic solid) to sol (viscoelastic liquid) when the concentration of free actin became too low to form a gel. In contrast, profilin had little effect on the rigidity and viscosity of actin filaments. We speculate that nonfilamentous actin and profilin, both of which form shear-sensitive structures, can be modeled as flocculant materials. We conclude that profilin may regulate the rigidity (elasticity) of the cytoplasm not only by inhibiting polymerization of actin, but also by modulating the mechanical properties of nonfilamentous actin."
https://openalex.org/W1496161255,"Raman spectra of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin obtained with 218 and 200 nm pulsed (7 ns) laser excitation show changes (loss of 880 cm-1 tryptophan band intensity, increase in the 830/850 cm-1 tyrosine doublet intensity ratio) which are attributed to the aromatic contacts (Trp beta 37-Tyr alpha 140 and Tyr alpha 42-Asp beta 99) that are specific to the T quaternary structure. At high concentration (2 mM in heme) HbCO shows the same spectral signatures as HbO2. As the HbCO concentration is decreased, however, the spectra approach those shown by deoxy-Hb. This dilution effect is attributable to photolysis, which increases with decreasing concentration. The results imply that the HbCO photoproduct shows the same aromatic environments as does deoxy-Hb. Thus, T-like contacts are apparently formed at the alpha 1 beta 2 interface within 7 ns of photolysis, a time short compared to the spectral alterations of the heme group (approximately 100 ns, approximately 1 microsecond, and approximately 20 microseconds) which have previously been attributed to tertiary and quaternary relaxations."
https://openalex.org/W1500584371,"Distances between the four Ca2+-binding sites of calmodulin (CaM) have been measured by fluorescence energy transfer techniques using Eu3+ and Tb3+ as energy donors and a number of other lanthanide ions (Ln3+) as acceptors. It was shown previously that lanthanide ions preferentially bind to sites I and II of CaM with an affinity higher than that for sites III and IV (Kilhoffer, M.-C., Demaille, J. G., and Gerald, D. (1980) FEBS Lett. 116, 269-272; Wang, C.-L. A., Aquaron, R. R., Leavis, P. C., and Gergely, J. (1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 124, 7-12). Thus upon direct excitation with a laser the luminescence lifetimes of Eu1Ln1CaM and Tb1Ln1CaM provide information on the distance between sites I and II. On the other hand, since Tb3+ ions bound to sites III and IV are sensitizable through tyrosine residues, lifetime measurements of Tb2Ln2CaM excited by UV light yield the distance between sites III and IV. Both pairs of sites were found to be separated by a distance of 1.05 +/- 0.07 nm. Binding of Ca2+ to sites III and IV does not alter the distance between sites I and II. We have also attached a chromophoric label, dimethylaminophenylazobenzene, to Cys-133 of skeletal troponin I and carried out distance measurements on its complex with CaM by both direct and indirect excitation. The averaged distances from sites I and II in the N-terminal half and from sites III and IV in the C-terminal half of the CaM molecule to the label on troponin I are 2.7 and 2.5 nm, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1604553136,"Chymodenin, a hormone-like duodenal peptide which rapidly alters the proportions of secreted pancreatic digestive enzymes to a mixture relatively richer in chymotrypsinogen than that found in basal secretion, has been purified to homogeneity. The starting material was an acidic methanol-soluble, neutral pH-insoluble fraction of an acetic acid extract of porcine duodenum; the purification consisted of cation-exchange chromatography on SP-Sephadex and CM-Sephadex in ammonium bicarbonate gradients, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 in dilute acetic acid. The yield of material was followed by radioimmunoassay. Homogeneity was determined from chymodenin's behavior in disc gel electrophoresis in an acidic counter-migration-of-dye system, sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gels, gel filtration, dansyl-Edman reaction, reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, isotachophoresis, and sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation. The electrophoretic mobility, the molecular weight of 9,000-10,000, and the biological activity differed from those of other gastrointestinal peptide hormones. The amino acid composition was unique. Chymodenin is the first purified hormone-like substance reported capable of altering the composition of the mixture of secreted digestive enzymes, independent of the stimulation of massive pancreatic protein output."
