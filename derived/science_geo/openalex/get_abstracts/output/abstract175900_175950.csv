https://openalex.org/W2114736117,"Stem cells within the bone marrow (BM) exist in a quiescent state or are instructed to differentiate and mobilize to circulation following specific signals. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), induced in BM cells, releases soluble Kit-ligand (sKitL), permitting the transfer of endothelial and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the quiescent to proliferative niche. BM ablation induces SDF-1, which upregulates MMP-9 expression, and causes shedding of sKitL and recruitment of c-Kit+ stem/progenitors. In MMP-9-/- mice, release of sKitL and HSC motility are impaired, resulting in failure of hematopoietic recovery and increased mortality, while exogenous sKitL restores hematopoiesis and survival after BM ablation. Release of sKitL by MMP-9 enables BM repopulating cells to translocate to a permissive vascular niche favoring differentiation and reconstitution of the stem/progenitor cell pool."
https://openalex.org/W2171857030,"We have investigated the mechanisms of leading edge formation in chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells. We demonstrate that while phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) transiently translocates to the plasma membrane in response to chemoattractant stimulation and to the leading edge in chemotaxing cells, PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K pathways, exhibits a reciprocal pattern of localization. By uniformly localizing PI3K along the plasma membrane, we show that chemotaxis pathways are activated along the lateral sides of cells and PI3K can initiate pseudopod formation, providing evidence for a direct instructional role of PI3K in leading edge formation. These findings provide evidence that differential subcellular localization and activation of PI3K and PTEN is required for proper chemotaxis."

Disruption of the PI 3-phosphatase, PTEN, in Dictyostelium discoideum dramatically prolonged and broadened the PH domain relocation and actin polymerization responses, causing the cells lacking PTEN to follow a circuitous route toward the attractant. Exogenously expressed PTEN-GFP localized to the surface membrane at the rear of the cell. Membrane localization required a putative PI(4,5)P2 binding motif and was required for chemotaxis. These results suggest that specific phosphoinositides direct actin polymerization to the cell's leading edge and regulation of PTEN through a feedback loop plays a critical role in gradient sensing and directional migration."
https://openalex.org/W2127109439,"A Yersinia effector known as YopT and a Pseudomonas avirulence protein known as AvrPphB define a family of 19 proteins involved in bacterial pathogenesis. We show that both YopT and AvrPphB are cysteine proteases, and their proteolytic activities are dependent upon the invariant C/H/D residues conserved in the entire YopT family. YopT cleaves the posttranslationally modified Rho GTPases near their carboxyl termini, releasing them from the membrane. This leads to the disruption of actin cytoskeleton in host cells. The proteolytic activity of AvrPphB is essential for autoproteolytic cleavage of an AvrPphB precursor as well as for eliciting the hypersensitive response in plants. These findings provide new insights into mechanisms of animal and plant pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2021657723,"Changes in the concentration of malonyl-CoA in many tissues have been related to alterations in the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the rate-limiting enzyme in its formation. In contrast, little is known about the physiological role of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD), an enzyme responsible for malonyl-CoA catabolism. In this study, we examined the effects of voluntary exercise on MCD activity in rat liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. In addition, the activity ofsn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), which like MCD and ACC can be regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), was assayed. Thirty min after the completion of a treadmill run, MCD activity was increased ∼2-fold, malonyl-CoA levels were reduced, and ACC and GPAT activities were diminished by 50% in muscle and liver. These events appeared to be mediated via activation of AMPK since: 1) AMPK activity was concurrently increased by exercise in both tissues; 2) similar findings were observed after the injection of 5-amino 4 imidazole carboxamide, an AMPK activator; 3) changes in the activity of GPAT and ACC paralleled that of MCD; and 4) the increase in MCD activity in muscle was reversed in vitro by incubating immunoprecipitated enzyme from the exercised muscle with protein phosphatase 2A, and it was reproduced by incubating immunopurified MCD from resting muscle with purified AMPK. An unexpected finding was that exercise caused similar changes in the activities of ACC, MCD, GPAT, and AMPK and the concentration of malonyl-CoA in adipose tissue. In conclusion: MCD, GPAT, and ACC are coordinately regulated by AMPK in liver and adipose tissue in response to exercise, and except for GPAT, also in muscle. The results suggest that AMPK activation plays a major role in regulating lipid metabolism in many cells following exercise. They also suggest that in each of them, it acts to increase fatty acid oxidation and decrease its esterification.

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). One factor governing the concentration of malonyl-CoA is acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC),1 the rate-limiting enzyme in its synthesis. ACC is subject to both allosteric and covalent (by phosphorylation) regulation, and in some tissues, to changes in its abundance. A multitude of studies in such tissues as liver and muscle have clearly shown that increases and decreases in malonyl-CoA levels correlate closely with changes in ACC activity (2McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 3Winder W.W. Maclean P.S. Lucas J.C. Fernley J.E. Tumble G.E. J. Appl.

It is less clear whether malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD), an enzyme that degrades malonyl-CoA, also regulates its concentration under physiological conditions. Recent studies suggest that the concentration of malonyl-CoA in liver and muscle in certain circumstances correlates inversely with changes in MCD activity. Thus, increases in MCD activity have been observed in rat liver during starvation (5Dyck J.R. Berthainme L.G. Thomas P.D. Kautor P.F. Barr A.J. Barr R. Singh D. Hopkins T.A. Voilley N. Prentki M. Lopaschuk G.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and in skeletal muscle (6Saha A.K. Schwarsin A.J. Roduit R. Masse F. Kaushik V. Tornheim K. Prentki M. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24279-24283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) in response to electrically induced contractions. In the latter situation, the increase in activity was attributable to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that also phosphorylates and inhibits ACC. Despite this, the physiological role of MCD in regulating the concentration of malonyl-CoA remains open to question as are the mechanisms by which its activity is regulated (7Habinowski S.A. Hirshman M. Sakamoto K. Kemp B.E. Gould S.J. Goodyear L.J. Witters L.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The present study explores the effect of voluntary exercise on MCD activity in rat liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue and how observed changes relate temporally to alterations in the activities of ACC, AMPK, and glycerophosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), another enzyme shown previously to be regulated by AMPK (16Muoio D.M. Seefeld K. Witters L.A. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and malonyl-CoA concentration. In addition, the response to exercise was compared with that following the administration in vivo of the AMPK activator 5-amino 4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAR), and in skeletal muscle, the effect of purified AMPK on MCD activity was examined in vitro. Finally, since it has recently been suggested that measurements of MCD activity may vary with the assay used (7Habinowski S.A. Hirshman M. Sakamoto K. Kemp B.E. Gould S.J. Goodyear L.J. Witters L.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), in some studies, results obtained with spectrophotometric and radiometric methods were compared. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing ∼245–275 g, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). They were randomly distributed into two groups designated rest and exercise. All rats were run for 5 min/day at 15 m/min up a 30% grade on a rodent treadmill (Economical Exercise Treadmill Model Exer-4, Columbus Instruments International Corporation, Columbus, OH) for 1 week to acclimate them to handling and to running on the treadmill. They were housed in individual cages in a temperature-controlled room (22 ± 1 °C) on a 12:12 h light-dark cycle and provided water and Purina rat chowad libitum. On the day of experimentation, one group remained sedentary, and the other ran on a rodent treadmill at 21 m/min up a 12% grade for 30 min. All rats were then injected intraperitoneally with sodium pentobarbital (6 mg/100 g of body weight) at rest or immediately after exercise. Subsequently, samples of blood were taken via orbital sinus puncture; the gastrocnemius muscle, liver, and white adipose tissue were excised and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen; and the rats were sacrificed by exsanguination. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 320-360 g, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. They were fedad libitum and maintained in a temperature-controlled animal facility with light-dark cycles of 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Food intake was monitored. Body weight was assessed weekly at time of day. Rats were anesthetized and sacrificed between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., 2 h after AICAR (250 mg/kg of body weight) injection. Control rats were injected with a comparable volume of saline. Plasma insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay with a rat insulin standard (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO), and plasma glucose was determined by the hexokinase method (8Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1972: 174-177Google Scholar). Malonyl-CoA in muscle and liver was measured by the radioisotopic method described by McGarry et al. (9McGarry J.D. Stark M.J. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8291-8293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as modified in our laboratory (10Chien D. Dean D Saha A.K. Flatt J.P. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E259-E265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Saha A.K. Kurowski T.G. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E283-E289PubMed Google Scholar). Adipose tissue malonyl-CoA was determined by the same method after treatment of the perchloric acid tissue extract with chloroform/methanol to remove lipid as described by Denton and Randle (12Denton R.M Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1966; 100: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Partial purification of MCD in liver and adipose tissue was carried out by a modification of the method of Dyck et al.(5Dyck J.R. Berthainme L.G. Thomas P.D. Kautor P.F. Barr A.J. Barr R. Singh D. Hopkins T.A. Voilley N. Prentki M. Lopaschuk G.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen liver or adipose tissue was powdered in liquid nitrogen, and ∼200 mg of tissue was homogenized in a glass homogenizer in 30 volumes of a buffer composed of 0.1 mTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm aprotonin, 5 μm leupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin, 40 mm NaF, 4 mmNaPPi, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Tissue homogenates were then centrifuged at 500 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C. A small volume of filtrate was saved for determination of protein concentration by the method of Bradford (13Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. MCD was partially purified from the remaining supernatant by adding (NH4)2SO4 until 40% saturation was achieved. The mixture was stirred for 1 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from this spin was aspirated and treated with additional (NH4)2SO4 until 55% saturation was achieved. The mixture was then recentrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resultant pellet was reconstituted in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and stored at 4 °C until assayed. Supernatants (500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C) from frozen muscles (300–350 μg of muscle) were purified by immunoprecipitation as described previously (6Saha A.K. Schwarsin A.J. Roduit R. Masse F. Kaushik V. Tornheim K. Prentki M. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24279-24283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibody from rabbits immunized with the N-terminal region of MCD, which lacks both peroxisomal and mitochondrial targeting sequences, was used (14Voilley N. Roduit R. Vicaretti R. Bonny C. Waeber G. Dyck J.R. Lopaschuk G.D. Prentki M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In one study, a C-terminal MCD antibody, the C-terminal part of the enzyme ending with a peroxisomal targeting motif, was also used. In most studies, MCD activity was measured fluorometrically using a Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (6Saha A.K. Schwarsin A.J. Roduit R. Masse F. Kaushik V. Tornheim K. Prentki M. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24279-24283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 341 and 455 nm, respectively, to generate a 70–90% deflection. In addition, the photomultiplier voltage was set at 700 V to provide the greatest sensitivity. A reaction mixture was prepared in a cuvette by adding 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.6 mm NAD+, 1.0 μm malate, and malate dehydrogenase (74 units). Fluorescence was then measured, and upon obtaining temperature equilibration, citrate synthase (1.7 units) was added to the reaction mixture. Once equilibrium was established, 300 μmmalonyl-CoA was added, and another baseline measurement was obtained. Subsequently, the immunopurified enzyme or the enzyme purified by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation was added, and the rate of reaction was measured from the change in fluorescence. For each sample, an identical reaction mixture lacking exogenous malonyl-CoA was used as a control. Results are expressed per mg of protein in the 500 × g tissue supernatant. A radiometric MCD assay (14Voilley N. Roduit R. Vicaretti R. Bonny C. Waeber G. Dyck J.R. Lopaschuk G.D. Prentki M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was also used for measurement of MCD activity. The 500 × gsupernatant of the muscle homogenate was incubated for 10 min in the standard reaction mixture containing 0.5 mmmalonyl-CoA. The reaction was stopped by adding perchloric acid, and the precipitated proteins were sedimented by centrifugation. The incorporation of acetyl-CoA, formed by the MCD reaction, into [14C]citrate was determined by coupled enzymatic reactions in which [14C]aspartate was first converted to [14C]oxaloacetate with glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, and then citrate synthase was added to cause the [14C]oxaloacetate to react with the acetyl-CoA to form [14C]citrate. In the final step of the process, unreacted [14C]aspartate and [14C]citrate were separated by stirring the solution into a 1:2 (w/v) suspension of Dowex 50W-8X9 (100–200 mesh) and centrifuging the mixture at 44 ×g for 10 min. MCD activity, expressed as nmol of acetyl-CoA formed/min/mg of muscle supernatant protein, was quantified by comparison with acetyl-CoA standards. Muscle and liver extracts for assaying AMPK were prepared as described by Kaushik et al. (15Kaushik V.K. Young M.E. Dean D.J. Kurowski T.G. Saha A.K. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E335-E340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AMPK was immunoprecipitated from a 500 × g supernatant fraction (12 min) of muscle and liver with nonimmune sera or with specific antisera directed against the α1 or α2catalytic subunit of the AMPK heterotrimer. Immunoprecipitates were then collected on A/G beads and washed extensively. The immobilized enzyme was assayed as described previously (4Vavvas D. Apazidis A Saha A.K. Gamble J. Patel A. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13255-13261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In brief, 50 μl of reaction mixture was added to the immunoprecipitates, and 25 μl of the resultant mixture was then spotted on p81 filter paper, which was washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid-1% sodium pyrophosphate. It was not possible to assay immunopurified AMPK activity in adipose tissue for reasons not determined. Therefore, AMPK activity in adipose tissue was determined in an ammonium sulfate fraction prepared as for the ACC assay. ACC activity in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue was assayed as described by Vavvas et al. (4Vavvas D. Apazidis A Saha A.K. Gamble J. Patel A. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13255-13261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Tissues were ground to a powder under liquid nitrogen. The frozen powder was weighed (0.2 g) and then homogenized (4Vavvas D. Apazidis A Saha A.K. Gamble J. Patel A. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13255-13261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The homogenate was immediately centrifuged at 13,500 × g for 12 min. The ACC was precipitated from the supernatant by the addition of 144 mg of ammonium sulfate/ml and stirred on ice for 30 min. The precipitate was then collected by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was dissolved in 10% of the original volume of homogenizing buffer (see “MCD Assay”), and recentrifuged to remove insoluble protein. The supernatant was used for determination of ACC activity. Glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) was assayed with 300 μm [3H]glycerol-3-P and 80 μmpalmitoyl-CoA in the presence or absence of 1 mmN-ethylmaleimide to inhibit the microsomal isoform as described by Muoio et al. (16Muoio D.M. Seefeld K. Witters L.A. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Results are presented as the incorporation of [3H]glycerol-3-P into lysophosphatidate in the presence of palmitoyl-CoA (16Muoio D.M. Seefeld K. Witters L.A. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 10 min. Microsomal GPAT was estimated by subtracting theN-ethylmaleimide-resistant activity (mitochondrial GPAT) from the total. Muscle supernatant was immunoprecipitated and incubated at 37 °C with or without purified AMPK (kindly provided by Dr. Lee Witters) (1 microunit, where 1 unit equals 1 μmol of phosphate transferred per minute to the SAMS peptide) and 0.2 mm ATP and Mg2+ for different time periods as indicated in the legend for Fig. 4. For the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (5 units of the catalytic subunit of bovine heart cAMP-dependent protein kinase, Sigma) and casein kinase II (5 units of the rat liver casein kinase II, Sigma) studies, the reaction mixture was the same as for AMPK. MCD activity was determined as described previously. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical differences between multiple groups were determined by the Student’st test, where p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Malonyl-CoA levels and MCD, GPAT, and ACC activities were measured in tissues of sedentary rats and rats that had run on a treadmill for 30 min. All samples were taken 30 min after the completion of the exercise. Mean plasma glucose levels were higher in exercised than in sedentary rats (8.3 ± 0.2 mmversus 6.2 ± 0.15 mm). In contrast, plasma insulin levels tended to be lower in the exercised group (0.4 ± 0.16 ng/ml versus 0.6 ± 0.14 ng/ml), although the difference was not statistically significant. The concentration of malonyl-CoA and the activity of ACC in the gastrocnemius muscle decreased by 50% after treadmill running (Fig.1) in agreement with previous findings by Winder et al. (17Winder W.W. Arogyasami J. Barton J. Elayan I.M. Vehrs P.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1989; 67: 2230-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Winder W.W. Arogyasami J. Elayan I.M. Cartmill D. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E266-E271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Concurrently, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity was increased nearly 2-fold from 5.0 ± 0.5 nmol/min/mg of muscle supernatant protein at rest to 9.7 ± 0.4 nmol/min/mg (p < 0.05) after exercise (Fig. 1). A similar pattern of events was observed in liver, in which exercise increased MCD activity 2-fold and caused the concentration of malonyl-CoA and ACC activity to decrease by 50% (Fig. 1), and in epididymal adipose tissue, in which exercise increased MCD activity by 70% and decreased the concentration of malonyl-CoA and the activity of ACC by 40–60% (Fig. 1). The effects of exercise on AMPK activity in the three tissues are shown in Fig. 2. The activities of both the α1 and α2 AMPK isoforms increased in response to exercise in both liver and muscle with predominantly α1-AMPK increasing in liver and α2-AMPK in muscle (Fig. 2). In adipose tissue, in which we were unable to immunopurify the individual isoforms, total AMPK activity was increased by 50% (Fig. 2) Mitochondrial GPAT activity in gastrocnemius muscle was not affected by exercise. In contrast, liver mitochondrial GPAT activity was diminished by 50% after exercise, as was mitochondrial GPAT activity in adipose tissue (Fig. 3). Exercise did not affect microsomal GPAT activity in any of the tissues examined Previously, it was shown that AICAR administration diminishes the concentration of malonyl-CoA in liver and muscle (19Holmes B.F. Kurth-Kraczek E.J. Winder W.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 1999; 87: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 20Merrill G.F Kurth E.J Hardie D.G Winder W.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E1107-E1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we found that the subcutaneous administration of AICAR (250 mg/kg of body weight) decreased the concentration of malonyl-CoA in epididymal fat from 14 ± 1.2 nmol/g to 7.6 ± 0.5 nmol/g (TableI). In addition, it caused alteration in the activities of ACC, MCD, and GPAT in the three tissues very similar to those observed 30 min after exercise.Table IEffect of 2-h treatment of various tissues with AICAR on ACC, MCD, and GPAT activitiesTreatmentMuscleLiverEpididymal fatControlAICARControlAICARControlAICARACC8 ± 24 ± 1**12 ± 2.57 ± 1.2*26 ± 614 ± 2*MCD3.2 ± 0.56 ± 1.7**5.4 ± 0.311 ± 1.7*0.8 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.2**GPATNDND1.6 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.1**Fed rats (about 330 g) were anesthetized and sacrificed between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., 2 h after AICAR (250 mg/kg of body weight) injection.

Fig.4 shows that incubation of immunopurified MCD from the gastrocnemius of a sedentary rat with purified AMPK led to a 2-fold increase in MCD activity by 60 min. Further changes did not occur after longer periods of incubation. Incubation of immunopurified MCD with cAMP-dependent protein kinase and casein kinase II also activated MCD but to a substantially lesser extent and more slowly than did AMPK. When MCD immunoprecipitates from the gastrocnemius muscle taken 30 min after the completion of the exercise bout were treated with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A, 200 milliunits), the observed increase in enzyme activity was markedly reduced (Fig.5). This effect of PP2A was prevented by adding the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid to the medium. Fig.6 shows that the effect of incubation with AMPK on the activity of immunopurified MCD varied between muscles. Thus, MCD activity was increased by 100% in the extensor digitorum longus and by 70% in the gastrocnemius muscle but not significantly in the soleus.Figure 6Activation of immunopurified MCD by AMPK in different muscle types in vitro. Immunopurified MCD from gastrocnemius, soleus, and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with or without purified AMPK (1 microunit) and 0.2 mm AMP for 2 h.

As shown in Fig. 5, PP2A had an identical effect on MCD activity after exercise. We also measured MCD activity by a radiometric assay in 500 × gsupernatants of muscle homogenates taken after 5 min of contraction induced by electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve. MCD activity was increased 2–3-fold in the electrically stimulated muscle (0.37 ± 0.09 versus 0.97 ± 0.25 nmol/min/mg of protein, n = 6), an increase in activity similar to that obtained previously when a spectrophotometric assay was used (see Ref. 6Saha A.K. Schwarsin A.J. Roduit R. Masse F. Kaushik V. Tornheim K. Prentki M. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24279-24283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar and “Discussion”). The principal findings of this study are as follows. 1) After exercise, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase participates with acetyl-CoA carboxylase in regulating the concentration of malonyl-CoA in liver and adipose tissue, as well as in muscle. 2) In all three tissues, the activities of MCD and ACC are coordinately regulated by AMPK. 3) GPAT activity is diminished in liver and adipose tissue after exercise, and this too appears to be regulated by AMPK. 4) The net effect of these changes should be to increase the oxidation of fatty acids and to diminish their esterification. Previous studies have shown that the concentration of malonyl-CoA is decreased in skeletal muscle after exercise as a result of a decrease in ACC activity (17Winder W.W. Arogyasami J. Barton J. Elayan I.M. Vehrs P.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1989; 67: 2230-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Winder W.W. Arogyasami J. Elayan I.M. Cartmill D. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E266-E271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They have also suggested that the latter results from activation of AMPK, which phosphorylates and inhibits ACC. The results of the present study indicate that voluntary exercise also increases the activity of MCD and that this too is secondary to a change in AMPK activity. Thus, at the same time that decreases in ACC activity and malonyl-CoA concentration and an increase in AMPK activity were observed in muscle (30 min after a treadmill run), the activity of MCD was increased by 2-fold. The finding that the increase in MCD activity was reproduced by administration of AICAR in vivois consistent with this notion, as is the observation that incubation of immunopurified MCD from a sedentary muscle with purified AMPK produced a substantial increase in MCD activity. Such a coordinate regulation of ACC and MCD attributable to AMPK has also been observed in rat muscle made to contract by electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve in vivo and following incubation of the rat extension digitorum longus muscle with the AMPK activator AICAR (6Saha A.K. Schwarsin A.J. Roduit R. Masse F. Kaushik V. Tornheim K. Prentki M. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24279-24283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). As with MCD isolated from these muscles, treatment of immunopurified enzyme from an exercised muscle with PP2A reversed the increase in MCD activity. Interestingly, increases in MCD and AMPK activity and decreases in ACC activity and malonyl-CoA concentration were also observed in liver and adipose tissue at 30 min after exercise. That AMPK activity was increased in liver and fat at 30 min after exercise was surprising since one would not expect changes in ATP and AMP levels at this time in these tissues, if they occurred at all. Decreases in ACC activity and malonyl-CoA concentration associated with an increase in AMPK have been observed by Carlson and Winder (21Carlson C.L. Winder W.W. J. Appl Physiol. 1999; 86: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in rat liver immediately after the completion of a 20-min treadmill run; however, they did not observe a similar change after 2 h of intense exercise (21Carlson C.L. Winder W.W. J. Appl Physiol. 1999; 86: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). MCD was not measured nor were studies carried out well after the termination of the exercise as was done here. Another possibility is that these changes in liver and adipose tissue, and possibly also in muscle, are mediated by increases in catecholamines, which have long been known to occur during exercise (22Christensen N.J. Galbo H. Hansen J.F. Hesse B. Richter E.A. Trap-Jensen J. Diabetes. 1979; 28 Suppl. 1: 58-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, Minokoshi et al. (23Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G.D. Muller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that a leptin infusionin vivo causes an increase in AMPK activity in mouse skeletal muscle that is inhibited by the α-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine. In addition, Moule and Denton (24Moule S.E. Denton R.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) have shown that incubation with isoproterenol causes an increase in AMPK in incubated adipocytes, and we have found a similar effect of isoproterenol in skeletal muscle. 2V. Kaushik, A. Saha, and N. Ruderman, unpublished data. Whatever the precise mechanism, the findings raise the interesting possibility that exercise via its action on AMPK could also exert long term effects on metabolism, signal transduction, and gene expression in adipose tissue and liver as well as muscle (19Holmes B.F. Kurth-Kraczek E.J. Winder W.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 1999; 87: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 25Winder W.W. Holmes B.F. Rubink D.S. Jensen E.B. Chen M. Holloszy J. Appl.

In this context, AMPK has been implicated in the regulation of the expression of various genes including those encoding gluconeogenic enzymes in liver (27Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarchand P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and the GLUT-4 glucose transporter in muscle (28Ojuka E.O Nolte L.A Holloszy J.O. J. Appl Physiol. 2000; 88: 1072-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A novel finding in this study was that prior exercise also resulted in a significant decrease in mitochondrial-associated GPAT activity in liver and adipose tissue. An earlier study by Muoio et al.(16Muoio D.M. Seefeld K. Witters L.A. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) showing inhibition of hepatic GPAT activity by AMPK is consistent with this finding. Interestingly, GPAT activity in muscle was not diminished after exercise. Whether this was a technical problem related to the fact that its activity was much lower than that in either liver or adipose tissue remains to be determined. A very low activity of GPAT in muscle was also found by Muoio et al. (16Muoio D.M. Seefeld K. Witters L.A. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), who suggested that this accounted for their inability to demonstrate an effect of AICAR on GPAT activity in this tissue although it substantially inhibited triglyceride synthesis. Overall the results suggest that MCD, ACC, and GPAT are coordinately regulated by AMPK in liver, adipose tissue, and possibly in muscle after exercise (Fig. 7). The net effect of these events would be to enhance fatty acid oxidation and diminish its esterification. It has long been known that both fatty acid oxidation and esterification are altered in muscle during moderate intensity exercise (29Wolfe R.R. Klein S. Carraro F. Weber J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E382-E389PubMed Google Scholar) and that fatty acid oxidation in muscle is increased after exercise, when the muscle cell uses glucose predominantly to replete its glycogen stores. AMPK activation would presumably enhance glycogen repletion after exercise since it also increases glucose transport into muscle (20Merrill G.F Kurth E.J Hardie D.G Winder W.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E1107-E1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Fujii N. Habinowski S.A. Witters L.A. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and if anything, it enhances glycogen synthesis (30Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Fujii N. Habinowski S.A. Witters L.A. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 31Dean D.J. Kurowski T. Kaushik V. Brady M. Ruderman N.B. Diabetes. 2001; 50 (abstr.): 222Google Scholar). The precise effects of AMPK activation in liver and adipose tissue after exercise are less clear, although one would predict that it increases fatty acid oxidation and inhibits triglyceride synthesis in both tissues (29Wolfe R.R. Klein S. Carraro F. Weber J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E382-E389PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wahrenberg H. Engfeldt P. Bolinder J. Arner P. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: E383-E390PubMed Google Scholar). In adipose tissue, the latter effect would make more fatty acid, derived from lipolysis, available for release into the circulation, where it would provide for the fuel needs of muscle and liver. In an earlier study, we found that contractions induced by electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve caused a 2–3-fold increase in MCD activity in rat gastrocnemius muscle (6Saha A.K. Schwarsin A.J. Roduit R. Masse F. Kaushik V. Tornheim K. Prentki M. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24279-24283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Recently Habinowski et al. (7Habinowski S.A. Hirshman M. Sakamoto K. Kemp B.E. Gould S.J. Goodyear L.J. Witters L.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) carried out a similar study in which they were unable to reproduce this finding. They attributed this to the fact that they utilized a radiometric assay for MCD that was more specific than the spectrophotometric assay used by us (5Dyck J.R. Berthainme L.G. Thomas P.D. Kautor P.F. Barr A.J. Barr R. Singh D. Hopkins T.A. Voilley N. Prentki M. Lopaschuk G.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Goodwin G.W. Taegtmeyer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E772-E777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As reported here, we also observed 2–3-fold increases in MCD activity following electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve when the radiometric method was used to assay MCD. The reason for the different results in the two studies is unclear, but it could reflect the fact that we assayed MCD in a 500 × g cell supernatant, whereas Habinowski et al. (7Habinowski S.A. Hirshman M. Sakamoto K. Kemp B.E. Gould S.J. Goodyear L.J. Witters L.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) used a whole homogenate that may contain factor(s) interfering with the assay. In keeping with this notion, Goodwin and Taegtmeyer (33Goodwin G.W. Taegtmeyer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E772-E777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who showed increased MCD activity in hypoxic myocardium, and Dycket et al. (5Dyck J.R. Berthainme L.G. Thomas P.D. Kautor P.F. Barr A.J. Barr R. Singh D. Hopkins T.A. Voilley N. Prentki M. Lopaschuk G.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), who observed changes in MCD activity in liver during starvation and refeeding, both utilized tissue supernatant fractions for their assays. In conclusion, MCD, ACC, and GPAT appear to be coordinately regulated following exercise by an increase in AMPK activity in liver and epididymal fat, and except for GPAT, in muscle. Such changes would both increase the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids and decrease their use for the synthesis of triglycerides and other glycerolipids. Still to be determined are the factors responsible for the increase in AMPK activity in the three tissues and whether the prolonged increase in AMPK activity following exercise leads to changes in the expression of genes encoding key enzymes of lipid partitioning and other proteins. We thank Dr. Lee Witters of Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH for providing purified AMPK."

Such BAs bound to sites flanking a reporter gene establish a nonsilenced domain within the silent mating-type locus HML. Interestingly, various proteins involved in nuclear-cytoplasmic traffic, such as exportins Cse1p, Mex67p, and Los1p, exhibit a robust BA. Genetic studies, immunolocalization, live imaging, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that these transport proteins block spreading of heterochromatin by physical tethering of the HML locus to the Nup2p receptor of the nuclear pore complex. Genetic deletion of NUP2 abolishes the BA of all transport proteins, while direct targeting of Nup2p to the bracketing DNA elements restores activity. The data demonstrate that physical tethering of genomic loci to the NPC can dramatically alter their epigenetic activity."

Microheterogeneity of the plasma membrane could be studied using morphological and biophysical approaches, because the cell surface is readily accessible to probes and agents added from the medium. These studies revealed that, in addition to the fluid glycerophospholipid-rich regions of the bilayer, the plasma membrane also contains liquid-ordered regions rich in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (rafts), in which glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins and double-acylated proteins seem to preferentially partition. Lipid rafts are believed to act as cell surface platforms involved in internalization, signaling, and infection by pathogens and also to facilitate protein sorting in the biosynthetic pathway (1Kurzchalia T.V.

However, it has been extremely difficult to study putative intracellular lipid domains without using perturbing agents, e.g. methyl-β-cyclodextrin to deplete cholesterol, or detergents, including CHAPS1 (4Kurzchalia T.V.

Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). Hence, very little is known about the biophysical properties and lipid or protein composition of membrane domains presumably present in endocytic and biosynthetic organelles. In the endocytic pathway, molecules internalized into early endosomes are either recycled back to the plasma membranes or transported to late endosomes and lysosomes for degradation. Evidence is accumulating that some lipids are not randomly distributed in endosomal membranes along these recycling and degradation routes, contributing to the notion that endosomes contain a mosaic of structural and functional membrane domains (7Gruenberg J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In particular, raft lipids seem to be abundant in recycling endosomes, at least in some cell types (8Gagescu R. Demaurex N. Parton R.G. Hunziker W. Huber L. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2775-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, lipid analogs with a preference for ordered membrane domains were reported to be transported toward late endosomes, in contrast to those with a preference for more fluid domains (9Mukherjee S. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1271-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, which interacts with proteins containing a FYVE or a PX domain (10Simonsen A. Wurmser A.E. Emr S.D. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E179-E182Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), appears to be more abundant at early stages of the endocytic pathway (12Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), and lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) is restricted to late endosomes (13Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Immunogold labeling of cryosections shows that LBPA is abundant within the internal membranes of this multivesicular or multilamellar organelle (13Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) and cannot be detected on the cytoplasmic surface of the limiting membrane (14Kobayashi K. Startchev K. Whitney A.J. Gruenberg J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2001; 382: 483-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report that late endosomal membranes can be separated without detergents into distinct populations, each with a unique composition, corresponding to limiting and internal membranes. Our data also suggest that internal membranes can be subfractionated into more than one population, including LBPA-rich membranes, and that LBPA itself exhibits unique pH-dependent fusogenic properties. We conclude that late endosomal internal membranes contain different membrane domains and that their dynamic interplay is regulated by LBPA. 2-(4,4-Difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (β-BODIPY FLC12-HPC) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). DEAE-Sephadex A-25 was from AmershamBiosciences AB. Pre-swollen carboxymethylcellulose CM52 was from Whatman. Monolayers of baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were grown and maintained as described. When necessary to determine the protein composition of late endosome subfractions, cells were metabolically labeled by incubation for 16 h before the experiment with 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine ExpreSS label (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)in low Met/Cys medium (1.5 mg/liter Met, 3.1 mg/liter Cys). To determine the phospholipid (PL) composition of endosomal subfractions, cells were metabolically labeled for 20 h either with 32Pi or with [14C]acetate. The monoclonal antibodies against LBPA (6C4) and Lamp 1(4A1) have been described. 3,3′-LBPA was purified from BHK lipid extracts by preparative TLC after silica gel (Iatrobeads, Sigma, and DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column chromatography); the purified lipid migrated as a single spot on high performance TLC plates and was resistant to phospholipase A2 digestion. 2,2′-LBPA was purified using DEAE Sephadex A-25 and CM52 column chromatography. Fatty acids in LBPA purified from BHK cells were converted to their methyl esters by treatment with 5% HCl in methanol for 1 h in boiling water and were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography using a column of 10% EGSS-X on a Gas Chroma Z (100–120 mesh). Electrospray ionization time of flight/mass spectrometric analysis was performed with Mariner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The samples were dissolved in acetonitrile/methanol (1:1) containing 1% ammonium formate and injected to the instrument. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed in a negative mode with a nozzle potential of −180 eV at a nozzle temperature of 180 °C. Liposomes were prepared in 20 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.3, by sonication; donor liposomes (19 μm) contained 74% DOPC, 21% 2,2′-LBPA, and 5% β-BODIPY FLC12-HPC, and acceptor liposomes (120 μm) contained 67% DOPC and 33% 2,2′-LBPA. In the assay, 50 μl of acceptor liposomes was added to 2.5 ml of Hepes-Na, pH 7.3, and the pH of the solution was adjusted by adding 1 n HCl. Fusion was started by adding 50 μl of donor liposomes and analyzed by fluorometry after excitation at 500 nm. The time course of increased fluorescence emission was measured at 515 nm and recorded. Late endosomal fractions were prepared as described (13Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J.

The post-nuclear supernatant was adjusted to 40.6% sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, loaded at the bottom of an SW60 tube, and overlaid sequentially with 35 and 25% sucrose solutions in 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and then homogenization buffer (HB; 250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4). The gradient was centrifuged for 60 min at 35,000 rpm using an SW60 rotor. Early and late endosomal fractions were collected at the 35/25% and 25%/HB interfaces, respectively (13Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 15Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J.

When the first protocol was used, fractions were first centrifuged for 30 min at 55,000 rpm in a TL55 rotor, and the pellet containing endosomes was resuspended under hypotonic conditions in 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4 (osmotic shock), by 3 passages through a 22-gauge needle fitted onto a 1-ml tuberculin syringe. When the second protocol was used, fractions recovered from the gradient were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then thawed at 37 °C, and this freezing and thawing cycle was repeated 3 times. In both cases, the suspension containing broken endosomes was then centrifuged for 30 min at 55,000 rpm in a TL55 rotor. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of 40% sucrose in 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, loaded into an SW40 tube at the bottom of a linear 8–40% sucrose gradient in the same buffer, and centrifuged at 4 °C in the SW40 rotor for 16 h at 35,000 rpm. Fractions (1 ml each) were collected from the top of the tube. Cells were labeled to equilibrium for 16 h with 32Pi or [14C]acetate and then fractions were prepared as above. Lipids of subcellular or suborganellar fractions were extracted in CHCl3/MeOH and then separated by two-dimensional chromatography (13Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The first direction was run with chloroform, methanol, 32% ammonia (65:35:5, v/v) and the second direction with chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:20:10:12.5:5, v/v). Radioactive lipids were detected by autoradiography and then quantified using the Molecular Imager System (Bio-Rad GS-363). Incorporation of the G-protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) into the plasma membranes and subsequent internalization were as described (17Gruenberg J.E. Howell K.E.

Briefly, virions were bound to the cell surface at 4 °C, and then the viral envelope was fused with the plasma membrane at low pH. Then G molecules were cross-linked on ice with a polyclonal antibody, and cells were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin, to limit G-protein degradation (19Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Cross-linked G molecules are endocytosed and transported to late endosomes and lysosomes for degradation (18Gruenberg J. Howell K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5758-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). At the desired time, cells were processed for immunofluorescence or subcellular fractionation. To analyze the morphology and composition of endosomes, HeLa cells were fixed for 1 h at room temperature in a solution of 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde. The fixative was rinsed three times with PBS, and the cells were processed for cryosectioning essentially as described (20Liou W. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 106: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell pellet was infiltrated with sucrose and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections were cut with a Leica FCS cryotome, transferred to grids, and incubated with an antibody to GFP (A-6455, Molecular Probes) and then with gold-coupled protein A. Alternatively, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the grids were incubated with an antibody to CD63 (M1544 CLB) and then with a gold-coupled goat antibody to mouse immunoglobulin. Grids were examined in a Philips CM10 transmission electron microscope. Lamp1 was immunoprecipitated as described (16Aniento F. Emans N. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1373-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) after dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. Gel electrophoresis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar) and Rhizopus arrhizus lipase treatment (22Paltauf F. Lipids. 1978; 13: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were as described. When indicated, lipid analysis was by high performance TLC using chloroform, methanol, 32% ammonia (65:35:5, v/v) as solvent and lipid staining with copper acetate (23Fewster M. Burns B. Mead J. J. Chromatogr. 1969; 43: 120-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of LBPA purified from BHK cells revealed that oleic acid accounted for >90% of LBPA fatty acyl chains (Table I). This was confirmed by mass spectrometry, because the most abundant ion peak was atm/z 773.54 (theoretical value, 773.53), corresponding to [M − H]− of LBPA containing two oleic acids (Fig. 1). These data show that >90% of the lipid is present as dioleoyl-LBPA in BHK cells. However, the position of the fatty acyl chains is unclear, either the β- (24Wherrett J. Huterer S. Lipids. 1973; 8: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or the α-position (25Luquain C. Dolmazon R. Enderlin J.-M. Laugier C. Lagarde M. Pageaux J.-F. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26Mason R.J. Stossel T.P. Vaughan M. J. Clin. Invest. 1972; 51: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) of the glycerol backbone. Because the β-position is thermodynamically unstable, fatty acids may migrate to the α-position during purification by silica column chromatography (27Chevallier J. Sakai N. Robert F. Kobayashi T. Gruenberg J. Matile S. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 1859-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Indeed, LBPA purified by silica chromatography (13Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) was completely degraded by R. arrhizus lipase (Fig.2A), which is well known to cut preferentially at the α-position. In contrast, an analysis of total lipids extracted from late endosomal fractions, hence without silica column chromatography, showed that LBPA was fully resistant to lipase, whereas PC and PE were almost completely degraded (Fig. 2, Band C). These data strongly suggest that acyl chains are predominantly esterified to the β-position in vivo and that LBPA is thus mostly present in living cells as the 2,2′-dioleoyl isoform (herein referred to as 2,2′-LBPA, Fig. 2D).Table IFatty acid composition of LBPAFatty acid%Palmitic acid (16:0)2.8Palmitoleic acid (16:1)3.4Stearic acid (18:0)1.9Oleic acid (18:1)91.8 Open table in a new tab FIG. 2Structural analysis of LBPA.A, LBPA purified on silica columns was treated with lipase and then analyzed by thin layer chromatography.

The arrow points at a lipid appearing after lipase treatment, presumably lyso-PC. D, structure of 2,2′-dioleoyl-LBPA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) LBPA is a structural isomer of phosphatidylglycerol with an uncommon stereoconfiguration, which presumably accounts for its resistance to phospholipase and degradation (28Brotherus J. Renkonen O. Herrmann J. Fisher W. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1974; 13: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The lipid is related to cardiolipin and is predicted to be cone-shaped. In addition, the presence of free hydroxyl groups at the 3,3′-position (Fig. 2D) may influence its biophysical properties. Indeed, these groups are presumably not buried in the hydrophobic regions of the bilayer but exposed on its outer surface, and thus likely to face the acidic endosomal milieu. We therefore measured the pH-dependent fusion properties of donor liposomes containing 74 mol % dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), 21 mol % 2,2′-LBPA, and 5 mol % β-BODIPY FLC12-HPC, as a fusion tracer, with acceptor liposomes containing 67 mol % DOPC and 33 mol % 2,2′-LBPA. As shown in Fig. 3, these liposomes were highly fusogenic at pH 5.6, a value in the range of late endosomal and lysosomal pH (29Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fusogenicity decreased at pH 6.0 and was essentially abolished at pH 6.5 or 7.3. In contrast, liposomes lacking LBPA did not show pH-dependent fusion activity (not shown). These observations show that 2,2′-LBPA is endowed with unique properties and suggest that the lipid might contribute to the dynamic properties of late endosomal internal membranes. Next, we investigated whether late endosomal lipids could be fractionated into different membrane populations, using a “suborganellar fractionation” protocol. We have shown previously (13Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 15Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1373-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) that late endosomes are easily separated from other endosomal or biosynthetic membranes by floatation in a step sucrose gradient. These purified late endosomal fractions do not contain the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin and are depleted in phosphatidylserine (PS), cholesterol, and sphingomyelin, which are enriched in recycling endosomes (8Gagescu R. Demaurex N. Parton R.G. Hunziker W. Huber L. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2775-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 13Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Purified late endosomes contain a defined subset of phospholipids (PLs) and are highly enriched in LBPA. We showed previously (13Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 30Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.-H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) that LBPA accounts for ≈0.5% of cellular32P-labeled PLs after metabolic labeling with32P for 20 h but ≈14% of late endosomal32P-PLs (see Table II). In order to ensure that these values were not biased by the lipid phosphate group turnover, experiments were repeated after metabolic labeling with [14C]acetate. As shown in Table II, very similar values were obtained when comparing 32P- and14C-labeled lipids.Table IIPhospholipid composition of purified late endosomes32p14CPhosphatidylcholine48.150.6Phosphatidylethanolamine19.712.4Sphingomyelin9.25.6Phosphatidylserine2.45.1Cardiolipin00.1Phosphatidylinositol4.18.6Lysobisphosphatidic acid15.714.8 Open table in a new tab Purified late endosomes were then ruptured under hypotonic conditions by 3 freeze/thaw cycles. Endosome rupture was assessed by measuring the amounts of endocytosed horseradish peroxidase, a content marker, that remained endosome-associated after sedimentation at high speed (latency) (31Robinson L. Gruenberg J. Celis J.E. in Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, London1998: 248-258Google Scholar). After the treatment, latency was reduced to 10% of the untreated control (not shown). This treatment was gentle, because 3 freeze/thaw cycles had hardly any effect on the latency of an early endosomal content marker (not shown). Ruptured late endosomes were then loaded at the bottom of a continuous sucrose gradient (8–40%) and centrifuged to equilibrium for 16 h at 4 °C. After metabolic labeling with 32P, 32P-PLs distributed across the entire gradient (Fig. 4) with three peaks in fractions 4 (d = 1.0655 g/cm3), 7–8 (d = 1.1031 g/cm3), and 12 (d = 1.1654 g/cm3). Intact late endosomal lipids distributed on the gradient as a single peak (d≈1.0772 g/cm3), at the expected density of late endosome (not shown). As a control, early endosome 32P-labeled PLs after the same freeze/thaw cycles distributed as a single peak in fraction 7 (d = 1.1031 g/cm3), at the expected density of early endosomes (see Fig. 6). These experiments show that late endosomal lipids can be subfractionated into different membrane populations.FIG. 6Phospholipid composition of early endosome subfractions. The experiment was carried out exactly as described in Figs. 4 and 5, except that early and not late endosomal fractions were used. Analysis of 32P-phospholipids was by one-dimensional chromatography and autoradiography. PS, phosphatidylserine; SM, sphingomyelin;View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then analyzed the PL composition of each fraction, and we found that the distribution of each PL varied significantly across the gradient (Fig.5A). Phosphatidylcholine (PC) was mostly (≈55%) found in fractions 3–5 at d = 1.0571–1.0772 g/cm3. In these fractions, PC accounted for >70% of the total PLs, while accounting for ≈48% of total32P-PLs in late endosomes (Table II) and other membranes (13Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE, 30%) and phosphatidylinositol (PI, 40%) were recovered predominantly in fraction 7 at d = 1.1031 g/cm3. In this fraction, PE and PI accounted for 42 and 16% of total PLs, while representing roughly 19 and 4% of total late endosomal 32P-PLs, respectively (Table II), again much like in other membranes (13Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Finally, the bulk of LBPA (≈40%) was found in fractions 11 and 12 (d = 1.1545–1.1654 g/cm3), where it was highly enriched, corresponding to ≈60% of total PLs in these fractions, and representing ≈15% of total late endosomal PLs (Table II). Some LBPA was also found in fraction 1, perhaps reflecting LBPA partial association with neutral lipids, in particular cholesterol esters (30Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.-H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This PL distribution did not result from the fragmentation protocol, because it was essentially identical after osmotic rupture of late endosomes (not shown). When using early endosomal fractions as starting materials, no difference in the PL composition of fractions across the peak (fraction 7, d = 1.1031 g/cm3) was detected (Fig.6). This analysis thus indicates that different membrane populations could be separated after late endosome fragmentation (Figs. 4 and5B). Fractions 3 and 4 (d = 1.0571–1.0655 g/cm3) contained mostly PC (>70%), some PE and PS (7–10%), and low (≈5%) levels of other PLs. The peak in fraction 7 (d = 1.1031 g/cm3) exhibited a complex composition and contained all PLs, but mostly PE (42%), PC (23%), and PI (16%). For comparison, Fig. 5B also shows fraction 6 with an intermediate composition between fractions 3 and 7. The composition of the peak in fraction 7 may reflect some contamination with early endosomes, because these are found at the same density. However, although reminiscent of fraction 7, the composition of early endosome fractions is distinct (PC ≈50% and PE ≈20% of total PLs) (13Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Finally, fractions 11 and 12 (d = 1.1545–1.1654 g/cm3) contained primarily LBPA (≈60%), PC (≈20%), some PE (≈10%), and low (<5%) levels of other PLs. We then analyzed the distribution of two late endosomal proteins, Lamp1 and CD63, which colocalize with LBPA in late endosomes (13Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 30Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.-H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In contrast to LBPA, the bulk of Lamp1 is present on the organelle-limiting membrane, even though the protein can occasionally be detected within internal membranes (13Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 16Aniento F. Emans N. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J.

After suborganellar fractionation, small amounts of Lamp1 (≈15%) were found in fraction 12 containing LBPA, perhaps corresponding to some Lamp1 molecules present within LBPA-rich membranes. The bulk of Lamp1, however, peaked in fraction 7 with a complex PL composition (Fig.7A) and did not co-fractionate with LBPA, indicating that Lamp1- and LBPA-containing membranes could be separated after late endosome subfractionation. The tetraspanin CD63 is abundant within internal membranes, in marked contrast to Lamp1, but is also present on the organelle-limiting membrane (33Escola J.M. Kleijmeer M.J. Stoorvogel W.

Consistently, the protein distributes not only to vesicles but also to highly dynamic late endosomal tubules visualized by time-lapse video microscopy, like Lamp1 (35Lebrand C. Corti M. Goodson H.

https://openalex.org/W1980627480,"PI3K/Akt plays a critical role in prostate cancer cell growth and survival. Recent studies have shown that the effect of PI3K/Akt in prostate cells is mediated through androgen signaling. The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, and a tumor suppressor, PTEN, negatively regulate the PI3K/Akt pathway and repress AR activity. However, the molecular mechanisms whereby PI3K/Akt and PTEN regulate the androgen pathway are currently unclear. Here, we demonstrate that blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway reduces the expression of an endogenous AR target gene. Moreover, we show that the repression of AR activity by LY294002 is mediated through phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3β, a downstream substrate of PI3K/Akt, which results in the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. Given the recent evidence that β-catenin acts as a coactivator of AR, our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which PI3K/Akt modulates androgen signaling. In a PTEN-null prostate cancer cell line, we show that PTEN expression reduces β-catenin-mediated augmentation of AR transactivation. Using the mutants of β-catenin, we further demonstrate that the repressive effect of PTEN is mediated by a GSK3β-regulated degradation of β-catenin. Our results delineate a novel link among the PI3K, wnt, and androgen pathways and provide fresh insights into the mechanisms of prostate tumor development and progression."

The PLA1 was identified in the GenBankTM data base as a close homologue of phosphatidylserine (PS)-specific PLA1(PS-PLA1).

These include induction of platelet aggregation, smooth muscle contraction, and stimulation of cell proliferation. LPA also promotes specific responses of the cytoskeleton such as generation of actin stress fibers in fibroblasts or inhibition of neurite outgrowth in neuronal cells. LPA evokes its multiple effects through G-protein-coupled receptors that are specific to LPA (see below), with consequent activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and phospholipase D (PLD), Ca2+ mobilization, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, and transcription of serum-response-element transcriptional reporter genes, such as c-fos.

For example, human serum contains LPA with both saturated (16:0 and 18:0) and unsaturated (16:1, 18:1, 18:2, and 20:4) fatty acids (15Baker D.L. Desiderio D.M. Miller D.D. Tolley B. Tigyi G.J. Anal.

Of particular interest is the detection of 2-linoleoyl-LPA in ascites from ovarian cancer patients, which may account for the increased ability of the ascites to activate the growth of ovarian cancer cell lines (22Xu Y. Gaudette D.C. Boynton J.D. Frankel A. Fang X.J. Sharma A. Hurteau J. Casey G. Goodbody A. Mellors A. Holub B.J. Mills G.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1223-1232PubMed Google Scholar). We recently identified a novel LPA receptor, EDG7/LPA3, which shows a relatively high affinity for 2-acyl-LPA with unsaturated fatty acid (8Bandoh K. Aoki J. Hosono H. Kobayashi S. Kobayashi T.

It is generally accepted that the sn-1 position of glycerophospholipids is occupied by saturated fatty acids, whereas the sn-2 position is occupied by unsaturated fatty acids. This suggests that phospholipase A1 (PLA1) as well as PLA2 are involved in LPA production.PLA1 enzymes hydrolyze the sn-1 fatty acids from phospholipids. Although PLA1 activities are detected in many tissues and cell lines, a limited number of PLA1s have been purified and cloned. We have purified and cloned a cDNA for phosphatidylserine-specific PLA1 (PS-PLA1), a member of the lipase family, from the culture medium of activated rat platelets. PS-PLA1 specifically hydrolyzes PS (24Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and produces 2-acyl-lysophosphatidylserine (LPS), which is a lipid mediator for mast cells (25Hosono H.

Bruni A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and neural cells (27Lourenssen S. Blennerhassett M.G. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 248: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We recently showed that PS-PLA1 stimulates histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells by hydrolyzing PS exposed on the surface of some cell types such as apoptotic cells and activated platelets (25Hosono H. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Bandoh K. Ishida M. Taguchi R. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29664-29670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Accordingly we searched GenBankTM for sequences similar to PS-PLA1 and found one PS-PLA1homologue. Here we demonstrate that the PS-PLA1 homologue is a membrane-associated PA-selective PLA1(mPA-PLA1) that can produce a bioactive lysophospholipid, 2-acyl-LPA, by hydrolyzing PA generated by PLD.DISCUSSIONThe metabolic pathways for LPA synthesis are currently poorly understood, and at least three pathways have been postulated. In the first pathway, LPA is converted from PA by PLA1 or PLA2, which has been observed to occur in erythrocytes and ovarian cancer cells (12Shen Z. Belinson J. Morton R.E., Xu, Y. Xu Y. Gynecol. Oncol. 1998; 71: 364-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13Eder A. Sasagawa T. Mao M. Aoki J. Mills G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 2482-2491PubMed Google Scholar, 33Fourcade O. Simon M.F. Viode C. Rugani N. Leballe F. Ragab A. Fournie B. Sarda L. Chap H. Cell. 1995; 80: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In the second pathway, which may occur in platelets, diacylglycerol produced by PLC, could be deacylated by diacylglycerol lipase, with the resulting monoacylglycerol being further phosphorylated into LPA (34Mauco G. Chap H. Simon M.F. Douste B.L. Biochimie (Paris). 1978; 60: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 35Gaits F. Fourcade O., Le, B.F. Gueguen G. Gaige B. Gassama D.A. Fauvel J. Salles J.P. Mauco G. Simon M.F. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The third pathway involves lysophospholipase D acting on LPC in plasma and may explain the large accumulation of LPA in aged plasma (14Tokumura A. Harada K. Fukuzawa K. Tsukatani H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A similar reaction may occur on the cell surface, in which LPC was converted to LPA by bacterial PLD (36van Dijk M.C. Postma F. Hilkmann H. Jalink K. van Blitterswijk W.J. Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 386-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymes involved in these processes of LPA synthesis have not been characterized fully. However, several PLA2 isoforms identified and characterized biochemically have been implicated in LPA production. For example, studies using inhibitors of PLA2isoforms have suggested that sPLA2-IB, Ca2+-independent PLA2, and cytosolic PLA2 were partially involved in the LPA production of ovarian cancer cells (12Shen Z. Belinson J. Morton R.E., Xu, Y. Xu Y. Gynecol. Oncol. 1998; 71: 364-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13Eder A. Sasagawa T. Mao M. Aoki J. Mills G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 2482-2491PubMed Google Scholar). It was also proposed that sPLA2-IIA was able to produce LPA by hydrolyzing PA exposed on the cell surface after phospholipid scrambling (37le Balle F. Simon M.F. Meijer S. Fourcade O. Chap H. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1999; 39: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or by hydrolyzing PA on membrane microvesicles shed from erythrocytes (33Fourcade O. Simon M.F. Viode C. Rugani N. Leballe F. Ragab A. Fournie B. Sarda L. Chap H. Cell. 1995; 80: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar).The present investigation led to several interesting observations, allowing us to propose a role of a novel PLA1 molecule, mPA-PLA1, in LPA production. Our results from this study are as follows. (i) A low level of LPA that could activate EDG7 was continuously produced and released into the medium in Sf9-mPA-PLA1 cells. (ii) The production of LPA in Sf9-mPA-PLA1 cells was significantly increased after PLD administration (Figs. 6 and 7). (iii) The expression of mPA-PLA1 did not promote accumulation of any lysophospholipids including LPC, LPE, LPI, and LPS in the cells (Fig.4). (iv) We also observed that cPA was equally detected in the media from Sf9-mPA-PLA1, Sf9-WT, and Sf9-mutPLA1 cells only after the PLD treatment (Fig.7). The bacterial PLD (from Actinomadura) used in this study converts lysophospholipids (LPC, LPE, LPS, and LPI) to cPA but not to LPA. 2T. Kobayashi, Ochanomizu University, personal communication. All these results clearly indicate that mPA-PLA1 produces LPA by hydrolyzing PA. We could not detect PLA1 activity of mPA-PLA1 toward exogenously added PA liposome using a conventional assay for PLA1 or A2. It can be speculated that the availability of exogenous substrate to the enzyme is limited, as mPA-PLA1 is tightly associated with membrane phospholipids. mPA-PLA1 may hydrolyze such phospholipids, which surround the enzyme on the plasma membrane, after the phospholipids are converted to PA.PA is a very minor component of phospholipids in mammalian cells and also in Sf9 cells (38Marheineke K. Grunewald S. Christie W. Reilander H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the result that the LPA level was very low under normal conditions (Figs. 5 and 6). It is thus reasonable to assume that the rate-limiting step for LPA production in this pathway is generation of PA. PA could be generated by PLD or sequentially by PLC and diacylglycerol kinase. We observed that exogenously added PLD strongly promoted the production of LPA (Figs. 6 and 7) and that PMA-stimulated production of LPA was suppressed by a PLD inhibitor, 1-butanol (Fig. 5). Thus, it is likely that PLD is involved in the production of LPA mediated by mPA-PLA1. In mammalian cells, the molecular identities of the two isozymes of PLD, PLD1 and PLD2, have been elucidated. Among these two isozymes, PLD1 is activated by PMA both in vivo and in vitrothrough an activation of protein kinase Cα (39Min D.S. Park S.K. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7044-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although information about PLD isozyme(s) in Sf9 insect cells is limited (40Hoer A. Schoneberg T. Harteneck C. Cetindag C. Oberdisse E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), the observation that PMA stimulated LPA formation in Sf9-mPA-PLA1 cells (Fig. 5) suggests an involvement of a PLD1-like molecule in the insect cells. Consistent with this, it is reported by Shen et al. (12Shen Z. Belinson J. Morton R.E., Xu, Y. Xu Y. Gynecol. Oncol. 1998; 71: 364-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) that LPA is produced and secreted from ovarian cancer cells after they were treated with PMA.LPA produced by mPA-PLA1 in Sf9 cells was rich in oleic acid (18:1) and palmitoleic acid (16:1) (Fig. 7). Marheinekeet al. (38Marheineke K. Grunewald S. Christie W. Reilander H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) reported that the major fatty acids in the phospholipids from Sf9 cells were oleic acid, palmitoleic acid, and stearic acid (18:0), with a small amount of palmitic acid (16:0). This explains why LPA with linoleic acid (18:2) and arachidonic acid (20:4), which are the major fatty acids at the sn-2 position of phospholipids of mammalian cells, was not detected. We observed that mPA-PLA1 is abundantly expressed in human platelets that have been characterized well as LPA-producing cells (10Gerrard J.M. Robinson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 11Eichholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In activated platelet, LPA with both saturated (16:0, 18:0) and unsaturated 16:1, 18:1, 18:2, and 20:4 has been detected. This suggests that both PLA1 and PLA2 isozymes are involved in the LPA production in the cells.Although it is possible that EDG7 is activated by an entity other than LPA, this seems unlikely for two reasons. First, the amount of LPA in the conditioned medium of Sf9-mPA-PLA1 cells treated with PLD is ∼5 μm based on the MS analysis (Fig. 7) and 4 μm based on the dose response of EDG7 activation (Fig.3C). Second, the amount of LPA in the conditioned medium of untreated Sf9-mPA-PLA1 cells based on the bioassay is ∼400 nm, a concentration that cannot be detected by MS analysis under the present conditions. These observations support the idea that LPA is the component that activated EDG7.What molecular structures determine the enzymatic activity of PLA1? Guinea pig pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (GPLRP2), which is 63% identical to that of human pancreatic lipase, differs from classical pancreatic lipases in that it displays both lipase and PLA1 activity (41Gassama-Diagne A. Fauvel J. Chap H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 42Hjorth A. Carriereá F. Cudrey C. Woldike H. Boel E. Lawson D.M. Ferrato F. Cambillau C. Dodson G.G. Thim L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4702-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Based on the three-dimensional structures of GPLRP2 and human pancreatic lipase, as well as a modeling of hornet PLA1, two domain structures, the lid domain and the β9 loop, have been suggested to play an essential role in substrate selectivity toward triacylglycerides and phospholipids (43Carriereá F. Withers M.C. van Tilbeurgh H. Roussel A. Cambillau C. Verger R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 417-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The lid domain in lipases, which overlies the active site (44Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), has been suggested to be involved in substrate recognition (45Jennens M.L. Lowe M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25470-25474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One striking feature of molecules belonging to the lipase family which show PLA1 activity is existence of “short” or “mini” lids. In most of the lipases the lids are composed of 22 or 23 amino acids. By contrast, GPLRP2, hornet PLA1, PS-PLA1, and mPA-PLA1 have short lids composed of 5, 7, 12, and 12 amino acids, respectively (Fig.1B). The other domain structure that is capable of determining the substrate specificity of PLA1/lipase is the β9 loop, which is also located in the vicinity of the active site of lipases. The loop is present in human pancreatic lipase and GPLRP2 (showing lipase activity), whereas it is absent in hornet PLA1, PS-PLA1, and mPA-PLA1. Thus, simultaneous deletions of the β9 loop and the lid domain may determine the molecular characteristics of PLA1 in the lipase family. These molecular features may allow us to identify other PLA1 isozymes in the future.mPA-PLA1 and PS-PLA1 form a subfamily within the lipase family (Fig. 1C). PS-PLA1 produces LPS from PS (24Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 46Nagai Y. Aoki J. Sato T. Amano K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29664-29670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that PS-PLA1 also functions as a synthetic enzyme of LPS. It is thus reasonable to assume, from both structural and functional points of view, that these two PLA1s have specialized common function(s) to produce lysophospholipid mediators. Lysophosphatidic acid (1- or 2-acyl-lysophosphatidic acid; LPA)1 is a lipid mediator with multiple biological functions (1Tokumura A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 151-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 2Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol.

These include induction of platelet aggregation, smooth muscle contraction, and stimulation of cell proliferation. LPA also promotes specific responses of the cytoskeleton such as generation of actin stress fibers in fibroblasts or inhibition of neurite outgrowth in neuronal cells. LPA evokes its multiple effects through G-protein-coupled receptors that are specific to LPA (see below), with consequent activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and phospholipase D (PLD), Ca2+ mobilization, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, and transcription of serum-response-element transcriptional reporter genes, such as c-fos. Recent studies (4Chun J. Contos J.J. Munroe D. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 213-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 5Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) have identified a new family of receptor genes for LPA. Members of this family include three G-protein-coupled receptors belonging to the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) family, EDG2/LPA1 (6Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J.

In contrast to the signal transduction mediated by LPA receptors, the molecular mechanisms for LPA production are poorly understood. LPA is produced both in biological fluids such as serum (9Tigyi G.

In these latter studies, it was speculated that LPA is produced by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from phosphatidic acid (PA) that is generated as a result of PLD activation (12Shen Z. Belinson J.

Acta. 1986; 875: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) demonstrated that LPA is also produced in plasma from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) by the action of lysophospholipase D, which may account for the accumulation of LPA in aged plasma. LPA, with various fatty acid species, has been detected in several biological systems. For example, human serum contains LPA with both saturated (16:0 and 18:0) and unsaturated (16:1, 18:1, 18:2, and 20:4) fatty acids (15Baker D.L. Desiderio D.M. Miller D.D. Tolley B. Tigyi G.J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A similar LPA species was detected in human platelets (10Gerrard J.M. Robinson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The activity of LPA has been shown to be modulated by the length, degree of unsaturation, and linkage to the glycerol backbone of the fatty acyl chain (16Sugiura T. Tokumura A. Gregory L. Nouchi T.

https://openalex.org/W2145393821,"Abstract The effectiveness of in vitro primer elongation reactions catalyzed by human bypass DNA polymerases κ (hDinB1), pol η (hRad30A), pol ι (hRad30B), and yeast pol ζ (Rev3 and Rev7) in site-specifically modified template oligonucleotide strands were studied in vitro. The templates contained single bulky lesions derived from the trans-addition of the mutagenic (+)- or (−)-enantiomers ofr7,t8-dihydroxy-t9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (a metabolite of the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene), to the exocyclic amino groups of guanine or adenine in oligonucleotide templates 33, or more, bases long. In “running start” primer extension reactions, pol κ effectively bypassed both the stereoisomeric (+)- and (−)-trans-guanine adducts but not the analogous adenine adducts. In sharp contrast, pol η, which exhibits considerable sequence homology with pol κ (both belong to the group of Y family polymerases), is partially blocked by the guanine adducts and the (−)-trans-adenine adduct, although the stereoisomeric (+)-trans-adenine adduct is more successfully bypassed. Neither pol ι nor pol ζ, either alone or in combination, were effective in trans-lesion synthesis past the same adducts. In all cases, the fidelity of insertion is dependent on adduct stereochemistry and structure. Generally, error-free nucleotide insertion opposite the lesions tends to depend more on adduct stereochemistry than error-prone insertion. None of the polymerases tested are a universal bypass polymerase for the stereoisomeric bulky polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adducts derived from anti-BPDE."
https://openalex.org/W2154288976,"While classically viewed as a prototypic Gs and adenylyl cyclase-coupled G protein-coupled receptor, recent studies have indicated that some aspects of β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) signaling are inhibited by pertussis toxin, indicating that they are mediated by Gi/Go proteins. These signals include activation of ERK MAPKs and Akt activation, as well as hypertrophic and anti-apoptotic pathways in cardiac myocytes. Studies in cultured cells have suggested the hypothesis that protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of the β2-AR regulates its coupling specificity with respect to Gs and Gi. Using a Chinese hamster ovary cell system, we show that mutant β2-ARs with Ala substituted for Ser at consensus PKA sites stimulate robust cyclic AMP accumulation (Gs) but are unable to activate ERK (Gi). In contrast, Ser → Asp mutants are dramatically impaired in their ability to activate adenylyl cyclase but are significantly more active than wild type receptor in activating ERK. Activation of adenylyl cyclase by wild type and Ser → Ala mutant receptors is not altered by pertussis toxin, whereas adenylyl cyclase stimulated through the Ser → Asp mutant is enhanced. Activation of ERK by wild type and Ser → Asp receptors is inhibited by pertussis toxin. To further rigorously test the hypothesis, we utilized a completely reconstituted system of purified recombinant wild type and PKA phosphorylation site mutant β2-ARs and heterotrimeric Gs and Gi. G protein coupling was measured by receptor-mediated stimulation of GTPγS binding to the G protein. PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β2-AR significantly decreased its ability to couple to Gs, while simultaneously dramatically increasing its ability to couple to Gi. These results are reproduced when a purified recombinant Ser → Asp mutant β2-AR is tested, whereas the Ser → Ala receptor resembles the unphosphorylated wild type. These results provide strong experimental support for the idea that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor switches its predominant coupling from Gs to Gi. While classically viewed as a prototypic Gs and adenylyl cyclase-coupled G protein-coupled receptor, recent studies have indicated that some aspects of β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) signaling are inhibited by pertussis toxin, indicating that they are mediated by Gi/Go proteins. These signals include activation of ERK MAPKs and Akt activation, as well as hypertrophic and anti-apoptotic pathways in cardiac myocytes. Studies in cultured cells have suggested the hypothesis that protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of the β2-AR regulates its coupling specificity with respect to Gs and Gi. Using a Chinese hamster ovary cell system, we show that mutant β2-ARs with Ala substituted for Ser at consensus PKA sites stimulate robust cyclic AMP accumulation (Gs) but are unable to activate ERK (Gi). In contrast, Ser → Asp mutants are dramatically impaired in their ability to activate adenylyl cyclase but are significantly more active than wild type receptor in activating ERK. Activation of adenylyl cyclase by wild type and Ser → Ala mutant receptors is not altered by pertussis toxin, whereas adenylyl cyclase stimulated through the Ser → Asp mutant is enhanced. Activation of ERK by wild type and Ser → Asp receptors is inhibited by pertussis toxin. To further rigorously test the hypothesis, we utilized a completely reconstituted system of purified recombinant wild type and PKA phosphorylation site mutant β2-ARs and heterotrimeric Gs and Gi. G protein coupling was measured by receptor-mediated stimulation of GTPγS binding to the G protein. PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β2-AR significantly decreased its ability to couple to Gs, while simultaneously dramatically increasing its ability to couple to Gi. These results are reproduced when a purified recombinant Ser → Asp mutant β2-AR is tested, whereas the Ser → Ala receptor resembles the unphosphorylated wild type. These results provide strong experimental support for the idea that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor switches its predominant coupling from Gs to Gi. β2-adrenergic receptor G protein-coupled receptor extracellular signal-regulated kinase protein kinase A tobacco etch virus pertussis toxin G protein-coupled receptor kinase Chinese hamster ovary mitogen-activated protein kinase phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate The β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR)1 is a well characterized member of a large, diverse family of cell surface receptors referred to as seven membrane-spanning or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). One of the primary ways in which members of this receptor super-family generate signal specificity is by interacting predominantly with one member or a subset of members of the heterotrimeric G protein family. Prior studies of the β2-AR in both reconstituted and cellular systems have shown that it is primarily coupled to Gs and thereby linked to stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity and to important physiological processes such as increased cardiac chronotropy and inotropy and relaxation of vascular and bronchial smooth muscle (1Stiles G.L.

However, certain other aspects of β2-AR signaling appear to be mediated via pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi proteins. These signals include ERK 1/2 activation, receptor tyrosine kinase transactivation, and Akt activation (5Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 6Maudsley S. Pierce K.L. Zamah A.M. Miller W.E. Ahn S. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The important physiological consequences of these signals include both hypertrophic and anti-apoptotic pathways in cultured cardiac myocytes (8Zou Y. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Kudoh S. Uozumi H. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9760-9770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recent cellular studies have suggested that the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi-mediated activation of ERK by β2-ARs is nonetheless dependent on Gs-mediated protein kinase A (PKA) activation, because a chemical inhibitor of PKA (H-89) blocks ERK activation by the β2-AR in HEK 293 cells. Furthermore, because a mutant β2-AR, which cannot be phosphorylated by PKA, is deficient in ERK activation, it has been suggested that the receptor itself must be phosphorylated by PKA to effectively couple to Gi (5Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). However, definitive assessment of this hypothesis cannot be achieved in the complex environment of an intact cell. An increasing number of heptahelical receptors are now known to be capable of coupling to more than one type of heterotrimeric G protein (9Gudermann T. Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 399-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). But almost nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms that might regulate the relative efficacy of coupling of a particular receptor with different G proteins. Accordingly, here we examine, in a completely reconstituted system, the hypothesis that the coupling of β2-ARs to the two G proteins, Gs and Gi, is regulated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor. This work, carried out both with purified recombinant wild type β2-AR, phosphorylated in vitro by PKA, as well as with purified recombinant mutant receptors that mimic the phosphorylated form of the receptors, provides definitive evidence that PKA phosphorylation of the β2-AR can regulate its coupling efficiency to both Gs and Gi. Moreover, these results expand the previously documented role of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β2-AR to desensitize the receptor's ability to couple to Gs, demonstrating that enhanced coupling of the receptor to Gi may be an equally important physiological consequence of this phosphorylation event. All tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen unless otherwise noted. Pertussis toxin was from List Biological Laboratories. ICI-118,551 was from Research Biochemicals International. [35S]GTPγS and 125I-cyanopindolol were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant His6-TEV protease was purchased from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. except where noted. The N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged human wild type and A-4 (S261A/S262A/S345A/S346A) β2-AR were cloned into a modified pBKCMV as previously described (10Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged D-4 (S261D/S262D/S345D/S346D) β2-AR was created by PCR mutagenesis and confirmed by ABI sequencing. For Sf9 expression, the N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged wild type, A-4 and D-4 β2-AR were cloned into pVL1392 (BD PharMingen) with the addition of a His6C-terminal tag to facilitate purification. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown and maintained in Ham's F-12 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and antibiotics (1% penicillin (10 units/ml)/streptomycin (10 mg/ml)) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The DNA used to create the stable cell lines was either the N-terminal FLAG-tagged wild type, A-4 mutant, or D-4 mutant β2-AR in a modified pBKCMV vector. Cells in 10-cm tissue culture plates were transfected using 5 μg of total DNA and a 3:1 ratio of FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were given fresh media every 3 days in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin until single colonies could be isolated. Single colonies were expanded and screened for stable overexpression of the β2-AR using125I-(−)-cyanopindolol binding assays to crude membranes (11Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with bound and free radioligand separated by filtration over 24-mm GF/C glass microfiber filters (Whatman). Stably transfected CHO cells in six-well plates were grown in serum starvation media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, for 16 h prior to agonist stimulation. Where indicated, cells were treated with pertussis toxin (PTX) 100 ng/ml for 16 h prior to agonist stimulation. The cells were stimulated with the appropriate agonist for 5 min at 37 °C, and the reactions were terminated by direct addition of 250 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer to cell monolayers. The cell lysates were sonicated for 10 s, boiled for 10 min, and clarified by brief centrifugation at 20,000 × g. The samples were then electrophoresed on 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Phospho-ERK was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho p44/42 ERK-specific antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Duplicate gels were used to blot for total ERK expression in the lysate using a rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK 1/2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, 1:2000). The blots were washed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0/150 mm NaCl/0.05% v/v Tween 20/0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (TBS-T) and incubated with a 1:7000 dilution of secondary donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were visualized by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitation of the images was performed using a Fluor-S Multiimager with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Attached cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and lysed by Dounce homogenization. Unlysed cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. Pelleted membranes were washed twice and resuspended in 75 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA buffer. Adenylyl cyclase activities were determined as previously described (12Bouvier M. Hnatowich M. Collins S. Kobilka B.K. Deblasi A. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 133-139PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition of membranes to the assay mixtures and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Determinations were performed in triplicate. Cells were grown to ∼80% confluence in six-well dishes in media containing 0.25 mg/ml Geneticin, and where indicated PTX (100 ng/ml) was added 16 h prior to agonist stimulation. The cells were rinsed once in serum-free media and then treated with 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) for 5 min prior to stimulation to inhibit phosphodiesterases. Cells were stimulated for 10 min at 37 °C with the indicated concentration of (−)-isoproterenol in the presence of 1 mm IBMX and 0.4 mm ascorbate. Forskolin (10 μm) was used as a positive control. To terminate stimulation, the media was aspirated and 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4/4 mm EDTA) was added to each well, and the samples were placed on ice. The cells were detached by scraping, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The samples were boiled for 10 min, centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 ×g, and frozen overnight at −100 °C for subsequent determination of cAMP levels. The levels of cAMP were determined using a 3H-labeled cAMP assay system (AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The final results were expressed as picomoles of cAMP/mg of protein. The human β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) was expressed and purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described previously (13Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The wild type and PKA point mutant receptors all contain an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag and a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag to facilitate purification. Briefly, Sf9 cells were harvested by centrifugation 48 h post-infection with the recombinant virus. The cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization, and a membrane fraction was prepared by centrifugation at 33,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The membranes were solubilized with 0.25% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside and purified by sequential chromatography using an alprenolol-Sepharose column (14Benovic J.L. Shorr R.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4510-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) with a procedure originally modified from a prior protocol (15Caron M.G. Srinivasan Y. Pitha J. Kociolek K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2923-2927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a subsequent nickel affinity column (13Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and a final anion exchange Q-Sepharose column. The purified receptor was assayed for its ability to bind125I-cyanopindolol and reconstituted into crude soybean phosphatidylcholine (20%) lipid vesicles using a modified protocol (16Cerione R.A. Strulovici B. Benovic J.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Nature. 1983; 306: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, the receptor and phospholipid were incubated with the detergent n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (0.95%, w/v) in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2 on ice and subsequently eluted over a detergent-removing Extracti-gel column (Pierce). The eluate was then treated with polyethylene glycol 8000 to promote fusion of the nascent vesicles, followed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The pelleted vesicles were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4/100 mm NaCl and assayed for 125I-cyanopindolol binding to determine efficiency of reconstitution and to enable equivalent amounts of receptor to be used in the subsequent experiments. Control vesicles were made by the same method but excluding any receptor in the initial incubation period. The H6TEVpQE-60 plasmids containing either Gαs or Gαi-1 were the generous gifts of A. Gilman (University of Texas Southwestern). The recombinant Gα subunits were grown inEscherichia coli and purified as previously described (17Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The Gβγ subunits were provided by D. Capel and were purified from bovine brain, as previously described (18Casey P.J. Graziano M.P. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Stoichiometric amounts of Gα and Gβγ subunits were mixed and placed on ice. Vesicles containing the reconstituted β2-AR protein were added to the heterotrimeric G protein mixture on ice and incubated for 15–30 min. The [35S]GTPγS binding buffer consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm ascorbate. A solution of 1 nm [35S]GTPγS was made using the binding buffer (19Cerione R.A. Codina J. Benovic J.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Birnbaumer L. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4519-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Typical specific activity of the radiolabeled [35S]GTPγS mixture was 6,000–12,000 cpm/pmol. Each binding reaction was performed in a 12- × 75-mm polypropylene tube (Fisher) and consisted of 50 μl of the [35S]GTPγS and 8 μl of reconstituted receptor/G protein mixtures in the presence or absence of 10 μm (−)-isoproterenol. Each reaction was done in duplicate at 25 °C for the indicated time and quenched by the addition of 5 ml of ice-cold quench buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mmMgCl2, and 1 μm GTP). The reactions were then filtered using 0.45-μm BA-85 nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell), as described previously (20Fields T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23119-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11416-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The filters were washed six times with 5 ml of quench buffer, placed in Lefkofluor scintillation fluid, and counted in a Tri-Carb scintillation counter (Packard). Background counts were determined from reactions lacking G protein in the binding mixture. Control binding was determined by performing the reaction with the heterotrimeric G protein with phospholipid vesicles lacking the receptor to determine the baseline level of G protein loading. The data were plotted using Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.) and fit to a single-site hyperbolic binding curve. Purified recombinant β2-AR was reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles as described above. A typical reaction used 3–5 pmol of receptor in a final volume of 40 μl. The phosphorylation buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 60 μm[γ-32P]ATP (∼5000 cpm/pmol). For each reaction with PKA, 0.5 μg of catalytic PKA subunit (Promega) was included. For GRK2 reactions, 0.4 μg of purified recombinant GRK2 was used, and the phosphorylation buffer was supplemented with 10 μmisoproterenol and 0.1 mm ascorbate (22Pitcher J. Lohse M.J. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3193-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 45 min and terminated by the addition of 400 μl of ice-cold 100 mm NaCl/10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. For experiments involving G protein loading using phosphorylated β2-AR, the PKA phosphorylation reaction was terminated by the addition of a peptide inhibitor of PKA (22Pitcher J. Lohse M.J. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3193-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and the β2-AR was then reconstituted with heterotrimeric G proteins and used in the [35S]GTPγS binding assay. For quantitation of 32P-phosphorylated receptor, the phospholipid vesicles were reclaimed by centrifugation at 350,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The pellet was gently washed once in 100 mm NaCl/10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 25 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The entire volume was electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels, which were then dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and quantitated using a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). We had originally identified Serines 261, 262, 345, and 346 of the β2-AR as putative PKA phosphorylation sites, because they occur in classic consensus PKA phosphorylation site motifs RRSS on the intracellular portions of the receptor (10Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on previously published data, we expected that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β2-AR would attenuate this receptor's ability to activate adenylyl cyclase, because this is classically a Gs-mediated pathway for the β2-AR (22Pitcher J. Lohse M.J. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3193-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expected that a β2-AR mutant that mimics a constitutively dephosphorylated receptor (four Ser to Ala mutations, or A-4) would exhibit robust agonist-induced signaling to adenylyl cyclase, similar to the wild type receptor. Conversely, a receptor that mimics the PKA-phosphorylated β2-AR (four Ser to Asp mutations, or D-4) would be expected to be impaired in its ability to activate adenylyl cyclase. To evaluate this hypothesis, we created stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) fibroblast lines expressing either the wild type, D-4, or A-4 β2-AR. Individual cell lines with comparable receptor expression levels (roughly 250 fmol/mg as assayed by 125I-cyanopindolol binding) were used, which was significantly greater than endogenous β-receptor expression (5–10 fmol/mg). We initially measured the ability of isoproterenol to stimulate adenylate cyclase in membranes prepared from each of these cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1, the wild type β2-AR produces robust cAMP accumulation. The A-4 β2-AR maximally stimulated adenylate cyclase activity to a slightly greater (∼20%) extent than wild type receptor, and its dose-response curve was shifted slightly (∼3-fold) to the left. In contrast, the D-4 β2-AR barely stimulated enzyme activity above basal levels. The level of cAMP production by endogenous β-receptors in CHO cells under these conditions was insignificant compared with that obtained from β2-AR overexpression. To assess what effect, if any, β2AR coupling to Gi would have on cAMP accumulation, we performed dose-response experiments in intact CHO cells expressing the wild type and each of the mutant receptors in the presence and absence of pre-treatment with pertussis toxin (PTX). As shown in Fig.2, PTX had no effect on wild type and A-4 β2-AR-stimulated cAMP production. In contrast, D-4 β2-AR mediated cAMP production was significantly increased by PTX pre-treatment, and this effect became more pronounced at higher agonist concentrations (∼50% increase in cAMP production). However, even in the presence of PTX, cAMP production by the D-4 β2-AR only reached 36% of the level produced by wild type β2-AR stimulation. These results suggest that the D-4 mutant may be impaired in cAMP production for two distinct reasons. First, there is a decrease in its ability to activate Gs, and second, there is an increase in its ability to activate Gi, as compared with the wild type receptor. In the whole cell cAMP assays, which were performed in the presence of the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX, the D-4 mutant was about 25% as active as the wild type β2-AR. Forskolin-mediated cAMP production was not significantly different between the various cell lines (data not shown). Because the β2-ARs containing mutations at consensus PKA phosphorylation sites had differing abilities to induce cAMP accumulation in CHO cells, we next examined the ability of isoproterenol to activate the ERK MAPK pathway (a known PTX-sensitive signal) in these different receptor cell lines. As shown in Fig.3A, stimulation of CHO cells expressing the wild type β2-AR with 1 μmisoproterenol for 5 min induced significant ERK 1/2 phosphorylation. As reported previously for other cell lines (5Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 23Pierce K.L. Maudsley S. Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), β2-AR-mediated ERK activation was inhibited by pre-treatment with PTX in CHO cells (decreased by 75%). As shown in Fig. 3A, the D-4 β2-AR-expressing cell line had a significantly greater ability to activate ERK 1/2, compared with the wild type β2-AR, in response to agonist (∼2.5-fold enhancement), and this signal is also PTX-sensitive. The PTX-insensitive component of the ERK 1/2 signal is likely due to the additional influence of Gs activation and/or cAMP generation on pathways leading to ERK 1/2 activation (24Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 25de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L.

Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). A cell line expressing the A-4 β2-AR at comparable levels did not significantly activate ERK in response to isoproterenol stimulation. There was no significant difference in the ability of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (1 μm) to activate ERK between the cell lines, and this signal was not affected by pre-treatment with PTX, demonstrating that ERK pathways are intact in all the cell lines. Quantitation of these data is shown in Fig.3B. Total ERK protein levels were comparable among the cell lines (data not shown). To determine the G protein coupling specificity of the wild type and PKA mutant receptors, we expressed and purified recombinant receptors from Sf9 cells. We also purified recombinant Gαs and Gαi-1 from E. coli and endogenous Gβγ subunits from bovine brain. We then reconstituted the purified receptors with either purified heterotrimeric Gs or Gi in phospholipid vesicles. The ability of the receptor to interact with the G protein was assayed by [35S]GTPγS binding to the Gα subunit in the presence, or absence, of isoproterenol. Basal levels of activation due to spontaneous G protein nucleotide turnover were determined for each experiment (in the absence of receptor) and subtracted from all subsequent calculations. This system allows for the direct determination of relative coupling efficiencies between receptors and different G proteins. Fig.4 shows that agonist stimulation of both the wild type and A-4 β2-ARs results in robust activation of Gs over a 15-min time course. In contrast, agonist stimulation of the D-4 β2-AR reveals significant impairment in its ability to couple to Gs. The D-4 mutant is roughly 75% impaired in inducing Gs activation at the 15-min time point, compared with the wild type β2-AR. This correlates well with the decreased cAMP production stimulated by this receptor in CHO cells, as we would expect, because adenylyl cyclase activation is Gs-mediated. Because the D-4 β2-AR is better able to activate the PTX-sensitive ERK MAPK pathway in CHO cells, we reasoned that the D-4 mutant would be better able to couple to PTX-sensitive G proteins. To evaluate this, we reconstituted the purified D-4 mutant and wild type β2-ARs with heterotrimeric Gi-1 protein in phospholipid vesicles and assayed the agonist-promoted [35S]GTPγS binding to the Gα subunit. Fig.5 shows that the wild type β2-AR has a small, but significant, level of agonist-mediated Gi coupling. However, the D-4 β2-AR has significantly increased coupling to Gi even in the absence of agonist, as compared with the wild type β2-AR. This high level of basal coupling was further increased by isoproterenol stimulation (up to 6-fold the wild type signal) and was modestly decreased by administration of the inverse agonist ICI-118,551, suggesting receptor-regulated responses. Because the PKA phosphorylation site mutant β2-ARs (serines 261, 262, 345, and 346 mutated) have different signaling characteristics from the wild type β2-AR when expressed in CHO cells, we next wanted to confirm that these mutants represented the characteristics of either an endogenously PKA-phosphorylated receptor or a constitutively dephosphorylated receptor. To confirm that we had correctly identified the relevant PKA sites within the β2-AR, we overexpressed and purified the wild type, D-4, and A-4 β2-ARs from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. The receptors were purified to similar specific activities (∼17,000 pmol/mg) and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles for in vitro characterization. The in vitro phosphorylation assays depicted in Fig.6 show that the wild type β2-AR is phosphorylated by both PKA and GRK2 to similar stoichiometries of 2.3 and 2.6 mol of Pi/mol of receptor, respectively"

The hen-1 mutants show defects in the integration of two sensory signals and in behavioral plasticity by paired stimuli, although their sensation capability seems to be identical to that of the wild-type. The HEN-1 protein is expressed in two pairs of neurons, but expression in other neurons is sufficient for wild-type behavior. In addition, expression of HEN-1 at the adult stage is sufficient. Thus, HEN-1 regulates sensory processing non-cell-autonomously in the mature neuronal circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2039168627,"Cox11 is a protein essential for respiratory growth and has been implicated in the assembly of the CuB site of cytochrome c oxidase. In the present study, we demonstrate that Cox11 is a copper-binding protein. The soluble C-terminal domain of Cox11 forms a dimer that coordinates one Cu(I) per monomer via three thiolate ligands. The two Cu(I) ions in the dimer exist in a binuclear cluster and appear to be ligated by three conserved Cys residues. Mutation of any of these Cys residues reduces Cu(I) binding and confers respiratory incompetence. Cytochromec oxidase activity is reduced in these mutants. Thus, the residues important for Cu(I) binding correlate with in vivo function, suggesting that Cu(I) binding is important in Cox11 function.

Multiple subunits and several cofactors are necessary for catalytic activity, including two hemes a, a magnesium ion, a zinc ion, and three copper ions. Insertion of these cofactors and assembly of the CcO complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane, in some cases many Å units below the membrane surface, requires accessory proteins (for a general review, see Ref. 1Nittis T. McCall K. Winge D.R. Winkelmann G. Microbial Transport Systems. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim2001: 419-445Crossref Google Scholar). It has recently become clear that the required metal ions cannot simply diffuse to the requisite compartment for insertion into the desired protein. In fact, a complex machinery of metal importers and chaperones has been discovered (2O'Halloran R.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The metallochaperone responsible for the delivery of copper to the mitochondrion is Cox17 (3Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Once there, it is postulated that Cox17 transfers copper to Sco1, the protein responsible for copper insertion into the binuclear CuA site in Cox2 (4Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 5Paret C. Ostermann K. Krause-Buchholz U. Rentzsch A. Rodel G.

Genet. 1999; 35: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Cox11 plays a role in the delivery of copper to the CuB site in Cox1 (7Hiser L., Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Little is known about the mechanics of either process. Saccharomyces cerevisiae COX11 is a nuclear gene that encodes a membrane-bound mitochondrial protein. Cox11 was first implicated in the CcO maturation process by Tzagoloff et al.(8Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), who noted that Δcox11 yeast lacked CcO activity and were deficient in heme a. This led to the hypothesis that Cox11 and another protein, Cox10, played a role in heme abiosynthesis (9Tzagoloff A. Nobrega M. Gorman N. Sinclair P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar). It is now apparent that Cox10 and Cox15 are the two key enzymes involved in heme a formation (9Tzagoloff A. Nobrega M. Gorman N. Sinclair P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mogi T. Saiki K. Anraku Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11Barros M.H. Carlson C.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the CuB site is absent in CcO purified from Rhodobacter sphaeroides lacking COX11 (7Hiser L., Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Tzagoloff et al. (8Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have shown that cox11 mutants lack CcO activity; however, RNA and protein synthesis of the core subunits 1, 2, and 3 are normal, suggesting that Cox11 functions post-translationally to generate active CcO (8Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that Cox11 functions primarily in CuB site formation, possibly delivering copper directly to the site. Alternatively, Cox11 could act as a co-chaperone, facilitating Cu(I) donation by another molecule. The working model for metallation of the CuA site is that Cox17 donates Cu(I) to Sco1, which inserts copper into the Cox2 CuA site. Cox11 may function in an analogous fashion but with specificity for the CuB site. It is predicted that Cox11 is a metallochaperone, presumably binding copper, and the residues that bind the copper ion will be important for in vivo function. In this study, we demonstrate that a soluble truncate of Cox11 is a copper protein, binding approximately one copper per polypeptide. Functional analysis of conserved amino acid residues showed that the copper atom was bound by cysteine residues and that loss of copper binding correlated with loss-of-function in vivo. These studies support the postulate that Cox11 is a metallochaperone for formation of the CuB site of CcO. The COX11 gene lacking the first 300 base pairs (bp) was amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA by PCR. BamHI and SalI were added to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Unfavorable arginine, isoleucine, and leucine codons in the first 10 codons were corrected by replacement in the PCR primer for expression in Escherichia coli. The 609-bp fragment was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced. TheBamHI/SalI fragment was subcloned into pET32a (Novagen), creating pHCDW4 for expression of a thioredoxin-Cox11 (TrxCox11) fusion protein. The entire COX11 gene, including 772-bp upstream and 100-bp downstream flanked by BamHI and HindIII sites, respectively, was amplified from yeast genomic DNA, cloned into pGEM-T, and sequenced. The 1.8-kbBamHI/HindIII fragment was subcloned into YEp351 to yield the high copy yeast expression vector, pHCDW3. Mutagenesis ofCOX11 was carried out using the QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis kit on both pHCDW3 and pHCDW4. The resulting plasmids were sequenced and the BamHI/SalI and BamHI/HindIII fragments subcloned to ensure there were no undesirable mutations elsewhere in the vector. S. cerevisiae strain BY4741Δcox11 (mat a, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0) and its isogenic parent strain were purchased from Research Genetics. Cells were grown in YPD or synthetic medium lacking leucine that was supplemented with 2% glucose or 3% glycerol as the carbon source. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) harboring pHCDW4 was grown in LB-ampicillin to an OD600 of 0.6–0.9 before induction with 0.3 mm IPTG for 4 h at 30 °C. If desired, CuSO4 was added to a final concentration of 1.4 mm after 30 min of induction. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 0.25 msucrose, and frozen at −70 °C. The cells were thawed, resuspended in lysis buffer (2× PBS with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 5 mm imidazole), and lysed by repeated sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 5 °C for 40 min. If copper was not added during growth, 450 μmCuSO4 and 4.5 mm glutathione were added to the clarified lysate with gentle stirring at 4 °C for 60 min. The supernatant was then loaded onto a Ni-NTA (Qiagen) column equilibrated with lysis buffer. After loading, the column was washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer, and protein was eluted with 250 mmimidazole in lysis buffer. Fractions containing Cox11 were filtered and loaded onto a Sephacryl S300 size exclusion column and eluted with PBS, 1 mm DTT. For generation of selenomethionine-labeled Cox11, E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pHCDW4 were grown in M9 minimal medium to an OD600 of 0.6. Endogenous methionine biosynthesis was inhibited as previously described (12Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar), and the medium was supplemented with 60 mg/liter selenomethionine (Anatrace Inc.) After 15 min, IPTG was added to induce protein expression. Induction time was extended to 8 h, as protein synthesis was retarded by growth in limiting medium. All subsequent purification steps were similar, except buffers were supplemented with 5 mmmethionine to prevent selenomethionine oxidation. Protein was quantified by amino acid analysis after hydrolysis in 5.7 m HCl containing 0.1% phenolin vacuo at 110 °C. The analysis was performed on a Beckman 6300 analyzer. Copper content of the protein was measured using a PerkinElmer AAnalyst 100 atomic absorption spectrometer. Analytical gel filtration was performed on a Superdex G200 sizing column in PBS containing 1 mm DTT. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge with an AnTi60 rotor at 20 °C, using either 6-channel (12-mm thick) or double sector (3-mm thick), charcoal-epon centerpieces. Samples were dialyzed against three changes of PBS to remove DTT. Sample channels contained multiple loading concentrations of protein in PBS whereas reference channels contained the dialysate. Loading concentrations varied between 3 and 35 μm in order to produce absorbance scans within the linear range of the detector at 280 nm. Samples were centrifuged until sedimentation and chemical equilibrium were attained. Cells were scanned radially in continuous mode, with data resulting from 10 absorbance readings taken at 0.001-cm intervals. Equilibrium was confirmed by no change in scans taken at 4-h intervals. The value used for the partial specific volume, 0.731 ml/mg, was calculated from the amino acid sequence using the method of Ref. 13Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Horton J.C. Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Cambridge, 1992: 90-125Google Scholar. Various models describing the concentration distribution were fit to final absorbance versus radius data using non-linear least squares techniques and the analysis program NONLIN (14Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Ypahantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). NONLIN performs simultaneous non-linear least squares fits to one or more sets of ultracentrifuge data. This program can be used to determine molecular weights, association constants, and virial coefficients. In each case, the final fit resulted from the simultaneous fitting of up to four different concentration distributions. To avoid the problem of relative local minima in the variance space, the fitting procedure was begun at many different initial points spanning the range of the parameters. Measurements were carried out at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory with the SPEAR storage ring containing 60–100 mA at 3.0 GeV, on beamlines 9-3 and 7-3 operating with a wiggler field of 2 and 1.8 Tesla, respectively, and using a Si(220) double crystal monochromator. Beamline 9-3 is equipped with a rhodium-coated collimating mirror upstream of the monochromator, and a bent-cylindrical Rh-coated focusing mirror downstream of the monochromator. Harmonic rejection on 9-3 was accomplished by setting the cutoff energy of the focusing mirror to 11 keV, whereas on 7-3 harmonic rejection was achieved by detuning one monchromator crystal to ∼50% of the peak value. The incident x-ray intensity was monitored using nitrogen-filled ionization chambers, and x-ray absorption was measured as the x-ray Kα fluorescence excitation spectrum using an array of thirty germanium intrinsic detectors (15Cramer S.P. Tench O. Yocum M. George G.N. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res., Sect. A. 1988; 266: 586-591Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar). During data collection, samples were maintained at a temperature of ∼10 K using a liquid helium flow cryostat. For each sample, between four and eight 35-min scans were accumulated, and the absorption of a standard copper metal foil was measured simultaneously by transmittance. The energy was calibrated with reference to the lowest energy inflection point of the copper foil, which was assumed to be 8980.3 eV. The extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) oscillations χ (k) were quantitatively analyzed by curve-fitting using the EXAFSPAK suite of computer programs (ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/exafspak.html). Ab-initio theoretical phase and amplitude functions were calculated with the program FEFF (version 8.2) (16Rehr J.J. Albers R.C. Zabinsky S.I. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1992; 69: 3397-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from S. cerevisiae as described previously (17Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay, and cytochrome c oxidase activities were measured as previously described (18Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Chicken antibodies were raised against recombinant Cox11 by Aves Laboratories, Inc. For Western analyses, proteins were separated on 12.5% acrylamide gels in Laemmli buffer and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with antibodies against Cox11 (1:5000) or porin (1:15,000). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken IgG was the secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized with ECL reagents (AmershamBiosciences, Inc. or Pierce) or 4-chloro-1-naphthol. Cox11 is believed to facilitate copper incorporation into the CuB site of cytochrome c oxidase. One possible model for this function is for Cox11 to receive copper from Cox17 and insert it into Cox1. Consistent with its postulated role, Cox11 is localized to the mitochondrial membrane (8Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); the C terminus, which contains several conserved cysteines, methionines, and histidines capable of ligating copper, is believed to project into the intermembrane space. To determine whether Cox11 binds copper, a soluble truncate lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence and putative transmembrane helix was constructed. A hexahistidine-tagged version of truncated Cox11 expressed well but was insoluble under all conditions investigated (data not shown). To generate soluble protein, the 609-bp fragment encoding the truncate was inserted into the pET32a vector, generating a thioredoxin-tagged Cox11 fusion protein (Fig.1). Purified and soluble TrxCox11 appears light brown when concentrated and is stable at 4 °C in dilute solution. Atomic absorption spectroscopy showed that purified TrxCox11 bound ∼1 copper atom per monomer of protein (Table I). The ultraviolet absorption spectrum exhibits a fairly broad absorption between 265 and 285 nm, consistent with the overlap of the aromatic protein residues and S-Cu charge transfer bands centered around 260 nm (19Winge D.R. Dameron C.T. George G.N. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1994; 10: 1-48PubMed Google Scholar). TrxCox11 exhibits only very weak luminescence when excited at 300 nm, suggesting that the copper ion is not bound in a multicopper cluster in a solvent-shielded environment (data not shown).Table ICopper content of TrxCox11 variantsProteinCu/proteinnWT1.23 ± 0.174C111A0.44 ± 0.052M224L0.46 ± 0.172M240L1.11 ± 0.282C208A/C210A0.31 ± 0.132C111A/C208A/C210A0.22 ± 0.042Dimer1.02 ± 0.103 Open table in a new tab Several other mitochondrial copper proteins, including CcO, exist as dimers or oligomers. To determine whether TrxCox11 was monomeric, purified protein was subjected to gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2). TrxCox11 eluted primarily as a dimer, with a small fraction of protein consistently appearing as higher order aggregates. Concentration of the dimeric fractions and re-analysis by analytical gel filtration did not cause a change in the oligomeric state, suggesting that the higher order oligomers were nonspecific aggregates. Oligomerization was not dependent on copper, as purified apo-Cox11 also eluted at the molecular weight predicted for a dimer (data not shown). Furthermore, removal of the thioredoxin tag did not alter the aggregation state of TrxCox11. Incubation with thrombin to cleave the tag, followed by gel filtration analysis, generated a chromatogram consistent with the presence of monomeric thioredoxin and dimeric Cox11. When expressed as a control, thioredoxin migrated as a monomer on a sizing column and bound only 0.1 mol of copper per mol of protein (n = 1, data not shown). A more quantitative analysis of the solution state of TrxCox11 was obtained by sedimentation equilibrium. The final fit used four data files of various concentrations. TrxCox11 was best described by a single species model returning a molecular mass of 80.6 ± 18 kDa, consistent with the calculated dimer molecular mass of 80.4 kDa. The data were well described by this model as is evident by the randomly distributed residuals shown in Fig. 3. At the concentrations employed, the dimer was the sole species of TrxCox11 observed. X-ray absorption spectroscopy was performed to probe the coordination environment of the copper site of Cox11. The Cu-K absorption near-edge shows features characteristic of trigonal cuprous thiolate species (Fig. 4A). In particular, the intensity of the 8983 eV 1s → 4p feature is diagnostic of the coordination environment (20Kau L.-S. Spira-Solomon D.J. Penner-Hahn J.E. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 6433-6442Crossref Scopus (965) Google Scholar) and is very similar to that of CuCox17 and the trigonal [Cu4(SPh)6]2−Cu(I)-thiolate complex (Fig. 4B). The edge of TrxCox11 dimer is essentially identical to the absorption edge obtained when all TrxCox11 aggregation states are pooled and analyzed. Moreover, removal of the thioredoxin tag by incubation with thrombin followed by gel-filtration chromatography caused no observable change in the copper site, as monitored by XAS (Fig. 4A). The Cu-K-edge EXAFS spectra and their Fourier transforms (FT) of Cox11 are shown in Fig. 5, A and B, respectively. The EXAFS data for all preparations were very similar (Fig. 5). The transform shows two major peaks. The more intense peak (at about 2.25 Å) is attributable to Cu-S backscattering, whereas the other peak (at about 2.7 Å) is attributable to outer shell Cu-Cu backscattering. Curve-fitting analysis of the EXAFS spectra indicate three Cu-S ligands at 2.25 Å and one Cu-Cu at 2.71 Å (Table II). Attempts to fit the data using ligands other than sulfur yielded poor quality fits with physically unreasonable Debye-Waller factors.Table IIXAS dataSampleCu-SCu-CuΔEo(eV)FNR (Å)ς2(Å2)NR (Å)ς2 (Å2)TrxCox1132.251 (1)0.0058 (1)12.710 (2)0.0046 (2)−19.2 (8)0.251Cox1132.245 (1)0.0047 (1)12.706 (2)0.0041 (2)−19.2 (8)0.190SeMet Cox1132.247 (1)0.0048 (1)12.702 (2)0.0044 (2)−19.2 (8)0.169 Open table in a new tab The full sequence of yeast Cox11 contains five cysteines. Two of these cysteines are within the candidate mitochondrial targeting sequence and are not likely to be part of the mature protein. Thus, three cysteines and two methionines that are conserved between S. cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Homo sapiens remain as possible copper ligands. Functional analysis of the conserved cysteine and methionine residues was probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations were made in pHCDW3, and this high copy yeast expression vector was transformed into a Δcox11strain. Transformants were tested for complementation of the inability of the Δcox11 strain to grow on the non-fermentable carbon source, glycerol. Cys-111, Cys-208, and Cys-210 were necessary for growth on glycerol as alanine substitutions at these positions failed to restore growth on glycerol medium (Fig.6). Mitochondria isolated from the C111A, C208A, C210A, and C208A/C210A Cox11 mutant strains were isolated and found to lack CcO activity. Western analysis (Fig.7) demonstrated that the failure of the Cys → Ala variants to complement the null phenotype was not caused by a lack of protein expression. Neither Met-224 nor Met-240 is necessary for respiration (Fig. 6).FIG. 7Western analysis of Cox11 mutant proteins. Mitochondria were isolated from Δcox11cells harboring high copy expression plasmids bearing a wild type or variant COX11 allele. 20 μg of protein was run on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose for development. Cox11 and porin were visualized with specific antibodies. Porin is the loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pHCDW4 to determine which of the conserved cysteines and methionines in Cox11 participate in Cu(I) coordination. Because XAS data suggested that the Cu(I) ligands were sulfurs, nitrogen-donating histidines were ignored. The cysteines, including two that are located in a highly conserved Cys-Xaa-Cys motif, were mutated to alanines, whereas the conserved methionines were converted into leucines. For purification, the single mutations (C111A, M224L, and M240L), the double (C208A/C210A), and the triple (C111A/C208A/C210A) variants were generated. Substoichiometric amounts of copper were bound by the C111A mutant, the C208A/C210A variant, the C111A/C208A/C210A mutant, and the M224L variant (Table I). The mutants behaved similarly during purification and eluted as dimers on the gel filtration column, suggesting that the mutations did not cause significant conformational changes. To determine whether Met-224 was present in the inner coordination sphere of the copper ion, Cox11 was labeled with selenomethionine and XAS data were collected. Analysis of the Se-K-edge XAS was not possible because the high methionine content of the protein masked the contribution from Met-224, but the Cu-K-edge XAS showed no significant differences with the wild type, with no indications of Cu-Se backscattering. This result indicates that Met-224 is not coordinated to copper in Cox11. It has been proposed that Cox11 participates in the assembly of the CuB center of CcO (7Hiser L., Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For this function, it is likely that Cox11 interacts with Cox17 to receive copper imported from the cytosol and inserts the copper ion into Cox1. In this study we show that, consistent with this role, Cox11 binds one Cu(I) ion per monomer. The soluble, truncated form of Cox11 bound copper tightly, as the metal was not lost during purification or dialysis in buffers containing β-mercaptoethanol and DTT. XAS shows that the Cu(I) ion is ligated by three sulfurs. These spectroscopic data suggested that methionines or cysteines, particularly two in a highly conserved Cys-Xaa-Cys motif, were probable Cu(I) ligands. Mutation of conserved cysteine residues (Cys-111, Cys-208, Cys-210) led to a significant loss of copper from the purified truncate. Mutation of one conserved methionine (Met-224) also led to a decrease in the copper-to-protein stoichiometry; however, subsequent spectroscopic analysis of selenomethionyl Cox11 showed no Se-Cu backscattering, suggesting that the copper ligands are three conserved cysteine residues. In vivo, the full-length mutated COX11 gene coding for each of the three conserved Cys → Ala substitution was unable to complement the growth phenotype of Δcox11strains on glycerol. The Met → Leu variants showed wild type growth for both Met-224, which showed a decrease in copper binding when purified as a truncate, and Met-240, which bound stoichiometric amounts of copper. Hiser et al. (7Hiser L., Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) noted that substoichiometric amounts of R. sphaeroides Cox11 allowed normal CcO activity and spectroscopic characteristics. If M224L causes only a partial loss-of-function, one would not expect to see its effects in vivo. Thus, it is possible that Met-224 plays a role in copper transfer or stabilization of the copper site without binding in the inner coordination sphere. The soluble truncate of Cox11 exists as a dimer when fusion-tagged or cleaved. This is consistent with its postulated role as the CuB chaperone. CcO is a dimer in the crystal lattices and often in detergent-solubilized forms (21Musatov A. Tobinson N.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4371-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). If CcO is dimeric within the mitochondrial inner membrane, four coppers for the CuA site and two coppers for the CuB site are required. A single Cox11 dimer could reasonably be expected to deliver two copper atoms to a dimer of CcO. XAS shows a Cu-Cu interaction at 2.71 Å, although the copper-to-protein ratio is consistently 1:1. It is likely that the copper-binding site of Cox11 exists as a binuclear cluster at the interface of the dimerization domain, which may be useful for copper delivery. The absence of significant luminescence when excited at 300 nm suggests that the copper site is not a solvent-shielded cluster. Solvent exposure may be useful mechanistically, as the putative loading of copper from Cox17 to Cox11 may be transient in the relay to CcO, and the binding site must be accessible to the target protein. Additionally, although this site is solvent-exposed in the purified protein, the protein in vivo may be folded with the copper site facing the inner mitochondrial membrane for delivery to Cox1. At present, the likely model for the copper site of Cox11 contains two trigonal copper atoms facing each other. It is unclear whether three ligands for each copper atom come from a single polypeptide, or if the ligation of a single copper atom is accomplished by a combination of cysteines from both polypeptides. One model is the trigonal sites in each monomer being closely juxtaposed giving a close 2.7 Å Cu-Cu distance. Precedence exists for two closely spaced trigonal sites (36Chadha R.K. Kumar R. Tuck D.G. Polyhedron. 1988; 7: 1121-1128Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TrxCox11 was dimeric under all conditions investigated; nevertheless, local concentrations of Cox11 in the mitochondrial membrane may be low enough to allow dissociation of Cox11 dimers. In fact, interaction with target proteins and thus copper transfer may require the monomeric state. An example of this is the copper transfer from the CCS metallochaperone to apo-superoxide dismutase (Sod1). Sod1 is a stable dimer, and yeast CCS (Lys7) exists in a monomer/dimer equilibrium (22Hall L.T. Sanchez R.J. Holloway S.P. Zhu H. Stine J.E. Lyons T.J. Demeler B. Schirf V. Hansen J.C. Nersissian A.M. Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3611-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), yet copper transfer from CCS to Sod1 occurs through a heterodimeric intermediate (23Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 24Torres A.S. Petri V. Rae T.D. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38410-38416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similarly, Cox11 may contact both the mitochondrial copper shuttle and the target protein, forming a heterodimer first with its copper donor, Cox17, then with the ultimate acceptor, Cox1. Studies are in progress to elucidate whether Cox11 interacts directly with either Cox17 or Cox1. It is possible that Cox11 requires other protein partners to be fully functional. The genome of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains a COX11 homolog with a significant 5′-extension. Basic local alignment of that gene with the non-redundant data base shows that the decoded N terminus of the S. pombeCox11 shares significant homology with the S. cerevisiaeprotein Rsm22. Rsm22 is a mitochondrial ribosome protein (25Saveanu C. Fromont-Racine M. Harington A. Ricard F. Namane A. Jacquier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15861-15867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that is necessary for respiratory growth (data not shown). Another known example of a fusion protein found in the genome of S. pombeis the Cox15/Yah1 fusion (11Barros M.H. Carlson C.G. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which function in the biosynthesis of heme a (26Barros M.H. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

We suggest that, similar to Cox15/Yah1, Cox11 and Rsm22 function in concert to capture the nascent Cox1 polypeptide and, with the help of other proteins known to be important in the translation and assembly of Cox1-Cox3 (27McMullin T.W.

Rather than occurring after assembly of the multisubunit complex, insertion of heme a and copper cofactors in CcO may occur co-translationally. Indeed, there is evidence that heme a insertion may occur prior to association of Cox1 with other subunits (34Nijtmans L.G. Taanman J.W. Muijsers A.O. Speijer D. Van den Bogert C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The co-translational insertion of cofactors in CcO subunits may be a key component in the assembly of the active complex.

https://openalex.org/W1992931605,"We have identified three genes,gst1 +, gst2 +, andgst3 +, encoding θ-class glutathioneS-transferases (GSTs) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The gst1 + andgst2 + genes encode closely related proteins (79% identical). Our analysis suggests that Gst1, Gst2, and Gst3 all have GST activity with the substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and that Gst3 has glutathione peroxidase activity. Although Gst1 and Gst2 have no detectable peroxidase activity, all three gst genes are required for normal cellular resistance to peroxides.

Collectively, our data suggest that GSTs have separate and overlapping roles in oxidative stress and drug responses in fission yeast. All organisms have evolved protective mechanisms and programmed responses to limit cellular damage from exposure to toxic compounds in their environment. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathioneS-transferase; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ROS, reactive oxygen species; GSH, reduced glutathione; CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; hGSTT1, human glutathione S-transferase θ; tBOOH, tetrabutylhydroperoxide. are evolutionarily conserved enzymes that are important in the detoxification of many xenobiotic compounds. These enzymes catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to electrophilic substrates, producing compounds that are generally less reactive and more soluble. This facilitates their removal from the cell via membrane-based glutathione conjugate pumps. The broad substrate specificity of GSTs allows them to protect cells against a range of toxic chemicals (1Salinas A.E. Wong M.G. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 279-309PubMed Google Scholar). However, GST activity can sometimes be deleterious to the cell. For example, dihaloalkanes are bioactivated by conjugation with glutathione, generating more genotoxic metabolites (2Sherratt P.J. Manson M.M. Thomson A.M. Hissink E.A. Neal G.E. van Bladeren P.J. Green T. Hayes J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, amino acid sequence analysis has identified several subgroups of soluble GSTs that appear to have evolved from the θ-prototype found in vertebrates, insects, plants, and bacteria (1Salinas A.E. Wong M.G. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 279-309PubMed Google Scholar,3Pemble S.E. Taylor J.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells also contain a distinct microsomal GST family of enzymes, but these endoplasmic reticulum membrane-associated enzymes have evolved separately from the soluble GSTs (4Hayes J.D. Strange R.C. Pharmacology. 2000; 61: 154-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). The prevalence of GSTs, together with the evidence suggesting their importance in bioactivation and detoxification of cytotoxic and genotoxic compounds, have stimulated many investigations into the potential role of these enzymes in disease. For example, epidemiological studies have established the absence of certain GST isozymes as an indicator of susceptibility to specific cancers (5Strange R.C. Fryer A.A. IARC Sci. Publ. 1999; 148: 231-249PubMed Google Scholar), and GSTpi null mice are more susceptible to carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis (6Henderson C.J. Smith A.G. Ure J. Brown K. Bacon E.J. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5275-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). There is also much interest in the regulation of cellular GST activity as increased expression of GSTs in tumor cells is frequently associated with multidrug resistance (1Salinas A.E. Wong M.G. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 279-309PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence of aerobic growth, organisms are exposed to damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide. GSTs have long been suspected to be important in protecting cells from oxidative stress by detoxifying some of the secondary ROS produced when ROS react with cellular constituents. For example, GSTs are able to conjugate glutathione to the toxic reactive compounds, 4-hydroxynonenal and cholesterol α-oxide, which are generated during the oxidation of membranes (7Hubatsch I. Ridderstrom M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 8Danielson U.H. Esterbauer H. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The glutathione peroxidase activity of some GST proteins also suggests that they may be important in the detoxification of organic hydroperoxides (9Tan K.L. Board P.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Sherratt P.J. Pulford D.J. Harrison D.J. Green T. Hayes J.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 11Zhao T. Singhal S.S. Piper J.T. Cheng J. Pandya U. Clark-Wronski J. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, although several studies have correlated high GST levels with increased resistance to oxidative stress, there is little direct evidence establishing that GSTs are important for the protection of cells from oxidative stress (12Hayes J.D. McLellan L.I. Free Rad. Biol. Med. Res. 1999; 31: 273-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Cells respond to oxidative stress by inducing the expression of genes whose products protect the cell, for example, by repairing stress-related damage or by inactivating ROS. In the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe, the regulation of oxidative stress-responsive genes is mediated by the Sty1 stress-activated protein kinase (also known as Spc1) through its downstream target, the Atf1 transcription factor, and by the redox-sensitive Pap1 transcription factor (13Toone W.M. Jones N. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent work (14Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) has established that GSTs may have a wider role in the response to cellular stress beyond their enzymatic activity. In particular, GSTs have been shown to act as stress-sensitive inhibitors of the mammalian stress-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, which help maintain c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase in an inactive form in unstressed cells (14Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified three GSTs, Gst1, Gst2, and Gst3, inS. pombe. We show that each of these proteins has associated GST activity. We also demonstrate that the expression of thegst1 +, gst2 +, andgst3 + genes is induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), whereas the expression ofgst2 + and gst3 + is strongly induced in stationary phase. All three GSTs are important for cellular resistance to oxidative stress; however, they have different roles in response to different types of oxidative stress. The S. pombe strains used in this study are shown in TableI. Yeast were grown at 30 °C in rich medium (YE5S) or in synthetic minimal medium (EMM2) as described previously (15Moreno S. Klar A.

Cells were grown for 3 days after reaching mid-log to achieve stationary phase.Table IS. pombe strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceCHP428h+ leu1–32 ura4-D18 his7–366 ade6–210Laboratory stockCHP429h− leu1–32 ura4-D18 his7–366 ade6–216Laboratory stockEV22h+ leu1–32 ura4-D18 his7–366 ade6–210 gst1∷ura4+This studyEV23h+ leu1–32 ura4-D18 his7–366 ade6–210 gst2∷ura4+This studyEV24h− leu1–32 ura4-D18 his7–366 ade6–216 gst1∷ura4+This studyEV25h+ leu1–32 ura4-D18 his7–366 ade6 gst1∷ura4+ gst2∷ura4+This studyEV26h− leu1–32 ura4-D18 his7–366 ade6 gst3∷ura4+This study972h−D.

Thegst1Δgst2Δ mutant was obtained by matinggst1Δ and gst2Δ strains. Thegst3Δ mutant was obtained by sporulation of a CHP428/CHP429 diploid in which one copy of the gst3 +gene was replaced with ura4 +. Each of the gst1 +,gst2 +, and gst3 + open reading frames was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using an N-terminal-specific oligonucleotide primer containing anNdeI restriction site in-frame with the ATG start codon and a C-terminal-specific oligonucleotide primer containing aBamHI restriction site. PCR products were digested withNdeI and BamHI and ligated into theNdeI and BamHI sites of pRep1 (17Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), pRep41FLAG (a gift of Simon Whitehall), and pRep42HMN (18Craven R.A. Griffiths D.J. Sheldrick K.S. Randall R.E.

Mid-log cells (A 600nm = 0.2–0.5) were diluted 10-, 100-, and 1000-fold. 5 μl of each dilution and undiluted cells was spotted onto YE5S plates containing different concentrations of oxidizing agent. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days until sufficient growth had taken place to allow discrimination of any changes in sensitivity. Mid-log cells were harvested and flash-frozen. Thawed cell pellets were washed then resuspended in 200 μl of protein lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 g/100 ml Nonidet P-40 with 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 ml/100 ml aprotinin). Cells were lysed by vortexing with 2.5 ml glass beads for 45 s, cooling on ice, and then vortexing for an additional 45 s. Proteins were washed from the beads with an additional 500 μl of protein lysis buffer. Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30min. Protein concentrations were estimated using Coomassie assay protein reagent (Pierce), and equivalent amounts of protein were used in all experiments. GST activity was measured using assays based on the methods of Habig et al. (19Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 25–50 μl of freshly prepared cell lysate was mixed in a cuvette with 1 ml of GST assay buffer containing either 1 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and 1 mm reduced glutathione [GSH] or 1 mm 4-nitrobenzylchloride and 5 mm GSH in 0.11 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, and incubated at room temperature. The absorbance (CDNB, 340 nm; 4-nitrobenzylchloride, 310 nm) was measured at timed intervals, and the specific GST activity of each lysate was determined from the increase in absorbance, the time between measurements (min) and the amount of protein (μg). Glutathione peroxidase activity was measured using a modification of the methods of Lawrence and Burk (20Lawrence R.A. Burk R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar) and Avery et al. (21Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). 50 μl of freshly prepared cell lysate was mixed in a cuvette with 1 ml of glutathione peroxidase assay buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 0.2 mm NADPH, 1 EU/ml glutathione reductase (Sigma), and 1 mm GSH). After a 5-min equilibration, the reaction was started by the addition of 20 μl of 69 mm cumene hydroperoxide. The oxidation of NADPH was monitored by recording the absorbance at 340 nm at timed intervals after starting the reaction. The specific glutathione peroxidase activity of each lysate was determined from the decrease in NADPH divided by the time between measurements (min) and the amount of protein (μg). Controls omitting protein were used to correct for the non-enzymatic degradation of NADPH. Cells from mid-log and stationary phase cultures in YE5S media were treated as indicated, and then 25 ml harvested at each time point. RNA was prepared by a hot phenol method essentially as described by White et al. (22White J.H. Green S.R. Barker D.G. Dumas L.B. Johnston L.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 171: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 5 μg of total RNA was denatured with glyoxal, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a GeneScreen hybridization membrane (PerkinElmer NEN Life Sciences). Gene-specific probes were prepared from PCR-generated fragments by labeling with 32P using a DNA Megaprime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization conditions were as described in the GeneScreen protocol. A probe for hmg1 + was used as a loading control. FLAG-tagged proteins were partially purified from cell lysates using anti-FLAG (M2) antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to ProtranTMnitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Nonspecific interactions were blocked with 10 g/100 ml milk in TTBS (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, and 0.1 ml/100 ml Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature. The blocked membrane was incubated with monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10) or anti-FLAG (M2) mouse antibodies (Sigma) diluted 1/1000 with TTBS containing 5 g/100 ml bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed with TTBS before incubation with peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Sigma) diluted 1/2000 with TTBS containing 5 g/100 ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the membrane was washed with TTBS and then incubated with ECL™ (AmershamBiosciences) chemiluminescent substrates and exposed to x-ray film (Fuji) for an appropriate length of time. Fixation and immunofluorescence were carried out using a modification of the methods of Hagan and Ayscough (23Hagan I. Ayscough K.R. Allan V.J. Protein Localization by Fluorescence Microscopy. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 179-206Google Scholar). Mid-log and stationary phase cells were fixed by agitation with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PEM (100 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 1.0 mm EGTA, and 1.0 mmMgSO4) for 30 min at 30 °C. Fixed cells were washed and then resuspended in PEM containing 1.2 m sorbitol and 20 mg/ml zymolyase and incubated at 37 °C for 70 min to spheroplast. Spheroplasted cells were resuspended in 1.2 m sorbitol, 1% Triton X-100 in PEM for 2 min, washed with PEM, and then blocked with PEMBAL (PEM containing 100 mm lysine, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% sodium azide) for 30 min with rotation at room temperature. The cells were resuspended in monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10) antibodies (Sigma) diluted 1/1000 with PEMBAL and agitated overnight at room temperature. Cells were washed with PEMBAL and then incubated for 1 h with polyclonal fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Sigma) diluted 1/50 in PEMBAL. The immunostained cells were washed with PEM and then dried onto a glass microscope slide. The cells were fixed to the slide by immersion in −20 °C methanol for 6 min followed by immersion in −20 °C acetone for 30 s and then mounted in VectashieldTMcontaining 1.5 μg/ml DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Vector Laboratories). DAPI-stained nuclei and anti-Myc immunofluorescence were visualized by excitation at 365 nm (DAPI) and 450–490 nm (fluorescein isothiocyanate) under a ×63 oil immersion lens using a Zeiss Axioscope fluorescence microscope and digital imaging system (Axiovision).

Nature. 2002; 415: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar) revealed three open reading frames that encoded proteins with significant homology to human glutathioneS-transferase θ (hGSTT1). We have named these genesgst1 + (SPCC191.09c), gst2 +(SPCC965.07c), and gst3 + (SPAC688.04c) (Fig.1). Notably, gst1 + andgst2 + encode very closely related proteins (79% identical). A comparison of the sequences of these three putative GSTs fromS. pombe with the consensus sequence derived for the θ-class GST enzymes (Fig. 1, GSTθ consensus) (25Rossjohn J. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Wilce M.C. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) revealed conservation at 31 and 32 of the 34 amino acid positions in Gst1 and Gst2, respectively. The GSTθ consensus sequence contains six amino acids that are only conserved within the θ-class GSTs (Fig. 1, shown in red). These six amino acids include the serine that is involved in glutathione conjugation in Lucilia cuprinaGSTθ (26Board P.G. Coggan M. Wilce M.C. Parker M.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 27Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Nicotra M. Battistoni A. Bello M.L. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Ricci G. J. Biol.

The spacing between this serine and the rest of the GSTθ consensus sequence is variable (25Rossjohn J. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Wilce M.C. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Indeed, although Gst1 and Gst2 contain all six of the residues that are specific for the θ-family of GSTs, the conserved serine and the first three hydrophobic residues of the GSTθ consensus sequence are four amino acids further from the rest of the GSTθ consensus than they are in hGSTT1 (Fig. 1). Gst3 matched the GST consensus at 28 of the 34 amino acid positions and contained 3 of the 6 amino acid residues that are only conserved among θ-class GSTs. However, Gst3 has a serine residue at position 46 instead of the asparagine present at this position in all other GSTθ enzymes, and the residue in Gst3 that is most likely to be involved in glutathione conjugation is unclear. The similarity of Gst1, Gst2, and Gst3 to GSTs from other organisms suggests that they have GST activity. However, studies of Ure2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which also has extensive homology with other GSTs (28Coschigano P.W. Magasanik B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and Gst1 and Gst2 from S. pombe, have been unable to detect any GST activity (data not shown) (29Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Hence, to examine whether Gst1, Gst2, or Gst3 had GST activity, gst1 +,gst2 + , and gst3 + were ligated into the pRep1 plasmid to allow high levels of expression inS. pombe. GST activity assays were then performed using lysates prepared from wild-type cells containing these plasmids. The overexpression of Gst1, Gst2, or Gst3 significantly increased the GST activity of cell lysate when assayed with the model GST substrate CDNB (Fig. 2 A). However, the same cell lysates did not have increased cellular GST activity toward the substrate 4-nitrobenzylchloride (Fig. 2 A). Certain θ-class GST enzymes including hGSTT1 have been shown to have glutathione peroxidase activity (26Board P.G. Coggan M. Wilce M.C. Parker M.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Hence, we also investigated whether the overexpression of Gst1, Gst2, or Gst3 increased the glutathione peroxidase activity of cell lysate. Interestingly, only the overexpression of Gst3 caused any substantial increase in the peroxidase activity of cell lysate against cumene hydroperoxide (Fig.2 A). Controls omitting glutathione revealed that this peroxidase activity was specific to glutathione (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that Gst1, Gst2, and Gst3 all have GST activity and that Gst3 has glutathione peroxidase activity. To assess the contributions of Gst1, Gst2, and Gst3 to cellular GST activity, the GST-encoding genes were individually deleted to give gst1Δ, gst2Δ, and gst3Δ strains. The fact that Gst1 and Gst2 are 79% identical suggested that they might have overlapping functions, so agst1Δgst2Δ double mutant was also generated. The GST activities of cell lysates prepared from thegst1Δ, gst2Δ, gst3Δ, andgst1Δgst2Δ mutant strains were analyzed and compared with the GST activity of wild-type lysate. The lysates prepared from exponentially growing cells were found to have very low GST activity, preventing accurate comparisons; therefore, no significant difference between the GST activity of any of the mutant strains and the wild-type could be detected (data not shown). However, consistent with the increased GST expression reported in stationary phase S. cerevisiae cells (29Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the GST activity of lysate prepared from stationary phase wild-type S. pombe was 2–3-fold higher than that of lysates from mid-log cells (data not shown). However, the GST activities of stationary phasegst2Δ- and gst1Δgst2Δ-derived lysates were reproducibly lower than those of the wild-type (Fig.2 B). A preliminary analysis suggests that this is because there is no increase in GST activity in gst2Δ andgst1Δgst2Δ cells as they enter stationary phase (data not shown). The GST activity of stationary phasegst3Δ cell lysate was slightly reduced compared with the wild-type, whereas the GST activities of gst1Δ cell lysates were consistently slightly higher than those of wild-type cell lysates. These data demonstrate that the increase in cellular GST activity in stationary phase is predominately dependent on Gst2. The observed increase in cellular GST activity in stationary phase wild-type cells prompted us to investigate whether this reflected changes in the expression of thegst genes. Hence, RNA was extracted from exponentially growing (mid-log) and stationary phase cells and analyzed by Northern blotting. This analysis revealed that gst2 + andgst3 + mRNA are both at much higher levels in stationary phase cells (Fig. 3), whereasgst1 + mRNA levels, although difficult to detect, are relatively unchanged (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Together with the analysis of GST activity of stationary phase wild-type andgst mutant cells, these data suggest that the increased GST activity in stationary phase cells is because of increased expression of gst2 + and gst3 +. To determine whether the expression of individual gst genes was affected by the mutation of other gst genes,gst mRNA levels were examined in wild-type andgst mutant cells. This examination revealed that the changes in GST activity observed in gst1Δ, gst2Δ,gst1Δgst2Δ, and gst3Δ cell lysates (Fig.2 B) are unlikely to be attributed to indirect effects on the expression of the remaining gst genes. Eukaryotic cytosolic GST enzymes are usually found as homodimers, although heterodimers between different GST enzymes have also been reported. Hence, we examined whether each of the GST proteins could form homodimers and/or heterodimers with the other GSTs. Potential in vivo protein-protein interactions between the GST proteins were examined by immunoprecipitation experiments. Anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose was used to immunopurify FLAG-tagged Gst1, Gst2, or Gst3 from wild-type cells co-expressing different combinations of FLAG and Myc epitope-tagged GST proteins. These immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibodies to determine whether the co-expressed Myc-tagged GST was present in the immunocomplex with the FLAG-tagged GST. These analyses revealed that Gst1 and Gst2 are able to form homodimers and also Gst1-Gst2 heterodimers. However, although Gst3 was able to form homodimers, Gst3 did not form heterodimers with either Gst1 or Gst2 (Fig. 4). The epitope-tagged GST proteins had mobilities consistent with those predicted from their primary amino acid sequences, and their expression also increased the GST activities of cell lysates, indicating that neither epitope tag affects the function of the protein (data not shown). The identity of the proteins producing the additional minor bands is unknown. It is possible that they are derived from immunoglobulins from the anti-FLAG-agarose or breakdown products of the Gst proteins. Previous studies have shown that GSTs localize to different parts of the cell. For example, Gtt1 in S. cerevisiae, is found to be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (29Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the mammalian κ-family of soluble GSTs are located in mitochondria (30Pemble S.E. Wardle A.F. Taylor J.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and murine GSTθ accumulates in the nucleus under certain stress conditions (12Hayes J.D. McLellan L.I. Free Rad. Biol. Med. Res. 1999; 31: 273-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). The data described above suggests that Gst1 and Gst2 may act together in the cell, whereas Gst3 has a separate role. Hence, to test this hypothesis further, we examined the cellular distribution of each GST protein. To determine the cellular localization of Gst1, Gst2, and Gst3, wild-type cells containing pRep42-based plasmids expressing each GST fused to an N-terminal Myc epitope were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-Myc antibodies. This analysis revealed that Gst1 and Gst2 were found throughout the cell, whereas, in contrast, Myc-tagged Gst3 was excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Similar localization patterns were observed in both exponentially growing and stationary phase cells, which suggests that it is unlikely that the increased GST activity in wild-type stationary phase cells reflects a change in the cellular distribution of any of these three proteins. The similar distributions of Gst1 and Gst2 are consistent with them being able to form heterodimers (Fig. 4). These data also support the hypothesis that Gst3 may have a separate role from Gst1 and Gst2. The expression of some mammalian GSTs increases in response"

Calcineurin-dependent signals are transduced to the nucleus by nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) transcription factors that undergo nuclear translocation upon dephosphorylation and promote transcriptional activation of target genes. Several endogenous proteins are capable of inhibiting the catalytic activity of calcineurin. Modulatorycalcineurin interacting protein 1 (MCIP1) is unique among these proteins on the basis of its pattern of expression and its function in a negative feedback loop to regulate calcineurin activity. Here we show that MCIP1 can be phosphorylated by MAPK and glycogen synthase kinase-3 and that phosphorylated MCIP1 is a substrate for calcineurin. Peptides corresponding to the substrate domain competitively inhibit calcineurin activity in vitro. However, a detailed structure/function analysis of MCIP1 reveals that either of two additional domains of MCIP1 is sufficient for binding to calcineurin in vitro and for inhibition of calcineurin activity in vivo. We conclude that MCIP1 inhibits calcineurin through mechanisms that include, but are not limited to, competition with other substrates such as nuclear factor of activated T-cells.

The calcineurin enzyme is composed of a catalytic A subunit (CnA) and a regulatory B subunit (CnB). The binding of CnB, an EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein, is necessary but not sufficient for enzymatic activity of CnA. Protein phosphatase activity of calcineurin is activated upon binding of Ca2+-bound calmodulin. Calmodulin binding displaces an autoinhibitory domain (AID) located at the C-terminal portion of calcineurin, which otherwise masks the active site. Constitutively active forms of calcineurin are generated by deletion of the calmodulin binding domain and AID (17O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and cyclosporin exert their effects by promoting the formation of complexes between CnA and FKBP12 or cyclophilin A, respectively (18Liu J. Farmer J.D., Jr. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar). Several other cellular inhibitors of calcineurin have also been identified. AKAP79 is a scaffolding protein that co-localizes protein kinase A and calcineurin to specific locations within the cell and has been shown to inhibit the protein phosphatase activity of calcineurin (19Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Cabin1/Cain was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a calcineurin-binding protein and is capable of inhibiting nuclear translocation of NFAT and calcium-dependent activation of the IL-2 promoter in T-cells (20Sun L. Youn H.D. Loh C. Stolow M., He, W. Liu J.O. Immunity. 1998; 8: 703-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Calcineurin B homology protein shares a high degree of similarity with the CnB subunit but inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity in vitro and prevents NFAT translocation when overexpressed in Jurkat cells (21Lin X. Sikkink R.A. Rusnak F. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36125-36131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Modulatory calcineurin-interacting proteins (MCIPs) represent a new class of endogenous calcineurin inhibitors (22Fuentes J.J. Genesca L. Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Perez-Riba M.

Cox G.M. Perfect J.R. Heitman J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3618-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Three mammalian MCIP genes have been identified: MCIP1/DSCR1, MCIP2/DSCR1L1, and MCIP3/DSCR1L2. Orthologues of MCIP genes are present in numerous organisms, including unicellular eukaryotes (26Strippoli P. Petrini M. Lenzi L. Carinci P. Zannotti M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All members of this family examined to date are capable of binding and inhibiting calcineurin, but each of the MCIP mammalian genes exhibit distinctive patterns of gene regulation. For example, expression of one particular splice variant of theMCIP1 gene is activated potently by calcineurin due to the presence of multiple consensus NFAT binding sites within an internal promoter region (27Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E61-E68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription of other splice variants of MCIP1 is initiated from different promoters and is not responsive to calcineurin activation. Likewise, expression of the MCIP2gene is not activated by calcineurin but responds to thyroid hormone (27Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E61-E68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MCIP1 is unique, therefore, among known calcineurin inhibitory proteins because it can function as an endogenous feedback inhibitor. MCIP proteins share a structural motif with NFAT proteins termed the SP repeat domain. Peptides derived from the SP repeat domain of human MCIP1 were shown previously to inhibit calcineurin activity (23Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1595-1604PubMed Google Scholar), but here we examine the calcineurin inhibitory properties of MCIP1 protein in greater detail. MCIP1 itself can serve as a substrate for protein phosphatase activity of calcineurin, thereby providing a mechanism for competitive inhibition of the enzyme. Although the SP repeat of MCIP is sufficient for competitive inhibition of calcineurin activity in vitro, this region is neither necessary nor sufficient for either binding or inhibition of calcineurin in vivo. At least two additional and discrete domains from the MCIP1 protein are capable of inhibiting calcineurin in vivo in the absence of the SP repeat domain and are sufficient to bind calcineurin and to block NFAT binding in vitro. These findings support a competitive antagonist function for MCIP1 with respect to calcineurin action on NFAT proteins but suggest complex modes of interaction that may include additional inhibitory mechanisms. C2C12 myoblasts were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. Reporter gene assays were performed on myoblasts plated on 12-well culture dishes transfected with 0.5 μg of each plasmid unless noted otherwise using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested ∼40 h after transfection in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). β-galactosidase activity was measured using the Galacto-light Plus system (Tropix, Inc.) and used to normalize the reporter assay results. All transfection data are presented as means (with standard errors of mean) of two or three separate transfection experiments each done in triplicate. The mouse MCIP1 deletions were generated by PCR using the following primers: MCIP1 forward, 5′-ATGGATTTTTAGGGACTTT-3′; MCIP197 forward, 5′-TCTGGCTCCGCCCAATCCCGAC-3′; MCIP1124 forward, 5′-TGCCACCCCCGTCATAAATTAC-3′; MCIP1 reverse, 5′-TCAGCTAAGGTGGATCGGTGT-3′; MCIP1177 reverse, 5′-TACATTCTCTCCA-3′; MCIP1161 reverse, 5′-TCACACGTGGACCACCACACT-3′; MCIP1102 reverse, 5′-TTAGTCGGGATTGGGCGGAGC-3′.

The vector encoding full-length rat calcineurin subunit (a gift from Diane Barber, University of California San Francisco) was described previously (21Lin X. Sikkink R.A. Rusnak F. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36125-36131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The bacterial expression vector GST·MCIP1 was constructed by subcloning a cDNA fragment encoding the mouse MCIP1 protein into the EcoRI site of the pGexCS vector (29Parks T.D. Leuther K.K. Howard E.D. Johnston S.A. Dougherty W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). GST·NFAT contains the first 306 amino acid residues of the human NFATc2 protein in the pGexCS vector (13Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M., Wu, H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). For yeast two-hybrid experiments, a DNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–398 of the calcineurin A subunit (CnA*) was ligated into theEcoRI site of the pBridge vector (CLONTECH), placing it in-frame with the Gal4 DNA binding domain (CnA*-BD). A cDNA fragment encoding the mouse MCIP1 protein linked in-frame with a nuclear localization sequence was ligated into the NotI and BglII sites of pBridge CnA*-BD vector, creating pBridge CnA*-BD/MCIP(−Met) plasmid. This pBridge plasmid construction places MCIP1 expression under the control of the Pmet promoter, thereby expressing nuclear-localized MCIP1 protein in the absence of methionine (−Met). In addition, a cDNA fragment encoding full-length MCIP1 was ligated into the pACT2 vector (CLONTECH) in-frame with the Gal4 activation domain (MCIP-AD). The VIVIT peptide (30Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) was fused to the Gal4 activation domain (VIVIT-AD) by annealing the oligonucleotides 5′-CATGGCCGGACCACACCCGGTAATTGTAAATTACAGGACCCCACGAGG-3′ and 5′-AATTCCTCGTGGGGTCCTGTAATTACAATTACCGGGTGTGGTCCGGC-3′ and ligating to the pACT2 vector. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with mammalian expression constructs encoding full-length calcineurin A and GFP or each of the GFP-MCIP fusion constructs. Forty h after transfection, cells were lysed in 500 μl of pull-down buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 10 min. Twenty-five μl of calmodulin-agarose (Sigma) equilibrated with pull-down buffer was added to the cleared lysate, and the sample was rotated at 4 °C for 1h. The calmodulin-agarose beads were washed three times with 500 μl of pull-down buffer, resuspended in an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and boiled for 3 min. The proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for Western blot analysis. The membrane was probed with monoclonal antibodies recognizing GFP (CLONTECH) or c-Myc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). SuperSignal reagent (Pierce) was used for detection. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with an expression construct encoding human MCIP1 with an N-terminal c-Myc affinity tag. Cells were lysed 18 h after transfection in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Triton X-100 and Complete Protease Inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min and treated with 1 unit of calf alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 100 μl of cleared lysate at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were processed for Western blot analysis as described above. Recombinant GST·MCIP1 and GST·NFAT proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was phosphorylated in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl) with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) with p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Sigma) or protein kinase A (Sigma) at 30 °C for 30 min. Phosphorylation by GSK-3 (Calbiochem) was performed by first phosphorylating GST·MCIP1 or GST·NFAT fusion protein with either MAPK (GST·MCIP) or protein kinase A (GST·NFAT) in the presence of non-labeled ATP. The GST fusion protein was then washed three times in kinase buffer and phosphorylated with GSK-3 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described above. After phosphorylation, the beads were washed three times and then resuspended in calcineurin assay buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MnCl2). Calmodulin was added to a final concentration of 2 μm along with increasing amounts of recombinant calcineurin enzyme and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The beads were spun down, resuspended in an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and boiled for 3 min. The proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and protein phosphorylation state was detected by autoradiography. A portion of the MCIP1 protein corresponding to the SP repeat peptide, HLAPPNPDKQFLISPPASPPVGWK, was synthesized at the Biopolymer Facility, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The calcineurin AID peptide was purchased from Biomol. A dose-response assay was performed in calcineurin assay buffer containing 200 μm RII peptide substrate (Biomol), 2 μm calmodulin, and 1 unit of calcineurin (Sigma) in the presence of varying concentrations of inhibitor peptide at 30 °C for 10 min. Free phosphate was detected by the addition of Malachite green reagent (Biomol) and measured at 620 λ. Lineweaver-Burk analysis of the SP repeat peptide was determined using the phosphatase assay performed as above except with 50, 100, 150, or 200 μm RII peptide substrate with either no inhibitor or a fixed 50 μm SP repeat peptide concentration. The MCIP-AD, VIVIT-AD, or pACT2 vector control were co-transformed with either CnA-BD or CnA-BD/MCIP(−Met) into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CG1945 as described by Schiestl and Gietz (31Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of the transformation reaction (1:1, 1:10, 1:100, 1:1000) were spotted on synthetic complete media plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and methionine. These plates were incubated at 30° for 72 h. Phosphorylation of residues within the SP repeat domain of NFAT results in sequestration of the protein in the cytoplasm. Subsequent dephosphorylation of these sites by calcineurin leads to nuclear translocation of NFAT and activation of target gene transcription. Consensus phosphorylation sites for p42/44 MAPK and GSK-3 are present in the SP repeat of MCIP1 at serine 112 and serine 108, respectively (Fig. 1A).In vitro kinase reactions were performed with recombinant MCIP1 proteins, either wild-type or mutated forms (S108A or S112A), to determine whether MCIP1 could be phosphorylated by MAPK or GSK-3 at these positions. As shown in Fig. 1B, MAPK was capable of phosphorylating MCIP1 uniquely at serine 112. GSK-3 phosphorylates serine or threonine residues 4 amino acids N-terminal to another phosphorylated serine or threonine. Thus, a potential GSK-3 phosphorylation site is created at serine 108 after phosphorylation of serine 112 by MAPK. Following phosphorylation by MAPK in the presence of unlabeled ATP, MCIP1 was labeled by GSK-3 and [γ-32P]ATP. Mutational analysis confirmed that this phosphorylation event occurs at serine 108 since MCIP S108A was not phosphorylated by GSK-3. As expected, mutation of the MAPK phosphorylation site, serine 112, also prevented subsequent phosphorylation by GSK-3. Simultaneous phosphorylation of MCIP1 by MAPK and GSK-3 with labeled ATP confirmed these observations, and mutation of serine 112 prevented phosphorylation of MCIP1 by either kinase. Because the phosphorylated SP repeats of NFAT serve as calcineurin substrates, we sought to determine whether the same was true of MCIP1 (Fig. 1C). MCIP1 was phosphorylated on serine 112 and 108 by MAPK and GSK-3, respectively. In addition, recombinant NFAT was phosphorylated by protein kinase A or GSK-3 to serve as a positive control. Increasing amounts of calcineurin were used to dephosphorylate the proteins. Although calcineurin efficiently dephosphorylated NFAT labeled by either protein kinase A or GSK-3, only the form of MCIP1 labeled by GSK-3 at serine 108 was dephosphorylated by calcineurin. These data suggest that MCIP can serve as a calcineurin substrate and may possibly act as a competitive inhibitor of calcineurin with respect to NFAT and other substrates, such as MEF-2 transcription factors (5Wu H. Naya F.J. McKinsey T.A. Mercer B. Shelton J.M. Chin E.R. Simard A.R. Michel R.N. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Williams R.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1963-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been shown that peptides corresponding to the SP repeat of MCIP1 are capable of inhibiting calcineurin activity in vitro with respect to a synthetic (RII) substrate (23Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1595-1604PubMed Google Scholar). The RII peptide, derived from the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A, is a well characterized calcineurin substrate. Based on our findings that the SP repeat domain of MCIP1 is a substrate of calcineurin, we examined the mechanism of inhibition using an in vitro calcineurin assay with the RII peptide substrate. The SP repeat peptide, a 24-mer peptide spanning the SP repeat domain of MCIP1, was compared with a peptide derived from the AID of calcineurin, which is known to inhibit calcineurin activity (25Gorlach J. Fox D.S. Cutler N.S. Cox G.M. Perfect J.R. Heitman J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3618-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 32Hashimoto Y. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1924-1927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A dose-response curve based on increasing concentrations of peptide demonstrated that the SP repeat from MCIP1 inhibited calcineurin activity (Ki = 91.5 μm), although at a somewhat lesser efficiency than the AID peptide (Ki= 36 μm) (Fig.2A). An assessment of the inhibitory mechanism of the SP repeat peptide was made using varying substrate concentrations against a fixed concentration of inhibitor peptide. The results shown in Fig. 2B (no change in theVmax but an increase in theKm) are consistent with the SP repeat peptide acting as a competitive inhibitor of calcineurin. Previous studies have suggested that the C terminus of the MCIP1 protein is critical for binding to and inhibition of calcineurin (22Fuentes J.J. Genesca L. Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Perez-Riba M. Estivill X. de la Luna S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but more precise definition of domains within MCIP1 that participate in its inhibitory activity has been lacking. Truncated or mutated forms of MCIP1 protein were fused to GFP (as illustrated in Fig. 3A) and tested for their ability to inhibit calcineurin. The GFP moiety was added to stabilize the MCIP1 fragments so as to achieve comparable expression of each variant, which was confirmed by immunoblot experiments using anti-GFP antibody (an example is shown as Input in Fig.5B). Each of these GFP-MCIP constructs was co-transfected with CnA* and a luciferase reporter gene controlled by a calcineurin-responsive promoter, NRE-Luc. As shown in Fig.3B, fusion of GFP to full-length MCIP did not impair its ability to inhibit calcineurin. Surprisingly, removal of the C-terminal half of MCIP (GFP-MCIP1–102), including the SP repeat, did not significantly alter its ability to inhibit calcineurin. In addition, removal of the N-terminal portion of MCIP (GFP-MCIP97–198, GFP-MCIP124–198) did not affect its inhibitory function. However, MCIP1 function is abolished when amino acids from both the N terminus and C terminus of the protein are deleted (GFP-MCIP97–161). These data suggest that domains in either the N-terminal half or the C terminus of the protein are sufficient to inhibit calcineurin activity. However, removal of both regions results in loss of MCIP inhibitory function. These differences in inhibitory potency among truncated forms of MCIP1 were confirmed by examination of dose-response relationships (Fig. 3C). As the ratio of MCIP to CnA* decreased, truncated forms of MCIP1 lacking the SP domain, MCIP102 and MCIP124–198, did not inhibit calcineurin activity to the same degree as the full-length MCIP198. Transfection assays performed with the MCIP1 exon 4 promoter region, another target of calcineurin (27Yang J. Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E61-E68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as the reporter construct instead of the NRE-Luc showed identical results to the NRE-Luc (data not shown).FIG. 5Identification of MCIP1 domains necessary for binding to calcineurin. Calmodulin-agarose pull-down assays were performed with lysates prepared from C2C12 myoblasts transfected with a Myc-tagged MCIP1 expression construct (+) or empty expression vector (−) (A). The input and pull-down fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies directed against calcineurin or the Myc tag. C2C12 myoblasts were co-transfected with GFP alone or the panel of GFP-MCIP1 fusion constructs (as shown in Fig. 3) and an expression vector encoding for the full-length calcineurin (B). GFP or GFP-MCIP1 was detected in the input or pull-down fractions by immunoblot analysis using an antibody directed against GFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The ability of MCIP1 to serve as a substrate for calcineurin (Fig. 1) is not essential for its function as an inhibitor of calcineurin.In vivo studies in C2C12 myoblasts show mutated forms of MCIP in which serine 108 or serine 112 are converted to alanines (Fig.4A) migrate faster by Western blot analysis as compared with wild-type MCIP1 (Fig. 4B). The faster migrating bands were confirmed as dephosphorylated forms of MCIP1 by alkaline phosphate (AP) treatment of the transfected cell lysates. A mutated form of MCIP1 with substitutions of the serines and prolines at amino acid positions 108, 109, 112, and 113 to alanine SP/AA retains full calcineurin inhibitory activity (Fig.4C). We have demonstrated previously, using in vitro binding assays, that MCIP is capable of binding calcineurin directly (24Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Yang J., Wu, H. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8719-8725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Here, physical associations with calcineurin were tested by in vitrobinding assays using full-length and truncated forms of GFP-MCIP and calmodulin covalently linked to agarose beads. As shown in Fig.5A, MCIP protein was readily detectable in the calmodulin/calcineurin complex. The presence of MCIP in the complex did not decrease the amount of bound calcineurin, demonstrating that MCIP does not interfere with calmodulin binding to calcineurin. MCIP1 protein does not bind directly to calmodulin-agarose since MCIP1 protein was not detected when calcineurin was omitted from the assay (data not shown). All GFP-MCIP deletions were detected in the calmodulin/calcineurin complex except for GFP-MCIP97–161 (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate that the SP repeat region is neither necessary nor sufficient for binding to calcineurin in cell homogenates. Therefore, MCIP1 has at least two calcineurin binding domains lying outside the SP repeat in both the N-terminal half of the protein and the more distal C-terminal region of the protein. High concentrations of a peptide based on the SP domain of MCIP1 are capable of inhibiting purified calcineurin (Fig. 2), and its presence may contribute to the inhibitory potency of the full-length protein in vivo (Fig. 3). MCIP has been shown to prevent calcineurin-mediated nuclear translocation of NFAT (22Fuentes J.J. Genesca L. Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Perez-Riba M. Estivill X. de la Luna S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has not been established whether this is solely a function of inhibition of protein phosphatase activity of calcineurin or whether MCIP also prevents binding of NFAT to calcineurin. Recently, a calcineurin docking domain of NFAT was localized to a small peptide motif (SPRIET) of the protein, and this sequence was optimized using a combinatorial peptide library to VIVIT (30Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). A yeast two-hybrid system was established to determine whether MCIP1 interferes with the interaction of CnA* and this calcineurin-binding VIVIT peptide (based on the NFAT sequence). As shown in Fig. 6, physical interactions between CnA* (fused to the Gal4 transcriptional binding domain) and the VIVIT peptide sequence (fused to the Gal4 DNA activation domain) were inhibited by concomitant expression of native MCIP1. The potency with which native MCIP1 blocked binding of VIVIT to CnA* was comparable with that at which native MCIP1 blocked binding of an MCIP1-Gal4 activation domain fusion protein to CnA*. This finding suggests that MCIP1 interferes with the interaction of calcineurin and the calcineurin docking domain of NFAT. Among a number of proteins known to function as endogenous inhibitors of calcineurin, MCIP proteins are distinctive in several respects. Unlike the intracellular targets for immunosuppressive drugs (cyclophilin and FKBP12), no exogenous molecules are required to promote their interaction with calcineurin. Unlike AKAP79 or cabin/cain, MCIP genes are expressed abundantly in heart and skeletal muscles, as well as in brain. Only MCIP1 is known to be transcriptionally up-regulated by calcineurin activity, thereby establishing a feedback inhibition loop. Insight into the mechanisms by which MCIP proteins inhibit calcineurin is important to understanding calcineurin signaling in the context of development, plasticity, and disease. Previous studies have shown MCIP to be a potent inhibitor of calcineurin signaling (22Fuentes J.J. Genesca L. Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Perez-Riba M. Estivill X. de la Luna S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1595-1604PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Yang J., Wu, H. Bassel-Duby R.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3618-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). MCIP inhibits calcineurin-mediated nuclear translocation of NFAT and activation of reporter gene constructs. MCIP forms a physical complex with the calcineurin A catalytic subunit in a manner that does not require the calmodulin binding domain of calcineurin (22Fuentes J.J. Genesca L. Kingsbury T.J.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8719-8725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In addition, MCIP proteins or peptides containing the highly conserved FLISPPASP sequence of the SP repeat domain were shown to inhibit calcineurin catalytic activityin vitro (23Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1595-1604PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gorlach J. Fox D.S. Cutler N.S. Cox G.M. Perfect J.R. Heitman J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3618-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). MCIP also blocks physiologic or pathologic changes produced by unrestrained calcineurin activity in intact animals. Transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active form of calcineurin in the heart develop profound cardiac hypertrophy that progresses to dilated cardiomyopathy (6Molkentin J.D., Lu, J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar). Expression of MCIP1 blocks cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure in this transgenic model (33Rothermel B.A. McKinsey T.A. Vega R.B. Nicol R.L. Mammen P. Yang J. Antos C.L. Shelton J.M. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3328-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The results presented here advance our understanding of MCIP:calcineurin interactions in several important ways. New data show that MCIP1 is itself a substrate for the protein phosphatase activity of calcineurin. A specific serine residue within the conserved SP repeat domain was phosphorylated by GSK-3 and dephosphorylated by calcineurin in vitro. Studies of CBP1, theCryptococcus neoformans orthologue of MCIP, suggest that CBP1 also is phosphorylated in vivo and is a substrate for calcineurin (25Gorlach J. Fox D.S. Cutler N.S. Cox G.M. Perfect J.R. Heitman J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3618-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A peptide based on this region of MCIP1 functions as a competitive inhibitor of calcineurin activity in vitro. The functional consequences of MCIP1 phosphorylation at serine 108 are unknown at this time, but non-phosphorylatable forms of MCIP1 retain full inhibitory activity, suggesting that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of MCIP1 has little bearing on its ability to inhibit calcineurin. Partitioning of MCIP1 between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the cell likewise appears to be unaffected by the phosphorylation state of MCIP1 at serine 108 (data not shown). Interestingly, SP repeat phosphorylation mutants of CBP-1 are unstable when compared with the wild-type protein (25Gorlach J. Fox D.S. Cutler N.S. Cox G.M. Perfect J.R. Heitman J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3618-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We speculate that the phosphorylation state of mammalian MCIP proteins also may control protein stability or influence binding to proteins other than calcineurin within the cell, and experiments are underway to test these hypotheses. Not surprisingly, we observed a direct correlation between the ability of truncated forms of MCIP1 to bind calcineurin in complex with calmodulin and their respective inhibitory potencies. An unexpected result, however, was the finding that both N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of MCIP1 are capable of binding and inhibiting calcineurin, even in the absence of the SP repeat domain. In vivo, the SP repeat domain of MCIP1 is insufficient to function as a calcineurin inhibitor when isolated from other regions of the protein. When MCIP1 associates with calcineurin, binding of a peptide based on the calcineurin docking domain of NFAT is blocked, but binding of calmodulin to calcineurin is unimpaired. Taken together, these data reveal complex mechanisms of calcineurin inhibition by MCIP. At least three discrete domains of MCIP1 participate in inhibiting calcineurin in vitro and/orin vivo. MCIP proteins are likely to function as competitive antagonists of calcineurin activity with respect to NFAT proteins and other calcineurin substrates. However, the data presented here raise the possibility of allosteric regulation of calcineurin activity as well. Future studies of these mechanisms would be most effectively guided by structural information based on x-ray crystallography of MCIP-calcineurin complexes. Inhibition of calcineurin activity by FK506 and cyclosporin A has been instrumental in the success of modern transplantation medicine in humans. However, systemic toxicity precludes the administration of current pharmacological antagonists of calcineurin in doses sufficient for the prevention of cardiac diseases, the pathobiology of which calcineurin-dependent signaling events have been shown to contribute to (34Haverich A. Costard-Jackle A. Cremer J. Herrmann G. Simon R. Transplant. Proc. 1994; 26: 2713-2715PubMed Google Scholar). An increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which endogenous proteins such as MCIP1 inhibit calcineurin may open new opportunities for preventive or therapeutic interventions by rational drug design.

These lesions are repaired in part by BER. There are at least two subpathways of BER, differentiated by the repair patch sizes and the enzymes involved, and these subpathways are classified as “single-nucleotide” and “long patch” BER, respectively (3Frosina G.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), yet these two proteins do not directly interact in solution. Finally, uracil-DNA glycosylase has been proposed to recruit APE to the AP site after release of uracil from uracil-DNA (24Parikh S.S. Putnam C.D. Tainer J.A. Mutat.

PCNA is known to interact with some of the BER enzymes, including FEN-1 and DNA ligase I (20Tomkinson A.E. Chen L. Dong Z. Leppard J.B. Levin D.S. Mackey Z.B. Motycka T.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) found that PCNA enhances β-pol-dependent long patch BER of AP sites by stimulating FEN-1 activity. No role, however, has been proposed for PCNA in single-nucleotide BER. PCNA is also well known as a component of the DNA replication system in mammalian cells, and it plays roles in multiple cellular pathways in addition to DNA replication and BER, including the following: nucleotide excision repair (32Nichols A.F.

Thus, PCNA has been termed a “cellular communicator” by virtue of its ability to connect various cellular processes (40Jonsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hubscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Finally, PCNA is known to function as a processivity factor for DNA polymerases such as pol δ and pol ε in vitro (41Stucki M. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Fortini P. Wilson S.H. Hubscher U. Dogliotti E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Whereas evaluating the question of potential interacting partners for mammalian β-pol in BER, we identified three short sequences (7–9 residues) that were similar to the PCNAinteracting motif or PIM in some of the known PCNA-binding proteins, and we subsequently found, by cell extract immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid experiments, that PCNA appeared to interact with β-pol in vivo. A possible direct interaction between β-pol and PCNA was examined using the purified samples of the two proteins and a combination of co-immunoprecipitation and overlay assay binding techniques. We found that the proteins interact directly and mapped a region of β-pol responsible for its interaction with PCNA to a sequence resembling a consensus PIM. These results and possible implications of the β-pol and PCNA interaction are discussed. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and GlutaMAX-1 were from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was from Summit Biotechnology (Ft. Collins, CO) and hygromycin was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Anti-β-pol affinity purified polyclonal antibody has been described previously (14Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

DNA was removed by chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, Resource S, and Superdex S200 columns (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 100 mm KCl. UV spectra were measured before and after each column step. The final preparation was free of DNA as measured by spectral analysis and by ethidium bromide staining after native gel electrophoresis.

A peptide containing the PIM-like sequence found in human β-pol (Fig. 2, region II), HQVVEQLQKVHFITDTLSKGE, was obtained. All peptides were from Research Genetics Inc. (Huntsville, AL); purity was found to be greater than 75% by high performance liquid chromatography. Peptides were weighed and dissolved in water at 5–10 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C. The cell lines used were a clone of the wild-type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line Mβ16tsA, a clone of the isogenic β-pol null line Mβ19tsA described previously (16Sobol R.W. Horton J.K.

Cells were routinely grown at 34 °C in a 10% CO2incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with GlutaMAX-1, 10% fetal bovine serum, and hygromycin (80 μg/ml). All cells were routinely tested and found to be free of mycoplasma contamination. The WT, β-pol null, and 19HB3 cells were harvested and washed two times in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer (47Watters D. Khanna K.K. Beamish H. Birrell G. Spring K. Kedar P. Gatei M. Stenzel D. Hobson K. Kozlov S. Zhang N. Farrell A. Ramsay J. Gatti R. Lavin M.

Cells in the lysis buffer were incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatant fraction was transferred to another tube. The protein concentration in the extract was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay, with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. For co-immunoprecipitations, equal amounts (1 mg of protein) of cell lysate were mixed with 0.7 μg of affinity purified anti-β-pol polyclonal antibody or rabbit nonimmune IgG. The mixture was incubated with rotation for 4 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was adsorbed onto protein A-Sepharose and protein G-agarose beads by incubating the mixture overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Finally, the beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, heated for 5 min, and the soluble proteins were separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane in a transblot apparatus for 3 h at 25 V. The membrane was incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T) and eventually probed with the anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody (1:1,000 dilution). Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution) was used as secondary antibody and immobilized horseradish peroxidase activity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). The same blot was stripped by incubating with buffer containing 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C, followed by two washes with TBS-T at room temperature. The presence of β-pol was confirmed by incubating the membrane with mouse anti-β-pol monoclonal antibody 18S (48Srivastava D.K. Evans R.K. Kumar A. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3728-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Similarly, the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-PCNA polyclonal antibody, Ab-5, as described above. The blot was developed with anti-β-pol monoclonal antibody 18S to detect β-pol. After stripping the blot, the presence of PCNA was confirmed using the anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody SC-56. The same method was used for immunoprecipitation and probing with anti-α-pol and anti-FEN-1 antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation of purified PCNA and β-pol was performed in the presence of binding buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). To the mixture of 1.5 μm β-pol and 1.5 μm PCNA in a final volume of 50 μl either anti-β-pol or anti-PCNA antibody were added, and the mixture was incubated with rotation for 4 h at 4 °C. The protein complex was adsorbed onto protein A-Sepharose and protein G-agarose beads by incubating the mixture overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with binding buffer containing protease inhibitors. The beads were suspended in SDS sample buffer, heated for 5 min, and the soluble proteins were separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE. After transferring the proteins to nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane was blocked in 5% milk in TBS-T. Immunoblotting was performed with the appropriate antibody as described above. The β-pol two-hybrid constructs used in this study were prepared from a full-length human β-pol cDNA as a restriction fragment. Adapters were used as needed for in-frame insertion relative to the GAL4 activation domain encoded in the pACT2 yeast two-hybrid vector plasmid (CLONTECH). The β-pol 31-kDa domain construct codes for Arg102 to Glu335 and was prepared by insertion of a Xhol restriction fragment of β-pol. The β-pol-(1–251) construct codes for Met1 to Asp251 and was prepared by insertion of aNcoI-EcoRV restriction fragment of β-pol and contains a vector encoded stop codon. The β-pol-(251–335) construct codes for Asp251 to Glu335 and was prepared by insertion of an EcoRV-XhoI restriction fragment of β-pol. Full-length β-pol and the N-terminal 8-kDa domain were also prepared as in-frame inserts into pACT2. The 8-kDa domain construct codes for Met1 to Arg102. The full-length PCNA two-hybrid construct used in this study was prepared from a full-length human cDNA as a restriction fragment inserted in-frame relative to the GAL4-binding domain in the pAS2-1 yeast two-hybrid vector plasmid (CLONTECH). All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The yeast media used to determine nutritional requirements in the directed two-hybrid selections were prepared following established recipes. Chemical reagents for transformation were obtained from Sigma, and the yeast plasmid vectors and host cells were obtained from CLONTECH. Before testing for protein interactions, each construct was first checked for background Hisexpression on defined medium without histidine. No histidine expression or colony formation were observed for any of the constructs tested, where transformation was always confirmed by reversion to the Trp+ or Leu+ phenotype for the PCNA-binding domain or β-pol activation domain constructs, respectively. Protein interactions were tested by selection for his+revertants following co-transformation of yeast strain CG1945, carrying the his3 and lacZ reporter genes under control of the GAL4 responsive element, with the PCNA-binding domain and β-pol activation domain constructs. Co-transformed cells were plated on dropout medium containing 2.5 mm His3 inhibitor, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, and lacking Trp, Leu, and His (DO3). This was compared with an equal volume of transformants plated on dropout medium lacking Trp and Leu (DO2). The preparation of competent cells and transformations were performed by the LiCl method as described in the Matchmaker GAL4 two-hybrid user manual (CLONTECH PT3061-1). The transformation reactions were split and added in equal amounts to the DO2 and DO3 selection plates, which were grown at 30 °C and photographed after 5 days. All protein interactions detected by nutritional selection were confirmed by β-galactosidase assays performed using the Gal-ScreenTM protocol with detection on a TR717TM Microplate Luminometer (Applera Corp.). The overlay protein binding assay was performed as described previously (49Shi J. Sugrue S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14910-14915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified β-pol (24 μg) was digested with trypsin (substrate to trypsin ratio, 10:1, w/w) in a final volume of 105 μl in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA (44Kumar A.

Aliquots were withdrawn at 0, 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min, mixed with SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk at 4 °C for 16 h. Membranes were then incubated at room temperature for 4 h in the same buffer with 0.1 μm PCNA, either with or without competing peptide, with buffer alone, or with IgG as a control (in a buffer containing protease inhibitors and 0.1% Tween 20, 1% BSA, and 0.5% Triton X-100). After incubation, the membrane was washed five times with the same buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody diluted 1:1000 in TBS-T. Blots were incubated in 5% normal goat serum in TBS prior to secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:10,000) incubation, followed by ECL. Equimolar amounts (1.5 μm) of β-pol and PCNA were incubated in binding buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and the protease inhibitors) in a final volume of 50 μl. A suspension of SP-Sepharose (30 μl) pre-equilibrated with binding buffer was added and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating shaker. Increasing amounts of peptide II or jumbled peptide were added to the incubation mixture as indicated in the figure legends. Protein-bound Sepharose beads were washed three times with binding buffer; SDS sample buffer was added, the mixture was heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and soluble proteins were resolved by 4–12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and the blots were developed as described above. The mutant β-pol (H222A/F223A) expression construct was prepared with the assistance of Dr. T. G. Wood, University of Texas Medical Branch, as described (50Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R.

The β-pol mutant protein was overexpressed and purified, as described (42Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A partial BER reaction was reconstituted with purified proteins under the following conditions: the reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml BSA, 4 mm ATP, 250 nm 34-base pair DNA substrate with a uracil residue at position 16, 20 μm each of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 2.3 μm [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity: 1 × 106 dpm/pmol). Uracil-containing DNA substrate was pretreated with uracil-DNA glycosylase as described previously (30Prasad R. Lavrik O.I. Kim S.J. Kedar P. Yang X.P. Vande Berg B.J. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32411-32414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was assembled on ice by mixing 10 nmAPE and 2.5 nm wild-type β-pol or H222A/F223A mutant β-pol. Incubation was for 20 min at 37 °C and was within a linear range for product formation as a function of time and enzyme concentration. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described previously (30Prasad R. Lavrik O.I. Kim S.J. Kedar P. Yang X.P. Vande Berg B.J. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32411-32414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Because PCNA is involved in many DNA repair functions, we considered it to be a candidate for interaction with β-pol. To explore this possibility, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-β-pol antibody and extracts from WT and β-pol null mouse cells and also with extract from null cells (19HB3) stably transfected with a β-pol expression vector. With WT cell extract the anti-β-pol antibody immunoprecipitated PCNA (Fig 1A, panel 1, lanes 2 and 3). A protein of similar size was not detected in the immunoprecipitate prepared with preimmune IgG and WT extract (Fig.1A, panel 1, lane 1) or with immunoprecipitates of β-pol null cell extract prepared with anti-β-pol antibody (Fig. 1A, panel 1, lanes 4 and 5). Extract of null cells supplemented with purified β-pol or extract from null cells stably transfected with a β-pol expression vector also showed immunoprecipitation of PCNA (Fig.1A, lanes 7 and 8).

Previous studies have provided evidence that the SMN complex functions in the assembly/restructuring of spliceosomal snRNPs and in pre-mRNA splicing and transcription (17Buhler D. Raker V.

The SMN complex may also play a role in the metabolism of small nucleolar RNPs involved in the processing and modification of ribosomal RNA (19Pellizzoni L. Baccon J. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1079-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20Jones K.W. Gorzynski K. Hales C.M. Fischer U. Badbanchi F. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. J. Biol.

The determination of the full complement of components of the SMN complex and its substrates will facilitate the mechanistic analysis of the activities of the SMN complex. A thorough knowledge of how this macromolecular machine participates in the assembly and function of several RNP complexes should lead to an understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of SMA. To identify all of the components of the SMN complex and to characterize its biochemical, structural, and functional properties, we developed a system for the purification of native SMN complexes from HeLa cells (14Pellizzoni L. Baccon J. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7540-7545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). From these purified SMN complexes, novel proteins were identified by peptide microsequencing by mass spectrometry. Here, we characterize what is apparently the last of the components of the SMN complex, termed Gemin7. We show that Gemin7 associates in vivo with the SMN complex and is present in gems. These features are characteristic of the SMN complex components. Gemin7 interacts directly with Gemin6 and SMN in vitro and bridges the interaction between Gemin6 and SMN. The evolutionarily conserved YG box of SMN is important for efficient interaction with Gemin7. Additionally, Gemin7 associates with a unique subset of Sm proteins. Interestingly, Gemin7 is the first integral component of the SMN complex found to contain RG repeats. The amino terminus of Gemin7 containing these RG repeats is necessary but not sufficient for the interaction between Gemin7 and SMN. The SMN complex was purified from HeLa Tet-ON cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged Gemin2 under an inducible promoter as described previously (14Pellizzoni L. Baccon J. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7540-7545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Washes in RSB-500 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl) containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40 were performed prior to elution from the anti-FLAG affinity resin using a low pH elution buffer (Sigma). The purified complex was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Bands were excised from a single one-dimensional or two-dimensional silver-stained polyacrylamide gel and in gel digested with trypsin as described previously (37Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7785) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides in the supernatant were analyzed by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry as described previously (38Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar) using a QSTAR (MDS Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (MDS Proteomics, Odense, Denmark). Comprehensive protein and expressed sequence tag databases were searched using the protein and peptide software suite (MDS Proteomics). No limitations on protein molecular weight and species of origin were imposed. The cDNA corresponding to Gemin7 was generated by PCR amplification from the Marathon-Ready cDNA library (CLONTECH). The insert was cloned downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter into a modified pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) containing either the myc-tag or the FLAG-tag sequences at the amino terminus. Gemin7 wild-type (wt) and the deletion of the amino-terminal 32 amino acids (ΔN32) were cloned into the pet28 vector (Novagen) to obtain the amino-terminal His-tagged fusion. Gemin6 and Gemin7 were cloned into a petGST-TEV vector to obtain the amino-terminal GST fusion containing a TEV protease site upstream of the cDNA insert. The constructs formyc-tagged SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, Gemin4, Gemin6, his-tagged SMN wild type and mutants, FLAG-tagged Gemin2, V5-tagged Gemin5, GST-tagged Gemin6, his-tagged Gemin6, and myc-tagged Sm proteins were described previously (10Liu Q.

HeLa PV or 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected by the standard calcium phosphate method. Following overnight incubation with DNA, cells were washed, and fresh medium was added. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed from 293T total cell extracts followed by Western blotting as described previously (39Pinol-Roma S. Choi Y.D. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). HeLa PV cells plated on glass coverslips were briefly washed with PBS, fixed in 2% formaldehyde-PBS for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100-PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Double-label immunofluorescence experiments were performed by separate sequential incubations of each primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin followed by the specific secondary coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate or TRITC. All of the incubations were at room temperature for 1 h. Indirect epifluorescence microscopy was performed with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope. Digital images were collected with a Cook Sensicam high performance camera and processed with the IP lab software. Recombinant GST, GST-Gemin6, and GST-Gemin7 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coliBL21 (DE3) and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-TEV-Gemin6 was coexpressed with either His-tagged Gemin7 wt or ΔN32 and purified in the same manner.In vitro binding experiments were carried out using purified recombinant proteins (5 μg) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the indicated proteins translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (16Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). His-Gemin7 was translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine + [35S]cysteine. Direct in vitro binding experiments were carried out using 2 μg of purified recombinant His-tagged SMN wild-type and mutants or Gemin6 proteins. We have previously described a system that is suitable for the purification of native SMN complexes containing all of the core components from cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged SMN or Gemin2 (14Pellizzoni L. Baccon J. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7540-7545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Here, we purified the SMN complex from FLAG-Gemin2 extracts using anti-FLAG affinity resin and high stringency salt washes. The purified SMN complex was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining along with nonspecific proteins purified from extracts of the parental HeLa Tet-ON cell line as a comparison (Fig.1). Using this purification scheme, the integral SMN complex components remain associated, whereas other SMN interactors including the Sm proteins are either barely detectable or completely absent. An analysis by peptide sequencing of these purified SMN complexes has led to the identification of novel proteins including Gemin6 and a 15-kDa protein (14Pellizzoni L. Baccon J. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7540-7545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Here, we present the characterization of the 15-kDa protein component of the SMN complex, which we term Gemin7, previously indicated as SIP3 (Fig. 1) (10Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

The band corresponding to this protein was excised from the gel and digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were sequenced by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A peptide sequence (RRAPLRPEVPEIQECPIAQESLESQEQR) was obtained that exactly matched several expressed sequence tag sequences in the data base, and the corresponding cDNA was cloned by PCR amplification from a cDNA library. Gemin7 cDNA contains both start and stop codons, and an in-frame stop codon is present upstream of the initial methionine indicating that the cDNA represents the full-length transcript. Gemin7 cDNA encodes a protein of 131 amino acids of predicted molecular mass (14.5 kDa) and isoelectric point (pI = 7.27) that is consistent with the size and the pI of the protein eluted and analyzed by mass spectrometry (Fig.2) (see also Ref. 14Pellizzoni L.

Data base searches identified a putative murine ortholog of Gemin7 (identity 82%, BAB26836). The alignment of the human and mouse Gemin7 is presented in Fig. 2.

Gemin7 does not contain any known motifs that may suggest possible functions; however, it does contain several arginine and glycine residues, two RG pairs and one Gly-Arg-Arg, at the amino terminus.FIG. 2Alignment of Gemin7 protein sequences.Protein sequences corresponding to human Gemin7 (GenBankTM accession number AY114106) and its putative mouse ortholog (GenBankTM accession number BAB26836) were aligned using ClustalW alignment of the MacVector 6.5 program.Dark gray boxes indicate identical amino acids; light gray boxes indicate similar amino acids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The observation that Gemin7 copurifies with SMN under highly stringent conditions indicates that it is a bona fide component of the SMN complex. To confirm this observation, we transiently transfected 293T cells with a vector encoding a FLAG-tagged Gemin7 fusion protein (Gemin7) or with an empty vector as a control (mock). Immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibodies was performed on total extracts, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Fig. 3 shows that FLAG-Gemin7 is expressed and immunoprecipitated efficiently by anti-FLAG antibodies. All of the components of the SMN complex, SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, Gemin4, Gemin5, and Gemin6, coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG- Gemin7. In contrast, the abundant protein hnRNPA1 is not immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Gemin7, indicating that the immunoprecipitation is specific. None of the SMN complex components is immunoprecipitated from a control extract that does not express Gemin7. These results demonstrate that Gemin7 is a novel component of the SMN complex. SMN localizes in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus where it is highly concentrated in gems (15Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3555-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Gems are nuclear bodies that are similar in size and number to CBs and can be found, depending on the cell type or tissue analyzed, either separated or associated with them (15Liu Q. Dreyfuss G.

All of the components of the SMN complex including Gemin2, Gemin3, Gemin4, Gemin5, and Gemin6 have an identical subcellular localization to that of SMN (10Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

In contrast, most of the substrates of the SMN complex such as snRNP and small nucleolar RNP proteins localize elsewhere in the cells including CBs but not gems when these structures are found separated (15Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3555-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). We examined the subcellular localization of Gemin7 by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy on HeLa PV cells transiently transfected with Myc-tagged Gemin7. In this cell line, gems and CBs are found mostly separated (15Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3555-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Fig. 4Ashows that in addition to diffuse cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic distribution, Gemin7 localizes to discrete nuclear domains. To distinguish between gems and CBs, we carried out double labeling experiments with anti-SMN and anti-coilin antibodies. The Gemin7 colocalizes perfectly with SMN in gems (Fig. 4, A–C) but not with coilin (Fig. 4, D–F), the marker of CBs (40Andrade L.E. Tan E.M. Chan E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1947-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Importantly, Gemin7 staining without coilin can be observed in transfected cells. We conclude that Gemin7 is a novel component of the SMN complex and colocalizes with other components of the SMN complex in gems. We further studied the interactions of Gemin7 in vitro with the other known components of the SMN complex using SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, Gemin4, Gemin5, Gemin6, and Gemin7 in vitro translated proteins (Fig. 5A). GST-Gemin7 binds efficiently to in vitro translated Gemin6 but not to any of the other complex components. No binding to GST was observed (data not shown). The interaction of Gemin7 with Gemin6 is direct as demonstrated by in vitro binding between purified recombinant proteins. His-tagged Gemin6 (His-Gemin6) binds efficiently to GST-Gemin7 but does not bind to GST-Gemin6 or to GST alone (Fig. 5B). Upon longer exposure of the gel in Fig. 5A, a weak interaction between Gemin7 and SMN could be detected. Therefore, we tested this interaction using purified recombinant proteins. Purified His-tagged SMN binds directly and efficiently to GST-Gemin7 but not to GST-Gemin6 or GST (Fig. 5C). These experiments demonstrate that Gemin7 binds directly to both SMN and Gemin6. Next, we tested whether Gemin7 can interact simultaneously with both Gemin6 and SMN. For these direct binding experiments, GST-Gemin6 was expressed alone or coexpressed with His-tagged Gemin7 wt or Gemin7 ΔN32. Both the wt and ΔN32 proteins copurified efficiently with Gemin6, indicating that the RG domain of Gemin7 is not necessary for the interaction with Gemin6 (Fig. 5D, lanes 4 and 5, lower panel). GST alone (lane 2) and GST-Gemin6 (lane 3) do not interact with His-tagged SMN, whereas the GST-Gemin6/His-Gemin7 protein complex interacts efficiently and directly with purified recombinant His-SMN (lane 4). This efficient interaction with SMN is impaired when Gemin7 ΔN32 is used for binding (lane 5). These results demonstrate that Gemin7 is required for the interaction of Gemin6 with the SMN complex, serving as a bridge to SMN, and that the RG-containing region of Gemin7 is necessary for efficient interaction with SMN. We then tested the RG domain alone of Gemin7 comprising amino acids 1–32 for binding to SMN and found that this region is not sufficient for the Gemin7 interaction with SMN (data not shown). Thus, the RG-rich region of Gemin7 is necessary but not sufficient for direct interaction between Gemin7 and SMN. SmB, SmD1, and SmD3 also require their RG domains for interaction with SMN (18Friesen W.J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26370-26375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, arginine residues within the RG domains of these Sm proteins are symmetrically dimethylated in vivo, and this modification enhances the binding to SMN (26Brahms H. Meheus L. de Brabandere V. Fischer U. Luhrmann R. RNA. 2001; 7: 1531-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 27Brahms H. Raymackers J. Union A. de Keyser F. Meheus L. Luhrmann R. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether Gemin7 receives a similar modification in vivo. To identify the region of SMN necessary for its interaction with Gemin7, we tested a panel of recombinantly produced His-tagged SMN wild-type and deletion mutant proteins in direct in vitro binding experiments. Recombinant GST-Gemin7 or GST as a control was incubated with SMN wild-type or SMN deleted of the amino-terminal 51 amino acids (ΔN51), the Tudor domain, encoded by the sequence of Exon3 (ΔEx3), the YG box (ΔYG), or the amino acids encoded by Exon7 (ΔEx7) (Fig. 6). The deletion of the evolutionarily conserved YG box of SMN impaired Gemin7 binding, whereas all of the other deletion mutants efficiently interacted with Gemin7. Therefore, both the Gemin2 binding domain encoded by Exon1/2A (10Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and the Tudor domain are dispensable for SMN interaction with Gemin7. In contrast, the evolutionarily conserved YG box, which is important for SMN oligomerization and interaction with RG-containing protein targets (6Paushkin S. Charroux B. Abel L. Perkinson R.A.

We next investigated the interactions of Gemin7 with the Sm proteins of spliceosomal snRNPs, the best characterized substrates of the SMN complex (10Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled Sm proteins were incubated with purified recombinant GST-Gemin7 or GST as a control. As shown in Fig. 7, Gemin7 interacts strongly with SmE and to a lesser extent with SmB, SmD2, and SmD3. None of the Sm proteins interacts with GST alone. These experiments demonstrate that Gemin7 interacts with a specific subset of Sm proteins. Gemin7 interacts most avidly with SmE, demonstrating a different Sm binding pattern as compared with the other components of the SMN complex. Specifically, SMN interacts avidly with the symmetrically dimethylated arginines of the carboxyl-terminal RG tails of SmD1 and SmD3 and with SmB (16Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl.

These interactions provide further evidence for multiple contacts between individual Sm proteins and components of the SMN complex that are likely to be important for the function of the SMN complex in snRNP core assembly. From our analysis of the purified SMN complex, it appears that with Gemin7 the inventory of the integral constituents of the SMN complex is or is close to being complete. In Fig.8 we present an overall scheme depicting the SMN complex based on the known composition and interactions among components. For simplicity of presentation, the complex is presented as a dimer, although it forms higher order oligomers in vivo(10Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

The stoichiometry of the individual components is unknown; however, the individual interactions within the complex have been delineated. SMN interacts directly with Gemin2, Gemin3, Gemin5, and Gemin7 (Fig. 5C) (10Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

One-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR spectra were used to demonstrate that LM and LAM from M. chelonae, designated CheLM and CheLAM, respectively, possess structures that differ from the ones reported earlier in other mycobacterial species. Analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry of the phosphatidyl-myo-inositol anchor, which is thought to play a role in the biological functions of these lipoglycans, pointed to a high degree of heterogeneity based on numerous combinations of acyl groups on the C-1 and C-2 positions of the glycerol moiety.

Infection and immunopathogenesis of these diseases widely implicate the mycobacterial cell wall (1Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which is abundantly composed of mannoconjugates, notably polysaccharides and lipoglycans. The latter consist mainly of phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIMs),1 lipomannan (LM), and the structurally related lipoarabinomannan (LAM). LAM is a major cell wall component and is considered as a modulin through its various immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, which favor the survival of the mycobacteria within the infected host. These effects include suppression of T lymphocyte proliferation through interference with antigen processing (2Moreno C. Mehlert A. Lamb J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1988; 74: 206-210PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of macrophage activation by interferon-γ (3Sibley L.D. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Krahenbuhl J.L. Infect.

LAM is not only a virulence factor responsible for macrophage deactivation, but it is also implicated in phagocytosis of mycobacteria into phagocytic cells (6Schlesinger L.S. Hull S.R. Kaufman T.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4070-4079PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, PIMs that are believed to be precursors of LM and LAM have recently been proposed to recruit NK T cells, which play a primary role in the granulomatous response (7Apostolou I.

The biosynthetic relationship of phosphatidylinositol (PI), PIMs, LM, and LAM has recently been supported by biochemical (9Khoo K.H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D.

However, the structures of LAM from several species including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, and Mycobacterium smegmatis have been extensively described during the last decade. LAM is a complex glycolipid composed ofd-mannan and d-arabinan attached to a PI moiety that anchors the glycolipid in the mycobacterial cell wall (13Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9272-9279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of LAM involves the addition of mannopyranosyl (Manp) residues to PI to produce both the short PIMs (2–5 Man residues) and LM, which is further glycosylated with arabinan to form LAM (9Khoo K.H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. J. Biol.

In all the species described so far,d-mannan consists of a highly branched structure with an α1,6-linked Manp backbone substituted at C-2 by single Manp units (16Chatterjee D. Hunter S.W. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6228-6233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mannan size and the degree of branching can vary depending on the species. The arabinan consists of a linear α1,5-linked arabinofuranosyl (Araf) backbone punctuated by branching produced with 3,5-O-linked α-d-Araf residue. The lateral chains are organized either as linear tetra-arabinofuranosides β-d-Araf-(1,2)-α-d-Araf-(1,5)-α-d-Araf-(1, 5)-α-d-Araf or as a biantennary hexa-arabinofuranosides [β-d-Araf-(1,2)-α-d-Araf-(1-]2-3 and 5)-α-d-Araf-(1,5)-α-d-Araf(17Chatterjee D.

Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Comparative analyses of LAMs from different mycobacterial species have shown that the non-reducing termini of the arabinosyl side chains are differentially modified. M. tuberculosis and M. leprae modify the termini with Manp residues, thereby yielding “ManLAM,” whereas the rapidly growing speciesM. smegmatis uses inositol phosphate, generating “AraLAM” (19Khoo K.H.

It is thought that these modifications are responsible for the marked differences in the biological activities of ManLAM and AraLAM (15Chatterjee D. Lowell K. Rivoire B. McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. J.

However, as mentioned above, all available LAM structures are derived from a very limited panel of mycobacterial species, and whether these structures are invariably present in most species remains to be investigated. Awareness that subtle differences among LAMs may affect their biological properties prompted us to establish the structure of LM/LAM fromMycobacterium chelonae, a rapidly growing pathogenic mycobacterium that is found in soil and fresh water throughout the world (21Wolinsky E. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1979; 119: 107-159PubMed Google Scholar). M. chelonae infection typically causes localized skin lesions, often following penetrating trauma or injections. Disseminated disease usually occurs in patients with a significant immune compromised state that is most commonly attributable to exogenous steroid use (22Wallace Jr., R.J. Brown B.A. Onyi G.O. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 166: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 23Ingram C.W. Tanner D.C. Durack D.T. Kernodle Jr., G.W. Corey G.R. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1993; 16: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We report here the detailed structure of LM/LAM from M. chelonae and provide evidence for important differences such as the acylation composition of the PI, branching of the mannan core, and the absence of Manp and inositol phosphate caps. Because these structures were found to be unique among a panel of various mycobacterial species, we propose to designate these components as CheLM and CheLAM. All mycobacterial species used were grown on plates containing Middlebrook 7H11 agar supplemented with 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment (Difco) or in liquid Sauton medium. Except for M. chelonae (ATCC 19536), which was grown under shaking in Sauton medium at 30 °C for several days, all other species were grown at 37 °C. Confirmation of the identity of the M. chelonae strain was done by analyzing its mycolic acid profile, which is rather unusual because it consists of 60% of α-mycolates and 40% of α′-mycolates (24Kremer L. Dover L. Carrère S. Nampoothiri M. Lesjean S. Brown A. Brennan P.J. Minnikin D.E. Locht C. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25Minnikin D.E. Minnikin S.M. Goodfellow M. Stanford J.L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1982; 128: 817-822PubMed Google Scholar). Extraction of CheLM and CheLAM was adapted from Nigou et al. (26Nigou J. Gilleron M. Cahuzac B.

Briefly, cells were harvested, washed in PBS (20 mm K2HPO4 (pH 7.5), 0.15m NaCl), and resuspended in lysis buffer (8% (v/v) Triton X-114 in PBS, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mmMgCl2). Cells were then heat-inactivated, disrupted using a French pressure cell and stirred overnight at 4 °C. Cellular debris were removed by centrifugation (27,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and phase separation was induced at 37 °C. Lipoglycans present in the lower phase were precipitated by adding 5 volumes of cold ethanol and collected by centrifugation (27,000 ×g, 30 min, 4 °C). The pellet was dissolved in water, and proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml for 20 min at 55 °C. Proteins were extracted twice by adding saturated phenol. Combined aqueous phases containing lipoglycans were dialyzed for 72 h against water, lyophilized, and resuspended in Tris deoxycholate buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholate). CheLAM and CheLM were then separated by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Biosciences) column (80 × 1.5 cm) in the same buffer. The eluted fractions were monitored by 13% SDS-PAGE stained for carbohydrates according to Tsai and Frasch (27Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar). The appropriate LAM and LM fractions were pooled and dialyzed for 48 h against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and then for 48 h against water prior to lyophilization. The endotoxin content of all reagents was measured in a chromogenic Limulus lysate assay (BioWhittaker). The LAM preparations contained insignificant amounts of endotoxin (<25 pg/ml) Prior to NMR spectroscopic analysis, LM (15 mg) and LAM (5 mg) were repeatedly exchanged in2H2O (99.97% purity, Euriso-top, CEA Saclay, France) with intermediate freeze-drying and then dissolved in 250 μl of Me2SO-d6 (Euriso-top). Chemical shifts were expressed in ppm downfield from the signal of the methyl group of Me2SO-d6(δ1H/TMS = 2.52 ppm, δ13C/TMS = 40.98 ppm at 343 K). The samples were analyzed in 200 × 5 mm BMS-005-B Shigemi® tubes on a Bruker ASX-400 spectrometer (Centre d'Analyses RMN, Villeneuve d'Ascq) (1H, 400.33;13C, 100.66, 31P, 162.5 MHz) equipped with a double resonance (1H/X) Broad Band Inverse z-gradient probe head. All NMR data were recorded without sample spinning. The one-dimensional proton 1H spectrum was measured using 90° tipping angle for the pulse and 1.5 s as a recycle delay between each of 32 acquisitions of 2.4 s. The spectral width of 4006 Hz was collected in 16,384 complex data points. The one-dimensional 13C was recorded using a spectral width of 20,161 Hz, and 32,768 data points were collected to obtain a free induction decay resolution of 0.6 Hz per point. The31P spectra of both compounds were acquired with a spectral width of 16,233 Hz collected in 16,384 data points. Both experiments were recorded using a composite pulse decoupling during acquisition using globally optimized alternating phase sequence at the carbon or phosphorus frequency (28Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar). An exponential transformation (line broadening factor = 5 for 13C and 3 Hz for31P) was applied prior to processing data points in the frequency domain. Two-dimensional homonuclear (1H-1H) spectra (COSY-ROESY-TOCSY) were measured using standard Bruker pulse programs. ROESY spectra were acquired with various mixing times (50, 100, 200, and 400 ms) and acquired in States mode according to Bax and Davis (29Bax A.D. Davis J. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 63: 207-213Google Scholar), whereas both COSY and relayed COSY were acquired in the magnitude calculation mode. Moreover, the two-dimensional TOCSY spectrum was recorded using a MLEV-17 mixing sequence of 120 ms. The spin lock field strength corresponded to a 90° pulse width of 35 μs. The spectral width was 4000 Hz in both dimensions. 512 spectra of 4096 data points with 32 scans per t1 increment were recorded giving a spectral resolution of 0.9 Hz/point in F2 and ∼8 Hz/point in F1. Heteronuclear experiments (1H-13C and1H-31P) were obtained with standard Bruker pulse sequences such as HMQC (inv4tp), HMQC-HOHAHA (inv4mltp), and HMBC (inv4lrnd). HMQC and HMQC-HOHAHA were acquired in the phase-sensitive increment time proportional phase increment (TPPI) method, whereas HMBC was recorded in magnitude mode calculation. All parameters (pulse widths, pulse powers, and delays) were optimized for each experiment. Acquisitions and processing conditions are expressed in the figure legends. Monosaccharides were analyzed as alditol-acetate derivatives. Lipoglycans were hydrolyzed in 4n trifluoroacetic acid for 4 h at 100 °C and reduced with NaBH4 in 0.05 n NH4OH for 4 h. Reduction was stopped by dropwise addition of acetic acid until the pH reached 6, and borate salts were co-distilled by repetitive evaporation in dry methanol. Per-acetylation was performed in acetic anhydride at 100 °C for 2 h, and derivatives were analyzed in GC on a BPX70 12 m × 0.22 mm ID column (Chrompak). For exact quantification of glycerol and myo-inositol, 100 μg of lipoglycans along with 1 μg of scyllo-inositol, as an internal standard, were hydrolyzed with 6 n hydrochloric acid constant boiling (Pierce), at 110 °C for 24 h, and analyzed as TMS derivatives (30Kamerling J.P. Gerwig G.J. Vliegenthart J.F. Clamp J.R. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) using GC on a DB-1 60 m ×0.25 mm inner diameter by on-column injection. Linkage analyses of monosaccharides was achieved by two steps of per-methylation according to Ciucanu and Kerek (31Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3205) Google Scholar) and followed by derivatization with acetyl groups with acetic anhydride. Acylglycerols were analyzed according to Nigou et al. (26Nigou J. Gilleron M. Cahuzac B. Bounéri J.D. Herold M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23094-23103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) after cleavage of the phosphodiester bond by acetolysis. Briefly, 100 μg of lipoglycans were treated with 400 μl of anhydrous acetic acid/acetic anhydride, 3:2 (v/v), at 110 °C for 12 h. Acetylated acylglycerols were extracted by cyclohexane and analyzed by GC/MS on a WCOT fused silica 30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter column (Chrompak). Fatty acids were analyzed from intact lipoglycans as well as from extracted acetylated acylglycerol as pyrrolidine derivatives. They were released by methyl esterification with 0.5 m HCl in anhydrous methanol at 80 °C for 20 h, extracted with heptane, and derivatized with 200 μl of pyrrolidine/acetic acid, 9:1 (v/v), at 80 °C for 2 h. Pyrrolidine-derivatized fatty acids were repetitively extracted by CHCl3/H3O, 1:1 (v/v), and analyzed by GC/MS on a WCOT fused silica 30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter column (Chrompak). The molecular mass of the lipoglycans was measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization on a Vision 2000 time-of-flight instrument (Finnigan Mat) equipped with a 337-nm UV laser. Samples were dissolved in water at a concentration of 100 pmol/μl. One μl of the solution was mixed with an equal volume of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 mg/ml; dissolved in water/methanol, 4:1 (v/v)) matrix solution on the target and then allowed to crystallize at room temperature. Western blot analyses were conducted either on purified LMs and LAMs or on crude mycobacterial lysates. For purified LM and LAM samples, the sugar content was estimated by GC, and the equivalent of 0.5 μg of mannose for each sample was analyzed by 13% SDS-PAGE. For crude lysates, mycobacterial cells were harvested, resuspended in 0.8 ml of PBS, and disrupted for 10 min with a Branson Sonifier 450. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of proteins (30 μg) were then separated by 13% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a Hybond-C Extra membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were then saturated with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and probed overnight with either ConA-DIG or GNA-DIG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, dilution 1:1000). After washing, membranes were subsequently incubated with anti-DIG antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 1:1000 dilution). The human promonocytic THP-1 cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 2 10−5m β-mercaptoethanol in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. THP-1 cells were induced to express CD14 by treatment with 50 nm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Calbiochem) for 48 h. Cells were then washed twice with RPMI 1640 and cultured in 96-well plastic culture plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and glutamine. The purified molecules LAMs from M. Chelonae, M. tuberculosisErdman, and M. smegmatis were added at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, and triplicates were performed in order to measure cytokine release. Culture supernatants were collected after 6 or 24 h for TNF-α or IL-8 production, respectively. Specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays commercial kits were used according the manufacturer's instructions. Human IL-8 and TNF-α kits were purchased from Bender Med systems Diagnostic and R & D Systems, respectively. Cytokine production was quantified with a microtiter plate reader in comparison with a standard curve generated with recombinant human cytokines. The experimental protocols used to extract LM and LAM fromM. chelonae are based on successive detergent and phenol extractions, leading to the recovery of nucleic acid-, protein-, and lipid-free materials. Purity of the preparation was assessed by GC/MS and SDS-PAGE. CheLAM and CheLM were finally resolved on a gel permeation S200 column. Fig.1a represents the elution profile of each compound and shows that CheLM was present in higher amounts than CheLAM. This was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis of the total Triton X-114 extract (Fig. 1b). The CheLM/CheLAM ratio (w/w) was also determined by routine monosaccharide analysis and revealed that CheLM was three times as abundant as CheLAM. This result was found for several independent extractions (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the relative abundance of these two compounds largely differs from the ones reported previously for other mycobacterial species, in which LAM represents the major component. For instance, an approximate LM/LAM ratio (w/w) of 1:2.5 was found inM. bovis BCG (26Nigou J. Gilleron M. Cahuzac B. Bounéri J.D. Herold M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23094-23103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) compared with the 3:1 ratio observed inM. chelonae. Because LM is thought to be a biosynthetic precursor of LAM, we first undertook the structural elucidation of LM, and we subsequently determined the structure of the more complex LAM molecule. The molecular weight of CheLM was investigated by MALDI analysis. It showed a broad unresolved peak centered at 6900 Da (data not shown). Quantitative analysis of the alditol-acetate derivatives of CheLM led to an average composition of 35 mannose, 1 arabinose, and 1 myo-inositol residues. The exact quantification of TMS derivatives by GC using on-column injection demonstrated the presence of 1.07 unit of glycerol per molecule ofmyo-inositol, which establishes the ratio of mannose/arabinose/inositol/glycerol as 35:1:1:1. Analysis of partially methylated alditol-acetate derivatives revealed the presence of three major components (Table I) identified on the basis of their retention times and fragmentation patterns as t-Manp, 6-Manp, and 3,6-Manp. Another product, different from a mannitol-acetate, was characterized by (M + NH4)+ at m/z 338, indicative of a di-acetylated, tetra-methylated inositol. EI/MS fragments at m/z 200, 191, and 75 identified this compound as a 2,6-Ac2-1,3,4,5-Me4-Ins, which is in agreement with an earlier published report (16Chatterjee D. Hunter S.W. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6228-6233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An (M + NH4)+ ion at m/z 366 corresponding to a tri-acetylated, tri-methylated inositol was detected as a minor component. However, because its fragmentation pattern was unclear, the detailed structure of this product was not analyzed further.Table IMethylation analysis of CheLM and CheLAMProposed structuremol (%)CheLMCheLAMt-Ara13.52-Ara6.25-Ara45.83,5-Ara14.3t-Man52.79.96-Man16.64.73,6-Man30.75.6 Open table in a new tab In order to establish the main features of both the polysaccharide and the putative GPI anchor of LM from M. chelonae, an exhaustive NMR-based study was conducted. NMR experiments were recorded successively in D2O and in Me2SO. As shown previously (26Nigou J. Gilleron M. Cahuzac B. Bounéri J.D. Herold M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23094-23103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), an improved resolution was obtained in Me2SO, which was used for most experiments. 1H and 13C NMR parameters of the polysaccharide moiety from CheLM were assigned using one-dimensional 1H and 13C experiments as well as two-dimensional 1H-1H homonuclear and two-dimensional 1H-13C and1H-31P heteronuclear experiments.

Open table in a new tab The anomeric proton region is dominated by two signals at δ 4.94 and δ 4.71 ppm (Fig. 2a). The former signal correlates in the COSY 90 experiment with a single H-2 signal at δ 3.84 ppm, whereas the other correlates with two largely distinct H-2 signals at δ 3.94 ppm and δ 3.68 ppm (Fig.2d), suggesting the presence of two anomeric protons of distinct origins at δ 4.71 ppm. The configuration of these three spin systems was unambiguously attributed to Manp in accordance with TOCSY and NOESY experiments. Moreover, the magnitude of the1JH1,C1 coupling constant, 168–170 Hz, provided evidence for the α-anomeric configuration of these mannose units. This observation was confirmed by the presence of an intra-residual H-1/H-2 NOE contact (data not shown). Based on the complete assignment of its 1H and13C NMR parameters and according to the published literature (14Venisse A. Berjeaud J.M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gilleron M. Bala L. Brando T. Vercellone A. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 677-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the mannose unit deriving from the anomeric proton at δ 4.94 was typified as a terminal α-Manp(IV). The signal at δ 4.71 ppm correlated with a single C-1 signal at δ 100.7 ppm and was tentatively assigned to the anomeric protons of the 6-O-substituted and 3,6-O-substituted mannose units previously observed through methylation analysis. Because of the1H-13C HMQC (Fig. 2b), HMQC-HOHAHA (data not shown), COSY and HMBC experiments (Fig. 2a), all the carbon parameters of these two units could be assigned. In particular, two distinct C-3 signals were identified, one at δ 72 ppm corresponding to an unsubstituted C-3, and one deshielded at δ 80.3 ppm indicative of a substituted C-3. On the other hand, a single deshielded C-6 resonance at δ 66.6 ppm, and a single slightly shielded C-5 resonance at δ 72.42 ppm could also be observed. These parameters confirm that the two mannosyl units are 6-O-substituted and 3,6-O-substituted. Altogether, these NMR data support the fact that the major1H signal at δ 4.71 corresponds to the anomeric proton of both 6- and 3,6-substituted"
https://openalex.org/W2021100900,"Agonist binding to the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) induces the phosphorylation of four distinct serine residues that are located in the CCR5 C terminus. We established a series of clonal RBL-2H3 cell lines expressing CCR5 with alanine mutations of Ser336, Ser337, Ser342, and Ser349 in various combinations and explored the significance of phosphorylation sites for the ability of the receptor to interact with β-arrestins and to undergo desensitization and internalization upon ligand binding. Receptor mutants that lack any two phosphorylation sites retained their ability to recruit endogenous β-arrestins to the cell membrane and were normally sequestered, whereas alanine mutation of any three C-terminal serine residues abolished both β-arrestin binding and rapid agonist-induced internalization. In contrast, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) stimulation of a S336A/S349A mutant triggered a sustained calcium response and enhanced granular enzyme release. This mutational analysis implies that CCR5 internalization largely depends on a β-arrestin-mediated mechanism that requires the presence of any two phosphorylation sites, whereas receptor desensitization is independently regulated by the phosphorylation of distinct serine residues. Surface plasmon resonance analysis further demonstrated that purified β-arrestin 1 binds to phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated C-tail peptides with similar affinities, suggesting that β-arrestins use additional receptor sites to discriminate between nonactivated and activated receptors. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed β-arrestin 1 binding to the second intracellular loop of CCR5, which required an intact Asp-Arg-Tyr triplet. These results suggest that a conserved sequence motif within the second intracellular loop of CCR5 that is known to be involved in G protein activation plays a significant role in β-arrestin binding to CCR5.

CC chemokine receptor 5 G protein-coupled receptor GPCR kinase human embryonic kidney released on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (also known as CCL5) surface plasmon resonance human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid high pressure liquid chromatography intracellular loop carboxyl terminus The CC chemokine receptor CCR51 is a member of the large family of heptahelical receptors that transduce extracellular signals into the cell by activating heterotrimeric G proteins. CCR5 is expressed, among other cells, on memory T lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (1Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176PubMed Google Scholar). Physiological ligands that bind to this receptor with high affinity include the CC chemokines RANTES, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and MCP-2 and a proteolytically processed variant of HCC-1. CCR5 is also the principal co-receptor for macrophage-tropic (or R5) strains of HIV-1 (2Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Individuals homozygous for a nonfunctionalCCR5Δ32 allele express a truncated receptor that fails to reach the cell surface and are thus highly resistant to HIV infection. Chemokines and small molecule receptor antagonists inhibit HIV-1 infection in vitro by blocking the binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 to CCR5. Another mechanism that underlies the pronounced antiviral effect of certain chemokines and their derivatives relates to their ability to effectively down-modulate CCR5 expression by inducing receptor endocytosis and to thereby decrease co-receptor availability on the cell surface (3Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Schlöndorff D. Proudfoot A.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). According to a current concept of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) regulation, largely extrapolated from detailed studies with the prototypic β2-adrenergic receptor, agonist activation of receptors leads to their phosphorylation by both second messenger-dependent protein kinases and GPCR kinases (GRKs) (4Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 5Bünemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This, in turn, promotes binding of members of the arrestin family. Arrestins bind to the ligand-activated/phosphorylated receptor and thereby sterically interfere with further binding of heterotrimeric G proteins. With many GPCRs, β-arrestins are essential for receptor internalization via clathrin-dependent mechanisms by their ability to directly couple the phosphorylated receptor to clathrin heavy chain and to recruit accessory proteins that participate in the formation of clathrin-coated pits (6Ferguson S.S.

Recent evidence suggests that arrestins play a broader role as signaling scaffolds, linking them to the activation of Src family tyrosine kinases and certain mitogen-activated protein kinase modules, in addition to their role in the regulation of receptor trafficking (9Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 130-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Together, these findings point to a central role for arrestins both in the termination and in the initiation of certain aspects of GPCR signaling. To date, four members of the arrestin family have been identified. Only β-arrestin 1 (arrestin 2) and β-arrestin 2 (arrestin 3) are ubiquitously expressed throughout the body and are predominantly localized in lymphoid and neuronal tissues (10Attramadal H.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) at atomic resolution has allowed us to propose a molecular mechanism by which arrestins interact with ligand-activated GPCR. According to this model arrestin in its inactive state is composed of two N- and C-terminal domains and is maintained in this basal conformation by multiple intramolecular hydrophobic interactions among highly conserved residues. Upon binding, the receptor-attached phosphates disrupt these intramolecular forces and thereby induce a structural reorganization of the arrestin molecule. This conformational change is accompanied by the exposure of currently unknown secondary binding sites that allow arrestin to bind with high affinity to the ligand-activated receptor. So far, the structural determinants on ligand-activated receptors that allow arrestins to interact with hundreds of different GPCR are not well characterized. Previously, we have shown that CC chemokines induce the rapid phosphorylation of CCR5 on four C-terminal serine residues, a process that is mediated by the combined action of GRKs and protein kinase C (19Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In a subsequent study the ligand-induced association of β-arrestins with CCR5 was monitored in real time by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (20Kraft K. Olbrich H. Majoul I. Mack M. Proudfoot A. Oppermann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34408-34418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Replacement of all four phosphorylated serine residues by alanine abrogated the ability of ligand-activated receptors to interact with β-arrestin, and this was accompanied by a defect in CCR5 desensitization and internalization. Here, we have further investigated the structural determinants that underlie β-arrestin binding to the chemokine-activated CCR5. To this end, we tested several CCR5 Ser/Ala replacement mutants that were stably expressed in RBL cells for their ability to recruit β-arrestins upon chemokine stimulation. An additional β-arrestin 1-binding site within a conserved region in the second cytoplasmic loop of CCR5 was identified by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. The functional significance of these findings was determined by investigating internalization and desensitization characteristics of the various receptor mutants.

The pEF-BOS expression vectors that encode human CCR5 with various combinations of C-terminal serine to alanine substitutions have been described before (19Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E.

Rat basophilic leukemia cell 2H3 subline (RBL-2H3) cells were transfected by electroporation (19Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol.

The RANTES-induced translocation of endogenous β-arrestins present in RBL cells from the cytosol to the membrane fraction was analyzed by subcellular fractionation. RBL-CCR5 cells (1 × 107/135-mm dish) were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of RANTES for up to 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were placed on ice and scraped into 3 ml of buffer A (10 mm PIPES, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) containing 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. The cells were homogenized by Dounce homogenization (10 strokes) and sonication (four 20-s bursts at 100 W). The nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was loaded on a discontinuous gradient of 50, 35, and 20% sucrose in buffer A and centrifuged at 160,000 × g and 4 °C for 2 h. The supernatant (cytosol) was removed, and the 20/35% sucrose interphase (membrane) was collected, diluted in 3 ml of buffer A, and recentrifuged at 160,000 × g and 4 °C for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of detergent buffer (20Kraft K. Olbrich H. Majoul I. Mack M. Proudfoot A. Oppermann M. J. Biol.

The protein content in 10-μl aliquots of the cytosolic and the membrane fraction was determined by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit, and 10 (cytosol) or 25 μg (membrane) of each protein sample was loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation for 1 h with 4% nonfat dry milk in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4. β-Arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 were detected using monoclonal anti-β-arrestin 1 antibodies (1:500) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (1:2000). The effect of RANTES stimulation on membrane-associated β-arrestin levels was quantitated by densitometric analysis (ImageMaster TotalLab software; AmershamBiosciences) of enhanced chemiluminescence films. To express β-arrestin 1 in mammalian cells, HEK-293 cells were transfected with pCMV/βarr1-His6 (21Lin F.T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Sixty hours after transfection, the cells were scraped into binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9) containing protease inhibitors and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. β-Arrestin 1 was purified to apparent homogeneity by nickel affinity chromatography as described (21Lin F.T.

Open table in a new tab The association of β-arrestin 1 with the CCR5 cytoplasmic loop and C-tail derived peptides was analyzed in real time by SPR using a BIAcore 3000 biosensor (BIAcore AB). The peptides were immobilized to CM5 biosensor chips via the thiol group of an N-terminal cysteine residue according to the manufacturer's instructions. The peptide corresponding to the CCR5 cytoplasmic IL-3 loop was synthesized with a biotin moiety attached to the N-terminal amino acid and immobilized to a streptavidin sensor surface (SA5 chip) according to standard procedures. Recombinant β-arrestin 1 was used at concentrations ranging from 50 to 600 nm in running buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol). All of the measurements were recorded at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Association (2 min) was followed by dissociation (2 min), during which running buffer was perfused. The sensor surface was regenerated after each experimental cycle by a pulse injection (15 s) of 10 mm NaOH, 0.5% SDS. The kinetic parameters of the interaction between β-arrestin 1 and receptor peptides and the equilibrium constant were calculated using the BIAevaluation software provided by the manufacturer (more details can be found in Ref. 22Jonsson U.

The internalization of 125I-RANTES by RBL-CCR5 cells was expressed as a percentage of internalized (acid-resistant) of the total radioactivity at different time points, as described before (20Kraft K.

For flow cytometric analysis, 2 × 105 RBL-CCR5 cells were washed twice in wash buffer (1% fetal calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% azide) and then incubated, in sequence, with anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibody T21/8 (10 μg/ml; 45 min/4 °C) and phycoerythrin-labeled goat polyclonal anti-mouse F(ab′)2 (1:100; 45 min/4 °C). The cells were analyzed with an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Coulter). The RANTES-inducedN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase release from CCR5 expressing RBL-2H3 cells was determined as described (24Montz H. Fuhrmann A. Schulze M. Götze O. Cell. Immunol. 1990; 127: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The values were expressed as percentages of total enzyme present in cells after lysis with 0.1% Triton X-100, and the data were analyzed using nonlinear regression applied to a sigmoidal dose response model with the Ligand Binding module of Sigma-Plot software (SPSS). Agonist-dependent intracellular calcium mobilization was measured in transfected RBL-2H3 cells as described (19Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Calcium decays from 80% of the peak height to basal levels were fitted to an exponential (a + b·e−t/τ), where the time constant τ reflects the ability of CCR5 variants to evoke a more or less sustained calcium response (25Christophe T.

Previously, our laboratory analyzed a series of CCR5 serine to alanine mutants that were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells for their abilities to undergo ligand-induced phosphorylation (19Oppermann M.

In this study, several of these receptor constructs were stably transfected into RBL-2H3 cells, and we examined whether the constructs bind β-arrestins and undergo receptor internalization and desensitization upon RANTES stimulation. RBL-2H3 cells are of myeloid origin and have been shown to express high endogenous levels of GRK2/3 and both β-arrestins (arrestin 2 and arrestin 3) (19Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H.

CCR5 expression levels of the various cell lines were determined by flow cytometry using a monoclonal antibody (T21/8) with specificity for a CCR5 N-terminal epitope, and signaling characteristics were evaluated by testing the abilities to release glucosaminidase after RANTES stimulation (Table I). In whole cell phosphorylation experiments with these RBL-CCR5 cell lines (data not shown), we confirmed the effect of serine to alanine substitution in various combinations on receptor phosphorylation that we had previously observed when receptor constructs were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (19Oppermann M.

Open table in a new tab We have shown by fluorescence resonance energy transfer technology that wild type CCR5, but not a phosphorylation-deficient CCR5 mutant with alanine substitution of all four C-terminal serine residues rapidly interacts with β-arrestin upon RANTES stimulation (20Kraft K. Olbrich H. Majoul I. Mack M. Proudfoot A. Oppermann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34408-34418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We now established a simple translocation assay based on subcellular fractionation of RBL cellular lysates that measures ligand-induced recruitment of β-arrestins from the cytosol to the cell membrane. This assay is based on an anti-β-arrestin 1 monoclonal antibody, which significantly cross-reacts with β-arrestin 2 (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig.1B, treatment of RBL-CCR5 cells with 10 nmRANTES, but not with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, leads to a more than 3-fold increase of two membrane-associated proteins that were identified as β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2, respectively, by virtue of being immunoreactive with the anti-β-arrestin antibody and migration at the same apparent molecular masses of 54 and 48 kDa as the β-arrestin 1/2 cDNA products from HEK-293 cells. Because this effect was absent in untransfected RBL cells, it directly reflects the ability of ligand-activated CCR5 to recruit β-arrestins to the cell membrane. Translocation of β-arrestins was induced by as little as 1 nm and reached a maximum at 10 nm RANTES (EC50 = 2.4 nm; Fig. 1C). β-Arrestins rapidly associate with the membrane fraction after stimulation with saturating concentrations of RANTES; maximum levels were observed after stimulation for 3–10 min (Fig. 1D). To determine the minimal requirements of receptor phosphorylation for CCR5/β-arrestin association, we investigated RANTES-induced β-arrestin translocation to the cell membrane in RBL cells that express various CCR5 Ser/Ala mutants (Fig.2). All CCR5 mutants with alanine replacements of one or two C-terminal serine residues were capable of inducing translocation of β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 in a significant (p < 0.05) manner and to a similar degree (2.6–4.6-fold increase of membrane-associated β-arrestin upon RANTES stimulation) to that of wild type CCR5. In contrast, alanine mutation of any three C-terminal serine residues essentially eliminated the ability of the receptor to recruit β-arrestins. Overall, no significant differences were observed in the binding of the two β-arrestin isoforms to the various receptor mutants. We conclude from these experiments that β-arrestin 1 or β-arrestin 2 binding to ligand-activated CCR5 requires the presence of at least two intact C-terminal receptor phosphorylation sites, but the exact position of these sites is not critical. Next, we asked how the abilities of various RBL-CCR5 mutants to induce β-arrestin membrane translocation correlate with their capacities to internalize activated receptors into the intracellular membrane compartment of RBL cells. We had previously reported that125I-RANTES is rapidly taken up by RBL-CCR5 cells and that endocytosis is significantly impaired in RBL cells that express a phosphorylation-deficient CCR5 mutant with alanine mutation of all four serine residues (20Kraft K. Olbrich H. Majoul I. Mack M. Proudfoot A. Oppermann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34408-34418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We now show (Fig.3) that internalization of receptor mutants with alanine replacements of any single or two serine residues proceeds in a time-dependent manner that closely resembles wild type receptor internalization. In contrast, substitution of three C-terminal serine residues by alanine in various combinations significantly impaired the early rapid phase of ligand uptake to a similar degree as was observed with the completely phosphorylation-deficient CCR5-Δ4 mutant. Again, the exact position of the various mutated C-terminal phosphorylation sites did not appear to be critical. In a previous study we had shown that phosphorylation-deficient CCR5 mutants that do not b"

Monitoring of biomolecular interaction analysis can be achieved by BIAcore technology that is based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR).1 The physical phenomenon of SPR is widely used to visualize macromolecular interactions in real time with the advantages of no labeling requirements and the option to determine kinetic rate constants. It is mostly applied to quantification of antigen/antibody binding, receptor ligand screening, or characterization of protein modification. It has not been used so far to investigate enzyme-enzyme interactions, in particular with respect to regulation of the metabolic activity of multienzyme complexes.In this study we have applied SPR to analyze the interaction of a hetero-oligomeric metabolic protein complex using the enzymes of cysteine biosynthesis from mitochondria of Arabidopsis thaliana.

The advantages of these quaternary organizations include efficient catalysis rates and stabilization of intermediates by prevention of losses of intermediates into solution by diffusion (1Huang X.

However, substrate channeling is not realized in the CSC, because a ready release of the reaction intermediate O-acetylserine (OAS) into the surrounding solution was observed for the bacterial complex (5Cook P.F. Wedding R.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).The reason for the association of SAT and OAS-TL in the CSC is therefore unknown, despite the fact that the importance of this final step of sulfate assimilation is comparable with the fixation of ammonia by glutamine synthetase in nitrate assimilation (4Kredich N.M.

Nuclear encoded cDNAs of SAT and OAS-TL for each compartment-specific isoform have been cloned from several plants including A. thaliana (8Noji M. Inoue K. Kimura N. Gouda A. Saito K. J. Biol.

Expression analysis revealed semi-constitutive activity of the corresponding genes with only moderate up-regulation of mRNA steady-state levels in response to external factors such as sulfate deprivation or salt stress (10Takahashi H. Yamazaki M. Sasakura N. Watanabe A. Leustek T. de Almeida Engler J. Engler G. van Montagu M. Saito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Metabolic regulation appears to be more important for the control of flux of reduced sulfur into cysteine. Feedback inhibition by cysteine of the cytosolic SAT isoform, but cysteine insensitivity of the plastid and mitochondrial isoforms from A. thaliana, is an element of a regulatory model for cysteine synthesis (6Saito K. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 8Noji M. Inoue K. Kimura N. Gouda A. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32739-32745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).An additional regulatory mechanism may be provided by the reaction intermediate OAS. As suggested by feeding experiments, OAS is involved in the de-repression of genes encoding sulfate transporters, enzymes of sulfate reduction, and a seed storage protein during sulfate deficiency (6Saito K. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 14Smith F.W. Hawkesford M.J. Ealing P.M. Clarkson D.T. Vanden Berg P.J. Belcher A.R. Warrilow A.G.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Furthermore, incubation of the intact CSC with OAS dissociates the complex in vitro and results in changes of kinetic properties and activity of both enzymes; free SAT tends to aggregate, becomes unstable, and loses affinity to serine and acetyl-CoA; free OAS-TL, on the contrary, gains activity and increases its affinity to OAS and sulfide (3Kredich N.M. Becker M.A. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2428-2439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Droux M. Ruffet M.-L. Douce R. Job D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These findings are corroborated by the identification of a bifunctional C-terminal domain of SAT from A. thaliana that is responsible for catalysis and protein-protein interaction with OAS-TL (18Bogdanova N. Hell R. Plant J. 1997; 11: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 19Wirtz M. Berkowitz O. Droux M. Hell R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The low activity of OAS-TL in the CSC apparently is the reason for diffusion of OAS into the surrounding solution, thus preventing any substrate channeling (5Cook P.F. Wedding R.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An in vivo dissociation of the CSC may indeed occur, as suggested by the recent observations of increased OAS levels in response to sulfate starvation in A. thaliana (15Kim H. Hirai M.Y. Hayashi H. Chino M. Naito S. Fujiwara T. Planta. 1999; 209: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 20Awazuhara M. Hirai M.Y. Hayashi H. Chino M. Naito S. Fujiwara T. Brunold C. Rennenberg H., De Kok L.J. Stulen I. Davidian J.-C. Sulfur Nutrition and Sulfur Assimilation in Higher Plants. P. Haupt Publ., Bern2000: 331-333Google Scholar). The association and dissociation of CSC in the absence or presence of OAS have been depicted in a preliminary reaction scheme in Fig.1.In this study we have applied SPR to elucidate the function of this protein complex. The homomeric subunits were found to behave similar to single polypeptide chains. This allowed modeling of interaction kinetics based on a simple A + B ⇔ AB principle and demonstrated that SPR-based BIAcore technology (21Chaiken I. Rose S. Karlsson R. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) can be applied to quantitative kinetic analysis of a multimeric protein complex. The assessment of OAS effects on CSC dissociation eliminates any function in substrate channeling common to other metabolic multimeric complexes. Instead, the kinetics obtained provide the first evidence for a function of the dissociation state of a metabolic enzyme complex as a regulatory switch for the entire upstream biosynthetic pathway.DISCUSSIONThis study provides a quantitative kinetic description of the effect of the putative effector OAS on the enzyme-enzyme interaction in the mitochondrial CSC from A. thaliana. As a prerequisite for a detailed kinetic investigation, a preparation protocol for the mitochondrial CSC from A. thaliana and its free subunits, SAT and OAS-TL, was established that allows rapid purification at high yield, purity, and activity after expression in E. coli. Within less than 2 h CSC representing up to 10% of total soluble bacterial protein was purified to apparent homogeneity. This corresponds to an ∼20-fold improvement of yield compared with previous preparations of recombinant CSCs (17Droux M. Ruffet M.-L. Douce R. Job D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Wirtz M. Berkowitz O. Droux M. Hell R. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1999; 63: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast to free cytosolic SAT from A. thaliana (17Droux M. Ruffet M.-L. Douce R. Job D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), the mitochondrial SAT analyzed in this study proved to be quite stable in the absence of OAS-TL. This difference may be intrinsic for the different compartmental SAT isoforms from A. thaliana or a result of the different fusion tags and isolation procedures.Our CSC preparation confirmed several characteristic features of the CSC that have been partly described for CSCs from bacteria (3Kredich N.M. Becker M.A. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2428-2439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cook P.F. Wedding R.T. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 1992; 295: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) as follows: bound OAS-TL is much less active than the free enzyme; OAS can dissociate the CSC; OAS-TL released from the complex gains full activity as compared with free OAS-TL dimers. Based on these special properties an activity assay using OAS pretreatment of the complex with increasing OAS concentrations was developed that allowed us to correlate the activation of OAS-TL with the degree of dissociation of the CSC. The observed Michaelis-Menten constant for OAS of Km = 57 μm indicated a 50% dissociation already far below the millimolar OAS concentrations conventionally used to disrupt the complex in vitro (3Kredich N.M. Becker M.A. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2428-2439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Droux M. Ruffet M.-L. Douce R. Job D. Eur. J.

Furthermore, significant shifts in the equilibrium between CSC and free subunits can be predicted in response to even small changes of OAS concentrations in vivo.A quantitative assessment of the kinetic behavior of SAT and OAS-TL interaction was required to gain evidence for a putative regulatory function of this metabolic protein complex system. However, dissociation kinetics of a hetero-oligomeric complex of 300–350 kDa might be expected to be quite complicated because of the multitude of possible interaction sites between protein subunits. This study shows that biomolecular interaction analysis using SPR can be suitable for the analytical description of such mechanisms. Binding characteristics and binding stability of real time interaction as detected by BIAcore were carefully monitored and evaluated with respect to feasibility of a simple A + B ⇔ AB model for association and dissociation of the CSC. In a first approximation, the binding kinetics observed indeed strongly suggest such tight SAT and OAS-TL homomers, respectively, that their interaction at the sensor surface can be sufficiently described with this model. Significant statistical deviation of the dissociation rate from an ideal mono-exponential function was only observed during long term monitoring (45 min). Intermediate steps during the dissociation reaction of the multimeric complex might be able to cause this difference or an overlay of complex dissociation with release of the SAT anchor protein from the nickel matrix of the chip. However, such bleeding of SAT was very minor (Fig. 4A). Whereas a SAT tetramer is assumed to bind two OAS-TL dimers (3Kredich N.M. Becker M.A. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2428-2439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Droux M. Martin J. Sajus P. Douce R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30Warrilow A.G.S. Hawkesford M.J. J. Exp. Bot. 2000; 51: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the loading of immobilized SAT with saturating concentrations of OAS-TL yielded a 2:1 ratio of SAT to OAS-TL. This may be caused by blocking of OAS-TL interaction domains on SAT subunits due to the fixed histidine-nickel-binding site, although such a steric inhibition was not observed during affinity tag isolations of the CSC (Fig. 2) (17Droux M. Ruffet M.-L. Douce R. Job D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar,19Wirtz M. Berkowitz O. Droux M. Hell R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A 2:1 quaternary organization of the native complex cannot be excluded, because the SAT homomer from E. coli was recently reported (29Hindson V.J. Moody P.C.E. Rowe A.J. Shaw W.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 461-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to consist of a dimer of trimers instead of a tetramer. It has to be considered, however, that these analyses were performed in the absence of OAS-TL.The equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction of mitochondrial SAT and OAS-TL in the absence of any effector (KD = 25 ± 4 nm) is in agreement with the KD value of 41 nm determined for the interaction between cytosolic SAT from A. thalianaand plastid OAS-TL from spinach (17Droux M. Ruffet M.-L. Douce R. Job D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The application of the SPR-based biosensor method with an immobilized ligand thus confirms the analysis of the heterologous CSC that had been determined with soluble components in a velocity versus [OAS-TL] plot (17Droux M. Ruffet M.-L. Douce R. Job D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). TheKD of the CSC indicates a very stable complex that in fact is comparable with the interactions of antibody-antigen and receptor-ligand partners.The effect of OAS on the dissociation of the CSC on the BIAcore chip surface was best described by a Hill plot that suggested strong cooperativity for the dissociation of SAT and OAS-TL. According to this fit, 77 μm OAS is sufficient to achieve the half-maximal dissociation rate. This is in exactly the same range as theKm value of 58 μm OAS required to adjust 50% equilibrium dissociation state of the complex. Changes of OAS concentrations in a very narrow range thus are bound to cause fast and almost complete association or dissociation of the CSC. It is important to note that the OAS concentrations relevant for complex dissociation are far below the substrate affinities of free and bound OAS-TL enzymes for OAS that range around 1 mm (9Jost R. Berkowitz O. Wirtz M. Smith L. Hawkesford M.J. Hell R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 253: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Droux M. Martin J. Sajus P. Douce R. Arch. Biochem.

Bot. 2000; 51: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), whereas dissociation constants of OAS-TL dimers for OAS are below 10 μm. 2M. Wirtz and R. Hell, manuscript in preparation.Dissociation effects can therefore become effective before substantial catalytic activity can take place. Taken together, such kinetic behavior provides an ideal molecular switch for regulation of downstream processes in a threshold-dependent manner.Indeed, a regulatory function for OAS in regulation of sulfur metabolism has been suspected (7Leustek T. Martin M.N. Bick J.-A. Davies J.P. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 141-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 14Smith F.W. Hawkesford M.J. Ealing P.M. Clarkson D.T.

OAS concentrations have been described to differ between 2 and 56 nmol/g FW, respectively, in rosette leaves of 9-week-old sulfur-sufficient and sulfur-limited A. thaliana plants (20Awazuhara M. Hirai M.Y. Hayashi H. Chino M. Naito S. Fujiwara T. Brunold C. Rennenberg H., De Kok L.J. Stulen I. Davidian J.-C. Sulfur Nutrition and Sulfur Assimilation in Higher Plants. P. Haupt Publ., Bern2000: 331-333Google Scholar). In sulfur-deprived potato leaves OAS levels increase from 3 to 6 nmol/g FW to 220 nmol/g FW within 8 days. 3L. Hopkins and M. J. Hawkesford, personal communication. The cellular contents of OAS increase from 0.3 to 3.8 nmol/g FW in A. thaliana suspension cultures within 72 h after transfer to sulfate-depleted medium. 4M. Wirtz and R. Hell, manuscript in preparation.Assuming that OAS is not localized to the vacuole, a calculation based on relative volumes of cell compartments (33Bowsher C.G. Tobin A.K. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 513-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) yields cellular OAS concentrations between 10 and 60 μm during sulfur-sufficient and 60–200 μm during sulfur-limited conditions. Intracellular OAS fluctuations would thus occur in the critical range of CSC dissociation.Our findings therefore provide for the first time the quantitative basis for essential elements of a hypothesis for the function of the CSC (17Droux M. Ruffet M.-L. Douce R. Job D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 32Hell R. Habilitation Thesis, Ruhr-Universität Bochum 1997. Shaker, Aachen, Germany1998: 23-41Google Scholar). In this model SAT and OAS-TL are associated in the presence of sufficient sulfur in the cell, because sulfide stabilizes the complex and OAS levels are low (Fig.6). OAS leaves the CSC because of the low affinity of bound OAS-TL and is consumed to produce cysteine by free OAS-TL dimers (3Kredich N.M. Becker M.A. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2428-2439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Droux M. Ruffet M.-L. Douce R. Job D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). If the cells encounter sulfate deficiency, sulfide levels will drop and OAS will accumulate to concentrations that are sufficient to effectively dissociate the CSC. Consequently, SAT would become less active by degradation or modification, and at the same time OAS could trigger the de-repression sulfate uptake and assimilation (14Smith F.W. Hawkesford M.J.

Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thereby the system becomes reversible, because sulfate enters the cell and after reduction sulfide reacts with the accumulated OAS via free OAS-TL dimers. Lowered OAS levels now promote formation of the CSC from free OAS-TL and reactivated or newly synthesized SAT. It is concluded that the plant CSC functions as a molecular sensor system that monitors the sulfur status of the cell and controls sulfate assimilation and cysteine synthesis according to the availability of sulfate.FIG. 6Model of the function of OAS-driven reversible protein-protein interaction of SAT (squares) and OAS-TL (circles) in the regulation of cysteine synthesis rate and expression of sulfate uptake and assimilation genes.

Monitoring of biomolecular interaction analysis can be achieved by BIAcore technology that is based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR).1 The physical phenomenon of SPR is widely used to visualize macromolecular interactions in real time with the advantages of no labeling requirements and the option to determine kinetic rate constants. It is mostly applied to quantification of antigen/antibody binding, receptor ligand screening, or characterization of protein modification. It has not been used so far to investigate enzyme-enzyme interactions, in particular with respect to regulation of the metabolic activity of multienzyme complexes. In this study we have applied SPR to analyze the interaction of a hetero-oligomeric metabolic protein complex using the enzymes of cysteine biosynthesis from mitochondria of Arabidopsis thaliana. Serine acetyltransferase (SAT; EC 2.3.1.30) generates the activated sulfide acceptor O-acetylserine (OAS) from serine and acetyl-CoA. O-Acetylserine (thiol)-lyase (OAS-TL; EC 4.2.99.8) then inserts free sulfide in a β-replacement reaction to synthesize cysteine and acetate. One tetramer of SAT and two dimers of OAS-TL are presumed to form the hetero-oligomeric cysteine synthase complex (CSC) that was first described for Salmonella typhimurium (3Kredich N.M.

Protein-protein interactions of such metabolic enzymes mostly serve to channel substrate intermediates between active sites of sequential reaction steps of a pathway. The advantages of these quaternary organizations include efficient catalysis rates and stabilization of intermediates by prevention of losses of intermediates into solution by diffusion (1Huang X.

https://openalex.org/W2124746492,"Previous studies with McA-RH7777 cells showed a 15–20-min temporal delay in the oleate treatment-induced assembly of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) after apolipoprotein (apo) B100 translation, suggesting a post-translational process. Here, we determined whether the post-translational assembly of apoB100-VLDL occurred within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or in post-ER compartments using biochemical and microscopic techniques. At steady state, apoB100 distributed throughout ER and Golgi, which were fractionated by Nycodenz gradient centrifugation. Pulse-chase experiments showed that it took about 20 min for newly synthesized apoB100 to exit the ER and to accumulate in the cis/medial Golgi. At the end of a subsequent 20-min chase, a small fraction of apoB100 accumulated in the distal Golgi, and a large amount of apoB100 was secreted into the medium as VLDL. VLDL was not detected either in the lumen of ER or in that ofcis/medial Golgi where apoB100 was membrane-associated and sensitive to endoglycosidase H treatment. In contrast, VLDL particles were found in the lumen of the distal Golgi where apoB100 was resistant to endoglycosidase H. Formation of lumenal VLDL almost coincided with the appearance of VLDL in the medium, suggesting that the site of VLDL assembly is proximal to the site of secretion. When microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity was inactivated after apoB had exited the ER, VLDL formation in the distal Golgi and its subsequent secretion was unaffected. Lipid analysis by tandem mass spectrometry showed that oleate treatment increased the masses of membrane phosphatidylcholine (by 68%) and phosphatidylethanolamine (by 27%) and altered the membrane phospholipid profiles of ER and Golgi. Taken together, these results suggest that VLDL assembly in McA-RH7777 cells takes place in compartments at the distal end of the secretory pathway. Previous studies with McA-RH7777 cells showed a 15–20-min temporal delay in the oleate treatment-induced assembly of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) after apolipoprotein (apo) B100 translation, suggesting a post-translational process.

VLDL was not detected either in the lumen of ER or in that ofcis/medial Golgi where apoB100 was membrane-associated and sensitive to endoglycosidase H treatment. In contrast, VLDL particles were found in the lumen of the distal Golgi where apoB100 was resistant to endoglycosidase H. Formation of lumenal VLDL almost coincided with the appearance of VLDL in the medium, suggesting that the site of VLDL assembly is proximal to the site of secretion. When microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity was inactivated after apoB had exited the ER, VLDL formation in the distal Golgi and its subsequent secretion was unaffected. Lipid analysis by tandem mass spectrometry showed that oleate treatment increased the masses of membrane phosphatidylcholine (by 68%) and phosphatidylethanolamine (by 27%) and altered the membrane phospholipid profiles of ER and Golgi. Taken together, these results suggest that VLDL assembly in McA-RH7777 cells takes place in compartments at the distal end of the secretory pathway. very low density lipoprotein apolipoprotein immunoglobulin-binding protein β subunit of coatomer-protein I coatomer-protein II Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium early endosomal antigen 1 endoglycosidase H endoplasmic reticulum endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment fetal bovine serum glucose-regulated protein high density lipoprotein heat shock protein intermediate density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein α-mannosidase II microsomal triglyceride transfer protein phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine peptide:N-glycosidase F transmission electron microscopy triacylglycerol trans-Golgi network The very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)1 synthesized in the liver carries various amounts of triacylglycerol (TG) in the neutral lipid core surrounded by phospholipids, cholesterol, and apolipoproteins. Each VLDL particle contains a single copy of apolipoprotein (apo) B100, an extremely hydrophobic and glycosylated polypeptide of ∼550 kDa (1Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25621-25624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat liver secretes VLDL that contains either apoB100 or apoB48 (N-terminal 48% of apoB100). We previously showed that in rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells, assembly of apoB48- or apo100-VLDL could be induced by exogenous oleate and was achieved after apoB translation (2Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The TG-rich VLDL (e.g.VLDL1, Sf > 100) that contained35S-labeled apoB100 was undetectable within the microsomal lumen until 20–40 min after continuous labeling (2Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Results from pulse-chase experiments also demonstrated that it took about 35 min (20-min pulse and 15-min chase) for VLDL1 to appear in the lumen of microsomes after apoB synthesis (2Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The time spent for VLDL1 assembly is equivalent to that required for newly synthesized apoB100 to traverse through the secretory pathway (3Bostrom K. Wettesten M. Boren J. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13800-13806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bamberger M.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11868-11878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that bulk TG is not incorporated into VLDL immediately after apoB100 translation and suggest the existence of post-translational events. A model that describes the post-translational event and is supported by a good number of experimental evidence is the two-step VLDL assembly model (5Janero D.R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14496-14504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Higgins J.A. Hutson J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1295-1305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Swift L.L. J.

FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). According to this model, the newly synthesized apoB100 polypeptides start to recruit, with the assistance of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) (2Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Gregg R.E. Olofsson S.O. Boren J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), surface lipids and a small quantity of neutral lipids during and immediately after translation. At this stage, apoB100 polypeptide remains associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (11Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 12Stillemark P. Boren J. Andersson M. Larsson T. Rustaeus S. Karlsson K.A. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10506-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the resulting lipoprotein particle has buoyant density resembling that of high density lipoproteins (HDL) (13Boren J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Boren J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Normally, these HDL-like particles are not secreted as such. Rather, they combine with bulk neutral lipids (the second step) to form buoyant low density lipoproteins (LDL), intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL), or VLDL that are detectable in the lumen of microsomes (2Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Stillemark P. Boren J. Andersson M. Larsson T. Rustaeus S. Karlsson K.A. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10506-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Acquisition of bulk neutral lipids in the second step appears to be independent of the MTP activity (10Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Gregg R.E. Olofsson S.O. Boren J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33047-33053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 11Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4413-4421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). What remains unclear is the subcellular compartments where bulk neutral lipids are incorporated into VLDL containing apoB100. To date, two models have been proposed, and both are supported by experimental evidence. The first model suggests that VLDL assembly takes place in the ER. The “ER assembly” model postulates that the newly synthesized apoB is retained within the rough ER until VLDL, whose size, buoyancy, and lipid composition are indistinguishable from that of secreted VLDL, is fully assembled (16Rusinol A. Verkade H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3555-3562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting ER-derived VLDL is then traversed through the secretory pathway and secreted. The second model theorizes that VLDL assembly occurs in post-ER compartments. This “post-ER assembly” model was suggested by experimental data where the rates of intracellular trafficking between apoB and lipids were compared (4Bamberger M.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11868-11878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bamberger M.J. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2390-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the lipid contents of apoB-containing lipoproteins between different subcellular compartments were determined (7Swift L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Higgins J.A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis provided evidence that the rate of TG transit from ER to Golgi was distinct from that of apoB, which ruled in the possibility of a post-ER event (4Bamberger M.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11868-11878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bamberger M.J. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2390-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies showed the highest amount of lipids associated with apoB intrans-Golgi as compared with cis-Golgi and rough and smooth ER (7Swift L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Higgins J.A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting a stepwise acquisition of lipids along the secretory pathway (18Swift L.L. Valyi-Nagy K. Rowland C. Harris C. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 218-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, results suggesting post-ER assembly of VLDL containing apoB48 in McA-RH7777 cells have been reported (12Stillemark P. Boren J. Andersson M. Larsson T. Rustaeus S. Karlsson K.A. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10506-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The present study aims to determine the assembly site for VLDL containing apoB100. Glycerol [14C]trioleate (57 mCi/mmol), [35S]methionine/cysteine (1000 Ci/mmol), [3H]palmitic acid (52 Ci/mmol), protein A-Sepharose™ CL-4B beads, and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Labeled goat anti-mouse (Alexa Fluor™ 488) or anti-rabbit (Alexa Fluor™ 594) IgG antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) and peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) were obtained from New England BioLabs. Fibronectin, oleic acid, triacylglycerol, and phospholipid standards were obtained from Sigma and Avanti Polar Lipids. Monoclonal antibody against TGN38 and polyclonal anti-β-COP, -COPII, or -early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) were obtained from Affinity Bioreagents. Monoclonal antibody recognizing proteins containing the KDEL motif (Bip, Grp94, and Hsp47) and polyclonal anti-calnexin antiserum were obtained from StressGen. Monoclonal anti-human apoB antibody 1D1 was a gift of R. Milne and Y. Marcel (University of Ottawa Heart Institute). Polyclonal anti-α-mannosidase II (ManII) and anti-MTP antiserum were gifts from M. G. Farquhar (University of San Diego) and C. C. Shoulders (Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK), respectively. Polyclonal antiserum against human LDL was produced in our laboratory. The MTP inhibitor BMS-197636 was a gift of D. Gordon (Bristol-Myers Squibb). Protease inhibitor mixture and chemiluminescent blotting substrate were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Culture plate inserts (0.4 μm MILLICELL™-CM, 30-mm diameter) were purchased from Millipore. Transfected McA-RH7777 cells stably expressing human apoB100 (19McLeod R.S. Zhao Y. Selby S.L. Westerlund J. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2852-2862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10% horse serum, and 200 μg/ml G418. During experiments, the cells were kept in DMEM containing 20% FBS plus other reagents as indicated in the figure legends. Two to four 100-mm dishes of cells were harvested in 2 ml of ice-cold homogenizing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, and serine/cysteine protease inhibitor mixture) and homogenized by passing 10 times through a ball-bearing homogenizer. Post-nuclear supernatant was obtained by centrifugation (9,500 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C, Sorvall SS-34 rotor) and subjected to fractionation by centrifugation in a Nycodenz gradient as described previously (20Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 21Rickwood D. Ford T. Graham J. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 123: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). First, a step gradient was created in Beckman SW41 centrifuge tubes by loading (top to bottom) 2.5 ml of 10, 14.66, 19.33, and 24% of Nycodenz solution in saline buffer. The solutions were prepared from 27.6% Nycodenz stock solution and 0.75% NaCl (both in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.02% NaN3). The tube was sealed with Parafilm and placed horizontally for 45 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation (37,000 rpm, 4 h, 15 °C, SW41 rotor). Once a nonlinear gradient was formed after centrifugation, 2 ml of the post-nuclear supernatant was layered on top of the gradient and fractionated by centrifugation (37,000 rpm, 1.5 h, 15 °C). After centrifugation, 15 fractions (0.8 ml each) were collected from top of the tube (see Fig. 4A, left three columns). An aliquot of each fraction (50 μl) was mixed with an equal volume of two-time concentrated protein sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE (3–15% gel). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with antibodies specific for marker proteins of various subcellular compartments. The cells were plated on coverslips for 24 h, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (in phosphate-buffered saline) for 3 min. The cells were incubated with 10% FBS (in phosphate-buffered saline) for 20 min prior to probing with antibodies. Monoclonal antibody 1D1 (1:1000 dilution) was used to probe the recombinant human apoB (1 h) followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa FluorTM 488 (1:200 dilution) as a secondary antibody (1 h). Subcellular compartments were probed with antibodies against calnexin (1:500 dilution) for ER, COPII (1:150 dilution) for ER-to-Golgi anterograde vesicles, ManII (1:500 dilution) for cis/medial Golgi, β-COP (1:100 dilution) for Golgi anterograde/retrograde vesicles, and EEA1 (1:100 dilution) for endosomes. The secondary antibody was Alexa FluorTM 594 conjugated with anti-rabbit IgG (1:200). All incubations and washes were performed at room temperature. After immunostaining, the coverslips were mounted onto a glass slide using SlowFade AntiFade kits (Molecular Probes). The images were captured by a MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal imaging system. In pulse-chase experiments where lumenal apoB100 particles of different subcellular fractions were determined, the cells in two 100-mm dishes were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (200 μCi/ml in 3 ml of methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM containing 20% FBS and 0.4 mm oleate) for 20 min. The cells were then incubated with chase medium (DMEM containing 20% FBS and 0.4 mm oleate) for 15, 30, and 45 min. At the end of each chase time, the medium was collected and subjected to cumulative rate flotation centrifugation (2Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to resolve apoB100-VLDL1 (Sf > 100) and apoB100-VLDL2 (Sf 20–100) from other lipoproteins (i.e. IDL, LDL, and HDL). The35S-apoB100 in each fraction was recovered by immunoprecipitation using polyclonal antiserum raised against human LDL as described previously (22Tran K. Wang Y. DeLong C.J. Cui Z. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25023-25030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Also, at the end of each chase time, the radiolabeled cells were harvested in 2 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer, mixed with two 100-mm dishes of unlabeled cells, and subjected to subcellular fractionation and carbonate treatment as described below. In experiments where transit of newly synthesized apoB100 along the secretory pathway was determined, the cells were pulse-labeled for 10 min, washed, and incubated with chase medium containing 10 μm cycloheximide for 10, 20, 40, 80, and 120 min. The medium and cell samples were processed at the end of chase time as described above, except that the one dish of labeled cells was mixed with one dish of unlabeled cells prior to subcellular fractionation. In experiments where intracellular distribution of membrane- and lumen-associated apoB100 was determined, the cells were pulse-labeled for 20 min and incubated with chase medium for 0, 15, 30, and 45 min. apoB100 associated with membrane and lumenal content was isolated and analyzed as described below. In experiments where MTP was inactivated by BMS-197636, two protocols were used. In the first protocol, MTP activity was inhibited prior to apoB synthesis. To do this, cells were incubated with 0.2 μm BMS-197636 for 30 min, pulse-labeled with 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine for 20 min, and chased first for 15 min and second with fresh medium for additional 30 min. Oleate (0.4 mm) and BMS-197636 (0.2 μm) were present throughout pulse and chase. In the second protocol, MTP activity was inhibited after apoB had exited the ER. To achieve this, the MTP inhibitor was added to the medium during the second chase (30 min). Each Nycodenz fraction was added with an equal volume of 0.2 m Na2CO3, pH 12.4 (to reach a final concentration of 0.1 m and pH 11.3) and gently mixed for 30 min at room temperature. The membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (100,000 rpm, 15 °C, 16 min, TLA 100.4 rotor) and resuspended in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The mixture was diluted to 0.2% SDS, and apoB was recovered by immunoprecipitation. For lumenal apoB100, the 15 Nycodenz fractions were pooled into three groups: fractions 1–3, 4–8, and 9–15 (see Fig. 4A, right three columns). Each group was dialyzed against 250 mm sucrose in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 2 h at room temperature to remove Nycodenz and mixed with an equal volume of 0.2 mNa2CO3, pH 12.4, as described above. In some experiments, lumenal apoB100 was released by carbonate treatment in the presence of 0.025% sodium deoxycholate and 1.2 m potassium chloride as described (11Rustaeus S. Stillemark P. Lindberg K. Gordon D. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5196-5203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Tran K. Wang Y. DeLong C.J. Cui Z. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25023-25030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The lumenal content of the carbonate-treated microsomes was separated from membranes by centrifugation (100,000 rpm, 15 °C, 16 min, TLA 100.4 rotor) and subjected to cumulative rate flotation centrifugation (2Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated apoB100 from 35S-labeled or unlabeled samples was eluted from protein A-Sepharose beads by mixing with 90 μl of denaturing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol). The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 10 min, and an aliquot (30 μl) was mixed with either 3 μl of 0.5 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, for Endo H (500 units) digestion or else 3 μl of 0.5m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, for PNGase F (500 units) digestion (both 4 h at 37 °C). The apoB100 and35S-apoB100 were analyzed by PAGE/immunoblot and PAGE/fluorography, respectively. The membrane-associated apoB100, because of its abundance, was detected by immunoblotting, and the lumenal apoB100 was detected by radiolabeling (see figure legends for details). The cells were kept in DMEM (20% FBS ± 0.4 mm oleate) for 16 h and reincubated with fresh medium (20% FBS ± 0.4 mm oleate) for additional 2 h. The membrane and lumen samples of Nycodenz fractions 1–3, 4–8, and 9–15 were derived from cells pooled from eight 100-mm dishes. The conditioned media were subjected to cumulative rate flotation centrifugation (2Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The lipids were extracted from the samples with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/saturated NaCl/H2O (4:2:0.1:1:2, by volume) in the presence of 230 pmol of dimirystoyl (14:0-14:0) PC and 110 pmol of dipalmitoyl (16:0-16:0) PE as internal standards. Aliquots of lipid extracts were applied to tandem mass spectrometry, and the molecular species (i.e. fatty acid composition) of PC and PE was determined by daughter ion analysis in the negative ion mode as described previously (22Tran K. Wang Y. DeLong C.J. Cui Z. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25023-25030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23DeLong C.J. Shen Y.J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The integrated area under the peak or peak height of each molecular species was quantified by comparing with that of internal standards. The cells were cultured in normal culture medium on MILLICELL™-CM insert membranes precoated with fibronectin for 20 h and incubated for additional 2 h with fresh DMEM containing 20% FBS and 0.4 mm oleate. After rinsing with serum-free DMEM three times (5 min/rinse), the cells were prefixed for 1 h at room temperature with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% CaCl2 and post-fixed for 1 h at 4 °C with 1% OsO4, 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide (24Thorne-Tjomsland G. Dumontier M. Jamieson J.C. Anat. Rec. 1998; 250: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After rinsing with cacodylate buffer, the cells attached to the insert membranes were dehydrated in a series of ethanol and embedded in Epon in a Fisher metal foil pan (polymerization at 68 °C). Epon disks were cut into ∼2.5 × 2.5 × 1-mm3 pieces, which were mounted on Epon blocks with insert membranes oriented parallel to the cutting surface. Sections of silver-gold interference colors (60–150 nm) were cut on a Leica ultracut UCT microtome and placed on Formvar-coated, slotted copper grids. The grids were stained for 20 min with uranyl acetate and for 10 min with lead citrate and viewed at 75 kV in a Hitachi H-7000 transmission electron microscope. The diameters of lipoproteins were measured in 94 Golgi stacks from over 50 cells. Photographs were taken at negative magnification of 30,000 times, with positives magnified an additional 2.7–2.8 times. Included were all Golgi stacks with more than one lipoprotein/stack and definablecis-trans polarity by the presence of at least two of the following characteristics: 1) microtubules oriented parallel tocis-Golgi; 2) large perforations in cis-element; 3) clathrin-coated buds and vesicles on trans-Golgi; and 4) lipoprotein-filled secretory granules near trans-Golgi. Only particles definable along their entire circumference were included. For oval-shaped particles, the long diameter was measured. The TG transfer activity of MTP was determined according to a published method (25Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Gay G. Rader D.J. Gregg R.E. Science. 1992; 258: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) with modifications (2Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation with 0–0.5 μm MTP inhibitor BMS-197636 (in the presence of 0.4 mm oleate) for 30 min, the cells were homogenized using a ball-bearing homogenizer and sonicated twice for 30 s. The whole cell lysate was used in the glycerol [14C]trioleate transfer assay. The protein was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Subcellular compartments were fractionated using a Nycodenz gradient, and each fraction was probed with antibodies specific to marker proteins by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1, A–C). Three distinct subcellular compartments, namely ER, cis/medial Golgi, and distal Golgi, were separated. Fractions 9–15 were designated ER by their possessing of calnexin, MTP, protein disulfide isomerase, Grp78 (Bip), Grp94, and Hsp47 (see Fig. 4D). Fractions 4–8 were designatedcis/medial Golgi because they contained ManII and COPII (marker for ER-to-Golgi anterograde vesicles). The intermediate compartment between ER and Golgi marker p58 (a rat analog of human ERGIC53) had a bimodal distribution with two peaks at ER (fraction 15) and cis/medial Golgi (fraction 6), respectively. Fractions 1–3 represent a mix of trans-Golgi network, early endosome, and Golgi-derived retrograde/anterograde vesicles by appearance of TGN38, EEA1, and β-COP. At steady state, apoB100 distributed throughout the entire secretory pathway (Fig. 1D). Merging confocal images of immunocytochemistry confirmed co-localization of apoB (green color) with ER (calnexin), cis/medial Golgi (COPII and ManII), and distal Golgi (β-COP) markers (red color) (Fig. 2). However, apoB100 did not co-localize with the endosomal marker EEA1.FIG. 2Merging confocal images of apoB and markers.

At the end of the 10-min pulse, the majority of 35S-apoB100 was located in the ER, whereas a small portion appeared incis/medial Golgi (Fig.3A, 0 min chase). The presence of apoB100 in cis/medial Golgi after 10 min of labeling was not unexpected because translation was unsynchronized in these cells. Accumulation of 35S-apoB100 incis/medial Golgi became obvious at 10 min and peaked at 20 min during chase. At the end of a 40-min chase, 35S-apoB100 appeared in distal Golgi (fraction 3), and secretion of35S-apoB100 into the medium was detectable. Prolonged chase (i.e. 80 and 120 min) resulted in further accumulation of35S-apoB100 in the medium but did not result in accumulation of 35S-apoB100 in distal Golgi. These results suggest that newly synthesized apoB100 traverses at a relatively slow rate through cis/medial Golgi but transits rather rapidly through distal Golgi. To determine which Nycodenz fraction(s) contained VLDL, we analyzed the buoyancy of lipoproteins containing apoB100 within the lumenal of pooled ER (fractions 9–15), cis/medial Golgi (fractions 4–8), and distal"

In contrast, we have shown previously that exposure to oxidative stress in the form of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activated the EGF receptor but that the levels of activated receptors did not decline, which resulted in prolonged receptor signaling. This study provides mechanistic insights into these different modes of EGF receptor activation. Here we demonstrate that the pattern of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation induced by H2O2differs from that induced by its ligand, EGF. Importantly, H2O2 generates a receptor with negligible phosphorylation at tyrosine 1045, the major docking site for the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl. As a result, H2O2-activated receptors fail to recruit c-Cbl and do not undergo ubiquitination and endocytosis. In summary, H2O2 stimulation results in an activated receptor uncoupled from normal down-regulation, a process that may contribute to oxidant-mediated tumorigenesis.

Activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 receptor by its ligands is followed by desensitization processes initiated by ligand binding, which entails removal of the activated receptors from the cell surface (“down-regulation”) (1Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Interaction of the receptor with the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl has been shown to be essential for efficient receptor down-regulation (2Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Recently this interaction has also been shown to depend upon receptor phosphorylation at tyrosine 1045, the major docking site for c-Cbl (3Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M.

Following interaction, c-Cbl is phosphorylated by the EGF receptor, resulting in the activation of the ubiquitin ligase activity of c-Cbl.

Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) have shown that c-Cbl additionally regulates EGF receptor endocytosis by engaging the formation of multiprotein “endocytotic complex” with activated EGF receptors at the plasma membrane, thus controlling receptor internalization. Hence, the recruitment of c-Cbl to the EGF receptor has surfaced as a critical step in receptor down-regulation. By mediating receptor endocytosis and “tagging” it with ubiquitin molecules, c-Cbl increases the affinity of the receptor for the lysosomal and/or proteasomal degradation.Several studies indicate that the oncogenic action of the EGF receptor correlates with its overexpression at the plasma membrane (8Eccles S.A. Modjtahedi H. Box G. Court W. Sandle J. Dean C.J. Invasion Metastasis. 1994; 14: 337-348PubMed Google Scholar, 9Franklin W.A. Veve R. Hirsch F.R. Helfrich B.A. Bunn Jr., P.A. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Therefore, removal of activated receptor molecules from the cell surface by sorting for degradation is expected to inhibit their oncogenic potential. We and others have shown previously (10Gamou S. Shimizu N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 11Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Matsukuma K. Chea V. Gould R. Last J. Chan C. Chavez C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) that exposure to oxidative stress in the form of H2O2 preferentially enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. However, this aberrant EGF receptor phosphorylation does not enhance receptor turnover rate (11Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Matsukuma K. Chea V. Gould R. Last J. Chan C. Chavez C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of EGF receptor by oxidants was shown to coincide with enhanced cell proliferation (12Van Winkle L.S. Isaac J.M. Plopper C.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 443-459PubMed Google Scholar) and to facilitate tumor promotion processes (13Huang R.P. Peng A. Golard A. Hossain M.Z. Huang R. Liu Y.G. Boynton A.L. Mol. Carcinog. 2001; 30: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, the accumulation of activated EGF receptor during oxidative stress may provide the trigger for cell hyperplasia. Yet, the molecular mechanisms that link oxidative stress, EGF receptor signaling, and tumorigenic responses are poorly understood.We hypothesized that H2O2 could affect signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation by enhancing receptor phosphorylation without subsequent down-regulation. We suggested, as a possible mechanism, that activation of the EGF receptor under oxidative stress might fail to stimulate c-Cbl-mediated down-regulation. To test this hypothesis, we utilized an enzymatic reaction, namely the conversion of glucose to gluconolactone and H2O2 by glucose oxidase (GO), as a source for H2O2 generation, and we examined EGF receptor stability, ubiquitination, and the association with c-Cbl as determinants for receptor down-regulation. The results we present indicate that although the EGF receptor is tyrosine-phosphorylated under oxidative stress, phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 1045 is insignificant and therefore fails to initiate c-Cbl-mediated receptor internalization and degradation. This emerging role of H2O2 in EGF receptor signaling may also be relevant to other receptor tyrosine kinases that similarly undergo c-Cbl mediated down-regulation, and it is currently under investigation.DISCUSSIONWe have shown previously (11Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Matsukuma K. Chea V. Gould R. Last J. Chan C. Chavez C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) that EGF receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling are targeted by oxidative stress. In the present study we proceed to provide mechanistic insights into these observations. To activate the EGF receptor, we utilized the enzymatic reaction of glucose oxidation by GO, because it has been shown to allow continuous production of H2O2 (21Tirosh A. Potashnik R. Bashan N. Rudich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10595-10602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In addition, unlike some studies by others that used high levels of H2O2 for the activation of the EGF receptor, tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor by GO was clearly observed at ∼300 μm H2O2 or even lower levels (Fig. 1A), which are more relevant physiologically. Our findings that EGF receptor activation by GO is dependent on the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor and is inhibited by catalase (Fig. 1, A and C) support our previous conclusions that EGF receptor activation by H2O2 is tyrosine kinase-dependent (11Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Matsukuma K. Chea V. Gould R. Last J. Chan C. Chavez C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and further substantiates GO treatments as a mode of exposure to H2O2. In addition, the inhibition of EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation by PP1, observed during exposures to H2O2 and EGF (Fig. 1C), implies that similar to EGF, H2O2 also has the capability to activate Src family tyrosine kinases.In the current study we have shown that oxidative stress conferred prolonged EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and suggested that the failure of activated receptors to stimulate c-Cbl-mediated down-regulation accounts for this observation. Several lines of evidence support our model for EGF receptor activation under oxidative stress (Fig. 7). First, we demonstrated by confocal microscopy that, in contrast to EGF-treated cells, the EGF receptor remains at the plasma membrane during exposure to H2O2, and it is not translocated to vesicular compartments (Fig. 2). This was complemented by our findings that even though both the EGF receptor and c-Cbl are activated during oxidative stress (Figs. 1 and 4B), c-Cbl is not being translocated to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5). The recruitment of c-Cbl to the EGF receptor at the plasma membrane was recently shown to be a major regulatory step for receptor ubiquitination and internalization. de Melker et al. (6de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Calafat J. Jansen H. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that c-Cbl associates and ubiquitinates activated EGF receptor at the plasma membrane prior to receptor recruitment into clathrin-coated pits, and they concluded that c-Cbl has a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of EGF receptor as well as in intracellular sorting. In addition, a direct role for c-Cbl in endocytosis has been recently shown by Soubeyranet al. (7Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that c-Cbl recruits CIN85 (Cbl-interacting protein of 85,000) and endophilins (regulatory components of clathrin-coated vesicles) to form a complex with activated EGF receptors and that inhibition of this interaction is sufficient to block EGF receptor internalization. The results of our present studies are consistent with such a role for c-Cbl in endocytosis and intracellular sorting. Our data imply that the failure of activated EGF receptor to recruit c-Cbl during oxidative stress (Figs. 4 and 5) is the basis for its retention at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2) and for its aberrant down-regulation (Fig. 3), which results in prolonged duration of receptor signaling (Fig. 4).Additional support for this model (see Fig. 7) is provided in recent studies by Yarden and co-workers (3Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 22Waterman H. Katz M. Rubin C. Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that a mutant EGF receptor, whose tyrosine 1045 was changed to phenylalanine (Y1045F), lost its ability to undergo ubiquitination (3Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) and therefore resides at the plasma membrane upon induction with EGF (22Waterman H. Katz M. Rubin C. Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In an analogy to the tyrosine 1045 mutant, we have shown that activation of EGF receptor by oxidative stress fails to phosphorylate tyrosine 1045, while enhancing the phosphorylation of other tyrosine residues, such as tyrosines 845, 1068, and 1173. Therefore, H2O2exposure may cause a distribution of tyrosine phosphorylation sites similar to that of the mutant receptor (Y1045F). In both cases tyrosine 1045 is not phosphorylated, and the receptor is defective in endocytosis and ubiquitination. Thus, upon H2O2activation, the receptor becomes aberrantly phosphorylated and therefore is incapable of recruiting c-Cbl. This in turn confers longer receptor signaling capacity.The failure of activated EGF receptors to be degraded in a ubiquitin-mediated fashion is an uncommon response to H2O2, counteracting the general notion that oxidative stress results in rapid removal of oxidized proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (23Cooper K.F. Mallory M.J. Strich R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3338-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Shang F. Gong X. Taylor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23086-23093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 25Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Cohen G. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 65-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the same time, our data cannot exclude the possibility that the ubiquitin machinery by itself may be targeted by H2O2, as suggested by De Witet al. (26De Wit R. Makkinje M. Boonstra J. Verkleij A.J. Post J.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Yet the short time intervals of exposures to GO, the low doses of H2O2 production, and more importantly, the notion that c-Cbl recruitment to the EGF receptor precedes receptor ubiquitination suggest that the failure of activated receptors to recruit c-Cbl, rather than a general inhibition of protein ubiquitination, is the basis for receptor stabilization at the plasma membrane and for the prolonged duration of EGF receptor signaling.It has been known for many years that the majority of activated EGF receptors are located in endosomes (27Haigler H.T. McKanna J.A. Cohen S. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 81: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, the data presented here suggest that during oxidative stress the majority of activated receptors reside at the plasma membrane. The differences in localization may have implications in both the magnitude of the EGF receptor response and its outcome (28Wiley H.S. Burke P.M. Traffic. 2001; 2: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). For example, it has been proposed that short duration of growth factor-mediated signaling will promote proliferation of PC12 cells, whereas prolonged signaling leads to differentiation (29Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that preventing EGF receptor down-regulation facilitates cell proliferation and transformation (2Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 22Waterman H. Katz M. Rubin C. Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 30Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). This provides strong evidence that receptor down-regulation is important for the mechanism regulating EGF receptor responses. Therefore, our data showing that exposure to H2O2 elicits delayed EGF receptor activation with prolonged duration at the plasma membrane offer additional support to H2O2 oncogenic ability, which had been demonstrated to be EGF receptor-dependent (13Huang R.P. Peng A. Golard A. Hossain M.Z. Huang R. Liu Y.G. Boynton A.L. Mol. Carcinog. 2001; 30: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).In summary, the results of this study demonstrate that exposure of cells to H2O2-mediated oxidative stress enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor without being accompanied by receptor down-regulation (Fig. 7). Such exposures create an irregular EGF receptor activation pattern, the essence of which is a failure of the activated receptors to promote c-Cbl recruitment, due to insufficient tyrosine phosphorylation at residue 1045. These findings fit well with the paradigm suggesting that the oncogenic action of the EGF receptor depends on its accumulation at the plasma membrane and may implicate the phosphorylation of tyrosine 1045 as a target for cancer prevention during exposures to oxidative stress. Down-regulation of activated receptors is crucial for normal cell development and maintenance. Activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 receptor by its ligands is followed by desensitization processes initiated by ligand binding, which entails removal of the activated receptors from the cell surface (“down-regulation”) (1Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Interaction of the receptor with the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl has been shown to be essential for efficient receptor down-regulation (2Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Recently this interaction has also been shown to depend upon receptor phosphorylation at tyrosine 1045, the major docking site for c-Cbl (3Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M.

Following interaction, c-Cbl is phosphorylated by the EGF receptor, resulting in the activation of the ubiquitin ligase activity of c-Cbl.

The recruitment of c-Cbl to the EGF receptor at the plasma membrane was recently shown to be a major regulatory step for receptor ubiquitination and internalization. de Melker et al. (6de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Calafat J. Jansen H. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that c-Cbl associates and ubiquitinates activated EGF receptor at the plasma membrane prior to receptor recruitment into clathrin-coated pits, and they concluded that c-Cbl has a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of EGF receptor as well as in intracellular sorting. In addition, a direct role for c-Cbl in endocytosis has been recently shown by Soubeyranet al. (7Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that c-Cbl recruits CIN85 (Cbl-interacting protein of 85,000) and endophilins (regulatory components of clathrin-coated vesicles) to form a complex with activated EGF receptors and that inhibition of this interaction is sufficient to block EGF receptor internalization. The results of our present studies are consistent with such a role for c-Cbl in endocytosis and intracellular sorting. Our data imply that the failure of activated EGF receptor to recruit c-Cbl during oxidative stress (Figs. 4 and 5) is the basis for its retention at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2) and for its aberrant down-regulation (Fig. 3), which results in prolonged duration of receptor signaling (Fig. 4).Additional support for this model (see Fig. 7) is provided in recent studies by Yarden and co-workers (3Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol.

Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol.

Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In an analogy to the tyrosine 1045 mutant, we have shown that activation of EGF receptor by oxidative stress fails to phosphorylate tyrosine 1045, while enhancing the phosphorylation of other tyrosine residues, such as tyrosines 845, 1068, and 1173. Therefore, H2O2exposure may cause a distribution of tyrosine phosphorylation sites similar to that of the mutant receptor (Y1045F). In both cases tyrosine 1045 is not phosphorylated, and the receptor is defective in endocytosis and ubiquitination. Thus, upon H2O2activation, the receptor becomes aberrantly phosphorylated and therefore is incapable of recruiting c-Cbl. This in turn confers longer receptor signaling capacity.The failure of activated EGF receptors to be degraded in a ubiquitin-mediated fashion is an uncommon response to H2O2, counteracting the general notion that oxidative stress results in rapid removal of oxidized proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (23Cooper K.F. Mallory M.J. Strich R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3338-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Shang F. Gong X. Taylor A. J. Biol.

At the same time, our data cannot exclude the possibility that the ubiquitin machinery by itself may be targeted by H2O2, as suggested by De Witet al. (26De Wit R. Makkinje M. Boonstra J. Verkleij A.J. Post J.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Yet the short time intervals of exposures to GO, the low doses of H2O2 production, and more importantly, the notion that c-Cbl recruitment to the EGF receptor precedes receptor ubiquitination suggest that the failure of activated receptors to recruit c-Cbl, rather than a general inhibition of protein ubiquitination, is the basis for receptor stabilization at the plasma membrane and for the prolonged duration of EGF receptor signaling.It has been known for many years that the majority of activated EGF receptors are located in endosomes (27Haigler H.T. McKanna J.A. Cohen S. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 81: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, the data presented here suggest that during oxidative stress the majority of activated receptors reside at the plasma membrane. The differences in localization may have implications in both the magnitude of the EGF receptor response and its outcome (28Wiley H.S. Burke P.M. Traffic. 2001; 2: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). For example, it has been proposed that short duration of growth factor-mediated signaling will promote proliferation of PC12 cells, whereas prolonged signaling leads to differentiation (29Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that preventing EGF receptor down-regulation facilitates cell proliferation and transformation (2Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 22Waterman H. Katz M. Rubin C. Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y.

This provides strong evidence that receptor down-regulation is important for the mechanism regulating EGF receptor responses. Therefore, our data showing that exposure to H2O2 elicits delayed EGF receptor activation with prolonged duration at the plasma membrane offer additional support to H2O2 oncogenic ability, which had been demonstrated to be EGF receptor-dependent (13Huang R.P. Peng A. Golard A. Hossain M.Z. Huang R. Liu Y.G. Boynton A.L. Mol. Carcinog. 2001; 30: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).In summary, the results of this study demonstrate that exposure of cells to H2O2-mediated oxidative stress enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor without being accompanied by receptor down-regulation (Fig. 7). Such exposures create an irregular EGF receptor activation pattern, the essence of which is a failure of the activated receptors to promote c-Cbl recruitment, due to insufficient tyrosine phosphorylation at residue 1045. These findings fit well with the paradigm suggesting that the oncogenic action of the EGF receptor depends on its accumulation at the plasma membrane and may implicate the phosphorylation of tyrosine 1045 as a target for cancer prevention during exposures to oxidative stress. We have shown previously (11Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Matsukuma K. Chea V. Gould R. Last J. Chan C. Chavez C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) that EGF receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling are targeted by oxidative stress. In the present study we proceed to provide mechanistic insights into these observations. To activate the EGF receptor, we utilized the enzymatic reaction of glucose oxidation by GO, because it has been shown to allow continuous production of H2O2 (21Tirosh A. Potashnik R. Bashan N. Rudich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10595-10602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In addition, unlike some studies by others that used high levels of H2O2 for the activation of the EGF receptor, tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor by GO was clearly observed at ∼300 μm H2O2 or even lower levels (Fig. 1A), which are more relevant physiologically. Our findings that EGF receptor activation by GO is dependent on the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor and is inhibited by catalase (Fig. 1, A and C) support our previous conclusions that EGF receptor activation by H2O2 is tyrosine kinase-dependent (11Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Matsukuma K. Chea V. Gould R. Last J. Chan C. Chavez C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and further substantiates GO treatments as a mode of exposure to H2O2. In addition, the inhibition of EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation by PP1, observed during exposures to H2O2 and EGF (Fig. 1C), implies that similar to EGF, H2O2 also has the capability to activate Src family tyrosine kinases. In the current study we have shown that oxidative stress conferred prolonged EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and suggested that the failure of activated receptors to stimulate c-Cbl-mediated down-regulation accounts for this observation. Several lines of evidence support our model for EGF receptor activation under oxidative stress (Fig. 7). First, we demonstrated by confocal microscopy that, in contrast to EGF-treated cells, the EGF receptor remains at the plasma membrane during exposure to H2O2, and it is not translocated to vesicular compartments (Fig. 2). This was complemented by our findings that even though both the EGF receptor and c-Cbl are activated during oxidative stress (Figs. 1 and 4B), c-Cbl is not being translocated to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5).

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Nup2p also contains a low affinity binding site for Gsp1p-GTP at its C terminus (30Dingwall C.

Electron microscopic studies have localized Nup2p to the nuclear basket structure of the NPC where it binds directly to Nup60p in a Gsp1p-GTP-sensitive manner (27Solsbacher J. Maurer P. Vogel F.

At this location, Nup2p is proposed to function in the termination of import reactions involving the Kap95p·Kap60p heterodimer and the initiation of Kap60p export (7Gilchrist D. Mykytka B. Rexach M.

In this study, we employ a variety of biophysical methods to examine the physical and structural characteristics of the nucleoporin Nup2p as a model for nucleoporin structure. From these studies, we have concluded that Nup2p is a natively unfolded protein. We speculate that the intrinsic disorder of Nup2p is important for its functions, as it may facilitate rapid association and dissociation reactions with Kaps while allowing simultaneous interactions with binding partners such as Nup60p, Gsp1p, and Prp20p. GPY60 yeast were grown in 1 liter of YPD medium at 30 °C to an A600= 2.0. Yeast were harvested by sedimentation at 5,000 ×g for 10 min and resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 250 mm sorbitol, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin) to a final volume of 40 ml. Yeast were lysed in a French Press cell and cell debris was removed by sedimentation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was desalted in a Sephadex G-25 fine column (AmershamBiosciences) pre-equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2. Pooled fractions were supplemented with 0.1% Tween, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Recombinant Nups and Kaps were expressed asglutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions using vector pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences) that incorporates a thrombin cleavage site at the fusion junction. The NUP2, KAP60, KAP95 genes and portions of NUP2 were amplified from yeast genomic DNA (Promega) by PCR. The PCR products were ligated into vector pGEX-2TK and transformed into BL21 codon plusEscherichia coli (Novagen). E. coli were grown in 1 liter of 2× YT medium with ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) and 2% glucose at 37 °C to A600 = 1.0. Protein production was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 15 min to 2 h at 24 °C. E. coli were sedimented and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol) with protease inhibitors (0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were lysed in a French press (SLM Instruments), cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and Tween 20 (0.1%) was added to the supernatant. Recombinant GST-fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The GST moiety was cleaved off by incubation with thrombin (Calbiochem) at 25 °C (1 NIH unit of thrombin, 100 μg of GST fusion) for controlled times. A molar excess of hirudin (Calbiochem) was added to neutralize thrombin, and free GST was removed using glutathione-Sepharose beads. Proteins were further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography in gel filtration columns equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 2 mmMg(OAc)2. Purified proteins were resolved in a Superose-6 gel filtration column (AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, and 2 mm Mg(OAc)2 using the AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (AmershamBiosciences). The elution volumes (Ve) of proteins were determined by UV absorbance and/or collection of 0.5-ml fractions followed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad). The Stokes radius (RS) of Nup2p with and without bound Kaps was calculated using the method of Porath (33Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). Briefly, theVe of four standard proteins (aldolase, 48.1 Å; catalase, 52.2 Å; ferritin, 61.0 Å; and thyroglobulin, 85.0 Å) were plotted in relation to their Stokes radii, allowing for estimation of the Nup2p RS from the resulting linear regression. Linear sucrose gradients (5–20 or 10–40% sucrose) were poured using a gradient mixer (Hoefer) and recombinant Nup2p (5 μg), with or without recombinant Kap95p and/or Kap60p (5 μg each), was layered on top. Tubes were subjected to centrifugation at 259,000 × g for 15 h (5–20% sucrose gradients) or 24 h (10–40% sucrose gradients) at 4 °C in a TLS-55 rotor (Beckman). Eighteen fractions were collected from the top of each gradient. Purified BSA (4.7 S), aldolase (7.5 S), and catalase (11.3 S) were used in parallel gradients as size standards. Proteins in each fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Blue. Sedimentation coefficients (s20,w) were calculated by the method of McEwen (34McEwen C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 20: 114-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) using integration tables and the predicted specific volumes of Nup2p, Kap95p, and Kap60p. Molecular weight estimates for Nup2p and Nup2p-containing complexes were calculated as described (33Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). Calculations were based on experimentally determined Stokes radii and s20,w values and were calculated using the following equation, Mr=Rs·s20·w·6πη0N(1−·υρp)Equation 1 where η0 is the viscosity of the solvent (g/cm·s); ρ, the density of the solvent (g/cm3); ν, the partial specific volume of the protein (cm3/g); andn, Avogadro’s number. Far-UV CD spectra of purified Nup2p and Nup2p fragments were obtained on AVIV 60 DS and AVIV 62A DS spectrophotometers (Lakewood, NJ). Spectra were recorded using 0.1- or 0.01-cm cuvettes from 250 to 190 nm with a step size of 1 nm and an averaging time of 10 s. For all spectra, an average of three scans was obtained, and the background spectra of the buffer was removed. Attenuated total reflectance data were collected on a Nicolet 800SX FTIR spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector. The IREC (72 × 10 × 6 mm, 45° germanium trapezoid) was held in a modified SPECAC out-of-compartment attenuated total reflectance apparatus. The hydrated thin films were prepared as described previously (35Oberg K. Chrunyk B.A. Wetzel R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2628-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 36Oberg K.A. Fink A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 92-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Typically 1024 interferograms were co-added at 4 cm−1 resolution. Data analysis was performed with GRAMS32 (Galactic Industries). Secondary structure content was determined from curve fitting to spectra deconvoluted using second derivatives and Fourier self-deconvolution to identify component band positions. Hydrated thin films were prepared by drying 50 μl of 1 mg/ml Nup2p solution in 50 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, on a germanium crystal with dry N2. The IR spectra were collected, followed by Fourier transformation using the spectrum of the clean crystal as a background. Background water (liquid and vapor) components were subtracted from the protein spectrum. Recombinant Nup2p and/or recombinant Kap95p and Kap60p were digested in solution with 100 ng/ml proteinase K (Sigma) at 37 °C. At various time points, aliquots were removed and mixed with Laemmli sample buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) to stop proteolysis. Samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue to detect the products of proteinase K digestion. For protease digestion of native Nup2p in the context of intact NPCs, yeast nuclei were purified as described (37Aris J.P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 735-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and resuspended to 3.6 mg/ml in 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 250 mm sorbitol, 2 mm MgOAc, 50% glycerol. Proteinase K (Sigma) was added to the nuclei at 300 ng/ml. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots were removed at the indicated time points. Digestions were stopped with 2× Laemmli sample buffer plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. The fraction of full-length Nups remaining was quantified by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-Nup antibodies and 125I-Protein A (Amersham Biosciences). Radioactive blots were exposed to phosphorscreens and then digitized and quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-Nup2p antibodies were generated as described previously (31). Anti-Kap95p, -Kap60p, -Nup85p, and -Pom152p rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against Kap95p (full-length), Kap60p (full-length), Nup85p (full-length), and Pom152p (AA 210–533 and AA 1182–1337). The S. cerevisiae NPC is formed by 30 different Nups that are present in multiple copies per NPC (5Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Cryoelectron microscopy images of purified NPCs and immuno-EM studies have illustrated the overall architecture and assembly of the NPC as well as the regional localization of individual Nups within each NPC (4Yang Q. Rout M.P. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 223-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 5Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the structure of individual Nups. The experiments described below provide a detailed physical and structural characterization of the yeast nucleoporin Nup2p. As a part of our ongoing biochemical investigations into the mechanism of Kap95p (importin β/karyopherin β) movement across the yeast NPC, we incubated S. cerevisiae extract with a GST-Kap95p affinity resin to isolate specific Kap95p-interacting proteins. Among the most abundant proteins that eluted with 250 mm MgCl2was the nucleoporin Nup2p (Fig.1A, lane 2). Nup2p is a member of the FxFG family of nucleoporins and is tethered primarily to Nup60p in the nuclear basket structure of the NPC (31Denning D. Mykytka B. Allen N. Huang L. Burlingame A. Rexach M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,32Dilworth D.J. Suprapto A. Padovan J.C. Chait B.T. Wozniack R.W., M.P, R. Aitchison J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153 (. P.

Aitchison J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153 (. P. R.): 1465-1478MCrossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A second chromatography step was sufficient to obtain purified Nup2p in complex with its binding partner Kap60p (data not shown). Briefly, the MgCl2 eluate from the GST-Kap95p affinity resin was separated by gel filtration in a Superose-6 column equilibrated in physiological buffer. Nup2p co-purified with Kap60p, and no additional proteins were visible in the same fractions as detected by Coomassie stain (data not shown). To purify Nup2p to homogeneity without Kap60p, the GST-Kap95p eluate was applied to a Superose 6 column equilibrated in buffer with 250 mm MgCl2. Under such conditions, Nup2p that eluted from the Superose-6 column was pure as verified by Coomassie (Fig. 1A, lane 3) and silver stains (data not shown). Purified Nup2p eluted from the Superose 6 gel filtration column (24 ml bed volume) at elution volumes (Ve) from 9.25 to 10.75 ml (data not shown). We calculated the RS of Nup2p via the method of Porath (33Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar), using globular proteins with known hydrodynamic dimensions (aldolase, 48.1 Å; catalase, 52.2 Å; ferritin, 61.0 Å; and thyroglobulin, 85.0 Å) as standards. The calculatedRS of 101 Å for purified yeast Nup2p was unexpectedly large for a protein with a molecular weight of 78,000 (Table I); in comparison, the RS of BSA, a monomeric protein with a similar molecular weight (66,000), is only 35.5 Å. The presence of Kap60p in complex with Nup2p altered slightly the Veof Nup2p (data not shown), resulting in a smaller RSof 97 Å (Table I).Table IStokes radii (Rs) and sedimentation coefficients (s20.w) of Nup2p complexesProtein/complexPredictedM1-aPredicted molecular weight if all proteins present in a single copy.Stokes radius, Rs(Å) ± 5%1-bEstimated error.Sedimentation coefficient, s20.w (x10−13 s−1) ± 7%1-bEstimated error.Calculated M1-cMolecular weight calculated from Rs ands20.w values as described under “Materials and Methods.”Nup2p1-dPurified recombinant protein.78792.989Nup2p · Kap60p1-dPurified recombinant protein.138794.8149Nup2p · Kap95p1-dPurified recombinant protein.173766.2183Nup2p · Kap95p · Kap60p1-dPurified recombinant protein.233767.1221Nup2p1-ePurified from yeast extract.78101Nup2p · Kap60p1-ePurified from yeast extract.138971-a Predicted molecular weight if all proteins present in a single copy.1-b Estimated error.1-c Molecular weight calculated from Rs ands20.w values as described under “Materials and Methods.”1-d Purified recombinant protein.1-e Purified from yeast extract. Open table in a new tab Purified recombinant Nup2p produced in E. coli also possessed an unexpectedly large Stokes radius of 79 Å in the Superose 6 column (Fig. 1B, top panel; Table I). The addition of equimolar concentrations of Nup2p binding partners (Kap60p and Kap95p) yielded no significant changes in the elution volumes of Nup2p in Nup2p·Kap complexes versus Nup2p alone (Fig. 1B, bottom panels; Table I). It is unclear why the recombinant Nup2p produced in E. coliexhibits a smaller Stokes radius than the Nup2p purified from yeast. Post-translational modifications of Nup2p in S. cerevisiaehave not been reported, but sulfation or phosphorylation may account for the difference. However, recombinant and endogenous Nup2p migrate identically in SDS-acrylamide gels (data not shown). It is also possible that structural differences may result from the different purification procedures or the presence of a 9-AA tag at the N terminus of the recombinant Nup2p. Regardless, recombinant and native Nup2p behave identically in their ability to bind Kap60p and Kap95p (Figs. 1and 2; data not shown), suggesting that the two versions of Nup2p were functionally identical. The large hydrodynamic dimension of Nup2p is consistent with either (i) a homo-oligomeric assembly of Nup2p or (ii) a nonglobular structure of low compactness (38Uversky V.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1-10Crossref Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 39Dunker A.K. Lawson J.D. Brown C.J. Williams R.M. Romero P., Oh, J.S. Oldfield C.J. Campen A.M. Ratliff C.M. Hipps K.W. Ausio J.

Sedimentation velocity experiments also provide information regarding the mass, size, and degree of compactness of proteins or protein complexes. To calculate the sedimentation coefficient of Nup2p, recombinant Nup2p with and without its Kap binding partners was layered on linear sucrose gradients (5–20 or 10–40%) and subjected to centrifugation at 259,000 ×g (Figs. 2, A and B). Table I lists the sedimentation coefficients (s20,w) for Nup2p and several Nup2p complexes. The s20,w values were calculated using the method of McEwen (34McEwen C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 20: 114-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and the sedimentation of Nup2p was compared with several standard proteins: BSA (4.7 S/66 kDa), aldolase (7.5 S/160 kDa), and catalase (11.3 S/240 kDa) (Fig. 2; data not shown). Note that despite the large hydrodynamic dimensions of Nup2p (79 Å) in gel filtration columns, purified Nup2p sediments as a 2.9 S particle, which was significantly slower than BSA (4.7 S/66 kDa) (Fig. 2A, top panel). In contrast, the addition of Kap60p or Kap95p caused the resulting Nup2p·Kap complex to sediment more rapidly with s20,w values of 4.8 and 6.2 S, respectively (Fig. 2A, middle panels; Table I). As expected, the trimeric Nup2p· Kap95p·Kap60p complex sediments even faster (7.1 S) (Fig. 2, A, bottom panel, and B, bottom panel; Table I) and was comparable with the sedimentation of Nup2p in yeast extracts (Fig.2B, top panel). The changes in Nup2p sedimentation caused by Kap95p and/or Kap60p are reasonable considering the known masses and shapes of Kap95p and Kap60p monomers (40Conti E., Uy, M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 41Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The unexpectedly small sedimentation coefficient of purified Nup2p (2.9 S) was indicative of a low mass particle and/or of high drag forces that slow the migration of Nup2p through the sucrose gradient. Although high molecular weight protein complexes may also sediment slowly as a result of oligomeric arrangements that produce high drag forces, the sedimen"

We show that Drosophila FGF is used, only in males, to recruit mesodermal cells expressing its receptor to become part of the genital imaginal disc. Male-specific deployment of FGF signaling is controlled by the sex determination regulatory gene doublesex. The recruited mesodermal cells become epithelial and differentiate into parts of the internal genitalia. Our results provide exceptions to two basic tenets of imaginal disc biology-that imaginal disc cells are derived from the embryonic ectoderm and belong to either an anterior or posterior compartment.

Herein we show that inhibition of the aldehyde-metabolizing enzyme aldose reductase (AR) inhibits NF-κB activation during restenosis of balloon-injured rat carotid arteries as well as VSMC proliferation due to tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) stimulation. Inhibition of VSMC growth by AR inhibitors was not accompanied by increase in cell death or apoptosis. Inhibition of AR led to a decrease in the activity of the transcription factor NF-κB in culture and in the neointima of rat carotid arteries after balloon injury. Inhibition of AR in VSMC also prevented the activation of NF-κB by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), angiotensin-II (Ang-II), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-AB). The VSMC treated with AR inhibitors showed decreased nuclear translocation of NF-κB and diminished phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of IκB-α. Under identical conditions, treatment with AR inhibitors also prevented the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by TNF-α, bFGF, Ang-II, and PDGF-AB but not phorbol esters, indicating that AR inhibitors prevent PKC stimulation or the availability of its activator but not PKC itself. Treatment with antisense AR, which decreased the AR activity by >80%, attenuated PKC activation in TNF-α, bFGF, Ang-II, and PDGF-AB-stimulated VSMC and prevented TNF-α-induced proliferation. Collectively, these data suggest that inhibition of NF-κB may be a significant cause of the antimitogenic effects of AR inhibition and that this may be related to disruption of PKC-associated signaling in the AR-inhibited cells.

The substrates of the enzyme range from aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes to aldoses such as glucose, galactose, and ribose.

Together, these observations provide strong support to the view that AR protects against the toxicity of electrophilic aldehydes and their glutathione conjugates by reducing them to less toxic or metabolic inert alcohols.Although glucose is a poor substrate of AR, the enzyme is recruited in renal tissues to generate sorbitol for balancing the osmotic gap during diureseis (18Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The abundance and the transcription of the AR gene are dramatically enhanced by the activation of the transcription factor-TonE-binding protein (19Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S.

However, osmotic role of AR in nonrenal tissues is unclear, and the high expression of the enzyme in tissues such as heart, blood vessels, skeletal muscle, or brain suggests that the enzyme may be involved in processes other than osmoregulation and glucose metabolism. Recent evidence shows that in addition to osmotic or oxidative stress, AR and its homologs are also up-regulated by mitogenic stimuli. Stimulation of NIH 3T3 cells by FGF-1 (and to a lesser extent by FGF-2, epidermal growth factor, and phorbol esters) leads to a dramatic increase in the expression of an aldo-keto reductase, FR-1 (21Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Hampton B.S. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8604-8609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is related to AR in structure and function (21Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12909-12917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The AR protein itself is also increased by growth factors in the 3T3 fibroblasts (23Hsu D.K. Guo Y. Peifley K.A. Winkles J.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), astrocytes (24Jacquin-Becker C. Labourdette G.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although the quiescent VSMC of the tunica media do not express detectable levels of AR, the expression of the enzyme is markedly induced during vascular inflammation or growth (10Ruef J. Bode C. Rosani M. Runge M.S. Bhatnagar A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Rittner H.L. Hafner V. Klimiuk P.A. Szweda L.I. Goronzy J.J. Weyand C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have previously shown that inhibition of AR prevents serum-induced VSMC growth in culture and neointima formation in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries (10Ruef J. Bode C. Rosani M. Runge M.S. Bhatnagar A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the mitogenic events regulated by AR have not been identified, and the mechanism by which AR prevents VSMC growth remains unclear. We therefore examined the participation of AR in VSMC mitogenesis in response to TNF-α, which is the main mitogen driving neointima formation in vivo (25Rectenwald J.E. Moldawer L.L. Huber T.S. Seeger J.M. Ozaki K. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1697-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26Niemann-Jonsson A. Ares M.P. Yan Z.Q., Bu, D.X. Fredrikson G.N. Branen L. Porn-Ares I. Nilsson A.H. Nilsson J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1909-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and various growth factors.DISCUSSIONDespite its well studied role in diabetic complications, the physiological function of AR remains unclear. Extensive investigations show that AR is a broad specificity enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of a wide range of aldehydes. Its kinetic properties are optimized such that the energetics of substrate binding do not contribute to the overall catalytic efficiency of the enzyme (1Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1992; 48: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 6Srivastava S. Watowich S.J. Petrash J.M. Srivastava S.K. Bhatnagar A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As a result, AR does not display predominant specificity for a unique substrate-product pair; rather, it can reduce several types of aldehydes with nearly equal efficiency. Such behavior confers ideal properties to AR for the reduction of multiple aldehydes, such as the aldo-keto sugars and the aldehydes generated by lipid peroxidation (3Srivastava S. Chandra A. Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. Ansari N.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 4Vander Jagt D.L. Kolb N.S. Vander Jagt T.J. Chino J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12172-12180Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The broad substrate specificity of the enzyme precludes its ready implication in a unique metabolic pathway and suggests that it may be recruited for tissue-specific use under a variety of metabolic contexts.Additional insights into the physiological functions of the enzyme are provided by recent studies showing that AR is up-regulated during cell growth and proliferation (see Introduction). These observations suggest that AR is a growth-responsive protein and may be involved in facilitating metabolic changes that accompany growth. Consistent with this view, we have reported that the expression of the enzyme, while minimal in quiescent VSMC, is markedly enhanced in the neointima (10Ruef J. Bode C. Rosani M. Runge M.S. Bhatnagar A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A similar increase in the expression of AR was observed upon mitogenic stimulation of VSMC in culture. Moreover, we have shown that inhibition of the enzyme prevents VSMC growth in culture and decreases neointimal hyperplasia in balloon-injured carotid arteries. Hence, to further elucidate the role of this enzyme in VSMC growth, we examined changes in mitogenic signaling elicited by inhibition of AR.In view of the previous reports demonstrating a central role of NF-κB in VSMC growth (28Hoshi S. Goto M. Koyama N. Nomoto K. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 883-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 29Selzman C.H. Shames B.D. Reznikov L.L. Miller S.A. Meng X.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we examined whether treatment with AR inhibitors prevented the activation of this transcription factor in proliferating arterial lesions. As shown in Fig. 1, inhibition of AR was indeed found to significantly decrease the expression of activated NF-κB in restenotic vessels, indicating that inhibition of NF-κB-mediated signaling may be an important cause of the antimitogenic effects of these drugs. Furthermore, because NF-κB plays a central role in the development of the inflammatory response and AR is up-regulated by cytokines and inflammation, it appears likely that the interaction between AR and NF-κB may be a critical determinant of the inflammatory response. Additionally, since hyperglycemic injury during diabetes has been linked to the activation of NF-κB (37Ho E. Bray T.M. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 38Bierhaus A. Schiekofer S. Schwaninger M. Andrassy M. Humpert P.M. Chen J. Hong M. Luther T. Henle T. Kloting I. Morcos M. Hofmann M. Tritschler H. Weigle B. Kasper M. Smith M. Perry G. Schmidt A.M. Stern D.M. Haring H.U. Schleicher E. Nawroth P.P. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2792-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 39Golovchenko I. Goalstone M.L. Watson P. Brownlee M. Draznin B. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we speculate that the protective effects of AR inhibitors against diabetic complications may be related to the ability of inhibitors to inhibit NF-κB activation and resultant inflammation.The inhibitory effect of AR inhibition on NF-κB activation in situ was faithfully reproduced in culture. As reported before, we found that stimulation by TNF-α led to a pronounced activation of NF-κB in VSMC in culture, and this was accompanied by increased VSMC growth. Our observation that pretreatment with two structurally unrelated compounds (sorbinil and tolrestat) prevented the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB and cell growth suggests that AR may be an obligatory mediator of TNF-α-signaling. However, the observation that the activation of NF-κB by FGF, PDGF-AB, and Ang-II was also inhibited by the AR inhibitors suggests that the inhibition was not dependent on the nature of the initial trigger and that events downstream from receptor activation but proximal to NF-κB may be dependent on AR activity.To further identify the locus of inhibition, we examined signaling events upstream of NF-κB activation. Our results showing that IκB-α phosphorylation was abrogated by inhibiting AR suggest a possible involvement of a specific kinase that is responsible for phosphorylation of IκB-α. The results from Fig. 5 suggest that PKC may be a potential candidate for the activation of NF-κB through IκB-α phosphorylation, because inhibition of AR did not prevent PMA-induced NF-κB activation. Hence, we examined whether inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation was due to alterations in PKC signaling. Indeed, as demonstrated by our results shown in Fig. 7A, inhibition of AR prevented the activation of PKC, and as with NF-κB, the extent of inhibition was not significantly affected by the nature of the PKC activator, and comparable inhibition was observed when PKC was activated by either TNF-α, FGF, PDGF-AB, or Ang-II. Interestingly, the activation of PKC by PMA was also insensitive to sorbinil or tolrestat. These observations suggest that AR is essential for PKC activity. Furthermore, because the AR inhibitors did not affect the PMA-mediated activation of PKC, these results suggest that the anti-mitogenic effects of tolrestat and sorbinil are not due to their nonspecificity. This is further corroborated by experiments showing that antisense ablation of AR prevents PKC activation by TNF-α and growth factors but not PMA and that ablation of AR also inhibits TNF-α-induced growth.Several investigators have linked PKC activation to AR activity (36Nishikawa T. Edelstein D., Du, X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2090-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Both PKC and AR are coordinately up-regulated under similar conditions, and recent proteomic analysis shows that at least in the heart, PKC and AR are part of the same signaling complex. The AR dependence of PKC is not entirely clear. However, it has been suggested that AR activity is required for the synthesis of diacylglycerol, which is an obligatory cofactor for the activation of classical and novel PKC isoforms. This view is consistent with our observation that preincubation with AR inhibitors was essential for inhibiting both the PKC and NF-κB signaling, suggesting that the lack of AR activity imposes a metabolic deficiency that interferes with optimal activation of PKC.In conclusion, the most interesting and novel finding in the present study is that inhibition of AR activity by AR inhibitors or AR translation diminishes both the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB and the VSMC proliferation. The preventive effect of sorbinil on the TNF-α-induced hyperproliferation was comparable with that with the phosphorylation of IκB-α, indicating that the inhibitory action of AR inhibitor on the VSMC growth may be related to disruption of the NF-κB pathway. Our studies further indicate that the inhibition of NF-κB may be related to abrogation of PKC signaling and that AR-catalyzed reaction product(s) may be an obligatory requirement for the activation of PKC. Further evaluation of this pathway and assessment of its significance in cell growth will help in understanding the metabolic processes that underlie signaling events culminating in cell growth.

Rosani M. Runge M.S. Bhatnagar A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Rittner H.L. Hafner V. Klimiuk P.A. Szweda L.I. Goronzy J.J. Weyand C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have previously shown that inhibition of AR prevents serum-induced VSMC growth in culture and neointima formation in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries (10Ruef J. Bode C. Rosani M. Runge M.S. Bhatnagar A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the mitogenic events regulated by AR have not been identified, and the mechanism by which AR prevents VSMC growth remains unclear. We therefore examined the participation of AR in VSMC mitogenesis in response to TNF-α, which is the main mitogen driving neointima formation in vivo (25Rectenwald J.E. Moldawer L.L. Huber T.S.

DISCUSSIONDespite its well studied role in diabetic complications, the physiological function of AR remains unclear. Extensive investigations show that AR is a broad specificity enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of a wide range of aldehydes. Its kinetic properties are optimized such that the energetics of substrate binding do not contribute to the overall catalytic efficiency of the enzyme (1Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1992; 48: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 6Srivastava S. Watowich S.J. Petrash J.M. Srivastava S.K. Bhatnagar A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As a result, AR does not display predominant specificity for a unique substrate-product pair; rather, it can reduce several types of aldehydes with nearly equal efficiency. Such behavior confers ideal properties to AR for the reduction of multiple aldehydes, such as the aldo-keto sugars and the aldehydes generated by lipid peroxidation (3Srivastava S. Chandra A.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12172-12180Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The broad substrate specificity of the enzyme precludes its ready implication in a unique metabolic pathway and suggests that it may be recruited for tissue-specific use under a variety of metabolic contexts.Additional insights into the physiological functions of the enzyme are provided by recent studies showing that AR is up-regulated during cell growth and proliferation (see Introduction). These observations suggest that AR is a growth-responsive protein and may be involved in facilitating metabolic changes that accompany growth. Consistent with this view, we have reported that the expression of the enzyme, while minimal in quiescent VSMC, is markedly enhanced in the neointima (10Ruef J. Bode C. Rosani M. Runge M.S. Bhatnagar A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A similar increase in the expression of AR was observed upon mitogenic stimulation of VSMC in culture. Moreover, we have shown that inhibition of the enzyme prevents VSMC growth in culture and decreases neointimal hyperplasia in balloon-injured carotid arteries. Hence, to further elucidate the role of this enzyme in VSMC growth, we examined changes in mitogenic signaling elicited by inhibition of AR.In view of the previous reports demonstrating a central role of NF-κB in VSMC growth (28Hoshi S. Goto M. Koyama N. Nomoto K. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 883-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 29Selzman C.H. Shames B.D. Reznikov L.L. Miller S.A. Meng X.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we examined whether treatment with AR inhibitors prevented the activation of this transcription factor in proliferating arterial lesions. As shown in Fig. 1, inhibition of AR was indeed found to significantly decrease the expression of activated NF-κB in restenotic vessels, indicating that inhibition of NF-κB-mediated signaling may be an important cause of the antimitogenic effects of these drugs. Furthermore, because NF-κB plays a central role in the development of the inflammatory response and AR is up-regulated by cytokines and inflammation, it appears likely that the interaction between AR and NF-κB may be a critical determinant of the inflammatory response. Additionally, since hyperglycemic injury during diabetes has been linked to the activation of NF-κB (37Ho E. Bray T.M. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 38Bierhaus A. Schiekofer S. Schwaninger M. Andrassy M. Humpert P.M. Chen J. Hong M. Luther T. Henle T. Kloting I. Morcos M.

Res. 2000; 87: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we speculate that the protective effects of AR inhibitors against diabetic complications may be related to the ability of inhibitors to inhibit NF-κB activation and resultant inflammation.The inhibitory effect of AR inhibition on NF-κB activation in situ was faithfully reproduced in culture. As reported before, we found that stimulation by TNF-α led to a pronounced activation of NF-κB in VSMC in culture, and this was accompanied by increased VSMC growth. Our observation that pretreatment with two structurally unrelated compounds (sorbinil and tolrestat) prevented the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB and cell growth suggests that AR may be an obligatory mediator of TNF-α-signaling. However, the observation that the activation of NF-κB by FGF, PDGF-AB, and Ang-II was also inhibited by the AR inhibitors suggests that the inhibition was not dependent on the nature of the initial trigger and that events downstream from receptor activation but proximal to NF-κB may be dependent on AR activity.To further identify the locus of inhibition, we examined signaling events upstream of NF-κB activation. Our results showing that IκB-α phosphorylation was abrogated by inhibiting AR suggest a possible involvement of a specific kinase that is responsible for phosphorylation of IκB-α. The results from Fig. 5 suggest that PKC may be a potential candidate for the activation of NF-κB through IκB-α phosphorylation, because inhibition of AR did not prevent PMA-induced NF-κB activation. Hence, we examined whether inhibition of IκB-α phosphorylation was due to alterations in PKC signaling. Indeed, as demonstrated by our results shown in Fig. 7A, inhibition of AR prevented the activation of PKC, and as with NF-κB, the extent of inhibition was not significantly affected by the nature of the PKC activator, and comparable inhibition was observed when PKC was activated by either TNF-α, FGF, PDGF-AB, or Ang-II. Interestingly, the activation of PKC by PMA was also insensitive to sorbinil or tolrestat. These observations suggest that AR is essential for PKC activity. Furthermore, because the AR inhibitors did not affect the PMA-mediated activation of PKC, these results suggest that the anti-mitogenic effects of tolrestat and sorbinil are not due to their nonspecificity. This is further corroborated by experiments showing that antisense ablation of AR prevents PKC activation by TNF-α and growth factors but not PMA and that ablation of AR also inhibits TNF-α-induced growth.Several investigators have linked PKC activation to AR activity (36Nishikawa T.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2090-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Both PKC and AR are coordinately up-regulated under similar conditions, and recent proteomic analysis shows that at least in the heart, PKC and AR are part of the same signaling complex. The AR dependence of PKC is not entirely clear. However, it has been suggested that AR activity is required for the synthesis of diacylglycerol, which is an obligatory cofactor for the activation of classical and novel PKC isoforms. This view is consistent with our observation that preincubation with AR inhibitors was essential for inhibiting both the PKC and NF-κB signaling, suggesting that the lack of AR activity imposes a metabolic deficiency that interferes with optimal activation of PKC.In conclusion, the most interesting and novel finding in the present study is that inhibition of AR activity by AR inhibitors or AR translation diminishes both the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB and the VSMC proliferation. The preventive effect of sorbinil on the TNF-α-induced hyperproliferation was comparable with that with the phosphorylation of IκB-α, indicating that the inhibitory action of AR inhibitor on the VSMC growth may be related to disruption of the NF-κB pathway. Our studies further indicate that the inhibition of NF-κB may be related to abrogation of PKC signaling and that AR-catalyzed reaction product(s) may be an obligatory requirement for the activation of PKC. Further evaluation of this pathway and assessment of its significance in cell growth will help in understanding the metabolic processes that underlie signaling events culminating in cell growth.

https://openalex.org/W2050504460,"Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is one of the key enzymes of the gluconeogenic pathway. Although enzyme activity had been detected in Archaea, the corresponding gene had not been identified until a presumable inositol monophosphatase gene fromMethanococcus jannaschii was found to encode a protein with both inositol monophosphatase and FBPase activities. Here we display that a gene from the hyperthermophilic archaeon, Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1, which does not correspond to the inositol monophosphatase gene from M. jannaschii, displays high FBPase activity. The FBPase from strain KOD1 was partially purified, its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined, and the gene (Tk-fbp) was cloned. Tk-fbp encoded a protein of 375 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 41,658 Da. The recombinant Tk-Fbp was purified and characterized. Tk-Fbp catalyzed the conversion of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate following Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km value of 100 μm toward fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and akcat value of 17 s−1subunit−1 at 95 °C. Unlike the inositol monophosphatase from M. jannaschii, Tk-Fbp displayed strict substrate specificity for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Activity was enhanced by Mg2+ and dithioerythritol, and was slightly inhibited by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. AMP did not inhibit the enzyme activity. We examined whether expression of Tk-fbp was regulated at the transcription level. High levels of Tk-fbp transcripts were detected in cells grown on pyruvate or amino acids, whereas no transcription was detected when starch was present in the medium. Orthologue genes corresponding to Tk-fbp with high similarity are present in all the complete genome sequences of thermophilic Archaea, including M. jannaschii, Pyrococcus furiosus, Sulfolobus solfataricus,and Archaeoglobus fulgidus, but are yet to be assigned any function. Taking into account the high FBPase activity of the protein, the strict substrate specificity, and its sugar-repressed gene expression, we propose that Tk-Fbp may represent the bona fide FBPase in Archaea.

Although most enzymes are shared by the two pathways, fructose-6-phosphate kinase catalyzes the unidirectional phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in glycolysis. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (d-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphohydrolase, FBPase1; EC 3.1.3.11) catalyzes the reverse reaction in gluconeogenesis, the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) to fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) and inorganic phosphate (1Pilkis S.J.

The regulation of FBPase gene expression has been extensively studied in yeast, and is regarded as a typical example of glucose repression/derepression (12Meijer M.M. Boonstra J. Verkleij A.J. Verrips C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24102-24107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, gene transcription is repressed by the MIG1 repressor in the presence of glucose, and is derepressed in the absence of glucose via the SNF1/CAT8 regulation pathway (13Randez-Gil F. Bojunga N. Proft M. Entian K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2502-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Besides the regulation at the transcriptional level, FBPase is also known to be an allosteric enzyme (14Kelley-Loughnane N. Kantrowitz E.R. Proteins. 2001; 44: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). FBPases from bacteria, yeast, and mammals have been reported to be inhibited allosterically by AMP (15Carcamo J.G. Yanez A.J. Ludwig H.C. Leon O. Pinto R.O. Reyes A.M. Slebe J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2242-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Addition of AMP causes the enzyme to cooperatively shift from the fully active R-state (relaxed) to the inactive T-state (tense) (16Zhang Y. Liang J.Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate has also been found to inhibit FBPase activity as a substrate analog (17Pilkis S.J., El- Maghrabi M.R. Pilkis J. Claus T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3619-3622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of mammalian enzymes are 85% identical to each other, and are similar to the Class I FBPases in bacteria (3Kelley-Loughnane N. Biolsi S.A. Gibson K.M., Lu, G. Hehir M.J. Phelan P. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1594: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). InEscherichia coli, two FBPases have been identified. The Class I enzyme encoded by the fbp gene (Ec-Fbp) has been long recognized as the sole FBPase in E. coli (18Babul J. Guixe V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, a second FBPase encoded by the glpX gene (Ec-GlpX) has recently been identified (4Donahue J.L. Bownas J.L. Niehaus W.G. Larson T.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5624-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Ec-GlpX does not display structural similarity with Ec-Fbp, and has been classified as a Class II enzyme. A very divergent Class III FBPase has also been identified inBacillus subtilis (5Fujita Y. Yoshida K. Miwa Y. Yanai N. Nagakawa E. Kasahara Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4309-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli, disruption of the fbp gene led to a mutant that grew as well as the wild type strain on glucose or fructose, but could not grow on glycerol or other gluconeogenic substrates. In contrast, the glpXdisruptant strain did not display a particular phenotype. In the case of E. coli, the Class I Ec-Fbp is presumed to be the major enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis (4Donahue J.L. Bownas J.L. Niehaus W.G. Larson T.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5624-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In Archaea, the identification of FBPase has attracted much attention. This is because of the fact that although FBPase activity had been detected in cell extracts of several Archaea (19Fuchs G. Winter H. Steiner I. Stupperich E. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 136: 160-162Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Schäfer T. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 159: 354-363Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Stec B. Yang H. Johnson K.A. Chen L. Roberts M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1046-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Yu J.P. Ladapo J. Whitman W.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), orthologous genes with structural similarity to previously reported FBPases are not present on their genomes. This was resolved to some extent by the finding that the MJ0109 gene product from the archaeonMethanococcus jannaschii displayed FBPase activity (21Stec B. Yang H. Johnson K.A. Chen L. Roberts M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1046-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The gene had been assigned as an inositol monophosphatase gene, and the protein product was found to harbor both inositol monophosphatase and FBPase activities. No other protein with FBPase activity has been reported from Archaea. Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 is a hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated from Kodakara Island, Kagoshima, Japan (23Morikawa M. Izawa Y. Rashid N. Hoaki T. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 4559-4566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strain can grow with amino acids as a carbon and energy source and sulfur as the terminal electron acceptor. The cells can also assimilate starch or pyruvate, providing a good tool for studying gluconeogenesis and its regulation in Archaea. Here we report the FBPase from T. kodakaraensis KOD1, a structurally distinct enzyme from previously identified FBPases, including the MJ0109 gene product from M. jannaschii. T. kodakaraensis KOD1 was isolated from a solfataric hot spring at a wharf in Kodakara Island, Kagoshima, Japan (23Morikawa M. Izawa Y. Rashid N. Hoaki T. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 4559-4566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. colistrain DH5α was used for subcloning of the gene fragments and DNA manipulations. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used as a host and pET-8c vector (Novagen) was used for gene expression. Restriction enzymes and DNA polymerase were purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan) and Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). Genomic, plasmid and phage DNAs were isolated using Qiagen genomic, plasmid, and phage DNA isolation kits, respectively (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA ligations were performed using the DNA ligation kit (Toyobo). The QIAEX gel extraction kit (Qiagen) was used to recover DNA fragments from agarose gels. T. kodakaraensis KOD1 cells were cultivated in a medium containing pyruvate as a carbon source. After overnight cultivation, cells were harvested, resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and disrupted by sonication in ice water. All purification steps were performed at room temperature unless mentioned otherwise. Membrane and cytosolic fractions from the cell lysate were separated by ultracentrifugation at 110,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C. The cytosolic fraction exhibiting the FBPase activity was loaded on an anion exchange column (RESOURCE Q, Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The column was washed with 3 bed volumes of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and the bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1000 mm potassium chloride (pH 7.0). Fractions with FBPase activity were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The dialyzed sample was loaded onto another anion exchange column (Mono Q HR 5/5, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of equilibrated buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1000 mm potassium chloride (pH 7.0). Fractions displaying FBPase activity were dialyzed against 2 m ammonium sulfate. The dialyzed sample was applied onto a hydrophobic column (RESOURCE ISO,Amersham Biosciences) that was equilibrated with 2 mammonium sulfate in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The column was washed with 4 bed volumes of 2 mammonium sulfate in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and the bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 2–0m ammonium sulfate (pH 7.0). Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 150 mm sodium chloride (pH 7.0). The dialyzed sample was concentrated using Centricon YM-30 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The concentrated sample was further purified by gel filtration (Superdex 200 HR 10/30, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 150 mmsodium chloride (pH 7.0). Protein concentration was determined with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence, proteins after SDS-PAGE were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was stained with Amido Black solution (5% Amido Black, 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid) for 5 min. The membrane was de-stained and the N-terminal amino acid residues were determined with a protein sequencer (Model 491 cLC, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Probes were constructed using the digoxigenin DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). DNA sequencing was performed using ABI PRISM BigDyeTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequence analyses and data base homology search were performed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) program. Open reading frame search and molecular mass calculations were performed using DNASIS software (Hitachi Software, Yokohama, Japan). Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Clustal W program provided by the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). The Tk-fbpgene was amplified by PCR and a BamHI site was introduced in the 3′-flanking region of the gene. The DNA fragment was inserted into the pET-8c expression vector (Novagen) at NcoI and BamHI sites and designated pET-fbp. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells carrying pET-fbp were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, pH7.0) containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml). The culture was inoculated (1%) into fresh LB medium containing ampicillin and the cultivation was continued until A660 reached 0.5. The culture was then supplemented with 1 mm (final concentration) isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated for another 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The cell pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and the cells were then disrupted by sonication in ice water. Soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). The soluble fraction containing the recombinant Tk-Fbp was incubated at 85 °C for 20 min and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove heat-labile proteins from the host E. coli. The supernatant carrying Tk-Fbp was purified to homogeneity with the same methodology described above for the native Tk-Fbp. The purity of the protein was examined by SDS-PAGE. Apparent molecular mass of the purified protein was calculated by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. The void volume was determined with blue dextran, and a standard calibration curve was obtained using thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and albumin (67 kDa) (AmershamBiosciences). To detect FBPase activity during protein purification, a spectrophotometric coupled enzyme assay was employed to measure the enzyme activity. FBPase activity was coupled with phosphoglucose isomerase and NADP-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and NADPH formation was measured. Assay mixture (1 ml) contained: 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 0.4 mm NADP+, 20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm dithioerythritol, 0.5 units of phosphoglucose isomerase (Sigma), 0.5 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma), and 50 μl of protein sample. The reaction was initiated by adding 2 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The values obtained when glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was omitted from the reaction mixture were subtracted in each measurement. To determine the effects of temperature on enzyme activity, a reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 20 mm MgCl2, and 20 mmdithioerythritol was incubated at the desired temperature (37–100 °C) for 5 min. The FBPase reaction was initiated with the addition of enzyme and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and was incubated for 1 min. Product formation was proportional to incubation time under these conditions. A control experiment without Tk-Fbp was performed at each temperature. After the incubation, the assay mixture was cooled in ice water for 5 min and then the exogenous enzymes and cofactor were added to initiate the coupling reaction. Incubation was carried out at 25 °C for 3 min. Generation of NADPH was monitored at 340 nm. The reaction mixture without Tk-Fbp at each temperature was used as a blank value. When the effect of pH on enzyme activity was examined, the reaction was carried out in a reaction volume of 100 μl containing 20 mm of the following buffers: citrate buffer (pH 4.5 to 6.5), MES buffer (pH 6.0 to 7.5), and Tris buffer (pH 7.5 to 9.0). All buffers were prepared so that their pH would reflect accurate values at 95 °C. After the first reaction, 100 μl of 1 mTris-HCl (pH 8.0) was added to the reaction mixture to bring the pH of the reaction mixture to 8.0. For examination of the various metal ions effect on the enzyme activity, the first reaction mixture was incubated with the respective metal cations. After incubation the mixture was cooled in ice water and as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is a Mg2+-dependent enzyme, the coupling reaction was initiated by adding 20 mm Mg2+, NADP+, and the exogenous enzymes. Reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm dithioerythritol, 2 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and 12 μg of purified Tk-Fbp were incubated at 50 °C. Substrates other than fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, such as fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, and glucose 1-phosphate were also incubated under the same conditions. Samples, after incubation for the desired period of time, were kept on ice for 10 min. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 ×g and the supernatant was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with a Shodex Asahipak NH2P-50 4E column (Shodex, Tokyo, Japan). Sodium phosphate buffer (300 mm) at pH 4.4 was used as an eluent at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Column temperature was set at 40 °C and the product was detected with a refractive index detector. For isolation of RNA from strain KOD1, cells were harvested at the early log phase whenA660 was ∼0.1. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen). For Northern blot analysis, 15 μg of total RNA was denatured by heat treatment at 65 °C for 15 min, separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nylon membrane (HybondTM-N+; Amersham Biosciences) by capillary blotting. Digoxigenin labeling of DNA fragments, hybridization, and washing of the membranes were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A DNA fragment corresponding to the entire Tk-fbp coding region was used as a probe. A 1.5-kilobase pair region within the coding region of the DNA ligase gene from strain KOD1 (24Nakatani M. Ezaki S. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6424-6433Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was also used as a probe. T. kodakaraensisKOD1 cells were grown on pyruvate (1%) in the presence of 0.5% yeast extract and 0.5% tryptone. Under these growth conditions, gluconeogenesis was required to supply the necessary sugars for cell proliferation. FBPase activity was investigated in these cells. We detected FBPase activity in the cell extracts with a specific activity of 0.4 units/mg at 95 °C. We partially purified the FBPase from the cell extracts of pyruvate-grown cells. FBPase was purified 13-fold by anion exchange, hydrophobic, and gel-filtration column chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis of the active fractions after partial purification displayed two major protein bands with molecular masses of 25 and 42 kDa (Fig.1). During the purification procedure, intensities of the 42-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE corresponded well to the levels of FBPase activity in each fraction. The 25- and 42-kDa proteins were both subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The sequence of the 25-kDa protein (VVIGEKFPEVEVKTT) showed high similarity to probable peroxiredoxin proteins from various Archaea species. On the other hand, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 42-kDa protein (AVGDKITISVIKADI) exhibited high similarity with hypothetical proteins with no assigned function from Pyrococcus furiosus(AE010183), Pyrococcus abyssi (F75039), and Pyrococcus horikoshii (H71123). Among the 15 N-terminal amino acid residues of the 42-kDa protein, 13 residues were identical to those of the hypothetical proteins from P. furiosus, P. abyssi, and P. horikoshii. Therefore, two oligonucleotides were designed: one from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 42-kDa protein, and the other based on a conserved C-terminal region of the hypothetical proteins from thePyrococcus strains mentioned above. PCR with the two primers and genomic DNA of KOD1 as a template led to specific amplification of a DNA fragment with the expected length of ∼1-kilobase pair. The entire gene was then isolated from the genomic library of strain KOD1 using the 1-kilobase pair DNA fragment as a probe. DNA sequence analysis identified an open reading frame consisting of 1125 bp encoding a protein of 375 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 41,658 Da. The N-terminal sequence deduced from the open reading frame was identical to the N-terminal sequence of the 42-kDa protein from strain KOD1. No other open reading frames were found in the immediate flanking regions of the open reading frame. A putative ribosomal binding site (5′-GGTGG) was identified 6 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon along with a putative TATA-like element (TATAA, A-Box) 24 nucleotides upstream of the ribosomal binding site. A transcriptional termination signal (poly-(TC)) was also found downstream of the stop codon TGA. As we found that the gene encoded a protein with FBPase activity (see below), we named the geneTk-fbp. The deduced amino acid sequence of Tk-Fbp displayed high similarity to hypothetical proteins of unknown function from various Archaea strains and the bacterium Aquifex aeolicus. These included the hypothetical proteins from thePyrococcus species with similar N-terminal amino acid sequences. The Tk-Fbp sequence did not show similarity with previously reported Class I, Class II, or Class III FBPases. All orthologue gene products that were found in the genome data bases are listed in Table I and a representative alignment of the Archaea sequences is shown in Fig.2. Six regions relatively conserved among Class I FBPases from mammals, plants, fungi, and bacteria have been identified (6Rogers D.T. Hiller E. Mitsock L. Orr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, sequences with notable similarity to these regions were not found in the Tk-Fbp orthologues.Table ITk-Fbp orthologue genes found in complete genome sequencesOrganismAccession no.Locus nameSimilarity%T. kodakaraensisKOD1AB081839100P. furiosusAAL80737PF061397P. abyssiF75039PAB151596.5P. horikoshiiH71123PH075996.2Archaeoglobus fulgidusA69430AF144286.4A. pernixF72711APE110981.8Thermoplasma volcaniumBAB60612TVN144580M. thermoautotropicumD69092MTH168680M. jannaschiiAAB98286MJ029978.9Sulfolobus solfataricusAAK40625SSO028677.8A. aeolicusA70454Aq179076.8Pyrobaculum aerophilumAAL63145PAE094475.7 Open table in a new tab To characterize the protein product of the Tk-fbp gene, and to determine whether the enzyme was a bona fide FBPase, we expressed the gene in E. coli. When E. coliBL21(DE3) cells harboring the expression plasmids were grown at 37 °C and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for gene expression, the gene product was produced in a soluble form. The recombinant protein was purified to apparent homogeneity by heat treatment at 85 °C for 20 min followed by anion exchange and hydrophobic and gel filtration chromatography (Table II, Fig.3). The molecular mass of recombinant Tk-Fbp estimated by SDS-PAGE agreed with that deduced from the amino acid sequence. Furthermore, the N-terminal 14 amino acid residues of the purified protein were identical to the deduced amino acid sequence of the gene, confirming that we had obtained purified Tk-Fbp.Table IIPurification of recombinant Tk-FbpStepVolumeTotal proteinActivitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmlmgunitsunits/mg%-foldCell-free extract401903611.91001Heat-treatment392633613937Resource Q181628818799Mono Q1511220206010Resource ISO139207235712Superdex 200118192245313 Open table in a new tab The molecular mass of the purified Tk-Fbp was determined by gel filtration chromatography. Tk-Fbp eluted at a retention volume of 10.75 ml equivalent to a molecular mass of 340 kDa calculated from the standard curve obtained from the retention volume of the standard markers. Taking into account the molecular mass of the subunit (42 kDa), this result indicates that Tk-Fbp exists in an octameric form. Purified Tk-Fbp was dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm EDTA and used for further analysis. Activity measurements were performed in a linked assay coupled with phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Tk-Fbp displayed significant FBPase activity in the linked assay, and no activity was observed when any component of the reaction mixture was omitted. Particularly, we could not detect activity when phosphoglucose isomerase was removed from the reaction mixture, indicating that Tk-Fbp harbored only FBPase activity and not an additional phosphoglucose isomerase activity. We examined the effects of divalent metal cations on the enzyme activity. Addition of EDTA did not lead to a decrease in enzyme activity. Addition of Mg2+ significantly enhanced enzyme activity up to concentrations of 20 mm (>5-fold) (Fig. 4A). Addition of 1 mm Mn2+ led to a 4-fold increase in activity, but higher concentrations led to a decrease in this effect. Zn2+ also enhanced activity at 1 mm, whereas higher concentrations displayed an inhibitory effect. Ca2+and Ni2+ had no notable effects on activity (Fig.4A). We observed that dithioerythritol and, to a lesser extent, other reducing agents such as dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol stimulated enzyme activity at concentrations of 20 mm (Fig. 4B). One possibility may be that the reducing agents prevent inactivation of the enzyme by oxygen. We did observe a slight oxygen sensitivity in the enzyme, as we found a small decrease in activity when the purified enzyme solution was subjected to bubbling with air (∼6% decrease/min bubbling). A combination of Mg2+ and dithioerythritol resulted in a 9-fold increase in enzymatic activity (Fig. 4B). We examined the effect of pH and temperature on the FBPase activity of Tk-Fbp in the presence of 20 mm Mg2+ and 20 mm dithioerythritol. Tk-Fbp displayed maximal activity at pH 8.0 (Fig. 5A). The enzyme showed a nearly linear increase in activity between 37 and 95 °C, with a ∼6-fold increase between these temperatures (Fig.5B). At 95 °C and pH 8.0, Tk-Fbp displayed a specific activity of 24 units/mg. Kinetic analysis was also carried out, and Tk-Fbp catalyzed the reaction following Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km value of 100 μm toward fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and a kcat value of 17 s−1 subunit−1 at 95 °C. In a linked assay with fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Tk-Fbp did not exhibit activity for the reverse reaction. Thermostability of the recombinant protein was monitored in the presence of Mg2+ and the protein was found highly stable even at 100 °C. The enzyme displayed a half-life of ∼150 min in boiling water (data not shown). To further confirm the FBPase activity of Tk-Fbp, we examined the production of Fru-6-P from Fru-1,6-P2. Analysis with high performance liquid chromatography was carried out using d-Fru-6-P and d-Fru-1,6-P2 as standards. Under our measurement conditions, d-Fru-6-P eluted at a retention volume of 4.22 ml, whereas the retention volume for d-Fru-1,6-P2 was 17.63 ml. When purified Tk-Fbp was added in the reaction mixture we could detect the specific production of d-Fru-6-P from Fru-1,6-P2(data not shown). The peak corresponding to d-Fru-6-P increased with longer incubation periods of the reaction mixture, and the substrate peak decreased. An important observation was that when fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, and glucose 1-phosphate were incubated with Tk-Fbp, substrate levels did not change. The result indicates that the enzyme was specific for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. As mentioned above, FBPase is necessary when cells require the synthesis of sugars from gluconeogenic substrates such as pyruvate (2Shieh H.L. Chiang H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3381-3387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To examine the regulation of gene expression of Tk-fbp, KOD1 cells were grown independently on pyruvate and starch. Two probes were constructed for Northern blot analysis, one corresponding to the Tk-fbpgene, and the other corresponding to the DNA ligase gene from strain KOD1 (24Nakatani M. Ezaki S. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6424-6433Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Nakatani M. Ezaki S. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as a control. The mRNA of the Tk-fbp gene was clearly detected from the RNA of cells grown on pyruvate (Fig.6). In contrast, a positive signal could not be detected with the RNA of cells grown on starch. When cells were grown on amino acids, a condition that requires gluconeogenesis, Tk-fbp transcripts could also be detected. When pyruvate and starch were both present in the medium, only a very faint signal could be observed. Under all conditions, the signals of mRNA for the DNA ligase gene were visible irrespective of the carbon source. This result provides direct evidence that the transcription of theTk-fbp gene was regulated at the transcription level and under the control of glucose repression. We also measured FBPase activity in cells grown on pyruvate or starch. We found that starch-grown cells displayed a specific activity of 0.03 units/mg, ∼8% of the activity detected in pyruvate-grown cells (0.4 units/mg). Complete genome sequences have contributed enormously in identifying the presence or absence of particular genes in various microorganisms (26Fraser C.M. Eisen J.A. Salzberg S.L. Nature. 2000; 406: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 27Nelson K.E. Paulsen I.T. Heidelberg J.F. Fraser C.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, this advantage heavily relies on the assumption that proteins with similar function will display similarity in primary structure. The archaeal FBPases have represented an intriguing exception to this assumption. Although FBPase activity had been detected in P. furiosus (20Schäfer T. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 159: 354-363Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (19Fuchs G. Winter H. Steiner I. Stupperich E. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 136: 160-162Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), no orthologue genes of previously identified FBPases were present on Archaea genomes. A most interesting and valuable finding was that the MJ0109 gene product from M. jannaschii harbored an unexpected FBPase activity in addition to its expected inositol monophosphatase activity. The report also mentions that orthologue genes from A. fulgidus and Thermotoga maritima also encode a protein with FBPase activity (21Stec B. Yang H. Johnson K.A. Chen L. Roberts M.F. Nat. Struct.

In this study, we have identified and characterized a novel FBPase, Tk-Fbp, from the hyperthermophilic archaeon, T. kodakaraensis KOD1. The structure is distinct to the structures of all previously identified FBPases, including the MJ0109 gene product from M. jannaschii. The FBPase activity has been detected by both an enzyme linked assay and direct observation of substrate and product, leaving no doubt that Tk-Fbp harbors FBPase activity. Tk-Fbp displayed a Km value of 100 μm toward fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and a kcat value of 17 s−1 subunit−1 at 95 °C. TheKm value was slightly higher than that observed for the MJ0109 gene product (38 μm). Thekcat value of Tk-Fbp at 85 °C was ∼2-fold higher than the M. jannaschii enzyme (7 s−1 subunit−1 at 85 °C). Thekcat value of Tk-Fbp at 37 °C (2.9 s−1 subunit−1) was ∼20% of that of the FBPase from E. coli (14.6 s−1subunit−1). Tk-Fbp did not display catalytic activity for the reverse reaction, indicating that it is not the protein responsible for 6-phosphofructokinase activity in strain KOD1. In support, phosphofructokinases have been identified and characterized in various Archaea including P. furiosus (28Tuininga J.E. Verhees C.H. van der Oost J. Kengen S.W. Stams A.J. de Vos W.M. J.

Lett. 2001; 202: 85-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and these proteins do not correspond to the Tk-Fbp orthologues mentioned in this study. The results of this study strongly indicate that Tk-Fbp is the major FBPase in T. kodakaraensis KOD1. Besides the high activity of the purified enzyme mentioned above, we could not detect FBPase activity in fractions other than those containing Tk-Fbp during partial purification from pyruvate-grown KOD1 cells. Furthermore, the enzyme displayed high substrate specificity toward fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, unlike the MJ0109 gene product from M. jannaschii (21Stec B. Yang H. Johnson K.A. Chen L. Roberts M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1046-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). No activity could be observed with fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, and glucose 1-phosphate. Finally, the gene expression was strictly regulated in a manner that perfectly agreed with its presumed physiological role. Gene transcription was repressed in the presence of starch, regardless of the presence or absence of pyruvate. Derepression was also observed in cells grown on either amino acids or pyruvate, indicating that the regulation was not because of induction by a certain carbon source, but a typical example of glucose repression/derepression. These findings lead us to conclude that, at least in the case of T. kodakaraensis KOD1, Tk-Fbp is the “missing” archaeal FBPase. At present, it is difficult to determine whether the Tk-Fbp orthologues represent the missing FBPases in other Archaea strains. However, it should be noted that among the complete microbial genome sequences, all thermophilic Archaea harbored a highly similar gene on their chromosomes (Table I). In addition, a Tk-fbp orthologue was also present in the hyperthermophilic bacterium A. aeolicus. This at least denies that Tk-fbp itself is not a unique gene for T. kodakaraensis KOD1. Additionally, as most of these genes display 75–97% similarity to Tk-fbp, it is highly likely that their gene products harbor FBPase activity. Gene disruption studies and biochemical characterization of Tk-Fbp orthologues in other Archaea strains will be an attractive subject of future research on gluconeogenesis in Archaea."

Here, we report that caspase-8 not only triggers and amplifies the apoptotic process at cytoplasmic sites but can also act as an executioner at nuclear levels. In a murine model of acute ischemia, caspase-8 is relocated into the nucleus of apoptotic neurons, where it cleaves PARP-2, a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family involved in DNA repair. As indicated by site-directed mutagenesis, PARP-2 cleavage occurs preferentially at the LQMD sequence mapped between the DNA binding and the catalytic domains of the protein. This is close to the cleavage sequence found in Bid, the cytoplasmic target of caspase-8. Activity assays confirm that cleavage of PARP-2 results in inactivation of its poly(ADP-ribosylation) property, proportional to the efficiency of the cleavage. Our findings add to the complexity of proteolytic caspase networks by demonstrating that caspase-8 is in turn an initiator, amplifier, and effector caspase.

They exist in all nucleated cells as inactive zymogens and are activated by proteolytic cleavage. Caspases are categorized into initiators and effectors on the basis of their position in apoptotic proteolytic cascades (4Nunez G. Benedict M.A., Hu, Y. Inohara N.

Initiator caspases trigger and amplify apoptosis by activating effector caspases and proapoptotic factors. Effector caspases act at cytoplasmic sites, and eventually at other organelles, including the nucleus, to execute the proteolytic program that finalizes cell destruction (6Nicholson D.W.

Caspase-8 (Flice/MACH/mch 5) is the prototypical caspase of so-called death receptor pathways of apoptosis, activated by ligand binding to members of the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)1 receptor superfamily (9Boldin M.P.

This results in the recruitment, cleavage, and activation of pro-caspase-8, -2, and -10 (12Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E.

Active caspase-8 propagates the apoptotic signal by activating downstream effector caspases, such as caspase-3 and -7 (14Stennicke H.R. Jurgensmeier J.M. Shin H. Deveraux Q. Wolf B.B. Yang X. Zhou Q. Ellerby H.M. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Green D.R. Reed J.C. Froelich C.J. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27084-27090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Besides this direct initiator role, caspase-8 amplifies the proteolytic cascade by cleaving the cytoplasmic factor Bid (15Li H. Zhu H., Xu, C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar), a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Bid interacts with Bax to initiate the so-called “mitochondrial pathway” of apoptosis, mediated by activation of caspase-9 in the apoptosome (7Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 therefore contributes to cell death both by direct activation of effector caspases and by the initiation of another major cascade of the apoptotic process. Caspase-8 was traditionally considered a strictly cytoplasmic protein, activated in the cytoplasm and cleaving cytoplasmic substrates, but this simple schema has been challenged by two recent studies. First, measurable levels of pro-caspase-8 have been observed in the nucleus of cultured fibroblasts and striatal neurons (16Qin Z.H. Wang Y. Kikly K.K. Sapp E. Kegel K.B. Aronin N. DiFiglia M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8079-8086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Second, active caspase-8 was shown to bind aggregates of truncated hungtintin in the nucleus of cultured neurons overexpressing the pathogen protein (17Sanchez I., Xu, C.J. Juo P. Kakizaka A. Blenis J. Yuan J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 623-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 activation is involved in a number of neurodegenerative pathologies (17Sanchez I., Xu, C.J. Juo P. Kakizaka A. Blenis J. Yuan J.

J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possibility of a nuclear role for active caspase-8 in focal cerebral ischemia, a paradigm known to trigger massive cytoplasmic activation of caspase-8 in apoptotic neurons (18Benchoua A. Gueágan C. Couriaud C. Hosseini H. Sampaio N. Morin D. Onteániente B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7127-7134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Velier J.J. Ellison J.A. Kikly K.K. Spera P.A. Barone F.C. Feuerstein G.Z. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5932-5941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results reveal that nuclear caspase-8 targets and inactivates PARP-2, a recently identified member of the poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP) family, which plays an active role in base excision repair mechanisms (22Ameá J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Hoger T. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Thus, caspase-8 has distinct cytoplasmic and nuclear roles in the processing of ischemia-induced apoptotic cell death. Studies were performed on 8-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice (25–30 g, Janvier, Le genest-St-Isles, France). Permanent focal cerebral ischemia was performed by electrocoagulation and section of the left middle cerebral artery (MCAO) according to Ref. 23Shigeno T. McCulloch J. Graham D.I. Mendelow A.D. Teasdale G.M. Surg. Neurol. 1985; 24: 47-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar under 4% chloral hydrate anesthesia. Sham-operated animals were subjected to the same procedure without MCA electrocoagulation and section. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 3, or 6 h post-MCAO. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described on perfusion-fixed brain sections (18Benchoua A. Gueágan C. Couriaud C. Hosseini H. Sampaio N. Morin D. Onteániente B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7127-7134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-pro-caspase-8 and anti-active caspase-8 (SK441 and SK440, respectively, GlaxoSmithKline, (21Velier J.J. Ellison J.A. Kikly K.K. Spera P.A. Barone F.C.

DNA was visualized by staining with Hoescht 33258 (Sigma) for light microscopy or with Yo-Pro-3 (Molecular Probes) for confocal microscopy. Images were recorded on a Zeiss LSM confocal microscope or an Axioplan II microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a CoolScan (Photometrics) video camera. Protein fractions were isolated from MCA-supplied regions dissected from the hemicortex of ischemized or sham animals. For nuclear protein extraction, tissues were treated as described in Ref. 24Cauley K. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar. Caspase-8 catalytic activity was measured with the synthetic substrate acetyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (ac-IETD-AFC, Biomol Research Laboratories) as described (18Benchoua A. Gueágan C. Couriaud C. Hosseini H. Sampaio N. Morin D. Onteániente B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7127-7134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For PARP cleavage studies, 25 ng of human PARP-1 or mouse PARP-2 were incubated with increasing quantities of purified recombinant human (rh) active caspase-8 (Upstate Biotechnology) in the caspase assay buffer (18Benchoua A. Gueágan C. Couriaud C. Hosseini H. Sampaio N. Morin D. Onteániente B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7127-7134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 2 h at 37 °C. Controls were performed with 1 unit of rh-caspase-9 (Biomol Research Laboratories). The entire assay sample was then resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel. For inhibition studies, 200 nm c-IETD-fluoro-methyl-ketone (ac-IETD-FMK) were preincubated with the active caspase-8 for 30 min at room temperature. To test PARP-2 cleavage in vivo, rh-caspase-8 (1 unit) or 100 μg of nuclear proteins from cortical tissues were incubated with 5 μl of GST·PARP-2 fusion proteins (22Ameá J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) attached to glutathione-agarose beads in caspase assay buffer for 2 h at 37 °C. The beads were washed extensively and collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was subjected to immunoblotting for GST (anti-GST, Sigma). For quantification of in vivolevels of active caspase-8 and PARP-2, membranes containing 25 μg of proteins per sample were probed with primary antibodies (anti-caspase-8, Santa-Cruz Biotechnology; anti-PARP-2, YUC antibody). Antigens were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (AmershamBiosciences, ECL+). Densitometric values expressed in arbitrary units were estimated by the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) and were normalized to the corresponding Coomassie Blue control densitometric values (also estimated by ImageQuant) to avoid variations due to inequal loading of the sample, before statistical comparison. Multiple film exposures were used to verify the linearity of the samples analyzed and avoid saturation of the film. For microsequencing of the C-terminal fragment of PARP-2, an amplification scale of the cleavage reaction was resolved with SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the 37-kDa band was cut out and was subjected to microsequencing at the custom service of INSERM U184 (Strasbourg, France). For site-directed mutagenesis, mPARP-2 cDNA was subcloned between the SmaI and theNotI sites of the PBS-KS vector (Stratagene). Aspartic acid residues at positions 119 and 186 were individually mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Mutated sites were verified by DNA sequencing. The corresponding proteins were produced using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) with T3 as the polymerase. Mutated proteins were then subjected to the PARP-2 cleavage assay as described above. PARP-2 activity assay was performed according to Ref. 22Ameá J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Hoger T. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar. Five hundred ng of native or caspase-8-cleaved mPARP-2 were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in 100 μl of assay buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of calf thymus DNA pretreated with DNase I, 200 μmAND, and 400 μm [α-32P]NAD. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 1% inorganic phosphate. The samples were filtered, the acid-insoluble radioactive residue was washed three times in the same solution and once in 95% ethanol, and radioactivity was measured with a Wallac 1409 liquid scintillation counter. The efficiency of the cleavage was assessed by quantitative immunoblotting. We first examined the presence of caspase-8 activity in the nucleus of apoptotic neuronal cells after MCAO by using immunofluorescence and confocal analysis performed with antibodies specific for either the pro-caspase-8 or the active protease (21Velier J.J. Ellison J.A. Kikly K.K. Spera P.A. Barone F.C. Feuerstein G.Z. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5932-5941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Active caspase-8 was observed at 3 h after ischemia in the nucleus of cortical neurons with condensed chromatin, localized in the ischemic core (Fig. 1a). Pro-caspase-8 was expressed in both the core and penumbra and localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, as confirmed by confocal microscopy (Fig.1b). The proteolytic activity of nuclear protein extracts from brain tissues was then measured at various time intervals following MCAO. Cleavage of IETD-AFC was significantly increased at 3 and 6 h post-MCAO (Fig.1c). This indicates the presence of a caspase-8-like proteolytic activity in the nuclear fraction of apoptotic neurons. To confirm the participation of caspase-8 in this cleavage, nuclear levels of processed (p18) caspase-8 were estimated by immunoblotting (Fig.1d). Densitometric quantification of the band (arbitrary units) revealed a 2-fold increase of p18 levels between sham (375 ± 2.91, n = 4 animals) and 3 h (699 ± 62,n = 4 animals) or 6 h (693 ± 106,n = 4 animals) post-MCAO. Levels were significantly increased only at 3 h post-MCAO (p < 0.05, one-factor analysis of variance with Student’s t test). The high level of processed caspase-8 protein levels in the sham specimen may be explained by the fact that the sham surgery (anesthesia and surgery without occlusion of the artery) increases the activity of a number of caspases, including caspase-8, when compared with naive animals (18Benchoua A. Gueágan C. Couriaud C. Hosseini H. Sampaio N. Morin D. Onteániente B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7127-7134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Active caspase-8 levels increased with a time course parallel to the one determined by activity assays. The large discrepancy between the active caspase-8 content and the protease activity on IETD-AFC is in accordance with the catalytic properties of the caspase proteases on their substrates (25Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies provide evidence that caspase-8 activity is induced in the nucleus of ischemic neurons. We then proceeded to find potential targets of nuclear caspase-8 by exploring members of the PARP family, which display crucial functions in apoptosis-induced DNA damage (26Smith S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). PARP-1 is a nuclear substrate of caspases-3 and -7 (27Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z.

Poirier G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28379-28384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and cleavage of PARP-1 by caspase-3 is critical to ischemic cell death (29Joashi U.C. Greenwood K. Taylor D.L. Kozma M. Mazarakis N.D. Edwards A.D. Mehmet H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Gueágan C. Sola B. Brain Res. 2000; 856: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Among PARP family members, PARP-2 participates along with PARP-1 in the DNA repair process by poly(ADP-ribosylation) of a number of substrates (31Schreiber V. Ameá J.C. Dolle P. Schultz I. Rinaldi B. Fraulob V. Menissier-De Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 10: 10Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that the PARPs are substrates of nuclear caspase-8, we first confirmed that PARP-2 was present in the nucleus of ischemic neurons (Fig. 2a) as described for other cell types (22Ameá J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Hoger T. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Confocal analysis of cells double-labeled with anti-PARP-2 and anti-caspase-8 antibodies showed that nuclear active caspase-8 was co-localized with PARP-2 in neurons at 3 h post-MCAO (Fig. 2b). To investigate whether PARP-2 cleavage occurs during ischemia, we examined the expression pattern of the protein at 1, 3, and 6 h following arterial occlusion. Analysis of PARP-2 levels by immunoblotting was performed on nuclear protein extracts using the YUC antibody raised against the catalytic domain of the protein (22Ameá J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Hoger T. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Levels of a C-terminal fragment with an apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa increased as a function of time post-MCAO (Fig.2c, d). This increase kinetically coincided with the activation of caspase-8 in the nucleus, suggesting a relationship between the two events. To determine whether the PARPs are substrates of caspase-8, we tested the ability of active rh-caspase-8 to cleave recombinant hPARP-1 and mPARP-2 in vitro. Both PARPs were cleaved in vitro. However, cleavage of PARP-1 by caspase-8 generated a fragment of 48 kDa (Fig.3a), which differs from the 89-kDa fragment reported in vivo (32Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). In contrast, mPARP-2 was cleaved by rh-caspase-8 to generate a C-terminal fragment with the same electrophoretic mobility as the fragment producedin vivo (Fig. 3b). Since the recombinant protease was produced in Escherichia coli, potential contamination by endogenous bacterial proteases was excluded by performing the same assay in the presence of the caspase-8 inhibitor c-IETD-FMK (Fig. 3b). Inhibition of caspase-8 totally abolished the fragment. No cleavage of PARP-2 was observed with 1 unit of caspase-9 (Fig. 3b). We next determined whether caspase-8 was an effector of PARP-2 cleavagein vivo. A cell-free system based on nuclear protein extracts was combined with a GST pull-down assay. N-terminal GST-tagged mPARP-2 was incubated with nuclear extracts of sham or 3-h post-MCAO cortical tissue, with or without a caspase-8 inhibitor. Rh-caspase-8 generated a 52-kDa fragment that corresponds to the N-terminal GST-tagged cleavage product of PARP-2 (Fig. 3b). A similar fragment was generated by nuclear extracts from apoptotic tissue. Inhibition of caspase-8 by c-IETD-FMK totally abolished this process. These results indicate that PARP-2 is a target of nuclear caspase-8 in neurons undergoing apoptosis. The production of a single fragment and the high efficiency of cleavage suggest that PARP-2 contains a consensus sequence for recognition and cleavage by caspase-8. The mouse PARP-2 sequence (GenBankTM accession number AJ007780) displays two potential cleavage sites, 116Leu-Glu-Asp-Asp119(LEDD) and 183Leu-Gln-Met-Asp186 (LQMD), which reside between the DNA binding domain and the catalytic site of the protein (Fig. 4a). These sites are conserved in human PARP-2 (GenBankTM accession numberAJ236912). Both match the preferred cleavage sites of caspase-8, as determined by combinatorial peptide library screening (34Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

Tomaselli K.J. Grutter M.G. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 1125-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, the LQMD site resembles the one cleaved by caspase-8 in the proapoptotic protein Bid (15Li H. Zhu H., Xu, C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar). Cleavage at these sites would release C-terminal fragments with a theoretical molecular mass of 47 and 37 kDa, respectively (Fig. 4c), both of which are close to the apparent molecular mass of the fragment obtained in the in vitro assay. Microsequencing of the released C-terminal fragment obtained in thein vitro assay indicated that cleavage of PARP-2 by caspase-8 occurs at Asp186. This was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. The two aspartic acid residues (Asp119 and Asp186) were mutated individually to glutamic acid in order to keep the negative charge. The two proteins generated, namely D119E and D186E, were subjected to cleavage by rh-caspase-8. Both mutations were effective in decreasing PARP-2 cleavage by caspase-8, but in correlation with the results of microsequencing, the second mutation had a more dramatic effect (Fig.4b). This result points to the LQMD site as the preferential caspase-8 cleavage site of PARP-2. Cleavage of PARP-1 by caspase-3 results in a loss of its ability to be activated by DNA breaks and to synthesize ADP-ribose polymers, thus impairing DNA repair mechanisms (27Tewari M. Quan L.T.

Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the poly(ADP-ribosylation) activity of PARP-2 is dependent on the presence of DNA strand breaks (22Ameá J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Hoger T. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), and impaired PARP-2 function results in a defective DNA repair process (31Schreiber V. Ameá J.C. Dolle P. Schultz I. Rinaldi B. Fraulob V. Menissier-De Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 10: 10Google Scholar). To confirm that PARP-2 cleavage by caspase-8 leads to its inactivation, we evaluated the catalytic efficiency of cleaved PARP-2. The efficiency of cleavage of PARP-2 is directly correlated with the inhibition of its capacity to synthesize polymers (TableI). These results show that caspase-mediated cleavage results in the loss of the main biological function of PARP-2.Table ICleavage by caspase-8 inactivates PARP-2Native PARP-2Caspase-8-cleaved PARP-2 (30%)Caspase-8-cleaved PARP-2 (100%)Relative PARP activity (%)100 ± 8.767.13 ± 8.61-ap < 0.05versus native PARP-2.3.55 ± 3.051-bp < 0.01 versusnative PARP-2.PARP activity of native or caspase-8-cleaved mPARP-2 was measured by incubating each sample with DNAse-I-treated DNA and [α-32P]NAD+.

The findings reported here indicate the existence of a nuclear pathway in caspase-8-mediated apoptotic neuronal death. Considered an initiator caspase until now, caspase-8 displays the anatomical and functional characteristics of an effector caspase. During ischemia, caspase-8 translocates into the nucleus of apoptotic neurons and targets at least one nuclear protein of the PARP family involved in cell maintenance and homeostasis. This evidence for a novel role for caspase-8 has a direct consequence on the way caspases should be regarded in the complex cascade of events that control apoptosis (Fig.5). The first result of this study is the demonstration of caspase-8 activity in the nucleus of ischemic cells. The comparison of these data with previous descriptions of caspase-8 activity in the same model (18Benchoua A. Gueágan C. Couriaud C. Hosseini H. Sampaio N. Morin D. Onteániente B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7127-7134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) shows that caspase-8 is activated sequentially in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. During focal ischemia, the cytoplasmic activation of caspase-8 is biphasic with two peaks separated by a period of lower activity at 3 h post-MCAO (18Benchoua A. Gueágan C. Couriaud C. Hosseini H. Sampaio N. Morin D. Onteániente B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7127-7134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which corresponds to the period of maximal activity of caspase-8 in the nucleus, suggesting that cytoplasmic and nuclear activations complement each other in the process of cell death. Our second set of data assigned a crucial role for caspase-8 in the nuclear events of apoptosis. The growing PARP family is currently composed of five members (26Smith S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 36Shall S. de Murcia G. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Among the PARPs, PARP-1 and PARP-2 respond to DNA strand breaks by poly(ADP-ribosylation) of nuclear proteins (30Gueágan C. Sola B. Brain Res. 2000; 856: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S.

They therefore play a critical role in the maintenance of genomic integrity by modulating DNA repair and cell survival programs (22Ameá J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Hoger T. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Cleavage of PARP-1 by caspase-3 is well documented in several models involving apoptotic cell death (37Duriez P.J. Shah G.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In our study, caspase-8 cleavage of PARP-1 in vitrogenerated a fragment with an electrophoretic mobility very different from that observed in vivo in the same model (30Gueágan C. Sola B. Brain Res. 2000; 856: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 38Krupinski J. Lopez E. Marti E. Ferrer I. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and in other models of neurodegenerative diseases (39Keane R.W. Srinivasan A. Foster L.M. Testa M.P. Ord T. Nonner D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Bredesen D.E. Kayalar C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 40Ni B., Wu, X., Du, Y., Su, Y. Hamilton-Byrd E. Rockey P.K.

Neurol. 2001; 60: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This cleavage may have no physiological relevance, although the possibility of its occurrence in the case of caspase-3 deficiency cannot be ruled out. In contrast, fragments obtained after the cleavage of PARP-2 by caspase-8in vitro and in vivo are similar, indicating that this cleavage occurs under pathological conditions. Together, these results point to PARP-2 as the preferred substrate of caspase-8, although caspase-3 also cleaves PARP-1 and PARP-2. 2J. de Murcia, personal communication. The complementary, and eventually synergistic, actions of caspases on two members of the PARP family may act as a fail-safe system for the execution of the apoptotic program. As described for PARP-1 (43D'Amours D. Sallmann F.R. Dixit V.M. Poirier G.G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3771-3778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cleavage of PARP-2 between the DNA binding domain and the catalytic site of the protein suppresses its ADP-ribose polymerization properties. Cleavage of PARP-2 by caspase-8 therefore amplifies DNA damage by adding to the DNA proteolysis resulting from PARP-1 inactivation by caspase-3 and -7. Inactivation of the PARPs also prevents depletion of ATP, which is needed to restore the PARP substrate nicotinamide adenosine diphosphate (44Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13978-13982Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). The inactivation of PARP proteins therefore promotes the apoptotic process both by conserving essential ATP and by inhibiting poly(ADP-ribosylation) that would otherwise delay chromatin degradation (45Oliver F.J. de la Rubia G. Rolli V. Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. de Murcia G. Murcia J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33533-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Classical descriptions of the intracellular events that lead to cell apoptosis have differentiated two groups of caspases, referred to as initiator and effector caspases, on the basis of a set of functional criteria (46Friedlander R.M. Gagliardini V. Hara H. Fink K.B., Li, W. MacDonald G. Fishman M.C. Greenberg A.H. Moskowitz M.A. Yuan J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 47Fink K.

In particular, initiator and effector caspases differ in the size, and consequently the function, of their prodomain (7Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), in their ability to translocate from the cytosol to other compartments, and in their sets of substrates (8Zhivotovsky B. Samali A. Gahm A. Orrenius S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 644-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 20Cohen G.M. Biochem.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10815-10818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The demonstration of a dual role for caspase-8 as presented here concurs with recent data concerning other caspases, which suggests that established unidirectional models of caspase cascades in apoptotic pathways have to be modified. In hierarchical cascades of proteolytical activations (see Ref. 4Nunez G. Benedict M.A., Hu, Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar for a review), one type of apoptotic stimulus (e.g. death domain receptor activation, mitochondrial impairment, or reticular stress) leads to the activation of a unique cytoplasmic initiator caspase, which propagates the apoptotic signal by processing several effector or downstream caspases. However, new data have demonstrated that downstream caspases are able, in turn, to process the zymogens of initiator caspases, leading to their activation and thus creating a positive feedback loop that contributes to the amplification of the signal (49Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, caspases-2 and -9, originally considered as initiators, may exhibit effector-like characteristics (50Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Van den brande I. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 51Nakanishi K. Maruyama M. Shibata T. Morishima N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41237-41244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The result of this cross-talk is the parallel involvement of different caspase pathways, independent of the triggering stimulus. In agreement with these studies, although caspase-8 activation is classically described as linked to the activation of receptors of the TNF receptor family, some data suggest that it can be activated in a receptor-independent manner (52Ding H.F. Lin Y.L. McGill G. Juo P. Zhu H. Blenis J. Yuan J. Fisher D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38905-38911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and that caspase-8 activation may be secondary to the activation of other caspases (18Benchoua A. Gueágan C. Couriaud C. Hosseini H. Sampaio N. Morin D. Onteániente B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7127-7134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A.

Boonplueang R. Chen S. Stevenson F.F. Yantiri F. Yang L. Beal M.F. Andersen J.K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9519-9528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results add to this complexity, showing that caspase-8 simultaneously participates in multiple intracellular pathways with distinct goals. In conclusion, the current models of apoptotic signaling pathways that involve parallel cascades of activation of specific caspases do not correctly reflect the data available on these proteases. Although the design of new signaling models will require much additional data, it is likely that they will take the form of interactive and complementary loops rather than cascades. We thank Drs. M.

However, after 48 h of exponential growth, the cells begin to differentiate along the granulocytic pathway (7Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B.

Ectopic expression of IRS-1 in 32D IGF-IR cells (32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells) inhibits differentiation. The cells become IL-3-independent and form tumors in mice (11Valentinis B. Navarro M.

In parental 32D cells, expression of only IRS-1 does not prevent apoptosis, although it delays it slightly (3Zhou-Li F., Xu, S.-Q. Dews M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12Zamorano J. Wang H.Y. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H. Keegan A.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4926-4934PubMed Google Scholar). The interactions of the IGF axis with the SV40 T antigen (hitherto abbreviated as T antigen) are complex. The SV40 T antigen interacts closely with IRS-1, as demonstrated by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation. This is true in both MEF (13Zhou-Li F. D'Ambrosio C., Li, S. Surmacz E. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4232-4239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 32D cells (3Zhou-Li F., Xu, S.-Q. Dews M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Truncation of the 250 amino-terminal residues of the T antigen abrogates both its ability to co-transform cells in combination with IRS-1 and its ability to co-precipitate IRS-1 (13Zhou-Li F. D'Ambrosio C., Li, S. Surmacz E. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4232-4239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 32D cells expressing T antigen are not protected from apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal, and they actually die even faster than parental 32D cells (3Zhou-Li F., Xu, S.-Q. Dews M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, neither IRS-1 nor T antigen singly can protect parental 32D cells from apoptosis. However, a combination of the two results in the survival of 32D cells after IL-3 withdrawal (3Zhou-Li F., Xu, S.-Q. Dews M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). IRS-1 is known to interact also with nucleolin (14Burks D.J. Wang J. Towery H. Ishibashi O. Lowe D. Riedel H. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31061-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Both T antigen and nucleolin are predominantly nuclear proteins, although minor fractions of either protein can be detected in the cytosol (15Santos M. Butel J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 19: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 16Hovanessian A.G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Nisole S. Svab J. Perret E. Deng J.S. Krust B. Exp.

Cell Science. 1999; 112: 761-772PubMed Google Scholar). It has been therefore tacitly assumed that IRS-1, anchored to the receptors, was interacting with the minor cytosolic fractions of either T antigen or nucleolin. A recent report, however, has indicated that under certain conditions IRS-1 can be translocated to the nuclei (18Lassak A. Del Valle L. Peruzzi F. Wang J.Y. Enam S. Croul S. Khalili K. Reiss K. J.

The situation is further complicated by the fact that T antigen induces 24p3 (19Hraba-Renevey S. Turler H. Kress M. Solomon C. Weill R.

According to these authors, IGF-I inhibits the transcription of 24p3. A reasonable hypothesis at this point would be that T antigen cannot transform 32D cells because it does not inhibit 24p3 transcription, in fact it superinduces it. Ectopic expression of IRS-1, activated by IGF-I, could inhibit 24p3 transcription and thus rescue 32D/T cells from apoptosis. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the subcellular localization of IRS-1 in 32D-derived cells that survive and growversus cells that do not survive and undergo apoptosis. In addition, we have tested the hypothesis that survival may depend on the inhibition of 24p3 transcription. Using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we show here that IRS-1 is localized to the cytosol in 32D IRS-1 cells, which undergo apoptosis upon IL-3 withdrawal (3Zhou-Li F., Xu, S.-Q.

However, in 32D IRS-1/T cells and in 32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells, which survive (and grow) in the absence of IL-3 (3Zhou-Li F., Xu, S.-Q. Dews M. Baserga R.

We have demonstrated the nuclear localization of IRS-1 by a variety of procedures and showed that it also occurs in MEF, where we have confirmed it by subcellular fractionation. In 32D IGF-IR cells, we show that a mutant IRS-1 with a deleted phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain will not translocate to the nuclei, whereas the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain does not seem to be required. We also find that cytosolic IRS-1 inhibits (as predicted) 24p3 transcription, but in the absence of T antigen or an overexpressed IGF-IR, the cells still die, albeit more slowly than the parental 32D cells. When IRS-1 is in combination with either T antigen or an overexpressed IGF-IR, it translocates to the nucleus, and the cells survive. The focus of this paper is to demonstrate rigorously that IRS-1 can translocate to the nuclei of 32D-derived cells and to establish some of the conditions of this translocation. 32D, 32D/T, 32D IRS-1, and 32D IRS-1/T cells have been described by Zhou-Li et al. (3Zhou-Li F., Xu, S.-Q. Dews M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 32D IRS-1/IGF-IR cells express both the human wild type IGF-IR and mouse IRS-1 (7Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5149-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). They are 32D IGF-IR cells stably transfected with plasmids expressing mutant IRS-1 proteins. The mutants used in these experiments include an IRS-1 with a deletion of the PH domain, a mutant with a deletion of the PTB domain, and another plasmid expressing only the PH/PTB domains (24Belletti B.

In other experiments, we used R−/GR15 cells, which are MEFs derived from R− cells (25Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.-P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). R−/GR15 cells express substantial levels of human IGF-IR and endogenous IRS-1 (26Romano G. Prisco M. Zanocco-Marani T. Peruzzi F. Valentinis B. Baserga R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 294-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In some experiments, parental 32D and 32D/T cells were transiently transfected with the pIRS-1 Flag plasmid (see below), using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), following the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the transfected cells were examined by confocal microscopy. Only transfected cells were positive for the FLAG antibody. pIRS/FLAG was generated from pGR159 MSCV.pac retroviral vector (26Romano G. Prisco M. Zanocco-Marani T. Peruzzi F. Valentinis B. Baserga R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 294-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) by fusing in-frame the wild type mouse IRS-1 sequence with the FLAG sequence (Kodak) at the 3′ end. The IRS-1 sequence fused in-frame with the FLAG epitope at the 3′ end was produced by PCR. The detailed methodology for the construction of the retroviral vector has been described previously (26Romano G. Prisco M. Zanocco-Marani T. Peruzzi F. Valentinis B. Baserga R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 294-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 24p3 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from 32D cells, 4 h after IL-3 withdrawal. 32D cells were washed three times with Hanks' buffer and seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 4 h. The cells were collected and washed with cold PBS, and RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit from Qiagen. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed with C. hydrogenoformansthermostable polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (one-step reverse transcription-PCR system; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The primers used were: forward 5′-AGACCTAGTAGCTGTGGAAACC-3′ and reverse 5′-GGGGGCATGTATTTATTCAG-3′. The annealing temperature used was 56 °C. The 24p3 cDNA was subcloned in pCR 2.1 vector using the Topo TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequence of 24p3 cDNA was monitored using T7 and M13 reverse primers and by comparison with the sequence in the BLAST program. 32D and 32D-derived cells (see above) were washed three times with Hanks' buffer and seeded 2 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS or IGF-1 50 ng/ml on poly-l-lysine coverslips for16 h. The cells were fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde solution for 30 min., washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X100 solution in PBS for 2 min, and washed three times with PBS. The blocking was done for 30 min using 10% normal donkey serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted in PBS, and the slides were incubated for 45 min with the appropriate antibodies. Confocal analysis was performed on a Bio-Rad MRC-600 Ar/Kr laser scanning confocal microscope interfaced to a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope with Zeiss Plan-Apo 63× oil immersion objective and a Zeiss 40× objective. The samples were analyzed with simultaneous excitation at 488 and 568 nm with proper filters to visualize fluorescein and rhodamine-lissamine signals. 32D and 32D-derived cells were washed three times with Hanks' buffer and seeded at a density of 5 × 104/2 ml of RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS plus or minus IGF-I (50 ng/ml). The cells were harvested after 16 h, and cytospins were prepared. The fibroblasts were seeded on coverslips (5 × 104 cells/2 ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FBS. After the cells had attached to the coverslip, they were shifted to serum-free medium for 24 h and then stimulated with IGF-I (50 ng/ml) for another 6 h. After fixing in 3.7% formaldehyde solution in PBS and permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, the immunostaining was carried out using the Histomouse (AEC) kit (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. The magnifications for the figures presented in this paper were either 400× or 1000×. The cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/100 mm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The following day, the cells were shifted to serum-free medium for 48 h and then stimulated with IGF-1 (50 ng/ml) for 6 h. The cells were harvested with cold PBS, collected by scraping, and washed twice in a 15-ml Falcon tube with cold PBS. The cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, protease and phosphatase inhibitors from Sigma, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Triton X-100), kept on ice for 10 min, and then homogenized with a tight fitting Dounce and examined under microscope to confirm that the cells were lysed. After centrifugation at 4 °C, 500 ×g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected, centrifuged again at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet of the first centrifugation was washed at least three times with buffer B (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 8, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, protease and phosphatase inhibitors from Sigma, and 100 mm dithiothreitol), resuspended in buffer C (350 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 8, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, protease and phosphatase inhibitors from Sigma, and 100 mm dithiothreitol), and kept rocking for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant collected represented the nuclear fraction. 20 μg of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were separated on a 4–15% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The primary antibodies used were: nucleolin monoclonal antibody, SV40 T antigen monoclonal antibody, Id2 polyclonal antibody, IRS-1(C20) polyclonal antibody with the epitope mapping at the carboxyl terminus of IRS-1, and IRS-1(C19) with the epitope mapping at the amino terminus of IRS-1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody and another anti-IRS-1 polyclonal antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Clathrin polyclonal antibody was a kind gift of Dr. J. H. Keen (Thomas Jefferson University). All of these antibodies were used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. After washing three times with PBS, the samples were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to rhodamine or fluorescein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). In some experiments the nuclei were stained with propidium iodide from Molecular Probes. For Western blots, the antibodies used were anti-IRS-1(C20), anti-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-glyceraldheyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Research Diagnostics, Inc.). Northern blots were carried out using standard techniques using the full-length 24p3 mouse cDNA described above. Parental 32D cells die quickly after IL-3 withdrawal, with most of the cells dead by 24 h (1Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altmann S. Santoli D. Rovera G. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3829-3835PubMed Google Scholar, 2Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar). Cell death is easily demonstrated by simply counting the number of cells (10Dews M. Prisco M. Peruzzi F. Romano G. Morrione A. Baserga R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Navarro M. Baserga R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The evidence that the mode of cell death is apoptosis has been repeatedly documented in previous papers from this and other laboratories. In our first paper (3Zhou-Li F., Xu, S.-Q. Dews M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we used fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis to show that the same cell lines used in the present experiments underwent apoptosis after IL-3 withdrawal. We confirmed apoptosis by the TUNEL method in a subsequent paper (4Peruzzi F. Prisco M. Dews M. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Romano G. Calabretta B. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7203-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). We have monitored the extent of apoptosis in the present experiments, and they exactly reproduced the data of Zhou-Li et al. (3Zhou-Li F., Xu, S.-Q. Dews M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Those data had shown that a sizable fraction of 32D/T cells are already dead at 16 h after IL-3 withdrawal, whereas death of 32D IRS-1 cells was delayed and less prominent. The number of apoptotic cells was negligible in 32D IRS-1/T cells or in 32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells (3Zhou-Li F., Xu, S.-Q. Dews M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 4Peruzzi F. Prisco M. Dews M. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Romano G. Calabretta B. Baserga R. Mol. Cell.

All 32D-derived cells grow normally if incubated in IL-3 (not shown, but repeatedly shown in previous papers). IRS-1 is known to interact directly with both the insulin and the IGF-I receptors, and the domains required for their interaction have been identified (27Yenush L. Zanella C. Uchida T. Bernal D. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because of its direct interaction with the receptors, its size, and its downstream signaling, it has been generally assumed that IRS-1 is an exclusively cytosolic (or plasma membrane) protein (for the most recent references, see Refs. 28Razzini G. Ingrosso A. Brancaccio A. Sciacchitano S. Esposito D.L. Falasca M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 823-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and 29Jacobs A.R. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40795-40802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, as already mentioned, IRS-1 is known to interact with the SV40 T antigen (3Zhou-Li F., Xu, S.-Q. Dews M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Zhou-Li F. D'Ambrosio C., Li, S. Surmacz E. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4232-4239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and nucleolin (14Burks D.J. Wang J. Towery H. Ishibashi O. Lowe D. Riedel H. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31061-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These two proteins are predominantly nuclear proteins. In addition, a recent report (18Lassak A. Del Valle L. Peruzzi F. Wang J.Y. Enam S. Croul S. Khalili K. Reiss K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17231-17238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) has shown that IRS-1 can translocate to the nuclei in medulloblastoma cells and cell lines. In an attempt to explain the co-operative effect of SV40 T antigen and IRS-1, we have investigated their localization in 32D cells. Fig. 1 shows confocal and regular microscopy pictures of 32D-derived cells, stained with the appropriate antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”). 32D cells (and derivatives) growing in IL-3 have the appearance of blast cells, with large nuclei, large and often diffuse nucleoli, and a variable rim of cytoplasm around the large nuclei (7Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Fig.1A shows that 32D/T cells are completely negative for IRS-1 staining, as expected from the fact that parental 32D cells do not express IRS-1 (6Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 7Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In 32D IRS-1 cells (3Zhou-Li F., Xu, S.-Q. Dews M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), IRS-1 is detectable (Santa Cruz antibody) in cells growing in complete medium plus IL-3 (Fig. 1B). The nucleus was stained with hematoxylin, and IRS-1 clearly appears localized in the cytoplasm of these cells. The amount of IRS-1 in the cytosol of individual cells varies, which can be explained by the fact that this is a mixed population. When the amount of IRS-1 is substantial, the color of the nucleus is darker, as one would expect, in immunohistochemistry, from cells in which the nucleus is covered by a thin layer of cytosol. The average amount of IRS-1 in these cells, as detectable by Western blots, is high (7Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These results were confirmed by confocal microscopy. Fig. 1C shows that the T antigen is a nuclear protein in 32D/T cells, the amount detectable in the cytosol (stained for clathrin) being negligible. Parental 32D cells do not stain at all with an antibody to the T antigen (not shown). Fig.1D shows a 32D/IRS-1 cell in which IRS-1 (green) is limited to the cytoplasmic rim, whereas the antibody to nucleolin (red) stains the nucleus diffusely. Fig. 1E shows another example of a 32D/IRS-1 cell, but with the colors reversed (IRS-1 is now stained red and nucleolin green). These experiments were repeated several times, with reproducible results. In contrast, when the same antibodies are used to stain 32D IRS-1/T cells, IRS-1 is now seen predominantly in the nucleus, co-localizing with the T antigen (Fig.2). A halo of IRS-1 can still be seen in the cytosol, but a substantial proportion of IRS-1 is now in the nucleus. The images of A and B of Fig. 2 were obtained using two different antibodies for IRS-1, from different commercial sources (see above). To pinpoint the localization, we show in Fig. 2 isolated cells, but the great majority of 32D IRS-1/T cells showed nuclear co-localization of the two proteins (see also below). The results are consistent with nuclear localization of IRS-1 in 32D cells expressing T antigen. With the results of Fig. 1, we can also state that IRS-1 is not required for the localization in the nuclei of T antigen, whereas T antigen is needed for the nuclear localization of IRS-1. However, the nuclear localization of IRS-1 is not limited to T antigen expressing cells. 32D IRS-1/IGF-IR cells are transformed by any criteria, because they form tumors in nude mice (11Valentinis B. Navarro M. Zanocco-Marani T. Edmonds P. McCormick J. Morrione A. Sacchi A. Romano G. Reiss K. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25451-25459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy (Fig. 3) shows that IRS-1 in these cells co-localized with nucleolin, predominantly in the nucleus. In these cells, nucleolin gives a diffuse nuclear staining, which is at variance with MEF, where the anti-nucleolin antibodies give a discrete nucleolar-shaped staining. A weak halo of IRS-1 is also detectable in the cytosol. Therefore, ectopically expressed IRS-1 is cytosolic in 32D/IRS-1 cells but mostly nuclear when the cells also express either the T antigen or increased levels of IGF-IR. Because of often justified doubts on the specificity of commercial antibodies (especially in immunohistochemistry), we have attempted to confirm our results by using a FLAG-tagged IRS-1. This is a plasmid in which mouse IRS-1 (30Keller S.R. Aebersold R. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. Biocheim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) is tagged with a FLAG epitope at its 3′ end (see “Experimental Procedures”). This plasmid was transiently transfected into 32D/T cells, and the cells were examined 48 h later. Because the efficiency of transfection of parental and derived 32D cells is fairly low, this transient expression experiment offered the advantage of using the untransfected cells as controls for the FLAG epitope. Untransfected cells are negative for the FLAG epitope and stain only with the Id2 antibody (Id2 is a nuclear protein). Fig.4 shows different experiments in which 32D/T ce"

Site-directed mutagenesis of residues in three surface loops of a positive exosite located on APC was used to identify residues that play a significant role in binding to FVa. Eighteen different residues were mutated to alanine singly, in pairs, or in triple mutation combinations. Mutant APC proteins were purified and characterized for their inactivation of FVa. Three APC residues were identified that provide major contributions to FVa interactions: Lys193, Arg229, and Arg230. In addition, four residues made significant minor contributions to FVa interactions: Lys191, Lys192, Asp214, and Glu215. All of these residues primarily contribute to APC cleavage at Arg506 in FVa and play a small role in the interaction of APC with the Arg306 cleavage site. In conjunction with previously published work, these results define an extensive FVa binding site in the positive exosite of APC that is primarily involved in binding and cleaving at Arg506 on FVa.

Protein C circulates in the blood as an inactive serine protease zymogen that is activated by thrombin when it is complexed with thrombomodulin on the surface of endothelial cells (1Kisiel W. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 2Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mollica J.S. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). APC then inactivates the procoagulant cofactors factor Va (FVa) and factor VIIIa via specific cleavages of these proteins (3Kisiel W. Canfield W.M. Ericsson L.H. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5824-5831Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 4Walker F.J. Sexton P.W. Esmon C.T. Biochim. Biophys.

Recent evidence suggests that a basic exosite located on APC is critical for recognition and inactivation of FVa. This exosite was first recognized in a molecular model of the serine-protease domain of APC and was proposed to be a likely candidate for protein-protein interactions (6Fisher C.L. Greengard J.S. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 588-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The presence of the exosite was confirmed in the x-ray crystallographic structure of the gla-domainless APC (7Mather T. Oganessyan V. Hof P. Huber R. Foundling S. Esmon C. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6822-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The exosite is generally located in the same position as anion binding exosite I of thrombin, an exosite that is involved in a variety of thrombin-protein interactions. Subsequently, studies have been done to characterize the interactions of this exosite with the APC substrate, FVa. Peptide inhibition studies clearly implicated the autolysis loop (residues 301–316, chymotrypsin (CHT) residues 142–153) in binding of APC to FVa (8Mesters R.M. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1482-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Alanine scanning of individual residues in this loop was used to identify residues Arg306, Lys311, Arg312, and Arg314 as critical residues in the interaction of APC with FVa. Furthermore, these residues are primarily involved in interactions with the Arg506 cleavage site on FVa, and mutation of them has little effect on Arg306cleavage (9Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another study determined that the naturally occurring type II APC mutation of Arg352 to Trp (CHT 187) results in defective FVa inactivation as well (10Rintelen C. Yegneswaran S. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Residues in loop 37 (CHT 37–39) were also determined to be important for FVa Arg506cleavage, whereas one mutation in the calcium binding loop (CHT 70–80) at Arg229 (CHT 74) and mutations in loop 60 (CHT 60–67) had little effect on FVa inactivation (11Friedrich U. Nicolaes G.A.F. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23105-23108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Studies have also implicated this positive exosite in interactions with thrombomodulin and heparin (12Knobe K.E. Berntsdotter A. Shen L. Morser J. Dahlback B. Villoutreix B.O. Proteins. 1999; 35: 218-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Friedrich U. Blom A.M. Dahlback B. Villoutreix B.O. J. Biol.

As a continuation of our autolysis loop studies, we undertook a complete alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the remaining surface loops in the basic exosite of APC (Fig. 1). We inspected the crystal structure of gla-domainless APC to verify that candidate residues were on the surface of APC and mutated every surface-exposed residue in these loops to alanine, either singly or in pairs. Additionally we made double and triple mutation combinations of some individual mutations that had negative effects. In loop 37, which contains residues 190–193 (CHT 36–39), residues Ser190, Lys191, Lys192, and Lys193 were mutated. In loop 60, which contains residues 214–222 (CHT 60–68), residues Asp214, Glu215, Lys217, Lys218, and Arg222 were mutated. In the calcium-binding loop, which contains residues 225–235 (CHT 70–80), residues Asp227, Arg229, Arg230, Trp231, Glu232, Lys233, and Trp234 were mutated. Combined with previously published work (9Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rintelen C. Yegneswaran S. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), analysis of these mutations allowed us to define an extensive binding site for FVa in the positive exosite of APC. FVa and Gln506-FVa were prepared as described (14Heeb M.J. Kojima Y. Greengard J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1995; 85: 3405-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Heeb M.J. Mesters R.M. Tans G. Rosing J. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2872-2877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FXa was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Phospholipid vesicles (80% phosphatidylcholine, 20% phosphatidylserine) were prepared as described (16Mesters R.M. Houghten R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chromogenic substrate H-d-lysyl (g-Cbo)-prolyl-argininyl-p-nitroanilide (Pefachrome PCa) was purchased from Centerchem, Inc. (Norwalk, CT). The chromogenic substrate CBS 34-47 was purchased from American Bioproducts (Parsippany, NJ). Normal human citrate-anticoagulated plasma was purchased from George King Bio-Medical, Inc. (Overland Park, KS). Mutant protein C expression vectors were constructed as described (17Zhang L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10828-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant protein C was prepared as described using a fast flow Q-Sepharose column (9Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhang L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10828-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Some preparations of recombinant protein C were purified further by chromatography on a calcium-dependent sheep polyclonal anti-protein C antibody-Sepharose column (18Gruber A. Harker L.A. Hanson S.R. Kelly A.B. Griffin J.H. Circulation. 1991; 84: 2454-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as described (9Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Final concentration of protein C was determined using the Asserachrom Protein C enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay from American Bioproducts (Parsippany, NJ). Protein C was activated by thrombin. Protein C in HBS (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl) with 2 mm EDTA and 0.5% BSA, pH 7.4, at a concentration of 600 μg/ml was incubated for 2.5 h with 12 μg/ml thrombin at 37 °C followed by the addition of 1.1 units of hirudin per unit of thrombin to inactivate the thrombin. Controls were done in amidolytic assays, clotting assays, and FVa inactivation assays to verify that the thrombin and hirudin used had no effect on subsequent assays. All APC mutants were quantitated using an active site titration adapted from Chase and Shaw (19Chase T. Shaw E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) using APC at ∼8 μm in HBS andp-nitrophenol-guanidino benzoate at 0.1 mm with an extinction coefficient for p-nitrophenol of 11,400m−1 cm−1 calculated for pH 7.4.K m and k cat for the chromogenic substrate, Pefachrome PCa, were determined by varying substrate concentration from 1.43 to 0.0446 mm in HBS, 0.5% BSA, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 with APC at 5.7 nm. Michaelis constants were derived using Eadie-Hofstee plots. Alternatively, the 5 mm CaCl2 was replaced with 5 mm EDTA for similar determinations. Color development was measured with an Optimax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) (16Mesters R.M. Houghten R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dilute prothrombin time clotting assays were performed according to the following procedure. Plasma (50 μl) was incubated with 50 μl of APC in HBS with 0.5% BSA at APC concentrations from 8 to 32 nm(2.7–11 nm final concentration) for 3 min at 37 °C. Then clotting was initiated by adding 50 μl of Innovin (Dade Behring Inc., Newark, DE) diluted 1:60 in HBS, 0.5% BSA, and 25 mmCaCl2. The clotting time was measured using an ST4 coagulometer (Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres, France). APC inactivation by serpins present in plasma was measured essentially according to the protocol of Heeb et al. (20Heeb M.J. Bischoff R. Courtney M. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2365-2369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of FVa was measured according to the following procedure. A mixture of 1 nm FVa with 25 μm phospholipid vesicles was made in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% BSA, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm MnCl2. Inactivation was initiated by the addition of APC. One-microliter aliquots were removed at time points and added to 40 μl containing 1.25 nm factor Xa (FXa) with 31 μm phospholipid vesicles, followed by the addition of 10 μl of 3 μm prothrombin (final concentrations: 1 nm FXa, 20 pm FVa, 25 μm phospholipid vesicles, and 0.6 μmprothrombin). After 2.5 min a 15-μl aliquot of this mixture was quenched by the addition to 55 μl of HBS containing 10 mmEDTA, 0.5% BSA, pH 8.2. Chromogenic substrate CBS 34-47 was added, and the rate of thrombin formation was assessed by measuring the change in absorbance at 405 nm. Curve fitting of the pseudo-first order time courses of FVa inactivation was done according to Nicolaes et al. (21Nicolaes G.A.F. Tans G. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21158-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) as described (9Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). k 506 is the apparent second-order rate constant for cleavage at Arg506 in native FVa,k 306 is the apparent second-order rate constant for cleavage at Arg306 in FVaint, and k306′ is the apparent second-order rate constant for cleavage at Arg306 in intact FVa. k306′ was determined from the inactivation time courses of Gln506-FVa fit to a single exponential and was taken as a constant in determination ofk 506 and k 306. Data were fit to the equations using nonlinear least-squares regression analysis. Wild type and mutant recombinant protein C were recovered at levels varying from 0.1 to 1.5 mg/liter of conditioned medium. After purification, recombinant protein concentrations were determined by ELISA. Silver-stained gels showed that the proteins appeared to be 75–95% pure (data not shown) and also showed no apparent changes in molecular mass (62 kDa) for the mutants with respect to wild type recombinant protein C. Protein C was activated with thrombin as described under “Materials and Methods,” and concentration of APC was determined by active site titration with p-nitrophenol guanidino-benzoate. Following active site titration, standard curves for activity with the amidolytic substrate Pefachrome PCa were performed, and this amidolytic assay was used to determine the activity of samples immediately prior to use in all subsequent assays. K m andk cat for the substrate Pefachrome PCa were derived from titrations of substrate in HBS with 0.5% BSA and 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 (TableI). For APC containing mutants in the calcium-binding loop, K m andk cat were also determined in the same buffer except that the CaCl2 was replaced with 5 mmEDTA. Negligible changes in K m andk cat for this small chromogenic substrate are taken to suggest that mutation did not result in a major structural defect in the protein that would complicate interpretation of any functional results.Table IKm and kcat of APCs for pefachrome PCaMutant5 mm EDTA5 mm CaCl2K mk catK mk catmmsec−1mmsec−1Wild-type.39450.4364S190A.4066K191A.4268K192A.3354K193A.4059K191A/K192A/K193A.4590D214A/E215A.3571K217A/K218A.4975R222A1.371051.41124D227A1.4186.88129R229A.5250.4469R230A.4337.4553R229A/R230A.4060.4679W231A.3778.44102K233A.4553.4063E232A/W234A.4645.4971Mutant APCs were reacted with the chromogenic substrate pefachrome PCa at an APC concentration of 5.7 nm and substrate concentration from 0.045 to 1.43 mm in HBS, 0.5% BSA, and either EDTA or CaCl2. Open table in a new tab Mutant APCs were reacted with the chromogenic substrate pefachrome PCa at an APC concentration of 5.7 nm and substrate concentration from 0.045 to 1.43 mm in HBS, 0.5% BSA, and either EDTA or CaCl2. Most of the mutant APCs did not significantly differ from wild type in their K m and k cat for Pefachrome PCa. Only four mutants had notable differences. First, the mutation W231A had an increased k cat both in the presence and the absence of CaCl2; however, theK m was unchanged. The APC mutant K191A/K192A/K193A also had an increased k cat. The mutant R222A had a large change in both K m andk cat in the presence and absence of CaCl2. Finally, the mutant D227A had significantly altered kinetic parameters for cleavage of Pefachrome PCa, but in this case the difference in K m from wild type was smaller in the presence of CaCl2 than it was in the presence of EDTA. This suggests that this mutation had some effect on calcium binding. In fact, the backbone carbonyl of Asp227 is proposed to be a calcium ligand (6Fisher C.L. Greengard J.S. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 588-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), so it is not unexpected that mutation of this residue could affect calcium binding. Alterations in the APC amidolytic activity caused by these two mutations (Arg222 and Arg227) suggest that the conformation of the mutant is compromised in some way such that it is not possible to definitively ascribe changes in anticoagulant function to altered APC-FVa interactions. Therefore, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the interactions of these two residues with factor Va. To further confirm that the mutations with effects on FVa inactivation rates did not have significant changes in APC active site functional activity, several mutants and wild type APC were assayed for their rate of inactivation in plasma, which primarily reflects inactivation of APC by the serpins, α-1-antitrypsin (AAT), and protein C inhibitor (22Heeb M.J. España F. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1989; 73: 446-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type APC activity had a half-life (t 12) for inactivation in plasma of 21.4 min. The APC mutants D214E/A215A (t 12 = 24.1), R229A (t 12 = 18.8), R230A (t 12 = 23.6), R229A/R230A (t 12 = 27.5), and K191A/K192A/K193A (t 12 = 21.0) had half-lives in plasma that were very similar to that of wild type APC. In contrast, the two APC mutants that appeared to have perturbations of the active site, R222A (t 12 = 208 min) and D227A (t 12= 83.0 min), were clearly defective in their inactivation by serpins, further confirming that these proteins have global conformational changes that affect active site interactions with various substrates. All of the mutant APCs were evaluated for anticoagulant function in a dilute prothrombin time assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” This assay is highly sensitive to factor V activity in plasma, but controls were done to verify that it is insensitive to factor VIII activity as well as factor IX activity (data not shown), confirming that this assay reflects APC inactivation of FVa. Fig.2 A shows the anticoagulant activity of selected APC mutants. Mutation of Arg229 or Arg230 to Ala significantly decreased the anticoagulant activity with a somewhat greater effect for R229A. The double mutation of R229A/R230A had an even larger decrease in anticoagulant activity. The anticoagulant activity of each APC mutant was estimated from Fig.2 A and from identical experiments for other APC mutants (data not shown), and anticoagulant activity of each mutant is shown in Fig. 3 as a percentage of wild type. Although, in the calcium-binding loop mutations at residues Arg229 and Arg230 markedly decreased APC activity, mutation of residues Trp231, Glu232, Lys233, and Trp234 did not have any negative effect on anticoagulant activity. Therefore, it would appear that these residues do not have a significant role in FVa recognition by APC. As seen in Fig. 3, specific Lys residues in loop 37, especially Lys193, are essential for normal anticoagulant activity, whereas Ser190 has no role in anticoagulant activity. In loop 60, residues Asp214 and Glu215 moderately contribute to anticoagulant activity, while Lys217 and Lys218 have no significant role in anticoagulant activity. Mutation of Arg222 to Ala greatly reduced anticoagulant activity, but, as noted above, this mutation altered amidolytic activity, so it likely caused a global structural perturbation of APC. Although the reduction in anticoagulant activity observed for R222A may be because of loss of a specific binding interaction between APC and FVa, we cannot draw any conclusion because global structural perturbations could have the same effect. In the calcium-binding loop, mutation of Asp227 also had a moderate effect on anticoagulant activity, but, as was the case for R222A, this mutation altered amidolytic activity and appeared to cause structural perturbations of APC. Furthermore, it is likely that this mutation affected calcium ion binding. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions about the role of Asp227 in FVa inactivation. To define effects of mutations on specific cleavages in FVa by APC, we studied FVa inactivation in a purified system. Fig. 2 B shows results from experiments using normal plasma-derived FVa. Cleavage rate constants for Arg506 and Arg306 cleavages by each APC mutant were derived from inactivation time courses according to established equations (9Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Nicolaes G.A.F. Tans G. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21158-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Wild type APC had a value fork 506 (Arg506 cleavage) of 93 × 106m−1 sec−1. Fig.4 A showsk 506 values for wild type and mutant APCs. Wild type APC had a value for k 306(Arg306 cleavage following Arg506 cleavage) of 3.0 × 106m−1sec−1. Fig. 4 B showsk 306 values for wild type and mutant APCs. The cleavage rate for Arg306 cleavage in the absence of Arg506 cleavage ( k306′) was also determined for all APC mutants by measuring cleavage of plasma-derived Gln506-FVa. The value of k306′ for wild type APC was 1.7 × 106m−1sec−1. This value was about 60% of the value ofk 306, and all APC mutants gave similar values for k306′ relative to their respective k 306, values (data not shown). Consistent with previously published data (9Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Nicolaes G.A.F. Tans G. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21158-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), this suggests that cleavage at Arg506 modestly enhances the rate of cleavage at Arg306. From Fig. 2 B and Fig. 4 A it is clear that both the R229A and the R230A mutations had large effects in decreasing the FVa Arg506 cleavage rate constants, and the double mutation R229A/R230A had an even larger effect. Fig. 4 A also shows that the mutation K193A had a large effect on the Arg506cleavage rate constant, whereas the mutations K191A and K192A had only moderate effects. In contrast, the double mutation D214A/E215A increased the rate constant for Arg306 cleavage but not for Arg506 cleavage. With that exception, the effects of most of these mutations were largest for cleavage at Arg506(k 506) and apparently much less for cleavage at Arg306 (k 306, Fig. 4). This selective effect of these mutations in APC on the Arg506cleavage is illustrated in Fig. 4 C, where the ratio of the Arg506 cleavage rate constant (k 506) to the Arg306 cleavage rate constant (k 306) is shown for wild type and mutant APCs. Wild type APC cleaves Arg506 (k 506) 31× faster than it cleaves Arg306 following Arg506 cleavage (k 306). APC mutants that had reduced activity mainly lost activity for Arg506cleavage. This is reflected in the reduced ratio (k 506/k 306, Fig.4 C). This reduced ratio is clear for the mutations K193A, R229A, and R230A. The triple mutation, K191A/K192A/K193A, had an even greater reduction in ratio in an apparent additive effect of the three individual mutations. The double mutation R229A/R230A also manifested an additive effect of the two individual mutations. This graph indicates that the double mutation D214A/E215A had a significant effect on the ratio of k 506 tok 306. But, as noted above, this is apparently because of an increase in the Arg306 cleavage rate rather than a decrease in the Arg506 cleavage rate. Mutational analysis using conservative alanine mutations to probe protein-protein interactions is a well established method for characterizing the molecular details of the interaction (9Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, it cannot be conclusively ruled out that mutations alter folding properties of the protein or exert their effects at a distance from the interaction site rather than alter a specific protein-protein interaction. To minimize this possibility, we analyzed the kinetic parameters of mutant APCs for cleavage of a small chromogenic substrate (Table I), and for selected APC mutants we also measured the rate of inactivation by plasma serpins. In both cases, kinetic parameters equivalent to those of wild type APC suggest that no gross structural changes were caused by the mutations. As exceptions, significant changes in these parameters for two mutants (R222A and D227A) caused us to remove them from consideration in our structure-function analysis. In support of this, the x-ray crystallographic structure of APC (7Mather T. Oganessyan V. Hof P. Huber R. Foundling S. Esmon C. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6822-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) illustrates that all of these mutated residues are fully surface exposed, except for Arg222 and Asp227, which are only partially exposed, so mutation of them might be expected to have structural consequences. Therefore, for the remaining mutants, it is reasonable to assume that functional changes caused by mutations are the result of alteration of specific protein-protein interactions. Accordingly, our results provide insights into APC exosite interactions with FVa. Residues Arg229, Arg230, and Lys193 play the largest role in FVa interactions, whereas residues Lys191, Lys192, Asp214, and Glu215 appear to play minor roles. The rate of cleavage at Arg506 in FVa is significantly affected by mutation of each of these residues, whereas cleavage at Arg306 is only mildly affected. Conversely, residues Lys217, Lys218, Trp231, Glu232, Lys233, and Trp234 do not appear to play any significant role in FVa interactions with APC. Friedrich et al. (11Friedrich U. Nicolaes G.A.F. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23105-23108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) mutated Arg229 (CHT 74) to Gln, a naturally occurring type II protein C mutation, and concluded that this residue played, at most, a minor role in the interaction of APC with the Arg506 cleavage site of FVa. This is in contrast to the significant reduction in APC activity we observed here for the R229A mutant. But the mutation was not the same, so direct comparison is not possible. In fact, both naturally occurring mutations of Arg229 (R229Q and R229W) are still potential hydrogen bond donors. In contrast, the mutation R229A removes all hydrogen bonding possibility at residue 229. Therefore, it is possible that these mutations (R229Q and R229W) maintain part of the functional contact provided by Arg229, which could also involve hydrogen bonding. Thus, mutation to these naturally occurring mutants, while reflecting what happens in individuals with these mutations, would not necessarily elucidate the normal functional role of the wild type Arg229 in FVa interactions. We conclude that Arg229 does indeed play a significant role in interactions of APC with FVa. Furthermore, Arg230 clearly plays a significant role in interactions of APC with FVa. Thus, the calcium-binding loop is central in the interaction of APC with FVa. Friedrich et al. (11Friedrich U. Nicolaes G.A.F. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23105-23108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) also concluded that residues Lys191, Lys192, and Lys193 (CHT 37–39) were involved in cleavage of Arg506 in FVa by APC, whereas residues Lys217 and Lys218 (CHT 62 and 63) were not involved in this interaction. This agrees well with our results, but we mutated residues 191, 192, and 193 individually as well as together, whereas Friedrich et al. (11Friedrich U. Nicolaes G.A.F. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23105-23108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) only mutated them all at once. From these individual mutations we were able to determine that the three Lys residues did not contribute equally to this interaction. Rather, Lys193 played the largest role in the interaction of APC with FVa. In a previous study (9Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we identified several residues in the autolysis loop of APC (residues 301–316, equivalent to chymotrypsin 142–153) that also play a very significant role in FVa interactions and further distinguish between cleavages at Arg506 and Arg306. This surface loop is also part of the extended positive exosite on APC, and these residues are nearly contiguous in tertiary space with the residues identified in the current study as FVa binding residues. Another residue, Arg352, identified as a site for FVa interaction, is also contiguous with the positive exosite (10Rintelen C. Yegneswaran S. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Together these studies map out an extended FVa binding site on APC that arches around the active site triad of the serine protease but does not indiscriminately involve the entire so-called positive exosite, as various residues that define the positive exosite, such as Lys217, Lys218, and Lys233, as well as other non-positive residues that fall within this area, such as Ser190, Trp231, Glu232, Trp234, and Glu309, do not appear to play significant direct roles in FVa interactions. The correspondence of anticoagulant plasma-based assay data (dilute prothrombin time assay) with FVa inactivation rate constant data was generally excellent, with one significant exception. The mutation D214A/E215A had a k 506 value that was similar to the wild type value and a k 306 value that was almost double the wild type value, whereas its anticoagulant activity was about 50% of wild type. We ruled out the possibility that this mutation plays a role in other APC interactions that are present only in the plasma-based assay, such as with protein S, factor VIII, or serpin inhibitors. The dilute prothrombin time anticoagulant assay was done in FVIII-deficient plasma and protein S-deficient plasma (data not shown), and the same relative loss of activity was seen in both assays, confirming that the defect of D214A/E215A in plasma was not due to interactions with FVIII or protein S. Also, as mentioned, the rates of inactivation of wild type APC and D214A/E215A APC that were measured in plasma were virtually identical. It is possible that the proximity of these residues to the catalytic triad, both in sequence and in tertiary structure, plays a role in the difference between clotting activity and FVa inactivation activity. We suggest that residues Asp214and Glu215 may have a minor role in FVa interactions. It is intriguing that most of the mutants presented in this work and others (9Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Friedrich U. Nicolaes G.A.F. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. J. Biol.

Pellequer et al. (25Pellequer J.L. Gale A.J. Getzoff E.D. Griffin J.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) modeled APC bound to the Arg506 cleavage site, and the model showed extensive contacts between the positive exosite of APC and FVa with Arg506 bound in the S1 site of APC. This APC/FVa model allowed for contacts with certain basic residues of the APC autolysis loop that were suggested by mutation to be involved in FVa binding (9Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and it also allowed that Arg229 and Arg230could interact with FVa. In addition loop 37 (Lys191, Lys192, and Lys193) was modeled to be in contact with FVa. The data in this paper are consistent with Pellequer's APC/FVa complex model because we show that Lys193, Arg229, and Arg230 are all critical for interactions with FVa during cleavage of Arg506. In summary, including our previous work (9Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have now identified a total of seven residues in the positive exosite of APC that appear to play a major role in FVa binding (Lys193, Arg229, Arg230, Arg306, Lys311, Arg312, and Arg314) and at least four that appear to play a minor but significant role (Lys217, Lys218, Lys307, and Glu308), with two more at the periphery of the positive exosite that may play a minor role (Asp214 and Glu215). These results serve to outline an extensive FVa binding exosite on the surface of the protease domain of APC. In future work it will be interesting to see how this FVa binding exosite compares to exosites for other APC/PC molecular partners such as thrombomodulin and FVIIIa.

The formation of these complexes (also termed enhanceosomes) is primarily driven by the sequence-specific binding of transcription factors to their cis-acting DNA target sites. Post-translational modifications and various protein/protein interactions modulate the assembly of the regulatory nucleoprotein structures (1Beckett D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 335-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because of the structural inflexibility of the DNA, the interaction of transcriptional regulators tethered by DNA often requires the assistance of architectural factors. Due to their DNA bending activity, they can facilitate the coordinated and stereo-specific assembly of the nucleoprotein complexes (2Bustin M. Mol. Cell.

Sci. 2001; 26: 152-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). They contain one or two copies of the HMG-box DNA binding domain, which consists mainly of three α-helices, arranged in an L-shaped structure (6Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem.

HMGB proteins share many properties with the structurally unrelated prokaryotic HU proteins, such as the interaction with the minor groove of DNA, bending the DNA by over 90°, and the recognition of distorted DNA sequences (5Grosschedl R.

The HMGB proteins are no classical transcriptional activators (11Landsman D. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4483-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but nevertheless they have been implicated in the regulation of transcription (12Singh J. Dixon G.H.

Furthermore, HMGB proteins interfere with the formation of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex by interactions with the basal transcription machinery (23Das D. Scovell W.M. J. Biol.

In line with these findings, the HMGB-type proteins NHP6A/B play an important regulatory role, repressing as well as potentiating the expression of various genes in yeast (28Moreira J.M.A. Holmberg S.

Both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants contain several relatively abundant chromosomal HMGB proteins (30Grasser K.D. Krohn N.M. Lichota J. Stemmer C. Physiol.

Thus, five HMGB proteins have been identified and characterized from maize andArabidopsis (30Grasser K.D. Krohn N.M. Lichota J. Stemmer C. Physiol. Plant. 2000; 110: 427-435Crossref Google Scholar). They differ from each other in their chromatin association, in their post-translational modifications and in some of their DNA interactions (32Lichota J. Grasser K.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7860-7867Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33Ritt C. Grimm R. Fernández S. Alonso J.C. Grasser K.D.

Plant HMGB proteins typically have a single HMG-box DNA binding domain, which is flanked by a basic N-terminal and an acidic C-terminal domain. While the HMG-box domains of the different HMGB proteins are relatively conserved, the basic and acidic flanking regions are more variable in length and sequence (35Grasser K.D. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 260-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An HMGB protein from wheat has been shown to stimulate the binding of the bZIP factor EmBP-1 to its DNA recognition site (36Schultz T.F. Spiker S. Quatrano R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25742-25745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the maize HMGB1 protein can physically interact with the transcription factors Dof1 and Dof2 and facilitates the DNA binding of Dof1 (37Yanagisawa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The Dof factors represent a plant-specific family of transcription factors that contain a transcriptional activation domain and a highly conserved amino acid sequence termed the Dof domain, which may form a single zinc finger critical for DNA binding (38Yanagisawa S. Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1: 213-214Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 39Yanagisawa S. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Dof proteins recognize specifically the AAAG core motif occurring in different promoter regions (40Yanagisawa S. Schmidt R.J.

Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 2241-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Since little is known about the specificity of the interactions between HMGB proteins and transcription factors, we have taken advantage of the variability of HMGB proteins in plants (30Grasser K.D. Krohn N.M. Lichota J. Stemmer C. Physiol. Plant. 2000; 110: 427-435Crossref Google Scholar, 35Grasser K.D. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 260-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to examine biochemically the specificity of the interaction between Dof2 and the various maize HMGB proteins HMGB1, HMGB2/3, HMGB4, and HMGB5 (previously termed HMGa, HMGc1/2, HMGd, HMGe). It is shown that the HMG-box domain is sufficient for the interaction with Dof2 and that HMGB5 is markedly more efficient than HMGB1, HMGB2/3, and HMGB4 in stimulating the binding of Dof2 to its DNA recognition sequence. Moreover, the phosphorylation of HMGB1 by protein kinase CK2 abolishes the interaction with Dof2. The various maize HMGB proteins and the truncated versions of HMGB1 were expressed as His6-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli and purified by three-step column chromatography as described previously (49Grasser K.D. Grimm R. Ritt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32900-32906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 50Ritt C. Grimm R. Fernández S. Alonso J.C. Grasser K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2673-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The fusion protein of the Dof domain of maize Dof2 with an N-terminal GST and a C-terminal His tag, here termed GST-ΔDof2, was expressed in Escherichia coliand purified as described previously (37Yanagisawa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For control experiments, the GST protein (without ΔDof2 fusion) was expressed in E. coli, using the original plasmid pGEX-5X-1 and purified as descibed by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA sequence encoding the Dof domain of Dof2 (K1-E115) was amplified by PCR with Deep Vent DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) and primers P1 (5′-AAGGATCCAAGGGCTACCCCGT) and P2 (5′-AACTGCAGCTCCGGGGCAGGCGCGA) using the plasmid pGST-Dof2 (37Yanagisawa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) as template. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and PstI and cloned into the expression vector pQE9 cm (49Grasser K.D. Grimm R. Ritt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32900-32906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) giving pQE9 cm-ΔDof2, which was checked by DNA sequencing. The His6-tagged ΔDof2 was expressed in E. coli and purified by metal-chelate chromatography as described previously (37Yanagisawa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 49Grasser K.D. Grimm R. Ritt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32900-32906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Maize protein kinase CK2α was expressed in E. coli and purified by three-step column chromatography. The enzyme was used to phosphorylate HMGB1 and HMGB3 within their acidic C-terminal domains as described previously (34Stemmer C. Schwander A. Bauw G. Fojan P. Grasser K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1092-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). GST-tagged ΔDof2 protein (500 ng) was incubated for 10 min in a total volume of 100 μl with 50 μl of a 50% glutathione-Sepharose-bead slurry prepared and equilibrated as specified by the supplier (Amersham Biosciences). After centrifugation the supernatant was discarded, and the proteins tested for interaction with ΔDof2 were added (∼500 ng) in a final volume of 150 μl. After incubation at 20 °C for 1 h, the Sepharose beads were washed four times with 100 μl of NaCl/Pi (4.3 mmNa2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P40). Bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione, precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid, washed twice with acetone, dried, and resuspended in SDS loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE in 18% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and documented with the FluorS (Bio-Rad) digital camera system. The ΔDof2 protein (600 ng) was incubated for 5 min at 20 °C with the HMGB proteins (∼600 ng) in NaCl/Pi in a final volume of 16 μl. Some cross-linking reactions contained also DNA, either 200 ng of the 21-bp Dof site oligonucleotide (37Yanagisawa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or 200 ng of an unrelated 21-bp oligonucleotide containing no sequence that matches Dof binding sites (40Yanagisawa S. Schmidt R.J. Plant J. 1999; 17: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The cross-linking reaction was started by adding glutaraldehyde to a final concentration of 0.0125%. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-loading buffer and heating the samples for 2 min at 95 °C. Cross-linking of proteins with disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was performed as described previously (50Ritt C. Grimm R. Fernández S. Alonso J.C. Grasser K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2673-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 18% polyacrylamide gels, which were stained with Coomassie and documented with the FluorS (Bio-Rad) system and analyzed using the ImageQuant software. Protein binding to a double-stranded32P-labeled 21-bp Dof site oligonucleotide containing the Dof binding site (37Yanagisawa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was examined using EMSAs. Binding reactions contained binding buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol) and 40-fold excess of poly(dI-dC) as non-specific competitor DNA. In the standard binding reactions, GST-ΔDof2 (10 nm) and the respective HMGB protein (0–1 μm) were preincubated for 5 min prior to the addition of the oligonucleotide (3.5 nm). In some assays, GST-ΔDof2 and the oligonucleotide were preincubated for 5 min before the HMGB protein was added. After a final incubation for 5 min, the samples were applied onto 7% polyacrylamide gels in 1 × TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA). When electrophoresis was completed, the gels were dried under vacuum and autoradiographed and/or analyzed with a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). In the experiments, which were performed to determine the composition of the protein-DNA complex, the analytical ΔDof2/HMGB5/Dof site oligonucleotide binding reaction used in EMSAs (described above) was scaled up as described in the cross-linking experiments and analyzed by preparative PAGE. The gels were stained with SYBR gold (Molecular Probes), and the band corresponding to the protein-DNA complex was cut from the gel. The excised polyacrylamide gel slice was soaked in SDS-loading buffer, inserted in the well of a 18% polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. It has been shown previously that the maize HMGB1 protein interacts with the maize transcription factors Dof1 and Dof2 and that HMGB1 can stimulate the DNA binding of Dof1. The interaction with HMGB1 is mediated by the Dof domain of the Dof1 protein (37Yanagisawa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Using full-length HMGB1 in comparison with truncated versions of the protein, we have analyzed here which domain(s) of HMGB1 is/are involved in the interaction with a Dof2-glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein (GST-ΔDof2). The HMGB1 protein or truncated derivatives of HMGB1 (as indicated in Fig.1A) were incubated with GST-ΔDof2 bound to glutathione-Sepharose. The glutathione-Sepharose was thoroughly washed and the proteins bound to the matrix through the GST fusion portion were eluted with glutathione. In control experiments, no HMGB1 protein binding was detected when the GST protein (without ΔDof2 fusion) was used. The GST-ΔDof2 fusion protein was bound by full-length HMGB1(Met1-Glu157) by the protein consisting only of the N-terminal portion HMGB1(Met1-Tyr109) and by the individual HMG-box DNA binding domain HMGB1(Gly35-Tyr109) (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the HMG-box domain is sufficient to mediate the interaction with the Dof domain of Dof2. The interaction between the HMG-box domain and ΔDof2 was further analyzed by chemical protein cross-linking. ΔDof2 was mixed in equimolar amounts with the individual HMG-box domain of HMGB1 and treated for various times with glutaraldehyde, before the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Due to the covalent cross-linking, the amount of the original protein bands was reduced and a new protein band appeared, which corresponds to the ΔDof2·HMGB1(Gly35-Tyr109) complex (Fig. 1C). Immunoblot analyses of cross-linked complexes with antisera against HMGB and Dof confirm the presence of both proteins in the complex band. 2N. M. Krohn and K. D. Grasser, unpublished results. Comparison of the migration position of the ΔDof2·HMGB1(Gly35-Tyr109) complex with that of marker proteins suggests that the two proteins most likely form a 1:1 complex. Treatment of either HMGB1(Gly35-Tyr109) or ΔDof2 individually with glutaraldehyde did not result in any cross-linked products (Fig. 1C). To examine whether the HMG-box DNA binding domain is sufficient for stimulating the binding of ΔDof2 to its DNA recognition sequence, EMSAs were performed. In pilot shift experiments, the concentration of ΔDof2 (10 nm) was determined that resulted only in a small amount of protein-DNA complex (of low electrophoretic mobility) with the 32P-labeled Dof site oligonucleotide (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 8), while HMGB proteins form only at higher concentrations a complex with the oligonucleotide that has a higher mobility than the ΔDof2 complex (lane 2). To the fixed amount of ΔDof2, increasing concentrations of HMGB1 and of the individual HMG-box domain of HMGB1 were added and analyzed by EMSA (Fig. 2A). Addition of the HMGB1 proteins to the ΔDof2 protein resulted in an enhanced formation of the ΔDof2·DNA complex (without altering the electrophoretic mobility of the complex relative to the complex formed in the absence of HMGB1), demonstrating that HMGB1 facilitates the binding of ΔDof2 to its target sequence. The individual HMG-box DNA binding domain is ∼2-fold more efficient than full-length HMGB1 (and HMGB1(Met1-Tyr109)) in stimulating the DNA binding of ΔDof2 (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the stimulatory effect appears to depend not directly on the DNA binding affinity of the HMGB1 proteins, since the relative affinity of the HMGB1 derivatives for DNA is HMGB1(Met1-Tyr109) > HMGB1 ≈ HMGB1(Gly35-Tyr109) (50Ritt C. Grimm R. Fernández S. Alonso J.C. Grasser K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2673-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas the relative stimulation of Dof2 DNA-binding is HMGB1(Gly35-Tyr109) > HMGB1(Met1-Tyr109) > HMGB1. Using the GST binding assay with GST-ΔDof2, we have analyzed whether ΔDof2 can interact with maize HMGB proteins other than HMGB1. Therefore, HMGB1, HMGB2/3, HMGB4, and HMGB5 were examined for their ability to bind GST-ΔDof2. All five maize HMGB proteins can interact with GST-ΔDof2 as they are retained on the matrix by GST-ΔDof2 bound to glutathione-Sepharose, but not by GST without ΔDof2 fusion (Fig. 3A). The interaction of ΔDof2 with HMGB1 and HMGB5 was further examined by chemical protein cross-linking experiments. Equimolar mixtures of ΔDof2 and HMGB1 or HMGB5 proteins were treated with glutaraldehyde for various times before the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.3B). Both HMGB1 and HMGB5 formed a specific, cross-linked complex with ΔDof2, whereas no cross-linked products were obtained, when the proteins were individually treated with glutaraldehyde. Quantification of the bands corresponding to the cross-linked complex revealed that compared with HMGB1, HMGB5 was ∼3-fold more readily cross-linked to ΔDof2 (as also evident from more intense bands of the cross-linked complex with HMGB5), suggesting that ΔDof2 has a higher affinity for HMGB5. The migration of the cross-linked complexes relative to ΔDof2 reflects the difference in size between HMGB1 (∼17 kDa) and HMGB5 (∼13 kDa) (compare top and bottom panels of Fig. 3B). We then compared the influence of the various HMGB proteins on the binding of ΔDof2 to its DNA recognition sequence using EMSAs. Increasing concentrations of the HMGB proteins were incubated with a fixed amount of ΔDof2, before the 32P-labeled Dof site oligonucleotide was added. Quantification of the complex formation from EMSA gels revealed that the various HMGB proteins have very different abilities to facilitate the binding of ΔDof2 to its target sequence (Fig. 4A). HMGB5 was clearly most efficient in stimulating ΔDof2 DNA binding (>30-fold at a concentration of 400 nm), whereas HMGB1 to HMGB4 were significantly less effective (5–10-fold stimulation at 400 nm). We then changed the order of addition of the components in the EMSA experiment to examine, whether the interaction of ΔDof2 and HMGB proteins prior to DNA binding is of importance for the stimulatory effect. Therefore, a fixed amount ΔDof2 and the DNA were incubated before the HMGB proteins were added in various concentrations. Quantification of the complex formation from EMSA gels revealed that the stimulatory effect on ΔDof2 DNA binding was diminished in these experiments (Fig.4B), when the preincubation of ΔDof2 and HMGB proteins was omitted. The observed reduction of the stimulatory effect was most striking with HMGB5, which still displayed the largest effect on ΔDof2 DNA binding, however, only ∼20% compared with the experiment including a preincubation of ΔDof2 and HMGB5 (cf. Fig. 4A). The marked positive effect of the preincubation of the two proteins on the DNA binding of ΔDof2 suggests that the protein/protein interaction between ΔDof2 and the HMGB proteins (which is mediated by the DNA binding domains of both proteins) is essential for maximal HMGB-mediated stimulation of the DNA target site binding by ΔDof2. Analysis of the time course of the binding of ΔDof2 and HMGB to the DNA by EMSAs revealed that the preincubation results in more rapid assembly of the protein-DNA complex.2 As the HMGB-stimulated ΔDof2 protein-DNA complex formed on the Dof site oligonucleotide co-migrates with the ΔDof2 protein complex formed in the absence of HMGB proteins (Fig. 2A), the question arises whether the HMGB protein is present in the final protein-DNA complex. To investigate this, the analytical binding reaction of preincubated ΔDof2 and HMGB5 to the Dof site oligonucleotide used in EMSAs was scaled up (in quantities as described for the cross-linking experiment) and separated by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The DNA was detected in the EMSA gel by SYBR Gold staining before the identified band corresponding to the protein-DNA complex was cut from the gel, and the proteins contained in the gel slice were examined by SDS-PAGE (Fig.5A). By comparison with input proteins of the binding reaction, it was evident that the protein-DNA complex contained both ΔDof2 and HMGB5. The protein-DNA complex was further analyzed by chemical cross-linking experiments, using conditions comparable with those of the preparative EMSA experiment. To preincubated ΔDof2 and HMGB5 proteins, either no DNA, the Dof site oligonucleotide, or an unrelated oligonucleotide (without Dof binding site) was added. The samples were reacted with glutaraldehyde and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5B). As seen in the previous experiments, ΔDof2 and HMGB5 were cross-linked in the absence of DNA. Similarly, both proteins were cross-linked in the presence of the control oligonucleotide, but no cross-linked complex could be detected in the presence of the Dof site oligonucleotide. To examine whether ΔDof2 and HMGB5 are in proximity to each other without being in direct contact, when bound to the Dof site oligonucleotide, the experiment described in the legend to Fig. 5B was repeated using DSS as cross-linking reagent. In contrast to glutaraldehyde (5-Å spacer arm), DSS has a spacer length of 11.4 Å and therefore can also covalently link proteins that are more distant from each other than can be linked by glutaraldehyde. In this experiment, ΔDof2 and HMGB5 were cross-linked by DSS in the absence of DNA and in the presence of both types of DNA (Fig.5C). Taken together these results indicate that Dof2 and HMGB5 form a ternary complex on the Dof site oligonucleotide (Fig.5, A and C). When the proteins are bound to the Dof site oligonucleotide, Dof2 and HMGB5 appear to be no longer in direct contact, as they still can be cross-linked by DSS (Fig.5C) but not by glutaraldehyd (Fig. 5B). It was recently found that the maize HMGB1 and HMGB2/3, but not the HMGB4 and HMGB5 proteins, are phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2 in vitro and in vivo within their acidic C-terminal domains (34Stemmer C. Schwander A. Bauw G. Fojan P. Grasser K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1092-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We wanted to examine whether the phosphorylation influences the interaction of HMGB1 and ΔDof2. Therefore, HMGB1 was phosphorylated in vitro using recombinant maize CK2 (34Stemmer C. Schwander A. Bauw G. Fojan P. Grasser K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1092-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The interaction of CK2-phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated HMGB1 with GST-ΔDof2 was analyzed by the GST binding assay. Non-phosphorylated HMGB1, but not the CK2-phosphorylated HMGB1, was specifically retained on the glutathione affinity matrix by the GST-ΔDof2 protein (Fig.6A). Analysis of the ΔDof2-HMGB1 interaction by the more sensitive chemical cross-linking approach using glutaraldehyde (Fig. 6B) demonstrated that the interaction is markedly reduced,"

We present here a comparative analysis for binding of the MV receptors CD46 and SLAM to the measles virus hemagglutinin protein (MVH, Edmonston strain). Soluble monomeric and dimeric MVH variants were prepared in mammalian cells and their conformation assessed using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. The two receptor molecules specifically bound to the MVH protein with distinct binding modes. The association rate (ka) for SLAM binding to MVH was very low (∼3000 m−1s−1), about 20 times lower that the ka determined for CD46 binding. However, SLAM bound tighter to the virus protein than CD46, as revealed by a 5-fold lower dissociation rate (kd, ∼1.5 × 10−3 s−1). These data suggest that the SLAM receptor binds to a less accessible and more hydrophobic surface on MVH than the CD46 receptor, as illustrated in a binding model. Despite the differences in kinetics, receptor competition binding experiments revealed that they recognize overlapping sites in MVH. Indeed, a panel of anti-MVH monoclonal antibodies equally inhibited binding of both receptor molecules. The similar immune reactivity of the two receptor binding sites suggests that the shift in receptor usage by MV may not be driven by immune responses.

Even though there is specificity in virus-receptor recognition, flexibility in receptor usage has been reported for several enveloped and non-enveloped viruses (1Baranowski E. Ruiz-Jarabo C.M. Domingo E. Science. 2001; 292: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Virus strains differing in the cellular receptor used for attachment and entry appear during the course of the infection. A well documented example is provided by measles virus (MV)1 (2Naniche D.

MV, a highly contagious agent infecting millions of individuals worldwide, is one of the most serious diseases in children in developing countries, causing more than 1 million deaths annually (10Clements C.J. Cutts F.T. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 191: 13-133PubMed Google Scholar). The virus belongs to the Morbillivirus genus of the Paramyxovirus family (11Griffin D.E. Bellini W.J. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Melnick J.L. Chanock R.M. Roizman B. Monath T.P. Virology 1. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1996: 1267-1312Google Scholar). The virus particle contains a negative strand RNA genome packed in a ribonucleoprotein structure surrounded by an envelope or lipid bilayer with two transmembrane glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin (MVH) and the fusion protein (MVF). MVH is a type II membrane protein that forms disulfide-linked homodimers on the surface of the virus. The extracellular region of the protein has been predicted to fold into a C-terminal β-propeller domain connected by a protein stalk to the membrane-spanning domain, as described for related proteins of members of the Paramyxovirus family (12Langedijk J.P.M. Daus F.J. van Oirschot J.T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6155-6167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Crennell S. Takimoto T. Portner A. Taylor G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). MVF is a type I membrane protein formed by two disulfide-linked polypeptides (F1 and F2) in its mature conformation (11Griffin D.E. Bellini W.J. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Melnick J.L. Chanock R.M. Roizman B. Monath T.P. Virology 1. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1996: 1267-1312Google Scholar). It is expected to form tetramers at the virus membrane and associate with the MVH dimers. The precise nature of these interactions and the processes linking receptor binding to membrane fusion are currently unknown. Characterized strains or isolates of MV differ in their cellular tropism (4Lecouturier V. Fayolle J. Caballero M. Carabana J. Celma M. Fernandez-Munoz R. Wild T.F. Buckland R. J.

Virol. 1998; 72: 2905-2916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These differences appear to be related to differences in cellular receptor recognition for cell entry. The ubiquitously expressed CD46 was first characterized as the receptor for the vaccine or Edmonston strain of MV (2Naniche D. Varior-Krishman G. Cervoni F. Wild T.F. Rossi B. Rabourdin-Combe C. Gerlier D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6025-6032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Dorig R.E. Marcil A. Chopra A. Richardson C.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 295-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). The CD46 ectodomain contains four short consensus repeats domains (SCR1–SCR4), and the two N-terminal repeats bind to MV. The structure of the MV binding fragment of CD46 revealed a large binding surface with a central protruding loop bearing a critical virus binding residue (14Casasnovas J.M. Larvie M. Stehle T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2911-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). MV strains differ in their affinity for CD46 (8Manchester M. Eto D.S. Valsamakis A. Liton P.B. Fernández-Muñoz R. Rota P.A. Bellini W.J. Forthal D.N. Oldstone M.B.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3967-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although virus variants grown in fibroblast-like cells bind well to CD46 on the cell surface, primary isolates or viruses grown in lymphoid cells have low affinity or undetectable binding to this receptor. These differences correlate with a single Asn-to-Tyr mutation in the MVH glycoprotein (7Hsu E.C. Sarangi F. Iorio C. Sidhu M.S. Udem S.A. Dillehay D.L., Xu, W. Rota P.A. Bellini W.J. Richardson C.D.

Virol. 2000; 74: 3967-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recently, the lymphocyte-specific receptor molecule SLAM was identified as a receptor for MV (9Tatsuo H. Ono N. Tanaka K. Yanagi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 893-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Primary isolates, lymphotropic, and laboratory-adapted virus variants all bound to SLAM on the cell surface with comparable affinity (9Tatsuo H. Ono N. Tanaka K. Yanagi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 893-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 15Hsu E.C. Iorio C. Sarangi F. Khine A.A. Richardson C.D. Virology. 2001; 279: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These data suggest that SLAM could be the primary receptor during measles virus infections and that new virus species with increased affinity for the ubiquitous CD46 receptor could arise during the course of the infection, facilitating spreading of the virus throughout the body. Moreover, primary infection of lymphocytes by the virus may explain the immune suppression associated with some MV infections (9Tatsuo H. Ono N. Tanaka K. Yanagi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 893-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The determinants of the flexibility in receptor usage by MV or any other virus are currently unknown. Moreover, no comparative analysis on binding of several monomeric receptors to a single virus has yet been reported, including the binding of CD46 and SLAM to MVH. There are several reports on interactions of viruses with individual receptors, which have provided information about the nature of virus-receptor recognition (16Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. J.

The binding kinetics for virus-receptor interactions are highly variable, reflecting differences among the conformation of the receptor binding sites in viruses as well as in the residue composition of the virus-receptor binding interfaces. We have developed an experimental approach for the analysis of monomeric CD46 and SLAM receptors binding to soluble MVH (Edmonston) using surface plasmon resonance. The Edmonston variant of MV was chosen because of its ability to bind to both receptor molecules. Our data show that CD46 and SLAM bind to overlapping sites on the MVH protein with significantly higher kinetic rates for CD46 than SLAM. A model for binding of the virus protein to the receptors is presented. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies inhibited the binding of both receptors to MVH very efficiently. The monoclonal antibody recognizing the HA epitope (anti-HA) present in the recombinants MVH proteins (see below) is from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, the SLAM antibody, IPO3, from PharMingen, and the IgG1-horseradish peroxidase rabbit anti-human antibody from Dako. Mouse monoclonal antibodies binding to MVH (I-12, I-29, I-41, I-44, 16-CD11, and 16-DE6) were prepared from hybridomas (21Sheshberadaran H. Norrby E. Virology. 1986; 152: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and anti-MVH-specific MV4, MV12, and MT14 were human recombinant neutralizing Fabs derived by the phage display method (22de Carvalho Nicacio C. Williamson R.A. Parren P.W.H.I. Lundkvist Å. Burton D.R. Björling E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recombinant MVH (Edmonston strain) cDNAs were cloned in-frame with the murine Ig κ-chain leader sequence and a hemagglutinin A epitope (HA epitope) present in the vector pDisplay (Invitrogen). The cDNAs starting at N-terminal residues 61, 135, 149, 156, 179, 193, and 288, respectively, for variants 1–7 (Fig.1A) and with a translation stop codon at position 617 were generated by PCR from pTM-H/MV (23Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Moss B. Stern L. Rozenblatt S. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3341-3349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using PfuI polymerase (Stratagene). They were cloned into the unique SacII and SalI sites of pDisplay (Invitrogen). 293T cells were transiently transfected with the constructs in pDisplay for immunoprecipitations (see below). MVH protein variants 3 and 4 were also expressed in CHO Lec 3.2.8.1 (CHO-Lec) cells using the glutamine synthetase system as described previously (16Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13216-13224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Soluble MVH was immunopurified from cell culture supernatants using a 16-CD11-Sepharose column. The protein was eluted from the antibody column using triethanolamine-saline buffer (pH 11.0) and was quickly equilibrated with 1 m Tris-saline buffer (pH 6.0). Proteins were further purified using a size exclusion column Sephadex 75 (AmershamBiosciences) in Hepes buffer-saline (HBS), pH 7.5. Expression and purification of soluble CD46 containing SCR1 and SCR2 (CD46/SCR1–2) from CHO-Lec cells has been described previously (14Casasnovas J.M. Larvie M. Stehle T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2911-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A soluble CD46 variant containing all four SCR and ending at residue 285 of the precursor CD46 polypeptide (CD46/SCR1–4) was expressed in CHO-Lec cells as described for CD46/SCR1–2. The protein was immunopurified from cell culture supernatants with the anti-CD46 monoclonal antibody 122-2, which recognizes the SCR1–2 portion (not shown). A CD46 fragment comprising domains SCR3 and SCR4 (CD46/SCR3–4) was expressed in Pichia pastoris using the expression vector pPICZAα (Invitrogen). The CD46/SCR3–4 protein contains residues 159–285 of the precursor CD46 polypeptide followed by six His residues at its C-terminal end. Yeast clones secreting the protein to the supernatant were selected with Zeocine as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Protein was purified from yeast supernatants by chelate affinity chromatography (AmershamBiosciences). All of the proteins were subjected to size exclusion chromatography as a final purification step for the removal of high molecular weight aggregates. Purity was checked by PAGE and the concentration calculated from the protein extinction coefficient as determined from the amino acid composition. A full-length SLAM cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR from total RNA isolated from JY cells using specific primers and subcloned into the unique EcoRI and NotI sites of pBSKS (Stratagene). The sequence of the clone was identical to the reported sequence of SLAM (24Cocks B.G. Chang C.J. Carballido J.M. Yssei H. de Vries J.E. Aversa G. Nature. 1995; 376: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), with the only change being the Phe residue in position 11 to Leu in the secretory signal sequence. The sequence coding for the leader sequence and the extracellular region of SLAM was amplified and cloned upstream from a cassette coding for the Fc region of human IgG1 in the expression vector pEF-BOS (25Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). A thrombin cleavage sequence was introduced at the 3′-end of the SLAM cDNA. The SLAM-Fc fusion protein was prepared from transiently transfected 293T cells. Protein secretion to the cell supernatant was monitored by a sandwich ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with antibodies against SLAM (IPO-3) and human IgG1-Fc (Dako). The fusion protein was purified by protein A affinity chromatography, and the SLAM fragment was released from the Fc by thrombin treatment at 30 °C. Final purification of the soluble SLAM included a size exclusion chromatogram. 293T cells (2.5 × 106 cells) were plated in 10-mm-diameter tissue culture plates and transiently transfected with 15 μg of DNA/plate using the calcium phosphate method. Cells were labeled 1 day post-transfection with 35S-Met (75 μCi/ml) and 35S-Cys (25 μCi/ml) in minimum essential medium and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. Supernatants were collected, clarified by centrifugation, and divided into identical aliquots for immunoprecipitation with purified monoclonal antibodies anti-HA or anti-MVH at 2 μg/ml concentration and protein A-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Experiments were carried out with plastic-coated MVH variant 4 (MVH4). A 96-well plate (Nunc) was coated with 1 μm MVH4 protein in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C, and blocked with 200 μl of 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C. Purified CD46/SCR1–4, CD46/SCR1–2, and CD46/SCR3–4 were added to cell supernatants having SLAM-Fc to reach final concentrations of 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 μm. Mixtures were added to triplicate wells with plastic-coated MVH and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Binding of the fusion protein was monitored using a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-human IgG1-Fc polyclonal antibody (Dako). Inhibition (%) of SLAM-Fc binding to MVH was determined by the ratio between the A490 from wells having and lacking CD46 proteins. Surface plasmon resonance was applied to monitor protein-protein interactions using a BIAcore 2000 instrument and CM5 sensor chips. HEPES buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) was used as running buffer. First, the anti-HA antibody was covalently immobilized in the dextran surface of the chip via primary amino groups using the amine coupling kit (BIAcore). Anti-HA (30 ng/ml) was injected in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and about 13,000 resonance units were usually immobilized. For receptor binding experiments, MVH variant 3 or 4 was first injected through the surface with anti-HA antibody at 3 μl/min followed by the injection of the soluble receptors molecules at 10–20 μl/min. Proteins were released from the antibody for surface regeneration by a pulse of 50 mmcitric acid, pH 3.0. Successive cycles of binding and regeneration were usually performed on the same monoclonal antibody surface with no apparent change in its activity. Binding kinetics were determined from analysis of the sensorgrams with the BIA Evaluation 3.0 program in two different ways. First, a simple Langmuir fitting model was applied to sensorgrams corrected by drifting of the base line from the release of antibody-captured MVH during receptor injection. The correction was done by subtraction of a control sensorgram recorded with buffer instead of receptor. Kinetics were also analyzed by applying the drifting base-line model included in the BIA Evaluation 3.0 software. In this case a base line drifting rate calculated from the dissociation of MVH from the monoclonal antibody was applied to the fitting model. Both methods gave similar kinetic rates. Affinity dissociation constants were determined either from the kinetic rates (kd/ka) or from the amount of receptor bound at steady-state conditions by Scatchard plots. The amount of bound receptor was determined 20 s after the end of the injection and corrected by the base-line drifting and the unspecific binding of the receptor to surfaces lacking MVH. Kinetic rates determined at four different temperatures were used to calculate the activation energy of the association and dissociation reactions as described (16Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13216-13224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Enthalpy (ΔH°) was determined from the differences between activation energy for association and dissociation reactions. The MVH glycoprotein has the transmembrane domain at its N terminus, so that the expression of soluble MVH variants required replacement of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains by the murine Ig κ-chain leader sequence (Fig. 1A). Several constructs having different fragments of the extracellular region of the protein were prepared using the Cys residues as reference. Protein expression was analyzed by transient expression in 293T cells, radiolabeling, and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B). All variants except one that lacked Cys287 were secreted to the cell supernatant and presented an electrophoretic mobility under reducing conditions consistent with their size. The size of variants 1–3 was about two times higher under nonreducing than under reducing conditions, showing that they formed disulfide-linked dimers. MVH4 appeared monomeric, showing that Cys residue 154 was involved in the intermolecular association of the longest variants. MVH6 appeared partially as a disulfide-linked dimer, most likely formed by an intermolecular disulfide bond involving the Cys residue paired with the deleted Cys188. The conformation of the MVH soluble variants was assessed using a panel of monoclonal antibodies recognizing four different antigenic sites previously defined in the MVH protein (21Sheshberadaran H. Norrby E. Virology. 1986; 152: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies representing all four antigenic sites immunoprecipitated the six expressed soluble variants of the Edmonston strain of MV (Fig.2). Differences in the amount of protein among the different variants could be related to differences in protein expression. Soluble protein fragments of CD46 having the two N-terminal short consensus repeats (CD46/SCR1–2) or the four SCR of the protein (CD46/SCR1–4) were prepared in CHO-Lec cells and presented a low glycosylation-related heterogeneity (Fig.3A, inset). A BIAcore 2000 instrument was used to monitor CD46 binding to soluble MVH. The MVH protein carrying a HA epitope at the N terminus (Fig. 1) were captured on surfaces having covalently immobilized anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3A). CD46 was subsequently injected through surfaces having or lacking captured MVH protein, and the increase in the base line after CD46 injection (buffer 2, Fig. 3A) was recorded specifically in the surfaces having MVH protein. Binding was specific for soluble CD46 receptors with SCR1–2 and SCR1–4 (Fig.3B). About two times higher binding (shown in resonance units (RU)) for CD46/SCR1–4 than CD46/SCR1–2 was monitored at the end of the receptor injection. This was consistent with the difference in size between the two proteins, which suggested similar binding affinities. The CD46/SCR3–4 protein lacking the MV binding site did not bind to the sensor chip surface with captured MVH (Fig.3B). The complete extracellular region of the SLAM receptor was also expressed in mammalian cells and purified for analysis of binding to MVH in BIAcore (Fig. 4). The size of the soluble receptor was as expected (Fig. 4, inset), and it bound to the monoclonal antibody IPO-3 after final purification. SLAM bound specifically to BIAcore surfaces having captured MVH protein (Fig. 4). However the binding sensorgrams were strikingly different from those recorded during the injection of CD46 (Fig.5).FIG. 5Binding dependence on receptor concentration. Overlay plots of sensorgrams recording response shown in resonance units (RU) during and after injection of different concentrations of CD46/SCR1–4 (A) and SLAM (B) through surfaces with captured MVH4. 40 μl of the protein samples were injected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at 25 °C. Corrected binding curves by base-line drifting and unspecific receptor binding to a control surface are presented. Five different cycles of receptor association and dissociation are shown. The protein concentration is indicated for each cycle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The determination of the kinetics for receptor binding to MVH required recording several cycles of receptor association and dissociation using different receptor concentrations (Fig. 5). Binding of the receptor to the surface with immobilized MVH increased with the receptor concentration. About a 10-fold higher concentration of SLAM receptor than CD46 was required to have similar binding. However, the CD46 protein dissociated faster from MVH than SLAM. Sensorgrams recorded for CD46 plateau, indicating higher binding kinetic rates for CD46 than for SLAM. Kinetic and affinity constants were first determined from the recorded binding sensorgrams at 25 °C (Table I). The affinities for CD46 binding to dimeric (MVH3) or monomeric (MVH4) proteins determined from either the kinetic constants (KD) or the MVH-bound receptor at steady-state conditions (KD*) were not significantly different. CD46 binding affinity was similar to that reported (120 nm) for monomeric receptor binding to membrane bound MVH (26Christiansen D. Devaux P. Reveil B. Evlashev A. Horvat B. Lamy J. Rabourdin-Combe C. Cohen J.H.M. Gerlier D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The kinetic association constants (ka) for binding of both CD46 and SLAM to the MVH3 variant were slightly higher, although the kd rates were almost identical. Kinetic rates did not change with the flow (10–80 μl/min) or amount of captured MVH (not shown), indicating an absence of mass transfer or rebinding during receptor association and dissociation phases.Table IAffinity and kinetic rate constants for receptor binding to MVHInteractionka × 10−3kd × 103KDK*DM−1s−1s−1nmnmCD46-MVH372 (30)7.3 (2.5)100 (20)126 (10)CD46-MVH458 (13)7.5 (0.8)130 (32)227 (60)SLAM-MVH35 (0.8)1.4 (0.2)265 (50)NDSLAM-MVH42 (0.4)1.7 (0.5)770 (150)ND Open table in a new tab The differences between the kinetics for binding of CD46 and SLAM to both MVH proteins were highly significant. Association and dissociation kinetic rates were about 20 and 5 times higher, respectively, for CD46 binding as compared with SLAM, resulting in a higher affinity (lowerKD) for the CD46 receptor. Dissociation affinity constants increased with the temperatures for binding of both receptors to MVH, showing a release of heat upon receptor binding to the MVH protein (Table II).Table IIEffect of the temperature on binding of CD46 and SLAM to MVHInteractionKD 15°KD20°KD 25°KD30°ΔH°nmnmnmnmkcal/molCD46-MVH495 (10)140 (20)180 (20)250 (40)−11SLAM-MVH4180 (140)460 (140)690 (110)800 (60)−17 Open table in a new tab A receptor binding competition experiment was carried out with plastic-coated MVH protein, monomeric soluble CD46 molecules, and a dimeric SLAM-Fc protein (Fig. 6A). The IgG1-Fc region fused to the SLAM receptor facilitated detection of the protein bound to MVH (see “Materials and Methods”). Increasing concentrations of soluble CD46 variants were added together with a SLAM-Fc protein to wells with immobilized MVH protein, and progressively higher inhibition of SLAM binding to MVH was observed with CD46/SCR1–4 and CD46/SCR1–2 (Fig. 6A). The smaller CD46 variant with only 2 repeats gave an inhibitory effect similar to that of the longer variant. These results indicated overlapping binding sites for the two receptors on the viral protein. No binding inhibition was observed with CD46/SCR3–4, a protein that does not bind to MVH (see Fig. 3B). Further analysis of the receptor binding epitopes on MVH was carried out in BIAcore using anti-MVH neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Fig.6B). The antibodies used are clustered in four antigenic sites: I (I-12 and I-29), II (16-CD11), III (I-41, 16-DE6, MV12, and MT14), and IV (I-44) (21Sheshberadaran H. Norrby E. Virology. 1986; 152: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22de Carvalho Nicacio C. Williamson R.A. Parren P.W.H.I. Lundkvist Å. Burton D.R. Björling E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). MV4 has not been clustered yet. The receptor-binding inhibitory properties of those antibodies were determined in BIAcore using surfaces with varying amounts of captured MVH (Fig. 6B). Purified antibody and Fab molecules were injected at saturating concentrations through the MVH surfaces prior to the injection of the receptor proteins. Antibodies from antigenic sites I (I-29), II, and III abolished binding of both receptors to MVH. I-12 and I-44 were partially inhibitory. All antibodies gave similar inhibition of binding of both receptor molecules to MVH. These data confirm that the binding sites of the CD46 and SLAM receptors are overlapping and show that neutralizing antibodies prevent receptor binding. We have analyzed virus-receptor interactions with soluble MVH proteins and the two receptor molecules used by MV for entry into host cells. The soluble variants used here were recognized by monoclonal antibodies directed to four MVH antigenic sites (21Sheshberadaran H. Norrby E. Virology. 1986; 152: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and therefore it is presumed that they must have the same conformation as the protein present in the virus envelope. Our data revealed that the CD46 and SLAM receptors bind to overlapping but distinct interacting surfaces in MVH, as shown by the large differences in their binding kinetics. Binding kinetics provide information on the nature of protein-protein interactions. The rate of association is dependent on the rate of diffusion and can be modulated by electrostatic forces (27Selzer T. Albeck S. Schreiber G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the rate of dissociation can be directly correlated with the strength of the binding interaction. High kinetic rates arise from electrostatic protein-protein interactions, whereas relatively hydrophobic binding surfaces result in lower rates (28Davis S.J. Davies E.A. Tucknott M.G. Jones E.Y. van der Merwe P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5490-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The kinetic rates determined for the binding of the SLAM receptor to the MVH protein (Table I) are low and surprisingly similar to the binding of the ICAM-1 receptor to human rhinovirus (16Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13216-13224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, the low rate of association presented by SLAM suggests a hydrophobic virus-receptor binding interface and, as reported for major group rhinoviruses (29Kolatkar P.R. Bella J. Olson N.H. Bator C.M. Baker T.S. Rossmann M.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6249-6259Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), binding of the receptor molecule to a relatively inaccessible surface. By contrast, association of CD46 to MVH was about 20 times faster, indicating that the binding surface for this receptor molecule is more accessible and therefore more hydrophilic. Indeed, the higher dissociation rate for CD46 also suggests a weaker and more electrostatic interaction than that for SLAM. The receptor binding region of the MVH protein is expected to have a β-propeller fold (12Langedijk J.P.M. Daus F.J. van Oirschot J.T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6155-6167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as shown for the related hemagglutinin-neuraminidase of Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) (13Crennell S. Takimoto T. Portner A. Taylor G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The low kinetic association rate of the SLAM molecule suggests binding of the receptor molecule to the relatively inaccessible inner cavity of the β-propeller, where sialic acid binds to the NDV neuraminidase. The N-terminal domain of SLAM is the MV-binding domain (30Ono N. Hironobu T. Tanaka K. Minagawa H. Yanagi Y. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, as shown for binding of ICAM-1 to rhinoviruses (29Kolatkar P.R. Bella J. Olson N.H. Bator C.M. Baker T.S. Rossmann M.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6249-6259Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we predicted that the loops in the tip of the MV-binding domain of SLAM would penetrate into the cavity of the propeller, as illustrated in Fig.7. It is however unlikely that the large measles virus surface of the CD46 receptor could penetrate extensively into the propeller cavity (14Casasnovas J.M. Larvie M. Stehle T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2911-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Tyr481residue critical for CD46 binding is modeled outside of the cavity, on the side of the MVH propeller domain (Fig. 7). We expected the Tyr481 would contact with the MV binding residue Pro39 on the protruding D′D-loop located in the first repeat of CD46 (14Casasnovas J.M. Larvie M. Stehle T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2911-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The second repeat of CD46 could overlap with the SLAM binding surface on the top of the propeller. The differences between the MVH binding surfaces of the CD46 and SLAM receptors proposed here are consistent with the differences in the binding kinetic rates determined. The oligomerization state of the different MVH length variants shows that residue Cys154 is involved in formation of soluble disulfide-linked homodimers as reported for the membrane-bound hemagglutinin (31Sato T.A. Enami M. Kohama T. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 513-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Plemper R.K. Hammond A.L. Cattaneo R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6485-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Receptors bound to monomeric and dimeric MVH variants with similar affinities and almost identicalkd, indicating that the virus-receptor binding surface is located in a single virus protein and that the interaction is equimolar. The higher ka determined with the dimeric MVH molecule is not very significant, but it could reflect a more accessible binding site in the dimer. Binding of both receptor molecules to MVH was exothermic, as described for the binding of CD4 to the HIV gp120 protein (19Myszka D.G. Sweet R.W. Hensley P. Brigham-Burke M. Kwong P.D. Hendrickson W.A. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Doyle M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9026-9031Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). We would expect that the energy released by binding of the receptor molecule to one of the spike proteins could trigger the molecular events that follow receptor binding and lead to fusion. Indeed, HIV and MV entry do not require acidification and must therefore be mediated actively by receptor binding. Further studies on receptor binding to the complete spike protein complex are needed to understand the link between receptor binding and fusion events in MV. The overlapping nature of the CD46 and SLAM receptor binding sites was demonstrated by a receptor binding competition experiment and by antibody blocking of receptor binding to MVH (Fig. 6). Antibodies belonging to antigenic sites I (I-29), II, and III completely inhibited receptor binding to MVH, suggesting that these sites are in the vicinity of the receptor binding site and on the top of the β-propeller domain (Fig. 7). Antigenic site IV must be more distant because the antibody I-44 had lower inhibitory activity. These data show that the receptor binding surface in MVH is a major target for antibody responses neutralizing virus infectivity (21Sheshberadaran H. Norrby E. Virology. 1986; 152: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22de Carvalho Nicacio C. Williamson R.A. Parren P.W.H.I. Lundkvist Å. Burton D.R. Björling E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The similarities in blocking receptor binding to MVH among the different monoclonal antibody tested suggest that the shift in receptor usage by MV may not necessarily be driven by specific immune responses. A major force behind it may be the marked differences in tissue distribution between the SLAM and CD46 receptors. Initial measles infection may develop in lymphoid cells expressing the SLAM receptor. Populations of virus with increased affinity for the CD46 receptor may appear during the course of the infection and move from lymphoid cells into other cell types in immunosuppressed individuals. The use of the CD46 receptor leads to MV pathogenesis in animal models (33Oldstone M.B.A. Lewicki H. Thomas D. Tishon A. Dales S. Patterson J. Manchester M. Homann D. Naniche D. Holz A. Cell. 1999; 98: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and may be needed for the spread of the infection to different tissues, including the central nervous system.

https://openalex.org/W1993798779,"The amino-terminal laminin G-like domain of human sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) contains a single high affinity steroid-binding site. Crystal structures of this domain in complex with several different steroid ligands have revealed that estradiol occupies the SHBG steroid-binding site in an opposite orientation when compared with 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone or C19 androgen metabolites (5 alpha-androstan-3 beta,17 beta-diol and 5 alpha-androstan-3 beta,17 alpha-diol) or the synthetic progestin levonorgestrel. Substitution of specific residues within the SHBG steroid-binding site confirmed that Ser(42) plays a key role in determining high affinity interactions by hydrogen bonding to functional groups at C3 of the androstanediols and levonorgestrel and the hydroxyl at C17 of estradiol. Among residues participating in the hydrogen bond network with hydroxy groups at C17 of C19 steroids or C3 of estradiol, Asp(65) appears to be the most important. The different binding mode of estradiol is associated with a difference in the position/orientation of residues (Leu(131) and Lys(134)) in the loop segment (Leu(131)-His(136)) that covers the steroid-binding site as well as others (Leu(171)-Lys(173) and Trp(84)) on the surface of human SHBG and may provide a basis for ligand-dependent interactions between SHBG and other macromolecules. These new crystal structures have also enabled us to construct a simple space-filling model that can be used to predict the characteristics of novel SHBG ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2033920047,"NF-κB is an important transcription factor that has a role in a variety of responses such as inflammation, oncogenesis, apoptosis, and viral replication. Oxidative stress is well known to induce the activation of NF-κB. Cells can be exposed to either endogenously produced oxidants or oxidants produced by surrounding cells. In addition, ischemia reperfusion and certain cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy are thought to result in oxygen radical production. Because of the important role that NF-κB has in multiple responses, it is critical to determine the mechanisms by which oxidative stress induces NF-κB activity. We report that the calmodulin antagonist W-7 and the calcium/calmodulin-dependent (CaM) kinase inhibitors KN-93 and K252a, can block oxidative stress-induced IκB phosphorylation in Jurkat T lymphocytes. Furthermore, KN-93 but not KN-92 can block hydrogen peroxide-induced Akt and IKK phosphorylation. In addition, we found that expression of a kinase-dead CaM-KIV construct in two cell lines inhibits IκB phosphorylation or degradation and that expression of CaM-KIV augments hydrogen peroxide-induced IκB phosphorylation and degradation. Although the CaM kinases appear to be required for this response, increases in intracellular calcium do not appear to be required. These results identify the CaM kinases as potential targets that can be used to minimize NF-κB activation in response to oxidative stress.

The Rel family is composed of homologous proteins (c-Rel, Rel-b, p50, p52, and p65) that contain a region known as the Rel homology domain. The classic, or most studied, form of the NF-κB transcription factor is a heterodimer composed of p65 and p50 Rel family members (1May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 2Baeuerle P. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). NF-κB is in an inactive state when bound to IκB (inhibitor of κB). NF-κB bound to IκB is sequestered in the cytoplasm of the cell were it cannot act as a transcriptional regulator (3Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). This is because the binding of IκB to NF-κB masks the nuclear localization region on NF-κB (4Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheinman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin A.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1899-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IκB targets it for ubiquitination and proteolysis (5Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar, 6Karin M. Delhase M.

Following IκB degradation, the nuclear localization region of NF-κB is revealed and it translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor (2Baeuerle P. Henkel T. Annu. Rev.

One complex that is known to phosphorylate IκB is IκB kinase (IKK)1 (6Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Akt, MEKK (mitogen-activated or extracellular-regulated kinase kinase), and NF-κB-inducing kinase have been reported to induce the phosphorylation of IKK (8Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar, 9Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). There are also other pathways that lead to IκB phosphorylation. Ultraviolet light is reported to induce NF-κB activation in the absence of IKK activation (10Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Although a great deal has been learned about the Rel family of transcription factors, researchers are only just beginning to understand the upstream regulation of these important proteins (11Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6842-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen intermediates, such as hydrogen peroxide, are also known to induce NF-κB activity in many cell types (12Carballo M. Marquez G. Conde M. Martin-Nieto J. Monteseirin J. Conde J. Pintado E. Sobrino F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 93-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Cooper J.T. Stroka D.M. Brostjan C. Palmetshofer A. Bach F.H. Ferran C. J.

Physiol. 2000; 279: L302-L311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to reactive oxygen intermediates, NF-κB activation has been reported following exposure of T lymphocytes to calcium ionophores, the tumor promoter PMA, or antibodies to the T-cell receptor (15Ginn-Pease M.E. Whisler R.L. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 346-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Understanding the signaling pathways induced by oxygen radicals, and the role that these pathways have in cell survival and death, could allow one to inhibit the survival pathways thereby promoting cell death. Oxygen radicals are also known to induce the production of several inflammatory cytokines that have NF-κB responsive promoters (16Halliwell B. Hoult J.R. Blake D.R. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2867-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 17Valen G. Erl W. Eriksson P. Wuttge D. Paulsson G. Hansson G.K.

Invest. 1988; 82: 2045-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Alternatively, one may be able to constrain the oxidant-induced production of these inflammatory mediators with CaM kinase inhibitors. The CaM kinases are a group of related kinases that are activated in response to increased calcium levels (reviewed in Ref. 19Soderling T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The primary members of this family which demonstrate broad substrate specificity are CaM kinase I, II, and IV. The other members of this family are dedicated to the phosphorylation of a single substrate (i.e.myosin light chain kinase, phosphorylase kinase, and elongation factor 2 kinase/CaM-KIII). CaM-KI is broadly distributed, CaM-KII is found in many tissues but is expressed at the highest level in neural tissue, whereas CaM-KIV is found primarily in brain, testes, and T lymphocytes. To elicit maximal activation of CaM-KII and CaM-KIV, both calmodulin-calcium complexes and phosphorylation events are thought to be required. However, the mechanism by which these two enzymes are phosphorylated differs. CaM-KII reportedly undergoes autophosphorylation upon calcium/calmodulin binding, whereas CaM-KIV is phosphorylated by the kinase CaM-KK (20Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Glod J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CaM-KK is activated by calcium/calmodulin complexes as well, but the potential for other means of regulation has been suggested (21Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Because CaM-KII and CaM-KK phosphorylate Akt (22Okuno S. Kitani T. Matsuzaki H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 965-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and Akt is reported to activate IKK, it is conceivable that the activation of the CaM kinases could have a role in NF-κB activation. In this report, we demonstrate that the CaM kinases also appear to have a role in hydrogen peroxide-induced IκB phosphorylation. The Jurkat cell line was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). The Wurzburg cell line was obtained through the kindness of Dr. Leonard Herzenberg (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from platelet-depleted blood by centrifugation over a Histopaque gradient. T lymphocytes were isolated as previously described by rosetting with sheep red blood cells (24Schwinzer R. Franklin R.A. Domenico J. Renz H. Gelfand E.W. J.

The isolated primary T cells were rested overnight in RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin prior to use. The COS-7 and 293T cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Anti-IκBα, anti-phospho-IκBα(Ser32/36), anti-phospho-IKK(Ser180/181), anti-Akt, and anti-phospho-Akt(Thr308) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-phospho-ERK (Thr183 and Tyr185) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). KN-92, KN-93, K252a, and BAPTA-AM were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and dissolved in Me2SO. Fluo-3 was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and dissolved in Me2SO. W-7 was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in Me2SO. Cells were washed and resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640. One ml, containing 1.25 × 106 cells, was added to microcentrifuge tubes and placed at 37 °C for at least 1 h prior to the start of the experiment. Cells were stimulated with hydrogen peroxide. Following stimulation for various times, the tubes were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 30 s, the supernatants were removed, cell pellets were resuspended in 110 μl of cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2% IGEPAL, 0.2% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μm leupeptin, 0.5 mmNa3VO4) and placed on ice for 15 min. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, supernatants (98 μl) were removed and mixed with 42 μl of 3.3× sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 33% glycerol, 6.6% SDS, 16.6% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.04% bromphenol blue). Samples were boiled (5 min) and frozen. Fifteen microliters of prepared samples were electrophoresed through a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide). Membranes were then incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer (anti-IκBα, 1:1,000; anti-phospho-IκBα(Ser32/36) 1:500), anti-phospho-IKK (Ser180/181), 1:1000; anti-Akt 1:1000, anti-phospho-Akt (Thr308) 1:1000 or anti-phospho-ERK 1:35,000). The blots were washed twice in TBST (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, 0.025% Tween 20) and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Promega, 1:10,000 in TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed twice in TBST and developed with the colorogenic substrates 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (Promega protoblot AP system). To determine the levels of intracellular calcium induced following stimulation, cells were loaded with Fluo-3. This was done by incubating 5 × 106 cells/ml for 30 min with 10 μm Fluo-3 at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 (serum- and phenol red-free). Following labeling, cells were washed and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cells were stimulated with OKT3 (5 μg/ml) cross-linked with rabbit anti-mouse Ig (5 μg/ml), or with hydrogen peroxide (1 mm) in the presence or absence of EGTA. To determine changes in intracellular calcium, fluorescence was monitored in 200 μl of cells (1 × 106) in black opaque 96-well Corning microtiter plates on a Bio-Tek FL600 fluorescence absorbance spectophotometer (Winooski, VT). The wavelength for excitation was 485 nm and emission was measured at 530 nm. Transient transfections were performed using either a truncated activable form of CaM-KIV, a kinase-dead CaM-KIV, or the empty vector pSG5 (26Chatila T., Ho, N. Liu P. Liu S. Mosialos G. Kieff E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5471-5479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. Briefly, 293T cells (grown to 60–70% confluence) were washed and placed in fresh media (10 ml). Twenty five μg of plasmid in 2.5 ml of 250 mm CaCl2 was added to an equal volume of 2 × HBS (280 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose) under constant agitation. This mixture was added to cells resulting in a final volume of 15 ml. Cells were then incubated for 10 h at 37 °C. Following this incubation, cells were washed and placed back into culture. Cells were then harvested 36 h after transfection and treated as indicated. COS-7 cells (5 × 106 cells per transfection) were transfected with 25 μg of plasmid DNA by electroporation at 400 kV and 500 microfarads using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II apparatus (Bio-Rad). COS-7 cells were harvested 36 h after transfection and treated as indicated. Cells (1.25 × 106 cells/ml) were treated with KN-93, KN-92, or Me2SO for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then stimulated for 30 min with hydrogen peroxide at 37 °C, the cells were then pelleted, the supernatant was removed, and the cellular pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 4% sulfosalicylic acid. The acidified samples were allowed to sit 1 h at room temperature and then frozen at −70 °C until they were assayed. Immediately prior to assaying the samples, they were diluted such that when assayed they had a final concentration of 1% 5-sulfosalicyclic acid. For determination of reduced GSH, 100 μl of sample was treated with 3.9 μl of a 1:4 dilution triethanolamine prior to assay to raise the pH to 7.0. For determination of GSSG, 100 μl of sample was treated with 3.9 μl of 2-vinylpyridine prior to the addition of 3.9 μl of a 1:4 dilution triethanolamine. Samples were then assayed using the enzymatic recycling assay described by Baker et al. (28Baker M. Cerniglia G. Zaman A. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of sample or standard was mixed with 100 μl of buffer (47.2 mm sodium phosphate, 472 μm EDTA, 226 μm 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid), 313 μm NADPH, 20 units of GSH reductase, pH 7.5) and the rate of the change in the optical density at 405 nm was determined over the linear part of the assay using a fluorescence/absorbance plate reader (FL600; Bio-Tek). For the Annexin-V/propidium iodide experiments cells were washed and treated for 150 min with the indicated concentration of hydrogen peroxide (1.25 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 with 5% FCS). Following treatment, cells were washed in PBS and suspended in Annexin-V binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2). To 100 μl of cells, 1 μl of Annexin-V (BD Biosciences) and 1 μl of propidium iodide (Sigma) were added. Cells were then mixed gently and incubated 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Following this incubation, 200 μl of binding buffer were added to each tube and cells were immediately analyzed. To examine subdiploid cells, cells were washed and treated for 150 min with the indicated concentration of hydrogen peroxide (2.5 ml; 1.25 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 with 5% FCS). The cells were then washed twice in cold PBS buffer (PBS + 2% fetal bovine serum), ensuring a single cell suspension and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in PBS buffer. Three ml of cold 100% ethanol was added to fix the cells (1 h at 4 °C). Cells were then washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. Five hundred μl of DNA extraction buffer (200 mmNa2HPO4 (dibasic), pH 7.8, and 100 mm citric acid) was added and the cells were incubated an additional 5 min at room temperature. Following this incubation the cells were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of propidium iodide staining solution (3.8 mm sodium citrate and 50 mg/ml propidium iodide in PBS) and 50 μl of RNase A (10 mg/ml), and incubated 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then placed on ice and analyzed by flow cytometery. We have found that treatment of Jurkat cells with hydrogen peroxide results in the phosphorylation of IκBα (Fig.1A). The shift in mobility noted on these immunoblots is reported to be because of phosphorylation of IκB (29Hughes K. Antonsson A. Grundstrom T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Neish A.S. Gewirtz A.T. Zeng H. Young A.N. Hobert M.E. Karmali V. Rao A.S. Madara J.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Unlike what was reported in other cell types, we have found that treatment of the Jurkat cell line with hydrogen peroxide does not result in IκB degradation. This is in agreement with the findings of others that demonstrate hydrogen peroxide treatment of Jurkat cells fails to induce NF-κB activity (31Anderson M.T. Staal F.J. Gitler C. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11527-11531Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Treatment of the Wurzburg cell line (a Jurkat cell derivative; Fig.1B) and primary T lymphocytes (T lymphocytes isolated from the peripheral blood by erythrocyte rosetting; Fig. 1C) with hydrogen peroxide did result in IκB degradation. It has been known for some time that Jurkat T cells are refractory in the ability to activate the transcription factor NF-κB in response to hydrogen peroxide when compared with the European Jurkat cell line derivative, Wurzburg (31Anderson M.T. Staal F.J. Gitler C. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11527-11531Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Because IκB is phosphorylated in these experiments and the degradation following IκB phosphorylation is the last step leading to NF-κB activation, we would have been surprised to see degradation occurring in Jurkat cells. The reason for the difference in the ability to degrade NF-κB between these two closely related cell lines (Jurkat and Wurzburg) is not known. Phosphorylation of IκB could be noted with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide in Jurkat cells. Although Jurkat cells require higher levels of hydrogen peroxide than other cell types to induce IκB phosphorylation, the advantage of using these cells is that they do not degrade IκB or activate NF-κB in response to oxidative stress. When IκB is degraded, it allows NF-κB to move to the nucleus were it can induce the transcription of genes with NF-κB-binding sites. One of the genes induced by NF-κB encodes for IκB (32Brown K. Park S. Kanno T. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2532-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). This could complicate studies examining IκB phosphorylation especially if the treatments altered the kinetics of the response. Transfection of other genes or the use of inhibitors that may have multiple roles both upstream and downstream of IκB could potentially lead to a misinterpretation of results, especially if they result in IκB transcription. Thus, there is an advantage to using the Jurkat cell line for experiments to identify the pathways leading to IκB phosphorylation and the activation of this important transcription factor. Using both the Jurkat cell line and the Wurzburg cell line together could provide an understanding of the mechanisms that control IκB degradation. Identifying the mechanisms that control IκB degradation would identify potential targets which could be used to regulate NF-κB activation. Methods to prevent the degradation of IκB could be used to sensitize some cancer cells to various cancer treatments. Because hydrogen peroxide is reported to cause a calcium flux in Jurkat T lymphocytes (33Sen C.K. Roy S. Packer L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and increases in intracellular calcium have been shown to induce (or synergize with other factors to induce) NF-κB activity in T cells and other cell types (32Brown K.

Endocrinol. 1994; 106: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), it was determined whether increases in intracellular calcium were involved in oxidative stress-induced IκB phosphorylation. It was found that EGTA, BAPTA-AM, nor a combination of both blocked IκB phosphorylation induced by oxidative stress (Fig. 1, A–C). We previously published (40Atherfold P.A. Norris M.S. Robinson P.J. Gelfand E.W. Franklin R.A. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that increases in intracellular calcium would induce ERK activation in Jurkat cells and primary T lymphocytes. EGTA alone or BAPTA-AM in conjunction with EGTA blocked ionomycin-induced ERK activation in parallel experiments (Fig.1D). These results suggest that increases in intracellular calcium are not required for oxidative stress-induced IκB phosphorylation. Concurrent to these experiments, we performed experiments using the CaM kinase inhibitor KN-93 and the inactive analog of KN-93, KN-92. We found that KN-93, but not the inactive analog KN-92, blocked hydrogen peroxide-induced IκB phosphorylation in both Jurkat and primary T lymphocytes (Fig.2). To assure that hydrogen peroxide-induced calcium flux was blocked in these cells, we treated Jurkat cells for 30 min with 2 mmEGTA (similar to Fig. 1). We then stimulated the cells with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide. We found, as has been previously reported, that both antibodies to the T cell receptor (OKT3) and hydrogen peroxide induced a calcium flux in these cells (Fig.3) (24Schwinzer R. Franklin R.A. Domenico J. Renz H. Gelfand E.W. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1322-1328PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sen C.K. Roy S. Packer L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Treatment of the Jurkat cells with EGTA, prior to stimulation with hydrogen peroxide, blocked increases in intracellular calcium (Fig. 3). These data demonstrate that we were able to block increases in intracellular calcium into these cells with EGTA. Another possible explanation for the results obtained using KN-93 is that it is acting as an antioxidant. To test this, we measured the levels of oxidized glutathione in cells in the presence of KN-93, as glutathione is the major antioxidant within cells (41Meister A. Anderson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5894) Google Scholar). Following an oxidative stress, one would expect to detect more glutathione in the oxidized form. This is exactly what was observed following hydrogen peroxide stimulation of Jurkat cells (Fig.4). The addition of KN-93 did not significantly alter the level of oxidized glutathione in either unstimulated or hydrogen peroxide-stimulated Jurkat cells. These data indicate that KN-93 is not acting as an antioxidant. We also performed experiments using a second CaM kinase inhibitor, K252a. This inhibitor, although it does not have a good negative control associated with it like KN-93, is structurally dissimilar to KN-93. We found that K252a (IC50 = 1.8 nm for CaM-kinase), like KN-93, blocked hydrogen peroxide-induced IκB phosphorylation (Fig. 5). The ability of multiple CaM kinase inhibitors to block this response strengthens the argument that these inhibitors are acting via CaM kinase and not nonspecifically. Although an increase in intracellular calcium is not required for IκB phosphorylation in response to hydrogen peroxide, the CaM kinases appear to be required. These were surprising results and suggested that in response to hydrogen peroxide calcium-independent activation of the CaM kinases was occurring. In a recent article by Hughes et al. (51Hughes K. Edin S. Antonsson A. Grundstrom T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36008-36013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) it was demonstrated that PMA, which is not known to increase levels of intracellular calcium in T lymphocytes, induced NF-κB activation in a CaM kinase-dependent manner. We have repeated some of these experiments and we too found that KN-93, but not KN-92, inhibited IκB degradation in response to PMA (Fig.6). The mechanism of activation of CaM-KII and CaM-IV is thought to differ, however, both reportedly require calmodulin-calcium complexes. For maximal activity CaM-KII and CaM-KIV are also reported to require phosphorylation. The mechanism by which these two enzymes are phosphorylated differs. CaM-KII reportedly undergoes autophosphorylation upon calcium/calmodulin binding and CaM-KIV is phosphorylated by the kinase CaM-KK (20Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Glod J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CaM-KK is reportedly activated by calcium/calmodulin complexes as well, but the potential for other means of regulation has been suggested (21Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CaM-KIV by CaM-KK occurs in the pseudosubstrate subdomain that is contained in a regulatory domain and interacts with the catalytic domain of the kinase. Once phosphorylated these kinases retain catalytic activity even after calcium levels decrease. The phosphatases PP1 and PP2A have been reported to cleave the phosphate group off of CaM-KII rendering it inactive. The phosphatase PP2A has been reported to cleave the phosphate off of CaM-KIV (42Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It is known that hydrogen peroxide and okadaic acid will inhibit PP2A and PP1 (43Bogumil R. Namgaladze D. Schaarschmidt D.

For this reason, understanding the pathways that lead to cardiomyocyte apoptosis and identifying strategies to modulate this process may have important clinical implications. Programmed cell death or apoptosis is a tightly regulated, organized, and energy-dependent cellular process characterized by nuclear and DNA fragmentation and condensation, membrane blebbing, and cellular shrinkage (4Green D.R.

Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Although a fully comprehensive model of apoptosis has not yet been assembled, two general pathways have been delineated (7Yuan J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 8Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 781-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway, apoptosis occurs when specific stimuli lead to mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, usually in association with alterations of mitochondrial membrane potential (8Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 781-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c binds Apaf-1 in the cytosol and induces its oligomerization and the subsequent recruitment of pro-caspase-9. This culminates in the activation of caspase-9, which, in turn, cleaves and activates caspase-3. The pathways leading to the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c are not fully understood, although it classically occurs in cells deprived of specific growth factors or critical metabolic substrates (8Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 781-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In the extrinsic or death receptor (DR)1 (e.g.TNFR60, Fas/Apo1, or TRAIL-R/Apo2) pathway, ligand binding to DR leads to the recruitment and activation of caspase-8 through specific adaptor molecules such as the Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) (9Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 8145: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). Deletion of the N-terminal “death effector domain” of FADD creates a dominant negative (FADD-dn) that binds the cytoplasmic domains of DR but cannot activate caspase-8 (10Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The ability of FADD-dn to block apoptosis provides presumptive evidence for the involvement of cell death receptors (9Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M.

DR and FADD activation of caspase-8 leads to cleavage and activation of the effector, caspase-3, and cell death. The two pathways co-exist in many circumstances. For example, activated caspase-8 can cleave and activate the pro-apoptotic Bcl-family member, Bid (15Li H. Zhu H., Xu, C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar). Cleaved Bid then inserts into the mitochondrial membrane, inducing changes in membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c (15Li H. Zhu H., Xu, C.J. Yuan J.

Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). In some settings, this amplification of DR signaling via cytochromec release is important to the overall level of apoptosis produced (15Li H. Zhu H., Xu, C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have suggested a role for the mitochondrial pathway in hypoxia and serum deprivation (SD)-induced cardiomyocyte (CM) apoptosis. In the neonatal rat CM, SD or hypoxia in the absence of glucose lead to CM apoptosis and cytochrome c release (19Bialik S. Cryns V.L. Drincic A. Miyata S. Wollowick A.L. Srinivasan A. Kitsis R.N. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar,20Malhotra R. Brosius III, F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12567-12575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the adult rat CM, reoxygenation after hypoxia leads to caspase-3 and -9 activation, cytochrome c release, and apoptotic cell death (21Kang P.M. Haunstetter A. Aoki H. Usheva A. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Bcl2 seems to play an important role in regulating cytochrome c release and caspase activation in response to hypoxia and reoxygenation in the adult CM (21Kang P.M. Haunstetter A. Aoki H. Usheva A. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with recent studies in fibroblasts suggesting that oxygen and glucose deprivation induce fibroblast apoptosis primarily through a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to the release of cytochrome c and caspase-9 activation (22McClintock D.S. Santore M.T. Lee V.Y. Brunelle J. Budinger G.R. Zong W.X. Thompson C.B. Hay N. Chandel N.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, other studies suggest a role for DR signaling in CM apoptosis. Fas and Fas-L are constitutively expressed in CM (23Tanaka M. Ito H. Adachi S. Akimoto H. Nishikawa T. Kasajima T. Marumo F. Hiroe M. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 24Wollert K.C. Heineke J. Westermann J. Ludde M. Fiedler B. Zierhut W. Laurent D. Bauer M.K. Schulze-Osthoff K.

Circulation. 2000; 102: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Moreover, ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in vivo induces the release of soluble Fas-L, sTNFα, and TRAIL (25Jeremias I. Kupatt C. Martin-Villalba A. Habazettl H. Schenkel J. Boekstegers P. Debatin K.M. Circulation. 2000; 102: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Fas-L, TRAIL, and TNF-α induce significant CM death under hypoxic but not normoxic conditions and in a cycloheximide-dependent manner (25Jeremias I. Kupatt C. Martin-Villalba A. Habazettl H. Schenkel J. Boekstegers P. Debatin K.M. Circulation. 2000; 102: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In an isolated Langendorff perfused rat heart model, reperfusion induces the activation of caspase-8 and the cleavage of Bid (26Scarabelli T.M. Stephanou A. Pasini E. Comini L. Raddino R. Knight R.A. Latchman D.S. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Moreover, in a similar model, hearts from lpr mice that lack functional Fas demonstrated a marked reduction in cell death after IRI compared with wild-type controls (25Jeremias I. Kupatt C. Martin-Villalba A. Habazettl H. Schenkel J. Boekstegers P. Debatin K.M. Circulation. 2000; 102: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, possible developmental confounders or compensatory alterations in these mutant mice are difficult to exclude. Moreover, others have questioned the relevance of Fas-mediated CM apoptosis, because an agonistic anti-Fas antibody administered systemically promotes hepatocyte but not CM apoptosis (24Wollert K.C. Heineke J. Westermann J. Ludde M. Fiedler B. Zierhut W. Laurent D. Bauer M.K. Schulze-Osthoff K. Drexler H. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1172-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the present study, we explored the mechanisms of CM apoptosis induced by hypoxia and SD in vitro. Hypoxia/SD induced rapid activation of caspase-8 and -3 as well as CM apoptosis. To examine the functional contribution of DR signaling and caspase-8 activation in this model, we constructed recombinant adenoviral vectors (Ad) carrying wild-type (wt) and dominant negative forms of FADD. Our results with these genetic manipulations as well as the pharmacological inhibition of caspase-8 suggest a surprisingly important contribution of FADD/caspase-8 signaling to apoptosis of CM subjected to hypoxia/SD. The neonatal cardiomyocyte isolation system was from Worthington. The caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) was purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA) and zIETD-fmk from R&D Systems. All other protease inhibitors were purchased fromCalbiochem. Polyclonal caspase-3 antibodies were from Cell Signaling(Beverly, MA). Anti-FADD (H-181) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. β-actin antibody was from Sigma. A cell death detection ELISA kit was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Caspase-8, -9, and -3 activity assay kits were from R&D Systems. CMs were prepared from 1–2 day-old rats by digestion using trypsin and collagenase as described previously (27Matsui T., Li, L. del Monte F. Fukui Y. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). All CMs were incubated in RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, and 0.2% d-glucose. CMs were used for viral infection or treatment 3–4 days after plating. Unless specified, all hypoxia treatments consisted of 95% N2 balanced with 5% CO2 in serum-free RPMI 1640 in an air-tight humidified chamber at 37 °C as described previously (27Matsui T., Li, L. del Monte F. Fukui Y. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). For DNA laddering, 1.5 μg of genomic DNA fragments were 32P-labeled by Klenow DNA polymerase and separated in agarose gel as described previously (27Matsui T., Li, L. del Monte F. Fukui Y. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Histone-associated DNA fragments were quantified by cell death detection ELISA as described in the manufacturer's protocol. DNA fragmentation data were corrected for background and normalized to the result with normoxic cardiomyocytes. Cultured CMs were scraped and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell suspension was then spun down, and cell pellets were lysed for 30 min in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) and spun down 14,000 rpm for 10 min in an Eppendorf tube as described previously. Proteins were then separated in 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nonspecific protein binding was blocked in blocking buffer (5% milk, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and blotted with specific antibodies as indicated for each experiment in the blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. For repeated blotting, nitrocellulose membranes were stripped with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) at room temperature for 30 min. Caspase-3, -8, and -9 activity was examined by using the caspase colorimetric assay kit from R&D Systems according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were scraped and transferred to 15-ml tubes. The cell suspension was centrifuged and washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellets were then lysed in 120 μl of cold lysis buffer. Cell lysates (150–250 μg of protein) were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min. The supernatants were removed and assayed for caspase activity. The specific peptide substrates used for each individual caspase were DEAD-pNA, LEHD-pNA, and IETD-pNA for caspase-3, -9, and -8, respectively. Release of the pNA cleavage product was quantitated in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) at a wavelength of 405 nm. Four replication-deficient recombinant Ad vectors were employed in the present study. Ad.FADD-wt and Ad.FADD-dn carry separate CMV-driven expression cassettes for FADD and GFP and were constructed by subcloning the cDNA for human FADD-wt and FADD-dn (kindly provided by Dr. Vishva Dixit, University of Michigan and Genentech) into pAdTrackCMV and obtaining homologous recombinants through co-transformation with pAdEasy-1 inEscherichia coli BJ 5183 cells as described previously (28He T. Zhou S. da Costa L., Yu, J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Ad.IGF-I carries separate CMV-driven expression cassettes for insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and the GFP and was constructed by subcloning the cDNA for human IGF-IB (kindly provided by Dr. P. S. Rotwein) as described above for Ad.FADD. Ad.GFP is structurally similar to Ad.IGF-I but encodes the GFP only. Viral titer was determined by plaque assay in 293 cells. Stock titers were >1010plaque-forming units (pfu)/ml for each vector with a particle/pfu ratio of 10–100. Wild-type adenovirus contamination was excluded by the absence of PCR-detectable E1 sequences. All data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments and evaluated with a two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test. The null hypothesis was rejected for p < 0.05. The combination of hypoxia and SD induced a time-dependent cleavage of 35-kDa pro-caspase-3 with the appearance of the 19-kDa active form of caspase-3 (Fig.1A). The processing of pro-caspase-3 to caspase-3 occurred early, within 2 h of hypoxia/SD, and reached its maximal level within 4 h. The time course of pro-caspase-3 cleavage in response to hypoxia/SD corresponded well with measured caspase-3 activity, which also plateaued within 4 h (Fig. 1B). To delineate the individual contribution of serum deprivation and hypoxia to CM apoptosis, CMs were subjected to hypoxia and SD alone or in combination. As shown in Fig.1, C and D, within 4 h of SD there was significant DNA laddering as well as caspase-3 cleavage and activation even in the absence of hypoxia. The combination of hypoxia and SD modestly increased the level of caspase-3 activation (Fig.1D) and DNA laddering at 4 h (Fig. 1C) compared with SD alone. In the presence of serum, hypoxia for up to 24 h failed to induce caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1, C and D). These results suggest that neonatal cardiomyocytes are much more sensitive to serum deprivation than to hypoxia. To define the functional importance of caspase activation in hypoxia/SD-induced CM apoptosis, we examined the effect of the general caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, on hypoxia/SD-induced DNA fragmentation. The treatment of CMs with zVAD-fmk at concentrations ranging from 50–100 μminhibited hypoxia/SD-induced apoptosis as evidenced by ELISA for histone-associated DNA fragmentation (Fig.2A) and DNA laddering (Fig.2B), confirming the functional importance of caspase activation in this model.FIG. 2Effect of zVAD-fmk on hypoxia/SD-induced DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation/concentration dependence.Cells were washed and incubated with zVAD-fmk or vehicle alone in serum-free medium for 1 h prior to hypoxia. DNA fragmentation was examined using an ELISA for histone-associated DNA fragments (A) or DNA laddering (B). A, DNA fragmentation ELISA. Cells were left untreated or treated with zVAD-fmk for 1 h prior to 4 h of hypoxia. Fragmentation seen in treated cells is shown as percent of that seen in hypoxic cells without zVAD-fmk pretreatment. Each data point represents the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. *, p < 0.01.B, DNA laddering. Cells were treated as above but subjected to 24 h of hypoxia.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To explore the role of DR signaling in hypoxia/SD-induced CM apoptosis, we examined the activity of the apical DR caspase, caspase-8. Hypoxia/SD induced a time-dependent increase in caspase-8 activity that reached a maximal level within 4 h (Fig.3). These data suggested that caspase-8 activation also occurs early in hypoxia/SD and could contribute to caspase-3 activation and the overall apoptosis observed. To delineate the functional contribution of DR signaling in this model, we constructed recombinant Ad vectors carrying the wild-type and dominant negative forms of FADD and used these vectors to transduce rat neonatal CMs subjected to hypoxia/SD. As shown in Fig.4A, adenoviral gene transfer induced dose-dependent expression of the FADD-dn protein in CM (Fig. 4A). Hypoxia and SD induced up to a 3.8-fold increase in DNA fragmentation within 24 h in CMs infected with control virus. Adenoviral expression of FADD-dn but not FADD-wt dramatically reduced the apoptotic effect of hypoxia/SD as demonstrated by histone-DNA fragmentation ELISA and DNA laddering (Fig. 4). Similarly, adenoviral expression of IGF-I, which has a known cardioprotective effect, also inhibited DNA laddering in CM (Fig.4C). The anti-apoptotic effect of FADD-dn in CMs was moi-dependent as demonstrated by DNA laddering (24-h hypoxia) (Fig. 4D). To confirm these results, we employed a specific caspase-8 inhibitor, zIETD-fmk. Both the activation of caspase-8 and CM apoptosis in response to 4 h hypoxia/SD were also completely inhibited by zIETD-fmk (Fig. 4E). Together, these data suggest that FADD signaling to caspase-8 is necessary for hypoxia/SD-induced CM apoptosis. In contrast, the overexpression of FADD-wt induced significant DNA fragmentation even under normoxic conditions in the presence of serum (Fig. 4F). Hypoxia/SD did not further enhance DNA fragmentation induced by FADD-wt overexpression (Fig. 4F). These results establish that FADD is necessary for hypoxia/SD-induced activation of caspase-8 as well as CM apoptosis and is sufficient for CM apoptosis. We were surprised by the degree of protection afforded by the inhibition of FADD/caspase-8 and therefore examined whether these interventions were sufficient to inhibit caspase-3 activation. As shown in Fig. 5, in the presence of serum and normoxia there was minimal activation of caspase-3 in uninfected control cells. Neither Ad.GFP nor Ad.FADD-dn infection significantly affected caspase-3 activity at baseline. However, hypoxia/SD induced significant activation of caspase-3 (up to 3-fold) in both uninfected and Ad.GFP-infected CMs. Importantly, adenoviral expression of FADD-dn significantly inhibited the processing and activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 5). Moreover, consistent with its effect on DNA fragmentation, the overexpression of FADD-wt resulted in a significant increase in caspase-3 activity, although the processing of pro-caspase-3 was not evident by immunoblotting, most likely reflecting the greater sensitivity of the enzymatic assay (Fig. 5). Because the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway appears to play a primary role in some models of hypoxia-induced apoptosis (22McClintock D.S. Santore M.T. Lee V.Y. Brunelle J. Budinger G.R. Zong W.X. Thompson C.B. Hay N. Chandel N.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we were surprised that this pathway did not induce more robust CM apoptosis even in the face of FADD inhibition. Therefore, we examined the activation of caspase-9, the apical caspase in the mitochondrial pathway, in CMs subjected to hypoxia/SD as well as the effects of FADD-dn overexpression or zIETD-fmk treatment. As expected, both zIETD-fmk (Fig. 4E) and the overexpression of FADD-dn (Fig.6A) effectively blocked hypoxia/SD-induced caspase-8 activation in CMs. Surprisingly, the activation of caspase-9 was also completely inhibited by pretreatment with zIETD-fmk or the overexpression of FADD-dn (Fig. 6B). Together, these results suggest that both FADD and caspase-8 act upstream of caspase-9 and play a dominant role in CM apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and hypoxia. Although CM apoptosis has been well documented in bothin vivo and in vitro models of ischemic heart disease, the intracellular signaling mechanisms leading to CM death in these settings has not been fully defined. Several previous reports have demonstrated that the mitochondrial pathway plays a role in CM apoptosis. The present study was designed to examine the role of DR signaling in CM apoptosis through manipulation of the critical adaptor molecule FADD. We found that the combination of serum deprivation and hypoxia caused rapid activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3 as well as DNA fragmentation. Adenoviral expression of FADD-dn as well as treatment with the specific caspase-8 inhibitor zIETD-fmk dramatically inhibited CM apoptosis and the activation of caspase-8,-9, and -3. In contrast, the expression of wild-type FADD induced caspase-3 activation and CM apoptosis. Together, these data demonstrate an important role for FADD signaling in the early caspase activation induced by hypoxia/SD in CM and suggest that in this system FADD-mediated activation of caspase-8 occurs upstream of caspase-9 activation. Our work is consistent with prior studies demonstrating the general importance of caspases in cardiomyocyte apoptosis in both in vivo and in vitro models of ischemia (19Bialik S. Cryns V.L.

Consistent with the previous studies, serum-deprivation but not hypoxia alone caused rapid activation of caspase-9 and -3 in cultured neonatal rat CM, and the general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk prevented CM apoptosis. To our knowledge, however, our data are the first to demonstrate that hypoxia/SD-induced activation of caspase-9 and -3 occurs downstream of FADD and caspase-8 activation in CMs and that FADD signaling is both necessary and sufficient for CM apoptosis in this setting. However, precedent exists for a critical role of caspase-8 in hypoxia-induced apoptosis in other systems. For example, in Jurkat cells hypoxia induces apoptotic cell death that can be effectively inhibited by overexpression of the caspase-8 inhibitor v-FLIP (31Malhotra R. Lin Z. Vincenz C. Brosius III, F.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1596-C1603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies contrast with work (22McClintock D.S. Santore M.T. Lee V.Y. Brunelle J. Budinger G.R. Zong W.X. Thompson C.B. Hay N. Chandel N.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) in fibroblasts demonstrating a primary role for the mitochondrial pathway in hypoxia-mediated apoptosis. These differences may reflect important differences between the cells being studied and/or the specifics of the experimental conditions employed. For example, McClintock et al. (22McClintock D.S. Santore M.T. Lee V.Y. Brunelle J. Budinger G.R. Zong W.X. Thompson C.B. Hay N. Chandel N.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) found that an activated mutant of the serine/threonine kinase Akt was not able to protect fibroblasts from apoptosis after hypoxia (22McClintock D.S. Santore M.T. Lee V.Y. Brunelle J. Budinger G.R. Zong W.X. Thompson C.B. Hay N. Chandel N.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have demonstrated that Akt can protect CM from hypoxia-induced apoptosis in vitro (27Matsui T., Li, L. del Monte F. Fukui Y. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and ischemia reperfusion-induced apoptosis in vivo (32Matsui T. Tao J. del Monte F. Lee K.-H., Li, L. Picard M. Force T.L. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Thus, the signaling pathways controlling cell death may function differently in these cell types. However, the precise conditions utilized may also be critical. McClintock et al. (22McClintock D.S. Santore M.T. Lee V.Y. Brunelle J. Budinger G.R. Zong W.X. Thompson C.B. Hay N. Chandel N.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) found that the intrinsic pathway was most powerfully activated by the combination of hypoxia and glucose deprivation. In the current study as well as in a study by Malhotra et al. (31Malhotra R. Lin Z. Vincenz C. Brosius III, F.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1596-C1603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) involving Jurkat cells, cells were cultured in glucose-containing media to define the effects of hypoxia alone or in combination with serum-deprivation. Similarly, previous work demonstrated that the mitochondrial death pathway is activated in CMs by the combination of serum and glucose deprivation (19Bialik S. Cryns V.L. Drincic A. Miyata S. Wollowick A.L. Srinivasan A. Kitsis R.N. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) even in the presence of oxygen. Consistent with these results (19Bialik S. Cryns V.L. Drincic A. Miyata S. Wollowick A.L. Srinivasan A. Kitsis R.N. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 22McClintock D.S. Santore M.T. Lee V.Y. Brunelle J. Budinger G.R. Zong W.X. Thompson C.B. Hay N. Chandel N.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), in the presence of glucose we saw no significant increase in cytochromec release in CMs subjected to hypoxia/SD (data not shown). Our data also provide evidence for cross-talk between these pathways in CMs, because caspase-9 activation was dependent on FADD signaling via caspase-8. However, it remains unclear how caspase-8 activation induced activation of caspase-9 because (as noted above) we did not observe a significant increase in cytochrome c release. Unfortunately, our efforts to identify Bid cleavage in this rat system using available antibody reagents have thus far been unsuccessful (data not shown), although Bid cleavage would be expected to induce caspase-9 activation through cytochrome c release, which we did not observe. Thus, the possibility that previously unappreciated connections exist between the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis appears worthy of further investigation (Fig. 7). The assays utilized in this report are based on the highly stringent substrate specificities of the caspases themselves, which have been rigorously determined through use of a positional scanning combinatorial library (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility that other caspases contribute to the specific activity measurements presented in the current study appears unlikely but difficult to completely exclude. Moreover, these considerations would not alter the central conclusion of the present study as to the surprising importance of DR/FADD signaling in hypoxia/SD-induced CM apoptosis. Other limitations of this study should also be acknowledged. We did not identify which death receptor is involved in signaling via FADD. Although the Fas/Fas-L system is a reasonable candidate because it is expressed in CM and induced by hypoxia (23Tanaka M. Ito H. Adachi S. Akimoto H. Nishikawa T. Kasajima T. Marumo F. Hiroe M. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 25Jeremias I. Kupatt C. Martin-Villalba A. Habazettl H. Schenkel J. Boekstegers P. Debatin K.M. Circulation. 2000; 102: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), multiple receptors (e.g. TNFR60, Fas/Apo1, or TRAIL-R/Apo2) can signal through FADD and can, under some circumstances, do so in a ligand-independent manner (11Sheikh M.S. Antinore M.J. Huang Y. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Sanchez I., Xu, C.J. Juo P. Kakizaka A. Blenis J. Yuan J.

Thus, defining the functional importance of these various upstream pathways will be a complex but valuable undertaking. Finally, we have also focused on a simple in vitro model of apoptosis induced by hypoxia/SD in rat neonatal CM. The relevance of these findings to the adult CM in an intact heart remains to be demonstrated. The vectors described in this study should provide valuable tools for such an investigation. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that FADD signaling via caspase-8 is necessary for hypoxia/SD-induced CM apoptosis and is sufficient for apoptosis of normoxic CM. Delineation of the intracellular signaling pathways leading to CM apoptosis in different settings may lead to novel therapeutic approaches in ischemic or other heart disease.

The specificity constant for the phosphorylation of GST-Pyk1 and GST-Pyk2 by bovine catalytic subunit was in the range of the value for Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide). Both fusion proteins were phosphorylated in vivo, in intact cells overexpressing the protein, or in vitro using crude extracts, as source of protein kinase A, when a wild type strain was used but were not phosphorylated when using a strain with only one TPK gene with an attenuated mutation (tpk1w1). The effect of phosphorylation on Pyk activity was assayed in partially purified preparations from three strains, containing different endogenous protein kinase A activity levels. Pyk1 activity was measured at different phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations in the absence or in the presence of the activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate at 1.5 mm. Preliminary kinetic results derived from the comparison of Pyk1 obtained from extracts with the highest versusthose from the lowest protein kinase A activity indicate that the enzyme is more active upon phosphorylation conditions; in the absence of the activator it shows a shift in the titration curve for phosphoenolpyruvate to the left and an increase in the Hill coefficient, whereas in the presence of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate it shows an nH value of 1.4, as compared with annH of 2 for the Pyk1 obtained from extracts with almost null protein kinase A activity.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein kinase A (PKA)1 lies at the heart of an important signal transduction pathway with key elements identified principally in the 1980s. The PKA regulatory subunit is encoded by theBCY1 gene, and the catalytic subunits are encoded by the redundant TPK1, TPK2, and TPK3 genes (1Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Wigler M. Cell. 1987; 50: 227-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 2Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Scott J.D. McBullen B. Hurwitz M. Krebs E.G. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In yeast, the PKA pathway controls many different targets at the post-translational and transcriptional levels and has been implicated in several different but interdependent cellular reactions in response to changes in environmental conditions (3Thevelein J.M. de Winde J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 904-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Glucose is the preferred carbon source of S. cerevisiae and as such is a crucial regulator of cellular physiology. Transport and phosphorylation of the sugar are required for most of its regulatory effects. PKA is involved in one of the main regulatory systems transducing glucose signals. Glucose triggers a rapid and transient increase in the levels of the second messenger cAMP, synthesized by adenylate cyclase, which is stimulated either by Ras proteins (possibly by reacting to intracellular acidification) or by glucose via the Gpr1-Gpa2 G-protein system (3Thevelein J.M. de Winde J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 904-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 4Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 310-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Yeast cells, like other organisms or cells able to carry out glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, have developed multiple regulatory mechanisms to avoid the simultaneous operation of these antagonistic metabolic pathways (5Entian K.D. Barnett J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 506-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Navas M.A. Gancedo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1809-1812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKA has an input on this process by regulation of some key enzymes either transcriptionally or post-translationally. Although it may be clear that the activity of the enzyme targets is regulated in response to PKA, it is frequently difficult to be sure that the activation or inhibition of their activity is a direct effect. Well known (direct or indirect) targets of PKA phosphorylation are 1) enzymes involved in trehalose synthesis and degradation, including trehalase and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase; 2) those involved in glycogen synthesis and degradation, such as glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase; and 3) those enzymes involved in the glycolytic flux, such as phosphofructokinase and fructose-bisphosphatase (3Thevelein J.M. de Winde J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 904-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 7Dickinson J.R. Schweizer M. Dickinson J.R. Schweizer M. The Metabolism and Molecular Physiology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Taylor & Francis Ltd, London1999: 209-275Google Scholar). A less known target is pyruvate kinase, whose in vitro phosphorylation by PKA has recently been reported (8Cytryñska M. Frajnt M. Jakubowicz T. FEMS Microb. Lett. 2001; 203: 223-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rayner T.F. Gray J.V. Thorner J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16814-16822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The level of expression ofPFK26 and PFK27 genes, coding for 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, depend on the carbon source, via a cAMP pathway (10Gonçalves P.M. Griffioen G. Bebelman J.P. Planta R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the presence of fermentable sugars yeast glycolysis is fully activated; the initiation of the glycolytic flux seems to rely on the coordinated triggering of multiple events, including allosteric regulation of enzymatic activities, protein modification, and modulation of gene expression. The main objective of our group is to study the mechanism of in vivo activation of PKA by cAMP and the participation of the substrate in this process using lower eukaryotic models (11Zaremberg V. Moreno S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 12Zaremberg V. Donnella-Deana A. Moreno S. Arch. Biochem.

While looking for PKA substrates in S. cerevisiae, we found that both isoforms of pyruvate kinase, Pyk1 and Pyk2, are substrates of PKA. Pyk 1 is the last enzyme in the glycolytic pathway of sugar catabolism; it catalyzes the irreversible conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate by the addition of a proton and the loss of a phosphate group, which is transferred to ADP. The enzyme is allosterically activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), and its gene expression is dependent on the presence of glucose in the culture medium (15Jurica M.S. Mesecar A. Heath P.J. Shi W. Nowak T. Stoddard B.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 195-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Mck1, a member of the glycogen synthase kinase 3 family, has been reported to be a negative regulator of Pyk1 (16Brazill D.T. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4415-4418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) through the negative regulation of its phosphorylation by PKA (9Rayner T.F. Gray J.V. Thorner J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16814-16822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). With the completion of the yeast genome sequencing project, an open reading frame coding for a protein with high homology to Pyk1 has been reported. The characterization of this gene indicated the existence of a Pyk2 protein, which is insensitive to FBP and whose expression is repressed by glucose (17Boles E. Schulte F. Miosga T. Freidel K. Schlüter E. Zimmermann F.K. Hollenberg C.P. Heinisch J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2987-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this work we identify both Pyk1 and Pyk2 asin vitro and in vivo substrates of PKA, characterize their behavior as PKA substrates, and present a preliminary study of the effect of phosphorylation on the kinetics of pyruvate kinase.

Open table in a new tab The vector pEG(KG) contains the GST gene cloned downstream of the galactose-inducible CYC1 promoter (21Mitchell D.A. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Yeast. 1993; 9: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were transformed by the lithium acetate method (22Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast media were prepared as described previously (23Sherman F. Fink G. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981Google Scholar). Strains were grown on rich medium containing 2% Bactopeptone, 1% yeast extract, and 2% galactose (YPgal) or 2% glucose (YPG). Synthetic media containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and 2% glucose plus the necessary additions to fulfill auxotrophic requirements were used to maintain the selectable plasmids (SD). Solid media contained 2% agar. C subunit activity was determined by assay of phosphotransferase activity with Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) as substrate. The assay was started by mixing the different amounts of PKA coming from different sources (protein kinase catalytic subunit from bovine heart (Cb), semi-purified HA-Tpk1, HA-Tpk1·Bcy1 complex, or crude extract) with assay mixture to give 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer PA), 0.1 mm[γ-32P] ATP (700 dpm/pmol) plus 200 μmKemptide and 10 μm cAMP, when added. After 15 min at 30 °C, aliquots were processed according to the phosphocellulose paper method (24Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). PKA assays were linear with time and protein concentration. PKA activity is expressed in units: one unit is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the incorporation of 1 pmol of phosphate to protein substrate per minute at pH 7.4 at 30 °C. Cb was reconstituted in 50 mm dithiothreitol and the units used in the assays (expressed as picomoles of phosphate incorporated to a synthetic substrate per minute) were estimated according to the instructions of the manufacturer, except when indicated, where the activity was assayed under our standard assay conditions. Strain1115+HA-TPK1+YEp51-BCY1 was grown in YPgal medium during 16 h at 30 °C. Cells were lysed by disruption with glass beads at 4 °C in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7; 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml antipain, and 0.5% Triton X-100 (buffer A). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 ×g for 5 min, and the crude extract was used to immunoprecipitate HA-Tpk1·Bcy1 complex. A 0.5-ml aliquot of crude extract (2.5 mg/ml) was incubated with anti-HA (4 mg/ml) antibody or nonspecific antibody during 1 h at 4 °C, followed by addition of A/G agarose (30 μl), and incubation for 16 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed with 5 ml of buffer A plus 0.1m NaCl. Phosphorylation of immunoprecipitates was performed by incubation with 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (700 dpm/pmol) in buffer PA, plus 10 μm cAMP, when added. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue, destained, and autoradiographed. Protein kinase activity of aliquots of each immunoprecipitate was assayed under the standard assay conditions. The selected protein bands were excised, washed, reduced, and S-alkylated essentially as described (25Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fostsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). A sufficient volume of 2 ng/μl trypsin in 5 mm NH4HCO3 was added to cover the gel pieces, and digestion was performed overnight at 32 °C in an incubator. The digests were then acidified by the addition of a 1/10 vol. of 2% trifluoroacetic acid prior to MALDI analysis. A Reflex III matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany), equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser and a Scout-384 probe, was used to obtain positive ion mass spectra of digested protein with pulsed ion extraction in reflectron mode. An accelerating voltage of 26 kV was used with detector bias gating set to 2 kV and a mass cut-off ofm/z 650. Thin-layer matrix surfaces of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid mixed with nitrocellulose were prepared as described previously (26Shevchenko A. Jensen O. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). An aliquot (0.4 μl) of acidified digestion supernatant was deposited onto the thin layer and allowed to dry prior to desalting with water. Mass spectra were clean and interpretable. Peptide mass fingerprints thus obtained were searched against the non-redundant protein data base placed in the public domain by NCBI, using the program MASCOT (27Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J.C. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6776) Google Scholar). Cell patches of EJ758-YOR347C and EJ758-YAL038W were inoculated in SD-Ura liquid medium, grown overnight, and re-inoculated into SD-Ura-Leu, grown to A600 = 0.8, and induced with 0.5 mm Cu2SO4 for 2 h before harvest. Cells were homogenized with glass beads in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 m NaCl plus 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 3 μg/ml antipain (buffer B). The GST protein was purified from crude extract of 1115+GST cultures induced by adding galactose to a final concentration of 2% (21Mitchell D.A. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Yeast. 1993; 9: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). GST protein and GST-Pyk1 and GST-Pyk2 fusion proteins were purified by glutathione agarose chromatography in buffer B plus 1 mNaCl. Proteins were eluted by 1 h incubation at 37 °C with buffer B, 1 m NaCl, 40 mm glutathione, 20 mm dithiothreitol. After dialysis in buffer, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 55 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol, the preparations were stored in aliquots at −20 °C. The efficiency of elution of either GST-Pyk1 and GST-Pyk2 was low; therefore, for the experiments of Figs. 4 and 5, where a high concentration of the proteins was needed, the GST fusion proteins were used bound to the glutathione-agarose. The protein concentration of the immobilized enzyme was estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of the proteins eluted with loading buffer and run on SDS-PAGE.FIG. 5Kinetic behavior of in vitrophosphorylation of GST-Pyk1 and GST-Pyk2 by catalytic subunit from bovine heart PKA. Immobilized GST-Pyk1 (5 μm) and GST-Pyk2 (3 μm) were incubated with the indicated amounts (units/40 μl) of Cb subunit and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1000 dpm/pmol) for 15 min at 30 °C (panel A). In panel B, 2 units/40 μl of Cb and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1000 dpm/pmol) were incubated with the indicated concentration of GST-Pyk1 or GST-Pyk2. After incubation, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The incorporation of phosphate into the substrate was determined by scintillation counting of the phosphorylated enzyme band excised from SDS-PAGE gels. Phosphorylation of Kemptide was determined by the phosphocellulose paper method. A portion of the autoradiograms, including the position of pyruvate kinase, is shown above each panel. Panel C, the specificity constants (kcat/Km) expressed as pmol·(min·unit)−1μm−1, calculated for GST-Pyk1 and GST-Pyk2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The estimated parameters used for Kemptide wereKm = 45 μm and kcat = 17 pmol/min·unit. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. from two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Semi-purification of HA-Tpk1 was performed by immunoprecipitation from crude extract of1115+HA-TPK1 strain grown for 16 h at 30 °C in SD-Ura. The immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-HA (4 mg/ml) or nonspecific antibody (rabbit preimmune serum) as described above. The immunoprecipitates were washed first with buffer A plus 1m NaCl, followed by a wash with buffer A. Protein kinase activity of the immunoprecipitated HA-Tpk1 was determined under the standard assay conditions. This HA-Tpk1 preparation displayed a −/+ cAMP activity ratio of 0.9 and a Km value of 50 μm for Kemptide (data not shown; comparable to value reported in Ref. 28Denis C.L. Kemp B.E. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17932-17935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro phosphorylation assays were performed in a final volume of 40 μl using partially purified HA-Tpk1 (as described above) or Cb (of commercial origin) as PKA source. The assay was started by mixing the substrates GST-Pyk1 and GST-Pyk2 (amount indicated in each case) with 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1000–1300 dpm/pmol) in buffer PA and 15 μg/ml protein kinase inhibitor amide fragment 6-22, when added. The reactions were incubated 15 min at 30 °C. The incorporation of phosphate into GST-Pyk1 and GST-Pyk2 was determined by scintillation counting of phosphorylated enzyme excised from dried SDS-PAGE gels. Alternatively, SDS-PAGE-dried gels were exposed to autoradiography or subjected to digital imaging analysis (Bio-Imaging Analyzer Bas-1800II and Image Gauge 3.12, Fujifilm). In the experiment in Fig. 4, yeast crude extracts derived from strains1115 and tpk1w1, grown on YPG medium during 16 h at 30 °C, were used as the source of PKA activity. The crude extracts were prepared as described above. Samples of crude extract (100 μg/ml) were mixed with semi-purified GST-Pyk1 or GST-Pyk2 (10–20 μg) in buffer PA plus 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (2200 dpm/pmol) and 10 μmcAMP, when added, in a final volume of 40 μl. After 30 min at 30 °C, aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The total amount of catalytic activity in the crude extract preparations was determined under the standard PKA assay conditions. Samples of crude extract or purified preparations of GST-Pyk1, GST-Pyk2, and GST were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using 25 mmTris, 192 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol buffer in a Transphor apparatus. Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline. Primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1/500 for anti-GST antibody and 1/1000 for anti-pyruvate kinase antibody. Secondary antibodies were used at 1/10,000 (anti-rabbit and anti-goat IgG-peroxidase-conjugated). After three washes the blots were developed with Chemiluminescence Luminol reagent, and immunoreactive bands were visualized by autoradiography and analyzed by digital imaging. Yeast strains EJ758+GST-PYK2, EJ758+GST-PYK1, tpk1w1+GST-PYK2, and tpk1w1+GST-PYK1 were grown in SD-Ura medium during 16 h at 30 °C. The cultures (20 ml) were centrifuged, and the cell pellets were washed with phosphate-free YPD medium, resuspended in the same medium (30 ml), grown until exponential phase (A600 = 0.8), concentrated to 3 ml, and further incubated with 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate. After 2 h the induction of GST fusion protein was performed as described above. The cells were washed with cold saline buffer and disrupted with glass beads in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl plus 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 3 μg/ml antipain, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm NaVO4. 32P uptake was measured and was similar for both wild type and tpk1w1strains. GST-Pyk1 and GST-Pyk2 were purified by glutathione-agarose chromatography and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and analyzed by digital imaging. The pyruvate kinase activity was determined in 50 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.0, containing 62 mm MgCl2 and 100 mm KCl. Under standard conditions, 1.5 mm ADP, 1.5 mm FBP as activator, and different amounts of PEP were used. The reaction was coupled to NADH oxidation by addition of 1 unit of lactate dehydrogenase per milliliter and 0.22 mm NADH. The time course of the reaction was monitored at 30 °C by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. For the determination of kinetic parameters, the pyruvate kinase preparation used came from a partial purification by precipitation from crude extracts with 60% (NH4)2SO4. Pellets were stored at −20 °C and desalted through Sephadex G-25 in imidazole buffer, immediately before the assay. Pyruvate kinase activity is expressed in enzyme units: 1 enzyme unit causes the transphosphorylation of 1 μmol of phosphate from PEP to ADP per minute at 37 °C, under standard assay conditions. Alkaline phosphatase was used to dephosphorylate the endogenous pyruvate kinase (Pyk1) present in crude extracts of strain 1451. The dephosphorylation reactions were performed for 30 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 80 μl. 300 μg of crude Pyk1 preparations, obtained through precipitation with 60% (NH4)2SO4 and desalting, as described above, were incubated with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 50 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, and 100 units of phosphatase alkaline-biotinamidocaproyl. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 150 μl of streptavidin immobilized on iron oxide. The alkaline phosphatase biotinamidocaproyl-streptavidine iron oxide complex was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then magnetically separated for 15 min. The supernatant was used as a source of dephosphorylated enzyme for the measurement of Pyk1 activity. Protein was determined by the Bradford assay (29Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Kinetic data of Pyk phosphorylation by PKA were analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The substrate (Pyk) concentration used in the assays of Fig. 5 was found to be very low. Under these conditions the combination of the substrate with the enzyme becomes rate-limiting, and the Michaelis-Menten equation becomesv = Vmax/Km[S], where S is the substrate concentration. The tangent of the curve at the origin gives the specificity constant valueVmax/Km, which is the more critical parameter in determining the specificity of an enzyme for a substrate. Kinetic analysis of pyruvate kinase activity was performed using Hill equation (Fig. 7). The kcat presented in Fig.7B was calculated normalizing thekcat expressed in units per milligram of total protein in the preparation (units/milligram of protein) to the Pyk relative abundance. This parameter was estimated as a ratio between the immunoreactive band of Pyk in the Western blots relative to total Coomassie Blue-stained protein, quantified by bio-imaging analysis. All experiments were repeated at least twice with independent transformants, cultures, and enzymatic preparations. The results always showed consistent trends, i.e. different transformants and extracts gave highly reproducible results. In all cases, results from representative experiments are shown. To identify possible targets of S. cerevisiae PKA our initial approach was to immunoprecipitate PKA holoenzyme and to further analyze the co-immunoprecipitated proteins. The rationale was to overexpress a tagged Tpk1 protein together with an excess of the regulatory subunit Bcy1 to form a tagged holoenzyme containing Tpk1. Extracts from a strain cotransformed with Ycp50-HATPK1 and Yep51-BCY1 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Controls of immunoprecipitation were done using nonspecific antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed with 0.2 m NaCl and assayed for PKA activity measuring the ratio of activity −/+ cAMP. For anti-HA immunoprecipitates, the ratio was 0.2, indicating a good holoenzyme preparation; no PKA activity was detected in nonspecific immunoprecipitates. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to phosphorylation by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP in the absence or presence of cAMP, finally resolved"
https://openalex.org/W2055828191,The morphogen retinoic acid promotes the formation of primitive endoderm in mouse F9 teratocarcinoma cells as does the stimulation of the Frizzled-1 pathway. We investigated whether the β-catenin/Lef-Tcf-sensitive transcriptional pathway activated by Frizzled-1 plays a role in the retinoic acid-induced pathway to primitive endoderm formation. An analysis of Lef-Tcf-sensitive transcription reveals increased transcription at 1 and 4 h post-treatment with retinoic acid. The stimulation of Lef-Tcf-sensitive transcription as well as the formation of primitive endoderm was accompanied by the stabilization of β-catenin as observed in activation of the Frizzled-1 pathway. Transient transfection of F9 cells with an expression vector harboring a dominant-negative mutant of Tcf4 resulted in the attenuation of both the increase in Lef-Tcf-sensitive transcription and formation of primitive endoderm in response to the morphogen. Clones stably transfected to express the dominant-negative Tcf4 displayed a block in retinoic acid-induced activation of Lef-Tcf-sensitive transcription and primitive endoderm formation. These data reveal the obligate role of the β-catenin/Lef-Tcf transcriptional pathway in the action of the morphogen retinoic acid.
https://openalex.org/W2044750367,"Adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5) is sensitive to both high and low affinity inhibition by Ca2+. This property provides a sensitive feedback mechanism of the Ca2+ entry that is potentiated by cAMP in sources where AC5 is commonly expressed (e.g. myocardium). Remarkably little is known about the molecular mechanism whereby Ca2+inhibits AC5. Because previous studies had showed that Ca2+antagonized the activation of adenylyl cyclase brought about by Mg2+, we have now evaluated the Mg2+-binding domain in the catalytic site as the potential site of the interaction, using a number of mutations of AC5 with impaired Mg2+activation. Mg2+ activation exerted contrasting effects on the high and low affinity Ca2+ inhibition. In both wild type and mutants, activation by Mg2+ decreased the absolute amount of high affinity inhibition without affecting theKi value, whereas the Ki value for low affinity inhibition was decreased. These effects were directly proportional to the sensitivity of the mutants to Mg2+. Parallel changes were noted in the efficacies of Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ in the mutant species, suggesting a simple mutation in a shared domain. Strikingly, forskolin, which activates by a mechanism different from Mg2+, did not modify inhibition by Ca2+. Deletion of the N terminus and the C1b domain of AC5 and a chimera formed with AC2 confirmed that the catalytic domain alone was responsible for high affinity inhibition. We therefore conclude that both low and high affinity inhibition by Ca2+ are exerted on different conformations of the Mg2+-binding sites in the catalytic domain of AC5. Adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5) is sensitive to both high and low affinity inhibition by Ca2+.

The cation stimulates AC11 and AC8 in a calmodulin-dependent manner and inhibits AC5 and AC6 apparently independently of calmodulin (3Cooper D.M.F. Karpen J.W. Fagan K.A. Mons N.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 23-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These effects are mirrored in intact cells when [Ca2+]i is elevated by physiological means. Consequently, this regulation has been proposed to provide a device for harmonizing the activities of cAMP and Ca2+ signaling pathways (1Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). At supramicromolar concentrations, Ca2+ inhibits all adenylyl cyclases. The significance of this latter effect is unknown. Early kinetic analyses of uncharacterized adenylyl cyclase activity had led to the suggestion that this low affinity inhibition of adenylyl cyclases represented competition by Ca2+ for an allosteric Mg2+regulatory site (4Steer M.L. Levitzki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2080-2084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Birnbaumer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 300: 129-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Low affinity inhibition was recently established to be a general property of representatives of various identified adenylyl cyclase (6Guillou J.-L. Nakata H. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35539-35545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Kinetic analyses revealed that for each adenylyl cyclase, the low affinity inhibition could be described as a competition between Ca2+ inhibition and Mg2+ activation. Mg2+ has long been known not only to participate in the substrate (MgATP2−) but also to activate adenylyl cyclase at concentrations beyond those required to maximize the concentration of metal-chelated substrate (7Lin M.C. Salomon Y. Rendell M. Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4246-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic analysis of an adenylyl cyclase catalytic core derived from the AC5 C1a and AC2 C2a 2Adenylyl cyclases are divided into the following domains: N terminus (Nt); first transmembrane cassette (Tm1); the first cytosolic domain (C1), which is separated into C1a, a highly conserved catalytic domain, and C1b, which is less conserved and not involved in catalysis; the second transmembrane cassette (Tm2); and the second cytosolic domain (C2), which is separated into C2a, a highly conserved catalytic domain, and C2b, which is less conserved. The two catalytic domains can be separately expressed and combined to yield a fully functional catalytic unit (31Whisnant R.E. Gilman A.G. Dessauer C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). One site (the “A site”) appears to form a tetrahedral coordination sphere, (with the α-phosphate of ATP, two carboxylate oxygens from two aspartate residues, and a water molecule), whereas the other (the “B site”) forms an octahedral coordination sphere (an oxygen from the same aspartates as in the A site, an unesterified oxygen from each of the α-, β-, and γ-phosphates of ATP, and the backbone carbonyl of Ile397). It appears as though the A site enables the catalysis of the attack by the 3′-hydroxyl of ribose on the α-phosphate. Whether one or the other of these sites corresponds to the allosteric Mg2+ regulatory site suggested by kinetic analyses is not clear. However, this structure furnishes a context in which to ask whether these sites might provide the mechanism whereby Ca2+ exerts some of its effects on adenylyl cyclase. Zimmerman et al. (9Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19650-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) described a number of mutants of AC5 in the immediate vicinity of the catalytic site in which the regulation by Mg2+ was altered. We have used these mutants to determine whether there is a link between Mg2+ regulation and sensitivity to inhibition by Ca2+. Because AC5 is also susceptible to inhibition by submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+, we were also able to address possible interplay between low and high affinity inhibition by Ca2+ in these mutants and the role, if any, played by Mg2+. Our studies showed contrasting effects of Mg2+ activation on the inhibition that was elicited by high and low concentrations of Ca2+ in each of the mutants; activation by Mg2+decreased the absolute amount of high affinity inhibition, without affecting the Ki value, whereas theKi value for low affinity inhibition was decreased. In contrast, activation by forskolin, which acts at a different site than Mg2+, did not modify inhibition by Ca2+. Overall, these results suggest considerable overlap between the site of action of Mg2+ and Ca2+ in the catalytic domain of adenylyl cyclase. To exclude other cytosolic domains of AC5, the N terminus and C1b domain were deleted, and a chimera was made between AC5 and the Ca2+-insensitive AC2. We conclude that both low and high affinity inhibition by Ca2+ reflects direct competition by Ca2+ for the different conformations of the catalytic site of AC5 that are induced by Mg2+.DISCUSSIONThe Ca2+-inhibited adenylyl cyclases, AC5 and AC6 are discretely expressed in a number of tissues where their susceptibility to inhibition by physiological rises in Ca2+ appears to provide a device for acutely balancing the activities of the Ca2+ and cAMP signaling systems. For instance, in cardiac tissue, the Ca2+-inhibitable AC5 and AC6 mediate the actions of the sympathetic nervous system on cardiac contractility (2Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). The susceptibility to inhibition by Ca2+ of these adenylyl cyclases provides a delicate feedback by voltage-gated Ca2+channels on the cAMP signal that modulates their activity (20Cooper D.M.F. Brooker G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 34-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A Ca2+-inhibitable adenylyl cyclase also plays a key role in maintaining endothelial cell permeability. 3Cioffi, D., Moore, T. M., Schaack, J., Creighton, J. R., Cooper, D. M. F., and Stevens, T. (2002) J. Cell. Biol.157, 1267–1278. A number of other physiological examples have been discussed elsewhere on the potential usefulness of the susceptibility to inhibition by Ca2+ of adenylyl cyclases (21Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Fagan K. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, remarkably little is known on the molecular mechanisms whereby inhibition by Ca2+ is mediated.Guillou et al. (6Guillou J.-L. Nakata H. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35539-35545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) showed that both submicromolar and supramicromolar concentrations of Ca2+ antagonized activation of adenylyl cyclase by Mg2+. However, those data could not address the site of action of Ca2+, because, for instance, analogous data are seen with the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase mediated by Gαi, which antagonizes the activity state induced by Gαs with little direct, physical interaction between the binding sites of the two G proteins (22Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Consequently, in the present study we took the approach of looking at conservative amino acid mutations around the catalytic site of AC5, which likely impinged on the ability of key aspartate groups to bind Mg2+, resulting in altered activation by Mg2+. We then used these mutants to determine whether there was an interdependence between Mg2+ activation and inhibition by Ca2+. Indeed, an apparently obligate interdependence was encountered. Low affinity inhibition by Ca2+ was a straightforward direct competitive inhibition between Ca2+and Mg2+ for activation of adenylyl cyclase; higher [Ca2+] could always inhibit Mg2+ activation, and higher [Mg2+] could always overcome Ca2+inhibition. Thus, this process may involve a direct competition between Ca2+ and Mg2+ for the same site on the cyclase,e.g. the A site described from the crystal structure, which promotes nucleophilic attack by the 3′-OH of the ribose on the α-phosphate (see Introduction; Fig. 2). In the case of high affinity inhibition by Ca2+, this inhibition is maximal at minimal degrees of Mg2+ activation, i.e. as activation by Mg2+ increases, the amount of high affinity inhibition by Ca2+ is diminished, whereas the affinity is unaltered. This is a hallmark of noncompetitive inhibition, indicating an allosteric interaction between Mg2+ and Ca2+. The simplest interpretation of these data is that low [Ca2+] induces a different inactive enzyme state. Mg2+ noncompetitively antagonizes this effect by stabilizing an active state. It should be acknowledged in passing that kinetic analysis of complete, complex reactions for which detailed atomic awareness of the component reactions is emerging, provides only an intuitive overview of the process. In the present case, a more detailed kinetic analysis of the interaction between Ca2+and Mg2+ as a function of substrate concentration and an evaluation, for instance, of the potential role of Ca2+ in stabilizing the release of the reaction product, pyrophosphate, could throw further light on the reaction mechanism analogous to the detailed description of P site-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (23Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).The results with the mutated AC5 species establish the intimacy of the interaction between Mg2+ and Ca2+. As stated above, just because Ca2+ antagonizes Mg2+activation, this does not mean that their site of interaction is shared. However, the conservative mutations that perturb Mg2+ binding strongly support the intimacy of this interaction. Indeed, one might argue that if the Ca2+ site was distant from the Mg2+ site, then mutations that decreased the potency of Mg2+ might actuallyincrease the efficacy of Ca2+. The opposite is true. It appears as though the mutations represent a state that would have been induced by higher concentrations of Mg2+, which results in a decreased residual affinity for Mg2+. As a result of the endogenous higher activity state of the mutants, the amount of high affinity inhibition that Ca2+ can induce is already reduced. However, further activation by Mg2+ can still overcome the high affinity inhibition that is expressed, decreasing the relative amount of high versus low affinity inhibition, as occurs in the wild type.The results with the IIa series of cations, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+, show parallel changes in the ability of these cations to induce high and low affinity inhibition as a function of mutagenesis. Thus, in the wild type AC5, which shows prominent high affinity inhibition by Ca2+, inhibition by Sr2+ is clearly discernible. The fact that this latter inhibition is less in magnitude than that of Ca2+correlates with the lower potency of Sr2+ at Ca2+ sites (16Falke J.J. Drake S.K. Hazard A.L. Peersen O.B. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 219-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In the mutants where the overall affinity for Mg2+ is already reduced and, as a result, the amount of high affinity inhibition available to Ca2+ is reduced, unless the Ca2+-binding site had been grossly distorted, it would be expected that Sr2+ would be quite impotent at inducing high affinity inhibition. The parallel loss in inhibitory efficacy of Sr2+ therefore strongly suggests that the mutations induce a simple change in the Mg2+-binding sites, which translates into simple shifts in the potency of the IIa cations.The consequences of the activation induced by forskolin on the inhibitory profile elicited by Ca2+ are enlightening. Unlike with Mg2+, increasing activity by forskolin had absolutely no effect on either the affinity or relative distribution of the inhibitory states induced by Ca2+. This finding clearly demonstrates that it is not the activity states per se that predispose or not toward high affinity inhibition. This result suggests that although equivalent activities can be induced by different effectors (forskolin and Mg2+), these correspond to nonequivalent conformations. Thus, at a fixed [Mg2+], with increasing forskolin, although activity increases, the occupancy (or conformation) of the Mg2+ site(s) does not change and consequently, the inhibitory response to Ca2+ does not change. This result strongly suggests direct competition between Mg2+ and Ca2+ for common ligating oxygen atoms.A recent paper indicating selective inhibitory effects of micromolar [Zn2+] on AC5 and AC6, but not on AC2 (24Klein C. Sunahara R.K. Hudson T.Y. Heyduk T. Howlett A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11859-11865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), prompts some consideration of whether inhibition by Zn2+ might have something to do with the relative sensitivity of AC5 and AC2 to high affinity inhibition by Ca2+. At first glance the inhibition by the two cations appears to occur by fundamentally different mechanisms, because in contrast with the inhibition by Ca2+described in the present study, (i) the inhibition by Zn2+is not affected in the slightest by either Mg2+ or Mn2+ and (ii) preactivation of AC5 by forskolin, for example, counteracts inhibition by Zn2+, again unlike the situation with Ca2+ and forskolin described presently. However, it is conceivable that Zn2+, albeit with lower affinity, could more persistently occupy the site or part of the site(s) that can be occupied by Ca2+. This issue seems worthy of further exploration, particularly given that one of the Mg2+ sites proposed from the crystal structure was actually occupied by Zn2+ (8Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar).Even though the present studies clearly indicate an intimate interdependence between Ca2+ inhibition and Mg2+ activation, does this mean that the metal-binding sites identified in the crystal structure are likely site(s) of the inhibitory action of Ca2+? Binding of Ca2+ in site A, site B, or a combination of these sites could lead to conformational differences that would result in enzymatic inhibition. It is not difficult to imagine that the low affinity Ca2+site is a direct competition for either the A or the B Mg2+-binding site. The ability of the IIa cations to elicit low affinity inhibition could suggest that this is really a Mg2+-binding site involving four ligating atoms, for which the IIa cations compete poorly. On the other hand, although the high affinity site may be a variant of the low affinity site, such that the additional two or more ligating atoms needed to confer high selectivity for Ca2+ are exposed during conformational changes associated with the activation cycle, it seems reasonable to at least consider the possibility that it is located elsewhere. The C1b domain was proposed as the site of high affinity inhibition in a study using truncated forms of the cytosolic domains of AC5 linked by 14 amino acids (25Scholich K. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2915-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A later study using the same constructs contradicted those conclusions (6Guillou J.-L. Nakata H. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35539-35545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we also showed that there was no difference in sensitivity to Ca2+ of co-expressed half molecules of AC5, lacking or not the C1b domain. The present study also showed no loss in Ca2+ sensitivity upon deleting the N terminus from AC5. Finally, the construction of a chimeric construct between AC5 and AC2 at the C1a-C1b boundary retained high affinity Ca2+ inhibition. Therefore, by simple elimination, no cytosolic region of AC5 other than the C1a domain is a viable candidate for mediating high affinity inhibition. 4The formal possibility should not be completely discounted that calmodulin might play a role in mediating these high affinity effects distally from the catalytic site, even though early investigations appeared to exclude a role for calmodulin. For instance, extensive washing of membranes with EGTA and calmodulin antagonists, such as trifluoperazine, failed to diminish the effect (11Boyajian C.L. Garritsen A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4995-5003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Boyajian C.L. Cooper D.M.F. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A number of experimental approaches might be considered in attempting to pinpoint the site of action of Ca2+. Our present and previous data have revealed a tightly knit connection between the Mg2+ and Ca2+ sites in AC5 and AC6. These results identify sites A and B or their immediate vicinity as viable loci for the sites of the inhibitory actions of calcium. Site-directed mutagenesis around the catalytic domain is unlikely to yield further information, because mutations that directly affect Mg2+binding are, not surprisingly, inactive (9Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19650-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, conservative mutations that impinge on the amino acids involved in Mg2+binding (informed by the crystal structures available) might reinforce the present conclusions. The possibility that additional parts of the AC5 sequence might play some role in facilitating Ca2+inhibition could be determined from chimeric constructs between the Ca2+-inhibitable AC5 and the Ca2+-insensitive AC2 along the lines applied in the present study. However, given that the present studies point so strongly toward the C1a domain, new crystal structure analysis between the C1a and C2a from AC5, rather than the C1a from AC5 coupled with the C2a of AC2, as is currently available, might be the most direct means for resolving this issue.A physiological implication of the present findings is that ambient [Mg2+] will dictate the degree to which inhibition by Ca2+ will occur in intact cells. High affinity inhibition by Ca2+ seems to be the only physiological option for inhibiting adenylyl cyclase, because elevations in [Ca2+]i are not considered to exceed 1 μm, 5Although it should be borne in mind that several lines of evidence suggest that Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases are located close to capacitative Ca2+ entry channels (29Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 30Fagan K.A. Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9297-9305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which might allow [Ca2+]i to reach even higher concentrations in the immediate domain of adenylyl cyclase, both forms of inhibition are diminished by elevating [Mg2+] in vitro. and high affinity inhibition is antagonized by high [Mg2+] (present studies). The fact that AC5 and AC6 are seen to be inhibited upon the entry of Ca2+ accords with the in vitrosensitivity observed herein, because cellular [Mg2+] is estimated to be between 0.6 and 1 mm (14Amano T. Matsubara T. Watanabe J. Nakayama S. Hotta N. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Kato H. Gotoh H. Kajikawa M. Suto K. Brain Res. 1998; 779: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, cellular mechanisms that modulated cytosolic [Mg2+] might exert profound influences on how adenylyl cyclases could be inhibited by elevation in [Ca2+]i.In closing, we have developed a clear kinetic picture of how both low and high affinity inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by Ca2+are mediated. The molecular mechanism clearly requires two Ca2+-binding sites, although their precise locations are not known. It seems reasonable to expect that the low affinity site will overlap with the Mg2+-binding sites identified from the crystal structure, whereas high affinity inhibition will be mediated on a distinct conformation, which may overlap with the first site. If it turned out that high affinity inhibition of AC5 directly involved a Mg2+-binding site in the catalytic domain, it would seem reasonable to ask why so-called Ca2+-insensitive adenylyl cyclases, such as AC2 and AC7, do not display high affinity Ca2+ inhibition (see e.g. Ref. 6Guillou J.-L. Nakata H. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35539-35545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), given that the catalytic domains of adenylyl cyclases are highly homologous (up to 65% amino acid identity) and are assumed to be similar in tertiary structure. This latter assumption may be a little simplistic, given the rather divergent basal activities of different adenylyl cyclase species (26Pieroni J.P. Harry A. Chen J. Jacobowitz O. Magnusson R.P. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21368-21373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and therefore, presumably, the conformational transitions associated with catalytic activity. Indeed, it is not difficult to imagine that the Mg2+-binding sites and adjacent amino acids in the catalytic domain of Ca2+-insensitive adenylyl cyclases may just never quite adopt the conformation that allows Ca2+ to bind with high affinity. Detailed, comparative crystallographic analysis seems to be the only unambiguous means for solving this problem. In intact cells, an additional factor conferring sensitivity to elevations in [Ca2+]i is that Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases (AC6 and AC8) need to be localized in caveolae to be regulated by capacitative Ca2+entry (27Fagan K.A.

(Capacitative Ca2+ entry is the mode of elevation of [Ca2+]i that is essential for the regulation of Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases in nonexcitable cells (29Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J.

Therefore, subcellular localization, sensitivity to Mg2+, and quite subtle structural features of the catalytic domain may all contribute to rendering adenylyl cyclases sensitive to [Ca2+]i. Ca2+ in submicromolar concentrations exerts type-specific effects on adenylyl cyclases in in vitroassays (1Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Karpen J.W.

The cation stimulates AC11 and AC8 in a calmodulin-dependent manner and inhibits AC5 and AC6 apparently independently of calmodulin (3Cooper D.M.F. Karpen J.W. Fagan K.A. Mons N.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 23-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These effects are mirrored in intact cells when [Ca2+]i is elevated by physiological means. Consequently, this regulation has been proposed to provide a device for harmonizing the activities of cAMP and Ca2+ signaling pathways (1Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). At supramicromolar concentrations, Ca2+ inhibits all adenylyl cyclases. The significance of this latter effect is unknown. Early kinetic analyses of uncharacterized adenylyl cyclase activity had led to the suggestion that this low affinity inhibition of adenylyl cyclases represented competition by Ca2+ for an allosteric Mg2+regulatory site (4Steer M.L. Levitzki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2080-2084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Birnbaumer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 300: 129-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Low affinity inhibition was recently established to be a general property of representatives of various identified adenylyl cyclase (6Guillou J.-L. Nakata H. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol.

Kinetic analyses revealed that for each adenylyl cyclase, the low affinity inhibition could be described as a competition between Ca2+ inhibition and Mg2+ activation.

In order to study this process, we have used a synthetic compound, MT-21, that is able to initiate release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria. We demonstrate that MT-21 significantly inhibits ADP transport activity in mitochondria and reduces binding of the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) to a phenylarsine oxide affinity matrix. These results suggest that ANT, one of the components of the mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) pore, is the molecular target for MT-21. In agreement with this, the MT-21-induced cytochromec release was effectively inhibited in the presence of ANT ligands, and MT-21 could dissociate ANT from a complex with a glutathione S-transferase-cyclophilin D fusion protein. Interestingly, we also found that specific inhibitors of ANT such as MT-21 and atractyloside could induce cytochrome c release without mitochondrial swelling and that this event was highly dependent on the presence of Mg2+. These results suggest that although ANT resides in the mitochondrial inner membrane, specific ANT inhibitors can induce cytochrome c release without having an effect on inner membrane permeability.

In the beginning of apoptosis, death signals (anti-tumor compounds, superoxide, etc.) induce the release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol (1Li P.

Once cytochrome c, a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is released from mitochondria, it binds to Apaf-1 and promotes the assembly of a multiprotein complex that induces proteolytic processing and activation of the caspase cell death proteases (1Li P.

Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this level of knowledge, the mechanism underlying cytochromec release from mitochondria is not fully understood. One hypothesis is that a mitochondrial protein complex called the permeability transition (PT)1pore mediates cytochrome c release. The components of this pore include the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), cyclophilin D, and kinases such as hexokinase and creatine kinase (5Beutner G. Rück A. Riede B. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Evidence to support this hypothesis has come from the use of low molecular weight compounds such as cyclosporin A and bongkrekic acid that are known to interact with PT pore components and are able to inhibit both the opening of the PT pore and the release of cytochrome c (6Davidson A.M.

ANT is located in mitochondrial inner membrane where it is a specific carrier for ADP and ATP. ANT has two conformational states, c-state and m-state, and ADP/ATP are transported via interconversion of these two states. In c-state a hydrophilic loop of the ANT, which is the nucleotide-binding site, faces toward cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane, and in m-state it is exposed to the matrix side (8Majima E.

Conversely, a different ANT inhibitor, atractyloside, induces PT pore opening and cytochrome c release by changing the ANT conformation to its c-state (12Klingenberg M. J. Bioenerg.

In a previous study, it was shown that overexpression of ANT-1, which is one of the ANT isoforms, induced apoptotic cell death and that this was suppressed by co-expression of cyclophilin D (19Bauer M.K.A. Schubert A. Rocks O. Grimm S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, a molecular interaction between ANT and cyclophilin D may be important for anti-apoptotic functions in mitochondria. Commonly, pro-apoptotic agents cause mitochondrial depolarization, swelling, and rupture of the outer membrane, resulting in the release of proteins from the intermembrane space (13Kantrow S.P.

However, it has been reported that the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, Bax, causes Mg2+-dependent cytochromec release without altering inner membrane permeability and that this event was not inhibited by cyclosporin A (20Eskes R.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Thus, even in a simple assay system using isolated mitochondria, the significance of the PT pore complex in cytochrome c release remains controversial. We reported previously (26Watabe M. Machida K. Osada H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5214-5222PubMed Google Scholar) that a synthetic compound, MT-21, induced apoptotic cell death in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells through induction of cytochrome c release from mitochondria. In this present study, we demonstrate that the molecular target of MT-21 is ANT and that MT-21 specifically inhibits the molecular interaction between ANT and cyclophilin D. We show that specific ANT inhibitors such as MT-21 and atractyloside cause cytochrome c release without mitochondrial swelling, and we therefore propose that modification of ANT, one of the PT pore components, can cause cytochrome c release by a PT-independent mechanism. Monoclonal antibody against cytochromec (clone 7H8.2C12) was purchased from BD PharMingen and polyclonal antibody against ANT (Q-18) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-porin (VDAC) monoclonal antibody (31HL, clone 7) and anti-cyclophilin D polyclonal antibody were fromCalbiochem. Bongkrekic acid and cyclosporin A were purchased fromCalbiochem. Atractyloside and phenylarsine oxide were obtained from Sigma. Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide and α-chymotrypsin were from Peptide Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Mitochondria were isolated from human leukemia HL-60 cells as described previously (27Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse liver mitochondria were purified from male mice by Percoll gradient centrifugation (28Susin S.A. Larochette N. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 205-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria were incubated with MT-21 at 30 °C in PT buffer (10 mm Tris-MOPS, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm succinate, 10 μm EGTA) and centrifuged at 13,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. For detecting cytochrome c released from mitochondria, mitochondrial pellet and supernatant fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE (15%) and Western blot analysis. Mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) were treated with or without MT-21 in PT buffer. After a 30-min incubation, mitochondria were collected by centrifugation and solubilized in 100 μl of HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mmNa2SO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmPMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.25% (v/v) of Triton X-100. Each lysate was incubated with 4-aminophenylarsine oxide agarose (ThioBond Resin, Invitrogen) that had been equilibrated in the identical buffer. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and the resin was washed with equilibration buffer. Proteins bound to the resin were eluted with 50 μl of equilibration buffer that included 10 mmdithiothreitol. Twenty-μl samples of the eluted fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE (15%) followed by Western blot analysis. To measure the mitochondrial swelling that accompanies opening of the permeability transition pore, mitochondria (0.5 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in PT buffer at 30 °C in the presence of either CaCl2 or MgCl2. Changes in A540 following the addition of chemicals were analyzed by a spectrophotometer (22Jürgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). The effect of MT-21 on transport of ADP into mitochondria was assayed as described previously (29Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria (1 mg/ml) were pretreated in PT buffer for 10 min with various concentrations of MT-21. These samples were further incubated for 5 min at 0 °C prior to the addition of 20 μm [14C]ADP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, specific radioactivity, 185 kBq/μmol) and incubated for an additional 20 s at 0 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μm atractyloside. The mitochondrial pellet was solubilized in 0.2 ml of 1% SDS, and the radioactivity of the lysate was determined by liquid scintillation counting (TRICARB 2000, Packard Instrument Co.). Human cyclophilin D was amplified from cDNA of human leukemia HL-60 cells (kindly provided by Dr. S. Simizu). The cyclophilin D gene was amplified using specific primers (5′ primer, 5′-GCGGGATCCATGCTGGCGCTGCGCTG-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-GGCGAATTCTTAGCTCAACTGGCCACAGTC-3′). The matured form of cyclophilin D truncated by its N-terminal 29 amino acids was generated by PCR using specific primers (5′ primer, 5′-GCCGGATCCTGCAGCAAGGGCTCCGGCGA-3′; and 3′ primer, 5′-GGCGAATTCTTAGCTCAACTGGCCACAGTC-3′). The PCR product was subcloned into pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Biosciences) to obtain the N-terminal GST-cyclophilin D fusion. Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) cells transformed with the plasmid were grown in LB broth at 28 °C, and production of the recombinant protein was induced by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropylthio-β-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in buffer A (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF). The soluble fraction was obtained by centrifugation and mixed with GSH-immobilized beads (glutathione-Sepharose 4B, Amersham Biosciences) to allow adsorption of the fusion protein. The affinity matrix was then washed with buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) and used for the binding assay. Peptidylprolyl-cis,trans-isomerase (PPIase) activity was determined using a synthetic peptide, succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide, as a substrate in a two-step reaction coupled to chymotrypsin (30Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P. Kishore V. Colón-Bonilla E. Rich D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6127-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml), pretreated with or without MT-21, were solubilized in 100 μl of HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm Na2SO4, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.25% (v/v) of Triton X-100. Each lysate was centrifuged, and 100 μl of the supernatant was diluted with 100 μl of the HEPES buffer prior to the addition of 20 μl of GST-cyclophilin D affinity matrix (0.5 μg/μl beads) and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. The affinity matrix was washed, and conjugated fusion proteins were eluted by the addition of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 20 mmglutathione. Each elute was subjected to SDS-PAGE (15%) and analyzed by Western blotting. The precise requirement for divalent cations during mitochondrial cytochrome c release has previously been ambiguous. Therefore, we started this investigation by clarifying the effects of Mg2+ and Ca2+ on the induction of cytochrome c release promoted by various concentrations of MT-21. Because CaCl2 at 50 μm induced cytochrome c release in the absence of MT-21 (data not shown), samples were treated with CaCl2 at 20 μm. As shown in Fig.1a, MT-21 did not induce cytochrome c release with this level of CaCl2. MT-21 significantly induced cytochrome c release in the presence of 2.5 mm MgCl2, and this concentration was similar to that shown to enhance Bax-mediated cytochrome c release in previous studies (20Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter Cyclosporin Adoul R. Mazei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 21Kim T.H. Zhao Y. Barber M.J. Kuharsky D.K. Yin X.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39474-39481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). KCl did not enhance the cytochrome c release by MT-21 at concentrations of less than 10 mm (Fig. 1b). Although excess amount of KCl (40 mm) enhanced cytochromec release by MT-21, this concentration was extraordinarily higher than that of MgCl2. Therefore we concluded that the enhancing effect of MgCl2 on the cytochrome crelease by MT-21 was due to the Mg2+ cation rather than the Cl− anion. Similar results were obtained when mouse liver mitochondria were used (data not shown). The VDAC regulates the transport of nonspecific low molecular metabolites across the outer mitochondrial membrane, whereas ANT regulates the transport of adenine nucleotides across the inner membrane. In order to determine whether MT-21 inhibits ANT activity, we investigated if MT-21 affected mitochondrial [14C]ADP transport activity or not. Fig.2a shows that MT-21 significantly inhibited the ADP uptake into mitochondria in a dose-dependent manner. One possible explanation for this observation is that MT-21 affects the ANT conformation thereby inhibiting its adenine nucleotide transport activity. ANT is a carrier protein that is able to form two conformational states, the c-state and the m-state. It has three reactive cysteines (Cys56, Cys159, and Cys256) that are all located on putative matrix-facing loops and whose thiol groups selectively react with thiol reagents when in the m-state (8Majima E.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4807-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Previous study showed that a derivative of atractyloside, carboxyatractyloside, fixes ANT in the c-state and greatly reduces the binding of ANT to phenylarsine oxide (PhAsO)-agarose, an affinity matrix that binds selectively with vicinal dithiols in proteins (15Halestrap A. Woodfield K.Y. Connern C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). In order to estimate whether MT-21 affects the conformational state of ANT, we investigated the effect of MT-21 on the capacity of ANT to bind to the PhAsO affinity matrix. Incubation of mitochondria with MT-21, atractyloside, or PhAsO inhibited binding of ANT to PhAsO matrix in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2b). In contrast to PhAsO that binds to the –SH moieties directly, the effect of MT-21 was abrogated by pretreatment with bongkrekic acid. It is known that bongkrekic acid fixes ANT conformation in the m-state (11Brandolin G., Le Saux A. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J.M. Vignais P.V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, when mitochondria were pretreated with physiological ligands of ANT such as ADP or ATP, the effect of MT-21 was also canceled (data not shown). These observations suggest that MT-21 and atractyloside both inhibit ANT binding through alteration of its conformation rather than by covalent binding to the ANT –SH groups. The effects of the ANT-ligands on the MT-21-induced cytochrome c release were also investigated. MT-21-induced cytochrome c release was partially or completely suppressed by the addition of bongkrekic acid and physiological ligands of the ANT such as ADP and ATP (Fig.2c). These results suggest that the induction of cytochromec release by MT-21 is related to the fixing of ANT in its c-state. Because MT-21 appeared to be acting by altering ANT conformation, it was therefore possible that it would also inhibit the binding between cyclophilin D and ANT. In order to test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of MT-21 on the binding activity of human cyclophilin D with ANT and VDAC. The cyclophilin D cDNA from human leukemia HL-60 was cloned and sequenced and found to be identical to that reported previously (GenBankTM accession numberM80254). It is known that the amino acid residues 1–29 of the rat cyclophilin D function as a mitochondrial targeting sequence and that they are cleaved off during import into mitochondria (31Johnson N. Khan A. Virji S. Ward J.M. Crompton M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, for the binding assay of cyclophilin D to mitochondrial proteins, GST was fused with the mature form of the cyclophilin D protein (amino acids 30–207). The ∼46-kDa GST-cyclophilin D fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified from the soluble fraction using glutathione-Sepharose. Both the fusion protein and the 19-kDa cyclophilin D protein generated by cleavage of GST could be detected with anti-cyclophilin D antibody that recognize the N-terminal region of mature cyclophilin D (Fig.3a). The peptidylprolyl-cis,trans-isomerase (PPIase) activity of the GST-cyclophilin D fusion protein was demonstrated to be similar to that of cyclophilin D purified by a conventional method (32Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) (data not shown). This activity was inhibited by the addition of cyclosporin A, a specific inhibitor of cyclophilin (Fig. 3b). From these observations, it is likely that the enzymatic properties of cyclophilin D were largely preserved in the GST fusion protein. To detect the GST-cyclophilin D-binding proteins, we applied mitochondrial extracts to a cyclophilin D affinity matrix. Bound proteins were eluted by the addition of glutathione, and the eluted material was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-ANT and anti-VDAC antibodies. ANT bound to the affinity matrix but VDAC did not under these conditions (Fig.3c). When the GST-cyclophilin D matrix was pretreated with cyclosporin A in concentrations ranging up to 400 μm, we never observed any inhibitory effects on ANT binding. We next investigated the effect of MT-21 on the association between ANT and cyclophilin D using this bioassay system. When mitochondria were pretreated with inhibitors of ANT such as atractyloside, bongkrekic acid, or MT-21, binding of ANT to the cyclophilin D affinity matrix was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4a). However, MT-21 did not inhibit the PPIase activity of the GST-cyclophilin D fusion protein at concentrations that inhibited ANT binding to GST-cyclophilin D (Fig.4b). To investigate further the conformational change of the ANT by MT-21, the cyclophilin D affinity matrix was preincubated with mitochondrial protein extracts, thus allowing the formation of the ANT·GST-cyclophilin D complex prior to the addition of ANT inhibitors. When the ANT·GST-cyclophilin D complex was subsequently treated with either MT-21 or atractyloside, it was found that both could dissociate the ANT from GST-cyclophilin D matrix effectively (Fig. 4c). In contrast, bongkrekic acid, which is known as an inhibitor of cytochrome c release, did not dissociate the ANT from GST-cyclophilin D matrix. When the PT pore is opened, there is an alteration in the permeability of the inner membrane and the mitochondria become swollen. It is known that atractyloside causes mitochondrial swelling (14Ravagnan L. Marzo I. Costantini P. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Petit P.X. Hirsch F. Goulbern M. Poupon M.F. Miccoli L. Xie Z. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2537-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and we wished to determine whether MT-21 has the same effect. As expected, when mitochondria were incubated in CaCl2-containing buffer, atractyloside induced cytochromec release and mitochondrial swelling in a cyclosporin A-sensitive manner (Fig. 5, aand c). Because bongkrekic acid was able to abrogate the swelling, it is likely that atractyloside induced PT pore opening via a specific interaction with ANT. Interestingly, when mitochondria were incubated in MgCl2-containing buffer, both atractyloside and MT-21 were able to induce cytochrome c release in a cyclosporin A-insensitive manner that was not accompanied with mitochondrial swelling (Fig. 5, b and c). These results indicate that atractyloside can cause both PT-dependent and PT-independent cytochrome crelease, whereas MT-21 induced only PT-independent cytochromec release. We have reported previously that MT-21, a compound having a γ-lactase ring and an alkyl chain (n-C8H17) at N-1 (33Kakeya H. Onozawa C. Sato M. Arai K. Osada H. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), can induce apoptotic cell death via a direct effect on mitochondria (26Watabe M. Machida K. Osada H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5214-5222PubMed Google Scholar). In this present study, we have investigated the mechanism of cytochromec release induced by MT-21 and have identified the target molecule for MT-21 as ANT, one of the PT pore components. The PT pore is believed to play an important role in mitochondrial cytochromec release during apoptosis. Indeed, the PT pore components, ANT and VDAC, have been proposed to be key molecules for regulation of this release (34Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar, 35Shimizu S. Matsuoka Y. Shinohara Y. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 36Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jürgensmeier J. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L.A. Prévost M.-C. Xie Z. Mutsiyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). ANT has six transmembrane helices, and under physiological conditions it regulates adenine nucleotide transport across the inner membrane. Recently, ANT has been regarded as one of the targets for the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein such as Bax (36Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jürgensmeier J. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L.A. Prévost M.-C. Xie Z. Mutsiyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar), and several chemical agents that bind to ANT are known to induce cytochromec release from mitochondria (37Nishikimi A. Kira Y. Kasahara E. Sato E.F. Kanno T. Utsumi K. Inoue M. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 621-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Belzacq A.S. Jacotot E. Vieira H.L.A. Mistro D. Granville D.J. Xie Z. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Brenner C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1260-1264PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclophilin D, a PPIase, is also considered to be a PT pore component, and it has been shown that high Ca2+ or oxidative stress enhances cyclophilin D binding to mitochondrial inner membrane resulting in PT pore opening. These events are prevented by cyclosporin A, a specific cyclophilin inhibitor (15Halestrap A. Woodfield K.Y. Connern C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3346-3354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). However, it has also been reported that ANT tightly binds to GST-cyclophilin D fusion proteins in the absence of Ca2+ and oxidants (39Crompton M. Virji S. Ward J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 40Woodfield K. Rück A. Bradiczka D. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We have shown that cyclosporin A did not inhibit ANT-cyclophilin D binding, a result that is consistent with the initial observation (39Crompton M. Virji S. Ward J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3c). Moreover, when the ANT·VDAC·GST-cyclophilin D protein complex was reconstituted into liposomes, the Ca2+-stimulated pore formation could be observed, and this pore formation was indeed cyclosporin A-sensitive (39Crompton M. Virji S. Ward J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Thus, how cyclophilin D regulates the PT pore conformation remains unclear. A previous study (40Woodfield K. Rück A. Bradiczka D. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) showed that the ANT inhibitors interfered with binding of ANT to GST-cyclophilin D, and we also found that both atractyloside and bongkrekic acid could inhibit the interaction of ANT with a GST-cyclophilin D fusion protein (Fig. 4a). These results may suggest that the molecular interaction between ANT and cyclophilin D is not important for cytochrome c release, because atractyloside is a cytochromec release inducer whereas bongkrekic acid is an inhibitor. However, once the ANT·GST-cyclophilin D protein complex is formed, only the inducers of cytochrome c release, MT-21 and atractyloside, could dissociate ANT from the GST-cyclophilin D fusion protein (Fig. 4c). This observation implies that in intact mitochondria ANT is associated with cyclophilin D and forms part of PT pore complex. Thus, the ANT/cyclophilin D binding may indeed be important for regulation of cytochrome c release. It was reported that Bax, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, is able to interact with VDAC (34Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar, 35Shimizu S. Matsuoka Y. Shinohara Y. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and ANT (36Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jürgensmeier J. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L.A. Prévost M.-C. Xie Z. Mutsiyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar) and that Bax induces cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria in vitro. However, there are controversial papers on Bax-induced cytochrome c release. Some papers showed that Bax-induced cytochrome c release was promoted by Mg2+, and it was PT-independent (20Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter Cyclosporin Adoul R. Mazei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 21Kim T.H. Zhao Y.

In contrast, other papers have reported that Bax-induced cytochrome c release occurs in a cyclosporin A-sensitive manner (23Pastorino J.G. Chen S.-T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 24Tafani M. Karpinich N.O. Hurster K.A. Pastorino J.G. Schneider T. Russo M.A. Farber J.L. J. Biol.

Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31734-31739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). A recent study (41Madesh M. Hajnóczky G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) has shown that superoxide is able to induce cytochrome c release without mitochondrial swelling and that this event is not inhibited by cyclosporin A. It still remains controversial whether the PT pore participates in cytochrome c release or not. Because ANT resides in the inner membrane of mitochondria, it was considered that pro-apoptotic factors that affect the ANT should induce an alteration in inner membrane permeability and result in mitochondrial swelling followed by outer membrane rupture (25Petit P.X. Goubern M. Diolez P. Susiin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Therefore, apoptogenic stimulators that cause PT-independent cytochromec release were considered to interact with VDAC because this resides in the outer membrane. Our present study demonstrates that specific inhibitors of ANT such as MT-21 and atractyloside can induce cytochrome c release by a PT-independent mechanism (Fig. 5, b and c). Thus, we propose that modification of the ANT, a PT pore component in the mitochondrial inner membrane, can result in PT-independent cytochrome c release. As for Bax, this type of cytochrome c release is thought to be highly dependent on the presence of Mg2+ cations. It has been suggested that divalent cations such as Mg2+ and Ca2+ bind VDAC or ANT and affect their conformation (42Gincel D. Zaid H. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a possibility that these cations themselves cause a conformational change in the PT pore complex. Recently, it was reported that hexokinase interacts with ANT by a direct or indirect mechanism (43Hashimoto M. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and associates with VDAC, regulating BAX-mediated cytochromec release (44Pastorino J.G. Shulga N. Hoek J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7610-7618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Consequently, studies that focus only on VDAC or ANT may not be sufficient to explain the mechanism of induction of cytochrome c release. It will be necessary to consider molecular interactions of each PT pore component and the conformational changes of the entire PT pore complex in order to precisely define the molecular events underlying release of cytochrome c. Because superoxide induced release of cytochrome c without a major change of mitochondrial structure in intact cell (41Madesh M. Hajnóczky G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), a PT-independent cytochrome c release is considered to be important. A compound that specifically induces a PT-independent cytochromec release is required. MT-21 did not induce Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial swelling, which is different from atractyloside. Therefore, MT-21 should prove to be a useful tool in understanding the mechanism of PT-independent cytochromec release. We thank Dr. S. Simizu for the generous gift of cDNA from human leukemia cells and Dr. M. Maruyama for providing mice organs. We thank Drs. H. Kakeya, T. Sudo, N. Watanabe, and T. Usui for their helpful comments."
https://openalex.org/W2057029395,"Cardiac G protein-coupled receptors that function through stimulatory G protein Gαs, such as β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors (β1ARs and β2ARs), play a key role in cardiac contractility. Recent data indicate that several Gαs-coupled receptors in heart also activate Gαi, including β2ARs (but not β1ARs). Coupling of cardiac β2ARs to Gαi inhibits adenylyl cyclase and opposes β1AR-mediated apoptosis. Dual coupling of β2AR to both Gαs and Gαi is likely to alter β2AR function in disease, such as congestive heart failure in which Gαi levels are increased. Indeed, heart failure is characterized by reduced responsiveness of βARs. Cardiac βAR-responsiveness is also decreased with aging. However, whether age increases cardiac Gαi has been controversial, with some studies reporting an increase and others reporting no change. The present study examines Gαi in left ventricular membranes from young and old Fisher 344 rats by employing a comprehensive battery of biochemical assays. Immunoblotting reveals significant increases with age in left ventricular Gαi2, but no changes in Gαi3, Gαo, Gαs, Gβ1, or Gβ2. Aging also increases ADP-ribosylation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Consistent with these results, basal as well as receptor-mediated incorporation of photoaffinity label [32P]azidoanilido-GTP indicates higher amounts of Gαi2 in older left ventricular membranes. Moreover, both basal and receptor-mediated adenylyl cyclase activities are lower in left ventricular membranes from older rats, and disabling of Gαi with pertussis toxin increases both basal and receptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Finally, age produces small but significant increases in muscarinic potency for the inhibition of both β1AR- and β2AR-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. The present study establishes that Gαi2 increases with age and provides data indicating that this increase dampens adenylyl cyclase activity.

Activation of AC increases the formation of cAMP, which activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase A resulting in the phosphorylation of proteins controlling cardiac excitation-contraction (1Opie L.H.

The age-induced decrease in βAR responsiveness is characterized at the molecular level by decreased stimulation of AC and at the whole organ level by a decrease in heart rate, ejection fraction, and cardiac output.There have been conflicting reports about the effect of age on cardiac Gαi levels in both humans and rodents. In one study of human heart, Gαi levels were measured in atrial appendages received from surgical patients, and it was found that Gαi expression increased with age (17Brodde O.E. Zerkowski H.R.

Another study examined Gαi expression in human ventricles from hearts that were not suitable for transplant and found no change in Gαi with age (16White M. Roden R. Minobe W. Khan M.F. Larrabee P.

Physiol. 1993; 264: H805-H814PubMed Google Scholar) found that age increases cardiac Gαi, and the increase in Gαi is reduced by exercise. In Wistar rats, Bazan et al. (25Bazan A. van de Velde E. Fraeyman N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) reported an increase in cardiac Gαi with age, but Xiao et al. (6Xiao R.P. Tomhave E.D. Wang D.J., Ji, X. Boluyt M.O. Cheng H. Lakatta E.G. Koch W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and Miyamoto et al. (26Miyamoto A. Kawana S. Kimura H. Ohshika H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 266: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) found no change. Some of the reported differences on the effect of age may be attributable to experimental design. For example, the finding of Chin et al.(24Chin J.H. Hiremath A.N. Hoffman B.B. Mech. Ageing. Dev. 1996; 86: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that age does not increase cardiac Gαi in Fisher 344 rats may be explained by the fact that these investigators used 16-month-old rats for their old age group versus24-month-old rats used by others. Moreover, most studies examined Gαi expression by immunoblotting only, and different Gαi antibodies were used. Nevertheless, the available evidence favors an increase in Gαi with age, as indicated by the recent review of Roka et al. (27Roka F. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, two recent reviews by Lakatta (28Lakatta E.G. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1999; 47: 613-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29Lakatta E.G. Am. J. Geriatr. Cardiol. 2000; 9: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) on global changes in cardiovascular aging state that Gαi in heart does not increase with age. We believe that this conclusion is premature.The importance of Gαi in cardiac function underscores the need to establish whether or not cardiac Gαi is affected with age. Therefore, we undertook a detailed study on the effect of age on Gαi expression in rat ventricular membranes. We used Fisher 344 rats because these rats have been the most widely used rat strain for aging studies (30Weindruch R. Masoro E.J. J. Gerontol. 1991; 46: B87-B88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and age-induced changes in cardiac structure have been characterized (31Anversa P. Palackal T. Sonnenblick E.H. Olivetti G. Meggs L.G. Capasso J.M. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Expression of the predominant cardiac subtypes of Gαi, as well as of Gαs, Gαo, and the major subtypes of Gβ, was assessed by immunoblotting. Levels of PTX-sensitive Gαi/Gαo proteins were also examined by radiolabeling through PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. In addition, Gαi2 activity was assessed using photoaffinity labeling with [32P]azidoanilido-GTP (AA-[32P]GTP). We show age-dependent increases in both Gαi2expression levels and activation of Gαi2 by β2AR and other G protein-coupled receptors in heart. The age-induced increase in Gαi2 has the functional effect of suppressing AC activity, which is restored by disrupting receptor-Gαi coupling with PTX.DISCUSSIONThe main finding of the present study is that Gαi2expression in rat left ventricle increases with age. The increase in Gαi2 expression is demonstrated using several biochemical techniques including immunoblotting, ADP-ribosylation, and photoaffinity labeling with AA-[32P]GTP. The increase in Gαi2 results in enhanced coupling to Gαs-coupled receptors such as β2ARs and glucagon receptors, as well as to Gαi-coupled muscarinic receptors. Thus, the net effect of the increase in Gαi2expression with age is an increase in Gαi2 signaling. This results in reductions in both basal and receptor-mediated AC activities in aged heart, both of which are restored by disabling of Gαi with PTX.The present study examined the effect of age on cardiac Gαi, an important issue about which conflicting data exist in the literature. Determination of the effects of age on Gαi has become increasingly important in light of the recent demonstrations that many cardiac Gαs-coupled receptors, including β2AR, also couple to Gαi (2Xiao R.P., Ji, X. Lakatta E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 3Xiao R.P. Avdonin P. Zhou Y.Y. Cheng H. Akhter S.A. Eschenhagen T. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Lakatta E.G.

Schwinn D.A. Kwatra M.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The data in the present study clearly indicate an increased level of Gαi2 in old Fisher 344 rats, and importantly, also demonstrate an elevation in the receptor-stimulated activation of Gαi2. Prior studies in rats had not provided a consensus as to the effects of age on cardiac Gαi. There have been reports of increased Gαi expression in Fisher 344 (21Roth D.A. White C.D. Podolin D.A. Mazzeo R.S. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), Sprague-Dawley (19Bohm M. Dorner H. Htun P. Lensche H. Platt D. Erdmann E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H805-H814PubMed Google Scholar) and Wistar rats (25Bazan A. van de Velde E. Fraeyman N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), as well as an increase in Fisher 344 Gαi mRNA (22Johnson M.D. Zhou Y. Friedman E. Roberts J. J. Gerontol. A. Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 1995; 50A: B14-B19Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, there also have been reports of no change in Gαi expression in Fisher 344 (22Johnson M.D. Zhou Y. Friedman E. Roberts J. J. Gerontol. A. Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 1995; 50A: B14-B19Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Shu Y. Scarpace P.J. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1994; 23: 188-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Wistar rats (6Xiao R.P. Tomhave E.D. Wang D.J., Ji, X. Boluyt M.O. Cheng H. Lakatta E.G. Koch W.J. J. Clin.

These differences make it necessary to examine Gαi by multiple biochemical approaches. Our data indicating Gαi2 increases in immunoblotting, ADP-ribosylation and photoaffinity labeling lead us to conclude that there is a significant age-dependent elevation in Fisher 344 cardiac Gαi2. The increase in Gαi2 in aged hearts is likely not due to hypertrophy because in Fisher 344 rats hypertrophy is seen at senescence, which occurs at 27–30 months of age (31Anversa P. Palackal T. Sonnenblick E.H. Olivetti G. Meggs L.G. Capasso J.M. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar).In agreement with previous reports in both human (15Kelly J. O'Malley K.

Tumer N. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 77: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we also demonstrate decreases in AC activity in old heart. To explain this phenomenon, some studies have implicated changes at the level of AC. There has been a report of a decrease in the number of forskolin binding sites in old rats (23Shu Y. Scarpace P.J. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1994; 23: 188-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating a lower amount of AC in old tissue, though there have been no reports on AC mRNA levels in Fisher 344 rats. Although decreases in AC activity with age could be due to decreased amounts of AC or its targets, the fact that PTX treatment restores β2AR- and glucagon receptor-stimulated AC signals in older hearts to the levels in younger hearts indicates that PTX-sensitive proteins are responsible for the decreased receptor-stimulated enzyme activity. PTX treatment in both guinea pig heart and rat bladder results in similar reversals of age-induced decreases in AC (20Ferrara N. Bohm M. Zolk O. O'Gara P. Harding S.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 52Derweesh I.H. Wheeler M.A. Weiss R.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 969-974PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that elevated Gαi is the main cause of reduced AC activity in aged rat left ventricles.Apparently, an increase in cardiac Gαi in aged rat heart does not affect βAR-mediated contractility. Although coupling of β1ARs to stimulation of AC and contractility through Gαs is widely accepted, questions remain as to whether effects on contractility through β2AR involve cAMP. In humans, stimulation of contractility via β2ARs has been reported to occur through a cAMP-dependent mechanism that results in protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of phospholamban, troponin I, and C-protein, as well as enhancement of both inotropy and lusitropy, in both non-failing (53Kaumann A.J. Sanders L. Lynham J.A. Bartel S. Kuschel M. Karczewski P. Krause E.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 163/164: 113-123Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and failing human heart (54Kaumann A. Bartel S. Molenaar P. Sanders L. Burrell K. Vetter D. Hempel P. Karczewski P. Krause E.G. Circulation. 1999; 99: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), as well as in non-failing myocardium from infants with Fallot tetralogy (55Molenaar P. Bartel S. Cochrane A. Vetter D. Jalali H. Pohlner P. Burrell K. Karczewski P. Krause E.G. Kaumann A. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, one would expect that in humans, an increase in the coupling of β2AR to Gαi would lower contractility. In contrast, cAMP-independent pathways control β2AR-mediated contractility in rat (2Xiao R.P., Ji, X. Lakatta E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 56Xiao R.P. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 286-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 57Xiao R.P. Hohl C.

Thus, in these species, an age-induced increase in Gαi would not decrease β2AR-mediated contractility. Consistent with this notion is the finding of Jain et al. (62Jain M. Lim C.C. Nagata K. Davis V.M. Milstone D.S. Liao R. Mortensen R.M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 280: H569-H575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who found no difference in basal contractile and relaxation function in mice lacking either Gαi2 or Gαi3.An important functional consequence of an age-induced increase in the coupling of cardiac β2AR to Gαi2 may be increased inhibition of apoptosis. It was shown recently that norepinephrine, acting through a Gαs pathway, increases cardiac apoptosis (63Communal C. Singh K. Pimentel D.R. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 64Gu C., Ma, Y.C. Benjamin J. Littman D. Chao M.V. Huang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20726-20733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). More recent data indicate that β1ARs cause apoptosis, whereas β2ARs acting through a Gαi pathway oppose apoptosis (7Communal C. Singh K. Sawyer D.B. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2210-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 8Chesley A. Lundberg M.S. Asai T. Xiao R.P. Ohtani S. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circ.

A. 2001; 98: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In adult rat ventricular myocytes, stimulation of a PTX-sensitive Gαi-coupled pathway by β2AR inhibits the number of apoptotic cells as measured by flow cytometry (7Communal C. Singh K. Sawyer D.B. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2210-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Using a neonatal rat myocyte model, it was shown that β2AR/Gαi-mediated protection from apoptosis occurs through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and Akt/protein kinase B pathways (8Chesley A. Lundberg M.S. Asai T. Xiao R.P. Ohtani S. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The β2AR/Gαi/PI 3-kinase signaling mechanism also has been shown to mediate the stimulation of NO production (65Wang Y.G. Dedkova E.N. Steinberg S.F. Blatter L.A. Lipsius S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a key mechanism in the cardioprotection conferred by ischemic preconditioning (66Ping P. Takano H. Zhang J. Tang X.L. Qiu Y., Li, R.C. Banerjee S. Dawn B. Balafonova Z. Bolli R. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 587-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Finally, β2AR- mediated protection from apoptosis recently has been reported to occur through a Gαi-dependent stimulation of p38 kinase (67Communal C. Colucci W.S. Singh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19395-19400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), though another study reports that β2AR activates p38 kinase through a protein kinase A-dependent pathway that does not involve Gαi (68Zheng M.

Thus, although the downstream signaling molecules involved have yet to be fully elucidated, an increase in cardiac Gαi seen in aging or failing heart may be an adaptive mechanism to protect the heart from apoptosis, because apoptosis has been shown to occur in both aged (69Olivetti G.

Med. 1997; 336: 1131-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar).In summary, the present study provides evidence that age increases Gαi2 in older rat ventricles, and this results in more activated Gαi2 upon stimulation of various GPCRs. Cardiac contractility is controlled by several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),1 such as β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors (β1ARs and β2ARs), that function through stimulatory GTP-binding regulatory proteins (Gαs) and activate adenylyl cyclase (AC). Activation of AC increases the formation of cAMP, which activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase A resulting in the phosphorylation of proteins controlling cardiac excitation-contraction (1Opie L.H. The Heart: Physiology, from Cell to Circulation. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1998: 173-204Google Scholar). An important recent discovery is that β2ARs (but not β1ARs) in both rat (2Xiao R.P., Ji, X. Lakatta E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar,3Xiao R.P.

Med. 1995; 332: 186-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that Gαicouples to several other Gαs-coupled receptors in human heart, including receptors for histamine, glucagon, and serotonin (4Kilts J.D.

Res. 2000; 87: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Coupling of β2AR and other Gαs-coupled receptors to Gαi is relevant to cardiac function because inactivation of Gαi by pertussis toxin (PTX) increases myocyte contractility in rat heart (6Xiao R.P. Tomhave E.D. Wang D.J., Ji, X. Boluyt M.O. Cheng H. Lakatta E.G. Koch W.J. J. Clin.

https://openalex.org/W2086335863,"The dioxin receptor is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates the biological effects of dioxin and related environmental pollutants. In the absence of ligand the receptor is present in the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell associated with the hsp90-dependent chaperone complex. This complex regulates several functions of the receptor such as ligand binding and nuclear import. Furthermore, intracellular localization of the receptor is modulated by multiple factors such as the export protein CRM-1 and the hsp90-associated immunophilin XAP-2. We have identified the mechanism of XAP-2-induced cytoplasmic localization of the receptor and studied the potential cross-talk between CRM-1 and XAP-2. We show that XAP-2 anchors the ligand-free receptor to cytoskeletal structures. This effect is blocked upon treatment with the actin inhibitor cytochalasin B, whereas the tubulin inhibitor colchicine had no effect on receptor localization. In addition, we show that the receptor interacts with CRM-1 both in the presence and absence of ligand. CRM-1-mediated nuclear export occurs independently of XAP-2. Our data provide evidence that CRM-1 and XAP-2 act in parallel through different mechanisms and target different interfaces of the receptor. These results suggest that two pathways cooperate to localize the non-activated receptor in the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell."

Cas phosphorylation required the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton but was not dependent on cell adhesion, implying that Cas-dependent signaling may be distinct from integrin signaling. TGF-β1 also stimulated Src kinase activity, and specific inhibitors of Src completely blocked the induction of Cas phosphorylation by TGF-β1. The Cas phosphorylation and Src kinase activation seen in our results were induced in an epithelial phenotype-specific manner. Stable transfection of E-cadherin to L929 cells and L cells as well as E-cadherin blocking assay revealed that E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell interactions were essential for both Cas phosphorylation and Src kinase activation.

However, accumulating data indicate that TGF-β can positively affect tumorigenesis and contribute to the progression and invasiveness of tumors (9Cui W. Fowlis D.J. Bryson S. Duffie E. Ireland H.

This tumor-activating activity of TGF-β is associated with its ability to induce an epithelial to mesenchymal transition and stimulate cell migration (12Birchmeier W. Behrens J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The epithelial to mesenchymal transition induced by TGF-β results in the disruption of the polarized morphology of epithelial cells, the formation of stress fibers, and an enhancement of cell migration (11Oft M.

The cell migration and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton induced by many extracellular factors are accompanied by dramatic changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation of several signaling proteins localized at the focal adhesion plaques (16Rozengurt E. Cancer Surv. 1995; 24: 81-96PubMed Google Scholar, 17Rozengurt E. Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Essays Biochem. 1997; 32: 73-86PubMed Google Scholar). The rapid increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the adaptor proteins Cas (Crk-associated substrate) and paxillin has been identified as a prominent early event in cells stimulated by several signaling molecules that regulate cell growth, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis (18Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 19Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Cas initially identified as a highly phosphorylated protein of 130 kDa in v-Src and v-Crk transformed cells (20Kanner S.B.

Science. 1990; 248: 1537-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Cas contains an N-terminal SH3 domain followed by a stretch of proline-rich sequences, a central substrate domain composed of a cluster of potential SH2-binding sites, and a C-terminal domain, which contains consensus binding sites for the SH3 and SH2 domains of c-Src (22Sakai R.

The N-terminal SH3 domain mediates the interaction of Cas with several proteins, including FAK, related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase/PYK2, and FAK-related nonkinases (24Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25673-25679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Following tyrosine phosphorylation, the central substrate domain of Cas interacts with a number of SH2-containing signaling molecules, such as the adapter proteins Crk and Nck, possibly recruiting these molecules to focal adhesions (29Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). All of these structural features indicate that Cas is a docking molecule that can assemble and transmit cellular signals through SH2 and SH3 containing intracellular proteins. Recently, Cas has been shown to be essential for cell migration (31Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J.

Martin G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6953-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, Src and Cas mediate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation (36Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), which is regulated through Cas-Crk complex (37Dolfi F.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3437-3446Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Protein-tyrosine kinases of the Src family play pivotal roles in various signal transduction processes that contribute to the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and cell migration (39Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that intrinsic Src kinase activity is required for the mitogenic and migratory effects of various growth factors (39Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

TGF-β1 induces degradation of activated Src tyrosine kinase in v-Src transformed rat fibroblasts (41Fukuda K. Kawata S. Tamura S. Matsuda Y. Inui Y. Igura T. Inoue S. Kudara T. Matsuzawa Y. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3349-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and decreases Src kinase activity in HepG2 carcinoma cells, whereas it increases its activity and protein levels in Mahlavu hepatoma cells (42Fukuda K. Kawata S. Tamura S. Matsuda Y. Inui Y. Igura T. Inoue S. Kudara T. Matsuzawa Y. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 796-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In human prostatic carcinoma cell line PC3, TGF-β1 was reported to down-regulate Src tyrosine kinases (43Atfi A. Drobetsky E. Boissonneault M. Chapdelaine A. Chevalier S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30688-30693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a role for TGF-β in the regulation of Src kinase activity is not currently well defined. Although Smad proteins are considered important mediators in the regulation of target gene expression induced by TGF-β, Smad-independent signaling involving extracellular signal-regulated kinase (44Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 45Zavadil J. Bitzer M. Liang D. Yang Y.C. Massimi A. Kneitz S. Piek E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37413-37420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) pathways in epithelial cells has been demonstrated. Because there is a similarity among TGF-β, Src, and Cas signaling that mediate the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton, stimulation of cell migration, and JNK activation, we hypothesized that TGF-β would stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas and Src kinase activity. In recent reports, treatment with TGF-β for 48 h was shown to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion molecules in normal murine mammary epithelial cells (48Nakamura K. Yano H. Uchida H. Hashimoto S. Schaefer E. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27155-27164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rabbit corneal keratinocyte (49Jester J.V. Huang J. Barry-Lane P.A. Kao W.W. Petroll W.M. Cavanagh H.D. Invest Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 1959-1967PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism responsible for Cas phosphorylation in TGF-β signaling remains unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that TGF-β induces a rapid and transient increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas in an epithelial cell-specific manner and promotes rapid formation of complexes among focal adhesion molecules. TGF-β also activates Src kinase activity, which is essential for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas. E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell interactions and the intact actin cytoskeleton in epithelial cells are required for this event. TGF-β1 was obtained from PeproTech. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated and rhodamin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, and anti-rabbit IgG, normal mouse IgG, rabbit muscle enolase, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were from Sigma. PP2 and cytochalasin D were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Ltd. Cas (C-20), c-Src (SRC2), and FAK (C-20) polyclonal antibodies (pAbs), protein G-agarose, and ECL reagent were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. E-cadherin (C20820), Cas, paxillin, c-CrkII, and phosphotyrosine (PY20) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were from Transduction Laboratories. Monoclonal anti-human E-cadherin IgG (HECD-1) was obtained from Zymed Laboratories, Inc., and monoclonal anti-FAK (2A7) and anti-Src (GD11) antibodies and the Src kinase assay kit were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The dual luciferase reporter assay system was from Promega. All of the culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen, and the other reagents used were of the purest grade available. Human embryonic kidney epithelial cells (HEK293), human keratinocytes (HaCaT), and mouse fibroblasts (L929 cells, NIH3T3, and Swiss3T3) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The original L cell strain and ELβ1 cells overexpressing mouse E-cadherin (50Nose A. Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Cell. 1988; 54: 993-1001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. M. Takeichi (Kyoto University). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells, L cells, and ELβ1 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Eagle's salts containing 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% FBS. Mouse E-cadherin inserted into the plasmid pIBI76 was kindly provided by Dr. M. Takeichi. The E-cadherin fragment was reisolated by double digestion with AatI and EcoRV and inserted into the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3 (pcDNA3-Ecad). Transfections of pcDNA3-Ecad and control vector pcDNA3 into L cell derivatives (L929 cells) were performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were selected in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 in a humidified atmosphere comprising 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C for about 2 weeks. Then the G418-resistant colonies were isolated, screened for E-cadherin expression by immunofluorescence staining using anti-mouse E-cadherin antibody, as described below, and maintained under the above conditions. For luciferase assays, the cells were transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE. Typically, 2 × 105 cells were plated in each well of a 6-well plate. The next day, the cells were transfected with 1 μg/well of 3TP-Lux (kindly gifted by Dr. Joan Massagué) along with 0.2 μg/well SV40-RL (Promega) as an internal control for transfection efficiency. After 18 h, the medium was changed, and TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) was added for an additional 24 h. The cells were then lysed, and luciferase activity was determined using the Promega dual luciferase reporter assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. For TGF-β1 stimulation, subconfluent cells were serum-starved for 36 h in serum-free medium. They were washed once with serum-free medium, treated with TGF-β1 as indicated, and then lysed as described below. In some experiments, serum-starved cells were pretreated with various concentrations of cytochalasin D or PP2 for 2 h and 15 min, respectively, before TGF-β1 stimulation. To block cell-cell interaction, subconfluent HaCaT cells grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS were washed twice with serum-free medium and then treated with 25 μg/ml HECD-1 or control mouse IgG for 18 h, followed by TGF-β1 stimulation. For Western blotting analysis following immunoprecipitation using anti-Cas, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in (1 ml/100-mm plate) modified RIPA lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) on ice. For immunoprecipitation of Cas, FAK, paxillin, c-CrkII, and c-Src using monoclonal antibodies, the cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (deoxycholate and SDS detergents was omitted from RIPA buffer). The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and was incubated for overnight at 4 °C with indicated antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were collected with protein G-agarose (for mAbs) or protein A-Sepharose (for pAbs) for 2 h. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and 10% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h and were incubated for overnight at 4 °C with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY20 (1:2000), anti-Src pAb SRC2 (1:2000), anti-FAK pAb (1:2000), anti-paxillin mAb (1:5000), anti-Crk mAb (1:2000), or anti-Cas pAb (1:3000). Following washing with TBST, antibody binding was detected using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG and visualized with ECL chemiluminescence reaction reagents. For reprobing with other antibodies, the antibody bound on blots was removed with a stripping buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 60 °C for 60 min. After washing three times with TBST, the blots were blocked and reprobed with the indicated antibody. Cell monolayers grown to 98% confluence were washed with calcium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution and detached by incubating in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm EGTA for 15 min at 37 °C. Cell viability as assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion was greater than 95%. The detached cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were washed twice and resuspended with 800 μl/tube of DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 100 μg/ml DNase. After incubation for 60 min (referred to as 0 min) at 37 °C with continuous rotating at 20 rpm, the cells were then treated with TGF-β for the indicated times, dipped into ice, centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and washed twice with stop buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF). In some experiments to block cell-cell adhesion, 50 μg/ml HECD-1 or control antibodies were added for 60 min to the cells suspended for 60 min, followed by TGF-β treatment for another 5 min. Cell solubilization and immunoprecipitation of lysates were performed as described above. Aggregation assays were performed at 37 °C at 100 rpm for the indicated times in triplicate wells, in 24-well ultra low attachment plates (Corning Costar Cooperation, Cambridge, MA). The assays were stopped after 0 and 60 min by fixing the cells in 1% glutaraldehyde. The extent of cell-cell binding was monitored by measuring the disappearance of single cells using a Coulter counter. The standard deviations of the mean values are included. Tyrosine kinase activity of Src was assayed by immunoprecipitation using GD11 as described above. The immunoprecipitates from ∼500 μg of total protein were washed three times with Triton X-100 lysis buffer, and the reactions were carried out using components of a commercially available Src kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). The assay is based on Src-dependent phosphorylation of a substrate peptide (KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK) derived from p34cdc2. In some experiments to measure Src kinase activity using acid-denatured enolase as a substrate, immunoprecipitates were washed twice with HNTG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated with HNTG buffer plus 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 4 μg/reaction enolase for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 4× sample buffer and boiling and was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The presence of equivalent amounts of enolase was verified by Coomassie staining of the gel and equivalent amounts of Src by immunoblotting. The labeled enolase was visualized by autoradiography. HaCaT, E-cadherin transfected L929 cells (L9E12), and control vector transfected cells (L9M3) were grown on Lab-Tek chambered glass slides (Nunc). After 24 h, the cells grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS were serum-starved for 18 h in the absence or presence of 25 μg/ml HECD-1 or control mouse IgG. The cells were then fixed in freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at room temperature for 15 min, incubated with 100 mm glycine in PBS for 20 min to block aldehydes, rinsed three times for 10 min in 0.5 mm glycine/PBS, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm glycine/PBS for 10 min, rinsed three times for 10 min in 0.5 mm glycine/PBS, and blocked in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. For E-cadherin staining, the cells were incubated with anti-mouse E-cadherin (C20820) in blocking buffer for overnight at 4 °C. As secondary antibodies, FITC-conjugated or rhodamin-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies were used. Finally, the cells were washed, mounted in anti-fade medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and examined by a conventional inverted fluorescence microscopy (model S 100; Carl Zeiss, Inc., Oberkochen, Germany), and the captured images were processed by Adobe Photoshop. To investigate whether TGF-β1 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas in HEK293 cells, serum-starved cells were stimulated with various concentrations of TGF-β1 for 10 min and lysed, and the extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cas antibody. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (PY20). As shown in Fig.1A, TGF-β1 induced a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas following a bell-shaped dose-response relationship with maximum effect at 1–3 ng/ml. At a higher concentration (5 ng/ml) of TGF-β1, tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas was nearly at the base-line level. The kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas stimulated by TGF-β1 in HEK293 is shown in Fig. 1B. An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas could be detected as early as 2 min after treatment with 2 ng/ml TGF-β1, reaching a maximum after 5–10 min. Subsequently, tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas declined gradually to almost base-line levels. TGF-β1 also induced a rapid and transient increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and the adaptor protein paxillin. The increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was dose-dependent (Fig. 1C) and could be detected as early as 2 min after addition of 2 ng/ml TGF-β1, peaking at 5 min (Fig. 1D). In the event of paxillin, the maximal increase was reached at 10 min (Fig.1E). Cas contains a tyrosine kinase substrate domain consisting of 15 potential SH2-binding motifs, nine of which conform to the SH2-binding motif for Crk (22Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), and cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins promotes FAK and c-Src kinase activity leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas and its association with Crk or Nck (29Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 150 amino acids (focal adhesion targeting sequence) of FAK contain binding sites for paxillin, and the major site of FAK autophosphorylation, tyrosine 397, is potentially a high affinity binding site for the SH2 domain of Src (18Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined whether TGF-β1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these focal adhesion molecules could lead to the formation of complexes among the focal adhesion molecules Cas, Crk, FAK, and paxillin in HEK293 cells. The immunoprecipitates of Crk and FAK were analyzed by immunoblotting probed with anti-Cas and anti-paxillin antibodies, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, TGF-β1 induced the rapid and transient formation of Crk/Cas (Fig. 2A) and FAK/paxillin (Fig. 2B) complexes that were time-dependent and parallel to the TGF-β1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these molecules. The formation of these complexes reached a maximum after 5–10 min of TGF-β1 stimulation and then declined. Taken together, TGF-β1 induces a rapid and parallel increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion molecules and concomitantly promotes the complex formations among these molecules in HEK293 cells. Accumulating data indicate that the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is required for stimulation of Cas tyrosine phosphorylation by cell adhesion (51Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K.

Eichner R.D. Mullbacher A. Med. Res. Rev. 1988; 8: 499-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The ETP toxins contribute to pathological damage in fungal infections in animals (2Richard J.L. Vet. Hum. Toxicol. 1990; 32: 63-70PubMed Google Scholar) including humans and their known immunosuppressive activity could contribute to the establishment of disseminated infections by ETP producing fungi (3Eichner R.D. Mullbacher A. Aust. J. Exp. Biol. Med. Sci. 1984; 62: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The presence of a reactive disulfide bridge accounts for much of the biological activity of these toxins (4Jordan T.W. Pedersen J.S. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 85: 33-46PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mullbacher A.

The ETP toxins induce apoptotic cell death in a variety of cells across a window of concentrations typically 0.1–3 μm (1Waring P. Eichner R.D. Mullbacher A. Med. Res.

Although the exact cellular targets of the ETP toxins have yet to be defined, they have been shown to inhibit a variety of enzymes including alcohol dehydrogenase (10Waring P. Sjaarda A. Lin Q.H.

In particular the ETP toxins target proteins with accessible thiol groups and gliotoxin has been shown to induce intramolecular disulfide formation in creatine kinase (11Hurne A.M. Chai C.L.L. Waring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25202-25206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by gliotoxin in thymocytes has been strongly linked to increased cAMP levels and histone H3 phosphorylation (15Waring P. Khan T. Sjaarda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17929-17936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because gliotoxin inhibits NFκB in intact cells, gliotoxin has been used as a tool to probe the requirement for this transcription factor. However, gliotoxin and other ETP toxins can potentially target multiple sites in cells resulting in a variety of effects, including altering intracellular calcium levels (9Beaver J.P. Waring P. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 489-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we investigate the mechanism underlying the raising of intracellular calcium levels by ETP toxins and present evidence that oxidation of plasma membrane thiol residues by these toxins may be involved in entry of calcium into nonexcitable thymocytes resulting in rapid necrotic cell death. Inhibition of this calcium influx abrogates necrotic cell death and switches the mode of cell death to apoptotic. INDO-1 was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR. Thaspisgargin was purchased from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma and made up in absolute ethanol or Me2SO before use. The 1,4-diethyl-ETP toxin was synthesized as described (16Hurne A.M. Simpson J. Waring P. Chai C.L.L. Biorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 2645-2650Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and ETP toxins were made up at 1 mg/ml in ethanol before use. Vehicle was always confirmed to have no effect on its own. Thymocytes were prepared fresh on the day of use from 10-day-old Balb/c mice obtained from the animal breeding establishment in the John Curtin School of Medical Research with ethical approval from the ANU Animal Ethics Committee. Cells from an excised thymus were passed through sterile Nybolt nylon monofilament gauze (60 microns) and pelleted at 300 × g for 15 min. Cells were always >95% viable after removal from the thymus. Cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (F15) from Invitrogen at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and used at 1 × 106/ml. The pH of the medium was adjusted by careful addition of HCl or NaOH and was stable over the course of all flow cytometry experiments. Changes to pH because of buffering in a 5% CO2 atmosphere during cell death assays were small over the time periods studied. Intracellular calcium levels were determined using the INDO-1 method (17June C.H. Rabinovitch P.S. Darznkiewicz Z. Robinson J.P. Crissman H.A. Flow Cytometry: Methods in Cell Biology Part A. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 149-173Google Scholar). Cells were treated with INDO-1 acetoxymethyl ester at 0.5 μg/ml at 37 °C at 2 × 107/ml in 400 μl for 15–10 min in F15 media with 1% fetal calf serum. After loading with dye, 100 μl of the cells were diluted into 1.9 ml of F15 followed by immediate analysis using a BD PharMingen FACStar instrument with Lysis II software. Extracellular calcium was normally 1.3 mm except when indicated otherwise. Data were collected at the rate of 100–200 cells/s and typically 200,000–600,000 events were collected depending on the experiment. Fluorescence at 405 and 485 nm and the 405/485 ratio were continuously collected. The 405/485 ratio was set to a value of 1 in channel 100 in resting cells. The 405/485 ratio was monitored for 5 min before the agent under study, e.g. ETP toxins or thapsigargin were rapidly (<10 s) added with mixing. Similarly reducing agents were rapidly added at appropriate times. Values ofRmax and Rmin were calculated and intracellular changes were calculated using the following: [Ca2+]i = Kd × {[R−Rmin]/[Rmax−R]} × Sf2/Sb2, according to Ref. 18Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar. Kd was the dissociation constant for INDO-1 and calcium and was taken as 250 nm (17June C.H. Rabinovitch P.S. Darznkiewicz Z. Robinson J.P. Crissman H.A. Flow Cytometry: Methods in Cell Biology Part A. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 149-173Google Scholar), and Sf2/Sb2 was the ratio of fluorescence values for calcium-bound/calcium-free indicator at the wavelength used to monitor the fluorescence of calcium-free INDO-1. Values ofRmax using ionomycin were typically 7–8.5 and Rmin 0.12–0.17. Sf2/Sb2 was determined to be 1.32. In some experiments the value of R(i.e. the ratio obtained experimentally) for ETP toxins particularly above 50 μm and at high pH exceededRmax determined by ionomycin. In these experiments calcium changes were expressed as changes in the ratio 405/485. Apoptosis and necrosis/late apoptosis were measured simultaneously using live cell staining with propidium iodide as described for 7-aminoactinomycin D (19Davies D. Schmid I. Diamond R.A. DeMaggio S. In Living Colour: Protocols in Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting. Springer, Berlin2000: 463-471Google Scholar). Treated cells were pelleted and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 40 μg/ml propidium iodide and kept on ice until analysis by flow cytometry using a BD PharMingen FACScan. Data were collected in a FL2 detector (585/42-nm band pass filter). All flow data were analyzed using WinMDI version 2.8 (kindly supplied by Joseph Trotter, Scripps Research Institute). Apoptotic cells appeared as a population with lowered forward scatter and a 0.5–1 log increase in propidium iodide staining. Necrotic/late apoptotic cells showed greater than 2 logs increase in propidium iodide staining. These populations have been independently confirmed as apoptotic or necrotic by sorting and morphological analysis. Apoptosis or necrosis was confirmed on bulk cell populations using morphological examination of fixed and stained sections examined using a Phillips 301 electron microscope as described (20Waring P. Lambert D. Sjaarda A. Hurne A. Beaver J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 624-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). At least 50 cells per section were visually examined for morphological appearance of apoptosis or necrosis. In a preliminary report (9Beaver J.P. Waring P. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 489-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we have shown that gliotoxin at 500 μm results in increased intracellular calcium levels in thymocytes. These concentrations result in rapid necrotic cell death in treated cells and we assumed at the time that the calcium influx was because of nonspecific membrane damage to cells. These preliminary results were carried out in medium at approximately neutral pH and using fluo-3 to determine calcium rises. To derive structure activity information on the ETP toxins, we synthesized a number of simple ETP analogs including the structurally minimalist 1,4-diethyl-ETP toxin (A), Fig.1, and tested their ability to induce intracellular calcium rises in thymocytes using ratiometric measurements of calcium using the more reproducible INDO-1. We also examined the effects of the naturally occurring toxin gliotoxin (B). During the course of these experiments we found that calcium fluxes induced by ETP toxins were very sensitive to the pH of the medium. A typical result for the synthetic 1,4-diethyl-ETP is shown in Fig.2. This data shows that the onset of a calcium rise was critically dependent on the pH of the external medium. At pH 6.5 there was no detectable calcium rise over an 80-min period, the longest time over which continuous recording of calcium changes was possible. As the pH was increased through 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5, the time of initial onset of calcium flux decreased from 60, 45, and finally 30 min. Correspondingly the time at which maximum calcium flux was attained diminished. Fig. 3 shows the calcium dose response for the 1,4-diethyl-ETP at pH 8.2. The naturally occurring toxin gliotoxin (B) also showed a strong pH dependence of calcium influx (see below) as did the recently described ETP toxin scabrosin ester 2 (data not shown). In these experiments changes in calcium levels were indicated by a change in the 405/485 ratio because the highest concentration of toxin often resulted in a greater calcium flux than ionomycin making calculation of a calcium concentration problematic. Where appropriate calcium concentrations have been calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sustained calcium rises such as those described above can be generated by two pathways. Release of calcium from internal stores, principally those associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, can result in capacitative entry through activation of CRAC (calcium release-activated channels) in the plasma membrane (21Fasolato C. Innocenti B. Pozzan T. Trends Pharmaceutical Sci. 1994; 15: 77-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Alternatively the toxin may be directly allowing calcium in through the plasma membrane without initially emptying the internal stores. Evidence presented later shows that calcium entry induced by ETP toxins occurs before overt damage to the plasma membrane of the cell, indicating that the flux was not simply because of early, toxin-induced damage to the plasma membrane. We compared the response of the cells to ETP toxins with thapsigargin, an agent well known to induce sustained calcium fluxes by releasing calcium from internal stores (22Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). This occurs indirectly following inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump responsible for sequestering cytosolic calcium. Inhibition leads to leakage of calcium from internal stores triggering a sustained but controlled calcium rise through CRAC in the presence of external calcium. Calcium rises induced by thapsigargin showed no dependence on external pH (Fig. 4), indicating that the normal response of the CRAC was independent of the external pH. Because the cells retained general membrane integrity over the 80-min period even at pH 8.5, we assumed that constant internal pH was maintained. This result suggested that unlike thapsigargin, the ETP toxins were not causing a sustained calcium increase via CRAC channels by releasing calcium from internal stores. Examination of the responses in calcium-free media supported this conclusion. Nominally calcium-free medium prepared in our laboratory typically contains about less than 100 μm total calcium and the addition of 100 μm EGTA effectively renders this “calcium-free” (23Waring P. Sjaarda A. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1995; 17: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We compared the effect of nominally calcium-free medium, with and without 100 μm EGTA, on the response of thymocytes to thapsigargin and 1,4-diethyl-ETP toxin. Nominally calcium-free medium abrogates almost all of the response from the ETP toxin at 50 μm (Fig. 5A), but still allows significant calcium flux by thapsigargin at 10 nm (Fig. 5B). This implies that an external calcium level of 60–100 μm was sufficient to sustain a substantial influx through a CRAC but not by the mechanism involved in ETP action. As expected, the presence of 100 μm EGTA abrogated both the thapsigargin- and ETP-induced sustained calcium flux (Fig. 5). Note, however, the typical calcium spike induced by thapsigargin in calcium-free medium indicative of the transient release of internal calcium stores associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. No spike is ever seen with 50 μm 1,4-diethyl-ETP toxin under the same conditions (Fig. 6). Interestingly the naturally occurring gliotoxin does cause a small calcium increase in the absence of external calcium that was qualitatively different from that caused by thapsigargin. We attribute this to release of mitochondrial calcium (see below). Activation of CRAC has been shown to be sensitive to the presence of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, which has been shown to reduce the response induced by thapsigargin by about 50% (24Foster F.M. Conigrave A.D. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We confirmed this for thapsigargin-treated thymocytes (Fig.7A), but detected no inhibitory effect on the response induced by gliotoxin (Fig.7B). In fact the calcium rise was enhanced in the presence of genistein. Similar results were found for the 1,4-diethyl-ETP toxin (data not shown). Taken together this data suggests that the ETP toxin does not cause an influx of extracellular calcium by releasing internal stores. The alternative explanation was direct entry of calcium through the plasma membrane. The biological activity of the ETP toxins was generally abolished in the presence of reducing agents. This was attributed to rapid reduction to the dithiol form of the toxin. The dithiol form of the toxin cannot easily form mixed disulfides with target macromolecules. Reducing agents can, however, initiate redox cycling of some ETP toxins (25Munday R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1982; 41: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the presence of 10–2000 μm dithiothreitol at t = 0 significantly inhibited the calcium flux as shown in Fig.8. Thus redox cycling initiated by a reducing agent with production of deleterious reactive oxygen species cannot underlie the principal mechanism of calcium entry by ETP toxins. There was a small effect at high dithiothreitol concentrations when present from t = 0 that could indicate a minor contribution from the reactive oxygen species. More dramatically, addition of dithiothreitol after the sustained calcium rise was established reverses the calcium flux indicating that a reversible oxidative event has triggered calcium influx. Fig.9 illustrates this for gliotoxin at pH 6.8, 7.4, and 8.2, which again shows the strong pH dependence of calcium flux. Addition of 500 μm dithiothreitol was sufficient to rapidly reverse the calcium flux to almost resting levels. Furthermore, addition of ionomycin after reversal by dithiothreitol still produces a massive calcium influx (data not shown). This indicates that the plasma membrane was intact and the effect was a true reversal of the calcium flux presumably modulated by the action of plasma membrane calcium pumps and sequestering pumps in the cell.FIG. 9Dithiothreitol reverses the intracellular calcium rises induced by 100 μmgliotoxin at pH 6.8, 7.4, and 8.2. Dithiothreitol was added at thearrow and the calcium flux continued to be monitored.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) GSH is generally considered to be cell impermeant. Significantly glutathione rapidly reverses the calcium flux caused by ETP toxins (Fig. 10). The known calcium channel blocker Ni2+ (26Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. Science. 1999; 283: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) also blocks the calcium rises induced by ETP toxins in a dose-dependent manner as seen in Fig. 11. Once established, the calcium flux can also be reversed by adding Ni2+ at 200 μm (data not shown). This is analogous to the effect of reducing agents once the flux was established. Although we could find no evidence that the synthetic diethyl-ETP compound released any calcium from internal stores (Fig. 5), the naturally occurring toxin gliotoxin did appear to result in a small continuous release of some calcium from internal stores revealed by a small rise in internal calcium in calcium-free medium containing EGTA. Because the effect of external pH, added reducing agents, and genistein does not support (indirect) CRAC opening by ETP toxins, it was important to establish if there was an alternative explanation for this calcium rise. Gliotoxin has been shown to induce calcium efflux from isolated mitochondria inhibited by cyclosporin A (27Schweizer M. Richter C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13401-13405Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 28Silva J.P. Winterhalter K.H. Richter C. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of thymocytes with cyclosporin A at 20 μm significantly inhibited the small calcium rise induced by gliotoxin observed in calcium-free media/EGTA (Fig.12). This was consistent with gliotoxin releasing calcium from mitochondrial stores. Significantly cyclosporin A had no detectable effect on the large calcium fluxes induced by 1,4-diethyl-ETP toxin or gliotoxin in normal medium (pH 8.0) with external calcium at 1.3 mm (data not shown) indicating no role of mitochondrial calcium release in the large calcium fluxes observed. Cyclosporin A also had no effect on calcium rises induced by thapsigargin in normal or calcium-free medium (data not shown). Gliotoxin and other ETP toxins induce apoptotic cell death in a variety of cells. Typical of many toxins, the mode of cell death switches to necrotic when a critical concentration is reached. With gliotoxin-treated thymocytes switch to necrosis occurs at concentrations above 10 μm. Similarly the 1,4-diethyl-ETP toxin causes significant necrotic cell death at concentrations above 10 μm. The kinetics of necrotic cell death show that overt plasma membrane damage as assessed by propidium iodide entry into cells only occurs after the calcium flux has maximized (Fig. 13, A and B). In this figure early onset of necrosis was assessed by an increase in propidium iodide staining of greater than 102 and as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Necrotic cell death was apparent when the calcium flux peaks (point B in Fig. 13). It is important to note that the cells in Fig. 13 treated with 1 and 5 μm toxin will go on to display the features of apoptotic cell death after 6–8 h (15Waring P. Khan T. Sjaarda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17929-17936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Waring P. Beaver J. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Necrosis and apoptosis were independently confirmed using electron microscopy. If necrosis was being caused by an influx of calcium through the plasma membrane, it should be possible to inhibit this death by blocking calcium flux by changing the pH, the presence of reducing agents, or the presence of Ni2+. Fig.14 shows the effect of both pH and added DTT on necrosis induced by 20 μm 1,4-diethyl-ETP toxin. It can be seen that significant necrotic cell death occurs at pH 8.1 that was abrogated at pH 7.3. Apoptosis was unaffected by pH changes. We then examined the effect of added DTT on necrotic cell death. Careful examination of the dot plot FACS profile of intracellular calcium increase caused by ETP toxins over time consistently indicated two populations of cells corresponding to high and very high calcium fluxes as shown in Fig. 15. Furthermore, onset of the greater calcium rise, which occurs about 60 min after toxin addition, was accompanied by a drop in forward scatter indicating irreversible damage. We therefore tested the effects of DTT added at either 45 or 65 min on cell viability at 4 h. Addition of DTT at 45 min, by which time the first calcium rise was complete (see Fig. 15), gave significant protection, whereas addition at 65 min (by which time the highest calcium levels were reached) gave no protection as shown in Fig. 14. Correspondingly, DTT at 45 min dramatically reversed the calcium flux, whereas addition at 65 min had little effect (Fig.16) and the cells died by necrosis (Fig. 14). This indicated a window of 15–20 min over which the calcium can rise significantly above resting levels in the cell without irreversible damage occurring. Glutathione was also similarly capable of rescuing cells from necrosis caused by a rise in intracellular calcium. Reductants present at t = 0 inhibit necrotic cell death but also affect apoptotic cell death because they maintain the toxin in the inactive dithiol form. Gliotoxin at 3 μm has been shown to induce all the features of apoptosis in thymocytes at 8 h. At 50 μmthe mode of cell death was necrotic with little apoptotic cell death. We examined the effects of the calcium channel blocker Ni2+on the level of apoptosis induced by gliotoxin in thymocytes at 3 and 50 μm at pH 8.1. When we treated cells with 200 μm Ni2+ we found that cells treated with 50 μm gliotoxin showed a dramatic increase in the number of cells dying via apoptosis after 8 h (Table I). Abrogation of the calcium rise by Ni2+ resulted in inhibition of necrotic death and progression to apoptotic cell death at 8 h. Ni2+ has no effect on normal cells or cells treated with 3 μmtoxin.Table IThe effect of 200 μM Ni2+ on cell death induced by gliotoxin in murine thymocytes at 8 hTreatment1-aCells were treated with gliotoxin at the designated concentration at t = 0 or both gliotoxin and 200 μm nickel acetate at t = 0.

Panels A and B in Fig.17 shows cells treated with 1 μm gliotoxin for 8 h displaying the typical features of apoptotic cell death with condensed chromatin. As expected, cells treated with toxin at 50 μm exhibited swelling and loss of organelle integrity consistent with necrosis as shown in thepanels C and D of Fig. 17. Panels E and F in this figure shows thymocytes treated simultaneously with 50 μm toxin and 200 μmNi2+. These cells now show the typical morphology of apoptotic cell death. The ETP toxins and in particular gliotoxin are currently in common use as experimental tools in the inhibition of the transcription factor NFκB (12Pahl H.L. Krauss B. Schulze-Osthoff K. Decker T.

They are potent inhibitors of cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in a number of cell types. These compounds are thought to act via the disulfide bridge resulting in covalent protein modification and/or thiol oxidation (29Waring P. Beaver J. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Recently gliotoxin has been shown to activate the ryanodine receptor and release calcium in artificial membrane preparations by interaction with cysteine residues in this calcium channel (30Green D.

The ETP toxins appear therefore to target multiple sites in the cell consistent with a role as fungal chemical defense agents. It has been established that the mode of cell death induced by ETP toxins switches to necrotic at concentrations above 10 μm. Here we present evidence for the interaction of ETP toxins with a redox-sensitive plasma membrane calcium channel in thymocytes resulting in intracellular calcium rises and necrotic cell death. The mode by which nonphysiological rises in intracellular calcium kills cells has been well documented (31Nicotera P. Bellomo G. Orrenius S. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 449-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). We eliminated the possibility of redox cycling by the ETP toxin with the production of deleterious reactive oxygen species by the following observations: (a) there was no added exogenous or known endogenous reductants in the culture medium that would facilitate redox cycling; (b) addition of DTT over a wide concentration range (10–2000 μm) only functions to significantly inhibit calcium flux in a dose-dependent manner, there is no indication of an enhanced effect because of redox cycling; (c) several experiments using superoxide dismutase and catalase failed to demonstrate any effect on observed calcium fluxes caused by the ETP toxins (data not shown). The observed pH dependence on induced calcium flux is consistent with direct interaction of the ETP compound with an accessible thiol residue on the plasma membrane and parallels the observed pH effect on the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase treated with gliotoxin (10Waring P. Sjaarda A. Lin Q.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the latter case inactivation was because of covalent modification of a cysteine group in the enzyme. Modification of plasma membrane thiols can be either by direct formation of a mixed disulfide with the toxin or oxidation of a pair of physically close cysteine residues by the ETP toxin. We have already demonstrated the possibility of the latter in creatine kinase (11Hurne A.M. Chai C.L.L. Waring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25202-25206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Either mixed disulfide formation or oxidation of a pair of thiol residues can be reversed by the addition of reducing agents. Reversal of the calcium flux by dithiothreitol and particularly cell impermeant glutathione is consistent with reduction to the free thiol residues in the putative plasma membrane channel. We have already demonstrated this reductive effect in reconstituted ryanodine receptor (30Green D. Pace S.M. Hurne A.M. Waring P. Hart J.D.E. Dulhunty A.F. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 175: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Likewise Ni2+ will block the channel after it is activated by ETP toxin. We found no evidence that influx of calcium induced by ETP toxins was caused by prior depletion of endoplasmic reticulum-associated calcium stores (capacitative calcium entry). Thapsigargin-induced calcium rises were independent of pH and unlike ETP calcium fluxes were partly abrogated by a protein kinase inhibitor. However, we cannot completely rule out a unique and direct interaction of ETP toxins with CRAC channels until we define the nature of the channel affected by ETP toxins more closely. No transient calcium release was detected for 1,4-diethyl-ETP toxin and the small increases induced by gliotoxin could be attributed to release from mitochondria. This is in fact the first evidence for targeting of mitochondria in situ by these toxins and may be related to induction of apoptotic cell death. Cyclosporin A, which abrogated the small calcium release from mitochondria when examined in calcium-free medium, had no effect on the large calcium influx induced by ETP toxins in normal media (data not shown). As expected cyclosporin A also had no effect on sustained thapsigargin-induced calcium rises (external calcium present) or transient release from internal stores (no external calcium; data not shown). Necrotic cell death by ETP toxins could be directly related to the influx of calcium through the redox active channel. We have previously eliminated calcium as a factor in apoptotic death induced by ETP toxins in thymocytes (9Beaver J.P. Waring P. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 489-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Necrotic cell death was strongly pH-dependent as expected if the principal insult causing necrotic death is calcium influx that also shows strong pH dependence. Ni2+ also abrogated necrotic cell death. Interestingly abrogation of the calcium flux by Ni2+ caused enhanced apoptotic cell death by 50 μm gliotoxin to occur at 8 h, effectively allowing separation of the two modes of cell death and reaffirming that necrosis by ETP toxins was principally mediated by direct calcium flux across the intact plasma membrane. The latter is also consistent with our observation of early exposure of phosphatidylserine in propidium iodide negative thymocytes undergoing death by necrosis caused by gliotoxin. Phosphatidylserine exposure could be triggered by high, local near membrane calcium increases (20Waring P. Lambert D. Sjaarda A. Hurne A. Beaver J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 624-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The time-dependent protection of cells from necrotic cell death by added DTT indicates that thymocytes can survive brief (about 30 min) high calcium transients without significant damage. We cannot rule out the possibility that homeostasis of other cellular cations such as Na+ is also affected by opening this channel. A number of groups have reported the presence of redox-sensitive calcium channels in cellular plasma membranes (32Krippeit-Drews P. Haberland C. Fingerle J. Drews G. Lange F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 209: 139-145Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33Az-ma T. Saeki N. Yuge O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 1462-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 34Josephson R.A.

J. 1994; 297: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and in the case of the ryanodine receptor, a cysteine residue has been identified as a target for nitrosylation by nitric oxide (36Sun J. Xin C., Eu, J.P. Meissner G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11158-11162Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). These studies have focused on the effects of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, or other reactive species such as NO on calcium channels. In some cases these effects have been related to cell death. Calcium channel blockers also typically inhibit cell death in some instances, although the nature of the cell death is not discussed. Here we show that the naturally occurring and synthetic members of the ETP class of toxins also target similar (or the same) redox active calcium channels in the plasma membrane and result in necrotic cell death. It is intriguing that these naturally occurring toxins have evolved to exploit a redox-sensitive channel in plasma membranes for one mode of cell killing. The precise identity of this channel is currently under investigation. We are grateful to Geoff Osborne and Sabine Gruninger of the John Curtin School of Medical Research Flow laboratory and Cathy Gillespie of the EM unit for excellent technical assistance."

Thus, regulation of actin filaments may play a critical role in contributing to the formation of long-term memory. Here, we report the cloning of actinfilin, a brain-specific Kelch protein, which interacts with F-actin. Actinfilin contains an amino-terminal POZ/BTB domain and carboxyl positioned six tandem Kelch repeats that presumably form six blades of β-propeller structure of the Kelch domain. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that the amino-terminal POZ domain mediated actinfilin-actinfilin interaction. The recombinant Kelch domain alone was sufficient to mediate binding to F-actin. Immunohistochemistry studies of rat brain sections suggested that actinfilin is broadly expressed in neurons of most regions of the brain. The subcellular localization of actinfilin was studied by biochemical fractionation and immunogold labeling. The results showed the postsynaptic density distribution of actinfilin.

Activity-induced actin assembly and disassembly is thought to play a critical role in shaping the dendritic spine, a subcellular protrusion that is found in more than 90% of glutamatergic synapses. The changes in number, size, and morphology of spines are linked to long-term memory (1Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 397-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 2Chang F.L. Greenough W.T. Brain Res. 1984; 309: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 3Crick F.

Increasing evidence suggests that the dynamic reorganization of actin filament is probably mediated by several classes of molecules including small second messages and regulatory protein factors that interact with G- or F-actin. Thus, molecular identification and functional understanding of regulatory components may provide important insights into both the dynamic morphology of synaptic structure and the activities that are coupled with polymerization, stability, and subcellular anchoring of actin filaments. CAP701 is a scaffolding protein that was purified from the kidney on the basis of its interaction with the carboxyl terminus of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (7Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M. Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Like other PDZ domain-containing proteins, such as PSD95 or INAD (inactivationno afterpotential D), the CAP70 coding sequence is essentially composed of four tandemly positioned PDZ domains. In contrast to other known PDZ domain-containing proteins, CAP70 has the activity to dynamically alter the oligomerization state of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel, thereby inducing potentiation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-induced chloride channel activity (7Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M. Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The native CAP70 protein was found in actin-rich domains, such as the apical surfaces of epithelial cells in the small intestine and kidney as well as flopodia-like structures in cultured epithelial cells. 2S. Wang and M. Li, unpublished results. In addition, the CAP70 protein was also detected in neuronal tissue, where the membrane receptors that interact with CAP70 remain unknown. Interestingly, in contrast to what was found in the kidney and small intestine, the brain CAP70 protein was insoluble and co-sedimented with cytoskeletal components that are abundant in actin. However, purified recombinant CAP70 protein behaved as a monomer and displayed no detectable interaction with purified actin. Together, the evidence suggests that CAP70 may interact with actin filaments and/or other cytoskeletal components via an intermediate adaptor protein that specifically links CAP70 to cytoskeletal components, thereby connecting the CAP70 interacting cell surface receptors and ion channels to intracellular cytoskeleton structures. To identify genes that encode CAP70 interacting proteins, we screened a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library using a GAL4-CAP70 fusion protein. The identified candidate cDNAs were tested using a combination of biochemical and molecular approaches. Here, we report on one of the identified cDNAs, which encodes a previously unknown actin-binding protein with restricted expression in the brain. Molecular cloning reagents were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Promega (Madison, WI). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B was from Amersham Biosciences. Rabbit anti-PSD95 antibody (1:5,000 for immunoblot) and rabbit anti-CAP70 antibody (1:2,000 for immunoblot) were generated against the GST (glutathione S-transferase) fusion protein. Goat anti-rabbit lactate dehydrogenase (1:500 for immunoblot) was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Mouse anti-c-Myc (9E10, 1:100 for immunoblot) and mouse anti-actin (C-2, 1:100 for immunoblot) were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-FLAG (M5, 1:2,500 for immunoblot) and mouse anti-hemagglutinin (F-7, 1:2,500 for immunoblot) were from Sigma. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma, except as indicated. The full-length of CAP70 was subcloned into a yeast expression vector, pPC97, in a fusion with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. This construct was transformed in yeast strain PJ69-4a (MATa trp1–90i leu2–3,112 ura 3–52 his3–200 gal4Δ gal80Δ GAL2-ADE2 LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 met2::GAL7-lacZ) (8James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the lithium acetate method (9Gietz D., St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on leucine-deficient (Leu−) medium and subsequently transformed with an oligo(dT)-primed rat hippocampal cDNA library subcloned into pPC86. Positive clones were selected on triple-deficient plates (Leu-, Trp-, and adenine-). Their plasmids were isolated using the RPM Yeast Plasmid isolation kit (Bio 101, Vista, CA) and transformed into Escherichia coli HB101. The E. coli clones containing the pPC86 construct were rescued and their plasmids were isolated. The positive clones were co-transformed into yeast PJ69-4a with either the bait vector or the original pPC97 vector to confirm the interaction. The cDNA encoding the actinfilin NH2-terminal domain (amino acids 1–344) was subcloned into the pMBP vector in a fusion with an NH2-terminal MBP tag and transformed in E. coliBL21. The fusion protein was purified by an amylose affinity column (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The purified fusion protein was then used to immunize rabbits. Various organs of Sprague-Dawley rats were ground in liquid nitrogen. Twenty milligrams of the powdered tissue was solubilized in 250 μl of SDS solubilization buffer (containing 1% (w/v) CHES, 2% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol). An equal amount of SDS sample buffer was then added. The samples were boiled for 5 min. A 5-μl (200 μg) quantity of each sample was loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell Inc.). A purified anti-actinfilin antibody (in 1:5,000 dilution) was used as the primary antibody for Western blot analysis. Goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody and an ECL Western blot analysis system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to visualize the immunocomplex. Immunohistochemical staining of adult male Sprague-Dawley rat brain was performed on horizontal 40-μm microtome sections using antibodies against actinfilin and PSD95. Biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody and a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) were used to visualize the immunocomplex in the sections. Protein fractionation studies were performed using brain homogenates from adult Sprague-Dawley rats as described by Carlin et al. (10Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼5 g of fresh cerebellum was homogenized in 50 ml of 320 mm sucrose buffer (320 mm sucrose, 1 mm NaCO3). The sample was saved as a brain lysate and centrifuged for 10 min at 1,400 × g. The supernatant was saved and the pellet was then homogenized again in 50 ml of the same buffer and spun for 10 min at 710 × g. The supernatant was pooled with the supernatant from the previous spin and spun for a further 10 min at 755 × g. The supernatant was then saved as s2 and the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of the same buffer and saved as P2, then the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was spun again for 10 min at 13,800 ×g and saved as s5. The resultant pellet was resuspended and homogenized in 12 ml of a low-salt buffer (320 mm sucrose, 1 mm NaCO3) (the sample was saved as p5) and loaded onto a sucrose gradient (0.85 m sucrose, 1.0m sucrose, and 1.2 m sucrose in 1 mm NaCO3). After a 2-h spin at 82,500 ×g, the sample above 0.85 m sucrose, the sample between 0.85 m and 1.0 m sucrose, the sample between 1.0 and 1.2 m sucrose, and the sample of the pellet were resuspended in 30 ml of a low-salt buffer yielding 6g1, 6g2, 6g3, and 6g4 fractions, respectively. The 6g3 was referred to as the synaptosomal fraction in previous literature (11Chen H.J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The 6g3, the synaptosomal fraction, was solubilized by adding 30 ml of 1% ice-cold Triton X-100 in a low-salt buffer for 15 min and centrifuged at 32,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1.25 ml of the low-salt buffer as the Triton 1 PSD fraction. Samples of the supernatant and the pellet were saved as s7 and Triton 1. The Triton 1 fraction was loaded onto a sucrose gradient (1.0 msucrose, 1.5 m sucrose, and 2.0 m sucrose in 1 mm NaCO3). The PSD fraction was recovered after a 2-h spin at 201,800 × g. The PSD fraction was resuspended in 6 ml of the low-salt buffer (the pellet was saved as the PSD fraction). The PSD fraction was then further solubilized by adding 6 ml of 1% Triton X-100 (1% Triton X-100 in 150 mm KCl). The PSD fraction was centrifuged at 210,800 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) and saved as the Triton 2 PSD fraction. An aliquot of 5 μl of the saved samples was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotted with anti-PSD95 antibody, anti-actinfilin antibody, anti-actin, or anti-lactate dehydrogenase antibody. COS7 cells were transfected with different combinations of constructs for co-immunoprecipitation in heterologous cells. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 015 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmNaN3, and a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin)) at room temperature for 30 min. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation of the lysate at 27,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. An aliquot of 50 μl of the supernatant was incubated with the corresponding antibody and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (1:1 slurry) overnight at 4 °C. The mixture was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (containing 0.5 m NaCl). The proteins were eluted with 30 μl of SDS sample buffer. An aliquot of 10 μl from each sample was loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blot analysis was performed with the corresponding antibody. Globular actin (G-actin) was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle (12Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and gel purified on Sephacryl S-300 (a gift of Hua Chen and Eaton E. Lattman). The ability of GST fusion proteins to associate with F-actin was examined for bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins using modified co-sedimentation assays (13Bailly M. Ichetovkin I. Grant W. Zebda N. Machesky L.M. Segall J.E. Condeelis J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 620-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). GST fusion protein (1 μm, final concentration) and G-actin (10 μm, final concentration) were mixed in 300 μl of F-actin polymerization buffer (5 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C overnight. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer. An aliquot of 10 μl from each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and visualized with Coomassie Blue. The hippocampus and cerebellum of an adult rat were processed for post-embedding immunogold labeling as described previously (14Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. Sans N. Worley P.F. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Wenthold R.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1722-1732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. Li M. Methods in Molecular Biology: NMDA Receptor Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 113-120Google Scholar). In addition, similar regions were examined in a mouse (not shown). Animals anesthetized and perfused were handled in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication 85-23; NIDCD protocol number 874-98). Fixed brain sections were frozen in liquid propane in a Leica CPC (Vienna, Austria) and were freeze-substituted in a Leica AFS. For immunolabeling, 10-nm immunogold (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Using CAP70 as a bait for the yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified several cDNA fragments whose open reading frames encode candidate interacting proteins for CAP70. In addition to known genes, such as synaptic RAS-GTPase activating protein (synGAP) (11Chen H.J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 16Kim J.H. Liao D. Lau L.F. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and SAP90/PSD-95-associated proteins (17Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), both of which are present in the nervous system and are found in a macrodomain known as the postsynaptic density, we also found several cDNA fragments encoding a novel Kelch domain protein. Because of its interaction with actin as shown in the later part of this paper, we called it “actinfilin” (accession numberAF505655). The amino acid sequence of the cloned rat actinfilin was then used as a probe, which identified a human EST (AL555656) available in the NCBI data base that encodes a stretch of amino acid sequences nearly identical to the reported amino acid sequence shown (Fig.1a). However, the upstream sequence from the putative methionine displays significant sequence divergence from that of the human sequence. The human chromosomal localization of the actinfilin gene was assigned to chromosome 1 (NT_025635.7, NCBI gi17434913), suggesting thatactinfilin is a single copy gene. Actinfilin sequence characteristics begin with a proline-rich domain located at the NH2 terminus, which is followed by an amino-terminal BTB or POZ domain (see review in Ref. 18Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A cluster of six tandemly positioned Kelch domains is located on the carboxyl terminus (see review in Ref. 19Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, a and c). The BTB/POZ domain is a conserved protein-protein interaction domain that has been found in diverse proteins ranging from cell surface membrane proteins, such as a Shaker-type potassium channel (20Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), to nuclear transcription factors, such as a promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (21Dong S. Zhu J. Reid A. Strutt P. Guidez F. Zhong H.J. Wang Z.Y. Licht J. Waxman S. Chomienne C. Chen Z. Zelent A. Chen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3624-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The six Kelch repeats position with little or no intervening sequences and share significant homology at the amino acid level. The signature “GG … Y-X6-W” motif is perfectly conserved in all six Kelch repeats, which further supports the idea that they form six blades of a typical β-turn propeller structure as seen in galactose oxidase from Hypomyces rosellus (19Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the overall domain organization of actinfilin bears a significant similarity to the other previously known Kelch domain-containing proteins as shown in Fig. 1b. The proline-rich region and the restricted tissue distribution are unique to actinfilin in the Kelch family proteins. Indeed, theDrosophila Kelch protein and actinfilin share the same overall domain organization. The amino-terminal domain of theDrosophila Kelch is known for its role in subcellular localization (22Robinson D.N. Cooley L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 799-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the proline-rich domain in actinfilin serves as an interaction site with another signaling protein containing proline-binding motifs, such as Src homology 3 or Homer domains. An antibody has been generated using a recombinant fusion protein corresponding to amino acids 1–344 of rat actinfilin cDNA. The resultant antiserum identified a fusion polypeptide only from cells transfected with the epitope-tagged actinfilin (Fig.2a, lane 11). In the native tissue, the antibody identified a polypeptide of approximately 73,000 daltons, consistent with the predicted molecular weight derived from the amino acid sequence. To determine the tissue distribution of actinfilin, we performed an immunoblot to test for actinfilin expression in a panel of selected tissue extracts. The actinfilin protein was mainly found in the nervous system, especially in the cerebrum and the cerebellum (Fig. 2a). In contrast, crude lysates from other tissues although giving rise to an actin signal as detected by immunoblot, displayed no detectable amount of actinfilin. Using reverse transcriptase-PCR, the actinfilin mRNA message was abundant in the cortex, the cerebellum, and the hippocampus. The signal was also detectable in the testis, and to a lesser extent in the thymus. 3Y. Chen and M. Li, unpublished results.During development, the expression of actinfilin in the brain increased gradually and reached the maximal level in the adult animal (Fig.2b). The evidence of restricted tissue expression supports the idea that actinfilin plays a role in the neuronal function. POZ domains have been found to involve mediating protein-protein interaction to yield oligomers such as dimers (23Ahmad K.F. Engel C.K. Prive G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12123-12128Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 24Chen W. Zollman S. Couderc J.L. Laski F.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3424-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A homologous POZ domain in Shaker potassium channels, also known as the NAB or T1 domain, mediates subunit interaction to specify compatible channel assembly among subunits of different subfamilies to form tetramers (20Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). To test for the homomeric interaction of actinfilin, we constructed differentially tagged, full-length and various truncated forms of actinfilin as shown in the Fig.3a. These fusion constructs allow for the transient expression in cultured mammalian cells. To test for association, lysates from transiently transfected COS7 cells were prepared, immunoprecipitated, and detected by immunoblot using different combinations of plasmids. For the combination of Myc-POZ and FLAG-actinfilin, we found that a Myc-tagged POZ domain was precipitated by anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3b, lane 3). In contrast, a Myc fusion protein lacking the POZ domain was not precipitated (Fig. 3, lane 6). This result is consistent with the notion that actinfilin molecules interact with each other homomerically via association of the POZ domains. The presence of six Kelch repeats suggests the possibility of interaction with F-actin. To directly test this hypothesis, the coding sequence for the entire six Kelch domains (amino acids 279–640) was expressed inE. coli and purified as glutathione S-transferase fusion (GST-Kelch). The resultant proteins were used for testing the interaction with F-actin using a standard co-sedimentation technique (“Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 4shows that rabbit muscle F-actin was able to precipitate the GST-Kelch (lane 6). In contrast, the purified GST-Kelch was soluble and failed to be precipitated under the same conditions (lane 4). Control GST fusion proteins could not be precipitated, although a maltose-binding protein fusion of Kelch could also be precipitated. 4Y. Chen and M. Li, unpublished data. In addition, the amount of precipitated protein as judged by Coomassie staining was consistent, which is in agreement with the previous finding that the interaction of the GST-Kelch domain with F-actin apparently had no detectable effect on the amount of F-actin precipitated in this experiment (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6). This result is consistent with the proposed functional role in bundling actin filament with no direct effect on actin polymerization. In brain lysates, both CAP70 and actinfilin behaved as insoluble protein 5N. Stricker, Y. Chen, and M. Li, unpublished data. in a typical nondetergent lysis buffer, similar to that of the postsynaptic density. To test whether actinfilin was associated with certain specific biochemical or subcellular structures in the brain, a postsynaptic density preparation was obtained using standard techniques (see “Experimental Procedures”) and the resultant proteins from the different preparation steps were collected and analyzed by immunoblot using specific antibodies against PSD95, actin, actinfilin, and lactose dehydrogenase. Consistent with previous results, PSD95 was enriched in the pellet after s5 and was resistant to detergent treatments (Triton 1 and Triton 2) (Fig. 5, lanes 11 and 13). Likewise, actin displayed a similar separation profile as PSD95. Actinfilin also had the same separation profile as PSD95 before the Triton X-100 treatment (Fig. 5, lanes 1–9) and was abundant in the synaptosome fraction (Fig. 5, lane 8). After Triton X-100 treatment, most of the actinfilin, however, was released from the PSD pellet by the detergent treatment that led to only a small fraction of actinfilin presented in the PSD preparation (Fig. 5, lanes 9–13). This result suggests that actinfilin was not the core component of the PSD protein complex. In contrast, a typical soluble protein, lactate dehydrogenase, did not show any enrichment in the insoluble preparations nor did it display any resistance to detergent treatment (Fig. 5, lanes 8–13). Specific antibodies against actinfilin and PSD95 were used to determine the protein localization in different regions of the rat brain. Fig.6 shows that PSD95 was localized primarily to the dendritic microdomains, which is consistent with the published reports. Actinfilin was specifically expressed in neurons but undetectable in glia (Fig. 6). Actinfilin was widely localized in various brain regions including the cortex, the pons, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum. In the cortex and hippocampus, the most prominent staining was observed in the pyramidal cells. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells and granule cells were also positive. Generally, the staining was concentrated mostly in the soma and the dendritic processes (Fig. 6). To determine the subcellular localization of actinfilin protein, a specific antibody was used to probe actinfilin localization by immunogold methods. In the cerebellum (Fig.7, A and B) and the hippocampus (Fig. 7, C and D), immunogold labeling for actinfilin was associated most commonly with dendrite cytoplasm. Often the labeling decorated membranous structures on the cytoplasmic side of the plasmic membrane or within the cytoplasm. Substantial labeling was seen in the dendrites of pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and Purkinje cells (Fig. 7B) of the cerebellum, as well as in interneuron dendrites (Fig. 7D). Labeling of synapses was variable. In many cases, a moderate postsynaptic labeling was observed, with gold particles associated with membranous cytoplasmic structures as in the dendrites (Fig. 7, B and D), as well as with the postsynaptic density and postsynaptic side of membrane (Fig. 7, C and D). The identification of CAP70-binding proteins including synaptic RAS-GTPase activating protein, SAP90/PSD-95-associated proteins, and actinfilin suggests a role for CAP70 to nucleate a macromolecular complex. The biochemical interactions of CAP70 with these proteins were confirmed using direct binding assays of recombinant fusion proteins.4 Given that the actinfilin is found at least partially localized at the postsynaptic density, it would be interesting to test whether the COOH termini of these proteins are indeed responsible for the binding and which one(s) of the four PDZ domains is responsible for the interactions. Actin polymerization, stability, and subcellular anchoring are regulated by a number of factors including a large group of actin-binding proteins (25Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). The Kelch domain-containing actin-binding proteins were first identified from a Drosophila mutant, kelch, which encodes a protein that is involved in proper morphology of actin-rich intracellular canals (26Xue F. Cooley L. Cell. 1993; 72: 681-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 27Robinson D.N. Cant K. Cooley L. Development. 1994; 120: 2015-2025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A unitary cluster of six Kelch repeats usually forms a β-propeller structure and the interaction between the Kelch domain-containing protein and actin has been reported (for review, see Ref. 19Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Current evidence is consistent with the model that this group of proteins interacts with F-actin via the conserved Kelch domain. Because many Kelch-containing proteins including actinfilin in this report contain homomeric protein-protein interaction domains, such as the POZ domain, the model further suggests that a Kelch-containing protein may play a role in actin bundling. Supporting evidence comes from studies of thelimulus α-scruin and β-scruin, which are two proteins that lack POZ or other known protein-protein interactions but contain 12 Kelch domains that are separated into two clusters of six tandemly positioned Kelch domains, reminiscent of a dimeric form of actinfilin. Microscopic studies suggested that scruin serves as a bivalent interacting bridge that bundles the actin filaments (28Way M. Sanders M. Garcia C. Sakai J. Matsudaira P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The combination of the NH2-terminal protein-protein interaction POZ domain and the COOH-terminal positioned six Kelch domains makes actinfilin a member of the N-dimer/C-propeller subfamily (19Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Truncated recombinant protein containing the six Kelch repeats, which presumably form blades of a propeller structure, is sufficient to mediate binding to F-actin. It should be noted that there is no experimental evidence that actinfilin or recombinant Kelch domain functions with dimeric stoichiometry, Fig. 2 shows that actinfilin is capable of interacting with itself via the POZ domain to form a homomeric oligomer(s). Similar to previous reports concerning several other Kelch proteins (22Robinson D.N. Cooley L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 799-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 28Way M. Sanders M.

Avraham S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2361-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the full-length recombinant protein of actinfilin tends to aggregate. We found this behavior to be more prominent when the full-length recombinant protein was overexpressed in transfected cells in which actinfilin forms aggregates. The appearance does not display morphological similarity to the known subcellular organelle structures.4 A better understanding of this highly aggregated structure and protein half-lives of the native actinfilin may provide the rationale to use various truncated forms of actinfilin to perform functional studies. In addition to actinfilin, there are at least two other Kelch-containing actin-binding proteins that are localized in the brain, including mayven (29Soltysik-Espanola M. Rogers R.A. Jiang S. Kim T.A. Gaedigk R. White R.A. Avraham H. Avraham S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2361-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), NRP/B or ENC1 (30Kim T.A. Lim J. Ota S. Raja S. Rogers R. Rivnay B.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3038-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Except for NRP/B (or ENC1), which is reported to be a nuclear matrix protein, mayven is in the cytoplasmic compartments but may not be restricted to any specific subcellular domains. It is of great interest to determine their specific subcellular localization as several subcellular structures are abundant in actin filaments, such as the postsynaptic density and its adjacent spines of neurons. The biochemical fractionation and immunogold labeling studies reported in this paper show that actinfilin is partially localized in the postsynaptic density (Figs. 5 and 7). It is known that the actin-based membrane domain structures are critical for proper synaptic transmission in cultured neurons (32Allison D.W. Gelfand V.I. Spector I. Craig A.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2423-2436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The evidence presented in this report now associates the Kelch domain-mediated actin-binding proteins to the postsynaptic density. Thus, actinfilin and its related proteins are possibly involved in cytoskeleton-related neuronal functions. Supporting this notion is the recent identification of gigaxonin, a Kelch domain-containing protein with ubiquitous tissue distribution. Mutations of gigaxonin are found in patients with giant axonal neuropathy (33Bomont P. Cavalier L. Blondeau F. Ben Hamida C. Belal S. Tazir M. Demir E. Topaloglu H. Korinthenberg R. Tuysuz B. Landrieu P. Hentati F. Koenig M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Thus, the functional understanding of Kelch proteins such as actinfilin may provide further insights into the actin regulation and their roles in the nervous systems.

Conformational flexibility in the GroEL apical domain, which could account for the variety of substrates that GroEL binds, is illustrated by comparison of several independent crystallographic structures of apical domain constructs that show conformational plasticity in helices H and I. Additionally, ESI-MS indicates that apical domain constructs have co-populated conformations at neutral pH. To assess the ability of different apical domain conformers to bind co-chaperone and substrate, model peptides corresponding to the mobile loop of GroES and to helix D from rhodanese were studied. Analysis of apical domain-peptide complexes by ESI-MS indicates that only the folded or partially folded apical domain conformations form complexes that survive gas phase conditions. Fluorescence binding studies show that the apical domain can fully bind both peptides independently. No competition for binding was observed, suggesting the peptides have distinct apical domain-binding sites. Blocking the GroES-apical domain-binding site in GroEL rendered the chaperonin inactive in binding GroES and in assisting the folding of denatured rhodanese, but still capable of binding non-native proteins, supporting the conclusion that GroES and substrate proteins have, at least partially, distinct binding sites even in the intact GroEL tetradecamer.

Georgopoulos C.P. Hendrix R.W. Ellis R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar) are large cylindrical structures that transiently enclose a partially folded polypeptide and allow it to continue folding in a sequestered environment, blocking intermolecular associations between chains during folding. The chaperonin of Escherichia coli, GroEL, belongs to the group I class of chaperonins and has been studied in great detail (e.g. Refs. 5Grallert H. Buchner J. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar and 6Kusmierczyk A.R. Martin J. Mol. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). GroEL interacts with an estimated 10–15% of newly synthesized polypeptides in the bacterial cytosol (7Ewalt K.L. Hendrick J.P. Houry W.A. Hartl F.U.

Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). GroEL is a homotetradecamer of ∼57-kDa subunits that are arranged as two heptameric rings stacked back-to-back (9Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar, 10Roseman A.M. Chen S.X. White H. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). GroEL requires the presence of a co-chaperone, GroES, together with a controlled cycle of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, to complete its functional cycle (1Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar,11Feltham J.L. Gierasch L.M.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 581-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). GroES is a single heptameric ring of identical ∼10-kDa subunits that binds in a nucleotide-dependent manner to one end of the GroEL cylinder. A substrate protein binds with highest affinity to the nucleotide-free state of GroEL (reviewed in Ref. 1Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). On subsequent binding of 7 ATP and GroES, the substrate protein is jettisoned into a cis-folding cage where it is free to fold to its final native form. Whereas the nucleotide-coupled interplay between GroEL, GroES, and protein substrate is understood in great detail, precisely how GroEL binds a wide array of non-native proteins and assists their folding remains elusive. Each GroEL subunit consists of an equatorial, an apical, and an intermediate domain (9Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar, 10Roseman A.M. Chen S.X. White H. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The equatorial domains of the subunits contain the ATP-binding site and both the N and C termini; they also mediate most inter-subunit contacts within and between rings. The apical domains form the entrance to the GroEL cavity and contain the residues involved in protein and GroES binding (13Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Each intermediate domain forms a hinge-like connector between the equatorial and apical domains of that subunit. Studies of polypeptide recognition by GroEL using various techniques (reviewed in Ref. 14Coyle J.E. Jaeger J. Grob M. Robinson C.V. Radford S.E. Fold and Des. 1997; 2: R93-R104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) suggest that the binding site involves the apical domains; more recent crystallographic studies suggest that helices H and I within the apical domain form the substrate-binding site (15Smote A.L.

Biol. 2000; 302: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these helices are the least well defined regions in the GroEL crystal structure and have relatively high thermal parameters (B-factors) even in the isolated apical domain (21Braig K. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 22Buckle A.M. Zahn R. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3571-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the ability of GroEL to bind a diverse range of polypeptides may involve this conformational plasticity. Structural mobility and exposed hydrophobic surfaces are features common to both the apical domains of GroEL and non-native polypeptides. Here we investigate the properties of the apical domain from GroEL and its peptide binding characteristics using a range of analytical techniques. Specifically, the ability of electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to simultaneously observe different protein conformations in solution was exploited to study the conformational dynamics of the GroEL apical domain and the ability of different conformers to bind peptide mimics of the co-chaperone GroES and the substrate protein, rhodanese. Parallel fluorescence emission studies were used to study these complexes and compare the binding properties of the apical domain constructs for each peptide with those of intact GroEL. The data suggest that the apical domain possesses different binding sites for the peptides in that no competition for binding individual peptides to the apical domain was observed. Finally, using surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence studies on a GroEL variant in which the GroES-binding groove is blocked by a covalently bound peptide, we show that the substrate and the GroEL mobile loop-binding sites are at least partially distinct even in the intact GroEL tetradecamer. The apical domain constructs: ApEL1(GroEL-(191–376)), N-His ApEL (GroEL-(191–376) containing an N-terminal hexahistidine tag), C-His ApEL (GroEL-(188–381) containing a C-terminal hexahistidine tag), and ApTrap (ApEL G337S/I349E) were cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously (23Weber F.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 200-201Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The concentration of all apical domain constructs was determined using an extinction coefficient of 4260 m−1cm−1 at 280 nm, calculated by the method of Pace et al. (25Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). Wild-type GroEL and EL N229C (intact GroEL containing the mutation N229C and in which all the endogenous cysteine residues have been exchanged for alanine) were purified as described previously (26Brinker A.

All crystallization screens were performed by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method at 18 °C. Sparse matrix screens were used to perform initial crystallization trials in 24-well plates with a well volume of 500 μl (27Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2079) Google Scholar). Lyophilized C-His ApEL was dissolved in, and extensively dialyzed against, buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.2) prior to screening. The final protein solution was 10 mg ml−1. Hanging drops contained equal volumes (2 μl each) of the protein and well solutions. Crystals of C-His ApEL were obtained after 1–2 weeks with a well solution of 0.6 m NaCl, 14% (w/v) PEG 6000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Crystals of C-His ApEL were transferred to a solution of mother liquor containing 15% (v/v) glycerol as a cryoprotectant and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. X-ray data were collected using a 30-cm MAR Research image plate detector at the Synchrotron Radiation Source Station 9.6 (Daresbury, UK) (λ = 0.87 Å). Indexing and extraction of the raw x-ray intensities were performed using the program MOSFLM (28Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter Protein Crystallography. 26.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement was carried out with the program AMORE (30Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Initial model building was carried out with the program FRODO (31Pflugrath J.W. Saper M.A. Quiocho F.A. Hall S. Ashira T.

The N terminus was modified with either an acetyl or dansyl group, the latter to provide a sensitive fluorescent probe for monitoring binding to the apical domain. The purity and molecular masses of the peptides were verified by analysis of a 10 ng μl−1 solution in 1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.05% aqueous formic acid using positive ionization ESI-MS. The concentrations of dansylated peptides were determined using the extinction coefficient for a single dansyl group of 4500m−1 cm−1 at 330 nm (38Hutchinson J.P. Oldham T.C. Elthaher T.S.H. Miller A.D. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1997; 2: 279-288Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The concentrations of non-dansylated peptides were estimated by dry weight. The apical domain constructs were analyzed at a concentration of 20 μm by continuous infusion at a flow rate of 5 μl min−1 into the electrospray ionization source of a Platform II (Micromass UK Ltd., Manchester, United Kingdom) single quadrupole mass spectrometer using a syringe pump (model 22, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Where “native” electrospray conditions were used, the samples were dissolved in ammonium acetate (50 mm) at pH 7.5. Where “denaturing” electrospray conditions were used, the samples were analyzed in 1:1 (v/v) 0.1% aqueous formic acid, acetonitrile. In both cases the ionization source was maintained at 30 °C and nitrogen was employed as both the nebulizing and drying gases at flow rates of 20 and 200 l h−1, respectively. Positive ionization electrospray was used with a capillary voltage of 2.3 kV, the counter electrode set at 0 kV, and the sampling cone at 30 V. Data were acquired over the range m/z 500–3000 at a scan speed of 10 s and processed using MassLynx software (Micromass UK Ltd.). An external calibration using horse heart myoglobin (molecular mass 16,951.5 Da; Sigma) was applied to ensure mass accuracy. The m/z spectra displayed were smoothed mildly using a Sovitzy-Golay algorithm. The molecular mass (zero charge state) profiles illustrated were generated from the m/zspectra using the Maximum Entropy (39Ferrige A.G. Seddon M.J. Green B.N. Jarvis S.A. Skilling J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 6: 707-711Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar) software supplied with MassLynx. To determine the thermal stability of the apical domain constructs, the ionization source temperature was raised in a stepwise fashion from 30–190 °C. The apical domain was mixed with the peptides HD or ML in ammonium acetate (50 mm) at pH 7.5 and the mixtures were incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature prior to ESI-MS analysis. The concentration of the apical domain was maintained at a constant 20 μm although the concentration of ML was varied from 1 to 200 μm and the concentration of HD was maintained at 50 μm to maximize the proportion of the complex without incurring problems with aggregation. The ionization source temperature was maintained at 30 °C and the sampling cone voltage at 30 V; these conditions were chosen to preserve protein-peptide complexation. N-Hydroxysuccinimido maleoyl-β-alaninate (Mal>β-Ala-OSu) was prepared following a previously published procedure (40Romano R. Bayerl T.M. Moroder L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The precursor peptide Ac-SWMTTPWGFLHP (the so-called strong-binding peptide, SBP (19Chen L.L. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 99: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar)) was synthesized with an automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 430A) using standard Fmoc/tBu chemistry on pre-loaded Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-2-chlorotritylresin (loading: 0.62 mmol g−1, 194 mg, 0.12 mmol). After cleavage and deprotection of the peptide with 95:2:3 (v/v/v) trifluoroacetic acid:water:triisopropyl silane and precipitation with methyl t-butylether, the precipitate was dissolved in 4:1 (v/v) t-butanol:water and lyophilized to produce a yield of 162 mg. The crude product (62 mg) was dissolved inN, N-dimethylformamide (20 ml) and reacted overnight with Mal>β-Ala-OSu (10.5 mg) and diisopropylethylamine (20.3 μl). After evaporation, the residue was dissolved in 4:1 (v/v) t-butanol:water and lyophilized. The resulting product was purified on a NucleosilTM C18 column using a linear gradient of 30–80% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile in 60 min. The product-containing fractions were pooled and the solution was dried. The residue was dissolved in 4:1 (v/v) t-butanol:water and lyophilized to yield 12 mg of 98% pure material as verified by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis. A ∼3-fold molar excess of SBP-Mal over EL N229C cysteines was applied to achieve quantitative modification. SBP-Mal (10 mm in Me2SO) was diluted 20-fold with H2O. 200 μl of EL N229C (to give a final concentration 9 μm) was added to 1 ml of 0.5 mm peptide solution and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol (50 mm) and excess reagent was removed by gel filtration chromatography. Less than 10% free thiols were detected in EL N229C:SBP-Mal on treatment with maleimidosalicylic acid. Denatured rhodanese (100 μm in 6 m guanidinium chloride) was diluted 200-fold into buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) in the absence or presence of 1.0 μm EL N229C or EL N229C:SBP-Mal. Rhodanese aggregation was followed by turbidity measurements at 320 nm. Steady state fluorescence emission was measured at 20 °C on a spectrofluorimeter (model LS50B, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a 1-cm path length. Protein-peptide complexes were equilibrated for 5 min prior to acquiring fluorescence emission spectra. Fluorescence emission scans of dansylated peptides were recorded between 450 and 600 nm, using an excitation wavelength of 350 nm and a scan speed of 60 nm min−1. Excitation and emission slit widths were typically between 5 and 10 nm. Peptide binding titrations were performed with similar parameters but in the time drive mode, measuring emission at a single wavelength. The emission wavelength used was 500 nm for HD and 535 nm for ML binding to ApEL, respectively. All titrations were performed by adding small volumes of the dansyl-ML or ApEL to a cuvette containing 2–3 ml of either ApEL (25 mm) or dansyl-HD (3 mm), respectively, in buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT). After each addition, the solution was mixed thoroughly and allowed to equilibrate thermally for ∼5 min. Titration of ApEL with the dansyl-ML required ∼25-min equilibration times. The total volume of ligand added never exceeded 10% of the total volume. For each assay, a control experiment was performed by adding the ligand to a solution of buffer alone and was subtracted from the corresponding reading acquired in the presence of protein or peptide. All peptide binding curves were fitted using the program GrafitTM (Erithacus Software Ltd.). Single transition ligand-binding profiles were fitted with either a weak (Equation 1) or tight (Equation 2) ligand binding equation as appropriate (41Ranson N.A. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Typically, the weak binding equation was used under conditions where the dissociation constant was greater than the concentration of binding sites and the tight ligand binding equation was used under conditions where the concentration of binding sites was much greater than the dissociation constant.

Martin J. Hartl F.U. Science. 1995; 269: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Binding was followed using buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 nm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP) at a flow rate of 20 μl min−1 at 25 °C. The concentration of GroEL was 250 nm. Various GroEL apical domain fragments, mainly spanning amino acids 191–376 (with or without a hexahistidine tag) were expressed and purified for these studies (Fig.1A). ApTrap contains two point mutations in GroEL-(191–376): G337S and I349E, which in intact wild-type (WT) GroEL result in loss of ability of GroEL to release bound polypeptide (13Fenton W.A. Kashi Y.

Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Additionally, C-His ApEL is a slightly larger apical domain construct, encompassing residues GroEL-(188–381), containing a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Several crystal structures of GroEL apical domains have been obtained to date (9Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B.

To compare the structure of these domains with that of the larger construct C-His ApEL constructed here, crystals of C-His ApEL were grown as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Crystals appeared within 1–2 weeks and belong to space groupP212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 48.6 Å, b = 61.9 Å, and c = 75.2 Å. A 98.8% complete data set was collected at cryogenic temperatures from a single crystal to 2.06-Å resolution. The molecular replacement procedure revealed a clear solution in both the rotation and translation searches. The correlation coefficient corresponding to the highest peak in the translation function was 0.600 and the initial R-factor after rigid-body optimization was 0.387 (47Brunger A.T. Kurijan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the apical domain fragment, C-His ApEL (residues 188–381), is well defined. The free R of the final refined model is 0.257 including 95% of all data between 20 and 2.06 Å. In the current model the deviations in ideal bond lengths and bond angles were 0.011 Å and 2.4°, respectively, and the average real-space correlation coefficient for all amino acid residues was 0.936. The backbone torsion angles of all residues are within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (data not shown).

In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the components of many nucleoprotein complexes containing DNA loops have been characterized, but higher order structures are largely unknown. Questions such as the characteristic modes by which DNA loops form and the way in which the abundant architectural components of the nucleoid contribute to DNA loops remain to be resolved (3Tsodikov O.V.

The Gal repressosome containing a DNA loop is one such complex whose function is to represses the transcription of the genes for galactose metabolism in Escherichia coli(7Aki T. Adhya S. EMBO J. 1997; 12: 3666-3674Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 8Lewis D. Geanacopoulos M. Adhya S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9Geanacopoulos M. Vasmatzis G. Lewis D.E.A. Roy S. Lee B. Adhya S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Its assembly requires (i) the binding of two dimeric GalR repressors to two operators flanking the two galpromoters, (ii) the cooperative binding of HU, an abundant component of the nucleoid to a site between the two operators, and (iii) negatively supercoiled DNA. Fig. 1a shows the galregulatory region. In our attempts to understand the structure of theGal repressosome, we have adopted a genetic approach, which we hope will complement the structural studies and provide critical in vivo information on how the repressosome forms. In this report, we present the results of homology-based site-directed mutagenesis and alanine scanning of the GalR surface as well as allele-specific suppression genetics to characterize the domains of GalR dimers that interact to form a tetramer while bound to DNA. The results confirm that repressosome formation involves several residues on the DNA-distal edge of the GalR dimer that make critical contacts in the higher order complex. The strains and plasmids used in this study have been previously described with one exception (8Lewis D. Geanacopoulos M. Adhya S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The galP2∼gusA reporter fusion, in whichOE is deleted, was constructed by two rounds of PCR amplification. A primer, which completely replacedOE, and a primer complementary to the sequence upstream of the EcoR1 site in pI24 (8Lewis D. Geanacopoulos M. Adhya S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) were used to amplify the DNA upstream of the operator, and the complement to the mutagenic primer and a primer complementary to galE were used to amplify the downstream sequence including the HindIII site in galE. These PCR products were annealed and amplified with the primers complementary to the ends of the annealed DNA, and the product was cloned into pSA817. The resulting gene fusion was transferred to the chromosome using bacteriophage λ as reported previously (8Lewis D. Geanacopoulos M. Adhya S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The effect of site-directed mutations on GalR function was examined in vivo by the enzyme assay of two gene fusions that enable the DNA binding activity of a GalR mutant to be measured separately from its ability to form the repressosome. GalR binding to the upstream gal operatorOE is sufficient for the repression of P1(8Lewis D. Geanacopoulos M. Adhya S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Choy H.E. Hanger R. Aki T. Mahoney M. Murakami K. Ishihama A. Adhya S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) but not P2. Therefore, a gene fusion was constructed in which the gal promoter is mutated to inactivateP2 while retaining P1 transcription and fused to the lacZ gene, such that OI is deleted (Fig. 1c). Therefore, LacZ expression is an indicator of the occupancy of OE by GalR. To measure the extent of repressosome formation, the gal promoter is mutated so that transcription occurs only from P2 and is joined to the gusA reporter downstream ofOI (Fig. 1b). β-Glucuronidase or β-galactosidase activities were measured for all cultures simultaneously using the SoftmaxTM microplate spectrophotometer system. The values for expression of lacZand gusA reporter fusions were normalized to the value obtained in a corresponding ΔgalR strain. The mean ± S.E. for values given for P1∼lacZ fusions was 7%, and the mean ± S.E. for P2∼gusA expression was ∼3%. This error derives from the uncertainty associated with best straight line fit of a plot of four measurements of enzyme activity versuscell density in a growing culture as well as the uncertainty associated with the best fit of enzyme activity versus A600 for the ΔgalR strain. The mutant activity is divided by the activity in theΔgalR strain and the error propagated accordingly. Site-directed mutagenesis of galR was performed with the QuikChangeTM kit from Stratagene. All of the mutants were sequenced by standard methods. Potential suppressors of looping-defective GalR mutants were generated by adding a mixture of bases at the first two positions of a given codon. The positions at which the suppressors were screened were chosen on the basis of trying to include all or most of the substitution-sensitive residues at an interface among apposed GalR dimers. Potential suppressors of the GalR mutants N259M and D258N were screened by introducing substitutions at positions 322, 325, and 327. In the case of R325H, potential random substitutions at 258 and 230 were made. For each amino acid pair, ∼50 clones were screened for reduced expression. Positive clones were then assayed as described above to generate a plot of enzyme activityversus cell density. We previously described how by homology-scanning mutagenesis we identified surfaces of GalR that participated in repressosome formation (11Geanacopoulos M. Vasmatzis G. Zhurkin V.B. Adhya S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this approach, a homology model of the dimeric GalR core was constructed based on the structures of two proteins, LacI and PurR, that have high sequence similarity to GalR and are nearly identical in their crystal structures (9Geanacopoulos M. Vasmatzis G. Lewis D.E.A. Roy S. Lee B. Adhya S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G.

The particular residues that were substituted into GalR were those that occupied corresponding structural positions in either LacI or PurR when the GalR model was superimposed on the crystal structures. This strategy allowed us to change the GalR surface with a minimal likelihood of disrupting the overall structure of the protein (14Bordo D. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The effect of homology-based site-directed mutagenesis of GalR on repressosome formation was examined in vivo as described under “Experimental Procedures” by the enzyme assay of two gene fusion products that enable the DNA binding activity of a GalR mutant to be measured separately from its ability to form the higher order structure (9Geanacopoulos M. Vasmatzis G. Lewis D.E.A. Roy S. Lee B. Adhya S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). DNA looping was assayed in looping-defective mutants of GalR by measuring the expression of β-glucuronidase from a P2∼gusA fusion whose repression requires repressosome formation (Fig.1b). The assay in the same cell of the level of β-galactosidase synthesized from aP1∼lacZ reporter (Fig. 1c) allowed the DNA binding activity of GalR mutants to be determined so that looping defects attributed to the loss of operator affinity could be eliminated. Table I shows a list of GalR substitutions that either behave like wild type or are specifically defective in repressosome formation. The list comprises the new mutants reported here as well as the previously described ones (11Geanacopoulos M. Vasmatzis G. Zhurkin V.B. Adhya S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) for the purpose of constructing Fig.2 as explained below. For each GalR mutant, we show the level of galP2 expression as a percent of that which is observed in the ΔgalR strain. None of the substitutions listed the exhibited DNA binding defects (data not shown). Those mutants that are not homology-scanning substitutions are denoted in Table I and were generated by site-directed mutagenesis to further analyze some of the residue positions located in the area of the putative interacting surface discussed below. Fig. 2shows the modeled structure of operator-bound GalR in three different views: (a) “side” view with the DNA in the plane of the figure; (b) “bottom” view with the DNA rotated 90 degrees along its axis as indicated, and (c) “front” view in which the DNA axis is orthogonal to the plane of the figure. In the figure, the positions of the substitutions in the GalR dimer structure are color-coded according to their effects on DNA looping. The green spheres show the position of β-carbons that could be substituted with no apparent effect on loop formation (Table I, first group). The red spheres indicate that substitutions at these positions disrupted the looping-dependent repression ofP2 (Table I, second group). It is clear that the sensitive (red) residues are confined to a “crescent” in the roughly planar surface as delineated by a red border in thefront (Fig. 2c) of the carboxyl-terminal subdomain of the core. None is located on the exposed surface on theside (Fig. 2a) or bottom (Fig.2b) of the dimer.Table IEffect of amino acid substitutions on P2 repression by GalR1-aThe table is divided into three groups.

Open table in a new tab The results of our site-directed mutagenesis suggested that a surface on the large face of the carboxyl-terminal subdomain of the GalR core was the site of protein-protein contacts in the repressosome. But some of these substitutions, particularly those with bulky side chains, may cause “interference” rather than loss of interactions in the interface. It has been proposed that the substitution of alanine on the protein surface is a way of abolishing critical contacts among residues without disrupting structure or making new contacts among residues (15Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). We made 10 alanine substitutions (Table I, third group) spanning the crescent-shaped substitution-sensitive surface (Fig. 2c reproduced in Fig.3a) of GalR. The substitution with alanine of only 5 of the 10 residues (Arg-236, Asn-259, Asp-258, Thr-322, and Arg-325) caused derepression of P2. This result and the fact that these residues appear to be extremely sensitive to other kinds of substitutions as well suggest that noncovalent bonds made by these amino acid side chains stabilize the repressosome. The β-carbons at these positions are depicted asyellow spheres in Fig. 3b. To test whether the amino acids identified above participate in GalR tetramerization, we attempted to identify pairs of amino acids that might interact at the interface between two dimers by allele-specific intragenic suppression analysis. Under the assumption that it is the alanine substitution-sensitive amino acids that interact at the interface between GalR dimers, we chose eight potential interacting pairs (listed under “Experimental Procedures”) based on modeling studies (11Geanacopoulos M. Vasmatzis G. Zhurkin V.B. Adhya S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Starting with one mutation, which impaired DNA looping by GalR, we screened for restoration of the ability of GalR to repressP2 among a collection of mutants that also contained randomly generated amino acid substitutions at the second position of the pair. We reasoned that obtaining a substitution that increased repression only when made in a specific looping-defective GalR mutant would be more likely if the two residues that were replaced were interacting with each other in a tetrameric structure. The positive results of the suppressor screens are summarized in TableII. The substitution at position 325 of leucine or valine for arginine in GalR mutant D258N restored repression moderately so that the level of P2 expression decreased from 70 to 53% or 60%, respectively. However, in this case when the same second-site substitutions were made in the wild type protein or the looping-defective mutant E230K, they caused significant derepression. These results suggest that arginine 325 and aspartate 258, the two amino acids whose replacements on their own caused pronounced derepression, may be in close proximity and constitute an interacting pair in the interface among the GalR dimers in the repressosome. The β-carbons of the interacting pair are shown inorange spheres in Fig. 3d.Table IIAllele-specific repression GalR mutant D258N2-agalP2 expression as a percent of that obtained in the absence of GalR.wtD258NE230KNone57222R325L255350R325V95940T322STOP101141V324STOP3550S328STOP1060S330STOP1275wt, wild type.2-a galP2 expression as a percent of that obtained in the absence of GalR. Open table in a new tab wt, wild type. We also found that introducing a stop codon in the D258N mutant at position 322 thereby removing 22 C-terminal amino acids restored repression. In this case, P2 expression was nearly reduced to that seen with wild type protein (Table II). In contrast, the truncation of wild type GalR protein or GalR mutant E230K at position 322 caused relative derepression (Table II). More limited deletions at the C terminus of D258N were made to determine which residues needed to be removed to restore repression. The termination of D258N at residue 330 had no effect, but termination at position 328 moderately restored repression by D258N, whereas it caused a slight derepression ofP2 in the wild type protein. Removing residues 324–343 in D258N restored repression somewhat better and caused much greater derepression in the wild type. Residues 322–328 form a strand of exposed residues that extends along the large face of the C-terminal subdomain of the dimer (Fig. 2c). The precise role of the strand in repressosome formation remains to be determined. While screening for allele-specific suppressors of looping-defective GalR mutants, we identified substitutions within the substitution-sensitive surface that caused increased P2 repression in comparison to wild type GalR. One such substitution, T322V, was isolated as a suppressor of looping-defective mutant D258N (data not shown), but it did not prove to be specific for this allele. T322V did not show any detectable increase in DNA binding as assayed by β-galactosidase synthesis from the P1 promoter (Fig.4, a and b). Enhanced repression of the P2∼gusA fusions by T322V required both operators. When the mutant or the wild type GalR was introduced into strains containing P2∼gusAfusions lacking either the upstream operator OE or the downstream operator OI (Fig. 1, d ande), no repression was observed (Fig. 4, c andd). Thus, the mutant did not acquire the ability to repress the P2 promoter solely through the occupancy ofOE (10Choy H.E. Hanger R. Aki T. Mahoney M. Murakami K. Ishihama A. Adhya S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or though a roadblock mechanism in which transcription arrests because of GalR binding toOI. 1D. E. A. Lewis and S. Adhya, manuscript in preparation. The mutant GalR protein could form a loop with increased stability if protein-protein interactions between either two GalR dimers or GalR and HU were enhanced. When HU was deleted from the chromosome, the mutant phenotype persisted (Fig. 4e). Although the wild type GalR failed to repress P2 in aΔhupΔAhupB strain, the mutant GalR was still able to repress transcription, albeit more weakly than when HU was present. This would suggest that the enhanced P2 repression was the result of enhanced contacts between the GalR dimers and not a stronger interaction between GalR and HU. An additional GalR mutant, H327N, isolated as a suppressor of the looping defect of D259M had properties similar to T322V. It caused enhanced repression of P2 while remaining unaffected for DNA binding, and the phenotype persisted in the absence of HU. 2S. Semsey and S. Adhya, manuscript in preparation. The amount of repression was indistinguishable from that observed with T322V both in the presence and absence of HU. The substitution of cysteine at position 327 also enhanced P2repression. 3M. Geanacopoulos, unpublished observation. Two homology-scanning substitutions, which disrupted P2repression when made in wild type GalR, P291D, and N259M, were introduced in GalR mutant T322V. The second-site mutations causedP2 derepression both in the presence (Fig. 4f) and absence (Fig. 4g) of HU. This would be expected if the tetramer made by GalR mutant T322V was similar to that of the wild type. As described above, both the residues 322 and 327 are sensitive to alanine substitution. Thus, the in vivo properties of these gain-of-function GalR mutants appear consistent with a model in which the repressosome assembly involves an interaction between apposed GalR dimers mediated in part by these amino acids. The β-carbons of residues 322 and 327 are shown in blue spheres in Fig. 3c. The GalR surface defined by homology-scanning mutagenesis and the interacting residues within this surface as defined by alanine substitution could be the site of contacts between GalR dimers and/or HU and GalR. The alanine-scanning results indicate that five residues defining a DNA-distal surface of the dimer make critical interactions. Two of these surfaces could be brought together in apposed GalR dimers in the partially stacked orientation that is suggested by modeling studies (11Geanacopoulos M. Vasmatzis G. Zhurkin V.B. Adhya S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and that occurs in the x-ray crystal structure of the GalR homolog, LacI (12Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 13Friedman A. Fischmann T.O. Steitz T. Science. 1995; 268: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The isolation and characterization of two second-site intragenic mutations at positions that are sensitive to alanine substitution, which partially suppressed DNA looping-defective mutations in GalR in an allele-specific way, suggested that an interaction between residues 258 and 325 mediates a GalR-GalR interface. Conceivably, in the suppressed mutant, a nonpolar interaction between asparagine 258 and leucine 325 could partially replace an ionic interaction between aspartate 258 and arginine 325 that may occur in the wild type. A partially stacked structure would bring residues 325 and 258 into close proximity. The gain-of-function GalR mutants within this surface, H327N, and T322V caused increased repression both in the presence and absence of HU and were indistinguishable from one another under both conditions. These results also imply that there exists a direct contact between the GalR dimers along the DNA-distal surface. If one assumes on the other hand that in the wild type there is no GalR-GalR contact upon repressosome formation, then each gain-of-function mutation must create an entirely new protein-protein interface that is still stabilized by HU (Fig. 4,a and e). Arguing against this scenario is the fact that repression was lost when the gain-of-function mutations were combined with mutations N259M and P291D that disrupted looping in the wild type protein. The surface that we have defined by mutation spans the C-terminal subdomains of both monomers in the dimer. Crystallographic studies of PurR and LacI indicate that ligand binding does not change the C-terminal subdomain. However, in the case of PurR dimer, a small relative rotation of the two C-terminal subdomains relative to each other has been observed upon ligand (hypoxanthine) binding. If such a rotation was to occur in GalR, then inducer binding could be coupled to GalR-GalR tetramerization. The existence of a GalR-GalR contact does not imply that a specific GalR-HU contact(s) is not formed during repressosome formation. In fact, we have recently presented evidence that an interaction of GalR with a small patch created by three amino acid residues in HU is required for stable repressosome formation by wild type GalR (4Kar S. Adhya S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2273-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The regulation of critical processes in the cell such as transcription, recombination, and replication occurs through the assembly of higher order nucleoprotein complexes, which often entail the formation of DNA loops. Understanding the principles that govern their formation will entail elucidation of structures such as the Gal repressome. The careful characterization of individual structures will allow important general questions to be addressed. For instance, how are abundant architectural components of the bacterial nucleoid characteristically incorporated into the higher order structures? Is there a particular DNA trajectory that is prevalent in the loops? Do nonspecific coulombic interactions of the regulatory proteins with DNA serve to stabilize wrapped structures similar to the eukaryotic nucleosome? Structure-based genetic approaches will serve as useful in vivo adjuncts to physical methods in addressing these issues. In particular, they suggest residues, which can be modified for chemical cross-linking and fluorescence energy transfer experiments, that can elucidate structures, which are difficult to analyze by x-ray crystallography.

Brooks D.E. Knobil E. Neill J.D. Perspectives in Male Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1980: 753-856Google Scholar). If incubated for a brief period of time, semen undergoes a process known as liquefaction that leads to clearing of this fluid and a partial loss of its viscosity (2Sobrero A.J. MacLeod J.K. Fertil. Steril. 1962; 13: 184-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Centrifugation of partially liquefied semen leads to the separation of the cellular components from the viscous acellular fluid known as human seminal plasma (HSP).1HSP is more than simply a liquid medium for transporting sperm into the vagina. It is an extremely complex mixture of proteins, glycoproteins, peptides, glycopeptides, and prostaglandins secreted by the organs of the male reproductive tract (reviewed in Ref. 1Setchell B.P. Brooks D.E. Knobil E. Neill J.D. Perspectives in Male Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1980: 753-856Google Scholar). A plethora of different studies indicate that HSP supports sperm function, modulates maternal immune responses directed against sperm, and promotes successful implantation of the human embryo (reviewed in Refs. 1Setchell B.P. Brooks D.E. Knobil E. Neill J.D. Perspectives in Male Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1980: 753-856Google Scholar, 3Kelly R.W. Critchley H.O. Hum.

The components of HSP may therefore profoundly impact male fertility in the female reproductive tract.Previous studies confirm that HSP contains a specific glycoprotein with immunomodulatory activities (5Bolton A.E. Pockley A.G. Clough K.J. Mowles E.A. Stoker R.J. Westwood O.M. Chapman M.G. Lancet. 1987; 1: 593-595Abstract PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) now known as glycodelin-S (6Morris H.R. Dell A. Easton R.L. Panico M. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Oehninger S. Patankar M.S. Seppala M. Clark G.F. J. Biol.

Glycodelin-S also promotes human sperm binding to homologous zona pellucida in the hemizona assay system (6Morris H.R. Dell A. Easton R.L. Panico M. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Oehninger S. Patankar M.S. Seppala M. Clark G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32159-32167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This intriguing combination of biological activities led us to investigate further the glycosylation of other components associated with HSP. By using fast atom bombardment (FAB) and electrospray (ES) mass spectrometry to screen HSP for novel glycoconjugates (7Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar), we have made the surprising discovery that this fluid is also rich in free oligosaccharides. The only other human secretion known to contain a significant amount of free oligosaccharides is human milk (reviewed in Refs. 8Newburg D.S. Neubauer S.H. Jenson R.G. Handbook of Milk Composition. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 273-349Google Scholar and 9Kunz C. Rudloff S. Baier W. Klein N. Strobel S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 699-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). More than 90 distinct human milk oligosaccharides have been identified. Their structural heterogeneity is derived primarily from differential sialylation, fucosylation, branching, and polylactosamine chain extension (8Newburg D.S. Neubauer S.H. Jenson R.G. Handbook of Milk Composition. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 273-349Google Scholar, 9Kunz C. Rudloff S. Baier W. Klein N. Strobel S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 699-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar).Several significant biological activities have been ascribed to human milk oligosaccharides. For example, many pathogens and bacterial toxins recognize terminal carbohydrate sequences associated with these glycans (reviewed in Ref. 10Newburg D.S. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 117-127PubMed Google Scholar). Thus human milk oligosaccharides may block infection in infants by interfering with crucial adhesion and binding events essential for bacterial colonization and infection. A more recent study suggests that human milk oligosaccharides inhibit the binding of neutrophils activated with tumor necrosis factor to endothelial cells in vitro (9Kunz C. Rudloff S. Baier W. Klein N. Strobel S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 699-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) and thus may modulate inflammatory events in vivo.In this paper, we report the structural characterization of several families of free oligosaccharides present in HSP and show that they share some of the structural characteristics of human milk oligosaccharides, as well as having a number of unique features. The great majority are heavily fucosylated and contain structural motifs also present in the antennae of the N-linked oligosaccharides of glycodelin-S. The potential impact of these unusual free oligosaccharides on male reproductive function is discussed.DISCUSSIONTo our knowledge this study is the first revealing the existence of free oligosaccharides in HSP. Thus both human milk and HSP are secretions that contain free oligosaccharides. However, there are several significant differences between milk and HSP oligosaccharides revealed by the current structural analyses: (i) the concentration of free oligosaccharides is greater in human milk than HSP (5–8versus 0.3–0.4 mg/ml) (9Kunz C. Rudloff S. Baier W. Klein N. Strobel S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 699-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar); (ii) sialylated oligosaccharides are very minor components in HSP (data not shown) but represent 25–30% of the total human milk glycans (15Smith D.F. Zopf D.A. Ginsburg V. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); (iii) the majority of complex HSP oligosaccharides are fucosylated; (iv) a subset of HSP oligosaccharides express the reducing end sequence (GlcNAcβ1–3/4Glc) not reported in human milk oligosaccharides; (v) HSP oligosaccharides exclusively express type 2 (Galβ1–4GlcNAc) but not the type 1 sequences (Galβ1–3GlcNAc) that predominate in human milk oligosaccharides (9Kunz C. Rudloff S. Baier W. Klein N. Strobel S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 699-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar); and (vi) the structural diversity of human milk oligosaccharides greatly exceeds that of HSP oligosaccharides (16Stahl B. Thurl S. Zeng J. Karas M. Hillenkamp F. Steup M. Sawatzki G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).The pathway for the synthesis of HSP and human milk oligosaccharides may share some common features, however. β-Galactosyltransferase and α-fucosyltransferase activities associated with free oligosaccharide synthesis are present in human milk (17Nagasawa T. Kiyosawa I. Tanahashi N. J. Dairy Sci. 1971; 54: 835-841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 18Grollman E.F. Kobata A. Ginsburg V. J. Clin. Invest. 1969; 48: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similar enzymatic activities are also present in HSP (19Tadolini B. Wilson T.J. Reddy P.R. Williams-Ashman H.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1976; 15: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Ross P. Vigneault N. Provencher S. Potier M. Roberts K.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 98: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The properties of the HSP-associated galactosyltransferase include the following: (i) sensitivity to α-lactalbumin (20Ross P. Vigneault N. Provencher S. Potier M. Roberts K.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 98: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), a modifier protein in mammalian milk (21Brodbeck U. Ebner K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 762-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that shifts the substrate acceptor specificity of breast milk galactosyltransferase from GlcNAc to Glc (22Brew K. Vanaman T.C. Hill R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar); (ii) origin primarily in the prostate and epididymis (19Tadolini B. Wilson T.J. Reddy P.R. Williams-Ashman H.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1976; 15: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Ross P. Vigneault N. Provencher S. Potier M. Roberts K.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 98: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); and (iii) androgen dependence (20Ross P. Vigneault N. Provencher S. Potier M. Roberts K.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 98: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A possible functional linkage is the observation that human sperm penetration through cervical mucus is positively correlated with this HSP-associated β-galactosyltransferase activity (23Ronquist G. Stegmayr B. Andren C. Wikstrom K. Urol. Int. 1985; 40: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar).Another interesting finding is that the level of HSP-associated α-fucosyltransferase activity greatly exceeds the β-galactosyltransferase activity in vitro (24Ronquist G. Urol. Int. 1987; 42: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with the content of fucosylated oligosaccharides present in HSP. This α-fucosyltransferase activity originates primarily in the prostate and is also androgen-dependent (25Ronquist G. Stegmayr B. Urol. Res. 1984; 12: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).There is currently no evidence suggesting that other mammalian species express free oligosaccharides in their seminal plasma. However, there are data supporting the existence of glycosyltransferases and associated biosynthetic proteins in rat seminal plasma. Both a substantial β-galactosyltransferase activity and an α-lactalbumin homologue are present in rat seminal plasma (26Hamilton D.W. Biol. Reprod. 1981; 25: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Rat seminal plasma also contains very substantial amounts of α-fucosyltransferase activity (27Tulsiani D.R. Orgebin-Crist M.C. Skudlarek M.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1998; 53 (suppl.): 85-97Google Scholar). These enzymes are postulated to function in the modification of sperm-surface glycoproteins (27Tulsiani D.R. Orgebin-Crist M.C. Skudlarek M.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1998; 53 (suppl.): 85-97Google Scholar), but based on the current evidence such enzymes could be involved in free oligosaccharide synthesis.The function of HSP oligosaccharides in the male and/or the female reproductive systems is unknown. Because humans do not inject semen directly into the uterus, sperm and other seminal plasma components must traverse the cervical mucin plug to enter this organ (reviewed in Ref. 28Gipson I.K. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D1245-D1255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It may be easier for smaller components like free oligosaccharides to move through this plug at midcycle to influence events within the uterus and the oviduct. Support of sperm function in the uterus and oviduct would certainly be physiologically relevant. Of the several million sperm present in human semen, at most a few hundred arrive in the ampulla of the oviduct where fertilization takes place (reviewed in Ref. 1Setchell B.P. Brooks D.E. Knobil E. Neill J.D. Perspectives in Male Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1980: 753-856Google Scholar). Indeed, a very great mystery is how natural fertilization occurs in the presence of such low concentrations of sperm compared with those required for successful in vitro fertilization or sperm binding assays. The logical reason is that male and female factors operating within the vagina and oviduct facilitate this process.Possible supportive effects of free oligosaccharides on sperm function include the following: (i) increasing sperm longevity by delaying hyperactivation; (ii) modifying sperm motion parameters that increase fertility, especially progressive motility; and (iii) promoting sperm binding to eggs.Human sperm display decreased hyperactivation and increased progressive motility following exposure to human cervical mucinsin vitro (29Eriksen G.V. Carlstedt I. Uldbjerg N. Ernst E. Fertil. Steril. 1998; 70: 350-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The major O-glycans associated with human midcycle cervical mucins are terminated with Lewisx and Lewisy sequences (30Yurewicz E.C. Matsuura F. Moghissi K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2314-2322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as are HSP oligosaccharides. Human sperm binding to the zona pellucida is increased by 20% in the hemizona assay in the presence of fucose (1 mg/ml) but not other monosaccharides (31Oehninger S. Acosta A. Hodgen G.D. Fertil. Steril. 1990; 53: 143-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, glycodelin-S, a HSP glycoprotein also terminated with Lewisx and Lewisy sequences, increases sperm binding in the hemizona assay by 50% at physiological concentrations (6Morris H.R. Dell A. Easton R.L. Panico M. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Oehninger S. Patankar M.S. Seppala M. Clark G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32159-32167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The expression of fucosylated sequences on free oligosaccharides, mucins, and glycoproteins may promote sperm-egg binding in the human oviduct.The oligosaccharides associated with HSP could also play a pivotal role in blocking immune/inflammatory cell reactions in the male and female reproductive systems. Except for sperm, leukocytes are the most prevalent cell type present in HSP from fertile males. These leukocytes are primarily neutrophils, with lower numbers of monocytes and T cells (reviewed in Ref. 32Wolff H. Fertil. Steril. 1995; 63: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Leukocytospermia is a condition characterized by excessive numbers of leukocytes in semen (reviewed in Ref. 33Aitken R.J. Baker H.W. Hum. Reprod. 1995; 10: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Elevation in leukocytes above a certain threshold is associated with male infertility (32Wolff H. Fertil. Steril. 1995; 63: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also a very profound influx of leukocytes into the vagina and cervix following intercourse, an event referred to as the leukocyte reaction (34Thompson L.A. Barratt C.L. Bolton A.E. Cooke I.D. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1992; 28: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The majority of the invasive cells are neutrophils, with minor amounts of natural killer cells and monocytes (34Thompson L.A. Barratt C.L. Bolton A.E. Cooke I.D. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1992; 28: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Human sperm express carbohydrate sequences that are recognized by natural killer cells (35Patankar M.S. Ozgur K. Oehninger S. Dell A. Morris H. Seppala M. Clark G.F. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 3: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), so they are likely protected from this type of lymphocyte. However, the factors protecting sperm from other immune and inflammatory cell types in semen and the uterus are not very well defined.There is some good evidence that prostate vesicles (prostasomes) present in HSP scavenge reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils and monocytes (36Saez F. Motta C. Boucher D. Grizard G. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 4: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, prostasomes may protect sperm from the toxic by-products of neutrophil metabolism. Other investigators suggest that prostaglandins (PGE2 and 19-hydroxy-PGE) present in HSP play a crucial role in the suppression of leukocytes (3Kelly R.W. Critchley H.O. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 12: 2200-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, incubation of the neutrophil model cell line U937 with a seminal plasma fraction enriched in PGE2 and 19-hydroxy-PGE had no effect on the release of the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 at the highest concentration tested (0.1% of the seminal plasma concentration) (37Denison F.C. Grant V.E. Calder A.A. Kelly R.W. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1999; 5: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). By contrast, incubation of U937 cells with media containing HSP diluted to the same extent induces substantial interleukin-10 release from U937 cells (37Denison F.C. Grant V.E. Calder A.A. Kelly R.W. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1999; 5: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This result implies that other components within HSP are likely responsible for the major suppressive effect of this secretion. One factor implicated in this immunomodulation is glycodelin-S, a glycoprotein that shares terminal Lewisx and Lewisy sequences with the HSP oligosaccharides (6Morris H.R. Dell A. Easton R.L. Panico M. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Oehninger S. Patankar M.S. Seppala M. Clark G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32159-32167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).Human milk oligosaccharides block the binding of many pathogens or their toxins to colonic epithelial cells in vitro (reviewed in Refs. 9Kunz C. Rudloff S. Baier W. Klein N. Strobel S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 699-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar and 10Newburg D.S. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 117-127PubMed Google Scholar). Several of these crucial interactions are inhibited by fucosylated oligosaccharides present in this secretion. HSP oligosaccharides could also block infection with pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections. Fucosylated glycans have been implicated in infection with human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type I, and human immunodeficiency virus (38Zacharopoulos V.R. Phillips D.M. Microb. Pathog. 1997; 23: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39Ushijima H. Schroder H.C. Poznanovic S. Matthes E. Muller W.E. Res. Virol. 1992; 143: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Additional study will be required to determine whether HSP oligosaccharides confer any protective effect against pathogens in the male and/or female reproductive systems.In summary, free oligosaccharides of highly restricted sequence heterogeneity are expressed in the HSP of fertile men. The presence of a predominant modification of the complex glycans (fucosylation) suggests potential functional significance especially when linked to previous data collected in the human model. Further investigation will be required to define the precise physiological roles of these free oligosaccharides in human reproduction. Human semen contains a variety of different cell types including sperm, neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes (reviewed in Ref. 1Setchell B.P. Brooks D.E. Knobil E. Neill J.D. Perspectives in Male Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1980: 753-856Google Scholar). If incubated for a brief period of time, semen undergoes a process known as liquefaction that leads to clearing of this fluid and a partial loss of its viscosity (2Sobrero A.J. MacLeod J.K. Fertil. Steril. 1962; 13: 184-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Centrifugation of partially liquefied semen leads to the separation of the cellular components from the viscous acellular fluid known as human seminal plasma (HSP).1 HSP is more than simply a liquid medium for transporting sperm into the vagina. It is an extremely complex mixture of proteins, glycoproteins, peptides, glycopeptides, and prostaglandins secreted by the organs of the male reproductive tract (reviewed in Ref. 1Setchell B.P. Brooks D.E. Knobil E. Neill J.D. Perspectives in Male Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1980: 753-856Google Scholar). A plethora of different studies indicate that HSP supports sperm function, modulates maternal immune responses directed against sperm, and promotes successful implantation of the human embryo (reviewed in Refs. 1Setchell B.P. Brooks D.E. Knobil E. Neill J.D. Perspectives in Male Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1980: 753-856Google Scholar, 3Kelly R.W. Critchley H.O. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 12: 2200-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, and 4Robertson S.A. Sharkey D.J. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The components of HSP may therefore profoundly impact male fertility in the female reproductive tract. Previous studies confirm that HSP contains a specific glycoprotein with immunomodulatory activities (5Bolton A.E. Pockley A.G. Clough K.J. Mowles E.A. Stoker R.J. Westwood O.M. Chapman M.G. Lancet. 1987; 1: 593-595Abstract PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) now known as glycodelin-S (6Morris H.R. Dell A. Easton R.L. Panico M. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Oehninger S. Patankar M.S. Seppala M. Clark G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32159-32167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Glycodelin-S also promotes human sperm binding to homologous zona pellucida in the hemizona assay system (6Morris H.R. Dell A. Easton R.L. Panico M. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Oehninger S. Patankar M.S. Seppala M. Clark G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32159-32167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This intriguing combination of biological activities led us to investigate further the glycosylation of other components associated with HSP. By using fast atom bombardment (FAB) and electrospray (ES) mass spectrometry to screen HSP for novel glycoconjugates (7Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar), we have made the surprising discovery that this fluid is also rich in free oligosaccharides. The only other human secretion known to contain a significant amount of free oligosaccharides is human milk (reviewed in Refs. 8Newburg D.S. Neubauer S.H. Jenson R.G. Handbook of Milk Composition. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 273-349Google Scholar and 9Kunz C. Rudloff S. Baier W. Klein N. Strobel S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 699-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). More than 90 distinct human milk oligosaccharides have been identified. Their structural heterogeneity is derived primarily from differential sialylation, fucosylation, branching, and polylactosamine chain extension (8Newburg D.S. Neubauer S.H. Jenson R.G. Handbook of Milk Composition. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 273-349Google Scholar, 9Kunz C. Rudloff S. Baier W. Klein N. Strobel S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 699-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Several significant biological activities have been ascribed to human milk oligosaccharides. For example, many pathogens and bacterial toxins recognize terminal carbohydrate sequences associated with these glycans (reviewed in Ref. 10Newburg D.S. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 117-127PubMed Google Scholar). Thus human milk oligosaccharides may block infection in infants by interfering with crucial adhesion and binding events essential for bacterial colonization and infection. A more recent study suggests that human milk oligosaccharides inhibit the binding of neutrophils activated with tumor necrosis factor to endothelial cells in vitro (9Kunz C. Rudloff S. Baier W. Klein N. Strobel S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 699-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) and thus may modulate inflammatory events in vivo. In this paper, we report the structural characterization of several families of free oligosaccharides present in HSP and show that they share some of the structural characteristics of human milk oligosaccharides, as well as having a number of unique features. The great majority are heavily fucosylated and contain structural motifs also present in the antennae of the N-linked oligosaccharides of glycodelin-S. The potential impact of these unusual free oligosaccharides on male reproductive function is discussed. DISCUSSIONTo our knowledge this study is the first revealing the existence of free oligosaccharides in HSP. Thus both human milk and HSP are secretions that contain free oligosaccharides. However, there are several significant differences between milk and HSP oligosaccharides revealed by the current structural analyses: (i) the concentration of free oligosaccharides is greater in human milk than HSP (5–8versus 0.3–0.4 mg/ml) (9Kunz C. Rudloff S. Baier W. Klein N. Strobel S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 699-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar); (ii) sialylated oligosaccharides are very minor components in HSP (data not shown) but represent 25–30% of the total human milk glycans (15Smith D.F. Zopf D.A. Ginsburg V. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); (iii) the majority of complex HSP oligosaccharides are fucosylated; (iv) a subset of HSP oligosaccharides express the reducing end sequence (GlcNAcβ1–3/4Glc) not reported in human milk oligosaccharides; (v) HSP oligosaccharides exclusively express type 2 (Galβ1–4GlcNAc) but not the type 1 sequences (Galβ1–3GlcNAc) that predominate in human milk oligosaccharides (9Kunz C. Rudloff S. Baier W. Klein N. Strobel S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 699-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar); and (vi) the structural diversity of human milk oligosaccharides greatly exceeds that of HSP oligosaccharides (16Stahl B. Thurl S. Zeng J. Karas M. Hillenkamp F. Steup M. Sawatzki G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).The pathway for the synthesis of HSP and human milk oligosaccharides may share some common features, however. β-Galactosyltransferase and α-fucosyltransferase activities associated with free oligosaccharide synthesis are present in human milk (17Nagasawa T. Kiyosawa I. Tanahashi N. J. Dairy Sci. 1971; 54: 835-841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 18Grollman E.F. Kobata A. Ginsburg V. J. Clin. Invest. 1969; 48: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similar enzymatic activities are also present in HSP (19Tadolini B. Wilson T.J. Reddy P.R. Williams-Ashman H.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1976; 15: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Ross P. Vigneault N. Provencher S. Potier M. Roberts K.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 98: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The properties of the HSP-associated galactosyltransferase include the following: (i) sensitivity to α-lactalbumin (20Ross P. Vigneault N. Provencher S. Potier M. Roberts K.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 98: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), a modifier protein in mammalian milk (21Brodbeck U. Ebner K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 762-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that shifts the substrate acceptor specificity of breast milk galactosyltransferase from GlcNAc to Glc (22Brew K. Vanaman T.C. Hill R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar); (ii) origin primarily in the prostate and epididymis (19Tadolini B. Wilson T.J. Reddy P.R. Williams-Ashman H.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1976; 15: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Ross P. Vigneault N. Provencher S. Potier M. Roberts K.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 98: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); and (iii) androgen dependence (20Ross P. Vigneault N. Provencher S. Potier M. Roberts K.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 98: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A possible functional linkage is the observation that human sperm penetration through cervical mucus is positively correlated with this HSP-associated β-galactosyltransferase activity (23Ronquist G. Stegmayr B. Andren C. Wikstrom K. Urol. Int. 1985; 40: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar).Another interesting finding is that the level of HSP-associated α-fucosyltransferase activity greatly exceeds the β-galactosyltransferase activity in vitro (24Ronquist G. Urol. Int. 1987; 42: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with the content of fucosylated oligosaccharides present in HSP. This α-fucosyltransferase activity originates primarily in the prostate and is also androgen-dependent (25Ronquist G. Stegmayr B. Urol. Res. 1984; 12: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).There is currently no evidence suggesting that other mammalian species express free oligosaccharides in their seminal plasma. However, there are data supporting the existence of glycosyltransferases and associated biosynthetic proteins in rat seminal plasma. Both a substantial β-galactosyltransferase activity and an α-lactalbumin homologue are present in rat seminal plasma (26Hamilton D.W. Biol. Reprod. 1981; 25: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Rat seminal plasma also contains very substantial amounts of α-fucosyltransferase activity (27Tulsiani D.R. Orgebin-Crist M.C. Skudlarek M.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1998; 53 (suppl.): 85-97Google Scholar). These enzymes are postulated to function in the modification of sperm-surface glycoproteins (27Tulsiani D.R. Orgebin-Crist M.C. Skudlarek M.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1998; 53 (suppl.): 85-97Google Scholar), but based on the current evidence such enzymes could be involved in free oligosaccharide synthesis.The function of HSP oligosaccharides in the male and/or the female reproductive systems is unknown.

The major O-glycans associated with human midcycle cervical mucins are terminated with Lewisx and Lewisy sequences (30Yurewicz E.C. Matsuura F. Moghissi K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2314-2322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as are HSP oligosaccharides.

Biochem. 1978; 85: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); (iii) the majority of complex HSP oligosaccharides are fucosylated; (iv) a subset of HSP oligosaccharides express the reducing end sequence (GlcNAcβ1–3/4Glc) not reported in human milk oligosaccharides; (v) HSP oligosaccharides exclusively express type 2 (Galβ1–4GlcNAc) but not the type 1 sequences (Galβ1–3GlcNAc) that predominate in human milk oligosaccharides (9Kunz C. Rudloff S. Baier W. Klein N. Strobel S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 699-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar); and (vi) the structural diversity of human milk oligosaccharides greatly exceeds that of HSP oligosaccharides (16Stahl B. Thurl S. Zeng J. Karas M. Hillenkamp F. Steup M. Sawatzki G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The pathway for the synthesis of HSP and human milk oligosaccharides may share some common features, however. β-Galactosyltransferase and α-fucosyltransferase activities associated with free oligosaccharide synthesis are present in human milk (17Nagasawa T. Kiyosawa I. Tanahashi N. J. Dairy Sci. 1971; 54: 835-841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 18Grollman E.F. Kobata A. Ginsburg V. J. Clin. Invest. 1969; 48: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similar enzymatic activities are also present in HSP (19Tadolini B. Wilson T.J. Reddy P.R. Williams-Ashman H.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1976; 15: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Ross P. Vigneault N. Provencher S. Potier M. Roberts K.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 98: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The properties of the HSP-associated galactosyltransferase include the following: (i) sensitivity to α-lactalbumin (20Ross P. Vigneault N. Provencher S. Potier M. Roberts K.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 98: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), a modifier protein in mammalian milk (21Brodbeck U. Ebner K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 762-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that shifts the substrate acceptor specificity of breast milk galactosyltransferase from GlcNAc to Glc (22Brew K. Vanaman T.C. Hill R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar); (ii) origin primarily in the prostate and epididymis (19Tadolini B. Wilson T.J. Reddy P.R. Williams-Ashman H.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1976; 15: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Ross P. Vigneault N. Provencher S. Potier M. Roberts K.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 98: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); and (iii) androgen dependence (20Ross P. Vigneault N. Provencher S. Potier M. Roberts K.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 98: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A possible functional linkage is the observation that human sperm penetration through cervical mucus is positively correlated with this HSP-associated β-galactosyltransferase activity (23Ronquist G. Stegmayr B. Andren C. Wikstrom K. Urol. Int. 1985; 40: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Another interesting finding is that the level of HSP-associated α-fucosyltransferase activity greatly exceeds the β-galactosyltransferase activity in vitro (24Ronquist G. Urol. Int. 1987; 42: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with the content of fucosylated oligosaccharides present in HSP. This α-fucosyltransferase activity originates primarily in the prostate and is also androgen-dependent (25Ronquist G. Stegmayr B. Urol. Res. 1984; 12: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). There is currently no evidence suggesting that other mammalian species express free oligosaccharides in their seminal plasma. However, there are data supporting the existence of glycosyltransferases and associated biosynthetic proteins in rat seminal plasma. Both a substantial β-galactosyltransferase activity and an α-lactalbumin homologue are present in rat seminal plasma (26Hamilton D.W. Biol. Reprod. 1981; 25: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Rat seminal plasma also contains very substantial amounts of α-fucosyltransferase activity (27Tulsiani D.R. Orgebin-Crist M.C. Skudlarek M.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1998; 53 (suppl.): 85-97Google Scholar). These enzymes are postulated to function in the modification of sperm-surface glycoproteins (27Tulsiani D.R. Orgebin-Crist M.C. Skudlarek M.D. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1998; 53 (suppl.): 85-97Google Scholar), but based on the current evidence such enzymes could be involved in free oligosaccharide synthesis. The function of HSP oligosaccharides in the male and/or the female reproductive systems is unknown. Because humans do not inject semen directly into the uterus, sperm and other seminal plasma components must traverse the cervical mucin plug to enter this organ (reviewed in Ref. 28Gipson I.K. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D1245-D1255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It may be easier for smaller components like free oligosaccharides to move through this plug at midcycle to influence events within the uterus and the oviduct. Support of sperm function in the uterus and oviduct would certainly be physiologically relevant. Of the several million sperm present in human semen, at most a few hundred arrive in the ampulla of the oviduct where fertilization takes place (reviewed in Ref. 1Setchell B.P. Brooks D.E. Knobil E. Neill J.D. Perspectives in Male Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1980: 753-856Google Scholar). Indeed, a very great mystery is how natural fertilization occurs in the presence of such low concentrations of sperm compared with those required for successful in vitro fertilization or sperm binding assays. The logical reason is that male and female factors operating within the vagina and oviduct facilitate this process. Possible supportive effects of free oligosaccharides on sperm function include the following: (i) increasing sperm longevity by delaying hyperactivation; (ii) modifying sperm motion parameters that increase fertility, especially progressive motility; and (iii) promoting sperm binding to eggs. Human sperm display decreased hyperactivation and increased progressive motility following exposure to human cervical mucinsin vitro (29Eriksen G.V. Carlstedt I. Uldbjerg N. Ernst E. Fertil. Steril. 1998; 70: 350-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The major O-glycans associated with human midcycle cervical mucins are terminated with Lewisx and Lewisy sequences (30Yurewicz E.C. Matsuura F. Moghissi K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2314-2322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as are HSP oligosaccharides. Human sperm binding to the zona pellucida is increased by 20% in the hemizona assay in the presence of fucose (1 mg/ml) but not other monosaccharides (31Oehninger S. Acosta A. Hodgen G.D. Fertil. Steril. 1990; 53: 143-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, glycodelin-S, a HSP glycoprotein also terminated with Lewisx and Lewisy sequences, increases sperm binding in the hemizona assay by 50% at physiological concentrations (6Morris H.R. Dell A. Easton R.L. Panico M. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Oehninger S. Patankar M.S. Seppala M. Clark G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32159-32167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The expression of fucosylated sequences on free oligosaccharides, mucins, and glycoproteins may promote sperm-egg binding in the human oviduct. The oligosaccharides associated with HSP could also play a pivotal role in blocking immune/inflammatory cell reactions in the male and female reproductive systems. Except for sperm, leukocytes are the most prevalent cell type present in HSP from fertile males. These leukocytes are primarily neutrophils, with lower numbers of monocytes and T cells (reviewed in Ref. 32Wolff H. Fertil. Steril. 1995; 63: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Leukocytospermia is a condition characterized by excessive numbers of leukocytes in semen (reviewed in Ref. 33Aitken R.J. Baker H.W. Hum. Reprod. 1995; 10: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Elevation in leukocytes above a certain threshold is associated with male infertility (32Wolff H. Fertil. Steril. 1995; 63: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also a very profound influx of leukocytes into the vagina and cervix following intercourse, an event referred to as the leukocyte reaction (34Thompson L.A. Barratt C.L. Bolton A.E. Cooke I.D. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1992; 28: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The majority of the invasive cells are neutrophils, with minor amounts of natural killer cells and monocytes (34Thompson L.A. Barratt C.L. Bolton A.E. Cooke I.D. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1992; 28: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Human sperm express carbohydrate sequences that are recognized by natural killer cells (35Patankar M.S. Ozgur K. Oehninger S. Dell A. Morris H. Seppala M. Clark G.F. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 3: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), so they are likely protected from this type of lymphocyte. However, the factors protecting sperm from other immune and inflammatory cell types in semen and the uterus are not very well defined. There is some good evidence that prostate vesicles (prostasomes) present in HSP scavenge reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils and monocytes (36Saez F. Motta C. Boucher D. Grizard G. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 4: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, prostasomes may protect sperm from the toxic by-products of neutrophil metabolism. Other investigators suggest that prostaglandins (PGE2 and 19-hydroxy-PGE) present in HSP play a crucial role in the suppression of leukocytes (3Kelly R.W. Critchley H.O. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 12: 2200-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, incubation of the neutrophil model cell line U937 with a seminal plasma fraction enriched in PGE2 and 19-hydroxy-PGE had no effect on the release of the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 at the highest concentration tested (0.1% of the seminal plasma concentration) (37Denison F.C. Grant V.E. Calder A.A. Kelly R.W. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1999; 5: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). By contrast, incubation of U937 cells with media containing HSP diluted to the same extent induces substantial interleukin-10 release from U937 cells (37Denison F.C. Grant V.E. Calder A.A. Kelly R.W. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1999; 5: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This result implies that other components within HSP are likely responsible for the major suppressive effect of this secretion. One factor implicated in this immunomodulation is glycodelin-S, a glycoprotein that shares terminal Lewisx and Lewisy sequences with the HSP oligosaccharides (6Morris H.R. Dell A. Easton R.L. Panico M. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Oehninger S. Patankar M.S. Seppala M. Clark G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32159-32167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Human milk oligosaccharides block the binding of many pathogens or their toxins to colonic epithelial cells in vitro (reviewed in Refs. 9Kunz C. Rudloff S. Baier W. Klein N. Strobel S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 699-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar and 10Newburg D.S. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 117-127PubMed Google Scholar). Several of these crucial interactions are inhibited by fucosylated oligosaccharides present in this secretion. HSP oligosaccharides could also block infection with pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections. Fucosylated glycans have been implicated in infection with human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type I, and human immunodeficiency virus (38Zacharopoulos V.R. Phillips D.M. Microb. Pathog. 1997; 23: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39Ushijima H. Schroder H.C. Poznanovic S. Matthes E. Muller W.E. Res. Virol. 1992; 143: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Additional study will be required to determine whether HSP oligosaccharides confer any protective effect against pathogens in the male and/or female reproductive systems. In summary, free oligosaccharides of highly restricted sequence heterogeneity are expressed in the HSP of fertile men. The presence of a predominant modification of the complex glycans (fucosylation) suggests potential functional significance especially when linked to previous data collected in the human model. Further investigation will be required to define the precise physiological roles of these free oligosaccharides in human reproduction."

The majority of these receptors is composed of two α, two β, and one γ subunits. To identify sequences important for subunit assembly, we generated C-terminally truncated and chimeric γ3 constructs. From their ability to associate with full-length α1 and β3 subunits, we concluded that amino acid sequence γ3(70–84) either directly interacts with α1 or β3 subunits or stabilizes a contact site elsewhere in the protein. The observation that this sequence contains amino acid residues homologous to γ2 residues contributing to the benzodiazepine-binding site at the α1/γ2 interface suggested that in α1β3γ3 receptors the sequence γ3(70–84) is located at the α1/γ3 interface. In the absence of α1 subunits this sequence might allow assembly of β3 with γ3 subunits. Other experiments indicated that sequences γ3(86–95) and γ3(94–107), which are homologous to previously identified sequences important for assembly of γ2subunits, are also important for assembly of γ3 subunits. This indicates that during assembly of the GABAA receptor, more than one N-terminal sequence is important for binding to the same neighboring subunit. Whether the three sequences investigated are involved in direct interaction or stabilize other regions involved in intersubunit contacts has to be further studied. γ-Aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA) receptors are ligand-gated chloride channels and are the major inhibitory transmitter receptors in the central nervous system.

Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). These receptors carry binding sites for a number of pharmacologically and clinically important drugs, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, steroids, anesthetics, and convulsants, that modulate GABA-induced chloride ion flux by interacting with separate and distinct allosteric binding sites (2Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-234PubMed Google Scholar). The GABAA receptor is a hetero-oligomeric protein consisting of five subunits (3Nayeem N. Green T.P. Martin I.L. Barnard E.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 4Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So far at least 19 GABAA receptor subunits belonging to several subunit classes (six α, three β, three γ, one δ, one ε, one π, one θ, and three ρ subunits) have been identified in the mammalian nervous system (5Barnard E.A. Skolnick P. Olsen R.W. Möhler H. Sieghart W. Biggio G. Braestrup C. Bateson A.N. Langer S.Z. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 291-313PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M.

Comp. Neurol. 1995; 359: 159-194Crossref Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) and by structural and conformational requirements during assembly (13Klausberger T. Sarto I. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Furtmüller R.

The assembly of hetero-oligomeric receptors of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily comprising the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, GABAA receptor, glycine receptor, and 5-hydroxytryptamine, type 3 receptor, is a complex, multistep process that also requires conformational changes in the involved subunits (for review see Ref.19Green W.N. Millar N.S. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 280-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The assembly of subunits seems to occur in the endoplasmic reticulum and to involve interaction with chaperone molecules (20Gelman M.S. Chang W. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Prives J.M. J. Biol.

The processes that lead from single subunits to completely assembled and pharmacologically functional receptors are still a matter of debate. For the assembly of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, a sequential mechanism was proposed (22Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Green W.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Keller S.H. Taylor P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas for the GABAA receptors it is not clear whether oligomerization can start randomly from any possible subunit dimer or follows a strict order of assembly intermediates (25Klausberger T. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Fuchs T. Ebert V. Sarto I. Sieghart W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16024-16032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the whole receptor superfamily the major determinants for intersubunit contacts seem to be located within the N-terminal domains (26Verrall S. Hall Z.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27Kreienkamp H.J. Maeda R.K. Sine S.M. Taylor P.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For the GABAA receptor, specific amino acid sequences have been identified in this domain that seem to mediate heteromeric and homomeric assembly of β subunits (29Taylor P.M Thomas P. Gorrie G.H. Connolly C.N. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6360-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or assembly of α with β subunits (30Taylor P.M. Connolly C.N. Kittler J.T. Gorrie G.H. Hosie A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the γ2 amino acid sequences γ2(91–104) and γ2(83–90) were identified as sites important for assembly with α1and β3 subunits, respectively (31Klausberger T. Fuchs K. Mayer B. Ehya N. Sieghart W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8921-8928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the γ3 subunit is 64% identical with that of the γ2 subunit (32Baer K. Essrich C. Benson J.A. Benke D. Bluethmann H. Fritschy J.-M. Lüscher B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12860-12865Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 33Herb A. Wisden W. Lüddens H. Puia G. Vicini S. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1433-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and each of these subunits contributes to the formation of the benzodiazepine-binding site that is located at the interface between the α and γ subunit (34Sigel E. Buhr A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In the present study it was investigated whether amino acid sequences homologous to putative assembly sites on γ2 subunits are also important for assembly of γ3 subunits. By using truncated as well as chimeric constructs, a novel amino acid sequence was identified on the γ3 subunit that either directly interacts with α1 or β3 subunits or stabilizes a contact site in a different region of the protein. In addition, it was demonstrated that sequences homologous to those previously identified on γ2 subunits are also important in γ3 subunits for interaction with neighboring subunits. It was thus concluded that during assembly of GABAAreceptors more than one N-terminal γ3 sequence is important for forming contacts with the same adjacent subunit. The antibodies anti-peptide α1(1–9), anti-peptide β3(1–13), anti-peptide α1(328–382), anti-peptide β3(345–408), and anti-peptide γ3(1–35) were generated and affinity-purified as described previously (4Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). None of these antibodies exhibited any cross-reactivity with any other GABAA receptor subunits as demonstrated in Western blot and immunoprecipitation studies using recombinant GABAAreceptors (9Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the generation of recombinant receptors, α1, β3, and γ3 subunits of GABAA receptors from rat brain were cloned and subcloned into pCDM8 (Invitrogen) and subsequently into pCI (Promega, Madison, WI) expression vectors as described previously (4Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Truncated subunits were constructed by PCR amplification using the full-length subunit as a template. The PCR primers containedEcoRI and XhoI restriction sites, which were used to clone the fragments into pCI vectors. The truncated subunits were confirmed by sequencing. Chimeras were constructed using the “gene splicing by overlap extension” technique (35****Google Scholar) and were cloned into pCI vectors using the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of the primers. Transformed HEK 293 cells (CRL 1573; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured as described (4Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3 × 106 cells were transfected with 20 μg of subunit cDNA for single subunit transfection using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (36Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On co-transfection with two or three different subunits, for each subunit 10 or 7 μg of cDNA/subunit was used, respectively. A total of about 20 μg of cDNA/transfection and a cDNA ratio of 1:1:1 seemed to be optimal for the expression of GABAA receptors under the conditions used as judged by receptor binding studies in cells transfected with α1, β3, and γ3 subunits. The cells were then harvested 36 h after transfection. At this time point the number of [3H]Ro 15-1788-binding sites formed per mg protein was at its maximum for cells transfected with α1, β3, and γ3 subunits. The results obtained, however, did not change when cells were harvested 34–48 h after transfection. In addition, judged by Western blot analysis, expression levels of full-length, truncated, or chimeric subunits were comparable at all harvesting times. The culture medium was removed from transfected HEK 293 cells, and cells from four culture dishes (diameter, 9.4 cm) were extracted with 800 μl of a Lubrol extraction buffer (1% Lubrol PX, 0.18% phosphatidylcholine, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 100 μg/ml bacitracin) for 8 h at 4 °C. The extract was centrifuged for 40 min at 150,000 × g at 4 °C. For Western blot analysis, the clear supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C under gentle shaking with 15 μg of antibodies directed against the full-length subunit. After the addition of Immunoprecipitin (Invitrogen; for preparation see Ref. 4Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 0.5% nonfat dry milk powder and shaking for additional 3 h at 4 °C, the precipitate was washed three times with a low salt immunoprecipitation buffer (IP low buffer) (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The precipitated proteins were dissolved in sample buffer (108 mm Tris-sulfate, pH 8.2, 10 mm EDTA, 25% (w/v) glycerol, 2% SDS, and 3% dithiothreitol). SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with digoxygenized antibodies were performed as described (4Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the truncated or chimeric constructs used in this study could be expressed to a comparable extent upon single transfection into HEK cells. Upon co-transfection of different constructs, however, the stability of fragments that could not bind stably to each other was reduced. This might have been due to proteolytic degradation caused by an unstable or unproductive interaction of the fragments. In all control experiments the extent of expression of fragments was therefore determined in singly transfected HEK cells (13Klausberger T. Sarto I. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Furtmüller R. Mayer B. Huck S. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9124-9133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For [3H]muscimol binding studies, the extracts of transfected HEK cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C under gentle shaking with either 2.5, 10, or 20 μg of γ3(1–35) antibodies or in a separate control experiment with a mixture of 5 μg of α1(1–9), 10 μg of β3(1–13), and 10 μg of γ3(1–35) antibodies/culture dish. After the addition of Immunoprecipitin and 0.5% nonfat dry milk powder and shaking for additional 3 h at 4 °C, the precipitate was washed three times with IP low buffer. The precipitated proteins were resuspended in 50 mm Tris/citrate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at a protein concentration in the range of 0.1–1 mg/ml as measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Aliquots of the suspension were then incubated for 60 min at 4 °C in a total of 1 ml of a solution containing 50 mm Tris/citrate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20 nm of [3H]muscimol (28.1 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the absence or presence of 1 mm GABA. The precipitates were then filtered through Whatman GF/B filters, and the filters were washed twice with 3.5 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris/citrate buffer and were then subjected to scintillation counting. Unspecific binding in the presence of 1 mm GABA was subtracted from total [3H]muscimol binding to result in specific binding (37Zezula J. Slany A. Sieghart W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 301: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The culture medium was removed from HEK 293 cells transfected with cDNA (21 μg/3 × 106 cells) of GABAA receptor subunits (cDNA ratio 1:1:1), and the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, and 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.3). The cells were then detached from the culture dishes by incubating with 2.5 ml of 5 mmEDTA in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature. The resulting cell suspension was diluted in 6.5 ml of cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g. For Western blot analysis, the pellet from two dishes was incubated with 30 μg of α1(1–9) or γ3(1–35) antibodies in 3 ml of the same medium for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were again pelleted, and free antibodies were removed by washing twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer. Then receptors were extracted with IP low buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h under gentle shaking. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (30 min; 150,000 × g; 4 °C). After the addition of Immunoprecipitin and 0.5% nonfat dry milk powder to the clear supernatant and shaking for 3 h at 4 °C, the precipitate was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g and washed three times with IP low buffer. The precipitated proteins were dissolved in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using digoxygenized antibodies. Secondary antibodies (anti-digoxygenin-AP, Fab fragments; Roche Diagnostics) were visualized by the reaction of alkaline phosphatase with CSPD (Tropix, Bedford, MA). The protein bands were quantified by densitometry of Kodak X-Omat S films with the Docu Gel 2000i gel documentation system using RFLPscan software (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). The linear range of the detection system was established by determining the antibody response to a range of antigen concentrations following immunoblotting. The experimental conditions were designed such that immunoreactivities obtained in the assay were within this linear range, thus permitting a direct comparison of the amount of antigen applied per gel lane between samples. Different exposures of the same membrane were used to ensure that the measured signal was in the linear range of the x-ray film. For radioligand binding studies, the pellet from six dishes was incubated with a mixture of 20 μg of α1(1–9), 60 μg of β3(1–13), and 60 μg of γ3(1–35) antibodies or with 60 μg of γ3(1–35) antibodies in 6 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 45 min at 37 °C. The cells were again pelleted, and free antibodies were removed by washing twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer. Then receptors were extracted with IP low buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h under gentle shaking. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (30 min; 150,000 × g; 4 °C). After the addition of Immunoprecipitin and 0.5% nonfat dry milk powder and shaking for 3 h at 4 °C, the precipitate was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g and washed three times with IP low buffer. The precipitated proteins were resuspended in 50 mmTris/citrate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, at a protein concentration in the range of 0.1–1 mg/ml and subjected to [3H]muscimol binding assay as described above. To verify that only receptors on the cell surface were labeled by the antibodies, parallel samples were incubated with antibodies directed against the intracellular loop of GABAA receptor subunits (experiments not shown). These antibodies could not precipitate any GABAA receptor subunits under the conditions used. A possible redistribution of the antibodies during the extraction procedure could be excluded by an experiment performed analogous to that described (31Klausberger T. Fuchs K. Mayer B. Ehya N. Sieghart W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8921-8928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The EMBL PredictProtein server (38Sander C. Schneider R. Proteins. 1991; 9: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar) was used to align γ3 sequences to homologous sequences available in the SwissProt data base and then to predict the secondary structure based on the set of aligned sequences by the PHDsec method (39Rost B. Sander C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7558-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 40Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). The significance of this neural network, based secondary structure prediction for the sequences of interest, was evaluated by force field calculations within a Dynamic Monte Carlo optimization scheme (41Kirkpatrick S. Gelatt C. Vecchi M. Science. 1983; 220: 498-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31376) Google Scholar). In this procedure the structure optimization started with the sequence in extended conformation (φ, ψ = 180°). Within one Dynamic Monte Carlo step a single φ, ψ, or side chain dihedral angle was updated in the range −180 to 180, the conformational energy was calculated within the ECEPP/3 force field (42Nemethy G. Gibson K.D. Palmer K.A. Yoon C.N. Paterlini G. Zagari A. J. Phys. Chem. 1992; 96: 6472-6484Crossref Scopus (633) Google Scholar), and the free energy of solvation was computed based on a continuum solvation model. 2 × 105 Dynamic Monte Carlo steps were performed. The final acceptance probability was given by a modified Metropolis criterium considering both conformational and solvation energies. The details on the optimization algorithm are given in Ref. 43Mayer B. Marconi G. J. Comput. Chem. 2000; 21: 170-181Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar. Recently, it has been demonstrated that γ2(1–113) was the shortest γ2 fragment that still could assemble with full-length α1 and β3 subunits (31Klausberger T. Fuchs K. Mayer B. Ehya N. Sieghart W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8921-8928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the present study it was investigated whether the same holds true for fragment γ3(1–116), which is homologous to γ2(1–113) (Fig.1A). For this, fragment γ3(1–116) was either singly transfected into HEK cells or co-transfected with full-length α1 or β3subunits. Expressed subunits were extracted from these cells and immunoprecipitated either with γ3(1–35) or with α1(328–382) or β3(345–408) antibodies, respectively. The precipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using digoxygenized γ3(1–35) antibodies. Fragment γ3(1–116) contained a single glycosylation site and migrated as two protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 14 and 16 kDa that presumably represented the unglycosylated and glycosylated fragments, respectively (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1 (C and D), fragment γ3(1–116) could be co-precipitated with α1or β3 subunits from appropriately transfected HEK cells. These data indicated that binding sites for α1 and β3 subunits are located on homologous N-terminal fragments of γ2 and γ3 subunits. To identify amino acid sequences important for binding, the even shorter N-terminal γ3 fragments γ3(1–84) and γ3(1–72) were generated, and their interaction with full-length α1 and β3 subunits was investigated after co-transfection into HEK cells. Fragments γ3(1–84) and γ3(1–72) exhibit molecular masses of 9.4 and 8.2 kDa, respectively, and migrated as single protein bands (Fig. 1B), consistent with the observation that these fragments do not contain a putative glycosylation site (33Herb A. Wisden W. Lüddens H. Puia G. Vicini S. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1433-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Whereas γ3(1–84) still could be co-precipitated with α1 and β3 subunits (Fig. 1, Cand D), no co-precipitation with these subunits could be detected for the shorter fragment γ3(1–72). Although expression of fragment γ3(1–72) was reduced compared with that of γ3(1–84) (Fig. 1B), a stable binding of this fragment to α1 or β3subunits would have been detected. The inability of α1(328–382) or β3(345–408) antibodies to co-precipitate the fragment γ3(1–72) or to precipitate the fragment γ3(1–116) after single transfection into HEK cells (experiments not shown) confirmed the conclusion that these antibodies did not cross-react with the γ3 fragments used. The observation that γ3(1–84) still could be co-precipitated with α1 and β3 subunits was surprising, because this fragment no longer contained the sequences γ3(86–93) and γ3(94–107) that are homologous to the sequences γ2(83–90) and γ2(91–104) that previously have been identified to be important for binding of γ2 to β3 and α1 subunits, respectively (Fig. 1A). This indicated that γ3 subunits possibly use sequences different from those of γ2 subunits for assembly with α1 and β3 subunits and that these γ3 sequences are located within the N-terminal 84 amino acids of the mature γ3 peptide. To identify amino acid sequences important for binding to α1and/or β3 subunits, it was investigated which γ3 sequences could induce binding to these subunits after incorporation into a fragment that originally could not bind to α1 or β3 subunits. The fragment α1(1–68) seemed to be suitable for this purpose because it is homologous to γ3(1–84) but could not be co-precipitated with α1 or β3 subunits after co-expression in HEK cells (Fig.2A). Several chimeras were constructed in which the C-terminal part of the α1(1–68) fragment was replaced by the corresponding γ3 sequence (Fig. 2A). These chimeras were transfected into HEK cells together with full-length α1or β3 subunits, and expressed fragments were co-precipitated using α1(328–382) or β3(345–408) antibodies, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). These antibodies were directed against the amino acid sequences of the intracellular loop of α1or β3 subunits, respectively, and only recognized full-length subunits but not the truncated chimeras. The precipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were detected using digoxygenized α1(1–9) antibodies in Western blots. The actual expression of the chimeras was confirmed by precipitation with α1(1–9) antibodies and detection with digoxygenized α1(1–9) antibodies (Fig. 2D). Chim1, in which the sequence α1(35–68) of the α1(1–68) fragment was replaced by the homologous sequence γ3(51–84), could be co-precipitated with α1 as well as with β3 subunits (Fig. 2, A–C). Chim2, however, in which the sequence α1(35–53) was replaced by the homologous sequence γ3(51–69), could not be co-precipitated with full-length α1 or β3 subunits. This indicated that the sequence important for binding to α1 and β3subunits is located within the amino acid sequence γ3(70–84). This conclusion was confirmed by the observation that Chim3, in which the sequence α1(54–68) of the α1(1–68) fragment was replaced by the homologous sequence γ3(70–84), was able to bind to α1and β3 subunits (Fig. 2, A–C). To investigate which part of the γ3(70–84) sequence is important for assembly with α1 or β3 subunits, four additional chimeras of the α1(1–68) fragment were constructed (Fig.3A). In Chim4, α1(61–68) was replaced by amino acids γ3(77–84), in Chim5 α1(57–68) was replaced by γ3(73–84), in Chim6 α1(54–59) was replaced by γ3(70–75), and in Chim7 α1(54–62) was replaced by γ3(70–78). All of these chimeras were expressed to a similar extent after transfection into HEK cells (experiments not shown). None of these chimeras could be co-precipitated with full-length β3 subunits, indicating that the complete γ3(70–84) sequence is needed for binding to this subunit (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, Chim6 could be co-precipitated with full-length α1 subunits, but the extent of co-precipitation was only 6 ± 2% (mean ± S.E., n = 3) of that of Chim3 as quantified by densitometry of protein bands (see “Experimental Procedures”). Binding of Chim7 to α1 subunits was stronger than that of Chim6, but the extent of co-precipitation of Chim7 with α1 subunits was still only 19 ± 5% (mean ± S.E., n = 3) of that of Chim3. Thus, the complete γ3(70–84) sequence was necessary to allow b"
https://openalex.org/W2006246493,"Abstract The 24-kDa form of basic fibroblast growth factor inhibits the migration of endothelial cells and mammary carcinoma cells while continuing to promote cell proliferation. This molecule consists of the 18-kDa fibroblast growth factor sequence plus an additional 55 amino acids at the amino-terminal end. Antibody neutralization studies suggested that the inhibition of migration is associated with these 55 amino acids, whereas the promotion of proliferation localizes to the 18-kDa domain. To determine whether 24kD basic fibroblast growth factor could be modified to eliminate its effect on cell proliferation but retain its inhibition of migration, portions of the carboxyl-terminal end of 24kD fibroblast growth factor were deleted, and the products were tested on MCF-7 and endothelial cells. A protein consisting of the 55 amino acids of the amino-terminal end and the first 31 amino acids of 18kD basic fibroblast growth factor (ATE+31) inhibited migration by 80% but did not promote cell growth. Arginine to alanine substitutions within the first 21 amino acids of the carboxyl-terminal end substantially reduced the efficacy of ATE+31, whereas substitutions in the remaining part of the molecule had no effect. Competition binding experiments showed that ATE+31 does not compete with 24kD basic fibroblast growth factor for binding to fibroblast growth factor receptor 1. In an in vivo matrigel plug assay, 150 nm ATE+31 peptide reduced angiogenesis by 80%. These studies demonstrate that the amino-terminal end of 24kD basic fibroblast growth factor is responsible for an activity that inhibits the migration rates of cultured cells as well as the angiogenic response in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2050427350,"Chondroitinase B from <i>Flavobacterium heparinum</i> is the only known lyase that cleaves the glycosaminoglycan, dermatan sulfate (DS), as its sole substrate. A recent co-crystal structure of chondroitinase B with a disaccharide product of DS depolymerization has provided some insight into the location of the active site and suggested potential roles of some active site residues in substrate binding and catalysis. However, this co-crystal structure was not representative of the actual enzyme-substrate complex, because the disaccharide product did not have the right length or the chemical structure of the minimal substrate (tetrasaccharide) involved in catalysis. Therefore, only a limited picture of the functional role of active site residues in DS depolymerization was presented in previous structural studies. In this study, by docking a DS tetrasaccharide into the proposed active site of the enzyme, we have identified novel roles of specific active site amino acids in the catalytic function of chondroitinase B. Our conformational analysis also revealed a unique, symmetrical arrangement of active site amino acids that may impinge on the catalytic mechanism of action of chondroitinase B. The catalytic residues Lys-250, Arg-271, His-272, and Glu-333 along with the substrate binding residues Arg-363 and Arg-364 were mutated using site-directed mutagenesis, and the kinetics and product profile of each mutant were compared with recombinant chondroitinase B. Mutating Lys-250 to alanine resulted in inactivation of the enzyme, potentially attributable to the role of the residue in stabilizing the carbanion intermediate formed during enzymatic catalysis. The His-272 and Glu-333 mutants showed diminished enzymatic activity that could be indicative of a possible role for one or both residues in the abstraction of the C-5 proton from the galactosamine. In addition, the Arg-364 mutant had an altered product profile after exhaustive digestion of DS, suggesting a role for this residue in defining the substrate specificity of chondroitinase B."
