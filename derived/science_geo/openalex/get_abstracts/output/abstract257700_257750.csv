Enforced expression of XBP-1(S), a transcriptional activator generated by unfolded protein response-mediated splicing of Xbp-1 mRNA, is sufficient to induce proliferation of rough ER. We previously showed that XBP-1(S)-induced ER biogenesis in fibroblasts correlates with increased production of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), the primary phospholipid of the ER membrane, and enhanced activities of the choline cytidylyltransferase (CCT) and cholinephosphotransferase enzymes in the cytidine diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) pathway of PtdCho biosynthesis. Here, we report that the level and synthesis of CCT, the rate-limiting enzyme in the CDP-choline pathway, is elevated in fibroblasts overexpressing XBP-1(S). Furthermore, overexpression experiments demonstrated that raising the activity of CCT, but not cholinephosphotransferase, is sufficient to augment PtdCho biosynthesis in fibroblasts, indicating that XBP-1(S) increases the output of the CDP-choline pathway primarily via its effects on CCT. Finally, fibroblasts overexpressing CCT up-regulated PtdCho synthesis to a level similar to that in XBP-1(S)-transduced cells but exhibited only a small increase in rough ER and no induction of secretory pathway genes. The more robust XBP-1(S)-induced ER expansion was accompanied by induction of a wide array of genes encoding proteins that function either in the ER or at other steps in the secretory pathway. We propose that XBP-1(S) regulates ER abundance by coordinately increasing the supply of membrane phospholipids and ER proteins, the key ingredients for ER biogenesis.

Braakman I. Craig E. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 191-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). As such, the ER can adapt to accommodate an increased load of nascent polypeptides. For example, when B-lymphocytes differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells, an elaborate network of rough ER develops to facilitate immunoglobulin production (2Shohat M. Janossy G. Dourmashkin R.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1973; 3: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Wiest D.L. Burkhardt J.K. Hester S. Hortsch M. Meyer D.I. Argon Y. J.

Biophys. 1991; 284: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Likewise, the rough ER is highly developed in other specialized secretory cell types such as pancreatic acinar cells that secrete copious amounts of digestive enzymes (5Bolender R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ER is sparse in non-secretory cells, such as reticulocytes (6Grasso J.A. Sullivan A.L. Chan S.C. J. Cell Sci. 1978; 31: 165-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ER abundance, therefore, is regulated according to the demands on the secretory pathway. However, the mechanisms that regulate ER biogenesis are incompletely defined (7Federovitch C.M. Ron D. Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).A key regulator of ER homeostasis is the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, a complex signaling system emanating from the ER membrane (8Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). When the protein folding capacity of the ER is challenged, the UPR relieves the resulting stress by repressing translation, increasing expression of ER chaperones and folding enzymes, and enhancing ER-associated degradation (8Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have uncovered a connection between the UPR and ER abundance (9Shaffer A.L. Shapiro-Shelef M. Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H. Quian S.B. Zhao H. Yu X. Yang L. Tan B.K. Rosenwald A.

Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The UPR-regulated transcription factor X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1) is required for proper development and function of plasma cells (11Reimold A.M. Iwakoshi N.N. Manis J. Vallabhajosyula P. Szomolanyi-Tsuda E. Gravallese E.M. Friend D. Grusby M.J. Alt F. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 2001; 412: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 12Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H. Vallabhajosyula P. Otipoby K.L. Rajewsky K. Glimcher L.H. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), pancreatic acinar cells, and salivary gland cells (13Lee A.H. Chu G.C. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4368-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), all of which normally contain large quantities of rough ER necessary for high level synthesis of their respective secretory cargoes. In the absence of Xbp-1 expression, these cell types exhibit poorly developed ER, reduced expression of many ER proteins, and severely compromised secretory activity (11Reimold A.M. Iwakoshi N.N. Manis J. Vallabhajosyula P. Szomolanyi-Tsuda E. Gravallese E.M. Friend D. Grusby M.J. Alt F. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 2001; 412: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 13Lee A.H. Chu G.C. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4368-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Xbp-1 mRNA is modified by a novel splicing mechanism initiated by IRE1 (first identified in yeast, inositol requiring mutant), an ER transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease that serves as a proximal transducer of the UPR (14Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 15Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). IRE1 executes site-specific cleavage of Xbp-1 mRNA and the resulting fragments are ligated to yield a transcript encoding a basic leucine zipper protein, termed XBP-1(S), that bears a strong transactivating domain (16Calfon M.

Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2903) Google Scholar). Enforced expression of XBP-1(S) is sufficient to drive expansion of the rough ER (10Sriburi R. Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), increase expression of a large number of ER proteins (9Shaffer A.L. Shapiro-Shelef M. Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H. Quian S.B. Zhao H. Yu X. Yang L. Tan B.K. Rosenwald A. Hurt E.M. Petroulakis E. Sonenberg N. Yewdell J.W. Calame K. Glimcher L.H. Staudt L.M.

Therefore, XBP-1(S) is necessary and sufficient for the biogenesis of functional ER, yet the mechanisms by which this transcription factor mediates these effects have not been fully delineated.Synthesis of phophatidylcholine (PtdCho), the most abundant cellular phospholipid and a major component of ER membranes, is up-regulated in fibroblasts overexpressing XBP-1(S) (10Sriburi R. Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). PtdCho is primarily produced by the cytidine diphosphocholine (CDP-choline), also known as the Kennedy pathway (20Lykidis A. Jackowski S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 361-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the rate-limiting step of the pathway, choline cytidylyltransferase (CCT) converts phosphocholine to CDP-choline in the presence of CTP (21Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The phosphocholine moiety of CDP-choline is then transferred to diacylglycerol (DAG), yielding PtdCho (20Lykidis A. Jackowski S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 361-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This final step is catalyzed by either cholinephosphotransferase (CPT1) (22Henneberry A.L. Wistow G. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29808-29815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase (CEPT1), a bifunctional enzyme that can synthesize both PtdCho and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) (23Henneberry A.L. McMaster C.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We previously showed that fibroblasts overexpressing XBP-1(S) exhibit enhanced activities of CCT and CPT1/CEPT1 (10Sriburi R. Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), but the relative role of these alterations in XBP-1(S)-induced Ptd-Cho biosynthesis and ER expansion has not been clarified. Neither is it clear whether an increased supply of PtdCho is sufficient for ER biogenesis.Here, we report that the level and synthesis of CCT is up-regulated in fibroblasts overexpressing XBP-1(S). Furthermore, our data indicate that enhanced CCT activity in the CDP-choline pathway is the primary means by which XBP-1(S) up-regulates PtdCho production. We also demonstrate that increased synthesis of PtdCho alone in CCT-transduced cells is sufficient for only a meager expansion of rough ER. In contrast, XBP-1(S)-transduced fibroblasts exhibit increased PtdCho synthesis, elevated expression of many ER proteins, and robust ER expansion. Thus, we propose that XBP-1(S) orchestrates ER biogenesis by coordinately regulating phospholipid biosynthesis and expression of ER proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—pBMN-I-GFP (Dr. G. Nolan, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA) encodes a bicistronic mRNA with a GFP cassette 3′ of the internal ribosomal entry site (I). pBMN-hXBP-1(S)-I-GFP encodes full-length human XBP-1 generated by UPR-mediated splicing (10Sriburi R. Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). pBMN-mCEPT1-I-GFP encodes full-length mouse CEPT1 (nucleotides 1–2050; GenBank™ accession number BC023783) and was generated by subcloning a NotI-StuI insert from pCMV-Sport6-mCEPT1 (American Type Culture Collection #7062235) into pBMN-I-GFP. pBMN-hCPT1-I-GFP encodes full-length human CPT1 (nucleotides 1–1579; GenBank accession #BC050429) and was generated by subcloning a NotI-StuI insert from pCMV-Sport6-hCPT1 (American Type Culture Collection #9271995) into pBMN-I-GFP. pBMN-mCCTα-I-GFP encodes full-length mouse CCTα (nucleotides 47–1150) and was generated by subcloning a XhoI-HindIII insert from pPJ37-CT into pBMN-I-GFP.Cell Culture and Retroviral Transduction—NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and Phoenix-Eco cells (Dr. G. Nolan) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (24Gass J.N. Gifford N.M. Brewer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49047-49054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Ecotropic retroviruses, produced using pBMN plasmids and Phoenix-Eco packaging cells (25Gunn K.E. Gifford N.M. Mori K. Brewer J.W. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), were used for retroviral transduction of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (26Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) with ≥95% efficiency, as measured by GFP fluorescence using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) (10Sriburi R. Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar).Immunoblotting—Cell lysates of pelleted cells were prepared using a 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (24Gass J.N. Gifford N.M. Brewer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49047-49054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Microsomes were prepared from pelleted cells as described (23Henneberry A.L. McMaster C.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Total protein concentrations of clarified Nonidet P-40 lysates and microsomal preparations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by chemiluminescent immunoblotting as previously described (24Gass J.N. Gifford N.M. Brewer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49047-49054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-CCTα antibody (27Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was raised against full-length recombinant rodent CCTα (28Luche M.M. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-XBP-1 antibody was raised with the assistance of Rockland Immunochemicals against the N-terminal 81 amino acids of XBP-1 fused in-frame to glutathione S-transferase. Polyclonal rabbit antisera against BiP/GRP78, GRP94, ERdj3, and calnexin were generously provided by Dr. Linda Hendershot (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). Rabbit anti-TRAPα was a gift from Dr. Chris Nicchitta (Duke University, Durham, NC). The rabbit anti-protein disulfide isomerase polyclonal antibody (Stressgen Bioreagents), mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody, clone AC-15 (Sigma), peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, and peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were purchased.Metabolic Labeling and Analysis of CCTα Synthesis—Cells were washed twice with warm phosphate-buffered saline and then cultured in warm media lacking methionine and cysteine (Invitrogen) for 20 min. Cells were then labeled for various intervals with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine using 100 μCi/ml of Tran35S-label (MB Biomedicals). Labeled cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then solubilized in the dish on ice in cold lysing buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Post-nuclear supernatants were prepared, normalized to cell number, and pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) pre-coated with normal rabbit sera. Pre-cleared lysates were then incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads pre-coated with rabbit anti-CCTα antibodies. In each case, the beads were then washed 4 times with cold washing buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 400 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), resuspended in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were processed, and signals were visualized and quantified using a Typhoon PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) as described (24Gass J.N. Gifford N.M. Brewer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49047-49054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To measure the incorporation of radiolabeled methionine and cysteine into proteins, lysates from metabolically labeled cells were normalized to cell number, and equivalent amounts were spotted on Whatman filter paper in triplicate. Filters were boiled in 10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by scintillation spectroscopy.Analysis of Phosphocholine, CDP-choline, PtdCho, and PtdEtn Synthesis—To assess production of phosphocholine, CDP-choline, and PtdCho, cells were cultured in choline chloride-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline chloride (81 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 37 °C. After labeling, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in methanol/water (2:0.8, v/v). Lipids were extracted (29Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar), radiolabeled PtdCho in the lipid fraction was assessed (10Sriburi R. Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), and the aqueous phase was saved for analysis. After drying by vacuum, choline, phosphocholine, and CDP-choline in the aqueous phase were separated by thin layer chromatography in a solvent system of methanol, 0.78% NaCl, ammonium hydroxide (50:50:5, v/v). The spots were identified by co-migration with authentic standards, scraped, and assessed for radioactivity by scintillation spectroscopy. In some experiments, PtdCho synthesis was measured as previously described (10Sriburi R. Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). To assess PtdEtn synthesis, cells were cultured for 2 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 μCi/ml [1-3H]ethanolamine hydrochloride (60 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemical). After labeling, radiolabel incorporated into chloroform-soluble metabolites was determined as in the analysis of PtdCho synthesis.Analysis of CCT and CPT Enzymatic Activity—Pelleted frozen cells (2 × 107 cells) were used for assays of CCT enzymatic activity as described previously (30Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 31Lykidis A. Wang J. Karim M.A. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2174-2179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). CPT activity was assessed as described previously (23Henneberry A.L. McMaster C.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) using microsomes prepared from pelleted frozen cells (2 × 107 cells).Electron Microscopy, Stereological Measurements of Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum, and Cell Size Determinations—Cells were processed and examined by electron microscopy as previously described (10Sriburi R. Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Two independent stereological sets containing electron micrographs of empty vector-, XBP-1(S)-, and CCTα-transduced cells at magnifications of 8,000 and 20,000 were analyzed for ER surface area and ER volume as described previously (10Sriburi R. Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Average cell size was determined from light microscopy analysis of thick sections using the Scion image program (Scion). The mean cell area (μm2) was determined in a minimum of 10 fields.Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and subjected to DNase I digestion to remove contaminating genomic DNA. Microarray analysis was performed for each sample using the Affymetrix GeneChip® mouse genome arrays MOE430A or MOE430V2 at the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. For empty vector- and XBP-1(S)-transduced cells, a total of four separate experiments was performed. For CCTα-transduced cells, two separate experiments were performed. In each experiment, the integrity of the total RNA was determined using the Agilent Bioanalyzer Lab-on-a-Chip, and the RNA sample was converted to cDNA, labeled, and fragmented using procedures recommended by Affymetrix. Fragmented labeled cDNA (4.0 μg) was hybridized for 16 h at 50 °C to the array. After washing, staining and scanning of the arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix). The arrays were analyzed using the GeneChip® Operating Software (GCOS), and global scaling was used to normalize the data from different arrays. Spotfire® DecisionSite® 8.2.1 and the NetAffx™ Analysis Center (32Liu G. Loraine A.E. Shigeta R. Cline M. Cheng J. Valmeekam V. Sun S. Kulp D. Siani-Rose M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) were used to analyze array results. Genechips were hybridized in duplicate (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital). The statistical analyses were performed on data sets from all of the experiments that were independently processed and hybridized. The statistical significance of XBP-1(S) or CCTα overexpression was determined using two-tailed unpaired t test with the confidence intervals set at 95% and data with p values ≤0.05 were significant.Phospholipid Analysis—Cells (2 × 107) were pelleted and supernatant was removed. Cells were flash-frozen and stored at –80 °C until analysis. Cell pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in 1 ml of water or phosphate-buffered saline. The total volume was measured, and a 100-μl aliquot was removed for protein determination (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted (3Wiest D.L. Burkhardt J.K. Hester S. Hortsch M. Meyer D.I. Argon Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1501-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) from a 900-μl aliquot using 2.4 ml of acetic acid in methanol (2%, v/v) and 1 ml of chloroform in the first step followed by 1.5 ml of chloroform and 1.2 ml of water in the second step to yield two phases, organic and aqueous. The organic phase was collected and dried. Lipids were resuspended in 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). A 1-μl aliquot was loaded onto a thin-layer silica gel rod and developed first in ether, dried, and then developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:25:8:2, v/v/v/v). Lipids were detected by flame ionization using an Iatroscan instrument (Iatron Laboratories), and peaks were integrated with PEAKSIMPLE software (SRI Instruments). Peaks were identified by comigration with authentic standards, and the amount of each lipid species was calculated using standard curves for each.RESULTSPhospholipid Biosynthesis in XBP-1(S)-transduced Fibroblasts—We previously demonstrated that enforced expression of the transcription factor XBP-1(S) is sufficient to up-regulate PtdCho biosynthesis in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (10Sriburi R. Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of the CDP-choline pathway for PtdCho biosynthesis in XBP-1(S)-transduced cells revealed basal activity for choline kinase (CK), enhanced activity for CCT, and markedly elevated activity for CPT (10Sriburi R.

To further investigate the status of the CDP-choline pathway in XBP-1(S)-transduced cells, we metabolically labeled cells with [3H]choline and monitored the output of each step in the pathway. Chromatographic analysis of soluble cellular material allowed for analysis of both phosphocholine and CDP-choline, the products of the CK- and CCT-catalyzed steps, respectively. The level of phosphocholine synthesis was similar in empty vector- and XBP-1(S)-transduced cells (Fig. 1A), in keeping with the similar CK activity present in both populations (10Sriburi R. Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In contrast, the level of CDP-choline synthesis was increased ∼2-fold in XBP-1(S)-transduced cells (Fig. 1B), and as expected, this was accompanied by elevated production of PtdCho (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that the enhanced CCT activity present in XBP-1(S)-transduced cells increases the supply of CDP-choline for CPT-catalyzed production of PtdCho.Similar to PtdCho, the level of PtdEtn, the second most abundant phospholipid in cellular membranes, elevates in XBP-1(S)-transduced fibroblasts (10Sriburi R. Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). To further explore this observation, we performed metabolic labeling studies with [3H]ethanolamine and found that the synthesis of PtdEtn was increased ∼2-fold in XBP-1(S)-transduced cells (Fig. 1D). Therefore, enforced expression of XBP-1(S) augments cellular capacity for de novo synthesis of PtdCho and PtdEtn, two key phospholipid components of the ER membrane.Effect of XBP-1(S) on the Level and Synthesis of CCTα in Fibroblasts—PtdCho is the most abundant phospholipid in cellular membranes; thus, we focused our studies on delineating the connection between XBP-1(S) and the regulation of PtdCho biosynthesis. Given that CCT catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the CDP-choline pathway, we investigated the mechanism by which its activity is augmented in XBP-1(S)-transduced cells. We reasoned that the elevation of CCT activity might involve an increase in the level of the CCT enzyme. In testing this hypothesis, we focused on the steady-state level of CCTα, the predominant CCT isoform expressed in NIH-3T3 cells (10Sriburi R. Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of Nonidet P-40 soluble material revealed a nearly 50% increase in CCTα in XBP-1(S)-transduced cells (Fig. 2). Thus, the enhanced CCT activity in XBP-1(S)-transduced fibroblasts correlates with an increased pool of CCTα enzyme.FIGURE 2Level of the CCTα enzyme in XBP-1(S)-transduced NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. NIH-3T3 cells were transduced with either empty vector or XBP-1(S) retroviral vectors. At 48 h post-transduction, cells were harvested, and 2-fold serial dilutions of cell lysate protein were resolved by standard SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Cell lysates from NIH-3T3 cells transfected with pPJ37-CT, a plasmid encoding CCTα, was used as a positive control. Chemiluminescent immunoblotting was performed for CCTα and, as a loading control, β-actin. Densitometric analyses of films revealed the steady-state level of CCTα to be 1.48 ± 0.16 fold higher in XBP-1(S)-transduced cells as compared with empty vector controls (n = 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"
https://openalex.org/W1980291812,"The heat shock response is a defense reaction activated by proteotoxic damage induced by physiological or environmental stress. Cells respond to the proteotoxic damage by elevated expression of heat shock proteins (Hsps) that function as molecular chaperones and maintain the vital homeostasis of protein folds. Heat shock factors (HSFs) are the main transcriptional regulators of the stress-induced expression of hsp genes. Mammalian HSF1 was originally identified as the transcriptional regulator of the heat shock response, whereas HSF2 has not been implicated a role in the stress response. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that HSF1 and HSF2 interact through their trimerization domains, but the functional consequence of this interaction remained unclear. We have now demonstrated on chromatin that both HSF1 and HSF2 were able to bind the hsp70 promoter not only in response to heat shock but also during hemin-induced differentiation of K562 erythroleukemia cells. In both cases an intact HSF1 was required in order to reach maximal levels of promoter occupancy, suggesting that HSF1 influences the DNA binding activity of HSF2. The functional consequence of the HSF1-HSF2 interplay was demonstrated by real-time reverse transcription-PCR analyses, which showed that HSF2 was able to modulate the HSF1-mediated expression of major hsp genes. Our results reveal, contrary to the predominant model, that HSF2 indeed participates in the transcriptional regulation of the heat shock response.

Our results reveal, contrary to the predominant model, that HSF2 indeed participates in the transcriptional regulation of the heat shock response. The heat shock response enables the cell to cope with the deleterious effects of protein-damaging stresses, e.g. heat, heavy metals, and viral and bacterial infections. Characteristic of the heat shock response is a down-regulation of gene transcription and protein synthesis in general, whereas the transcription of a specific subset of genes called the heat shock genes is induced (1Lindquist S.

The classical heat shock genes include the hsp genes, but genome-wide analysis has revealed numerous other genes to be activated by heat and other stresses (3Murray J.I. Whitfield M.L. Trinklein N.D.

The induction of Hsps is mainly regulated by a family of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs), which bind to the heat shock elements (HSEs) on heat shock genes and other target genes (6Wu C. Annu.

Four HSFs (HSF1–4) exist in vertebrates. HSF1 and HSF2 are the most studied factors because of their co-expression in most tissues and cell lines (9Pirkkala L. Nykänen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar).

Mice lacking HSF1 and fibroblasts derived from these animals are sensitive to stress and do not develop thermotolerance or display induction of Hsps upon heat shock (20McMillan D.R. Xiao X. Shao L.

HSF2 has been regarded as functionally distinct from the stress-activated HSF1, because no stress-related role for HSF2 was identified in the initial studies, where this role was attributed to HSF1 (23Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 24Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

The early studies utilized antibody supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to identify the factor that binds to the hsp70 HSE in response to different treatments; HSF1 was found to be the main factor responsible for the HSF-HSE signal upon heat shock, whereas HSF2 was more prominently activated upon hemin treatment (23Sistonen L.

These results were the basis for the presumption that HSF1 is the sole stress-responsive factor, and HSF2 activity has been studied mainly during hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells and during mouse embryonic development (23Sistonen L.

HSF1 is activated within minutes of an increase in temperature. The activation is a multistep process, including monomer-to-trimer transition, localization to the nucleus, inducible phosphorylation, and binding to HSEs on both target gene promoters and repetitive chromosomal loci that serve as platforms for the formation of nuclear stress bodies (for reviews see Refs. 6Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 7Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar, 9Pirkkala L.

Similar to HSF1, HSF2 has been shown to translocate to punctuated structures in the nucleus of heat-shocked HeLa cells (35Sheldon L.A. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1549-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we observed that during heat shock, HSF1 and HSF2 co-localize in the nuclear stress bodies, and a direct interaction between HSF1 and HSF2 during both control and heat shock treatment has been demonstrated (36Alastalo T.-P.

Reporter assays have suggested that HSF2 is able to potentiate HSF1-mediated transactivation (37He H. Soncin F. Grammatikakis N. Li Y. Siganou A. Gong J. Brown S.A. Kingston R.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35465-35475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, evidence for a functional relationship between these two factors on endogenous promoters is still missing. Our aim was to elucidate the specific contributions of HSF1 and HSF2 on hsp regulation during heat shock and hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, two conditions suggested to activate mainly HSF1 and HSF2, respectively. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we show that both HSF1 and HSF2 occupy the hsp70 promoter in response to both heat shock and hemin. Complete knock-out or RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of HSF1 markedly affected HSE binding activities, suggesting that HSF1 is able to either directly or indirectly modulate the DNA binding activity of HSF2. Furthermore, we show that an intact HSF1 DNA-binding domain is required to reach maximal levels of HSF2 DNA binding during both hemin-mediated differentiation and heat shock. On the transcriptional level, we demonstrate using real-time RT-PCR analyses on Hsf2–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that HSF2 is able to modulate expression of hsp70, as well as hsp25, hsp40, and hsp110, not only in response to heat shock but also during proteasome inhibition. This study provides novel evidence for a close relationship between the two well conserved transcription factors HSF1 and HSF2 in regulation of hsp expression during stress.

Hemin (Fluka) was used at a final concentration of 40 μm. Heat shock treatments were performed in a 42 °C (K562) or 43 °C (MEFs) water bath. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Peptide Institute Inc.) was used at a concentration of 10 μm for 5 h. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The ChIP protocol was modified from Takahashi et al.

Chromatin samples were fragmented by sonication with Bioruptor (Diagenode) to an approximate size of 500 bp. Immunoprecipitation was performed after preclearing with 50% slurry of protein G-coated Sepharose beads containing bovine serum albumin (100 μg/ml, Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight.

Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated and purchased from Promega or Amersham Biosciences. The blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). RNAi by Small Hairpin RNA (shRNA)—The pSUPER vector (Oligoengine) was used for generating specific hairpin-loop RNA that is processed to functional shRNA in transfected cells (42Brummelkamp T.R.

The pSUPER vector was ligated at BglII and HindIII restriction sites with a double-stranded 64-nucleotide oligonucleotide containing the unique 19-nucleotide sequence from the target transcript both in sense and antisense orientation, separated by a 9-nucleotide spacer sequence (TTCAAGAGA). The double-stranded oligonucleotides were specific for HSF1 (GCT CAT TCA GTT CCT GAT C) or HSF2 (CAG GCG AGT ACA ACA GCA T), and these sequences did not have any significant homology to the other HSFs or any other known genes using BLAST (43Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68338) Google Scholar). The scrambled sequence (GCG CGC TTT GTA GGA TTC G) was used as a control and did not correspond to any known gene in the data bases. The scrambled control vector and the HSF1 and HSF2 shRNA vectors were transfected into K562 cells by electroporation. Cells were incubated for 72 h prior to further treatments. Co-transfection of “RNAi-resistant” HSF1 or HSF2 constructs reversed the biological effects (DNA binding activity as measured by EMSA and Hsp70 protein induction) seen with down-regulation of either HSF1 or HSF2 (data not shown). The RNAi-resistant HSF1 mutants were silently mutated in the shRNA target sequence (underlined nucleotides) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following primer: C GTC AAC AAG CTC ATT CAA TTT CTG ATC TCA CTG GTG CAG. The HSF1 R71A mutant (12Inouye S. Katsuki K. Izu H. Fujimoto M. Sugahara K. Yamada S. Shinkai Y. Oka Y. Katoh Y. Nakai A. Mol. Cell.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSA analysis was performed as described previously (40Mosser D.D. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell extracts were prepared (12 μg of protein) and incubated with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the proximal HSE of the human hsp70.1 promoter, and complexes were separated on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel. Biotin-mediated Oligonucleotide Pulldown Assay—The oligonucleotide assay was performed essentially as described (44Anckar J. Hietakangas V. Denessiouk K. Thiele D.J. Johnson M.S. Sistonen L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Biotinylated oligonucleotides were from Oligomer (Helsinki, Finland). The double-stranded HSE contained the sequence 5′-biotin-AACGAGAATCTTCGAGAATGGCT-3′ and the scrambled control oligonucleotide 5′-biotin-AACGACGGTCGCTCCGCCTGGCT-3′. Buffer C extracts (300–400 μg protein (40Mosser D.D. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar)) were incubated with 0.5 μm annealed oligonucleotide in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Salmon sperm DNA was added (0.5 μg/μl), and proteins were allowed to bind the oligonucleotide for 15 min at room temperature and 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were precleared, and the remaining DNA was precipitated with 15 μl of a 50% slurry of UltraLink streptavidin gel (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C. Bound fractions were washed twice with binding buffer and three times with binding buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100. DNA-bound proteins were eluted with denaturing buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). For each sample, 1 μg of RNA was treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega) and reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus RNase H(–) (Promega). The following primers and probes were used (final concentration indicated in parentheses): hHsp70.1 probe, 5′-FAM TTACACACCTGCTCCAGCTCCTTCCTCTT TAMRA-3′ (0.1 μm), US, 5′-GCCGAGAAGGACGAGTTTGA-3′ (0.4 μm), DS, 5′-CCTGGTACAGTCCGCTGATGA-3′ (0.4 μm); hGAPDH probe, 5′-FAM ACCAGGCGCCCAATACGACCAA TAMRA-3′ (0.1 μm), US, 5′-GTTCGACAGTCAGCCGCATC-3′ (0.3 μm), DS, 5′-GGAATTTGCCATGGGTGGA-3′ (0.3 μm), mHsp70.1 probe, 5′-FAM CATCTCCTGGCTGGACTCCAACACG TAMRA-3′ (0.1 μm), US, 5′-AGGTGCTGGACAAGTGCCAG-3′ (0.3 μm), DS, 5′-AACTCCTCCTTGTCGGCCA-3′ (0.3 μm); mHsp25.1 probe, 5′-FAM ACCGAGAGATGTAGCCATGTTCGTCCTG TAMRA-3′ (0.12 μm), US, 5′-CACTGGCAAGCACGAAGAAAG-3′ (1 μm), DS, 5′-GCGTGTATTTCCGGGTGAAG-3′ (1 μm); mHsp40 probe, 5′-FAM GGAGGAAG Q-3′ (0.15 μm), US, 5′-ACCGCTATGGAGAGGAAGG-3′ (0.4 μm), DS, 5′-GAGGTACCATTAGCACCACCA-3′ (0.4 μm); mHsp110 probe, 5′-FAM CAGAGGCT Q-3′ (0.2μm), US, 5′-ACGCTCAATGCAGACGAAG-3 (0.4μm), DS, 5′-CCGGAGAAAGAATTGCACAC-3′ (0.4 μm); mGAPDH probe, 5′-FAM CAGAAGACTGTGGATGGCCCCTC TAMRA-3′ (0.2 μm), US, 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′ (0.3 μm), DS, 5′-GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3′ (0.3 μm). The hHsp70.1, mHsp70.1, mHsp25.1, and mGAPDH probes were purchased from CyberGene, the hGAPDH probe from MedProbe, and the mHsp40 and mHsp110 probes from Roche Applied Science. Q stands for dark quencher dye (Roche Applied Science). ABsolute QPCR ROX Mix (Advanced Biotechnologies Ltd.) was used to prepare the reaction mixes, and the PCR was performed with ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantities of the hsp mRNAs were normalized against GAPDH, and the fold inductions were determined. For rescue experiments equal amounts of mHSF2-α and mHSF2-β were reintroduced into Hsf2–/– MEFs with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Mock cells were transfected with an empty vector. On the following day cells were subjected to heat shock for 1 h, and hsp mRNAs were analyzed as described above. Both HSF1 and HSF2 Are Recruited to the hsp70 Promoter—The binding of HSF1 and HSF2 to the proximal human hsp70.1 promoter (hereafter hsp70), as illustrated schematically in Fig. 1A, was analyzed in K562 erythroleukemia cells treated with either heat shock or hemin by ChIP. During hemin treatment we observed binding of HSF1 and HSF2 to the hsp70 promoter (Fig. 1B), which is in line with previous studies (23Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I.

Here, we describe the detailed characterization of a functionally homogeneous 1:1 complex of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and cytochrome P450 reductase solubilized via self-assembly in a nanoscale phospholipid bilayer. CYP3A4 in this complex showed a nearly complete conversion from the low- to high-spin state when saturated with testosterone (TS) and no noticeable modulation due to the presence of cytochrome P450 reductase. Global analysis of equilibrium substrate binding and steady-state NADPH consumption kinetics provided precise resolution of the fractional contributions to turnover of CYP3A4 intermediates with one, two, or three TS molecules bound. The first binding event accelerates NADPH consumption but does not result in significant product formation due to essentially complete uncoupling. Binding of the second substrate molecule is critically important for catalysis, as the product formation rate reaches a maximum value with two TS molecules bound, whereas the third binding event significantly improves the coupling efficiency of redox equivalent usage with no further increase in product formation rate. The resolution of the fractional contributions of binding intermediates of CYP3A4 into experimentally observed overall spin shift and the rates of steady-state NADPH oxidation and product formation provide new detailed insight into the mechanisms of cooperativity and allosteric regulation in this human cytochrome P450.

Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) 3The abbreviations used are: CYP3A4, cytochrome P450 3A4; CPR, cytochrome P450 reductase; MSP, membrane scaffold protein; POPC, palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine; TS, testosterone; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. is the most abundant P450 in the human liver (1Guengerich F.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). It is responsible for the metabolism of nearly half of the known drugs as well as many endogenous compounds (2Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2005: 377-530Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Like most mammalian cytochromes P450, CYP3A4 uses molecular dioxygen and reducing equivalents from NADPH to metabolize substrates, coupled through its redox partner cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) (2Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2005: 377-530Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Numerous biophysical and biochemical studies of CYP3A4 have revealed an extremely rich and complex functional landscape, which includes homo- and heterotropic cooperativity, important roles of other protein effectors such as cytochrome b5, and a variety of inhibitors (3Shet M.S. Faulkner K.M. Holmans P.L. Fisher C.W. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4Yamazaki H. Nakano M. Imai Y. Ueng Y.F. Guengerich F.P.

Biophys. 2005; 435: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Possible heterogeneity of detergent-solubilized membrane proteins, the known tendency of CYP3A4 to form oligomers, and the lack of control of protein stoichiometry also make the detailed characterization of reaction steps difficult. As a result, the main kinetic determinants of the CYP3A4 catalytic cycle are less well understood in comparison with its soluble counterparts (7Makris T.M. Denisov I.G. Schlichting I. Sligar S.G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2005: 149-182Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Previous works elucidated the linkage of substrate binding and the thermodynamics of the CYP3A4 reaction cycle (8Domanski T.L. Liu J. Harlow G.R. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem.

Most of the studies of purified CYP3A4 have been hampered by the need for specific additives such as anionic phospholipids and salts (3Shet M.S. Faulkner K.M. Holmans P.L. Fisher C.W. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Imaoka S. Imai Y. Shimada T. Funae Y.

These complex reconstitution conditions and possible sample heterogeneity impede the detailed biophysical characterization of intermediates in the CYP3A4 catalytic cycle. CYP3A4 is known to have a large active site (15Yano J.K. Wester M.R. Schoch G.A. Griffin K.J. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. J. Biol.

A. 2006; 103: 13682-13687Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) and is capable of binding multiple substrate molecules simultaneously. For instance, up to three testosterone molecules can associate with this enzyme. Overall, the experimentally observed functional properties depend on the unknown fractional contribution of the binding intermediates at different saturation levels. Continuous efforts are being made to deconvolute the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of CYP3A4 binding and metabolism of multiple substrate molecules (11Roberts A.G. Campbell A.P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1353-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

The use of a homogeneous population of CYP3A4 solubilized in a nanoscale phospholipid bilayer (Nanodiscs) has allowed the detailed characterization of purely monomeric CYP3A4 in a native membrane environment (18Baas B.J. Denisov I.G. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Nanodiscs represent a discoidal phospholipid bilayer that is encompassed by two amphipathic helical proteins, termed membrane scaffold protein (MSP), and have been used to help stabilize and study several classes of integral membrane proteins (19Civjan N.R.

Nanodiscs allow for self-assembly of membrane-associated target proteins into the phospholipid bilayer with the ability to control the oligomerization state (20Bayburt T.H. Sligar S.G.

Here, we document the first detailed characterization of a catalytically competent unit of CYP3A4 and CPR in a phospholipid bilayer Nanodisc of defined size. This provided the ability to investigate type I spin conversion induced by substrate binding, utilization of reducing equivalents, and coupled metabolism of testosterone. Simultaneous analysis of equilibrium substrate titration and steady-state kinetics of NADPH oxidation was used to characterize the binding intermediates of CYP3A4 and to delineate the functional properties of the enzyme in complex with one, two, and three testosterone molecules bound. From this resulted a clear definition of the cooperativity linkages between spin state, uncoupling, and substrate hydroxylation. Chemicals—Imidazole, sodium cholate, NADPH, testosterone (TS), and androstenedione were purchased from Sigma. 6β-, 2β-, and 15β-OH-TS were from Steraloids, Inc. (Newport, RI). CHAPS was from Anatrace, Inc. (Maumee, OH); Emulgen 913 was from Karlan Research Products Corp. (Santa Rosa, CA); and POPC was from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). All other chemicals were purchased from Fisher, were at least ACS grade, and were used without further purification. MSP1E3D1 Expression, Purification, and Cleavage—MSP1E3D1 was designed using two previously described proteins, MSP1E3 and MSP1D1 (25Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem.

MSP1E3 is an MSP that has been extended by three 22-amino acid α-helices to form Nanodiscs with a larger diameter (25Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). MSP1D1 has a deletion of amino acids 1–11 in the first helix of the MSP, which has been shown not to be a part of the Nanodisc protein/lipid interface (25Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). These two progenitor proteins have been characterized extensively (25Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V.

MSP1E3D1 has an incorporated tobacco etch virus protease site to cleave the histidine affinity tag used for MSP purification. MSP1E3D1 was cloned into the pET-28 plasmid (Novagen), expressed in E. coli BL21-Gold (DE3) cells (Stratagene), and purified as described previously (25Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A.

CYP3A4 was deemed pure by a single band when analyzed by SDS-PAGE with an Rz ratio (A417 nm/A280 nm) of 1.3 or higher. CYP3A4 concentration was measured by carbon monoxy difference spectra as described previously (29Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol.

The rat CPR/pOR262 plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Todd D. Porter (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). CPR purity was ascertained by a single band when analyzed by SDS-PAGE with an Rz ratio (A276 nm/A456 nm) of 8.7 (31Vermilion J.L. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2694-2704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of CPR was measured using the cytochrome c activity assay (32Yasukochi Y. Masters B.S. J. Biol.

Self-Assembly and Purification of CYP3A4 and CPR Nanodiscs—To self-assemble Nanodiscs containing both CYP3A4 and CPR, the proteins at a molar ratio of 1:2 were incubated with 0.1% (v/v) Emulgen 913 for 1 h at room temperature. This mixture was then added to Nanodisc components consisting of cholate-solubilized POPC and MSP1E3D1(–). The phospholipids had been quantitated by inorganic phosphate analysis (34Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 35Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5837) Google Scholar), dried under a stream of nitrogen, and stored overnight in a vacuum desiccator. The final reconstitution molar ratio of all components was 0.1:0.2:240:120:1 CYP3A4/CPR/cholate/POPC/MSP1E3D1(–)). One Nanodisc was formed by two MSP1E3D1(–) molecules and 240 POPC molecules. Thus, on average, the assembly mixture produced an excess of bare Nanodiscs statistically favoring the formation of a single CYP3A4·CPR complex in the Nanodisc. Once the total reconstitution mixture was added at the appropriate ratios, it was incubated for 45 min at room temperature and then placed on ice for an additional 1 h. To remove the detergents and concomitantly initiate the self-assembly process, a 60-fold excess of Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) was added. The Bio-Bead SM-2 excess was calculated based on the known adsorption rate and capacity of the Bio-Beads SM-2 (18Baas B.J. Denisov I.G. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 36Holloway P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 37Bonomo E.A. Swaney J.B. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 380-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Nakano R. Konami H. Sato H. Ito O. Shimizu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This complex mixture was then incubated on ice for an additional 2 h. The formed Nanodisc assemblies were removed from the Bio-Beads SM-2 and filtered through a 33-mm 0.22 μm syringe filter (Millipore Corp.). As a result, several populations of Nanodiscs were formed, viz. Nanodiscs that contained no proteins except MSP, Nanodiscs that contained a single protein (either CYP3A4 or CPR), and Nanodiscs that contained both target proteins. The Nanodisc mixture was then injected onto a calibrated Superdex 200 HR 10/30 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 100 mm NaCl and connected to a Waters HPLC system with a photodiode array detector at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The Nanodisc fraction was pooled before further purification. The whole Nanodisc fractions that contained proteins and the empty Nanodiscs were then applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column (0.6 × 3.5 cm; Qiagen Inc.) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 100 mm NaCl. The nickel affinity column selectively bound CYP3A4 incorporated into Nanodiscs and induced separation from empty Nanodiscs and Nanodiscs containing CPR alone. The column was then washed with 5 column volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 15 mm imidazole. This step was necessary to remove any Nanodiscs with nonspecific interactions with the Ni-NTA resin. The nickel affinity column was then eluted with 5 column volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole, and the colored fractions were pooled. The pooled fractions were directly loaded onto a 2′,5′-ADP-agarose column (0.6 × 2.5 cm; Sigma) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 100 mm NaCl. CPR bound to the 2′,5′-ADP column and Nanodiscs containing only CYP3A4, but not CPR flow-through fractions. This column was then washed with the equilibration buffer and eluted with the same buffer containing 2.5 mm 2′-AMP. The samples were fully purified and dialyzed against 1000-fold volume of 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol with three buffer exchanges every 6–8 h. All purification samples were then re-injected onto a calibrated Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column with proteins of known size and retention time and also analyzed by SDS-PAGE to verify the fidelity of the purification techniques. In theory, assembling two proteins into a Nanodisc could result in both proteins being on the same side of the 2-fold symmetric bilayer, or, on the other hand, the two proteins could occupy opposite sides. It has been suggested that, for integral membrane proteins that have a measurable affinity for each other, the self-assembly dynamics favor pre-association prior to collection of phospholipids and the final structure of the encircling MSP belt (23Bayburt T.H. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 450: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Although it is experimentally very difficult to rule out a small amount of Nanodiscs with CPR and CYP3A4 on opposite sides of the bilayer, the homogeneous nature of the final analytical size exclusion chromatogram suggests a single hydrodynamic radius of the particle. Spectral Characterization of CYP3A4 and CPR Nanodiscs—The absorption spectra of the fully purified CYP3A4·CPR Nanodiscs were measured from 250 to 700 nm using a Cary 300 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) in a self-masking cuvette (2 × 10 mm; NSG Precision Cells, Inc., Farmingdale, NY) with a sample volume of 400 μl. The spectra of CYP3A4·CPR Nanodiscs were then fitted to the basis set of the known molar spectra of each of the protein components using the left division subroutine in MATLAB (The Math-Works, Inc., Natick, MA) to determine the concentrations of the protein components. The results reported were averaged over seven experimental preparations. TS Type I Binding to CYP3A4·Reductase Nanodiscs—TS binding titrations used CYP3A4·CPR Nanodiscs in the Cary Bio 300 UV-visible spectrophotometer with a Peltier thermostat maintaining the temperature at 37 °C. Titrations were carried out in a self-masking cuvette (2 × 10 mm) containing 400 μlof 0.5 μm CYP3A4·CPR Nanodiscs in 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. TS was added from a 20 mm stock solution in methanol in 0.25-μl increments from 0 to 75 μm TS with a 0.5-μl syringe, in 0.5-μl increments from 75 to 150 μm, and in 1.0-μl increments from 150 to 247 μm with a 1-μl syringe. The final methanol concentration was 1.2% at the highest TS concentration measured. The CYP3A4·CPR Nanodiscs were then assayed using carbon monoxy difference spectra with the addition of sodium dithionite- and carbon monoxide-saturated buffer, and the sample showed no measurable signs of conversion to cytochrome P420. NADPH Oxidation with CYP3A4·CPR Nanodiscs—The NADPH oxidation rate was measured by monitoring absorption at 340 nm using the Cary Bio 300 UV-visible spectrophotometer at 37 °C. NADPH oxidation measurements were performed with 400 μl of sample containing 30 pmol of CYP3A4·CPR Nanodiscs in 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were equilibrated at 37 °C for 2 min with different concentrations of TS from 0 to 200 μm, and then 60 nmol of NADPH was added from a 20 mm stock solution. The rate of NADPH consumption was calculated from the absorption changes at 340 nm monitored for 6 min using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm–1 cm–1. The data are an average of three or more experimental data sets. TS Metabolism with CYP3A4·CPR Nanodiscs—TS metabolism was measured using 30 pmol of CYP3A4·CPR Nanodiscs with different concentrations of TS (30–240 μm) from a 20 mm stock solution in methanol. The resultant small concentrations of methanol in the final assay mixture had no noticeable effect. The buffer contained 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The 500-μl samples were equilibrated at 37 °C for 2 min, and then 700 nmol of NADPH was added to each reaction. After different time points (1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 min), the reactions were quenched with 2 ml of dichloromethane. The reaction progress was linear over this timeframe. All samples had 20 nmol of androstenedione added as an internal standard. The quenched samples were extracted and dried under a stream of nitrogen. The dried samples were resuspended in 200 μl of methanol (Optima, Fisher) and loaded onto a Waters Nova-Pak C18 column (3.9 × 150 mm) connected to a Waters HPLC system with a photodiode array detector at a flow rate 0.75 ml/min. The TS and metabolites were monitored at 240 nm with a gradient of methanol/water/acetonitrile (39:60:1 to 80:18:2) over 55 min (39Arlotto M.P. Trant J.M. Estabrook R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The amount of products was calculated using authentic standards of 2β-, 6β-, and 15β-OH-TS and androstenedione as a reference. The identification of 1β-OH-TS was surmised from published elution profiles of TS metabolism and relative elution times (39Arlotto M.P. Trant J.M. Estabrook R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 40Krauser J.A. Voehler M. Tseng L.-H. Schefer A.B. Godejohann M. Guengerich F.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3962-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and quantitation was calculated using the integration areas of 2β-OH-TS because 1β-OH-TS was not commercially available. All chromatographic base-line correction and integration calculations were done using GRAMS/AI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA). The data were an average of three or more data sets. Data Analysis and Fitting—To compare the experimental data obtained for CYP3A4 in 1:1 complex with CPR in Nanodiscs with previous results, the data were initially analyzed using the Hill equation. Analysis of the spectral titration of CYP3A4 in Nanodiscs with and without CPR was performed using singular value decomposition as described previously (18Baas B.J. Denisov I.G. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 430: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For each experiment, all absorption spectra of CYP3A4 measured at 37 °C between 350 and 700 nm in the presence of different TS concentrations were corrected for the dilution factor and combined into the matrix. Singular value decomposition of this spectral matrix revealed that the data are described by two spectral components, with the second one corresponding to the difference spectrum of low and high ferric CYP3A4. The third singular value was always <3%. The resulting singular concentration vector corresponding to the transition of CYP3A4 from low to high spin as a function of TS concentration was fitted to the Hill equation: F=Sn/(Ksn+Sn), where F is the normalized fraction of high-spin shift caused by TS binding, S is the substrate concentration, Ks is the spectral dissociation constant, and n is the Hill coefficient. The parameters obtained for TS binding did not depend on the presence of CPR in Nanodiscs. The same Hill equation was used for the analysis of concentration dependence of the TS turnover rate in CYP3A4·CPR Nanodiscs. The turnover numbers (expressed as nanomoles of total product formed per min/nmol of CYP3A4 and measured in multiple experiments) were fitted to the following equation: v=Vmax Sn/(S50n+Sn), where S50 is the substrate concentration at which the turnover rate is half of the maximum rate observed at the highest TS concentration. Because of the limitations of Hill analysis and the lack of mechanistic information provided by the Hill coefficient, the experimental data were also analyzed globally using the reaction shown in Scheme 1. The experimentally observed dependence of different properties of CYP3A4 on the substrate concentration is represented as a linear combination of corresponding signals from substrate-free cytochrome as well as enzyme molecules with one, two, or three TS molecules bound, distributed over multiple possible microscopic configurations and averaged over time. In total, three enzyme·substrate complexes must be used in this global analysis because it was impossible to adequately describe all available data with only one or two TS molecules bound to CYP3A4. Each of these binding intermediates is characterized by a specific fraction of high-spin state, the steady-state rate of NADPH oxidation, and the rate of product formation. The overall signal measured at the given TS concentration is determined by the fractions of these enzyme·substrate complexes, which are in turn defined by the stepwise dissociation constants (Ki, i = 1, 2, 3) corresponding to the partial equilibria between species with different numbers of bound substrate molecules (Scheme 1), E+S↔K1ES+S↔K2ES2+S↔K3ES3SCHEME 1 where E is the concentration of substrate-free CYP3A4, S is the substrate concentration, and ESi is the concentration of binding intermediates, i.e. complexes of CYP3A4 with i molecules of substrate TS bound, where i = 1, 2, 3. Simultaneous analysis of CYP3A4 titration curves and NADPH consumption rates as a function of TS concentration was performed using internally consistent fitting parameters for both data sets, viz. the Ki (41Beechem J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Data sets were normalized with respect to their maximum values to ensure equal statistical weight in the fitting procedure; S.E. values were estimated from the multiple experiments (from three to seven independent preparations). Fractions of the enzyme·substrate complexes containing different number of TS molecules bound to one molecule of CYP3A4 were expressed using standard binding polynomials (Equation 1) (18Baas B.J.

Humans with a germline point mutation of CASPASE-8 have multiple defects in T cells, B cells, and NK cells, most notably attenuated activation and immunodeficiency. By generating mice with B-cell-specific inactivation of caspase-8 (bcasp8-/-), we show that caspase-8 is dispensable for B-cell development, but its loss in B cells results in attenuated antibody production upon in vivo viral infection. We also report an important role for caspase-8 in maintaining B-cell survival following stimulation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)2, -3, and -4. In response to TLR4 stimulation, caspase-8 is recruited to a complex containing IKKαβ, and its loss resulted in delayed NFκB nuclear translocation and impaired NFκB transcriptional activity.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). During DR signaling, procaspase-8 is recruited to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), where oligomerization drives its own activation by self-cleavage to form an activated caspase-8 tetramer complex in a process termed “proximity-induced activation” (5Boatright K.M. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2003; : 233-242PubMed Google Scholar). Once activated, caspase-8 mediates apoptosis through a cell-specific type I or type II DR pathway. In type I cells, active caspase-8 at the DISC can directly process and activate caspase-3, leading to apoptosis. In type II cells, caspase-8 processes the BH3-only molecule Bid to form a truncated Bid molecule that translocates to the mitochondrial membrane and triggers cell death through the mitochondria (6Barnhart B.C. Alappat E.C. Peter M.E. Semin Immunol. 2003; 15: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In addition to their apoptotic roles, a new paradigm for caspases in non-apoptotic roles has become clear. In various studies, activation of caspases was detected in non-apoptotic-activated lymphocytes (7Kennedy N.J. Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Exp.

Until recently, embryonic lethality prevented the generation and phenotypic characterization of adult mice missing caspase-8, necessitating tissue-specific inactivation (19Varfolomeev E.E.

We recently reported the conditional inactivation of caspase-8 in the T-cell lineage (tcasp8-/-) and identified important novel non-apoptotic roles for caspase-8 in maintaining peripheral T-cell homeostasis, in mediating expansion of T-cells upon in vitro activation, and in inducing an effective in vivo T-cell immune response against viral infections (20Salmena L. Lemmers B. Hakem A. Matysiak-Zablocki E. Murakami K. Au P.Y. Berry D.M. Tamblyn L. Shehabeldin A. Migon E. Wakeham A. Bouchard D. Yeh W.C. McGlade J.C. Ohashi P.S. Hakem R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Studies of human patients with a caspase-8 point mutation also support a non-apoptotic role for caspase-8. These patients are immunodeficient, show reduced activation of B, T, and NK cells in vitro, exhibit decreased levels of circulating antibodies and impaired immunoglobulin production in response to antigenic stimulation (22Chun H.J. Zheng L. Ahmad M. Wang J. Speirs C.K. Siegel R.M. Dale J.K. Puck J. Davis J. Hall C.G. Skoda-Smith S. Atkinson T.P. Straus S.E. Lenardo M.J. Nature. 2002; 419: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Impaired activation of T, B, and NK cells from these patients was associated with defective NFκB nuclear translocation (23Su H. Bidere N. Zheng L. Cubre A. Sakai K. Dale J. Salmena L. Hakem R. Straus S. Lenardo M. Science. 2005; 307: 1465-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In response to TCR stimulation of T cells, caspase-8 contributes to the formation of the activation receptor-induced signalosome (ARIS) that contains CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 and the IκB kinase (IKK) complexes. Loss of caspase-8 impairs ARIS formation leading to defective NFκB signaling in response to TCR stimulation. Toll-like receptors are important components of innate immunity and provide a first-line of defense against microbial infections. Binding of specific TLRs by their appropriate antigens activates B cells, induces their antigen-presenting ability, and stimulates the production of neutralizing antibodies (24Vos Q. Lees A. Wu Z.Q. Snapper C.M. Mond J.J. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 154-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 25Hoebe K. Janssen E. Beutler B. Nat.

Akira S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). Examples of such antigens activating specific TLRs are: bacterial lipoprotein for TLR2, double-stranded viral RNA (or analog, poly(I:C)) for TLR3, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for TLR4, flagellin for TLR5, single-stranded DNA for TLR7, and unmethylated CpG DNA for TLR9 (13Krakauer T.

In this study, we have investigated the roles of caspase-8 in development, apoptosis, and proliferation of B lymphocytes. As expected, caspase-8-deficient B cells were resistant to CD95-mediated killing; however unlike T lymphocytes (20Salmena L. Lemmers B. Hakem A. Matysiak-Zablocki E. Murakami K. Au P.Y. Berry D.M. Tamblyn L. Shehabeldin A. Migon E. Wakeham A. Bouchard D. Yeh W.C. McGlade J.C. Ohashi P.S. Hakem R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), we found that caspase-8 is not required for development and homeostasis of B lymphocytes. Our study identifies an impaired response of caspase-8-deficient B cells to TLR4 and links this defect to a delayed nuclear translocation of NFκB, and defective transcription of its target genes in the absence of caspase-8. We also report that loss of caspase-8 leads to reduced phosphorylation of p65 at serine 536, which is known to regulate p65 nuclear translocation (34Mattioli I. Sebald A. Bucher C. Charles R.P. Nakano H. Doi T. Kracht M. Schmitz M.L. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6336-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Finally, in response to TLR4 stimulation, caspase-8 was found to be transiently recruited to a complex that contains IKKαβ thereby placing this caspase in a signaling complex important for cell survival and immune responses. Mice—Casp8-conditional mutant mice (20Salmena L. Lemmers B. Hakem A. Matysiak-Zablocki E. Murakami K. Au P.Y. Berry D.M. Tamblyn L. Shehabeldin A. Migon E. Wakeham A. Bouchard D. Yeh W.C. McGlade J.C. Ohashi P.S. Hakem R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) were intercrossed with CD19Cre transgenic mice (35Rickert R.C. Roes J. Rajewsky K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1317-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) to obtain bcasp8 mice. All mice studied were in a mixed 129/J × C57BL/6 genetic background and were genotyped by PCR (primer sequences and PCR conditions available upon request). Controls used in the different experiments correspond to either wild-type, casp8fl/wt CD19-Cre, or CD19-Cre mice. The former two genotypes produced similar results compared with the wild-type controls. Mice used for each experiment were littermates. All experiments were performed in compliance within the Ontario Cancer Institute Animal Care Committee Guidelines. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Single cell suspensions prepared from thymus, spleen, lymph lodes (cervical, inguinal, axillary, brachial, and inguinal lymph nodes were pooled), and bone marrow from mice 8–12 weeks of age were stained with antibody at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The following antibodies were used to analyze cell populations: anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-Thy.1, anti-B220, anti-CD43, anti-IgM, anti-IgD, anti-CD21/35, and anti-CD23. Lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScalibur; Becton Dickinson) with CellQuest software (Applied Biosystems). Cells were sorted using a FACSVantage flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). B-cell Purification and Thymidine Incorporation—For all the experiments, B cells were purified by negative selection or selected by activated cell sorting (FACS). For negative selection, splenocytes were subjected to red blood cell lysis, depleted of macrophages using anti-rat IgG magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Dynal) following anti-CD11b and anti-Gr-1 (eBioscience) labeling. T cells were eliminated using anti-Thy 1.2-bound magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Dynal). All B-cell experiments were performed with purified B cells with a purity ≥90%, LPS (10, 1 and 0.1 μg/ml) (serotype 0111:B4; 055:B5; Sigma), CPG (1 μg/ml) (Coley Pharmaceutical ODN 1826/2138), and poly(IC) (100 μg/ml) (invivoGen). Cells were harvested at 24 or 48 h after an 18-h pulse with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) (Amersham Biosciences), and incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured with a Matrix 96 direct β-counter system (Canberra Packard). Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and ultrapure LPS (invivoGen) were used at 10 μg/ml and 5 μg/ml, respectively. Cell Cycle and CFSE Analysis—For cell cycle analysis, purified B cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with 5 μg/ml of propidium iodide as previously described (20Salmena L. Lemmers B. Hakem A. Matysiak-Zablocki E. Murakami K. Au P.Y. Berry D.M. Tamblyn L. Shehabeldin A. Migon E. Wakeham A. Bouchard D. Yeh W.C. McGlade J.C. Ohashi P.S. Hakem R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Purified splenic B cells (106) were collected in serum-free medium and incubated with CFSE (Molecular Probes-5 μm) at 37 °C for 10 min. Following three washes in Iscove's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, the CFSE-labeled cells were stimulated for 24, 48, and 72 h with LPS (10 μg/ml). For each time point, cells were stained for survival using 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-ADD), and the levels of CFSE incorporation determined by FACS analysis. Apoptosis—Purified B cells were stimulated with anti-IgM +IL4 (20 μg/ml, 5 ng/ml) for 3 days and then with CD95L (recombinant hCD8-mCD95L fusion protein 1 μg/ml) with or without cycloheximide (0.1 μg/ml) for 24 h. Apoptosis and cell death were measured after treatment using Annexin-V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection kit (R&D Systems) or 7-AAD (Sigma). Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Infections—Mice were immunized with VSV-Indiana (2 × 106 PFU, intravenously). After 4, 8, and 12 days post-infection, sera were collected, and neutralizing IgM and IgG immunoglobulin titers determined as described (36Fehr T. Lopez-Macias C. Odermatt B. Torres R.M. Schubart D.B. O'Keefe T.L. Matthias P. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Cells (105) were used for cytospin centrifugation. Cytospin specimens of B cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with 1:50 dilution of anti-p65 Ab (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 45 min at room temperature. Labeling was revealed using anti-rabbit-conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson Immunoresearch). Cells were stained with Hoescht for 5 min and then mounted with Fluoromount (Southern Biotec). Images were collected on a Leica TCS-NT/SP confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) using a ×63 oil immersion objective NA 1.32, zoom X. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Total protein extracts from purified B cells were prepared as previously described (20Salmena L. Lemmers B. Hakem A. Matysiak-Zablocki E. Murakami K. Au P.Y. Berry D.M. Tamblyn L. Shehabeldin A. Migon E. Wakeham A. Bouchard D. Yeh W.C. McGlade J.C. Ohashi P.S. Hakem R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed using protein A-Sepharose following incubation of cell extracts with anti-IKKαβ (H-470, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-caspase-8 (epitope SNKDDRRNKGKQMP; amino acids 453–466 of murine caspase-8) antibodies. Optimal Ab concentrations and conditions for immunoprecipitation were determined in pilot studies. The separation of cytosol and nucleus was performed as previously described (23Su H. Bidere N. Zheng L. Cubre A. Sakai K. Dale J. Salmena L. Hakem R. Straus S. Lenardo M. Science. 2005; 307: 1465-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Novex). The following antibodies were used for Western blotting in 5% powdered milk (Carnation) in PBS-T: rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-8 (epitope SNKDDRRNKGKQMP; amino acids 453–466 of murine caspase-8), rat monoclonal anti-caspase-8 antibody (kindly provided by Dr. A Strasser), anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, anti-phospho-IKBα, anti-IKBα, anti-PARP, anti-phospho-p65 (S536), and anti-β-actin (Sigma), and anti-NFkB-p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C-20). Real Time PCR—Cell-sorted B cells were stimulated with LPS (10 μg/ml) for 0, 2, 4, and 7 h. Cells were harvested, and total RNA was made using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was made using the Invitrogen kit. The SYBR green kit from Applied Biosystems was used for real time PCR. The following oligonucleotides were used for real time PCR: GADPH (5′-AACAGGAAGCCCATCACCATCTT-3′ and 5′-GCCCTTCCACAATGCCAAAGTT-3′); TNF-α (5′-CCCTCACACTCAGATCATCTTCT-3′ and 5′-GCTACGACGTGGGCTACAG-3′); IL6 (5′-TAGTCCTTCCTACCCCAATTTCC-3′ and 5′-TTGGTCCTTAGCCACTCCTTC-3′), INF-β (5′-CAGCTCCAAGAAAGGACGAAC-3′and 5′-GGCAGTGTAACTCTTCTGCAT-3′) and IP10 (5′-CCAAGTGCTGCCGTCATTTTC-3′and 5′-GGCTCGCAGGGATGATTTCAA-3′). All PCR was performed on the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR System. To study the function of caspase-8 in B lymphocytes, mice carrying the caspase-8 mutation targeted to the B-cell lineage (casp8fl/fl;CD19Cre, also called bcasp8-/-) were generated by crossing mice homozygous for the caspase-8-floxed allele (casp8fl/fl) (20Salmena L. Lemmers B. Hakem A. Matysiak-Zablocki E. Murakami K. Au P.Y. Berry D.M. Tamblyn L. Shehabeldin A. Migon E. Wakeham A. Bouchard D. Yeh W.C. McGlade J.C. Ohashi P.S. Hakem R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) with mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the B-cell-specific CD19 promoter (CD19Cre) (35Rickert R.C. Roes J. Rajewsky K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1317-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis indicated the highly efficient deletion of caspase-8 gene in purified peripheral B cells from bcasp8-/- mice (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis of serial dilutions of protein extracts prepared from purified B cells confirmed the loss of caspase-8 protein in bcasp8-/- cells (Fig. 1B). Analysis by flow cytometry of cell subpopulations in bone marrow (BM), spleen, and lymph nodes (LN) did not show any differences between bcasp8-/- mice and control littermates (Fig. 1C and data not shown). The proportion of T and B cells in LN and spleens and total lymphocyte numbers in thymus, spleen, LN, and BM were similar in control and bcasp8-/- mice (Fig. 1D and data not shown). Therefore, unlike its function in the T-cell lineage, caspase-8 is not essential for the maintenance of B-lymphocyte homeostasis. To confirm the functional deletion of caspase-8, we assessed the sensitivity of casp8-/- B cells to CD95-induced apoptosis. Purified peripheral B cells were activated in vitro for 3 days with anti-IgM/IL4, and then treated with Fas ligand, in the presence or absence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis known to potentiate Fas killing (37Barnhart B.C. Pietras E.M. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Salmena L. Sayama K. Hakem R. Peter M.E. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Annexin-V/PI staining demonstrated that while B cells from control mice were sensitive to CD95-induced killing, bcasp8-/- cells were resistant (Fig. 1E). These results confirm the essential role for caspase-8 in DR-mediated cell death. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection in mice induces a primary infection phase, which consists of a T-cell-independent response characterized by the production of neutralizing IgM antibodies by B cells. The second phase of the infection, which is T-cell-dependent, leads to the production of IgG immunoglobulin (36Fehr T. Lopez-Macias C. Odermatt B. Torres R.M. Schubart D.B. O'Keefe T.L. Matthias P. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 38Fehr T. Bachmann M.F. Bluethmann H. Kikutani H. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 168: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We investigated the role of caspase-8 in the in vivo B-cell response to VSV infection. Control and bcasp8-/- mice were subjected to intravenous immunization with 2 × 106 PFU of VSV, and the production of VSV-neutralizing IgM and IgG antibodies was measured 4, 8, and 12 days later (39Bertram E.M. Tafuri A. Shahinian A. Chan V.S. Hunziker L. Recher M. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Watts T.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). While the levels of IgM antibodies directed against VSV were not affected in bcasp8-/- mice, the production of VSV-neutralizing IgG was reduced in bcasp8-/- mice (Fig. 2). This finding is consistent with the increased susceptibility of human patients deficient for caspase-8 to viral infections (22Chun H.J. Zheng L. Ahmad M. Wang J. Speirs C.K. Siegel R.M. Dale J.K. Puck J. Davis J. Hall C.G. Skoda-Smith S. Atkinson T.P. Straus S.E. Lenardo M.J. Nature. 2002; 419: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that caspase-8 deficiency in B cells leads to impaired in vivo responses to VSV infection. B cells are essential components of the innate immune response against microbial infection (24Vos Q. Lees A. Wu Z.Q. Snapper C.M. Mond J.J. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 154-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). TLR signaling is important for the activation of B cells and other components of the immune response by microbes (40Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (3337) Google Scholar). Given the connection between DISC components and TLR signaling (29Bannerman D.D. Tupper J.C. Kelly J.D. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30Bannerman D.D. Eiting K.T. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. Am. J.

Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of caspase-8 deficiency on TLR signaling. This was accomplished by treating purified B-cell populations with antigens specific for different TLRs. B-cell expansion was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation following treatment with increasing doses of different Escherichia coli-derived LPS, ultrapure LPS, CpG, LTA, or poly (I:C) to identify TLR4, TLR9, TLR2, and TLR3 responses, respectively. Whereas the stimulation by CpG consistently produced similar B-cell expansion in the control and bcasp8-/- backgrounds, responses of casp8-/- B cells to poly(I:C), LPS (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S1), and LTA (supplemental Fig. S2) were reduced compared with controls, demonstrating that caspase-8 does indeed play a role in TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 signaling. Similarly, CFSE labeling indicated defective expansion of casp8-/- B cells in response to LPS and poly(I:C) stimulation (Fig. 3B and data not shown). These defects could not be attributed to reduce TLR3 and TLR4 protein levels in bcaps8-/- cells as their cell surface expression levels comparable to controls (data not shown). No major defect in proliferation of bcasp8-/- B cells was observed in response to anti-IgM, anti-IgM, and IL4, or anti-IgM and anti-CD40 compared with wild-type controls (data not shown). Cell cycle and cell death were analyzed in response to TLR4 stimulation to characterize the lack of expansion of LPS-stimulated casp8-/- B cells. Based on the PI-stained cell cycle profiles and the quantification of the sub-G1 population, the defective expansion of casp8-/- B cells in response to TLR4 stimulation was attributed to increased cell death (Fig. 4A). Annexin-V/PI staining experiments were also performed and indicated that the increased cell death of TLR4 stimulated casp8-/- B cells was attributed to apoptosis (Fig. 4B). Apoptotic cell death was further confirmed by electron microscopy (Fig. 4, C–F) and increased caspase-3 processing in LPS-stimulated casp8-/- B cells compared with controls (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that caspase-8 is required for the activation of B cells and maintaining their survival in response to TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation. Upon ligand binding, TLRs initiate signaling cascades that culminate in nuclear translocation of NFκB, and transcriptional activation of NFκB target genes (41Zhang G. Ghosh S. J. Endotoxin. Res. 2000; 6: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 42Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6684) Google Scholar, 43Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5569) Google Scholar). NFκB protein members include a family of Rel domain-containing proteins; e.g. p65 (Rel A), Rel B, c-Rel, p50 (NF-B1), and p52 (NF-B2) (44Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). Activation and nuclear translocation of NFκB result in increased transcription of its target genes such as TNF-α, IL6, IL1-α, IL12p40, and INF-β (45Takeda K. Akira S. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2004; 34: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The IKK complex, composed of IKKα, β, and γ or NEMO plays an important role in mediating NFκB nuclear translocation in response to TLR ("

Both PIF and angiotensin II were shown to induce autophosphorylation of the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), and an inhibitor of this enzyme completely attenuated the depression in protein synthesis and prevented the induction of eIF2α phosphorylation. The PKR inhibitor also completely attenuated the increase in protein degradation induced by PIF and angiotensin II and prevented the increase in proteasome expression and activity. To confirm these results myotubes were transfected with plasmids that express either wild-type PKR, or a catalytically inactive PKR variant, PKRΔ6. Myotubes expressing PKRΔ6 showed no increase in eIF2α phosphorylation in response to PIF or angiotensin II, no depression in protein synthesis, and no increase in protein degradation or increase in proteasome expression. Induction of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by PIF and angiotensin II has been linked to activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Inhibition of PKR prevented nuclear migration of NF-κB in response to both PIF and angiotensin II, by preventing degradation of the inhibitor protein I-κB. Phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2α was also significantly increased in the gastrocnemius muscle of weight losing mice bearing the MAC16 tumor, suggesting that a similar process may be operative in cancer cachexia. These results provide a link between the depression of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and the increase in protein degradation.

Muscle atrophy is a characteristic feature of cancer cachexia, and the degree of muscle loss has been correlated with the reduced survival rates of cancer patients (1Nixon D.W. Heymsfield S.B.

Muscle mass is determined by both the rates of protein synthesis and degradation. Emery et al. (2Emery P.W. Edwards R.H.T. Rennie M.J. Souhami R.L. Halliday D. Br. Med. J. 1984; 289: 584-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) have suggested that muscle mass in cancer cachexia is regulated primarily by alterations in the protein synthetic rate, while changes in protein degradation are largely secondary. However, both a reduced rate of protein synthesis and an increased rate of degradation were observed in muscle biopsies from newly diagnosed cancer patients with weight loss (3Lundholm K. Bylund A.C. Holm J. Schersten T. Eur. J. Cancer. 1976; 12: 465-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Changes in muscle protein synthesis and degradation rate in cancer cachexia probably arise from the presence of tumor-derived factors, such as proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF), 2The abbreviations used are: PIF, proteolysis-inducing factor; Ang II, angiotensin II; eIF2α, eukaryotic initiation factor 2; PKR, RNA-dependent protein kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IKK, I-κB kinase; I-κB, inhibitor protein-κB; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PKRI, 8-[1-(1H-imidozol-4-yl)meth-(Z)-ylidene]-6,8-dihydrothiazol[5,4-e]indol-7-one; PKC, protein kinase C; EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid. or increased production of endogenous factors, such as cytokines or Ang II.

Both agents stimulate protein degradation through an increased expression and activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway (7Lorite M.J. Smith H.J. Arnold J.A. Morris A. Thompson M.G.

Tisdale M.J. Cell. Signal. 2005; 18: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) protein degradation is inhibited by specific proteasome inhibitors, while mutations in IκBα, which prevent activation of NF-κB and the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (9Wyke S.M. Tisdale M.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2005; 92: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), also inhibit protein degradation by PIF, confirming a causal relationship. Much less is known about how these agents affect protein synthesis, although with PIF, at least, this has been suggested to arise from an effect on translation efficiency (4Smith H.J. Lorite M.J. Tisdale M.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5507-5513PubMed Google Scholar). There are two points of control on initiation of protein translation, binding of the initiator methionyl-tRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit, and binding of mRNA to the 43 S ribosomal subunit. This study will concentrate on the first mechanism. Binding of methionyl-tRNA to the ribosomal subunit occurs as a tertiary complex with eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and GTP (10Price N. Proud C. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 476: 748-760Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). eIF2 is released in its GDP-bound state and to return to the GTP form the GDP is exchanged for GTP in a reaction catalyzed by the guanine exchange factor eIF-2B (11Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7928-7934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This recycling of GTP can be inhibited by phosphorylation of eIF2 on its α-subunit, sequestering eIF-2B with GDP, so that it is not available to catalyze nucleotide exchange on non-phosphorylated eIF2 (12Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian cells possess four different eIF2α kinases, double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase (PKR), heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI), PERK and the yeast GCN2 (13Proud C.G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Each of these kinases respond to distinct stress conditions that affect transcription and protein synthesis. eIF2α phosphorylation has been shown to be central to activation of NF-κB (14Jiang H.Y.

Biol. 2003; 23: 5651-5663Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), while PKR has been shown to activate I-κB kinase (IKK), leading to degradation of the inhibitors I-κBα and I-κBβ and the concomitant release of NF-κB (15Zamanian-Daryoush M. Mogensen T.H. DiDonato J.A. Williams B.R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1278-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Thus eIF2α phosphorylation might provide a link between the depression of protein synthesis and the increase in protein degradation observed in skeletal muscle of cachectic subjects. This study examines the mechanism for the depression of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle by both PIF and Ang II using murine myotubes as a surrogate model. It confirms the importance of eIF2α phosphorylation in the depression of protein synthesis by both agents and provides a mechanism for activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway and increased muscle protein degradation, through activation of NF-κB by a PKR-dependent process.

Mouse monoclonal antibody to myosin heavy chain was from Novocastra (Newcastle, UK) and to I-κBα was from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Anti-PIF monoclonal antibody was produced as described (16Todorov P.T. McDevitt T.M. Cariuk P. Coles B. Deacon M. Tisdale M.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1256-1261PubMed Google Scholar).

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) kits were from Panomics (Redwood City, CA). The method for the transplantation of the MAC16 tumor has been described (9Wyke S.M. Tisdale M.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2005; 92: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). All animal experiments were approved by the British Home Office, and the ethical guidelines that were followed meet the standards required by the United Kingdom Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research guidelines. The plasmid vector pcDNA3(–) containing wild-type PKR and the catalytically inactive variant PKRΔ6 were a gift from Dr G. N. Barber (University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL). PKRΔ6 lacks six amino acids (361–366) between catalytic domains IV and V, which render the PKR variant unable to autophosphorylate or activate substrate proteins (17Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katez M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was purified using WIZARD Magnesil™ purification kit (Promega, Southampton, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The authenticity of the plasmids was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis (Birmingham University, Birmingham, UK). Primers for PCR analysis were purchased from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Transformation of Bacteria—E. coli DH5α were transformed with pcDNA3 plasmids containing wild-type PKR and the catalytically inactive variant PKRΔ6, as well as empty vector using heat shock and selected with ampicillin (50 μg/ml). PCR analysis was employed to confirm that the plasmids contained an insert of the correct size, and the authenticity of the inserts was confirmed by sequence analysis. Plasmid DNA was extracted from positive colonies grown overnight in LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml). Cell Culture and Transfection—C2C12 murine myoblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin under an atmosphere of 10% CO2 in air at 37 °C. When the myoblasts reached confluence they were allowed to fuse to form myotubes by replacing the propagation medium with DMEM containing 2% horse serum, with medium changes every 2 days. Differentiation was complete within 5–7 days, and cells were used experimentally within 4 days of differentiation. Myotubes were maintained in unsupplemented DMEM without phenol red for 18 h prior to experimentation. For transfection myoblasts were seeded at a density such that they reached 50–60% confluence the next day. Plasmid DNA (8 μg) in 0.5 ml reduced serum medium was mixed with 20 μl of Lipofectamine in 0.5 ml of medium, and the DNA and Lipofectamine were combined, mixed gently, and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The complex was added to myoblasts in a 20-cm2 flask containing 5 ml of medium without antibiotics, and the cells were incubated for 24 h before dilution and incubation for a further 24 h in medium without antibiotics. Transfected cells were selected for growth in neomycin (50 μg/ml) for 48–72 h. Myotubes were formed by allowing confluent cultures of myoblasts to fuse as above. Purification of PIF—PIF was purified from solid MAC16 tumors excised from mice with a weight loss between 20 and 25% as described previously (16Todorov P.T. McDevitt T.M. Cariuk P. Coles B. Deacon M. Tisdale M.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1256-1261PubMed Google Scholar). Tumors were homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at a concentration of 5 mg/g tumor. Protein was precipitated by the addition of 40% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, and the supernatant was subjected to affinity chromatography using anti-PIF monoclonal antibody (16Todorov P.T. McDevitt T.M. Cariuk P. Coles B. Deacon M. Tisdale M.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1256-1261PubMed Google Scholar) coupled to protein A on an Affi-Gel column. The immunogenic fractions were concentrated and used without further purification. The endotoxin content of the preparation was below the level of detection. Measurement of Protein Degradation—Protein degradation in myotubes was determined as described previously (18Whitehouse A.S. Tisdale M.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 89: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) using 6-well multiwell dishes. Cells were labeled by the addition of 74 kBq of l-[2,6-3H]phenylalanine to each well, and incorporation was maintained for 24 h. The medium was removed and the tubes extensively washed followed by a 2-h preincubation in DMEM without phenol red for 2 h. For the experiment indicated cells were incubated with PIF or Ang II for 24 h in the absence or presence of the PKR inhibitor added 2 h prior to the agents and in the presence of 2 mm “cold” phenylalanine to prevent reincorporation of radioactivity. The extent of protein degradation was determined from the radioactivity released into the medium and was calculated as a fraction of the total radioactivity incorporated into the myotubes. Measurement of Protein Synthesis—Myotubes were formed in 6-well multiwell dishes and were supplemented with DMEM without horse serum and phenol red 18 h prior to experimentation. PIF was added at the concentrations indicated followed by 2 μl (370 kBq) of l-[2,6-3H]phenylalanine (specific activity: 196 TBq/mmol) in 8 μl of sterile phosphate-buffered saline, and the plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 10% CO2 in air. The reaction was arrested by washing three times with 1 ml of ice-cold sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Following removal of phosphate-buffered saline 1 ml of ice-cold 0.2 m perchloric acid was added, and the plates were kept at 4 °C for 20 min. The perchloric acid was substituted with 1 ml of 0.3 m NaOH per well, and incubation was continued for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by a further incubation at 37 °C for 20 min. The NaOH extract was removed and combined with a further 1-ml wash of each well and 0.5 ml of 0.2 m perchloric acid was added and left on ice for 20 min. The extract was then centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the protein-containing pellet was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.3 m NaOH, and 0.5 ml of the solution was counted for radioactivity after mixing with 8 ml of Ultima Gold XR scintillation fluid. To measure the intracellular amino acid pool the perchloric acid extract was neutralized with 0.2 m potassium hydroxide and the insoluble potassium perchlorate removed by centrifugation (4500 × g, 10 min). The radioactivity of the supernatant was determined as above. Measurement of RNA—RNA was estimated in the perchloric acid supernatant in the protein synthesis experiment, by centrifugation of the samples at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and by measuring the absorbance at 232 and 260 nm. The following equation uses the modified formula of Ashford and Pain (19Ashford A.J. Pain V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4059-4065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and corrects for any absorbance due to the presence of aromatic amino acids: RNA (μg/ml) = (A260 × 32.9) – (A232 × 6.11). Measurement of Proteasome Activity—The 20 S proteasome functional activity was determined by measuring the “chymotrypsin-like” enzyme activity, the predominant proteolytic activity of the β-subunits, by the method of Orino et al. (20Orino E. Tanaka K. Tamura T. Sone S. Ogura A. Ichihara A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Activity was determined as described (18Whitehouse A.S. Tisdale M.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 89: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) by the release of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin from the fluorogenic peptide succinyl-LLVY-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. Activity was determined in the absence and presence of the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (10 μm). Only lactacystin-suppressible activity was considered to be proteasome-specific. Activity was normalized to the protein content of the cell extract determined using a standard colorimetric protein assay (Sigma). Western Blot Analysis—Samples of cytosolic protein (5–10 μg) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE (6% for eIF2α) and transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes, which had been blocked with 5% Marvel in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, at 4 °C overnight. The primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1000 except for eIF2α (1:500), actin (1:200), and myosin (1:100), and the secondary antibodies were also used at a dilution of 1:1000. Incubation was for 1 h at room temperature (actin, p42) or overnight, and development was by ECL. Blots were scanned by a densitometer to quantitate differences. EMSA—DNA-binding proteins were extracted from myotubes as described (21Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 192499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar) using hypotonic lysis followed by high salt extraction of nuclei. The EMSA binding assay was carried out using a Panomics EMSA “gel shift” kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assays were conducted using a biotin labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide having a consensus recognition sequence for NF-κB(5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′). Unlabeled probe was added to negative controls, while a positive probe was also supplied by the manufacturer. Protein-DNA complexes were separated using nondenaturing PAGE. Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as mean ± S.E. for at least three replicate experiments. Differences in means between groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. PIF induced a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in protein synthesis in murine myotubes, and the maximum effect was observed after 4 h incubation and at a concentration of 4.2 nm (Fig. 1), as observed previously with murine myoblasts (4Smith H.J. Lorite M.J. Tisdale M.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5507-5513PubMed Google Scholar). The depression of protein synthesis by PIF (30%) was similar to that previously reported for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in soleus muscle (22%; Ref. 22Garcia-Martinez C. Lopez-Soriano F.J. Argiles J.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 125: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and for interleukin-1 (IL-1) in gastrocnemius (30%) and soleus muscles (25%; Ref. 23Cooney R.N. Maish III, G.O. Gilpin T. Shumate M.L. Lang C.H. Vary T.C. Shock. 1999; 11: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The effect of PIF was specific, since it was attenuated by co-incubation with anti-PIF monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml) (Fig. 1). The concentrations of PIF causing significant inhibition of protein synthesis (2.1 to 10.5 nm) were the same as those previously shown to stimulate protein degradation (24Gomes-Marcondes M.C.C. Smith H.J. Cooper J.C. Tisdale M.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 86: 1628-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the dose-response curve showed a similar parabolic relationship. We have previously shown (5Russell S.T. Sanders P.M. Tisdale M.J. Cancer Lett. 2005; 231: 290-294Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that Ang II also inhibits protein synthesis in myotubes at similar concentrations to those inducing protein degradation (6Sanders P.M. Russell S.T. Tisdale M.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2005; 93: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). There was no effect of PIF on the uptake of labeled phenylalanine into myotubes (data not shown), confirming that the effect was on protein synthesis, rather than depletion of the amino acid pool in the cell. There was also no significant effect of PIF on the total cellular RNA, even up to 24 h incubation (data not shown), suggesting that the depression in protein synthesis resulted from an effect on translational efficiency, as reported previously (4Smith H.J. Lorite M.J. Tisdale M.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5507-5513PubMed Google Scholar). Suppression of protein synthesis through phosphorylation of the α-subunit of the translation initiating factor eIF2 is known to occur in response to many forms of cellular stress (25Perkins D.J. Barber D.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2025-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Since PIF can be considered as a stress factor in cancer cachexia, the effect on eIF2α phosphorylation was determined. The results presented in Fig. 1B show that PIF, at the concentration (4.2 nm) producing the maximal depression in protein synthesis in myotubes (Fig. 1A), induced an increase in the phosphorylated form of eIF2α, without an effect on the total eIF2α. Phosphorylation of eIF2α increased with time of exposure, and was significant within 2 h of addition of PIF. Moreover, the does-response curve for the induction of eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 1C) was the same as for the effect on protein synthesis (Fig. 1A). The effect was specific, since it was completely attenuated by co-treatment with anti-PIF monoclonal antibody. Mammalian cells possess at least four different eIF2α kinases (13Proud C.G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Since it is not known which eIF2α kinase is activated in response to PIF a commercially available PKR inhibitor 8-[1-(1H-imidozol-4-yl)meth-(Z)-ylidene]-6,8-dihydrothiazol[5,4-e]indol-7-one (PKRI) (26Jammi N.V. Whitby L.R. Bealm P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) was selected for further study. The data in Fig. 2A show the inhibitor to attenuate the reduction in protein synthesis induced by PIF at concentrations between 100 and 210 nm but not at a concentration of 300 nm. The reason why the higher concentration did not have an effect is not known. Moreover, at a concentration of 210 nm the inhibitor was effective at reversing inhibition of protein synthesis at all concentrations of PIF (Fig. 2B), and this was associated with complete inhibition of the increase in eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). In controls (Figs. 1, 2, 3) there was a mild expression of phosphorylated eIF2α, which possibly arose due to the effects of serum deprivation during the experimental treatments, as previously suggested for cortical neurons under the influence of Aβ peptide (27Sven K.-C.S. Yu M.-S. So K.-F. Chang R.C.-C. Hugon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49819-49827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This is confirmed by treating controls with the PKR inhibitor (Fig. 2D), where levels of phospho-eIF2α were reduced below basal values. The PKR inhibitor was also effective in attenuating the depression in protein synthesis induced by Ang II (Fig. 3A). Ang II also induced an increase in eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 3B), with a similar dose-response curve to the effect on protein synthesis. Phosphorylation of eIF2α by Ang II was also attenuated by the PKR inhibitor (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Effect of inhibition of PKR on protein synthesis in murine myotubes in the presence of Ang II. A, dose response for Ang II in the absence (▪) or presence (□) of the PKR inhibitor (PKRI) (210 nm).

The densitometric analysis represents the average of three separate immunoblots. Differences from control are indicated as a (p < 0.05) or b (p < 0.01), while difference from Ang II alone is shown as d (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results suggest that PKR may be involved in the phosphorylation of eIF2α in response to PIF and Ang II. Upon activation, PKR undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites, although Thr-446 and Thr-451 phosphorylation have been shown to be critical for the kinase activity of human PKR (28Zhang F. Romano P.R. Nagamura-Inoue T. Tian B. Dever T.E. Matthews M.B. Ozato K. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24946-24958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Using an antibody that only detects PKR phosphorylated on Thr-446, Western blotting showed an increase in phosphorylation within 30 min of treating myotubes with PIF (Fig. 4A) or within 2 h of treatment with Ang II (Fig. 4B), which was maintained over the 4-h time course of the experiment. Activation of PKR precedes, but overlaps, the time course for phosphorylation of eIF2α in response to PIF (Fig. 1B). These results confirm activation of PKR in response to PIF and Ang II and suggest that it is responsible for the phosphorylation of eIF2α. Phosphorylation of PKR was also significantly increased in gastrocnemius muscle of weight losing mice bearing a cachexia-inducing tumor, when the weight loss exceeded 16% (Fig. 4C). Activation of PKR was accompanied by a corresponding increase in eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that the same events are occurring in the skeletal muscle of cachectic mice and may be responsible for the depression in protein synthesis. To determine whether PKR is responsible for phosphorylation of eIF2α, and the subsequent depression of protein synthesis by PIF and Ang II, murine myoblasts were transfected with plasmids that express wild-type or catalytically inactive dominant-negative PKR (PKRΔ6) proteins and allowed to differentiate into myotubes. As an additional control myoblasts were also transfected with the non-recombinant empty vector pcDNA3(–). PKRΔ6 has previously been shown to be devoid of kinase activity toward eIF2α (29Balachandran S. Kim C.N. Yeh W.-C. Mak T.W. Bhalla K. Barber G.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6888-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). When incubated with PIF both pcDNA3(–) and wild-type cells showed phosphorylation of PKR (Fig. 5A), while myotubes containing the mutant PKRΔ6 showed no response. The time course for pcDNA3(–) and wild-type PKR transfected cells was the same as with non-transfected cells (Fig. 4A). Myotubes containing PKRΔ6 also showed no phosphorylation of eIF2α in response to PIF (Fig. 5B). In addition, while pcDNA3(–) and wild-type cells showed an equal or greater depression of protein synthesis than non-transfected cells in response to PIF (Fig. 5C) or Ang II (Fig. 5D), there was no effect on PKRΔ6 cells. These results confir"
https://openalex.org/W2151311370,"Activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) by VEGF-C initiates lymphangiogenesis by promoting lymphatic proliferation and migration. However, it is unclear whether VEGFR-3 signaling is required beyond these initial stages, namely during the organization of new lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) into functional capillaries. Furthermore, the role of VEGFR-2, which is also expressed on LECs and binds VEGF-C, is unclear. We addressed these questions by selectively neutralizing VEGFR-3 and/or VEGFR-2 for various time periods in an adult model of lymphangiogenesis in regenerating skin. While blocking either VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3 with specific antagonist mAbs (DC101 and mF4-31C1, respectively) prior to lymphatic migration prevented lymphangiogenesis, blocking VEGFR-3 subsequent to migration did not affect organization into functional capillaries, and VEGFR-2 blocking had only a small hindrance on organization. These findings were confirmed in vitro using human LECs and anti-human antagonist mAbs (IMC-1121a and hF4-3C5): both VEGFR-2 and -3 signaling were required for migration and proliferation, but tubulogenesis in 3D cultures was unaffected by VEGFR-3 blocking and partially hindered by VEGFR-2 blocking. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo, while VEGFR-3 blocking had no effect on LEC organization, coneutralization of VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 completely prevented lymphatic organization. Our findings demonstrate that cooperative signaling of VEGFR-2 and -3 is necessary for lymphatic migration and proliferation, but VEGFR-3 is redundant with VEGFR-2 for LEC organization into functional capillaries."
https://openalex.org/W2106521718,"Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is an extracellular glycoprotein expressed in several solid cancers, including malignant gliomas, upon adoption of metastatic or invasive behaviors. SPARC expression in glioma cells promotes invasion and survival under stress, the latter process dependent on SPARC activation of AKT. Here we demonstrate that downregulation of SPARC expression with short interfering RNA (siRNA) in glioma cells decreased tumor cell survival and invasion. SPARC siRNA reduced the activating phosphorylation of AKT and two cytoplasmic kinases, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and integrin-linked kinase (ILK). We determined the contributions of FAK and ILK to SPARC effects using SPARC protein and cell lines engineered to overexpress SPARC. SPARC activated FAK and ILK in glioma cells previously characterized as responsive to SPARC. Downregulation of either FAK or ILK expression inhibited SPARC-mediated AKT phosphorylation, and targeting both FAK and ILK attenuated AKT activation more potently than targeting either FAK or ILK alone. Decreased SPARC-mediated AKT activation correlated with a reduction in SPARC-dependent invasion and survival upon the downregulation of FAK and/or ILK expression. These data further demonstrate the role of SPARC in glioma tumor progression through the activation of intracellular kinases that may provide novel therapeutic targets for advanced cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2139286759,"Members of the ferric/zinc uptake regulator (Fur/Zur) family are the central metal-dependent regulator proteins in many Gram-negative and -positive bacteria. They are responsible for the control of a wide variety of basic physiological processes and the expression of important virulence factors in human pathogens. Therefore, Fur has gathered significant interest as a potential target for novel antibiotics. Here we report the crystal structure of FurB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis at a resolution of 2.7Å, and we present biochemical and spectroscopic data that allow us to propose the functional role of this protein. Although the overall fold of FurB with an N-terminal DNA binding domain and a C-terminal dimerization domain is conserved among the Zur/Fur family, large differences in the spatial arrangement of the two domains with respect to each other can be observed. The biochemical and spectroscopic analysis presented here reveals that M. tuberculosis FurB is Zn(II)-dependent and is likely to control genes involved in the bacterial zinc uptake.

The combination of the structural, spectroscopic, and biochemical results enables us to determine the structural basis for functional differences in this important family of bacterial regulators. Iron, zinc, and other transition metals are essential elements for almost all living organisms as they play important roles in a wide range of cellular processes (1Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar, 2Hantke K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). They act either as structural components or as obligate co-factors in various functions ranging from respiration to DNA replication. A balanced efflux/influx of these metal ions has to be achieved to satisfy the requirements of the cell and to avoid toxicity. Bacteria have therefore developed highly sophisticated systems to reach homeostasis based on storage, export, and uptake of metals (3Braun V. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 291: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 4Finney L.A. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2003; 300: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 5Nelson N.

Furthermore, the regulation of gene expression as a response to changing conditions in the environment is one of the key elements in survival of any bacterial pathogen in the host.

Once the protein is bound to its target DNA, it blocks access of the RNA polymerase, thereby repressing the downstream genes. Their homodimeric nature allows DNA interaction mainly with palindromic or pseudo-palindromic regions, where a helix-turn-helix protein domain is located in the major groove of the oligonucleotide (13Huffman J.L. Brennan R.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Fur and zinc uptake regulator (Zur) belong to the same family showing overall sequence similarities but evidently dissimilar biological functions (10Hantke K. Biometals. 2001; 14: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Fur has been characterized as a generic iron-responsive regulator. In many bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, members of this family are also involved in the control of a variety of metabolisms as follows: iron uptake and storage, defenses against oxidative and acid stress, as well as the regulation of a number of genes responsible for virulence, including hemolysin, shiga-like toxin, and exotoxin A (14Litwin C.M. Calderwood S.B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 6: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 15Vasil M.L. Ochsner U.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Fur has also been shown to control two small regulatory RNAs (rhyA and rhyB), which in turn regulate the expression of further genes involved in iron metabolism (16Masse E. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4620-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 17Wilderman P.J. Sowa N.A. FitzGerald D.J. FitzGerald P.C. Gottesman S. Ochsner U.A. Vasil M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9792-9797Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Thus, Fur can indirectly act as an activator by repressing these small RNAs. On the other hand, Zur is a zinc uptake regulator and acts exclusively as a repressor (10Hantke K. Biometals. 2001; 14: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Gaballa A. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5815-5821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the last few years, a number of genes responsible for Zn(II) uptake have been characterized in E. coli. In particular, the znuABC operon, encoding for a specific triplet of proteins, ZnuA (periplasmic protein), ZnuB (membrane protein), and ZnuC (ATPase), has been shown to be regulated by Zur. When the level of the metal in the media reaches a critical point, Zur repression of the znu gene cluster is lifted, allowing the expression of the proteins involved in the ion influx (18Gaballa A. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5815-5821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Patzer S.I. Hantke K. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4806-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Today Mycobacterium tuberculosis continues to be one of the major killers of the century: every year more than eight million people contract tuberculosis and about 2.5 million patients die (21Zignol M. Hosseini M.S. Wright A. Weezenbeek C.L. Nunn P. Watt C.J. Williams B.G. Dye C. J. Infect. Dis. 2006; 194: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 22Kaufmann S.H. Immunity. 2006; 24: 351-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In 1998, when the M. tuberculosis genome was sequenced, many proteins were assigned by sequence homology to previously existing and well characterized families from other organisms (23Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry C.E. II I Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K.

Squares R. Squares S. Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6522) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the genome contained homologues of both major families of iron-responsive repressor proteins but no zinc uptake regulator. Although the global iron-dependent regulator IdeR from M. tuberculosis (member of the Diphtheria toxin Repressor family) has been structurally and biochemically well characterized (24Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Rodriguez G.M. Smith I. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1485-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 26Wisedchaisri G. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1155-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), far less is known about the two Fur genes that were identified. FurA has been shown to regulate the catalase-peroxidase KatG and is therefore directly involved in isoniazid resistance and virulence (27Pym A.S. Domenech P. Honore N. Song J. Deretic V. Cole S.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). FurB on the other hand has been shown to be inducible by zinc, but its exact biological role has not yet been clarified (28Canneva F. Branzoni M. Riccardi G. Provvedi R. Milano A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5837-5840Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To elucidate the biological function and mechanism of M. tuberculosis FurB, we present results from a wide range of biochemical and biophysical methods indicating that this protein is the zinc uptake regulator. Furthermore, in this work we present the crystal structure of FurB in complex with Zn2+ at a resolution of 2.7 Å. For the first time these results allow the determination of the activation mechanism and provide the structural basis of metal specificity in the Fur/Zur family. Protein Expression and Purification—The furB gene from the M. tuberculosis genome H37Rv was cloned into pETM11 vector using HindIII (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) and XhoI (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) restriction sites and expressed in E. coli BL21* by overnight induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Fermentas) at 20 °C. Because of the introduced tobacco etch virus cleavage site, there is one additional alanine residue inserted at position 2 compared with the original sequence. The protein was purified through nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Qiagen) followed by cleavage of the His6 tag with tobacco etch virus protease and size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences). Dynamic light scattering and mass spectroscopy were performed to confirm the purity of the sample. The concentration was monitored using either a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) or by measuring the absorption at 280 nm in 6.0 m guanidinium chloride and 0.02 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and using the calculated absorption coefficient (obtained on line from the “Expasy protein chart”). Sequence Analyses—At present E. coli Zur is the best characterized zinc uptake regulator. The protein regulates the znu gene cluster encoding for the zinc import system ZnuABC. Sequence searches against the M. tuberculosis genome were executed with either BLAST (29Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar) or FASTA (30Lipman D.J. Pearson W.R. Science. 1985; 227: 1435-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar). DNA Binding Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using canonical Fur-box and a 27-bp almost palindromic DNA sequence identical to the promoter region of Rv2059. The duplex oligonucleotides were mixed with the protein in the presence or absence of different metals in a low salt buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). The solution was then loaded on a 4–20% native gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under a UV lamp. Micro-PIXE Sample Preparation—Two samples (the protein as isolated and previously treated with chelating agents) were left for overnight dialysis in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaBr, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm ascorbate. The buffer exchange is necessary to remove any traces of sulfur and chlorine. For micro-PIXE measurements of proteins sulfur acts as an internal standard, and because of the proximity of the x-ray emission energies of sulfur and chlorine, strong chloride fluorescence can affect the accuracy with which the sulfur peak can be quantified (31Garman E.F. Grime G.W. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2005; 89: 173-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The measurements were carried out at the National Ion Beam Centre, University of Surrey, UK (32Grime G.W. Dawson M. Marsh M. McArthur I.C. Watt F. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. B. 1991; 54: 52-63Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A 2.5-MeV proton beam of 2 μm in diameter was used to induce characteristic x-ray emission from the dried liquid droplet (volume 0.1 μl) under vacuum. The x-rays were detected in a solid state lithium-drifted silicon detector with high energy resolution. By scanning the proton beam in x and y over the droplet, spatial maps were obtained of all elements heavier than neon present in the sample. Quantitative information was obtained by collecting 3 or 4 point spectra from the sample area. These spectra were analyzed with GUPIX within DAN32 to extract the relative amount of each element of interest in the sample (31Garman E.F. Grime G.W. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2005; 89: 173-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Crystal Structure Determination—Crystals were obtained by hanging-drop vapor diffusion by mixing the protein at a concentration of 13 mg/ml with the reservoir solution containing 14% glycerol and 0.3 m (NH4)2HPO4. Microcrystals with a maximum dimension of 20 μm were initially tested using the microfocus beam line X06SA at the Swiss Light Source. Most of these crystals did not show any diffraction; however, very few crystals diffracted up to 3.5 Å resolution. Further optimization of purification and crystallization resulted in larger crystals (∼120 × 40 × 40 μm), which in favorable cases diffracted to better than 3 Å resolution Tetragonal crystals with a = b = 51.6, c = 133.4 Å, space group P41212 were mounted directly from the mother liquor and flash-cooled in a cold nitrogen stream (100 K). Multiple anomalous diffraction data across the Zn edge were collected at 100 K at beamline X06SA (Swiss Light Source) using a MarCCD 225 detector. Diffraction data were processed with XDS (33Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 797-800Crossref Scopus (3233) Google Scholar). Three zinc sites per monomer were located using SHELXD (34Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Phases from these sites were calculated, extended to 2.7 Å, and refined by solvent flattening as implemented in SHELXE (35Sheldrick G.M. Z. Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The resulting electron density was readily interpretable (see Figs. 3, 4, 5). The refinement against the 2.7 Å native data set collected with a second crystal was completed by iterative cycles of model building with O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) and crystallographic refinement using torsion angle molecular dynamics with CNS (37Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The final crystallographic model refined with REFMAC (38Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) includes residues 2–130, 3 zinc ions, and 8 solvent molecules. The metal sites were refined with target values for the distances, and the van der Waals' electrostatic terms were switched off. The side chains of some polar residues are invisible in the electron density map and were thus refined as alanines. All residues are in the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Further details of the crystal structure determination are summarized in Table 2.

The second sample was treated with a chelating agent (EDTA) and then dialyzed against the same metal-free buffer. Both samples were transferred into a plastic cuvette (Hesar Glas) with Kapton® windows, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at 20 K in a helium close-cycle cryostat (Oxford Instruments) during the experiment. X-ray absorption data at the cobalt and zinc edges were recorded in fluorescence mode at the EMBL beam line D2 (DESY) equipped with a Si(111) double crystal monochromator, a focusing mirror, and a 13-element germanium solid state fluorescence detector (39Pettifer R.F. Hermes C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1985; 18: 404-412Crossref Google Scholar). Harmonic rejection was achieved by a focusing mirror with a cut-off energy of 21 keV and a monochromator detuning to 70 and 50% of the peak intensity at the zinc and cobalt absorption edges, respectively. Data reduction analysis of about 50 scans was performed with the software program KEMP (40Korbas M. Marsa D.F. Meyer-Klaucke W. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 2006; 77: 063105Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using E0 = 9660 eV for the zinc edge and E0 = 7714 eV for the cobalt edge. The EXAFS spectra were analyzed with EXCURV98 (41Binsted N. Strange R.W. Hasnain S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12117-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The quality of the fit was assessed quantitatively using the R value (REXAFS) as shown in Equation 1, REXAFS=NΣi(|χiexp(k)-χith(k)|)×100&percnt;(Eq. 1) For each model the inter-atomic distances and the Debye-Waller factors were refined by least square techniques. In the case of the cobalt-EXAFS refinement, the Debye-Waller for the light atoms was refined jointly to reduce the number of free parameters. The results are summarized in Table 3.TABLE 3Summary of the EXAFS refinements of the best models R indicates inter-atomic distance; 2σ2 indicates Debye-Waller factor; EF indicates Fermi energy, the shift of the energy origin with respect to E0,Zn = 9660 eV and E0,Co = 7714 eV, respectively.

Micro-PIXE analysis was performed to determine the type and the number of metal ions in the protein. The analysis shows that M. tuberculosis FurB as isolated after the purification as well as after overnight treatment with EDTA contained approximately 1 zinc atom per monomer (Table 1). Surprisingly, it was not possible to complex the protein with Fe2+, the natural cofactor of all ferric uptake regulators.TABLE 1Micro-PIXE analysis of FurB in solution as isolated and treated with EDTA In each cell the number of metal ions per monomer is reported.SampleZn2+Fe2+Cu2+FurB0.81 (0.16)aThe relatively large errors quoted are due to low counting statistics.

As shown in Fig. 1 the protein does not bind the canonical Fur-box. Taking into account the strong Zn binding, we identified possible DNA targets by locating a gene cluster in the M. tuberculosis genome that shows similarity to the Zur-regulated znuABC operon in E. coli. In the M. tuberculosis genome a triplet of genes, Rv2059 (2,315,172–2,316,707), Rv2060 (2,316,277–2316678), Rv2061c (2,316,679–2,317,083), coding for a hypothetical adhesion protein, a possible conserved integral membrane protein, and a phosphatase, was found that shows high sequence similarity with the E. coli znuABC operon. In the promoter region of this operon an almost perfectly palindromic 27-bp sequence was identified and consequently used for the gel shifts (Fig. 1b). The assays showed that M. tuberculosis FurB binds exclusively to this operator sequence and in addition that only Zn2+ can activate the regulator (Fig. 1b). M. tuberculosis FurB appears to be more selective than the Fur homologues from other organisms, which can be activated in vitro by a variety of divalent transition metals (42Mills S.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13553-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Structure of M. tuberculosis FurB—The crystal structure of FurB was determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) at the Zn edge to a minimum Bragg spacing of 2.7 Å and refined to an R value of 0.230 (Rfree = 0.239) with good geometry (Table 2). The molecule is located on a crystallographic 2-fold axis that generates the functional dimer. The basic fold of the monomer shown in Fig. 2 consists of two domains as follows: the N-terminal DNA binding domain (residues 1–77) and the C-terminal dimerization domain (residues 78–131). The DNA binding domain is composed of three α-helices followed by a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. This domain exhibits the typical winged helix motif with a three-helices bundle (H1, H2, and H3), where the helix H3 is the putative DNA recognition region (residues 34–54) (13Huffman J.L. Brennan R.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The dimerization domain is constituted of three antiparallel β-strands (S3, S4, and S5) and one long α-helix (H4) stabilized by one of the metal-binding sites. The β-strands S3–S5 form a six-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet with its symmetry mates S5′–S3′. In addition, there are a number of hydrophilic and hydrophobic contacts from helix H4 to the symmetry-related H4′. This arrangement results in a tight dimer interface with a buried surface of ∼1400 Å2 per monomer. Metal-binding Sites of M. tuberculosis FurB in the Crystal— The crystal structure of FurB possesses three distinct zinc sites (Zn1–Zn3). Two of the metal ions are in the dimerization domain, and one is located in the hinge region between the dimerization and the DNA binding domain. Each of the metal sites exhibits different structural and chemical environments depending on its functional role. Site 1 is surrounded by Asp-62, Cys-76, His-81, and His-83 (Fig. 3). This site occupies a strategic position in the protein structure because it is coordinated by two amino acids from the DNA binding domain (Asp-62 and Cys-76) and two from the dimerization domain (His-81 and His-83). Site 2 is tetrahedrally coordinated to a cluster of sulfur ligands as follows: Cys-86 and Cys-89 from the dimerization domain and Cys-126 and Cys-129 located at the C terminus (Fig. 4). This tetrahedral geometry has already been observed in many other zinc proteins, and the geometrical parameters agree with those previously reported in the literature (43Auld D.S. Biometals. 2001; 14: 271-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Site 3 is located in the core of the dimerization domain. Here, the Zn2+ ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by three histidines (His-80, His-82, and His-118) and one glutamate (Glu-101) (Fig. 5). This metal site links the β-sheet of the dimerization domain with the C-terminal α-helix. Because of an initially high B-factor, this zinc site was refined with an occupancy of 0.5. EXAFS Results of M. tuberculosis FurB—The initial EXAFS experiments in which the protein sample was first dialyzed against an Fe(II)-containing solution and afterward dialyzed against metal-free buffer did not show any significant iron fluorescence.

These results suggest that ASK2 forms a functional MAP3K complex with ASK1, in which ASK1 supports the stability and the active configuration of ASK2. Moreover, ASK2 was found to activate ASK1 by direct phosphorylation, suggesting that ASK1 and ASK2 in a heteromeric complex facilitate their activities to each other by distinct mechanisms.

Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). Three main MAPK cascades that converge on extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 MAPKs have been well characterized. Each MAPK cascade consists of three classes of serine/threonine kinases, MAPK, MAPK kinase (MAP2K), and MAP2K kinase (MAP3K). MAP3K phosphorylates and thereby activates MAP2K, and activated MAP2K in turn phosphorylates and activates MAPK. A growing number of MAP3Ks have been identified, each of which activates single or multiple downstream MAPK cascades. Extensive characterization of several MAP3Ks has demonstrated that MAP3Ks are crucial to sense extracellular and intracellular stimuli and regulate cellular responses through the activation of downstream MAPK pathways (3Ichijo H.

ASK1 regulates the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways by directly phosphorylating and thereby activating their respective MAP2Ks, MKK4 (SEK1)/MKK7 and MKK3/MKK6 (9Wang X.S. Diener K. Jannuzzi D. Trollinger D.

Recent analyses of ASK1-deficient mice have revealed that ASK1 is required for apoptosis induced by oxidative stress, tumor necrosis factor, and endoplasmic reticulum stress and plays essential roles in innate immune responses (12Nishitoh H.

In the present study, we showed that ASK2, a highly related kinase to ASK1, stably formed a heteromeric complex with ASK1 in mammalian cells. ASK2 was identical to MAPKKK6, which was previously reported to be a MAP3K that only weakly activated JNK but not ERK or p38 (19Wang X.S. Diener K. Tan T.H. Yao Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, we failed to detect apparent kinase activity of single transfection of ASK2 plasmid. Instead, we found that the effective protein expression and the kinase activity of ASK2 were facilitated by the heteromeric complex formation with ASK1. ASK2 in a complex with ASK1 was competent to respond to oxidative stress and functions as a MAP3K of the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways. Cell Culture—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild type or ASK1-deficient mice (18Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4.5 mg/ml glucose, and 100 units/ml penicillin G in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Mouse B16 melanoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin Gin a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. A crude population of bone marrow-derived macrophages was generated in vitro from bone marrow of wild type or ASK1-deficient mice as described with some modification (26Akagawa K.S. Takasuka N. Nozaki Y. Komuro I. Azuma M. Ueda M. Naito M. Takahashi K. Blood. 1996; 88: 4029-4039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bone marrow cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 10 ng/ml of recombinant mouse granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (Strathmann Biotech), and 5 ng/ml of recombinant mouse interleukin-4 (Genzyme-Techne). The medium was replaced on day 2 and 4, and the nonadherent granulocytes and loosely adherent dendritic cells were rinsed away. On day 7 of culture, the firmly adherent cells were obtained and subjected to further analysis. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibody to ASK2 was established as described (27Sakagami H. Aoki J. Natori Y. Nishikawa K. Kakehi Y. Natori Y. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23084-23093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, a GST-tagged C-terminal fragment of mouse ASK2 corresponding to amino acids 1,078-1,292 was produced and purified from Escherichia coli strain BL21. WYK/Izm rats were immunized via the hind footpads with the recombinant protein using Freund's complete adjuvant. The enlarged medial iliac lymph nodes from the rats were used for cell fusion with mouse myeloma cells, SP2, and the hybridoma cells were cultured in GIT medium (Wako Pure Chemicals) supplemented with 100 μm hypoxanthine, 0.4 μm aminopterin, 16 μm thymidine, 10% FBS, and 2% BM Condimed H1 (Roche Applied Science). The antibody-secreting hybridoma was selected by screening with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting. Because of the low growth rate of the cloned hybridoma cells, the mixture of culture medium from several positive clones was used in this study. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to ASK1 and phospho-ASK1 were described previously (11Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar, 20Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Cell Physiol. 2002; 191: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to ASK1 (Santa Cruz; H-300) was used in RNA interference experiments. Rat monoclonal antibody to the hemagglutinin (HA) tag (clone 3F10) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to FLAG (M2) and Myc (9E10) tags were purchased from Sigma and Calbiochem, respectively. Phospho-specific antibodies to JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) and p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) MAPK were purchased from Cell Signaling. p38 goat polyclonal antibody (C-20-G) and JNK rabbit polyclonal antibody (JNK1-FL) were purchased from Santa Cruz. Rat α-tubulin (YL1/2) and mouse GFP (1E4) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Serotec and MBL, respectively. The proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and lactacystin, were purchased from Calbiochem. Yeast Two-hybrid System—A human fibroblast WI-38 cDNA library in the prey plasmid pJG4-5 was screened for proteins that interact with ASK1-ΔN, which lacked the N-terminal 648 amino acids, using EGY48 yeast strain containing the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid pSH18-34 as described previously (11Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). The bait plasmid expressing ASK1 protein was constructed in-frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain of pEG202. Plasmids of positive clones were recovered, and the cDNA inserts were sequenced. To assay the interaction between ASK1 and ASK2, the full-length mouse ASK2 cDNA was inserted in pJG4-5. Because of the intrinsic prey-independent transcriptional activity of LexA DNA-binding domain-wild type ASK1 fusion protein, the cDNA for a full-length but kinase-negative mutant of ASK1 (ASK1-KN) was inserted in pEG202. ASK1 and ASK2 constructs were co-transformed along with the reporter plasmid pSH18-34 in EGY48 yeast strains. Isolation of Full-length cDNAs for Human and Mouse ASK2—To clone mouse ASK2 cDNA, mouse kidney and lung cDNA libraries were screened with a partial human ASK2 cDNA fragment obtained by the two-hybrid screening as a probe, and positive clones were purified and sequenced as described previously (28Tobiume K. Inage T. Takeda K. Enomoto S. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To obtain a 5′ cDNA fragment of mouse ASK2, rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends was performed using a cDNA pool from mouse fibroblast L929 cells and a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To clone human ASK2 cDNA, we designed several pairs of PCR primer based on the information including the cDNA sequences obtained by the two-hybrid screening, the deposited sequence of human MAPKKK6 (19Wang X.S. Diener K. Tan T.H. Yao Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number AF100318 that lacks the N-terminal sequence), the expressed sequence tag sequences encoding the N-terminal sequence (AI582755 and BF732392), and the human MAP3K6 genomic sequence. By using these primers and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), we cloned the full-length cDNA for human ASK2 by reverse transcription-PCR from total RNA isolated from HEK293 cells. The following oligonucleotides were used for the isolation of cDNAs for human and mouse ASK2: hS1, 5′-TCCAGATCCCAAGATTCCTGATCTGCCGG-3′; hS2, 5′-TCCAGAAGAACTCGGATTGCGTTGG-3′; hAS1, 5′-ATAGGGGATCAGTGTGTAGCTGCCAACGC-3′; hAS2, 5′-GGTTGTCGTGCAAGTAGCCAAGTCC-3′; mAS1, 5′-TTGATGTGGAGCCCAGCCTGCAC-3′; and mAS2, 5′-GATACGACCACACATGCAGTACAG-3′. Expression Plasmids and Adenovirus Vectors—Epitope-tagged mammalian expression plasmids for ASK1 were described previously (11Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M.

Cell Physiol. 2002; 191: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Kinase-negative mutants of ASK1 (ASK1-KN) in this study were constructed by replacing a lysine residue located in subdomain II of the kinase domain by arginine (K709R) or methionine (K709M). cDNAs for mouse ASK2 and its kinase-negative mutant, in which a lysine residue located in subdomain II of the kinase domain by methionine (K678M), were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with N-terminal ECFP (Clontech), FLAG, or HA tags. Transfection of these expression plasmids into HEK293 cells and MEFs was performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For bacterial expression, ASK2 and ASK1 cDNAs were subcloned into pGEX-4T (GE Healthcare) with an N-terminal GST tag and pCDF-1b (Novagen) with a hexahistidine (His) tag, respectively. E. coli strain BL21 was transformed with these bacterial expression plasmids and selected on LB plates containing 50 μg/ml of ampicillin and 10 μg/ml of streptomycin. Recombinant adenoviruses encoding ASK1 and β-galactosidase were described previously (11Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—For the co-immunoprecipitation between transiently expressed proteins in HEK293 cells, the cells were lysed with the IP lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). The cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody gel (M2 gel, Sigma). The beads were washed three times with the IP lysis buffer before analysis by SDS-PAGE. For the endogenous interaction between ASK1 and ASK2, MEFs were lysed in the IP lysis buffer. The supernatants obtained by centrifugation of the cell extracts were incubated with either ASK1 rabbit polyclonal antibody or control normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz) for overnight at 4 °C. After the 1-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), the beads were washed three times with the IP lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting Analysis—Cell extracts and immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), the membranes were probed with antibodies. The antibody·antigen complexes were detected using the ECL system (GE Healthcare). Quantitative PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from MEFs using Isogen (Wako) and reverse transcribed with Super-Script II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Primers were designed using Primer Express 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems). The following oligonucleotides were used: ASK1 sense, 5′-CCCTGGAGACCCTGCATTT-3′; ASK1 antisense, 5′-CATCTCCACCACAGCAATATCTG-3′; ASK2 sense, 5′-TGGCACAGCCTTCCTTGTTC-3′; ASK2 antisense, 5′-CACAATCCGAGTTCTTCTGGAAA-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sense, 5′-TGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antisense, 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGA-3′. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was carried out by ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). A standard curve of critical threshold versus log concentration for each transcript was generated by serial dilutions of cDNA pool from wild type (WT) MEFs. Each transcript level in WT and ASK1-deficiend MEFs was calculated using ABI PRISM 7000 SDS software, and the relative mRNA expression of ASK1 or ASK2 in WT versus ASK1 deficient MEFs was determined by normalization to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression. In Vitro Kinase Assay—GST-MKK6 and GST-p38-KN, were prepared as described previously (11Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). FLAG-ASK1 or -ASK2 was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells as described under “Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis.” The immune complex was incubated in a kinase buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm ATP together with GST-MKK6 for 10 min at room temperature. The kinase reaction was then added with GST-p38-KN and incubated for further 10 min at room temperature. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using phospho-p38 antibody. Measurement of Caspase-3-like Activity—Caspase-3-like activity in cell extracts was measured by a CPP32/caspase-3 fluorometric protease assay kit (MBL) following the manufacturer's instructions, in which a fluorogenic synthetic peptide DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin was used as a substrate. The fluorescence of the released 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin was measured with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm using Twinkle LB970 (Berthold). RNA Interference—Small interference RNAs (siRNAs) for mouse ASK1 and ASK2 were purchased from Invitrogen (Stealth Select RNAi, MSS218536 and MSS225396, respectively). Stealth RNAi Negative CTL (Invitrogen) was used as a control. B16 cells that were seeded in 12-well plates were transfected with 40 pmol/well of siRNA using 2 μl/well of Lipo-fectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). After 30 h, the cells were treated or untreated with 0.5 mm H2O2 for 30 min and were subjected to immunoblotting analysis. Identification of ASK2 as an ASK1-binding Protein—To identify molecules that interact with ASK1, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system using a deletion mutant of ASK1 (ASK1-ΔN) that lacked N-terminal 648 amino acids as a bait. In a screen of human fibroblast WI-38 cDNA library, we identified a positive clone that encodes a putative serine/threonine kinase. Subsequent cloning of corresponding human and mouse full-length cDNAs revealed that this kinase was closely related to ASK1 and therefore was designated as ASK2 (also called MAP-KKK6 (19Wang X.S. Diener K. Tan T.H. Yao Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1, A and B). Human and mouse ASK2 consist of 1,288 and 1,291 amino acids, respectively, and each possessed a kinase domain in the middle part of the molecule with long N- and C-terminal flanking regions. Overall structure of ASK2 was well conserved with that of ASK1 (Fig. 1A). The interaction of ASK1 with the cloned full-length version of mouse ASK2 was confirmed by the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1C). We also detected the interaction between Myc-tagged ASK1 (Myc-ASK1) and FLAG-tagged ASK2 (FLAG-ASK2) by co-immunoprecipitation analysis in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1D). To examine the endogenous interaction of ASK1 and ASK2, we established an antibody that specifically recognizes ASK2. The ASK2 antibody selectively recognized ASK2 but not ASK1 that were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1E). Cell lysates from MEFs were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the ASK1 antibody, and endogenous ASK2 co-purified with ASK1 was clearly detected by immunoblotting with the ASK2 antibody (Fig. 1F). This result suggested that ASK2 forms a heteromeric complex with ASK1 in unstimulated cells. ASK1 Stabilizes ASK2—By using the ASK2 antibody, we noticed by chance that expression of ASK2 was strongly reduced in ASK1-deficient cells including MEFs and bone marrow-derived macrophages (Fig. 2A). Expression of ASK2 mRNA was not decreased (even increased) in ASK1-deficient (-/-) MEFs as compared with wild type (+/+) cells (Fig. 2B), suggesting that reduction of synthesis or augmentation of degradation of ASK2 proteins may occur in ASK1-deficient cells. When we treated ASK1-deficient MEFs with either Lactacystin or MG132 (both are the proteasome inhibitors), an expression of endogenous ASK2 comparable with that in wild type MEFs was observed (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, the treatment of wild type MEFs with these reagents had little effect on the expression of ASK2. These results suggested that ASK2 is constitutively degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the absence of ASK1. To confirm that degradation of ASK2 in ASK1-deficient cells was caused by the deficiency of ASK1, we reintroduced ASK1 into ASK1-deficient MEFs using adenovirus vectors and examined the expression of endogenous ASK2. As shown in Fig. 2D (middle panels), endogenous ASK2 expression in ASK1-deficient cells (-/-) was rescued by the exogenous ASK1 expressed using relatively low doses (multiplicity of infection of 5-20) of adenovirus encoding HA-ASK1 (Ad-HA-ASK1) in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, ASK2 expression was not increased by the expression of exogenous ASK1 in wild type (+/+) cells (Fig. 2D, left panels), precluding the possibility that ASK2 antibody crossreacted with exogenously expressed ASK1 in ASK1-deficient cells. This result also suggested that the amount of endogenous ASK1 is sufficient for the maximal expression of endogenous ASK2 in wild type MEFs. Consistently, endogenous ASK2 expression was saturated by the expression of much larger amounts of ASK1 accomplished by the infection with higher doses (multiplicity of infection of 50-200) of Ad-HA-ASK1 in ASK1-deficient cells (Fig. 2D, right panels). These results clearly demonstrated that degradation of endogenous ASK2 was prevented in the presence of ASK1. Interestingly, exogenous expression of a kinase-negative mutant of ASK1 (ASK1-KN) instead of wild type ASK1 sufficiently suppressed the ASK2 degradation (Fig. 2E), indicating that ASK1-dependent stabilization of ASK2 does not require the kinase activity of ASK1. C-terminal Region of ASK1 Binds to ASK2 and Inhibits the Degradation of ASK2—The above data showing the kinase-independent activity of ASK1 to suppress ASK2 degradation suggested that ASK2 stability is simply supported by the physical interaction with ASK1. Because the coiled-coil domain in the C-terminal region of ASK1 (ASK1-CT) has been shown to be required for homo-oligomerization of ASK1 (20Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Cell Physiol. 2002; 191: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 21Noguchi T. Takeda K. Matsuzawa A. Saegusa K. Nakano H. Gohda J. Inoue J.I. Ichijo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37033-37040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we examined whether ASK1-CT is also required for the association of ASK1 with ASK2 by using HA-tagged deletion mutants of ASK1 as shown in Fig. 3A. HA-ASK1-CT but not HA-ASK1-ΔC was found to be co-precipitated with FLAG-ASK2, indicating that ASK1-CT was necessary and sufficient for the binding of ASK1 to ASK2 (Fig. 3B). We therefore examined whether ASK1-CT is also involved in the suppression of ASK2 degradation. Transfection of plasmids encoding ASK1-ΔC into ASK1-deficient MEFs failed to rescue the expression of ASK2 (Fig. 3C), suggesting that ASK1-CT is necessary not only for the association with ASK2 but also for the suppression of ASK2 degradation. Expression of ASK1-CT in ASK1-deficient MEFs rescued endogenous ASK2 expression in a manner dependent on the expression levels of ASK1-CT (Fig. 3C), although ASK1-CT was less effective to suppress ASK2 degradation than ASK1-WT, possibly because of the insufficient conformation of ASK1-CT for a full rescue of ASK2 expression. These results suggested that ASK1, mainly through its C-terminal region, binds to ASK2 and support the effective protein expression of ASK2 by preventing its constitutive degradation. Co-expression with ASK1 Confers Basal Kinase Activity to ASK2—We next sought to determine the activation state of ASK2 when it is stabilized in a heteromeric complex with ASK1. We have previously found that activation of ASK1 is tightly regulated by the phosphorylation of a threonine residue within the activation loop of ASK1 (Thr838 and Thr845 of human and mouse ASK1, respectively) and that the phospho-specific antibody, which recognizes the phosphorylation of this threonine residue, monitors the activation state of ASK1 (20Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Cell Physiol. 2002; 191: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Comparison of amino acid sequences between ASK1 and ASK2 revealed that all amino acids but one in the activation loops of ASK1 and ASK2 were identical (Fig. 4A). This close similarity of the primary structure between the two kinases suggested that the kinase activity of ASK2 is also regulated by phosphorylation of the corresponding threonine residue in ASK2 to Thr838 in human ASK1 (Thr806 and Thr807 of human and mouse ASK2, respectively). We first examined the phosphorylation state of ASK2 in bacterial cells to negate the constitutive degradation of ASK2 when it was singly expressed in mammalian cells (Fig. 4B). GST-tagged ASK2 (GST-ASK2) co-expressed with hexahistidine-tagged kinase-negative ASK1 (His-ASK1-KN), but not singly expressed GST-ASK2, was recognized by the phospho-ASK antibody, indicating that the phosphorylation at Thr807 of ASK2 was induced by the presence of ASK1 (Fig. 4B, first and second lanes). On the other hand, a kinase-negative mutant of ASK2 (ASK2-KN) was not reactive to the antibody even when it was co-expressed with ASK1-KN (Fig. 4B, third and fourth lanes). These results sugge"
https://openalex.org/W2094589918,"Recent studies suggest that the second extracellular loop (o2 loop) of bovine rhodopsin and other class I G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) targeted by biogenic amine ligands folds deeply into the transmembrane receptor core where the binding of cis-retinal and biogenic amine ligands is known to occur. In the past, the potential role of the o2 loop in agonist-dependent activation of biogenic amine GPCRs has not been studied systematically. To address this issue, we used the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3R), a prototypic class I GPCR, as a model system. Specifically, we subjected the o2 loop of the M3R to random mutagenesis and subsequently applied a novel yeast genetic screen to identity single amino acid substitutions that interfered with M3R function. This screen led to the recovery of about 20 mutant M3Rs containing single amino acid changes in the o2 loop that were inactive in yeast. In contrast, application of the same strategy to the extracellular N-terminal domain of the M3R did not yield any single point mutations that disrupted M3R function. Pharmacological characterization of many of the recovered mutant M3Rs in mammalian cells, complemented by site-directed mutagenesis studies, indicated that the presence of several o2 loop residues is important for efficient agonist-induced M3R activation. Besides the highly conserved Cys220 residue, Gln207, Gly211, Arg213, Gly218, Ile222, Phe224, Leu225, and Pro228 were found to be of particular functional importance. In general, mutational modification of these residues had little effect on agonist binding affinities. Our findings are therefore consistent with a model in which multiple o2 loop residues are involved in stabilizing the active state of the M3R. Given the high degree of structural homology found among all biogenic amine GPCRs, our findings should be of considerable general relevance.

GPCR-mediated signaling pathways regulate the activity of an extraordinarily large number of physiological functions. GPCRs are activated by the binding of different structural classes of extracellular ligands, including neurotransmitters, hormones, and sensory stimuli (1Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 2Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 3Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J.

All GPCRs are predicted to share a common molecular structure consisting of seven transmembrane helical domains (TM I–VII) connected by three intracellular and three extracellular loops (1Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 2Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 3Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarity, the mammalian GPCRs can be subclassified into several major subfamilies (1Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 2Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 3Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J.

Family I represents by far the largest subgroup of GPCRs, consisting of about 700 different members in human (4Fredriksson R. Lagerström M.C. Lundin L.-G. Schiöth H.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1256-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar). Because the members of this receptor family share considerable sequence homology with rhodopsin, the class I GPCRs are also referred to as rhodopsin-like GPCRs. Most small ligands acting on class I GPCRs, including rhodopsin and the classic biogenic amine ligands such as acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin, are predicted to bind to their target receptors within a cavity formed by the ring-like arrangement of the seven TM helices (7Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 8Wess J. Crit. Rev.

Saldanha J.W. Hulme E.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 140-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Specifically, these ligands are thought to interact with amino acids located within the exofacial segments of TM III, V, VI, and VII (7Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 8Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 9Shi L. Javitch J.A. Annu. Rev.

Sci. 2002; 23: 140-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the x-ray structure of bovine rhodopsin suggests that residues contained in the second extracellular loop (o2 loop) may also play a role in ligand (cis-retinal) binding, and, perhaps, rhodopsin activation (11Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4970) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure clearly shows that a portion of the o2 loop, the so-called β4 strand, folds deeply into the center of the TM receptor core, allowing several o2 loop residues to contact the cis-retinal ligand (11Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4970) Google Scholar). In contrast, the two other extracellular loops run along the periphery of the receptor molecule. The proper orientation of the o2 loop is maintained by a disulfide bond that is highly conserved among class I GPCRs (1Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 2Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 11Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4970) Google Scholar). One of the Cys residues involved in this disulfide bond is located in the center of the o2 loop (corresponding to Cys220 in Fig. 1), and the other one is located at the extracellular end of TM III (corresponding to Cys140 in Fig. 1). Numerous studies have shown that the presence of this conserved disulfide bond is critical for proper receptor folding and cell surface localization (see Ref. 12Zeng F.-Y. Soldner A. Schöneberg T. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2404-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and references therein). Interestingly, biochemical analysis of the D2 dopamine receptor by the substituted-cysteine accessibility method strongly suggests that the o2 loop of biogenic amine GPCRs may adopt a structure similar to that observed with bovine rhodopsin (13Shi L. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). At present, little is known about the roles of the extracellular receptor domains in the function of class I GPCRs that are activated by small diffusible ligands. In the case of the muscarinic receptors, the extracellular domains, including the o2 loop, have been shown to play important roles in the binding of certain snake toxins that prevent receptor activation by classic muscarinic agonists (14Karlsson E. Jolkkonen M. Mulugeta E. Onali P. Adem A. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 793-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Bradley K.N. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 85: 87-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Kukkonen A. Perakyla M. Akerman K.E. Nasman J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50923-50929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutagenesis studies carried out with different muscarinic receptor subtypes suggest that residues located within the o2 loop and other extracellular domains make critical contacts with allosteric muscarinic ligands (17Birdsall N.J. Lazareno S. Mini-Rev. Med. Chem. 2005; 5: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether the o2 loop, or residues contained within other extracellular receptor regions, contributes to the binding of classic muscarinic agonists and/or agonist-induced receptor activation. To address this issue, we have used the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3R), a prototypic class I GPCR that is preferentially coupled to G proteins of the Gq family (8Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), as a model system. In previous studies, we identified many residues located within different TM helices and on the intracellular receptor surface that are critical for various aspects of M3R function (8Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Because of the critical role of the o2 loop in ligand recognition in rhodopsin, we decided to investigate whether efficient M3R activation depends on the presence of specific o2 loop residues (besides the conserved Cys220 residue). In general, classic mutagenesis techniques are limited by the relatively small number of mutations that can be generated and analyzed in one particular study. We therefore decided to use random mutagenesis techniques to generate a large library of mutant M3Rs containing point mutations in the o2 loop (“o2 loop library”). To select for point mutations that interfere with M3R function, we employed a novel yeast genetic screen that allows the recovery of yeast clones expressing functionally inactive M3Rs (18Li B. Scarselli M. Knudsen C.D. Kim S.K. Jacobson K.A. McMillin S.M. Wess J. Nat. Meth. 2007; 4: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast to this approach, previous yeast genetic screens that were used to study GPCR function were all designed to recover functionally active mutants GPCRs (19Stefan C.J. Blumer K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3339-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 20Konopka J.B. Margarit S.M. Dube P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2005; 12: 320-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As is the case for the o2 loop, the potential functional roles of the N-terminal extracellular domain (N-term) has also not been studied systematically in class I GPCRs. In bovine rhodopsin, the N-term region, together with the o2 loop, forms a compact structure at the entrance of the TM-binding core (11Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4970) Google Scholar). We therefore also generated an “N-term library” of randomly mutagenized M3Rs and subjected this library to the same genetic screen as described above for the o2 loop library. Following the initial yeast screen, all receptors harboring single inactivating point mutations were expressed and characterized in more detail in transfected mammalian (COS-7) cells. In addition, we also generated and analyzed (in transfected COS-cells) a series of mutant M3Rs in which specific amino acids in the o2 loop were replaced with alanine (Ala). These Ala substitutions were introduced at sites predicted to be critical for efficient M3R activation, based on the initial characterization of the mutant M3Rs recovered in the yeast genetic screen. By using this spectrum of complementary experimental approaches, we were able to identify several o2 loop residues that are critical for efficient agonist-induced M3R activation but do not seem to play an important role in the binding of carbachol, a classic muscarinic agonist. The majority of these residues is conserved among all five muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1–M5). To our knowledge, this study represents by far the most comprehensive analysis of the functional role of the o2 loop of a class I GPCR activated by a small diffusible ligand. The experimental approach described here should be generally applicable to all GPCRs that can be expressed in yeast in a functional form. Materials—Carbamylcholine chloride (carbachol), atropine sulfate, and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole were obtained from Sigma. N-[3H]Methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS; 79–83 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Media for mammalian cell culture were from Invitrogen. Yeast media components were purchased from Qbiogene. All enzymes used for molecular cloning were from New England Biolabs. Properties of the Yeast Strain Used and Yeast Growth and Transformation—The haploid yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain MPY578q5 (MATa GPA1 far1::LYS2 fus1::FUS1-HIS3 sst2::SST2-G418r ste2::LEU2 fus2::FUS2-CAN1 ura3 lys2 ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 can1) was used as a host for the expression of all M3R constructs (27Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This strain harbors a mutant version of the endogenous GPA1 gene coding for a modified version of the Gpa1p G protein α subunit in which the last 5 amino acids of Gpa1p were replaced with the corresponding sequence derived from mammalian Gαq. Moreover, this strain lacks functional FAR1, SST2, and STE2 genes and contains the pheromone-sensitive FUS1-HIS and FUS2-CAN1 reporter genes (Fig. 2). Yeast cells were grown and transformed with plasmid DNA as described previously (24Schmidt C. Li B. Bloodworth L. Erlenbach I. Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30248-30260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Generation of Yeast Libraries Expressing Randomly Mutagenized M3Rs—For yeast expression studies, all mutations were introduced into a modified version of the rat M3R lacking the central portion of the i3 loop (Ala274–Lys469) and containing an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) and a C-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tag (Fig. 1) (18Li B. Scarselli M. Knudsen C.D. Kim S.K. Jacobson K.A. McMillin S.M. Wess J. Nat. Meth. 2007; 4: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For the sake of simplicity, this receptor is referred to as M3R(Δi3) throughout. The M3R(Δi3) coding sequence was inserted into the p416GPD yeast expression plasmid as described previously (27Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), yielding plasmid p416GPD-M3R(Δi3). The M3R(Δi3) sequence coding for the extracellular N-terminal domain of the receptor (Thr2–Gln66, Fig. 1) was subjected to PCR-based random mutagenesis to generate, on average, one nucleotide misincorporation per receptor construct (28Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Applications. 1994; 3: S136-S140Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). PCRs were carried out in 50 μl in the presence of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, 1 mm dCTP, 1 mm dTTP, 0.2 mm dATP, 0.2 mm dGTP, 0.5 μm of each primer, 50 ng of template DNA (p416GPD-M3R(Δi3)), and 3 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 35 cycles at 94 °C for 60 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. The following PCR primers were used: sense, 5′-TTA GTT TCG ACG GAT TCT AGA ACT AGA AAA ATG TAC CCC TAC GAC GTC CCC GAC TAC GCC-3′; antisense, 5′-GAT GGT CAC CAA TGC CAG GAA GCC AGT TAA GAA GGC AAT GAA GAC CAC-3′. The size of the final PCR product was 306 bp. To generate a library of yeast clones expressing mutant M3Rs containing point mutations within the extracellular N-terminal domain, we used a gap-repair protocol (27Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29Oldenburg K.R. Vo K.T. Michaelis S. Paddon C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 451-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The 306-bp PCR fragment (∼4 μg) generated under error-prone PCR conditions (see previous paragraph) was cotransformed into MPY578q5 with the p416GPD-M3R(Δi3) yeast expression plasmid (∼10 μg) that had been linearized with AatII within the region corresponding to the 306-bp PCR fragment. This procedure resulted in a yeast expression library consisting of ∼1 × 105 primary transformants (colonies that were able to grow on plates lacking uracil). Similarly, the o2 loop of the M3R(Δi3) was also subjected to random mutagenesis. In this case, we used an oligonucleotide that had been synthesized chemically under error-prone conditions (30Sommers C.M. Dumont M.E. Wess J. Structure-Function Analysis of G Protein-coupled Receptors. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1999: 141-166Google Scholar). The following sense primer coding for M3R residues Pro201 to Phe232 was synthesized by Genemed Synthesis Inc. (San Francisco, CA): 5′-CCT GCC ATC TTG TTC TGG CAA TAC TTT GTA GGG AAG AGA ACT GTG CCC CCA GGA GAA TGT TTC ATT CAG TTT CTG AGT GAG CCC ACC ATC ACC TTC-3′. The underlined sequence, which corresponds to o2 loop residues Phe205 to Pro228 (Fig. 1), was synthesized under conditions that led to one nucleotide misincorporation (on average) per molecule (the underlined sequence was doped with 1% non-wild-type nucleotides). A standard PCR was then carried out using this mutagenic sense primer together with an antisense primer (5′-GGC GGC CTT CTT CTC CTT GAT GAG-3′; corresponding to residues Leu482 to Ala489) to generate a PCR product of 246 bp. This 246-bp PCR fragment was then used as a template for a second round of PCR using a sense primer that overlapped with the first 12 nucleotides (underlined) of the mutagenic oligonucleotide (5′-ATG ATT GGT CTG GCT TGG GTC ATC TCC TTT GTC CTA TGG GCT CCT GCC ATC TTG-3′). The antisense primer was identical to the one used of the first PCR. The resulting 288-bp PCR product (∼3 μg) was cotransformed into MPY578q5 with the p416GPD-M3R(Δi3) yeast expression plasmid (∼12 μg) linearized with BstXI within the region corresponding to the 288-bp PCR fragment. This gap repair protocol (29Oldenburg K.R. Vo K.T. Michaelis S. Paddon C.

Yeast Genetic Screen to Identify Functionally Inactive Mutant M3Rs—As described in the previous paragraph, the primary yeast transformants were grown on plates containing uracil-deficient synthetic complete (SC) medium to select for Ura+ (plasmid-containing) transformants (plating density, ∼2,000–8,000 clones/150-mm plate). After incubating the plates for 2 days at 30 °C, the resulting colonies were transferred, via replica-plating, onto plates containing SC medium that lacked both uracil and arginine but contained 1 mm carbachol and 150 μg/ml canavanine. In addition, arginine was omitted from the medium because it can compete with canavanine for uptake by the Can1p transporter. A total of ∼1 × 105 yeast clones (primary transformants) was screened for each of the two libraries. Yeast clones that survived the carbachol/canavanine selection step were first studied for GFP fluorescence using the FlexStation (excitation wavelength, 485 nm; emission wavelength, 525 nm; Molecular Devices) and epi-fluorescence microscopy (AX10, Carl Zeiss). To quantitate GFP fluorescence via the use of the FlexStation, yeast cell suspensions were analyzed in a 100-μl volume using a 96-wellplate format (Fig. 3). Yeast clones that failed to display pronounced GFP fluorescence were eliminated at this step. The remaining yeast clones were subjected to a second round of screening. Specifically, plasmids were isolated from these clones, amplified in Escherichia coli (DH5α), and retransformed into MPY578q5 to confirm the plasmid linkage of the observed growth phenotype. Expression of Mutant M3Rs Recovered in the Yeast Genetic Screen in Mammalian Cells—Most inactivating point mutations recovered in the yeast genetic screen were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector (pCD-PS) coding for the full-length M3R containing an N-terminal HA and a C-terminal EGFP tag (18Li B. Scarselli M. Knudsen C.D. Kim S.K. Jacobson K.A. McMillin S.M. Wess J. Nat. Meth. 2007; 4: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For the sake of simplicity, this receptor is referred to as “WT” M3R throughout. All resulting receptor constructs were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (24Schmidt C. Li B. Bloodworth L. Erlenbach I. Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30248-30260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For receptor binding studies, COS-7 cells were transfected in 100-mm dishes, as described previously (24Schmidt C. Li B. Bloodworth L. Erlenbach I. Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30248-30260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For functional studies, COS-7 cells were seeded into 96-well plates (1.5 × 104 cells/well; catalog number 3603, Corning Glass) ∼24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 100 ng of plasmid DNA per well, using the Lipofectamine Plus kit (Invitrogen). Calcium mobilization assays were carried out 2 days after transfections (see below). Site-directed Mutagenesis—To introduce Ala substitutions at specific positions of the o2 loop of the “WT” M3R, we used the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, following the manufacturer's instructions. To generate a mutant “WT” M3R that lacked most of the extracellular N-terminal domain (M3RΔ(Nterm); amino acids Thr2–His62 were deleted), we used standard PCR-based mutagenesis techniques. The identity of all receptor constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Radioligand Binding Studies—Transfected COS-7 cells were harvested ∼72 h after transfection, and cell membranes were prepared as described in detail previously (24Schmidt C. Li B. Bloodworth L. Erlenbach I. Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30248-30260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Radioligand binding assays were carried out in a 1-ml volume using membranes prepared from transfected COS-7 cells suspended in a buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate and 5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4). Samples were incubated for 3 h at room temperature (22 °C) in the presence of the muscarinic antagonist [3H]NMS. [3H]NMS saturation binding and [3H]NMS/carbachol inhibition binding studies were carried out essentially as described (24Schmidt C. Li B. Bloodworth L. Erlenbach I. Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30248-30260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was assessed as binding remaining in the presence of 10 μm atropine. Reactions were terminated by rapidly filtration over GF/C Brandel filters, and the amount of bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Binding data were analyzed using the nonlinear curve-fitting program Prism 4.0b (GraphPad). Functional Assays (FLIPR)—Functional assays were carried out with receptor-expressing COS-7 cells 2 days after transfection. Specific"

Ligand blot analysis with heterologously expressed and purified H. armigera Bt receptor with three closely related Cry1A proteins tentatively identified HaAPN1 as an interacting ligand. However, to date there is no direct evidence of APN being a functional receptor to Cry1Ac in H. armigera. Sf21 insect cells expressing HaAPN1 displayed aberrant cell morphology upon overlaying with Cry1Ac protein. Down-regulating expression of HaAPN1 by RNA interference using double-stranded RNA correlated with a corresponding reduction in the sensitivity of HaAPN1-expressing cells to Cry1Ac protein. This clearly establishes that insect cells expressing the receptor recruit sensitivity to the insecticidal protein Cry1Ac, and their susceptibility is directly dependent on the amount of HaAPN1 protein expressed. Most importantly, silencing of HaAPN1 in H. armigera in vivo by RNA interference resulted in reduced transcript levels and a corresponding decrease in the susceptibility of larvae to Cry1Ac. BIAcore analysis of HaAPN1/Cry1Ac interaction further established HaAPN1 as a ligand for Cry1Ac.

Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) 3The abbreviations used are: Bt, B. thuringiensis; APN, aminopeptidase-N; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Cry, crystalline inclusion protein; AP, alkaline phosphatase; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; HaAPN, H. armigera APN; DEPC, diethyl pyrocarbonate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; RT, reverse transcription. is a Gram-positive soil bacterium that produces crystalline inclusions in spore mother cells. These inclusions are composed of proteins known as Cry toxins that are toxic to the larvae of different insect orders and a few other invertebrates. Several strains of Bt are used as alternative insecticides to control the important pests of agricultural crops and also public health pests, especially mosquitoes (1Schnepf E. Crickmore N. Van Rie J. Lereclus D. Baum J. Feitelson J. Zeigler D.R. Dean D.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 775-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incorporation of genes encoding these insecticidal proteins into various crops resulted in widespread cultivation of these transgenic crops. Global cultivation of these Bt-protein expressing crops resulted in economic and environmental benefits. There have been intense efforts to understand the mode of action of these insecticidal proteins. The larvae feed on the insecticidal protein, which upon solubilization in the alkaline midgut of insect is further proteolytically processed to 66-kDa mature protein that binds to specific receptors at the midgut epithelium. The activated monomeric toxin molecules oligomerize and insert into the membrane resulting in the formation of pores. The formation of the insertion pores results in osmotic imbalance of the membrane epithelium leading to collapse of the intestine and finally the death of the insect (2DeMaagd R.A. Bravo A. Crickmore N. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 193-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 3Gould F. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1998; 43: 701-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Although there is an absolute agreement on the above mentioned scheme of mode of action, the identity of the receptor(s) to these insecticidal proteins and the precise mechanism of formation of the pore in the membrane are not very clear. Two membrane proteins, cadherin and aminopeptidase-N (APN), have been implicated as possible receptors to insecticidal proteins. The putative receptor molecules have been cloned, heterologously expressed, and have been shown to bind Cry1A proteins by ligand blot analysis (4Denolf P. Hendrickx K. VanDamme J. Jansens S.

Although functional proof for cadherin as a Cry1A protein receptor has been demonstrated by cytolysis of insect cells expressing lepidopteran cadherin genes on exposure to Cry1Ab/Cry1Aa (10Nagamatsu Y. Koike T. Sasaki K. Yoshimoto A. Furukawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Tsuda Y. Nakatani F. Hashimoto K. Ikawa S. Matsuura C. Fukada T. Sugimoto K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 28051-28056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), a similar characterization of APN-Cry1A interaction has not been investigated yet. The only evidence that lepidopteran APN is a functional receptor to Cry1A comes from elegant studies by Gill and Ellar (14Gill M. Ellar D.J. Insect. Mol. Biol. 2002; 11: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). They expressed APN receptor of Manduca sexta in Drosophila and demonstrated that the transgenic fly acquired sensitivity to insecticidal protein Cry1Ab, a bioactive protein against M. sexta. We have earlier demonstrated the functional relevance of APN of Spodoptera litura to Cry1C protein (15Rajagopal R. Sivakumar S. Agrawal N. Malhotra P. Bhatnagar R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46849-46851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) by direct gene silencing strategy using RNAi. In spite of these efforts, a complete molecular characterization of the receptor to Cry1Ac protein in the major polyphagus pest Helicoverpa armigera is lacking. The insect H. armigera (family, Noctuidae; order, Lepidoptera) is the most important insect pest affecting a wide range of economically important crops. The insecticidal protein Cry1Ac is extremely effective against this insect. We have reported earlier the identification and cloning of aminopeptidases from this insect and have demonstrated HaAPN1 interaction with all the three Cry1A family of proteins (16Rajagopal R. Agrawal N. Selvapandiyan A. Sivakumar S. Ahmad S. Bhatnagar R.K. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 971-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Now we demonstrate the specificity and functional interaction of Cry1Ac protein with HaAPN1 by insect cell line (Sf21)-based assays and by specific RNAi both in cell lines and in whole insects. Affinity studies by surface plasmon resonance also revealed tight binding of Cry1Ac with HaAPN1. Membrane Preparation—The Sf21 cells infected with HaAPN1 virus (16Rajagopal R. Agrawal N. Selvapandiyan A. Sivakumar S. Ahmad S. Bhatnagar R.K. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 971-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at a multiplicity of infection of 10 were harvested after 65 h of infection. The cells were washed twice in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).The cell suspension was sonicated in cold, and the resultant suspension was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet comprising of membranes was washed twice in buffer A and finally resuspended in the same buffer, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C till further use. Ligand Blot Analysis—Membrane preparations (10 μg) of Sf-21 cells expressing HaAPN1 along with membranes from healthy uninfected cells were prepared as described earlier (16Rajagopal R. Agrawal N. Selvapandiyan A. Sivakumar S. Ahmad S. Bhatnagar R.K. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 971-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were resolved in 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking the membrane in 3% bovine serum albumin contained in PBS, they were incubated with 200 ng/ml activated Cry1Ac toxin for 1 h. The blot was then washed thrice with PBS and overlaid with Cry1Ac monoclonal antibodies for 1 h. After three washes with PBS, they were overlaid with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies. The blot was developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate after washing three times with PBS. Solubilization of the Receptor—Membrane extracts prepared from Sf21 cells expressing HaAPN1 were solubilized at 4 °C for 4 h with gentle rocking in buffer A containing anionic detergent (0.05% SDS). The undissolved materials were removed by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 60 min) at 4 °C. The detergent from the supernatant containing solubilized HaAPN1 protein was removed by detergent removal kit (Genotechnology, Inc.) and replaced with 0.1% CHAPS. The removal of the detergent was confirmed by detecting the residual detergent using detergent estimation kit (Genotechnology) in the solubilized protein and then checked for fidelity of refolding. Aminopeptidase activity was estimated following protocols described earlier (16Rajagopal R. Agrawal N. Selvapandiyan A. Sivakumar S. Ahmad S. Bhatnagar R.K. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 971-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 1-ml reaction mixture contains 67 mm Na2HPO4, 67 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, containing either l-alanine p-nitroanilide, l-leucine p-nitroanilide, or l-valine p-nitroanilide at a final concentration of 4 mm. The amount of product (p-nitroanilide) released was measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm after incubating at 37 °C. The aminopeptidase activity was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 9.9 mm p-nitroaniline at 405 nm. The membranes prepared from uninfected Sf21 cells were similarly solubilized and used as a control. Purification of Recombinant Aminopeptidase-N—Solubilized HaAPN1 was resolved through Q-Sepharose anion exchange column (4 × 20 cm). The column was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% CHAPS. A gradient of 150 mm to 1.0 m NaCl was used to elute the bound protein. All the fractions were assayed for aminopeptidase activity and profiled on SDS-PAGE. Protein fractions having HaAPN1 were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% CHAPS (buffer B). The dialyzed protein was concentrated using Centricon concentrators (Millipore) to 2 ml. The concentrated protein was further resolved using Superose H12 size exclusion chromatography that was equilibrated with buffer B mentioned above. The purity of HaAPN1 was verified on SDS-PAGE, and the fractions containing purified HaAPN1 were concentrated again using Centricon concentrators. The sample contained a near homogenous preparation (95%) of HaAPN1 protein and was used immediately for interaction analysis with Cry1Ac protein by BIAcore. The purified protein was also visualized by Western chromatography using anti-HaAPN1 antibodies (16Rajagopal R. Agrawal N. Selvapandiyan A. Sivakumar S. Ahmad S. Bhatnagar R.K. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 971-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis of HaAPN1-Cry1Ac by BIAcore—To study the interaction between Cry1Ac protein and HaAPN1, surface plasmon resonance was conducted on BIAcore 2000. The purified APN1 was diluted in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, and immobilized on flow cell 2 at a concentration of 20 μg/ml on the carboxymethylated dextran surface of a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling according to the Biosensor BIA application handbook. HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Surfactant P-20) was used throughout the analysis. After immobilization, the cell surface was regenerated with 1 m NaOH to remove unbound APN1. The analyte (Cry1Ac) was injected at different concentrations (0 nm-only buffer control, 50 nm, 100 nm, 200 nm, 400 nm, 800 nm, and 1600 nm) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min for both association and dissociation. After 300 s of association, analytes were replaced by HBS-EP for at least 300 s to dissociate. As a control, an unrelated protein Plasmodium falciparum falcipain was used as an analyte at a concentration of 400 mm and 800 nm. The data were analyzed and fitted using global analysis software available within BIAevaluation 3.1. The curves were fitted to a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model to obtain apparent rate constants. Purification of Cry1Ac Protein—The recombinant Cry1Ac toxin was prepared as inclusion bodies by the method reported earlier by Lee (17Lee M.K. Milne R.E. Ge Z. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3115-3121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from a plasmid pKK223–3 bearing the Cry1Ac gene (Bacillus Genetic Stock Centre, Columbus, OH). The amount of the toxin was quantitated densitometrically by resolving the inclusion bodies on SDS-PAGE. The inclusion bodies containing the toxin were solubilized in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 10.4, and activated with trypsin (Sigma) at a 10:1 ratio for 30 min. at 37 °C. This activated toxin was purified by anion exchange chromatography and eluted with 0–1000 mm NaCl gradient in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 10.4. This fraction containing Cry1Ac protein was concentrated and simultaneously dialyzed with PBS in a Centricon (Millipore) concentrator to a final concentration of 200 ng/μl. Culturing of Sf-21 Cells—Sf-21 (Invitrogen) cells were grown and maintained at 27 °C in TNM-FH medium (Pharmingen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin. Cells were grown as a monolayer up to 70–80% confluence in T-75 (Nunc) tissue culture flasks. Toxin Overlay of Sf-21 Cells—Actively growing Sf-21 cells were harvested from a 70–80% confluent T-75 flask and transferred to a 48-well tissue culture dish (Costar) at 0.1 × 106 cells per well. After the cells settled down for 2 h, they were infected with HaAPN1 baculovirus (16Rajagopal R. Agrawal N. Selvapandiyan A. Sivakumar S. Ahmad S. Bhatnagar R.K. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 971-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 for a period of 1 h. Subsequently the virus was removed, and the cells were overlaid with TNM-FH medium and maintained at 27 °C. After 48 h, the TNM-FH medium was removed, and the cell layer was washed gently twice with PBS, pH 7.4, and overlaid with 150 μl of activated Cry1Ac insecticidal protein in PBS at 25 μg/ml. The cells were also overlaid with P. falciparum falcipain to act as a control. The cells were incubated with the proteins for a period of 5 h, after which they were observed under a Nikon TE-300 microscope. The total number of cells swelled in a field was counted in comparison to the total cells present in the field. Final values represent an average of four fields selected for each treatment, and each treatment was replicated three times. dsRNA Synthesis—The full-length cDNA of haapn1 (AF521659) from the midgut of H. armigera larvae was already reported by us (16Rajagopal R. Agrawal N. Selvapandiyan A. Sivakumar S. Ahmad S. Bhatnagar R.K. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 971-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 565-bp internal fragment of haapn1 was obtained by PCR using the primers HaAPN1–53F 5′-GTTAGCTCGAGCTGGCATT-3′ and HaAPN1–54R 5′-TGTGGTCTTGAGGCCGAGTCAT-3′. The truncated fragment of H. armigera haapn1 was subcloned in pGEM-Te and used for the preparation of dsRNA. As a control, the gene for falcipain of P. falciparum cloned in pGEM-T was used as described earlier (18Malhotra P. Dasaradhi P.V.N. Kumar A. Mohammed A. Agrawal N. Bhatnagar R.K. Chauhan V.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The pGEM-Te-cloned fragments were amplified by PCR using vector-specific universal and reverse primers (Promega). The PCR product was purified (Qiagen GmbH) and used as DNA template for dsRNA preparation after the in vitro transcription procedure described by us (18Malhotra P. Dasaradhi P.V.N. Kumar A. Mohammed A. Agrawal N. Bhatnagar R.K. Chauhan V.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases (MBI Fermentas) were used to generate single strand sense RNA and antisense RNA, respectively, from the DNA. To make dsRNA, equal amounts of sense RNA and antisense RNA were mixed, heated to 65 °C, and annealed by slow cooling over 4 h followed by DNase (Invitrogen) treatment for 15 min at 37 °C. The dsRNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated overnight with ice-cold ethanol in the presence of 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.4, at –20 °C. The dsRNA pellet was washed with 75% ethanol and resuspended in DEPC-treated water to a concentration of 1 μg/μl dsRNA. RNAi in Sf-21 Cells—After the cells were infected with HaAPN1 baculovirus at an multiplicity of infection of 0.5 for 1 h, the virus-containing TNM-FH medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice gently with 500 μl of serum-free medium, Sf900II (Invitrogen) taking care not to disrupt the cells. These cells were overlaid with 10 μg of dsRNA of haapn1 in 150 μl of serum-free medium and incubated for 2 h at 27 °C. 400 μl of TNM-FH was subsequently added to each well, and the cells were maintained at 27 °C for 48 h. Cells were harvested from each treatment for RNA transcript analysis and Western blot analysis. The other set of cells was processed for toxin overlay as described earlier for toxin overlay of Sf-21 cells. These experiments were replicated four times. Insect Populations—Continuous population of H. armigera was maintained in an insectary with a controlled environment of 25 ± 1 °C, 55–60% relative humidity, a photophase of 14 h, and 10 h of scotophase. The larvae were reared on the chickpea based semisynthetic diet (19Singh A.K. Rembold H. Int. J. Tropic. Insect Sci. 1992; 13: 333-338Crossref Google Scholar). 5th-instar larvae were used for the bioassays. Micro-injection of dsRNA—About 6 μg(1 μg/μl) of dsRNA of haapn1 was injected intra-hemocoelically into the 1st-day 5th-instar larvae (130 ± 10 mg). A Hamilton microsyringe attached to a programmable micro-applicator (KDS 200, KD Scientific Inc., New Hope, PA) was used for this purpose. The larvae injected with 6 μl of DEPC-treated water served as control. After 2 days of incubation, the total RNA was isolated from the midgut tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. The mRNA was purified from the total RNA by using biotinylated oligo-dT and streptavidin magnetic particles (Roche Applied Science) and was used as template for real time reverse transcriptase-PCR (real time RT-PCR). Western Blot Analysis of RNAi-treated Sf-21 Cells and Insect Guts—For Western blotting the cells were harvested and processed as per the procedure described earlier (34Agrawal A. Malhotra P. Bhatnagar R.K. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The total cell extract was resolved in 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred on to nitrocellulose membranes. Whole insect midgut samples stored in Trizol were processed, and their protein fractions were extracted by following the manufacturer's (Invitrogen) instructions. After transfer, the membrane was incubated for 60 min in blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in 1× PBS) and washed three times with 1× PBS. To have a rough estimate on the amount of protein loaded (loading controls), the same samples were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and similarly processed as described above. The blot was probed with 1:2500 dilutions of anti-β actin or anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibodies for 60 min. The membranes were probed with 1:2500 dilutions of anti-APN antibodies for 60 min and washed three times with 1× PBS. AP-conjugated goat antirabbit secondary antibodies (Calbiochem) diluted 1:5000 in 1% bovine serum albumin was overlaid on the membrane for 60 min. After 3 washings with 1× PBS, the blot was developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrates (Roche Diagnostics) in alkaline phosphatase buffer. Cry1Ac Bioassay on H. armigera 5th-instar Larvae—Inclusion bodies of Cry1Ac toxin were prepared as reported earlier by Lee (17Lee M.K. Milne R.E. Ge Z. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3115-3121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of the toxin was quantitated densitometrically by resolving the inclusion bodies on SDS-PAGE. Toxin amounts from 500 to 10,000 ng was diluted in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and applied on 1-cm2 artificial diet. The toxincoated diet was air-dried and placed in a well of a 12-well tissue culture plate (Nunc Inc). One 5th-instar 3rd-day H. armigera larva was released on each well and exposed to the toxin treatment for 24 h. After 24 h the larva was transferred to a fresh diet (without toxin). Mortality was recorded after 4 days, and the LC50 value was calculated by Probit analysis using the software Indo Stat (Indostat Services, Hyderabad, India). Ten larvae were tested for each treatment, and the bioassay was replicated three times. LC50 values were similarly determined for 5th-instar 3rd-day larvae of H. armigera starved for 2 days. Real Time RT-PCR Analysis of RNAi Treatment—Total RNA was extracted from the Sf-21 cells or dissected midguts using TriZol (Invitrogen) reagent following the manufacturer's instruction and subjected to real time RT-PCR. Real time RT-PCR was performed using the Quanti Tect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen Gmbh) and the iCycler TM (Bio-Rad). Primers mentioned earlier and used for the cloning of the truncated fragments were used for the analysis. The real time amplification and analysis was performed in triplicate in PCR reactions of 25 μl final volume containing 7.5 pmol of each forward and reverse primers. Transcript of β-actin was used as the internal reference to normalize the transcripts of dsRNA treatment and control. The β-actin amplicon was obtained by using the primers β-actin F (5′-CAGATCATGTTTGAGACCTTCAAC-3′) and β-actin R (5′-GSCCATCTCYTGCTCGAARTC-3′). Normalized data were used to quantitate the relative levels of a given mRNA in control and dsRNA-injected larvae according to the ΔΔCt analysis (20Pfaffl M.W.

Interaction of HaAPN1-expressing Sf21 Cells with Cry1Ac Toxin—HaAPN1 expressed in the membrane fractions of Sf-21 cells infected with haapn1 baculovirus showed a positive interaction with Cry1Ac protein on ligand blot analysis (Fig. 1A). There was an increase in intensity with an increase in HaAPN1 concentration, suggesting that the interaction was specific and dose-dependent. Preliminary experiments of titrating membrane preparations of Sf21 cells expressing HaAPN1 with anti-HaAPN1 antibodies revealed a positive interacting protein corresponding to the expected size of HaAPN1. The biological functional significance of heterologous expression of HaAPN1 was further investigated by exposing insect cells (Sf21) expressing HaAPN1 to various concentrations of insecticidal protein Cry1Ac. Incubation of live, viable cells expressing HaAPN1 with Cry1Ac induced distinct morphological changes. A significant proportion of cells displayed swelling and lysis, and such effects were not observed in healthy Sf21 cells, suggesting that the expressing HaAPN1 directly interacts with the insecticidal protein, and as a result morphological aberrations are induced (Fig. 1, B–E). The number of cells with such alterations after Cry1Ac overlay was counted in four different optic fields. Nearly 32% of cells were either ruptured or were swollen and appeared abnormal (Table 1). The cells when incubated with an unrelated protein to Cry1Ac, falcipain, did not show any morphological aberration.TABLE 1Percentage of HaAPN1-expressing Sf-21 cells displaying morphological aberrations after incubation with 3.75 μg of activated Cry1Ac toxin for a period of 5 h All values are the average of four sets of observations, and each treatment was replicated three times (thus, an average of 4 × 3 = 12 observations).

Sf-21 cells, after infection with haapn1 baculovirus, were incubated for 2 h with dsRNA of HaAPN1. The abundance of haapn1 transcript was estimated by RT-PCR, and the amount of expressed protein was estimated by Western blot analysis using anti-APN1 antibodies. Fortyeight hours after dsRNA treatment, the expression of HaAPN1 mRNA and protein was drastically reduced in dsRNA-treated cells as compared with control cells and cells treated with dsRNA unrelated to falcipain. The transcript reduction due to dsRNA incubation on HaAPN1-infected cells were around 70% (Fig. 2A). A similar reduction was observed in the HaAPN1 protein expression profile after dsRNA treatment (Fig. 2A, inset). Overlay of Cry1Ac insecticidal protein on such haa"
https://openalex.org/W2067946759,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is an important negative regulator of cell growth and a tumor suppressor. Its growth-attenuating activity is based on the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), an essential second messenger for the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. This activity may require localization of PTEN to cytoplasmic membranes. Yet PTEN can also localize to the cell nucleus where its functions remain unclear. Here we present data that define a short sequence in the N-terminal region of PTEN required for cytoplasmic localization. We will refer to this sequence as cytoplasmic localization signal (CLS). It could function as a non-canonical signal for nuclear export or as a cytoplasmic retention signal of PTEN. Mutations within the CLS induce nuclear localization and impair growth suppressive activities of PTEN while preserving lipid phosphatase activity. We propose that nuclear localization of PTEN is not compatible with plasma membrane-targeted growth suppressive functions of PTEN."
https://openalex.org/W2111285897,"Ca2+ regulation of the Ca2+ binding mitochondrial carriers for aspartate/glutamate (AGCs) is provided by their N-terminal extensions, which face the intermembrane space. The two mammalian AGCs, aralar and citrin, are members of the malate-aspartate NADH shuttle. We report that their N-terminal extensions contain up to four pairs of EF-hand motifs plus a single vestigial EF-hand, and have no known homolog. Aralar and citrin contain one fully canonical EF-hand pair and aralar two additional half-pairs, in which a single EF-hand is predicted to bind Ca2+. Shuttle activity in brain or skeletal muscle mitochondria, which contain aralar as the major AGC, is activated by Ca2+ with S0.5 values of 280–350 nm; higher than those obtained in liver mitochondria (100–150 nm) that contain citrin as the major AGC. We have used aralar- and citrin-deficient mice to study the role of the two isoforms in heart, which expresses both AGCs. The S0.5 for Ca2+ activation of the shuttle in heart mitochondria is about 300 nm, and it remains essentially unchanged in citrin-deficient mice, although it undergoes a drastic reduction to about 100 nm in aralar-deficient mice. Therefore, aralar and citrin, when expressed as single isoforms in heart, confer differences in Ca2+ activation of shuttle activity, probably associated with their structural differences. In addition, the results reveal that the two AGCs fully account for shuttle activity in mouse heart mitochondria and that no other glutamate transporter can replace the AGCs in this pathway.

Ca2+ signaling in mitochondria is important for regulating mitochondrial function in response to intra- and extracellular cues. The main mechanism whereby Ca2+ modulates mitochondrial function involves Ca2+ entry in mitochondria via the Ca2+ uniporter (CU) or rapid uptake mode (RAM) mechanisms (14Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. J.

Brain mitochondria have aralar as the only AGC isoform, and we have recently shown that MAS activity in brain mitochondria is stimulated by extramitochondrial Ca2+ with an S0.5 for Ca2+ activation of around 320 nm (29Pardo B.

This opened up the possibility that neuronal MAS might be activated by cytosolic Ca2+ signals below the threshold of the calcium uniporter. Indeed, with the use of two photon microscopy imaging of mitochondrial NAD(P)H and neuronal cultures derived from aralar-deficient mice (30Jalil M.A. Begum L. Contreras L. Pardo B. Iijima M. Li M.X.

Aralar and citrin have differences in primary sequence, especially along their N-terminal halves but a very high identity along their MC homology sequence (3del Arco A. Agudo M. Satrustegui J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which explains the very similar transport activity of both isoforms (5Palmieri L. Pardo B. Lasorsa F.M. del Arco A.

In the present work, we have studied whether the differences in their N-terminal sequences could lead to differences in calcium regulation. By studying Ca2+ activation of MAS activity in tissues expressing the individual isoforms, we conclude that citrin has a smaller capacity to be activated by calcium than aralar, with an S0.5 of about 100–150 nm. We have next used this information to study the role of aralar and citrin in heart MAS activity. MAS is the dominant NADH shuttle in heart, (31LaNoue K.F. Walajtys E.I. Williamson J.R. J. Biol.

Unlike skeletal muscle, which expresses only aralar, the heart shows high levels of both isoforms, with a preferential enrichment of aralar in atria (38del Arco A. Morcillo J. Martinez-Morales J.R.

It is lower in adults than in neonates, and this has been attributed to a postnatal decrease in the levels of the oxoglutarate-malate carrier (OGC) observed in pig and rabbit, which could limit shuttle function in adult heart (36Scholz T.D.

To get a better understanding of the role of aralar and citrin in MAS heart activity and regulation by calcium, we have studied the effects of the selective deficiency of the two isoforms, aralar and citrin by employing mice with targeted disruption of each of the two genes. The results underscore a predominant role of aralar as the isoform that confers Ca2+ regulation to heart MAS activity and strongly suggest that no other carrier can substitute for the AGCs in MAS.

The HMMs were then used to search the N-terminal sequences of the aralar-like subfamily of proteins previously obtained from the Uniprot data base (43Apweiler R. Bairoch A. Wu C.H. Barker W.C. Boeckmann B. Ferro S. Gasteiger E. Huang H. Lopez R. Magrane M. Martin M.J. Natale D.A. O'Donovan C. Redaschi N. Yeh L.S.

BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; 3: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) to study the distribution of EF-hand protein superfamilies. The putative structure of discovered EF-hands was contrasted with the secondary structure prediction of MSAs of aralar and citrin sequences to ensure structural compatibility. Materials—Fura2-pentapotassium salt and CalciumGreen-5N were from Molecular Probes. MDH was from Boehringer, digitonin from Fluka, bovine serum albumin (fraction V) from Intergen, and the rest of the reagents were from Sigma. Animals—The mouse strains used were C57BL/6, C56BL/6xSv129, and Sv129 obtained from Harlam. Aralar+/+, Aralar+/–, and Aralar–/– mice were generated as described previously (30Jalil M.A. Begum L.

Mice with targeted disruption of the citrin gene were obtained by gene trapping at Lexicon Genetics (The Woodlands, TX) in SVJ129 ES cells using the insertion vector method that was based on the gene trap technology of Lexicon (45Zambrowicz B.P. Friedrich G.A. Buxton E.C. Lilleberg S.L. Person C. Sands A.T.

Slc25a13+/– ES cells were injected into C57BL blastocysts, and chimeric mice were bred to C57BL (albino) wild-type mice. Slc25a13+/– mice with a SVJ129xC57BL/6 inbred genetic background were backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice for at least 8 generations. The resulting slc25a13+/– (Citrin+/–) offspring were interbred to produce slc25a13–/– (Citrin–/–) mice and Citrin+/+ mice in a C57BL/6 genetic background. All mouse strains and male Wistar rats were housed with a 12-h light cycle and fed ad libitum on a standard chow. Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, the tissue of interest quickly dissected and kept on ice-cold media for mitochondrial isolation carried out at 4 °C. Rats were 3-months old. Unless indicated otherwise, mice were used at 15 days to allow comparisons between strains, as mice from one of the strains used, Aralar–/–, do not survive beyond 20 days (30Jalil M.A. Begum L.

All animal procedures were approved by the Committee for Animal Experimentation, Kagoshima University and European guidelines. Genotyping—Aralar-deficient mice were genotyped as described previously (30Jalil M.A. Begum L. Contreras L. Pardo B. Iijima M. Li M.X. Ramos M. Marmol P. Horiuchi M. Shimotsu K. Nakagawa S. Okubo A.

After determining the insertion site of the trap vector, the citrin genotype was analyzed by the duplex-PCR method. To this end, the sense primer -mCit Ex7F (5′-CgCTCCTTAACAACATggAAC-3′)/mCit 3′LTR-F3 (5′-gTTCTCTAgAAACTgCTgAgg-3′) within the exon 7/vector, and common antisense primer-mCit int 7B1 (5′-TCTgATCAAggTCTggAggAC-3′) within intron 7 were used to amplify both the wild-type and mutant alleles, and the PCR products were visualized following separation on a 2% agarose gel. Brain and Liver Mitochondria—Whole brain or liver were washed, minced, and homogenized in IM (mm: 250 sucrose, 25 Hepes, 10 KCl, 1 EDTA, 1 EGTA, 1.5 MgCl2, 1 dithiothreitol, 1 phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 1 iodoacetamide, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Nuclei and cell debris were first removed by 10 min of centrifugation at 700 × g, and mitochondrial fractions were then spun down (15 min, 10,000 × g), and washed in MSK (mm: 75 mannitol, 25 sucrose, 5 potassium phosphate, 20 Tris-HCl, 0.5 EDTA, 100 KCl, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Mitochondria were resuspended in MSK and kept on ice until used. Brain mitochondrial fractions correspond to crude preparations containing synaptosomes and free mitochondria (46Martinez-Serrano A. Satrustegui J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Skeletal Muscle Mitochondria—Skeletal muscle mitochondria were obtained as described by Rolfe et al. (47Rolfe D.F. Hulbert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Skeletal muscle was obtained from the four limbs, washed, and minced in IMM (mm; 100 sucrose, 9 EDTA, 1 EGTA, 100 Tris-HCl, 46 KCl, pH7.4). After 10 min of incubation with Nagarse (0.4 mg/ml IMM; stirring on ice), the tissue was homogenized and processed as described for brain and liver. Heart Mitochondria—Hearts were treated the same way as skeletal muscle, except that the medium for isolation was IMH, mm: 230 manitol, 70 sucrose, 1 EDTA, 5 Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (48Han D. Antunes F.

MAS activity was started by the addition of 5 mm glutamate, and was determined from the decay in NADH fluorescence at 37 °C under constant stirring. To correct for any possible changes in free calcium concentration along the assay, the experiments have been also carried out in EGTA-calcium-buffered MSK medium, in which EDTA was replaced with 0.5 mm EGTA. Free Calcium Calibration—The free calcium concentrations were determined fluorimetrically with Fura-2 (below 1 μm free calcium) and Calcium-Green (above 1 μm free calcium) as described (29Pardo B.

The concentrations of Fura-2 (Kd = 224 nm; excitation, 340 and 380 nm; emission, 510 nm) and CalciumGreen (Kd = 14 μm; excitation, 506 nm; emission, 532 nm) were 5 and 0.1 μm, respectively. The free calcium concentration was obtained by established procedures for ratiometric or non-ratiometric probes (52Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol.

Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (8%), transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and dyed with Ponceau Red, to assess for protein load. The membranes were blocked and incubated for 2 h with antibodies raised against either aralar (2del Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol.

After extensive washing, membranes were incubated for 45 min with a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:10000, Bio-Rad), and the signal was detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, PerkinElmer), as described earlier (38del Arco A.

EF-hands in Citrin and Aralar—Using an HMM-based methodology, similar to those used by Truong and Ikura (44Truong K. Ikura M. BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; 3: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) in the superfamily of EF-hands-containing proteins, we found a surprising amount of EF-hand compatible motifs in the sequence of both aralar (AGC1) and citrin (AGC2). Up to nine different EF-hands were predicted using this procedure, all located in the first 330–340 amino acids of members of this family of proteins (Fig. 1), the ninth EF-hand (positions 302–330 in human aralar)"
https://openalex.org/W2027584688,"CD34(+) bone marrow blasts from high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients as well as MDS patient-derived cell lines (P39 and MOLM13) constitutively activate the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway and undergo apoptosis when NF-kappaB is inhibited. Here, we show that the combination of conventional chemotherapeutic agents (daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, 5-azacytidine or camptothecin) with the NF-kappaB inhibitor BAY11-7082 did not yield a synergistic cytotoxicity. In contrast, BAY11-7082 (which targets the NF-kappaB-activating I-kappaB kinase (IKK) complex) or knockdown of essential components of the NF-kappaB system (such as the IKK1 and IKK2 subunits of the IKK complex and the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB), by small interfering RNAs sensitized MDS cell lines to starvation-induced apoptosis. The combination of BAY11-7082 and nutrient depletion synergistically killed the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line U937 as well as primary CD34(+) bone marrow blasts from AML and high-risk MDS patients. The synergistic killing by BAY11-7082, combined with nutrient depletion, led to cell death accompanied by all hallmarks of apoptosis, including an early loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria, activation of caspase-3, phosphatidylserine exposure on the plasma membrane surface and nuclear chromatin condensation. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of numerous autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm before cells underwent nuclear apoptosis. Nonetheless, cell death was neither inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk nor by knockdown of AIF or of essential components of the autophagy pathway (ATG5, ATG6/Beclin-1, ATG10, ATG12). In contrast, external supply of glucose, insulin or insulin-like growth factor-I could retard the cell death induced by BAY11-7082 combined with starvation. These results suggest that in MDS cells, NF-kappaB inhibition can precipitate a bioenergetic crisis that leads to an autophagic stress response followed by apoptotic cell death."

Expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments is a prerequisite for high rate synthesis, assembly, and secretion of immunoglobulins. The bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulates murine B-cells to proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting cells that morphologically resemble plasma cells. LPS activation of CH12 B-cells augmented phospholipid production and initiated a genetic program, including elevated expression of the genes for the synthesis, elongation, and desaturation of fatty acids that supply the phospholipid acyl moieties. Likewise, many of the genes in phospholipid biosynthesis were up-regulated, most notably those encoding Lipin1 and choline phosphotransferase. In contrast, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase α (CCTα) protein, a key control point in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, increased because of stabilization of protein turnover rather than transcriptional activation. Furthermore, an elevation in cellular diacylglycerol and fatty acid correlated with enhanced allosteric activation of CCTα by the membrane lipids.

The unfolded protein response mediates a novel splicing of XBP-1 mRNA to yield XBP-1(S), a basic leucine zipper protein with a transactivation domain. Indeed, heterologous enforced expression of XBP-1(S) in fibroblasts is sufficient to stimulate synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), the primary phospholipid of the ER membrane, leading to increased intracellular membrane surface area and volume of ER and increased cell size (8Sriburi R.

The targets of transcriptional activation that drive membrane phospholipid synthesis during plasma cell maturation remain elusive, however, as expression of the genes of the PtdCho biosynthetic pathway are not significantly stimulated during XBP-1(S) induction (8Sriburi R.

Fagone P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 853-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the supply of CDP-choline is governed by the activity of CCT. Three CCT isoforms are expressed differentially in tissues, but CCTα is the dominant isoform that is expressed ubiquitously (12Karim M.A. Jackson P. Jackowski S. Biochim. Biophys.

The rate of membrane PtdCho synthesis increases via stabilization of the transcript encoding CCTα when macrophages proliferate in response to colony-stimulating factor-1 (14Hirabayashi Y. Kanamori A.

In addition to mechanisms that regulate CCT protein expression or modification, the biochemical activity of the enzyme is controlled by the membrane lipid composition as CCT responds to both activators and inhibitors embedded in the PtdCho matrix (24Attard G.S.

Finally, in the last step of PtdCho synthesis, the CPT uses both CDP-choline and DAG as substrates.

Arnold L.W. Bishop G.A. Mercolino T.J. Immunol. Rev. 1986; 93: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), was employed as a model system to look into the changes in lipid metabolism responsible for the acceleration of membrane phospholipid synthesis to support the differentiation of activated B-cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Similar to splenic B-cells, CH12 cells bear surface IgM and class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex, and less than 3% secrete IgM under normal culture conditions (32Arnold L.W. LoCascio N.J. Lutz P.M. Pennell C.A. Klapper D. Haughton G. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 2064-2068PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ovnic M. Corley R.B. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3075-3082PubMed Google Scholar). Differentiation and Ig secretion are induced either by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure or by T-cells (33Ovnic M. Corley R.B. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3075-3082PubMed Google Scholar, 34LoCascio N.J.

Argon Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1501-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Analysis of the ultrastructural changes of CH12 cells during differentiation showed a 3-6-fold increase in the surface area of ER and Golgi and a similar increase in ER resident proteins as shown by EM and immunoblotting, respectively (1Wiest D.L. Burkhardt J.K. Hester S. Hortsch M. Meyer D.I. Argon Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1501-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Our work defines a complex pattern of genetic and biochemical alterations in lipid metabolism that lead to expansion of the intracellular membrane network in LPS-induced differentiation of CH12 B-cells. CH12 B-cell Culture—The CH12 B-cell lymphoma cell line (31Haughton G. Arnold L.W. Bishop G.A. Mercolino T.J. Immunol. Rev. 1986; 93: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was maintained by weekly passage as an ascites tumor in B10.A mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Cells were harvested by peritoneal lavage and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented as described previously (4Gass J.N. Gifford N.M. Brewer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49047-49054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). CH12 B-cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml, and differentiation was induced by exposure to 25 μg/ml LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5, Sigma) (31Haughton G. Arnold L.W. Bishop G.A. Mercolino T.J. Immunol. Rev. 1986; 93: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Splenic B-cells were isolated from C57BL6/J mice by a depletion strategy using a B-cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All procedures involving mice were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of both St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and Loyola University Medical Center. Lipid Extraction—CH12 cell pellets (2 × 107 cells) were resuspended in 1 ml of water or PBS. The total volume was measured, and a 100-μl aliquot was removed for protein determination. Lipids were extracted from a 900-μl aliquot by the method of Bligh and Dyer (37Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) using 2.4 ml of acetic acid in methanol (2%, v/v) and 1 ml of chloroform in the first step, followed by 1.5 ml of chloroform and 1.2 ml of water in the second step to yield two phases, organic and aqueous. The organic phase was collected and dried. Phospholipid Mass and Fatty Acid Distribution—Lipids extracted from CH12 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). A 1-μl aliquot was loaded onto a thin layer silica gel rod and developed first in ether, dried, and then developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50: 25:8:2, v/v). Lipids were detected by flame ionization using an Iatroscan Instrument (Iatron Laboratories), and peaks were integrated with PEAKSIMPLE software (SRI Instruments). Peaks were identified by comigration with authentic standards. PtdCho and PtdEtn masses were calculated using standard curves for each. Lipids extracted from CH12 cells were resuspended in anhydrous methanol and converted into fatty acid methyl esters by addition of few drops of acetyl chloride followed by overnight incubation at room temperature. The solvent was dried under nitrogen, and the methyl esters were recovered by extraction using hexane/water (1:2, v/v). The organic phase was dried under nitrogen, and the methyl esters were dissolved into carbon disulfide and analyzed using a HP 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary GC column: DB-225, 30 m × 0.53 mm, 0.5 μm (J & W Scientific). Methyl esters were identified by their retention times as determined using gas-liquid chromatography methyl ester standards in the FIM-FAME-7 mixture (Matreya). Phospholipid Electrospray-MS/MS Analysis—Mass spectrometry (MS) of PtdCho was performed by the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Approximately 50 μg of total lipid was dissolved in 0.25 ml of chloroform/methanol 50:50 (v/v) + 1% formic acid. MS analysis was performed using a Finnigan™ TSQ® Quantum (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with the nanospray ion source. Samples were introduced via static nanoelectrospray using EconTips™ (New Objective, Woburn, MA). The instrument was operated in the positive ion mode using parent ion scanning for PtdCho. Ion source parameters were as follows: spray voltage 1000 V, capillary temperature 270 °C, capillary offset 35 V, and tube lens offset was set by infusion of the poly-tyrosine tuning and calibration solution (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) in electrospray mode. MS acquisition parameters for PtdCho were as follows: scan range 600-900 m/z, scan time 0.3 s, product mass 184.1 m/z, collision energy 40 V, peak width Q1 and Q3 0.7 FWHM, and Q2 CID gas 0.5 millitorr. Instrument control and data acquisition were performed with the Finnigan™ Xcalibur™ (version 1.4 SR1) software (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA). IgM Secretion Rates and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—CH12 cells, cultured for 24 and 48 h with or without LPS, were harvested and washed. Cells were subcultured at 2 × 105 viable cells/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h; the amount of IgM secreted in the medium was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using goat anti-mouse IgM, μ chain-specific, goat anti-mouse κ-alkaline phosphatase, κ chain-specific (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL), and 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (Sigma) as substrate. Enzyme Assays—CK and CCT activities in CH12 cell lysates were measured as described previously (8Sriburi R. Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The activation of CCT by CH12 cell lipids was measured using purified recombinant CCTα protein. Recombinant rodent CCTα was expressed as histidine-tagged protein in SF9 insect cells and purified by metal-affinity and size-exclusion chromatographies using a HiTrap™ chelating HP column and a HiLoad™ 16/60 Superdex™ 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, enzymatic activity was measured by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min of 0.5 μg/ml recombinant CCTα in assay buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) in the presence of 1 mm CTP, 1 mm phosphocholine labeled with 3.2 μCi/mmol [14C]phosphocholine (55 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and LUVs at concentrations ranging from 10 to 200 μg/ml. The enzymatic reaction was stopped with 400 mm EDTA (5 μl for 50 μl assay volume). Substrate and product were separated using Silica Gel H layers developed with methanol, 0.1 m NaCl, ammonium hydroxide (50:50:5, v/v) and identified by co-migration with authentic standards. The radioactivity associated with reagent and product was measured using a BIOSCAN AR-2000 imaging system. CCTα affinity for lipid was expressed as half-maximal stimulatory activity and was calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 4 software, version 4.00 (Graph-Pad software, Inc.). LUVs were prepared from lipids extracted from CH12 cells that were resuspended in buffer (15 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) to a final phospholipid concentration of 1 mg/ml by vortexing and sonication. LUVs were extruded through a 100 nm pore diameter polycarbonate membrane, and the phospholipid concentration was determined colorimetrically using ammonium ferrothiocyanite (38Charles J. Stewart M. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 104: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). LUVs were stored at 4 °C and used within 2 days of preparation. CPT activity in CH12 microsomes, prepared from frozen cell pellets, was determined as described previously (8Sriburi R. Jackowski S. Mori K. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 39Henneberry A.L. McMaster C.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). DAG Quantification—DAG was quantified in lipids extracted from cells according to the protocol of Preiss et al. (40Preiss J.E. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. Niedel J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The extracted samples or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol standard (Avanti, Alabaster, AL) were solubilized in octyl-β-d-glucoside/cardiolipin, and DAG mass was determined by enzymatic assay in a reaction buffer containing 100 mm imidazole HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, pH 6.6, 20 mm DTT, DAG kinase (Calbiochem), and 10 mm ATP plus 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) and 1% HClO4, and the [32P]phosphatidic acid product was extracted using chloroform, 1% HClO4 (1:1, v/v). After centrifugation at 5,000 × g to separate the phases, the upper layer was discarded, and the lower layer, which contained [32P]phosphatidic acid product, was washed twice with 1% HClO4 and dried under vacuum. The dried samples were dissolved in 5% methanol in chloroform and fractionated on TLC plates developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:27:8, v/v). Spots corresponding to the phosphatidic acid were scraped and counted for the radioactivity using scintillation spectroscopy. Metabolic Labeling—CH12 B-cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml in medium with or without 25 μg/ml LPS. At times after LPS addition, cells were harvested and resuspended in CH12 medium containing 6 μm choline and supplemented with 10 μCi/ml methyl[3H]choline (specific activity, 85 Ci/mmol) or 2 μCi/ml [2-14C]acetate (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol), obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. After labeling for 2, 2.5, or 3 h, cells were harvested, counted, and subjected to extraction according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (37Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). The amount of radiolabel incorporated into the organic and aqueous phases was quantified by scintillation counting. A 50-μl aliquot of each aqueous phase was spotted onto Silica Gel H layers (Analtech) that were developed in methanol, 0.1 m NaCl, ammonium hydroxide (50: 50:5, v/v). Choline, phosphocholine, and CDP-choline were identified by co-migration with standards and the bands excised; the fractional distribution of choline intermediates was determined by scintillation counting of the excised bands. The rate of [14C]acetate incorporation (2 h) into FA and DAG was estimated by TLC of the organic phase using CHCl3/methanol/acetic acid (98:2:1, v/v). FA and DAG were detected and identified by co-migration with [14C]dioleoyl-glycerol and [14C]oleic acid (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) using a Typhoon 9200 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) after exposure of the TLC plate to a phosphorus screen, and the band intensities were quantified using ImageQuant software, version 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences). CPT Assay in Permeabilized Cells—CH12 B-cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml in medium with or without 25 μg/ml LPS. At times after LPS addition, cells were harvested and resuspended at 108 cells/ml in 50 μl of labeling medium as follows: choline-free culture medium supplemented with 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 80 μm digitonin, 0.02% Tween 20, and 100 μm [14C]CDP-choline 0.9 μCi/ml (American Radiolabeled Chemicals). Cells were incubated for 4 min at 37 °C; reactions were stopped by adding 240 μl of 2% acetic acid in methanol. Lipids were extracted as described earlier, and the amount of choline incorporated into PtdCho was estimated by scintillation spectroscopy. RNA Transcript Measurements—Total RNA was isolated from CH12 B-cells cultured with or without LPS for 3, 24, or 48 h using TRIzol (Invitrogen); contaminating genomic DNA was removed by digestion with DNase I, and aliquots were stored as an ethanol precipitate at -20 °C. cDNA was prepared from RNA by reverse transcription using Super-Script II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers. Primers and probes for real time qRT-PCR were designed using Primer Express® software (version 2.0; Applied Biosystems) and are listed in Table 1. Real time qRT-PCR was carried out using the 7300 Real Time PCR System and 7300 System SDS software (version 1.2.3; Applied Biosystems). The Taqman Rodent GAPDH control reagent (Applied Biosystems) was the source of the primers and probes for quantifying the control Gapdh mRNA. The collected data were analyzed using the CT method (41Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar); the amount of target RNA was normalized to the endogenous Gapdh reference and related to the amount of target RNA in untreated cells.

https://openalex.org/W2102139659,"Keratin 8 (K8) and keratin-18 (K18) are the major intermediate filament proteins in the intestinal epithelia. The regulation and function of keratin in the intestinal epithelia is largely unknown. In this study we addressed the role and regulation of K8 and K18 expression by interleukin 6 (IL-6). Caco2-BBE cell line and IL-6 null mice were used to study the effect of IL-6 on keratin expression. Keratin expression was studied by Northern blot, Western blot, and confocal microscopy. Paracellular permeability was assessed by apical-to-basal transport of a fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran probe (FD-4). K8 was silenced using the small interfering RNA approach. IL-6 significantly up-regulated mRNA and protein levels of K8 and K18. Confocal microscopy showed a reticular pattern of intracellular keratin localized to the subapical region after IL-6 treatment. IL-6 also induced serine phosphorylation of K8. IL-6 decreased paracellular flux of FD-4 compared with vehicle-treated monolayers. K8 silencing abolished the decrease in paracellular permeability induced by IL-6. Administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) significantly increased intestinal permeability in IL-6-/- mice compared with wild type mice given DSS. Collectively, our data demonstrate that IL-6 regulates the colonic expression of K8 and K18, and K8/K18 mediates barrier protection by IL-6 under conditions where intestinal barrier is compromised. Thus, our data uncover a novel function of these abundant cytoskeletal proteins, which may have implications in intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease wherein barrier dysfunction underlies the inflammatory response.

Thus, our data uncover a novel function of these abundant cytoskeletal proteins, which may have implications in intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease wherein barrier dysfunction underlies the inflammatory response. Keratins are a family of structural proteins that form the intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton in epithelial cells (1Coulombe P.A. Omary M.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 110-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 2Moll R. Franke W.W. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1982; 175: 146-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). They are among the most abundant cytoskeletal proteins and constitute up to 5% of total cellular proteins in the intestinal epithelium. At least 49 keratins subtypes have been identified so far (3Hesse M. Magin T.M. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2569-2575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are encoded by a large multigene family whose individual members can be divided into type I (acidic) and type II (neutral and basic) classes on the basis of their sequence. The prototype structure of all intermediate filament proteins, including keratins, consists of a structurally conserved central coiled-coil helix termed the “rod” that is flanked by non-helical N-terminal “head” and C-terminal “tail” domains (4Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Most of the structural heterogeneity of the different keratins resides in their head and tail domains, which also contain all of the known phosphorylation sites (1Coulombe P.A. Omary M.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 110-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 5Omary M.B. Ku N.O. Liao J. Price D. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 105-140PubMed Google Scholar). The type I and type II keratins are regulated in a pair-wise and tissue-specific pattern in epithelial tissues of various types including the intestine (6Omary M.B. Coulombe P.A. McLean W.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 2087-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells express keratin pairs that are assembled as obligate heteropolymers of type I (keratins K9-K20) and type II (K1-K8) keratin (1Coulombe P.A. Omary M.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 110-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 2Moll R. Franke W.W. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1982; 175: 146-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4Herrmann H. Aebi U.

Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4473) Google Scholar). Thus, all epithelial cells express at least one type I and one type II keratin in an overall 1:1 stoichiometry. Each keratin pair has a specific and characteristic tissue distribution pattern. For example, the thick external barrier such as the skin express primarily K1 and K5 (type II) and K10 and K14 (type I), whereas the internal epithelia such as the intestine express principally K8 (type II) and K18 (type I) and with variable levels of K7, K19, and K20 depending on the cell type (1Coulombe P.A. Omary M.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 110-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 8Wald F.A. Oriolo A.S. Casanova M.L. Salas P.J. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 359-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). One clearly delineated function of keratins in many tissues is to protect cells from mechanical and non-mechanical forms of injury (1Coulombe P.A. Omary M.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 110-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 10Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 11Lane E.B. McLean W.H. J. Pathol. 2004; 204: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Impressive progress has been made over the past decade or so in linking at least 14 of the keratins to a number of skin, oral, esophageal, and liver diseases (6Omary M.B. Coulombe P.A. McLean W.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 2087-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 12McLean W.H. Lane E.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, a full appreciation of keratin function in the intestine has been lagging. Recent studies have reported K8 missense mutation in a subset of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. These mutations have been shown to result in incompetent keratin polymerization that may lead to increased epithelial fragility (13Owens D.W. Lane E.B. J. Pathol. 2004; 204: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Owens D.W. Wilson N.J. Hill A.J. Rugg E.L. Porter R.M. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. van Heel D. Parkes M. Jewell D.P.

Based on these observations, K8 might play a pathogenetic role in inflammatory bowel disease. This is substantiated by animal data obtained from K8 or K18 null mice. For example, the phenotype resulting from K8 deletion has demonstrated an important role for keratins in epithelial barrier integrity and inflammation (15Habtezion A. Toivola D.M. Butcher E.C. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1971-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Baribault H. Penner J. Iozzo R.V. Wilson-Heiner M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2964-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). K8 null mice in C57BL/6 background die in utero predominantly due to placental barrier dysfunction mediated by tumor necrosis factor-α (17Jaquemar D. Kupriyanov S. Wankell M. Avis J. Benirschke K. Baribault H. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On the other hand, K8 null mice in FVB/N background survive to adulthood but develop colonic hyperplasia, rectal prolapse, and Th-2-mediated colitis that is amenable to antibiotic treatment (15Habtezion A. Toivola D.M. Butcher E.C. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1971-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which K8 null mice develop barrier dysfunction or colitis is not known, it is hypothesized that the absence of K8 leads to mistargeting of cellular proteins (such as anion-exchanger 1,2), altered susceptibility to injury, and antigen processing culminating in a mucosal inflammatory response (15Habtezion A. Toivola D.M. Butcher E.C. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1971-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Toivola D.M. Krishnan S. Binder H.J. Singh S.K. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This model underscores the importance of intestinal epithelial keratin in injury and inflammation. Loss of barrier function provided by epithelial cells is thought to be the initial inciting event that underlies injury and inflammation in many intestinal disorders including shock, trauma, sepsis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Such barrier defects result in the migration of antigenic material, previously confined to the intestinal lumen, into the submucosa exposing lamina propria immune cells to naiöve antigens eliciting inflammatory response and epithelial injury that characterize these diseases (19Shen L. Turner J.R. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2006; 290: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Dignass A.U. Baumgart D.C. Sturm A. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 20 (Suppl. 4): 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytokines play a central role in regulating epithelial barrier function during inflammation. We have previously shown that interleukin-6 (IL-6) 2The abbreviations used are: IL-6, interleukin-6; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; WT, wild type; DSS, dextran sodium sulfate; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein. 2The abbreviations used are: IL-6, interleukin-6; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; WT, wild type; DSS, dextran sodium sulfate; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein. plays a protective role in epithelial barrier function (21Wang L.X. Kolachala V. Srinivasan S. Merlin D. Sitaraman S.V. Gastroenterology. 2005; 128 (abstr.): 659Google Scholar), in contrast to interferon-γ or tumor necrosis factor-α, which decreases barrier function (22Clayburgh D.R. Shen L. Turner J.R. Lab. Investig. 2004; 84: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). IL-6 is a potent immunoregulatory cytokine with pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. Its expression under physiological conditions is important for the host response to a number of infections, and under pathological states excessive secretion of IL-6 may play a major role in the pathogenesis of many diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (23Atreya R.

In addition to its effect on immune cells, we and others have shown that intestinal epithelial cells are an important source of IL-6 (26Sitaraman S.V. Merlin D. Wang L. Wong M. Gewirtz A.T. Si-Tahar M. Madara J.L. J. Clin.

IL-6 acts on epithelial cells in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to activate the classical STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) signaling pathway as well as the NF-κB signaling pathway (29Wang L.

In this study we addressed the role and regulation of intestinal epithelial keratins, K8 and K18, by IL-6 and IL-6-mediated barrier function alterations. Reagents and Antibodies—All tissue culture supplies were obtained from Invitrogen. Reagents for SDS-PAGE and nitrocellulose membranes were from Bio-Rad. Anti-K18 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, Ca). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (used for confocal microscopy at 1:400 dilution) were a kind gift from Dr. Bishr Omary (31Ku N.O. Toivola D.M. Zhou Q. Tao G.Z. Zhong B. Omary M.B. Methods Cell Biol. 2004; 78: 489-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Anti-K8/18 mouse monoclonal antibody (used for Western blot at 1:1000 dilution) and anti-phospho-K8 Ser-431 and Ser-73 were obtained from Labvision (1:100 dilution), and anti-tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody was from Sigma.

Oligofectamine and Lipofectamine 2000 were from Invitrogen. Human K8 RNAi was from Invitrogen. Recombinant IL-6 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and used at 100 ng/ml, added to the basolateral medium (29Wang L. Walia B. Evans J. Gewirtz A.T. Merlin D. Sitaraman S.V. J.

This dose of IL-6 was chosen based on our previous data with respect to signaling as well as functional responses of IL-6 in Caco2-BBE cells (26Sitaraman S.V. Merlin D. Wang L. Wong M. Gewirtz A.T.

Cell Culture—Caco2-BBE cells were grown as confluent monolayers in Dulbecco’s Vogt modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 40 mg/liter penicillin, 90 mg/liter streptomycin, and 10% newborn calf serum. Confluent stock monolayers were subcultured by trypsinization. Experiments were performed on cells plated for 8–10 days on permeable supports of 0.33 cm2 or 4.5 cm2 inserts (Costar, Cambridge, MA). Inserts (0.4-μm pore size, Costar, Cambridge, MA) rested in wells containing media until steady-state resistance was achieved (29Wang L. Walia B. Evans J. Gewirtz A.T. Merlin D. Sitaraman S.V. J.

Northern Blot—A Northern blot was performed as described previously (29Wang L. Walia B. Evans J. Gewirtz A.T. Merlin D. Sitaraman S.V. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3194-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from cells with Tri-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA (20 μg) was separated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Gene Screen Plus membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After fixation under calibrated UV light, the membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled K8, K18, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA and visualized by autoradiography. The probe for K8 cDNA was generated by RT-PCR using K8 specific primers 5′-atgtccatcagggtgaccca-3′ and 5′-tgttcacttgggcaggacgtcag-3′ (1454-bp product) and ligated into PCR2.1 vector. The sequence was verified by DNA sequencing (Emory DNA Core Facility). HindIII was used to excise the probe. Complementary cDNA clones encoding K18 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). SDS-PAGE, Western Blot, and Immunoprecipitation—For Western blot analysis, colonic tissues were homogenized and extracted with lysis buffer. Samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was used for assays. Keratin-enriched cytoskeletal preparations from Caco2-BBE cells were made as described (33Ridge K.M. Linz L. Flitney F.W. Kuczmarski E.R. Chou Y.H. Omary M.B. Sznajder J.I. Goldman R.D. J. Biol.

Methods Cell Biol. 2004; 78: 3-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Briefly, Triton X-100-soluble or Triton X-100-insoluble fractions were prepared by solubilizing cells for 10 min at 4 °C with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mix (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) followed by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 10 min). The supernatant was collected as the soluble fraction. The pellet was homogenized in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 m KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitor mix. After 30 min (4 °C), the homogenate was pelleted (16,000 × g; 10 min), and the pellet (insoluble fraction) was re-homogenized with 5 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4, and dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol, sonicated, and boiled for 5 min (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205511) Google Scholar). The samples were separated on 7.5 or 10% polyacrylamide gels according to the method of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205511) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with primary antibody (anti K8/18, 1/1000). The membranes were incubated with corresponding peroxidase-linked secondary antibody diluted 1:2000, washed, and subsequently incubated with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) before exposure to high performance chemiluminescence films (Amersham Biosciences). For Mr determination, polyacrylamide gels were calibrated using standard proteins (Bio-Rad) with Mr markers within the range 10–250. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (36Sitaraman S.V.

Briefly, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer. After pelleting (16,000 × g; 15 min), K8 was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using an anti-K8 antibody coupled to protein A/G-Sepharose. The beads were washed once with lysis buffer and twice with PBS (3 mm EDTA). Proteins were solubilized in 3× Laemmli sample buffer and then immunoblotted as described above with the relevant antibodies. Plasmid and Transient Transfection—For RNAi studies, Caco2-BBE cells grown on 0.45 cm2 filters were transfected with K8-specific stealth RNAi duplex oligoribonucleotides (siRNA) (UGGACACCUUGUAGGACUUCUGGGU) for most effective knockdown of K8. Stealth RNAi oligos are a chemically modified blunt-ended 25-bp RNA duplex that elicits the RNAi response in cells. It delivers highly specific, effective knockdown with greater stability compared with unmodified siRNA molecules. Only the antisense strand can participate in RNAi, avoiding unwanted off-target effects, allowing effective knockdown only of the targeted gene. Stealth RNAi chemical modification minimizes the induction of nonspecific cellular stress response pathways. BLOCK-iT Fluorescent Oligo (Invitrogen) as well as scrambled K8 RNAi were used as the control. BLOCK-iT is a fluorescent-labeled, double-stranded RNA duplex with the same length, charge, and configuration as standard siRNA. The sequence of the BLOCK-iT Fluorescent Oligo is not homologous to any known gene, ensuring against induction of nonspecific cellular events caused by introduction of the oligo into cells (38Kim D.H. Behlke M.A. Rose S.D. Chang M.S. Choi S. Rossi J.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with appropriate vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with IL-6, and permeability to FITC dextran (4 kDa) was performed as described below. Total cell lysates were collected for K8 expression. Confocal Microscopy—Monolayers of Caco2-BBE cells were washed in Hanks’ balanced salt solution, fixed in buffered 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, incubated overnight with primary antibody (anti-K8/18 rabbit polyclonal antibody, 1:400) in a humidity chamber, washed with PBS, and subsequently incubated with fluoresceinated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Monolayers were also counterstained with rhodamine-phalloidin to visualize actin. Monolayers mounted in p-phenylenediamine glycerol (1:1) were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Zeiss dual laser confocal microscope; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) as described previously (36Sitaraman S.V.

Using actin staining, the apical-most surface of the cell was marked as 0 μm, and the basolateral surface was marked at the level of actin stress fiber (18.7 μm from the top of the cell). xy sections were taken at 1.2 μm from the top (above the level of tight junction) and at the level of actin stress fiber. Quantitation of confocal images was performed on unprocessed images using Metamorph Imaging System Software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA) as described (36Sitaraman S.V. Wang L. Wong M.

The average grayscale pixel intensity +1 S.D. of a small region was measured and defined as background. To subtract background, the threshold of each channel was set at the value obtained for background. The average pixel intensity +1 S.D. was measured for the threshold images. The data are presented as the mean (±S.E.). Colon tissue from WT and IL-6-/- mice embedded in paraffin or optimal cutting media were obtained as described by Castaneda et al. (39Castaneda F.E.

Sections were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 + 0.08% saponin in PBS at room temperature for 35 min. The sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated with rhodaminephalloidin (1:60) diluted in PBS for 40 min at room temperature. Sections were subsequently blocked with 2% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated with primary antibody, K8/K18 (Chemicon; 15 μg/ml in 2% BSA in PBS solution) or rabbit IgG (Sigma, control) or anti-actin (Sigma; 1:50,000 in 2% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing 3 times with PBS, they were incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad; 1:100 in 2% BSA in PBS solution) or rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Bio-Rad; 1:100 in 2% BSA in PBS solution) for 45 min at room temperature and then mounted with Slow Fade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) mounting medium and examined using Zeiss LSM microscope. Measurement of Macromolecular Permeability—Paracellular permeability was determined by measuring apical to basolateral flux of fluoresceinated dextran (FD-4, Mr 4; Sigma) using a modification of previously described method (40Leonard M. Creed E. Brayden D. Baird A.W. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2000; 17: 1181-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent epithelial monolayers on 0.33-cm2 0.4-μm pore size permeable supports were washed twice with Hanks’ balanced salt solution containing calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate (HBSS+) and maintained at 37 °C on a shaking warm plate. FD-4, 1 mg/ml, was added apically at time 0, and 50-μl samples were removed from the basolateral compartment at 30-min intervals from 0 to 120 min, inclusive. Fluorescence intensity of each sample was measured (excitation, 492 nm; emission, 525 nm; Cytofluor 2300; Millipore Corp., Waters Chromatography, Bedford, MA), and FITC-dextran concentrations were determined from standard curves generated by serial dilution of FITC-dextran. Paracellular flux was calculated by linear regression of sample fluorescence (Excel 5.0, Microsoft WA, Power Macintosh 7200). In vivo permeability assay to assess barrier function was performed using a FITC-labeled dextran method as described (41Furuta G.T. Turner J.R. Taylor C.T. Hershberg R.M. Comerford K. Narravula S. Podolsky D.K. Colgan S.P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6–8-week-old WT and IL-6-/- mice were used. Food and water were withdrawn for 4 h, and mice were gavaged with permeability tracer (60 mg/100 g body weight of FITC-labeled dextran, FD-4, Mr 4000, Sigma). Serum was collected retroorbitally 4 h after FD-4 gavage, and fluorescence intensity of each sample was measured (excitation, 492 nm; emission, 525 nm; Cytofluor 2300; Millipore), and FITC-dextran concentrations were determined from standard curves generated by serial dilution of FITC-dextran. Permeability was calculated by linear regression of sample fluorescence (Excel 5.0, Microsoft Office). Data Analysis—Results were analyzed using Student’s t test. Differences were considered significant at the p < 0.05 level. Experimental Animals—The Animal Care Committee of the Emory University, Atlanta approved all procedures performed on animals and was in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, published by the United States Public Health Service. IL-6-/- mice (C57/B6 background) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. The homozygous IL-6-deficient mice used were the progeny of heterozygous breeding pairs of C57/B6 background with disruption of the IL-6 gene that were backcrossed for more than six generations. These mice developed normally and were fertile. Age- and sex-matched WT and IL-6-/- littermates used in the study were between 6 and 8 weeks old at the beginning of the experimental protocol and were maintained under conditions as described previously (39Castaneda F.E. Walia B. Vijay-Kumar M. Patel N.R. Roser S. Kolachala V.L. Rojas M. Wang L. Oprea G. Garg P. Gewirtz A.T. Roman J. Merlin D. Sitaraman S.V.

Mice were given DSS (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) at 3% (w/v) in tap water ad libitum for 4 days. Age-matched male and female wild type and IL-6-/- littermates receiving tap water served as controls. Mice were observed daily and evaluated for changes in body weight. IL-6 Increases the Expression of K8/K18—To determine whether IL-6 modulates keratin expression, Caco2-BBE cells grown in tissue culture inserts were stimulated via the basal surface with IL-6 (100 ng/ml). Cells were lysed at various times after IL-6 stimulation, and mRNA and protein expression of K8/K18 was determined by Northern blot and Western blot, respectively, as described under “Materials and Methods.” As seen in Fig. 1A, a small amount of K8 mRNA was detected at base line. However, K8 mRNA was significantly increased at 2 h and was maximal at 4 h. Similar results were"

Although it is becoming increasingly clear that modulation of actin is critical for spine dynamics, the upstream molecular signals that regulate the formation and plasticity of spines are poorly understood. In non-neuronal cells, integrins are critical modulators of the actin cytoskeleton, but their function in the nervous system is not well characterized. Here we show that α5 integrin regulates spine morphogenesis and synapse formation in hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of α5 integrin expression using small interfering RNA decreased the number of dendritic protrusions, spines, and synapses. Expression of constitutively active or dominant negative α5 integrin also resulted in alterations in the number of dendritic protrusions, spines, and synapses. α5 integrin signaling regulates spine morphogenesis and synapse formation by a mechanism that is dependent on Src kinase, Rac, and the signaling adaptor GIT1. Alterations in the activity or localization of these molecules result in a significant decrease in the number of spines and synapses. Thus, our results point to a critical role for integrin signaling in regulating the formation of dendritic spines and synapses in hippocampal neurons.

Alterations in the activity or localization of these molecules result in a significant decrease in the number of spines and synapses. Thus, our results point to a critical role for integrin signaling in regulating the formation of dendritic spines and synapses in hippocampal neurons. Integrins are heterodimeric, transmembrane cell surface receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Integrin cytoplasmic domains bind to signaling molecules and other components of the actin cytoskeleton and provide a functional link between the extracellular environment and the interior of the cell. In this way, integrins can initiate and regulate several different signal transduction pathways in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. A modest, emerging literature implicates integrins in learning and memory in both invertebrate and vertebrate species. A mutation in a synapse-associated integrin α subunit (vol) in Drosophila impairs short term memory processes (1Grotewiel M.S. Beck C.D.O. Wu K.H. Zhu X.-R. Davis R.L. Nature. 1998; 391: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Mice with reduced expression of the α3, α5, or α8 integrins are defective in hippocampal long term potentiation and spatial memory (2Chan C.S. Weeber E.J. Kurup S. Sweatt J.D. Davis R.L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7107-7116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, function-blocking antibodies against the α5 integrin significantly reduce long term potentiation stabilization in the rat hippocampus (3Chun D. Gall C. Bi X. Lynch G. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that integrins regulate some processes underlying memory formation; however, the mechanism by which integrins do this remains unknown. A number of studies associate changes in the number, size, and shape of dendritic spines with synaptic plasticity, which underlies learning and memory, and with neurological disorders, such as mental retardation, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer disease (4Engert F.

Dendritic spines are small, actin-rich protrusions that function as bridges between axons and dendrites and serve as sites of post-synaptic contact and signal integration for most of the excitatory synapses in the central nervous system (8Gray E.G.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 847-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 11Matus A. Science. 2000; 290: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 12Dunaevsky A. Tashiro A. Majewska A. Mason C. Yuste R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13438-13443Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). This actin-based dynamic behavior of spines is proposed to maximize the likelihood of connecting with presynaptic axons, although the function of spine motility may not be limited to the initial contact and could serve additional roles, such as altering signaling processes after synapses have formed (13Dunaevsky A. Mason C.A. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 155-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although it is becoming increasingly clear that modulation of actin is critical for spine motility, the upstream molecular signals that regulate the formation and plasticity of spines are poorly understood. In this study, we show that α5 integrin regulates spine morphogenesis and synapse formation in hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of endogenous α5 integrin expression using small interfering RNA (siRNA) 2The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DN, dominant negative; KD, kinase-defective. 2The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DN, dominant negative; KD, kinase-defective. decreased the number of dendritic protrusions, spines, and synapses. Expression of an α5 integrin, which has a F1025A mutation that locks the integrin in a constitutive signaling state, results in the formation of multiple dendritic protrusions and a decrease in the number of spines and synapses. Expression of an α5 mutant deficient in integrin signaling produces smooth dendrites with a reduction in the number of protrusions, spines, and synapses. α5 integrin signaling regulates spine morphogenesis and synapse formation by a mechanism that is dependent on Src kinase, Rac, and the signaling adaptor GIT1. Alterations in the activity or localization of these molecules result in a significant decrease in the number of spines and synapses. Thus, our results reveal an important function for integrin signaling in regulating the formation of spines and synapses and identify molecules that are critical for these processes. Reagents and Plasmids—The synaptic vesicle protein SV2 monoclonal antibody was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) and used at a 1:100 dilution for immunostaining. α5 integrin polyclonal antibody clone 1928 (1:100) was from Chemicon, and GIT1 polyclonal antibody (1:100) was previously described (14Manabe R. Kovalenko M. Webb D.J. Horwitz A.R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1497-1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α5 siRNAs were prepared by annealing 75 base pair sense and antisense oligos, which contained the following 19 nucleotides from the rat α5 integrin sequence: 5′-GGCATGCGCTCCACTGTAT-3′ or 5′-CACTAGCCAACCAGGAGTA-3′. The annealed oligos were then subcloned into pSUPER at the BglII and HindIII sites as previously described (15Zhang H. Webb D.J. Asmussen H. Niu S. Horwitz A.F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3379-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The GIT1 siRNA has been previously described (15Zhang H. Webb D.J. Asmussen H. Niu S. Horwitz A.F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3379-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Human α5 integrin-GFP was prepared as previously described (16Laukaitis C.M. Webb D.J. Donais K. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1427-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Kinase-active Src (CA-Src) and kinase-defective (KD)-Src were a generous gift from Sally Parsons. CA-Src, which has a tyrosine→phenylalanine substitution at amino acid 527, has been previously described (17Wang K. Hackett J.T. Cox M.E. Van Hoek M. Lindstrom J.M. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8779-8786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). KD-Src has an alanine→valine substitution at residue 430, which renders it deficient in kinase activity and inhibits the phosphorylation of c-Src substrates when overexpressed in cultured cells (18Chang J.H. Settleman J. Parsons S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged constitutively active Rac (RacV12) and dominant negative Rac (RacN17) were kindly provided by Alan Hall. Neuronal Cultures and Transfections—Hippocampal neurons were isolated from embryonic day 19 rat embryos as previously described (19Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Culturing Nerve Cells.2nd Ed. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar). Neurons were plated at an approximate density of 70 cells/mm2 on glass coverslips coated with 1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine and were transfected by a modified calcium phosphate method as previously described (20Zhang H. Webb D.J. Asmussen H. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Immunostaining—Neurons were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Nonspecific absorption was blocked by incubating the coverslips with 20% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then incubated with the indicated antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% goat serum and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Image Analysis—Images were acquired using an Orca II charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan) attached to an inverted Nikon TE-300 microscope using a 60× objective (numerical aperture = 1.4). Image acquisition was controlled using either iSee (Inovision, Raleigh, NC) or MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA). The linear density of dendritic protrusions, spines, and synapses were quantified using NIH Image Software. α5 Integrin Regulates Spine Morphology and Synapse Formation—Our working hypothesis is that integrin signaling, specifically α5 integrin, contributes to learning and memory by regulating spine morphology and synapse formation through modulation of the actin cytoskeleton. To test this, we first developed a siRNA reagent to knockdown expression of endogenous α5 integrin in mammalian cells. As determined by immunoblot analysis with rat2 fibroblasts, the siRNA decreased expression of endogenous α5 integrin by almost 90% but had no detectable effect on the expression of β1 integrin, indicating its specificity for α5 (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the siRNA was very effective in decreasing expression of α5 integrin expression in hippocampal neurons. When neurons were transfected with α5 integrin siRNA or pSUPER empty vector as a control, the α5 siRNA reduced the expression of endogenous α5 integrin by >85% (Fig. 1B). In α5 siRNA-expressing neurons, the number of spines and dendritic protrusions decreased significantly as compared with controls (Fig. 1, C and D). In addition, the number of synapses in the α5 siRNA-expressing neurons decreased by 80% as determined by SV2 immunostaining (Fig. 1, C and D). To show that the effects of α5 siRNA were due to the loss of endogenous α5 integrin expression, human α5-GFP was co-expressed with α5 siRNA. The α5 siRNA is specific for the rat sequence and has no effect on the expression of human α5 integrin. Expression of human α5 rescued the defects in the siRNA-expressing neurons (Fig. 1D). These results show that the defects in spine morphogenesis and synapse formation are due to the loss of endogenous α5 integrin and point to a critical function for this integrin in the regulation of spine and synapse formation. We then asked whether α5 integrin localizes to synapses in hippocampal neurons. Although we detected α5 integrin in a few synapses, the overall distribution was relatively diffuse (Fig. 2A). However, in response to synaptic stimulation with glutamate, the localization of α5 integrin to synapses increased 4-fold (Fig. 2A). These observations support and extend previous studies that showed high expression of α5 integrin in pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and in hippocampal synapses (21Bi X. Lynch G. Zhou J. Gall C.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 435: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Bahr B.A. Lynch G. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that activity-induced changes at synapses promote α5 targeting to these sites, which is consistent with α5 signaling playing a regulatory role in synaptic function. To show that activation of integrin signaling pathways modulates spine morphology, we generated a constitutively active α5 (CA-α5) mutant, which locks the integrin in an activated state and turns on integrin signaling pathways. Previous studies have shown that a point mutation in the cytoplasmic tail of αIIbβ3, which converts the GFFKR sequence to GAFKR, results in constitutive activation of the integrin (23Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). This constitutively activated αIIbβ3 phosphorylates focal adhesion kinase when cells are in suspension and localizes to adhesions independently of ligand binding, indicating that integrin signaling pathways are activated. Our CA-α5 mutant, which has a F1025A mutation that converts GFFKR to GAFKR, phosphorylates focal adhesion kinase and paxillin when cells are in suspension, confirming that the integrin is in an activated state. Neurons expressing CA-α5-GFP formed multiple dendritic protrusions with a significant decrease in the number of spines (Fig. 2, B and C). The number of synapses decreased by almost 80% in neurons expressing CA-α5-GFP compared with control cells (Fig. 2, B and C). We next used an α5 mutant that has previously been shown to be deficient in integrin signaling (24Cao Z. Huang K. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31670-31679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This α5 mutant significantly decreased the adhesion, spreading, and migration of epithelial cells (24Cao Z. Huang K. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31670-31679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, epithelial cells expressing the α5 mutant showed significantly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibited focal adhesion assembly (24Cao Z. Huang K. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31670-31679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, the α5 mutant functions as a dominant negative (DN) and impairs integrin-mediated signaling. Neurons expressing the dominant negative α5 mutant fused to GFP (DN-α5-GFP) exhibited smooth dendrites with a dramatic reduction in the number of spines and synapses when compared with the control neurons (Fig. 2, B and C). Taken together, our results show that α5 integrin-mediated signaling regulates spine morphogenesis and synapse formation in hippocampal neurons. Src Kinase, an Integrin Effector, Regulates Spine Morphology and Synapse Formation—In non-neuronal cells, integrin engagement has been shown to regulate actin dynamics through a signaling pathway that contains both Src family protein tyrosine kinases and Rac (25del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 26Shattil S.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 399-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This raises the interesting question as to whether integrin signaling regulates spine morphology and synapse formation through a similar mechanism. Expression of CA-Src resulted in the formation of multiple dendritic protrusions with a dramatic decrease in the number of spines and synapses (Fig. 3, A and B). By contrast, neurons expressing Src with a point mutation at residue 430 (Ala→ Val), which renders it deficient in kinase activity (KD-Src), exhibited smooth dendrites with a decrease in the number of dendritic protrusions (Fig. 3, A and B). These neurons also had significantly fewer spines and synapses than control cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The phenotypic changes observed in neurons expressing CA-Src and KD-Src are reminiscent of those seen in CA-α5- and DN-α5-expressing neurons, suggesting a role for Src in mediating integrin signaling. If the dendritic protrusions induced by CA-α5 integrin are mediated through Src, then inhibiting Src activity should block the formation of these protrusions. Consistent with this, expression of KD-Src with CA-α5 inhibited the formation of the dendritic protrusions that are typically observed with CA-α5 alone (Fig. 3, C and D). In addition, if Src is an effector of integrin signaling, expression of CA-Src with α5 siRNA should reverse the α5 siRNA-induced phenotype. Expression of CA-Src with α5 siRNA produced multiple protrusions along the dendrites as opposed to the smooth dendrites observed in neurons expressing α5 siRNA alone (Fig. 3, C and D). Taken together, these results suggest that Src is necessary for the integrin-mediated regulation of spine morphology and synapse formation in hippocampal neurons. α5 Integrin Regulates Spine Morphogenesis through a Rac-dependent Mechanism—We next addressed the role of Rac in the regulation of spine morphology and synapse formation by integrins. We have previously shown that expression of dominant negative Rac (DN-Rac) produced smooth dendrites with a reduction in the number of spines and synapses (20Zhang H. Webb D.J. Asmussen H. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Expression of dominant negative α5 integrin (DN-α5) produced a very similar phenotype (Fig. 4, A and B). By contrast, CA-α5-expressing neurons formed numerous long, thin dendritic protrusions, which are analogous to those seen in neurons expressing constitutively active Rac (CA-Rac) (Fig. 4, A and B). If the CA-α5-induced dendritic protrusions are mediated through Rac, then inhibiting Rac activity should block their formation. Expression of DN-Rac with CA-α5 blocked the formation of the long, thin dendritic protrusions and produced smooth dendrites with very few spines (Fig. 4, C and D). If integrins are signaling through Rac, then expression of CA-Rac should also rescue the α5 siRNA-induced phenotype and result in the formation of multiple dendritic protrusions. As anticipated, neurons expressing CA-Rac and α5 siRNA exhibited numerous protrusions along the dendrites (Fig. 4, C and D). Our results suggest that integrin signaling regulates spine morphology and synapse formation in the neurons through modulation of Rac activity. Expression of the Signaling Adaptor GIT1 Is Required for the α5 Integrin-mediated Effects on Spine Morphology—We have previously shown that the signaling adaptor GIT1 regulates spine morphogenesis and synapse formation by organizing a Rac signaling module that locally modulates Rac activity at synapses (20Zhang H. Webb D.J. Asmussen H. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To determine whether the α5 integrin-mediated effects on spine morphogenesis are GIT1 dependent, we transfected neurons with CA-α5 and GIT1 siRNA. As expected, neurons expressing CA-α5 alone exhibited numerous dendritic protrusions (Fig. 5, A and B). However, expression of GIT1 siRNA with CA-α5 blocked the formation of these dendritic protrusions and produced smooth dendrites with very few spines, suggesting that the integrin-induced effects on spine morphology are mediated through GIT1 (Fig. 5, A and B). We then asked whether the increase in α5 integrin localization to synapses is accompanied by a parallel activity-dependent change in GIT1 localization. In neurons stimulated with glutamate, we observed a 3-fold increase in the localization of GIT1 to synapses (Fig. 5C). This shows that, as with α5 integrin, synaptic stimulation increases the targeting of GIT1 to synapses. Taken together, our results suggest a molecular mechanism by which integrin signaling regulates the formation of spines and synapses and provides an explanation, at least in part, for the role of integrins in cognitive processes. Integrins, which are transmembrane receptors, are poised to transmit extracellular cues to the interior of cells. How signals are initiated through these receptors in the dendritic spines is unknown. One possibility is that they are initiated by an unknown ligand, as the synapse is not reported to be rich in fibronectin. It is also possible that integrins are acting in conjugation with other receptors at the membrane, such as neurotransmitter receptors. β integrin-induced actin reorganization in hippocampal neurons is dependent on the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (27Shi Y. Ethell I.M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In hippocampal slices, the rapid outgrowth of the long, thin dendritic protrusions, which are induced by synaptic stimulation in a glutamate receptor-dependent manner (5Maletic-Savatic M. Malinow R. Svoboda K. Science. 1999; 283: 1923-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar), is reminiscent of the phenotype that we observe when integrin-signaling pathways are activated. In non-neuronal cells, integrin-signaling pathways and growth factor receptors function coordinately to control cell behavior (28Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6687) Google Scholar, 29Sastry S.K. Horwitz A.F. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but whether integrin signaling functions in coordination with neurotransmitter receptors to regulate spine morphology is an avenue for future studies. Our results point to a model in which synaptic stimulation induces the targeting of integrin signaling complexes, which include integrins, Src, and GIT1 to dendritic spines and synapses. GIT1 recruits other molecules, including the Rac activator PIX and the Rac effector PAK, to synapses (15Zhang H. Webb D.J. Asmussen H. Niu S. Horwitz A.F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3379-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 20Zhang H. Webb D.J. Asmussen H. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Once assembled, these signaling complexes modulate the formation of spines and synapses by regulating reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The locally regulated activation of Rac, which is a key modulator of actin dynamics, is critical for spine morphogenesis and synapse formation. Mislocalized Rac activity leads to the formation of multiple dendritic protrusions, which are due to aberrant actin organization and an inhibition of synapse formation. Interestingly, this abnormality is a pathology seen in mental retardation (6Fiala J.C. Spacek J. Harris K.M. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2002; 39: 29-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), and three of the seven recently discovered genes mutated in non-syndromic mental retardation, including αPIX and PAK3, are actin regulators (30Allen K.M. Gleeson J.G. Bagrodia S. Partington M.W. MacMillan J.C. Cerione R.A. Mulley J.C. Walsh C.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 31Bienvenu T. des Portes V.

Genet. 2000; 93: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although it is not presently known whether integrins target the GIT1 complexes to synapses, it is interesting to point out that, in non-neuronal cells, integrin signaling through Src promotes the phosphorylation of GIT1 (32Bagrodia S. Bailey D. Lenard Z. Hart M. Guan J.L. Premont R.T. Taylor S.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22393-22400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The majority of the phosphorylation sites detected in GIT1 are found within the domain that localizes it to synapses (33Webb D.J. Mayhew M.W. Kovalenko M. Schroeder M. Jeffery E.D. Whitmore L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Alan Horwitz F. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2847-2850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that phosphorylation in this region could serve a regulatory function. In summary, we have shown that α5 integrin signaling mediates the formation of dendritic spines and synapses in a Src/GIT1/Rac-dependent manner. Alterations in this pathway lead to a significant decrease in the number of spines and synapses, indicating the importance of integrin signaling in spine and synapse formation.

https://openalex.org/W2097041188,"Abstract RSK2, an ERK downstream kinase, is a novel mediator of skeletal muscle cell differentiation through its regulation of NFAT3 activity. We found that the N-terminal (amino acids (aa) 1-68) and C-terminal (aa 416-674) kinase domains of RSK2 directly interacted with nuclear localization signal 1, the Ser/Pro repeat, and the polyproline domains (aa 261-365) of NFAT3. Upon A23187 stimulation, RSK2 induced nuclear localization of NFAT3. RSK2 phosphorylated NFAT3 in vitro (Km = 3.559 μm), and activation of NFAT3 by RSK2 enhanced the promoter activity of NFAT3 downstream target genes in vivo. Furthermore, nuclear accumulation of NFAT3 was attenuated markedly in RSK2-/- cells compared with wild-type RSK2+/+ cells. Notably, RSK2 and NFAT3 induced a significant differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts to multinucleated myotubes. Multinucleated myotube differentiation was inhibited by small interfering RNA against RSK2, ERK1/2, or NFAT3. These results demonstrate that RSK2 is an important kinase for NFAT3 in mediating myotube differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2054416416,"The Akt pathway is commonly deregulated in many cancers. Clinical trials are currently underway to test the effectiveness of breast cancer treatment by inhibition of various Akt pathway intermediates. A set of genes induced by Akt in a transgenic mouse model, a subset of which were sensitive to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor RAD001, was examined in five public gene expression profile data sets of clinical breast tumor specimens (representing >1000 different samples in all). In each of the clinical data sets, the Akt mouse model genes as a group were significantly overexpressed in human tumors having high levels of AKT1 mRNA. The subset of genes both upregulated by Akt and dependent on mTOR activity were associated with estrogen receptor-negative status, higher grade, increasing tumor size and poor prognosis in multiple patient cohorts; these associations were either not present or not as strong for the Akt-induced, mTOR-independent genes or for AKT1 expression alone. The genes shown here to be relevant to Akt-mTOR both experimentally and pathologically have the potential for use in a molecular diagnostic to determine which patients should receive mTOR antagonist treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2134727883,"Adaphostin is a dihydroquinone derivative that is undergoing extensive preclinical testing as a potential anticancer drug. Previous studies have suggested that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a critical role in the cytotoxicity of this agent. In this study, we investigated the source of these ROS. Consistent with the known chemical properties of dihydroquinones, adaphostin simultaneously underwent oxidation to the corresponding quinone and generated ROS under aqueous conditions. Interestingly, however, this quinone was not detected in intact cells. Instead, high performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that adaphostin was concentrated by up to 300-fold in cells relative to the extracellular medium and that the highest concentration of adaphostin (3000-fold over extracellular concentrations) was detected in mitochondria. Consistent with a mitochondrial site for adaphostin action, adaphostin-induced ROS production was diminished by >75% in MOLT-4 rho0 cells, which lack mitochondrial electron transport, relative to parental MOLT-4 cells. In addition, inhibition of oxygen consumption was observed when intact cells were treated with adaphostin. Loading of isolated mitochondria to equivalent adaphostin concentrations caused inhibition of uncoupled oxygen consumption in mitochondria incubated with the complex I substrates pyruvate and malate or the complex II substrate succinate. Further analysis demonstrated that adaphostin had no effect on pyruvate or succinate dehydrogenase activity. Instead, adaphostin inhibited reduced decylubiquinone-induced cytochrome c reduction, identifying complex III as the site of inhibition by this agent. Moreover, adaphostin enhanced the production of ROS by succinate-charged mitochondria. Collectively, these observations demonstrate that mitochondrial respiration rather than direct redox cycling of the hydroquinone moiety is a source of adaphostin-induced ROS and identify complex III as a potential target for antineoplastic agents.

Evidence in support of this view includes increased oxidation of the dyes 5(6)-chloromethyldihydro-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (CM-H2DCF) and dihydroethidium in adaphostin-treated cells, including Bcr/Abl-negative ML-1 and Jurkat cells, as well as the ability of the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (CysNAc), tiron, and Trolox to inhibit the cytotoxicity of adaphostin (4Chandra J. Hackbarth J. Le S. Loegering D. Bone N. Bruzek L.M. Narayanan V.L. Kay N.E. Tefferi A. Karp J.E. Sausville E.A. Kaufmann S.H.

On the other hand, it has also been recognized that dyes such as 5(6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (CM-DCF) are subject to efflux by drug-sensitive transporters (7Laupeze B. Amiot L.

Bernstein I.D. Linenberger M.L. Blood. 2003; 102: 1466-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), raising some doubt regarding the role of ROS in adaphostin cytotoxicity. In biological systems, quinones are known to undergo enzymatic reduction to semiquinone radicals, which then spontaneously oxidize back to quinones, generating superoxide anion in the process (9Powis G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 6: 63-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 10Cadenas E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 11Beall H.D.

These prior observations have led to a general assumption that adaphostin might be rapidly oxidized either extracellularly or intracellularly to a quinone derivative, which could then generate ROS through redox cycling. Direct observations testing this hypothesis have not been reported, however. Moreover, the possibility that leakage of electrons from the mitochondrial electron transport chain, another common source of ROS (13Dawson T.L. Gores G.J. Nieminen A.L. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C961-C967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Turrens J.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 335-344Crossref Scopus (3610) Google Scholar, 15Balaban R.S. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Cell. 2005; 120: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3311) Google Scholar), might contribute to the efficacy of adaphostin has not been examined previously. In this study, we confirmed that adaphostin induces oxidative damage of DNA in intact cells and then followed the fate of adaphostin in solution and in intact cells. The results of this analysis demonstrate that adaphostin is concentrated several thousandfold in mitochondria, where it inhibits complex III of the respiratory chain and leads to mitochondrial ROS generation. These observations not only provide new insight into the mechanism of action of a promising anti-leukemic agent, but also provide additional support for the view that certain inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration might be potential anticancer agents. Reagents—Adaphostin (NSC680410) and its quinone derivative were synthesized by the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Reagents were purchased from the following suppliers: H2O2, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, rotenone, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), pyruvate, sodium succinate, CysNAc, ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxyanisole, p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet, phenazine methosulfate, decylubiquinone, bovine heart cytochrome c, carnitine, NAD+, thiamine pyrophosphate, CoA, bongkrekic acid, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, uridine, and catalase from Sigma; buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) from Chemical Dynamics, Inc.

All components for manufacturing a tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+)-selective membrane, including polyvinyl chloride, TPP sodium salt, and tetrahydrofuran, were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). 2-[14C]Thymidine (59 mCi/mmol) was from ICN (Irvine, CA). Tissue Culture—K562 human leukemia cells and A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. HCT116 human colon cancer cells and OVCAR5 human ovarian cancer cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. The MOLT-4 human acute lymphocytic leukemia cell line and its rho0 derivative, which was generated as described previously (16Holmuhamedov E.L. Jahangir A. Bienengraeeber M. Lewis L.D. Terzic A. Mitochondrion. 2003; 3: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), were grown in the same medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml uridine and 100 μg/ml sodium pyruvate. To assess cell volume, photos of cells were taken using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M optical morphology microscope. The images were captured with a Zeiss Axiocam high resolution digital camera controlled with Zeiss KS400 software, which was used to measure the diameters of at least 80–100 individual cells from each line. The volumes of the cells were derived from the mean diameters and used in calculations to determine adaphostin whole cell uptake. Colony-forming assays, which were performed as described previously (17Kaufmann S.H. Peereboom D. Buckwalter C.A. Svingen P.A. Donehower R.C. Rowinsky E.K. J. Natl.

Chem. 2004; 279: 18641-18647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), were utilized to determine the effects of adaphostin on long-term viability of adherent cell lines. In brief, aliquots containing 350–500 cells were plated in replicate 35- or 60-mm tissue culture plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then treated with the indicated concentrations of BSO or CysNAc for 4 h, at which time adaphostin was added (without removal of BSO or CysNAc) for 24 h. At completion of the incubation, cells were washed, incubated for 7–8 days, stained with Coomassie Blue, and manually examined for colony formation. Diluent-treated plates typically contained 150–250 colonies. Assessment of Intracellular ROS—CM-H2DCF diacetate (a cell-permeant non-fluorescent compound that diffuses into cells, undergoes de-esterification, and is oxidized to the fluorescent dye CM-DCF) was used to assess changes in relative intracellular ROS levels. After exposure to drugs for the indicated times, cells were collected by centrifugation, incubated with 10 μm CM-H2DCF diacetate in calcium- and magnesium-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) for 30 min in the dark at 37 °C, washed with DPBS, read on the FL1 channel of a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur, and analyzed using BD Biosciences CellQuest software. Measurement of Adaphostin-mediated Superoxide and Peroxide Generation in Vitro—Superoxide radical generation was assessed using a cytochrome c reduction assay (19Okubo T. Nagai F. Ushiyama K. Kano I. Toxicol. Lett. 1997; 90: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was initiated by the addition of adaphostin or diluent to a 1-ml mixture containing 50 μm oxidized cytochrome c and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in the absence or presence of 30 μg/ml bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase. The level of superoxide generation was estimated from the difference in absorbance at 550 and 418 nm, which was measured after 1 h of incubation at 21 °C. Generation of H2O2 in solution was assessed using an Amplex Red assay, which monitors peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of Amplex Red to resorufin (20Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar), as described by the supplier. Known concentrations of H2O2 provided a standard curve. Alkaline Elution with Formamidopyrimidine-DNA Glycosylase (Adapted from Refs. 21Pflaum M. Will O. Epe B.

McCormick D.J. Earnshaw W.C. Kaufmann S.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 4283-4296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)—Logarithmically growing cells were labeled for 24 h with 1 μm [14C]thymidine, sedimented, and incubated for 1–2 h at 37 °C in fresh culture medium. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with the indicated concentrations of adaphostin, H2O2, or vehicle, cells (∼200,000/aliquot) were deposited on Nucleopore phosphocellulose filters (1-μm pore size; VWR Scientific Products, Minneapolis, MN) by gentle suction. Cells were washed with 20 ml of icecold pre-lysis buffer (0.075 m NaCl and 0.024 m Na4EDTA (pH 7.4)) and lysed by allowing 5 ml of buffer A (2% (w/v) SDS, 100 mm glycine, and 25 mm EDTA (pH 10)) to drip through the filters over 30 min. After the filters were washed with 25 ml of buffer B (40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 0.1 m KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), 2 ml of buffer B containing 8 units/ml formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase was added to each filter, which was then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and washed with an additional 25 ml of buffer B. Prior to elution, 5 ml of buffer A with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K was allowed to drip through the filter over 30 min. Filters were then washed with 20 mm EDTA (pH 10), and DNA was eluted with 20 mm EDTA (adjusted to pH 12.1 with tetrapropylammonium hydroxide). The distribution of radiolabel in the eluate, the tubing of the elution apparatus, and the filter was analyzed as described by Covey et al. (23Covey J.M. Jaxel C. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5016-5022PubMed Google Scholar). Cells that received 150–900 centigrays of γ-irradiation from a 137Cs source were included in each experiment to provide a standard curve. Analysis of Adaphostin Degradation in DPBS—Adaphostin was added to DPBS and incubated as indicated below. Aliquots were injected onto a Beckman System Gold HPLC system and separated on a Beckman Ultrasphere ODS 5-μm column (4 mm × 25 cm) by isocratic elution with a mobile phase consisting of 1:1 acetonitrile and 2.5 mm ammonium formate (pH 4). Elution was monitored by absorbance at 305 nm. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) Analysis—The LC/MS system consisted of a Shimadzu HPLC system containing two LC-10ADvp pumps and an SIL-10ADvp autoinjector (injection volume of 60 μl) coupled to a Quattro micro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Separation was performed using a Brownlee NewGuard RP-18 7-μm pre-column (15 × 3.2 mm; Chrom Tech, Apple Valley, MN) and a Genesis Lightning C18 120A 4-μm analytical column (10 cm × 2.1 mm; Jones Chromatography, Lakewood, CO). The mobile phase (flow rate of 0.20 ml/min) consisted of acetonitrile and 0.625 mm formate buffer (pH 4), initially at a 40:60 (v/v) ratio for 40 min and then ramped to 60% acetonitrile and held for 10 min. Ionizations of adaphostin and the quinone of adaphostin were accomplished using an electrospray ionization probe operating in positive mode. Detection was accomplished by MS/MS using a daughter ion spectrum scan (m/z 45–450), looking for daughters of the specific parent ions at m/z 394 and 392 for adaphostin and the quinone, respectively. The scan time, cone voltage, and collision energy values were, 1.0 s, 30 V, and 15 eV, respectively. The source temperature, desolvation temperature, cone gas flow, and desolvation gas flow were 100 °C, 120 °C, 100 liters/h, and 250 liters/h, respectively. LC-MS/MS data were collected from 5 to 55 min after sample injection. Spectra and chromatograms were processed using Micromass MassLynx Version 3.5 software. Cell Fractionation and Isolation of Mitochondria from K562 Cells (Adapted from Ref. 24Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar)—All steps were performed at 4 °C. K562 cells (∼108) were harvested by centrifugation at 100 × g for 5 min, washed twice with ice-cold DPBS, and resuspended in 5 ml of buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 3 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm α-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 250 mm sucrose). After 20 min on ice, cells were homogenized in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer until lysed (50 strokes). After the homogenate was sedimented at 800 × g, the pellet containing unbroken cells and nuclei was discarded, and the supernatant was sedimented at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain the mitochondrial fraction, which was resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold buffer C and placed on ice for 15–30 min until used. The post-mitochondrial supernatant was sedimented at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate the microsomal fraction (pellet) from the cytosol (supernatant). Alternatively, rat liver mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation as described (25Qian T. Nieminen A.L. Herman B. Lemaster J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1783-C1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Le S.B. Holmuhamedov E.L. Narayanan V.L. Sausville E.A. Kaufmann S.H. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Measurement of Adaphostin Content in Cellular Fractions— After 6 volumes of acetonitrile was added to 1 volume of each subcellular fraction, samples were mixed thoroughly and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was subjected to HPLC as described above with known concentrations of adaphostin as a standard. The pellet was hydrolyzed in 0.5 m NaOH and assayed for protein. Measurement of ΔΨm of Isolated Mitochondria Using a TPP+-selective Electrode—The membrane potential and respiration of isolated mitochondria were recorded using a prototype multichannel recorder (ABMT-USA, Inc., Durham, NC). ΔΨm was measured in incubation medium containing 200 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 5 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm pyruvate, 5 mm malate, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.35) using a home-made TPP+-sensitive mini-electrode as described (27Holmuhamedov E.L. Wang L. Terzic A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 347-360Crossref Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria (1 mg/ml protein) were added to the incubation medium containing 500 μm TPP chloride. ΔΨ was calculated from the TPP+ electrode reading according to the following equation: ΔΨ = 59 log(ν/V) - 59 log(10(E-E0)/59 - 1), where ΔΨ is the mitochondrial membrane potential (in millivolts); ν is the mitochondrial matrix volume (1.6 μl/mg of mitochondrial protein) (28Petronilli V. Pietrobon D. Zoratti M. Azzone G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 155: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); V is the volume of the incubation medium (1 ml); and E0 and E are electrode potentials (in millivolts) before and after the addition of mitochondria, respectively (29Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Adaphostin up to 25 μm and vehicle (Me2SO) up to 0.5% (v/v) did not interfere with the readings of the TPP+-sensitive electrode. Only electrodes that exhibited a Nernstian response were used. Oxygen Consumption—Mitochondria were suspended at a concentration of 1 mg/ml protein in mitochondrial incubation buffer (MIB) consisting of 200 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 5 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.35). K562 cells were suspended in cell culture medium at a concentration of 107 cells/ml. Oxygen consumption was measured using a Clark-type electrode (Model 5300, YSI Inc.). All measurements were performed at room temperature. Dehydrogenase Assays—Succinate dehydrogenase activity was assayed as described (30Porteous J.W. Clark B. Biochem. J. 1965; 96: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria (1 mg of protein) were suspended in 1 ml of reaction buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 50 mm sodium succinate, 25 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (w/v) p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet and incubated on ice for 30 min. Following the addition of adaphostin, the suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. After the reaction was terminated with 1 ml of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, the product was extracted into 4 ml of ethyl acetate and assayed at 490 nm. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was measured as described by Schwab et al. (31Schwab M.A. Kolker S. van den Heuvel L.P. Sauer S. Wolf N.I. Rating D. Hoffmann G.F. Smeitink J.A. Okun J.G. Clin. Chem. 2005; 51: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria (4 mg/ml protein) were suspended in buffer consisting of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). After three freeze-thaw cycles, mitochondria were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to activate pyruvate dehydrogenase. Aliquots of the mitochondrial suspension (50 μl) were added to the wells of a microtiter plate, and the reaction was started by the addition of 250 μl of reaction buffer containing 5 mml-carnitine, 2.5 mm NAD+, 0.2 mm thiamine pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm CoA, 5 mm pyruvate, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.6 mm p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet, and 6.5 μm phenazine methosulfate in 0.05 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). Activity was estimated from the changes in absorbance (A500 - A700). Complex III Activity Measurement—Complex III activity was assessed by monitoring the reduction in cytochrome c measured as changes in absorbance (A550 - A540) in the presence of reduced decylubiquinone (32Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To synthesize reduced decylubiquinone, a small crystal of sodium borohydride was added to 200 μl of 10 mm decylubiquinone (oxidized form). 5 μlof0.1 m HCl was added, and the reaction was mixed until the yellow solution became colorless. The reduced decylubiquinone (supernatant) was transferred to a fresh tube, diluted with 5 ml of 1 m HCl, and stored in the dark until used. To assay complex III activity, mitochondria (30 μg/ml protein) were resuspended in reaction buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 μm cytochrome c, and 2 mm KCN at 21 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μm reduced decylubiquinone, and complex III activity was measured by monitoring changes in absorbance (A550 - A540) over 3 min. ROS Generation by Isolated Mitochondria—Rat liver mitochondria (1 mg/ml protein) in MIB supplemented with 5 mm succinate were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed three times at 30 °C. After he addition of adaphostin and/or catalase, samples were incubated for 1 h at 30°C. The concentration of H2O2 generated was assayed using Amplex Red (20Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar) as described above. Docking of Adaphostin into the Drug-binding Sites of the Cytochrome bc1 Complex in Silico—Four different conformations of adaphostin were docked into two binding sites of the heme bH-containing cytochrome b subunit of the cytochrome bc1 complex using the EUDOC program with rotational and translational increments of 10° of arc and 0.5 Å, respectively (33Pang Y.-P. Perola E. Xu K. Prenderast F.G. Journal Comput. Chem. 2001; 22: 1750-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The atomic charges of adaphostin were generated according to the RESP procedure (34Claassen G.F. Hann S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9498-9503Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) with ab initio calculations at the HF/6-31G* level using the Gaussian 03 program (35Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B.

The adaphostin conformations were generated by systematically altering the conformation-governing torsions and subsequently optimized by energy minimizations using the force field (parm99.dat) of Cornell et al.

The energy minimizations were monitored for reaching local minimum conformations with a normal mode analysis using the NMODE module of AMBER8 (37Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S.

https://openalex.org/W2025850462,"The mechanism leading to reinitiation of translation after termination of protein synthesis in eukaryotes has not yet been resolved in detail. One open question concerns the way the post-termination ribosome is tethered to the mRNA to allow binding of the necessary initiation factors. In caliciviruses, a family of positive strand RNA viruses, the capsid protein VP2 is translated via a termination/reinitiation process. VP2 of the feline calicivirus is encoded in the 3′-terminal open reading frame 3 (ORF3) that overlaps with the preceding ORF2 by four nucleotides. In transient expression studies, the efficiency of VP2 expression was 20 times lower than that of the ORF2 proteins. The close vicinity of the ORF2 termination signal and the ORF3 AUG codon was crucial, whereas the AUG could be replaced by alternative codons. Deletion mapping revealed that the 3′-terminal 69 nucleotides of ORF2 are crucial for VP2 expression. This sequence contains two essential sequence motifs. The first motif is conserved among caliciviruses and complementary to part of the 18 S rRNA. In conclusion, VP2 is expressed in a translation termination/reinitiation process that is special because it requires a sequence element that could prevent dissociation of post-termination ribosomes via hybridization with 18 S rRNA.

Translation of proteins is a key process in living cells and a prominent site of gene regulation that occurs at the step of translational initiation (reviewed in Refs. 1Kapp L.D. Lorsch J.R. Annu.

For most eukaryotic mRNAs, initiation begins with recruitment of the translation machinery at a 5′ m7GpppN cap structure and conforms to elements of the ribosomal scanning mechanism (4Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar). Because the small ribosomal subunit starts scanning at the 5′-terminal cap structure of the RNA and then migrates linearly in the 3′ direction, translation usually starts at the AUG codon closest to the 5′-end. In higher eukaryotes, the AUG has to reside in a favorable sequence context; otherwise at least some of the ribosomal subunits can pass by and initiate at an AUG further downstream, which can result in expression of proteins that differ from the relevant mRNA (5Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 6Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 7Peri S. Pandey A.

Many of these were first detected in viruses because viruses have developed a variety of strategies to ensure translation of their RNAs in competition with cellular RNAs (reviewed in Refs. 9Ryabova L.A.

Different types of these mechanisms have been identified that rely on special sequences in the RNA and in some cases on the presence of specific proteins that facilitate shunting (17Park H.S.

IRESs represent specialized RNA structures that are able to assemble initiation complexes at internal sites of the mRNA, a principle that is found in a variety of cellular and especially viral RNAs (reviewed in Refs. 19Pestova T.V.

Gene (Amst.). 2002; 299: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The biochemistry behind such a termination/reinitiation process is not fully understood. In two cases, the implication of upstream sequences has been reported although the function of these sequences is not known (24Gould P.S. Easton A.J. J. Biol.

Academic Press, New York2000: 725-735Google Scholar). Members of the Caliciviridae are nonenveloped viruses with nonsegmented single-stranded RNA genomes of positive polarity. The caliciviral genomes have a length of about 7.5 kb and carry a viral protein VPg that is covalently linked to the RNA 5′-end. The viral genomic RNA contains 2 or 3 functional ORFs. Within the infected cells, genome-sized RNA and one species of subgenomic mRNA (sg mRNA) are found. The sg mRNA is 3′-coterminal with the viral genome and codes for a major capsid protein VP1 of about 60 kDa and a minor capsid protein VP2 with a size that varies among viruses from ∼8 to more than 20 kDa. VP2 is expressed from a small 3′-terminal ORF that overlaps with the preceding VP1-encoding ORF.Caliciviruses are special with regard to initiation of viral protein translation because they seem to use VPg as kind of a cap substitute that interacts with translation initiation factors (27Chaudhry Y.

Moreover, the small 3′-terminal ORF of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) was shown to be translated according to a novel termination/reinitiation mechanism, dependent on an RNA element upstream of the start/stop site (25Meyers G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 34051-34060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).The present report shows that the 3′-terminal ORF3 of the feline calicivirus is also initiated by a termination/reinitiation mechanism dependent on an upstream sequence element. Deletion analyses were conducted to identify crucial elements in this sequence, which were further characterized, so that a functional model could be proposed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Viruses—BHK-21 cells (kindly provided by T.

Restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany) and Fermentas GmbH (Sankt Leon-Rot, Germany). Plasmid pCITE-2A containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter followed by a picornavirus IRES was purchased from AGS (Heidelberg, Germany).Plasmid pCH1 was established by inserting a fragment generated by PCR with pCL1 and primers Ol-FCV-NdeI-Nterm and Ol-FCVSphI-Cterm, cut with NdeI and SphI into pCITE2a. pCL1 was generated by cutting pCI (Promega) with BglII and EcoRI, end-filling with Klenow polymerase, and religation; the resulting plasmid was cut with SmaI and BamHI, end-filled with Klenow polymerase, and religated, followed by cutting with AccI, end-filling with Klenow polymerase, cut with KpnI, ligated with a PCR fragment containing ORF2 and ORF3 of FCV, amplified by PCR with the infectious cDNA clone for FCV 2024 pIK12 (32Thumfart J.O.

QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) was used to introduce point mutations and small deletions. In addition, standard cloning procedures combined with PCR approaches were employed. PCR fragments were amplified in 30 cycles (45 s at 95 °C, 60 s at 55 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C) with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs). The PCR for QuikChange mutagenesis was conducted in 16 cycles (60 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, and 12 min at 68 °C) with Pfu polymerase (Promega) using the buffer and conditions proposed by the manufacturer. The primers were purchased from Invitrogen.The cloned PCR products were all verified by nucleotide sequencing with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Sequence analysis and alignments were done with Genetics Computer Group software (33Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O.A.

J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34051-34060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). VP2 expression efficiency was quantified after SDS-PAGE separation of VP1 and VP2 precipitated with antisera V1 (32Thumfart J.O. Meyers G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6398-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and V2 (raised against bacterially expressed VP2), respectively. The gels were analyzed with a Fujifilm BAS-1500 phosphorimager, and intensities of the signals were determined with TINA 2.0 software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). The molar ratio of VP1 and VP2 was calculated based on the number of labeled residues within the proteins and the measured radioactivity. For comparison of expression efficiencies of different constructs, the VP2 expression level of the given wild-type construct was defined as 100%. The amount of VP2 expression of the other constructs was normalized using the values determined for L-VP1 or Npro and Npro-VP1 as internal standard. The corrected value for VP2 was then used for calculation of the expression efficiency given as a percentage of the wild-type value. The data presented here represent the averages of at least three independent experiments.To exclude effects of different mRNA stability on the outcome of the experiments, four selected constructs showing considerably reduced VP2 expression and the wild-type plasmid were analyzed in duplicate for intracellular steady state mRNA levels after transfection of MVA-T7-infected BHK-21 cells via Northern blot. The detected differences with regard to the data for the wild-type construct were within the expected experimental variation and much smaller than the effects observed on the protein level (not shown).RESULTSVP1 Is Expressed with Much Higher Efficiency Than VP2—The FCV capsid proteins are encoded by two ORFs that overlap by four nucleotides and are contained in the genomic and the sg mRNA (Fig. 1). The minor capsid protein VP2 is incorporated into the particle in much lower amounts than the major capsid protein VP1 (35Sosnovtsev S.V. Green K.Y. Virology. 2000; 277: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To analyze, whether it is also expressed to much lower levels, the molar ratio of VP1 and VP2 in infected cells was determined. The analyses were conducted with extracts prepared 6-h postinfection, a time point at which no considerable cytopathogenic effect can be detected.Both capsid proteins were detected in the lysates of infected CRFK cells by immunoprecipitation with antisera specific for VP1 or VP2, respectively. To assure quantitative protein recovery, precipitation was performed twice, and the two precipitates were combined. The supernatant of the second precipitation did no longer contain relevant amounts of the proteins (data not shown). The molar ratio of VP1 and VP2 in the cells was ∼18:1, as calculated from the radioactivity incorporated in the precipitates (average of more than five experiments).The expression of the FCV capsid proteins does not depend on the presence of non-structural proteins but is driven by the sg mRNA (36Herbert T.P. Brierley I. Brown T.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We therefore used a transient expression system to analyze the mechanisms responsible for VP2 expression. A cDNA construct, pCH1, was established that contains the regions coding for the leader protein (L) and the two capsid proteins (Fig. 1). In the RNA derived from pCH1, L-VP1 translation is initiated by an EMCV IRES, whereas the VP2 coding ORF and its upstream region are in the wild-type configuration. Both capsid proteins can be detected in extracts of transfected CRFK (not shown) or BHK-21 cells (Fig. 3, lane pCH1). The molar ratio of VP1 and VP2 (∼18:1 in CRFK cells and 23:1 in BHK cells) was similar to that found in infected cells. Because of the higher expression levels, BHK-21 cells were used to analyze the mechanism of VP2 translation.FIGURE 3Influence of VP1 translation on VP2 expression. A, insertion of four extra nucleotides (written in bold face and underlined) at a BglII site (BglII*) 275 nucleotides upstream of the ORF2 stop codon results in premature termination of ORF2. A gray bar indicates the protein encoded by ORF2. The L-VP1* expressed from the frameshift mutant pCH72 is truncated by 70 amino acids, and the C-terminal 18 amino acids of the protein represent nonFCV residues (light gray area). Below the scheme, autoradiographs show the immunoprecipitated products of the frameshift construct, compared with wild type construct pCH1.

To analyze the importance of an initiator AUG for VP2 translation, the codon was exchanged in pCH1 for ATA, CTG, GTG, CTA, or TGC, respectively. Except for the triple mutant (TGC), all variants showed VP2 translation, but at somewhat reduced rates (data not shown). To analyze this effect quantitatively, the pCnC constructs were generated, in which the Npro gene from a pestivirus was fused in-frame to the 3′-end of the VP2 coding sequence to serve as a reporter (Fig. 2). The VP2-Npro fusion protein expressed from these constructs contains 7 or 8 (TGC mutant) cysteines. The total amount of VP2-Npro translated from these constructs was quantified after cysteine labeling. In all cases, translation of the fusion protein was detected (Fig. 2, left side). The single base substitutions showed expression levels of 47–58% compared with the ATG construct (pCnC63) and the two-base substitution 35%. Even the exchange of the complete triplet still led to a translational efficiency of 12% of the wild-type level.FIGURE 2Importance of AUG as a start codon for VP2 translation. The upper region shows a schematic drawing of constructs pCH1 (wildtype) and pCnC63 with mutation of the second methionine in ORF3 and fusion of a reporter sequence coding for the protein Npro to the 3′-end of ORF3. Below the bar representing pCnC63, the changed 5′-terminal sequences of the ORF3 start codon mutants are shown (mutated residues in bold face, underlined). Below the scheme, an autoradiograph shows the expression products labeled with cysteine (left) or methionine (right) and precipitated with antisera specific for VP1 (upper panel) and VP2 (lower panel). The sequences of the mutated initiation codons are given above the gel. Below the gel, VP2-Npro expression levels relative to the pCnC63 control are given (mean values of at least three independent experiments, data normalized relative to the expression levels of L-VP1). Cells infected with MVA-T7 served as a negative control (Vacc).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the fusion proteins initiate with a methionine or the amino acid encoded by the changed codon, a second methionine present in the VP2 part of the above described fusion protein was exchanged for a cysteine (pCnC constructs, Fig. 2). The resulting VP2-Npro fusion protein contains no internal methionine. After labeling with [35S]methionine, VP2-Npro was detected for all constructs except the triple mutant (Fig. 2, right side). Comparison of quantification results after cysteine and methionine labeling (Fig. 2 left and right part, respectively) showed that indeed most of the proteins derived from the single and double mutants contained an initiator methionine. The failure to detect the protein from the TGC mutant after methionine labeling might be caused by the inefficient VP2 expression from this construct. Taken together, VP2 translation is not dependent on an AUG initiation codon but is driven by a methionine tRNA-dependent initiation mechanism. The latter is also true for most initiations on the recombinant RNAs with altered AUG codons.VP2 Expression Is Dependent on VP1 Translation—Assuming that, similar to the situation in RHDV, VP2 is translated by a termination/reinitiation mechanism, the translation of VP1 should be essential for VP2 expression. To investigate if this is true for FCV, a construct was generated with a frameshift in the ORF2 sequence leading to a stop of VP1 translation about 200-nucleotides upstream of the ORF3 start. Thus, the transfer of ribosomes to the VP2 start site via translation of VP1 was blocked. As expected, a truncated VP1 was expressed from pCH72. Importantly, VP2 was not translated from the pCH72-derived RNA (Fig. 3A).In addition, we wanted to analyze whether the ribosome has only to get to the start of VP2 via translation or whether it also has to terminate before initiation of VP2 translation. For this purpose ORF2 and ORF3 were fused by insertion of one nucleotide close to the start/stop site (Fig. 3B), moving the termination site far away from the VP2 start site to the end of ORF3, but leaving the ORF3 sequence unchanged. Two constructs with a cytosine residue inserted at different positions were established (Fig. 3B, pCH17, pCH18). Both the VP1 and VP2 antisera precipitated the fusion protein L-VP1-VP2 expressed from these constructs, but VP2 alone could not be found (Fig. 3B). These experiments showed that VP2 expression is dependent on translation and termination of translation of the upstream ORF2.A Termination Signal near the ORF3 Start Is Crucial for VP2 Translation—As shown before for the fusion constructs, long distance separation of the ORF2 stop and ORF3 start signals blocks ORF3 translation. To analyze the importance of the original ORF2 termination signal for VP2 expression in more detail, the stop codon of ORF2 was deleted by changing the TGA codon to TGT, TGC, or TGG (Fig. 4, pCH14-16). In contrast to the situation in RHDV, the elimination of the bona fide ORF2 termination signal had only a mild effect on VP2 expression (reduction to ∼70–90% of the wild-type level). We hypothesized that this could be caused by the presence of two additional in-frame termination signals located at positions 10–12 and 16–18 downstream of the genuine ORF2 stop codon. In another approach, these downstream termination signals were eliminated in addition to the genuine stop codon. After transfection of the resulting triple mutants, VP2 expression could no longer be detected (Fig. 4, pCH24-26). The loss of VP2 translation is not a consequence of the destruction of an essential downstream signal, because the sole mutation of the two downstream stop codons resulted in VP2 translation. The change of the sequence context is nevertheless of some importance, because the VP2 translation level of this mutant was reduced to 42% compared with the wild-type construct (Fig. 4, pCH70). Taken together, a termination signal near the ORF3 start is crucial for VP2 translation.FIGURE 4Importance of the ORF2 stop codon for expression of ORF3. On top, partial sequences of wild type pCH1 and mutants with elimination of the ORF2 stop codon (pCH14-16) and of in-frame termination signals downstream of the original stop (pCH24-26, pCH70) are shown. ORF2 in-frame stop codons are underlined, and the mutated nucleotides are written in bold face. Below, autoradiographs show the products precipitated after transient expression. The VP2 expression efficiency is given below the gel for each construct as the percentage of the value determined for pCH1 (data normalized relative to the levels of L-VP1 expression).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A Sequence of About 70 Nucleotides Upstream of the Start/Stop Site Is Essential for VP2 Translation—In RHDV, translation reinitiation at the start codon of its 3′-terminal ORF is dependent on an RNA sequence preceding the start/stop site (25Meyers G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34051-34060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We tried to identify a similar element in FCV RNA with a series of in-frame deletion mutants in ORF2. In a first set of constructs, ∼500, 200, 100, 70, or 55 nucleotides of the ORF2 3′-region were preserved. VP2 translation was only observed when more than 55 nucleotides of the ORF2 sequence were still present (data not shown). To map the essential region more precisely, a second set of deletion mutants with an Npro reporter gene fused to the 5′-terminal end was generated preserving 84, 72, 69, or 66 nucleotides of the ORF2 3′-region (Fig. 5). Constructs with at least 72 residual ORF2 nucleotides showed a rather small reduction of the expression level (∼75% compared with the pCnN1 construct). A construct with only 69 ORF2 nucleotides yielded 30% of the wild-type level, and a further reduction of the ORF2 sequence to only 66 or fewer nucleotides led to total loss of VP2 translation (Fig. 5). In conclusion, the 69 3′-terminal nucleotides of ORF2 represent the minimal essential sequence required for translation of the following ORF3. In the context of RHDV, we referred to this region as the “termination upstream ribosomal binding site” (TURBS).FIGURE 5Importance of the ORF2 sequence for translation of VP2. Schematic representation of a series of constructs with in-frame deletions in ORF2. The sequence coding for Npro was fused to the ORF2 sequence at different positions so that the newly established reading frames contained the 810, 84, 72, 69, and 66 3′-terminal residues of ORF2, respectively. Below the scheme, autoradiographs show the products precipitated after transient expression of the pCnN constructs with antisera against VP2 and Npro. As Npro is an autoprotease cleaving at its own C terminus, the shortened Npro-VP1 fusion proteins (Npro-VP1* and Npro-VP1Δ) and Npro alone can be detected. Below the left gel, calculated VP2 expression efficiencies are given (relative to pCNn1, normalized to the expression levels of Npro-VP1Δ/Npro).View Large"
https://openalex.org/W2044280188,"Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM) is believed to have a critical role in carcinogenesis and cell proliferation. However, the association of Ep-CAM with cancer invasion and progression is less clear. We found that Ep-CAM was highly expressed on low-invasive cells compared with highly invasive cells. Forced expression of Ep-CAM decreased cancer invasiveness, and silencing Ep-CAM expression elevated cancer invasiveness. Ep-CAM expression was associated with promoter methylation. Treatment with a demethylating agent, and/or the histone deacetylase inhibitor reactivated Ep-CAM expression in Ep-CAM-negative cells and inhibited cancer invasiveness. Using a promoter–reporter construct, we demonstrated methylation of the promoter fragment drive Ep-CAM-silenced transcription. Additionally, silenced Ep-CAM gene in cancer cells was enriched for hypermethylated histone 3 lysine 9. When unmethylated and active, this promoter was associated with acetylated histone 3 lysine 9. Furthermore, we observed an increased association of Ep-CAM promoter with repression components as tumor invasiveness increased. In cancer tissues, Ep-CAM expression significantly correlated with tumor progression and associated with promoter methylation. Our data support the idea that modulation of Ep-CAM plays a pivotal role in tumor invasion and progression. Moreover, aberrant DNA methylation of Ep-CAM is implicated in enhancing invasive/metastatic proclivity of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2023039726,"Previously, we identified calcium-independent phospholipase A2γ (iPLA2γ) with multiple translation initiation sites and dual mitochondrial and peroxisomal localization motifs. To determine the role of iPLA2γ in integrating lipid and energy metabolism, we generated transgenic mice containing the α-myosin heavy chain promoter (αMHC) placed proximally to the human iPLA2γ coding sequence that resulted in cardiac myocyte-restricted expression of iPLA2γ (TGiPLA2γ). TGiPLA2γ mice possessed multiple phenotypes including: 1) a dramatic ∼35% reduction in myocardial phospholipid mass in both the fed and mildly fasted states; 2) a marked accumulation of triglycerides during brief caloric restriction that represented 50% of total myocardial lipid mass; and 3) acute fasting-induced hemodynamic dysfunction. Biochemical characterization of the TGiPLA2γ protein expressed in cardiac myocytes demonstrated over 25 distinct isoforms by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE Western analysis. Immunohistochemistry identified iPLA2γ in the peroxisomal and mitochondrial compartments in both wild type and transgenic myocardium. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of loosely packed and disorganized mitochondrial cristae in TGiPLA2γ mice that were accompanied by defects in mitochondrial function. Moreover, markedly elevated levels of 1-hydroxyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-hydroxyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were prominent in the TGiPLA2γ myocardium identifying the production of signaling metabolites by this enzyme in vivo. Collectively, these results identified the participation of iPLA2γ in the remarkable lipid plasticity of myocardium, its role in generating signaling metabolites, and its prominent effects in modulating energy storage and utilization in myocardium in different metabolic contexts. Previously, we identified calcium-independent phospholipase A2γ (iPLA2γ) with multiple translation initiation sites and dual mitochondrial and peroxisomal localization motifs. To determine the role of iPLA2γ in integrating lipid and energy metabolism, we generated transgenic mice containing the α-myosin heavy chain promoter (αMHC) placed proximally to the human iPLA2γ coding sequence that resulted in cardiac myocyte-restricted expression of iPLA2γ (TGiPLA2γ). TGiPLA2γ mice possessed multiple phenotypes including: 1) a dramatic ∼35% reduction in myocardial phospholipid mass in both the fed and mildly fasted states; 2) a marked accumulation of triglycerides during brief caloric restriction that represented 50% of total myocardial lipid mass; and 3) acute fasting-induced hemodynamic dysfunction. Biochemical characterization of the TGiPLA2γ protein expressed in cardiac myocytes demonstrated over 25 distinct isoforms by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE Western analysis. Immunohistochemistry identified iPLA2γ in the peroxisomal and mitochondrial compartments in both wild type and transgenic myocardium. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of loosely packed and disorganized mitochondrial cristae in TGiPLA2γ mice that were accompanied by defects in mitochondrial function. Moreover, markedly elevated levels of 1-hydroxyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-hydroxyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were prominent in the TGiPLA2γ myocardium identifying the production of signaling metabolites by this enzyme in vivo. Collectively, these results identified the participation of iPLA2γ in the remarkable lipid plasticity of myocardium, its role in generating signaling metabolites, and its prominent effects in modulating energy storage and utilization in myocardium in different metabolic contexts. Maladaptive changes in lipid metabolism leading to the intracellular accumulation of triglycerides are increasingly recognized as the likely cause of the multiple end organ sequelae of the metabolic syndrome and diabetes (1Zhou Y.T.

Many studies have demonstrated the correlation between the progression of obesity, the intracellular accumulation of triglycerides, and the resultant cellular dysfunction in multiple target organs (7Kopelman P.G.

It is becoming increasingly evident that myocardial lipotoxicity results from the combined influences of an increased lipid burden in conjunction with inadequate utilization. In large part, this is precipitated by the dysfunctional uptake and inefficient oxidation of fatty acyl-CoAs in the mitochondrial and peroxisomal compartments. However, the chemical and enzymatic mechanisms that regulate the balance of lipid extraction, oxidation, and synthesis in myocardium are poorly understood (10Raz I. Eldor R. Cernea S. Shafrir E. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2005; 21: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recently, elegant studies using stable isotope techniques with mass spectrometry (11Bian F. Kasumov T.

In previous work, we identified an intracellular phospholipase, now termed iPLA2γ 2The abbreviations used are: iPLA2γ, calcium-independent phospholipase A2γ; TGiPLA2γ, transgenic mice overexpressing iPLA2γ; BEL, (E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-tetrahydropyran-2-one; COX, cytochrome c oxidase 1V; TAG, triacylglycerol; NL, neutral loss; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; PtdEtn, phosphatidylethanolamine; ESI/MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase; TG, transgenic; WT, wild type; bpm, beats/min; αMHC, α-myosin heavy chain. (GenBank™ accession number AF263613), that contains dual subcellular localization sequences that can direct the enzyme into either the peroxisomal or mitochondrial compartments (12Mancuso D.J.

Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4709-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we postulated that the multiple isoforms of iPLA2γ located in distinct subcellular compartments could participate in modulating the dynamic relationship between peroxisomal and mitochondrial energy production. This could serve to integrate myocardial chemical energy production and storage with heat generation to facilitate metabolic flexibility. In peroxisomes, fatty acyl-CoA oxidation is inefficient because of the exothermic nature of the initial reaction catalyzed by fatty acyl-CoA oxidase that reduces O2 to generate H2O2 without production of NADH. In addition, acetyl-CoA produced during peroxisomal β-oxidation cannot be efficiently utilized for energy production within the peroxisome. Thus, peroxisomes serve to dispose of the energy stored in fatty acids through the production of heat and the inefficient production of ATP. In contrast, in mitochondria, activation of fatty acyl-CoA is thermodynamically coupled to the production of NADH with near maximal conversion of the Gibbs free energy in fatty acids into ATP. It is now well established that mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency is modulated by uncoupling proteins whose activity is dependent on the content of nonesterified fatty acids in the mitochondrial inner membrane. These fatty acids are likely generated either by mitochondrial phospholipases or fatty acyl-CoA thioesterases (14Gross R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 802: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 15Hesselink M.K. Mensink M. Schrauwen P. Obesity Res. 2003; 11: 1429-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Accumulation of lipid in a cell is dependent on the metabolic clearance of fatty acid in comparison with its rate of extraction. In normal myocardium, the entry and oxidative metabolism of fatty acids are balanced to extract the necessary energy for physiologic function while avoiding lipid accumulation and its resultant toxic sequelae. In recent work, we have demonstrated that iPLA2γ can act as a signaling enzyme through the generation of 2-polyunsaturated acyl (20:4 or 22:6) lysophosphatidylcholines that serve as precursors of eicosanoid metabolites (by the action of lysophospholipases), cannabinoids (by the action of phospholipase C (16Yan W.

Ueda-Semmyo K. Yoda E. Kuwata H. Takanezawa Y. Aoki J. Arai H. Sumimoto H. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol.

Pfeiffer and co-workers (21Gadd M.E. Broekemeier K.M. Crouser E.D. Kumar J. Graff G. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6931-6939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that calcium-independent phospholipase A2 plays an important regulatory role in mitochondrial function through the generation of fatty acids and modulation of the permeability pore transition. Despite these advances, the significance of iPLA2γ in the regulation of cellular lipid metabolism, signaling, and bioenergetics is largely unknown. To gain insight into the role of iPLA2γ in cardiac lipid metabolism, we generated mice that express human iPLA2γ in a cardiac myocyte selective manner using the α-myosin heavy chain (αMHC) promoter. We now report that murine myocardium overexpressing iPLA2γ can function normally with only 70% of its wild type endogenous phospholipid content. Remarkably, during 16 h of caloric restriction, triglyceride levels increase 7.5-fold in TGiPLA2γ myocardium to account for ∼50 mol % of total myocardial cellular lipid. Moreover, these acute changes in triglyceride levels precipitate hemodynamic compromise. Collectively, these results identify the major myocardial isoforms of iPLA2γ, demonstrate both their peroxisomal and mitochondrial distribution in both wild type and transgenic myocardium, and underscore the role of iPLA2γ in the adaptive regulation of lipid content and triglyceride metabolism in different metabolic contexts.

Most other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Generation of Mice Selectively Overexpressing iPLA2γ in Cardiomyocytes—Mice overexpressing human iPLA2γ were prepared by exploiting the cardiomyocyte specificity of the αMHC promoter. Briefly, we utilized PCR to engineer SalI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the full-length 2.3-kb coding sequence of human iPLA2γ. The SalI-digested fragment was cloned into SalI-digested and alkaline phosphatase-treated α-MHC vector and sequenced in both directions. A NotI fragment containing the αMHC promoter in tandem with the iPLA2γ sequence was utilized for microinjection of DNA directly into the pronuclei of mouse (B6CBAF1/J) zygotes, which resulted in integration of the transgene into the mouse germ line. Founder mice were identified by PCR analysis of mouse tail DNA and then bred with WT B6CBAF1/J mice (The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) for at least three generations to establish the transgenic line. 3-4-Month-old hemizygous offspring mice were used in all studies. The degree of iPLA2γ expression was determined by quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and fluorescent measurement of tissue sections. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry of Lipids—Lipid extraction from mouse tissue and multidimensional ESI/MS analyses were performed as described previously utilizing a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron TSQ Quantum, San Jose, CA) operating under Xcalibur software (22Han X. Cheng H. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15584-15594Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis and fingerprinting of TAG molecular species directly from lipid extracts were performed as described previously (23Han X. Gross R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10635-10639Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 24Han X. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 295: 88-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The first and third quadrupoles served as analyzers in tandem mass spectrometry, whereas the second quadrupole was used as the collision cell with collision gas pressure set at 1.0 millitorr, and collision energy varied with the classes of lipids as described previously (25Han X. Yang J. Cheng H. Ye H. Gross R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 330: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Under typical conditions, the profile mode utilized a 1-min period of signal averaging along with a 2-min period of signal averaging in each tandem MS spectrum. Multidimensional mass spectrometric data analyses were performed and authenticated as described previously (22Han X. Cheng H. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15584-15594Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Han X. Yang J. Cheng H. Ye H. Gross R.W. Anal.

Electron Microscopy—Mouse hearts were rinsed in PBS, placed in fixative solution containing glutaraldehyde (2%) and paraformaldehyde (1%) fixative in 0.8 m sodium cacodylate for at least 2 h, washed, placed in post-fixative (1% osmium tetroxide) for 1 h, dehydrated in graded alcohols, and then embedded in PolyBed 812 (Polysciences, Inc, Warrington, PA). Ninety-nanometer-thick sections were prepared and viewed with a JEOL model 1200EX electron microscope. Immunohistochemistry—Paraffin-embedded sections were prepared essentially as described previously (27Kwong K.F. Schuessler R.B. Green K.G. Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. Boineau J.P. Saffitz J.E. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Double labeling of affinity-purified iPLA2γ and cytochrome c oxidase IV (COX) antibodies were performed using frozen ventricular sections as described previously (28Saffitz J.E. Green K.G. Kraft W.J. Schechtman K.B. Yamada K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1662-H1670PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibody dilutions were 1:250 for the COX antibody, 1:100 for the iPLA2γ antibody, and 1:100 for the catalase antibody. The secondary antibodies, indocarbocyanine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cy3™) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and Alexa Fluor 488®-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), were added at 1:200 dilution in PBS for 2 h. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (model 2000, Amersham Biosciences) was performed utilizing an argon/krypton laser wavelength filter setting of 488/568 dual band pass with a laser attenuation of 10% using the 50 μm aperture, in combination with fluorescence microscopy using a ×40 oil immersion lens with numerical aperture of 1.0, lateral resolution of 0.23 μm, and depth resolution of 1.06 μm. The use of this combination resulted in a full width half-maximal focal plane with a thickness of ∼1.0 μm. Identical dilutions of isotype-matched antibodies were utilized as controls for immunostaining with COX and catalase primary antibodies, and affinity-purified normal rabbit serum was used as a control for the iPLA2γ primary antibody in these studies. Substrate Utilization in an Isolated Working Mouse Heart Model—Perfusion of isolated mouse working hearts was based on a procedure described previously (29Belke D.D. Larsen T.S. Lopaschuk G.D. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R1210-R1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adult mice (4-7 months old) were heparinized (100 units intraperitoneally) 10 min prior to anesthesia. Animals were then anesthetized with 5-10 mg of Na+-pentobarbital (intraperitoneally). Hearts were excised and placed in an ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate (KHB) solution (118 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 4.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 5.0 mm glucose, 70 microunits/liter insulin, pH 7.4). Hearts were cannulated first via the aorta and perfused retrograde in Langendorff mode. Following left atrial cannulation, perfusion was switched to working heart perfusion with oxygenated KHB solution containing 1.2 mm palmitate bound to 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin with a preload pressure of 11.5 mm Hg and an afterload pressure of 50 mm Hg for 60 min. To determine palmitate and glucose oxidation rates, trace amounts of [3H]palmitate (0.1 μCi/ml) and [U-14C]glucose (0.1 μCi/ml) were used, respectively. Samples were collected every 10 min for scintillation counting of the amount of 14CO2 trapped in 1 m hyamine hydroxide solution as a result of glucose oxidation, and 3H2O was released into the buffer as a result of palmitate oxidation. Functional measurements of cardiac output and aortic flows, peak systolic pressure, and heart rate were acquired every 10 min for 10 s using inline flow probes (Transonic Systems, Inc., Ithaca, NY), MP100 system software (AcqKnowledge, BIOPAC Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA), and a pressure transducer (TSD 104A, BIOPAC System, Inc.), respectively. Coronary flow was calculated as the difference between cardiac output and aortic flow. Cardiac work was calculated as the product of peak systolic pressure and cardiac output. At the end of each perfusion, hearts were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Prior to freezing, a small piece of heart tissue was isolated for determining the dry to wet weight ratio. Mitochondrial Respiration Analyses—Respiration rates were assessed for mitochondria isolated from heart employing a protocol described previously (30Boehm E.A. Jones B.E. Radda G.K. Veech R.L. Clarke K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H977-H983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hearts from three 4-month-old female mice were pooled per sample. The final washed pellet was suspended in isolation medium, pH 7.2, containing 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm Na-HEPES, and 0.2 mm EDTA. Protein concentrations of the mitochondrial isolate were determined using Micro BCA (Pierce). Respiration of mitochondrial isolates containing 0.5 mg of protein was measured at 30 °C using an optical probe (Oxygen FOXY Probe, Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL) in a 2-ml sealed and continuously stirred respiration chamber. The previously described respiration buffer (40Ramanadham S. Bohrer A. Mueller M. Jett P. Gross R.W. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5339-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) contains the following (in mm): 125 KCl, 20 HEPES, 3 magnesium acetate, 5 KH2PO4, 0.4 EGTA, and 0.3 dithiothreitol, pH 7.1, at 25 °C, with 2 mg of bovine serum albumin. For palmitoyl-l-carnitine respiration, the respiration buffer also contains 20 μm palmitoyl-l-carnitine and 5 mm malate. For pyruvate respiration, the respiration buffer contains 10 mm pyruvate and 5 mm malate. For succinate respiration, 5 mm succinate was present in addition to 10 μm rotenone (to inhibit complex I). Following measurement of state 2 (basal) respiration, state 3 (maximal ADP-stimulated) respiration was determined by exposing isolates to 350 μm ADP. For each mitochondrial isolate, the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane was assessed by adding 8 μm exogenous cytochrome c to ADP-stimulated mitochondria. State 4 (uncoupled) respiration was evaluated following addition of oligomycin (1 μg/ml) to inhibit ATP synthase. The solubility of oxygen in the respiration buffer at 30 °C was taken as 230 nmol of O2 per ml. Respiration rates were expressed as nmol of O2/min/mg of mitochondrial protein. Assay of DGAT Activity—Heart tissue samples from fed and fasted WT and TG mice were homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm KCl, and 0.25 m sucrose utilizing a tissue tearor homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the resultant pellets were then resuspended in homogenization buffer and sonicated (30 times with 1-s pulses at 20% power). The resuspended heart membrane fractions were assayed for DGAT activity in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 100 μm [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA (80,000 dpm/reaction), and 200 μm 1,2-diolein delivered in acetone (1% final concentration) as described previously (31Cases S. Stone S.J. Zhou P. Yen E. Tow B. Lardizabal K.D. Voelker T. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38870-38876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Reactions were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C followed by extraction of the reactants and products into butanol. Radiolabeled triolein was resolved from unreacted [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA and [1-14C]oleic acid (due to endogenous acyl-CoA thioesterase activity) by thin layer chromatography (70:30:1 petroleum ether/diethyl ether/glacial acetic acid) on Partisil LK6D silica gel plates (Whatman) and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Miscellaneous Procedures—Methodologies have been described previously for preparation of tissue homogenates (12Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), SDS-PAGE (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), Western analysis (12Mancuso D.J.

Schrauwen P. Obesity Res. 2003; 11: 1429-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Calcium-independent PLA2 activity of cytosolic and membrane fractions was measured by quantifying the release of radiolabeled fatty acid from 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine essentially as described previously (12Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Experiments employing BEL were performed essentially as described previously (33Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32807-32814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) by preincubation for 3 min in the presence of varying amounts of (R)-BEL, (S)-BEL, or ethanol vehicle before addition of radiolabeled substrate. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described by O'Farrell (34O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an Ettan IPGphor apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) for a total of 17 kV-h (10 mA at 20 °C) followed by electrophoresis on 5-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed with a two-tailed Student's t test comparing transgenic with nontransgenic littermate values. Differences were regarded as significant at p < 0.05. Cardiac Myocyte-restricted Expression of Calcium-independent Phospholipase A2γ Identifies a Complex Pattern of Isoform Expression—Previous work by our group and others has demonstrated the robust expression of iPLA2γ mRNA in myocardium in comparison with other tissues (12Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 35Tanaka H. Takeya R. Sumimoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and has identified the presence of peroxisomal and mitochondrial localization signals (13Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Sims H.F. Cohen J.M. Yang J. Gross R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4709-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 36Yang J. Han X. Gross R.W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the principal functions of iPLA2γ in myocardial phospholipid metabolism, lipid signaling and energy homeostasis, are currently unknown. We reasoned that cardiac myocyte-specific overexpression of iPLA2γ would provide important insights into these and other cellular processes. Accordingly, transgenic mice selectively expressing iPLA2γ in cardiac myocytes were generated through placing an αMHC promoter upstream of the iPLA2γ coding sequence. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of myocardial membrane proteins identified the presence of three major bands at 70, 63, and 50 kDa using an antibody directed toward a 15 amino acid epitope ∼50 residues from the C terminus of iPLA2γ (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 1A). Whereas the 70- and 63-kDa isoforms corresponded approximately to the predicted masses resulting from utilization of downstream AUG start sites starting at nucleotide residues 364 and 661, respectively, the observed 50-kDa protein product likely is a product of in vivo proteolysis because no translation initiation codon is present that would produce a polypeptide of the corresponding molecular weight. Two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blotting of the human iPLA2γ isoforms demonstrated a remarkable diversity in the post-translational modifications of TGiPLA2γ revealing over 25 discrete isoforms (Fig. 1B). Membrane fractions from transgenic myocardium possessed robust phospholipase activity that was not present in other tissues examined (Fig. 1C) and were ∼10-fold more sensitive to inhibition by (R)-BEL in comparison with (S)-BEL (IC50 for (R)-BEL ≈ 2 μm) (Fig. 1D). Thus, the in vivo expression of mature iPLA2γ protein in myocardium is complex and utilizes multiple different translation initiation sites in conjunction with proteolytic processing. Calcium-independent Phospholipase A2γ Is Present in Both Mitochondrial and Peroxisomal Compartments in Wild Type and Transgenic Murine Myocardium—To identify the subcellular distribution of iPLA2γ in both WT and TG mice, immunohistochemical analyses of myocardial tissue sections were performed. Immunochemical staining of wild type (WT) and TGiPLA2γ heart tissue with antibodies directed toward either cytochrome c oxidase (COX) or catalase demonstrated different staining patterns consistent with their known localization in mitochondria or peroxisomes, respectively (Fig. 2). No substantial differences in the individual staining patterns of catalase or cytochrome c oxidase were observed in TGiPLA2γ myocardium relative to those of WT controls. Similar analyses"

We report here the identification of a homolog of PABP2 as an arginine methyltransferase 1 (RMT1)-associated protein in fission yeast. The product of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe pab2 gene encodes a nonessential nuclear protein and demonstrates specific poly(A) binding in vitro. Consistent with a functional role in poly(A) tail metabolism, mRNAs from pab2-null cells displayed hyperadenylated 3′-ends. We also show that arginine residues within the C-terminal arginine-rich domain of Pab2 are modified by RMT1-dependent methylation. Whereas the arginine methylated and unmethylated forms of Pab2 behaved similarly in terms of subcellular localization, poly(A) binding, and poly(A) tail length control; Pab2 oligomerization levels were markedly increased when Pab2 was not methylated. Significantly, Pab2 overexpression reduced growth rate, and this growth inhibitory effect was exacerbated in rmt1-null cells. Our results indicate that the main cellular function of Pab2 is in poly(A) tail length control and support a biological role for arginine methylation in the regulation of Pab2 oligomerization.

Our results indicate that the main cellular function of Pab2 is in poly(A) tail length control and support a biological role for arginine methylation in the regulation of Pab2 oligomerization. The 3′-end of nearly all eukaryotic mRNAs harbors a poly(A) tail. Whereas numerous studies indicate that the presence of a poly(A) tail on a eukaryotic mRNA is required for efficient nuclear export, RNA stability, and translational control (1Dreyfus M. Regnier P. Cell. 2002; 111: 611-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), recent findings have questioned the direct role of the poly(A) tail in specific steps of mRNA metabolism (2Bird G. Fong N. Gatlin J.C. Farabaugh S. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 3Dower K. Kuperwasser N. Merrikh H. Rosbash M.

The length of this stretch of polyadenosines is controlled in a species-dependent manner with average lengths of 70 and 250 nucleotides in yeast and mammals, respectively (5Edmonds M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 285-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mangus D.A. Evans M.C. Jacobson A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 223Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Yet, the exact mechanism that controls poly(A) tail length remains elusive. mRNA poly(A) tail synthesis involves at least 20 different proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cleavage factors I and II (CF I & II) are first responsible for the cotranscriptional cleavage of the pre-mRNA, which is then followed by the polyadenylation of the upstream fragment by members of the cleavage/polyadenylation factor (CPF) complex, including the poly(A) polymerase Pap1 (7Proudfoot N. O'Sullivan J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R855-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Wahle E. Ruegsegger U. FEMS Microbiol.

In the presence of a protein with poly(A) binding activity, CF I/II, CPF, and Pap1 are sufficient to reconstitute poly(A) tail synthesis de novo on an RNA in vitro (10Chen J. Moore C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11Hector R.E. Nykamp K.R. Dheur S. Anderson J.T. Non P.J. Urbinati C.R. Wilson S.M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Swanson M.S.

A. 1997; 94: 7897-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Despite remarkable similarities in the polyadenylation machinery between yeast and mammals, species-specific factors have been described. Particularly, the product of the pabp2/pabpn1 gene is thought to be specific to metazoans (13Kuhn U. Wahle E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1678: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), as no apparent yeast homolog has yet been identified. Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) 3The abbreviations used are: PABP, poly(A)-binding protein; RRM, RNA recognition motif; PRMT, protein arginine methyltransferase; RMT, arginine methyltransferase; OPMD, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAP, poly(A) polymerase. 2 was originally identified through biochemical enrichment of a polyadenylation stimulatory factor from calf thymus extracts (14Wahle E. Cell. 1991; 66: 759-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Mammalian PABP2 is characterized by a putative coiled-coil region, a single RNA recognition motif (RRM), and a C-terminal arginine-rich domain (6Mangus D.A. Evans M.C. Jacobson A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 223Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 13Kuhn U. Wahle E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1678: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The affinity of PAPB2 to synthetic poly(A) tails is in the nanomolar range and requires both the RRM and the C-terminal arginine-rich domain for optimal and specific interaction with poly(A) (15Kuhn U. Nemeth A. Meyer S. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16916-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Wahle E. Lustig A. Jeno P. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2937-2945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments using in vitro polyadenylation assays led to a model in which PABP2 stimulates processive poly(A) synthesis by direct and simultaneous interactions with the growing poly(A) tail and the poly(A) polymerase (17Kerwitz Y. Kuhn U. Lilie H. Knoth A. Scheuermann T. Friedrich H. Schwarz E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3705-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although in vitro experiments have provided information about the biochemical properties of PABP2, little is known about the mechanism by which it regulates poly(A) tail synthesis in vivo. A Drosophila system was recently established to address the function of PABP2 in vivo. These studies provided evidence for the critical role of PABP2 during embryonic development as well as an unsuspected role in the regulation of cytoplasmic polyadenylation (18Benoit B. Mitou G. Chartier A. Temme C. Zaessinger S. Wahle E. Busseau I. Simonelig M. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). An understanding of the in vivo mechanism by which PABP2 regulates polyadenylation is significant, because the human genetic disorder oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is linked to mutations in the pabp2 gene (19Brais B. Bouchard J.P. Xie Y.G. Rochefort D.L. Chretien N. Tome F.M. Lafreniere R.G. Rommens J.M. Uyama E. Nohira O. Blumen S. Korczyn A.D. Heutink P. Mathieu J. Duranceau A. Codere F. Fardeau M. Rouleau G.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). A physiological hallmark of this disorder is the accumulation of fibrous inclusions in the nuclei of skeletal muscle fibers that consist of PABP2 aggregates (20Calado A. Tome F.M. Brais B. Rouleau G.A. Kuhn U. Wahle E. Carmo-Fonseca M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Yet, the molecular defects in PABP2 function that lead to the establishment of this disease remain unclear. Mammalian PABP2 is also subject to a post-translational modification where specific arginine residues are methylated (21Smith J.J. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Tang J. Nemeth A. Linder M. Herschman H.R. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13229-13234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). How arginine methylation modulates the function of PABP2 as well as the cellular methyltransferase responsible for PABP2 methylation remains unknown. Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT) catalyze the monomethylation of specific arginine residues in proteins using S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a methyl donor. PRMTs are divided into two major classes depending on the type of dimethylarginine they generate: type I PRMTs modify proteins by the catalysis of asymmetric NG-NG-dimethylarginine, whereas type II PRMTs catalyze the formation of symmetric NG-NG-dimethylarginine (22Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). prmt-encoding genes have been identified from the sequenced genomes of yeast, worms, flies, plants, and mammals; but not prokaryotes. The biological role of PRMTs is likely mediated by the modification of substrate proteins. Accordingly, extensive large scale efforts have aimed to identify arginine methylated proteins (23Ong S.E. Mittler G. Mann M. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 24Lee J. Bedford M.T.

Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1319-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Based on these and other studies, arginine methylation appears to impact a variety of cellular processes including ribosome biosynthesis (26Bachand F. Silver P.A.

The role of arginine methylation in these cellular pathways is likely regulated by biochemical activities such as protein-protein interactions (31Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A.

Not unexpectedly, mice engineered for deletion of the prmt1 (40Pawlak M.R. Scherer C.A. Chen J. Roshon M.J. Ruley H.E. Mol.

Yet, our understanding of the biological role of each PRMT and how arginine methylation alters the biological function of proteins is limited by the few physiological substrates identified to date. In this study, we report the identification of a nuclear poly(A)-binding protein (Pab2) in fission yeast. Our results reveal that pab2-null cells produce hyperadenylated mRNAs and are cold-sensitive. We also demonstrate that the protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (RMT1) is the enzyme responsible for Pab2 arginine methylation. Experiments to determine the effect of methylation on Pab2 function indicate that the oligomerization levels of Pab2 are increased when it is not methylated. Accordingly, we found that the growth inhibitory effect caused by Pab2 overexpression is exacerbated in rmt1Δ cells. Our results thus establish Pab2 as an important regulator of poly(A) tail length control and support a model in which the oligomerization-dependent cellular toxicity of Pab2 is modulated by arginine methylation. Strains, Growth Media, and Genetic Methods—The complete list of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe strains used in this study is given in Table 1. Cells were grown at 30 °C in yeast extract medium with amino acid supplements (YES) and Edinburgh minimum medium (EMM) containing appropriate amino acid supplements. S. pombe cells were transformed with plasmids and PCR products by the lithium acetate method. Disruption of pab2 was performed by PCR-mediated gene targeting using 100-nt oligonucleotides with 80-nt from the appropriate regions of the pab2 genomic sequence (43Bahler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie 3rd, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide sequences used for the construction of these strains are available upon request. Following transformation of a diploid strain, G418-resistant colonies were screened for pab2 heterozygosity by colony-PCR. Meiosis and sporulation were induced in selected heterozygote diploids by plating on malt extract agar and tetrads were dissected with a micromanipulator (MSM 200, Singer Instruments). nmt1+-dependent gene expression was repressed by the addition of 15 μm thiamine to the growth medium.TABLE 1S. pombe strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeRef.FBY13h+ ade6M210 leu1-32 ura4Δ18 his3Δ126FBY1h+ ade6M210 leu1-32 ura4Δ18 his3Δ1 RMT1Δ::KanMX626FBY2h+ ade6M210 leu1-32 ura4Δ18 his3Δ1 RMT3Δ::KanMX626FBY3h+ ade6M210 leu1-32 ura4Δ18 his3Δ1 RMT5Δ::KanMX626FBY106h+ ade6 leu1-32 ura4Δ18 his3Δ1 (spore A)This studyFBY107h− ade6 leu1-32 ura4Δ18 his3Δ1 pab2::kanMX6 (spore B)This studyFBY108h− ade6 leu1-32 ura4Δ18 his3Δ1 (spore C)This studyFBY109h+ ade6 leu1-32 ura4Δ18 his3Δ1 pab2::kanMX6 (spore D)This study Open table in a new tab Plasmid Constructs—The cDNAs encoding S. pombe pab2 and pab2ΔC28 (amino acid 1-138) were amplified by RT-PCR using total cellular RNA extracted from fission yeast. The amplifications were performed using the same forward primer 5′-CCTAGCTAGCAGTGATCAAGATGCCTTAGA-3′ and the 5′-CGCGGATCCCTAATACGGAGCGAAACCACG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCCTAGCTCATACCAGGAACGTTTGTCC-3′ reverse primers, respectively. Following digestion of the 5′- and 3′-ends of the cDNAs with NheI and BamHI, respectively, the cDNAs were cloned into NheI/BamHI-digested pREP2 and pREP82 vectors (44Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) that contain the DNA sequence encoding for a single Myc epitope tag. The pab2 cDNA was also cloned into BamHI-digested pREP41EGFP-N (45Craven R.A. Griffiths D.J. Sheldrick K.S. Randall R.E. Hagan I.M. Carr A.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) using the primer pair 5′-CGCGGATCCGAGTGATCAAGATGCCTTAGA-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCCTAATACGGAGCGAAACCACG-3′. pGEX4T2-Pab2 and pGEX4T2-Pab2ΔC28 were generated by PCR-amplification using pREP82myc-PAB2 as a template and the forward primer 5′-CGCGGATCCAGTGATCAAGATGCCTTAGA-3′ and the reverse primers 5′-CGCGGATCCCTAATACGGAGCGAAACCACG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCCTAGCTCATACCAGGAACGTTTGTCC-3′, respectively. pREP41EGFPN-RMT5 was generated by RT-PCR amplification of the rmt5 cDNA using the primer pair 5′-CGCGGATCCGTTATTGCGGGATGGCCGT-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTAATACATATTACACGAG-3′ both containing BamHI restriction sites. The PCR-amplified sequences were verified by automated sequencing at the University of Calgary DNA Core Facility. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific to fission yeast RMT1 and RMT3 were raised at Covance Research Products (Denver, PA) against GST fusion proteins purified from Escherichia coli. Rabbit polyclonal Myc antibody A-14 and the mouse monoclonal anti-GST B-14 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Asymmetric dimethylarginine-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody (ASYM24) was from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA) and the rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP was from Invitrogen (Burlington, ON, Canada). Immunoprecipitation Experiments—30-50 ml of mid-log phase fission yeast cells grown in either YES or EMM were used for immunoprecipitation experiments. Cells were lysed in ice-cold PBS-MT (1× phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2 and 1% Triton-X-100) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) with a Fastprep FP120 (Thermo Electro Corp.) using 0.5-mm glass beads. Clarified lysates were normalized for total protein concentration using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad), and 1 mg of total proteins was subjected to immunoprecipitation using agaroseconjugated anti-Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in sample buffer, separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Microscopy—For localization of GFP-Pab2, FBY13, and FBY1, cells that were previously transformed with pREPEGFPN-Pab2 were grown to saturation in EMM containing 15 μm thiamine. Cells were then washed twice to remove the thiamine and allowed to grow for 18-20 h before direct fluorescence microscopy. The nuclei of cells were stained using Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). Recombinant Protein Expression and in Vitro Pull-down Assays—GST, GST-Pab2, and GST-Pab2ΔC28 were expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 cells (Invitrogen). Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C for GST and GST-Pab2ΔC28, and for 18 h at 18 °C for GST-Pab2. Following centrifugation of the cells and subsequent washing in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the bacterial cells were broken by sonication, and the cell membranes were solubilized by the addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%. The cell debris was sedimented by a 10-min centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the clarified lysates were subjected to glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences). After extensive washing, the proteins were eluted from the resin by incubating with 10 mm reduced glutathione resuspended in Tris-HCl pH 8.6; 250 mm NaCl; 0.1% Triton X-100. The proteins were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. For poly(A) pull-down experiments, 2 mg of recombinant protein or 0.5 mg of total cell extracts were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 15 μl of poly(A)-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) that had been previously pre-equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 150 mm NaCl; 0.1% Triton-X-100; 2 mm MgCl2;1mm dithiothreitol; 1 mm EDTA). The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A, and the bound proteins eluted by incubating for 5 min at 95 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For the oligonucleotide polymers competition experiment, 10-fold excess of polyadenylic or polycytidylic acids (Sigma) were added to poly(A)-Sepharose simultaneously with GST-Pab2. The copurification of the different proteins with poly(A)-Sepharose was analyzed by immunoblotting. RNA Analyses—cDNA synthesis from fission yeast total RNA was as previously described (46Bachand F. Lackner D.H. Bahler J. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with the exception that the Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) was used. cDNAs were PCR-amplified with TaqDNA polymerase (NEB) using the following oligonucleotides sets: forward 5′-CCTAGCTAGCAGTGATCAAGATGCCTTAGA-3′ and reverse 5′-CGCGGATCCCTAATACGGAGCGAAACCACG-3′ primers for pab2, and forward 5′-CCATGTTTTGCGCTAGAGCAGGC-3′ and reverse 5′-CTTCTGAAACAGGCTCGCGAT-3′ primers for rmt1. Poly(A) tail length analyses were based on a previously described method (47Minvielle-Sebastia L. Winsor B. Bonneaud N. Lacroute F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 3075-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of total fission yeast RNA was 3′-end-labeled at 4 °C for 18-20 h with 25 μCi of [32P]cytidine biphosphate using T4 RNA ligase (Ambion). Following digestion of RNAs with RNases T1 and A, the remaining poly(A) tails were ethanol precipitated after proteinase K and phenol-choloform treatments. Poly(A) tracts were separated on 8% acrylamide-7 m urea gels and analyzed using a STORM 860 instrument (Molecular Dynamics). A Gene Product Similar to Nuclear Poly(A)-binding Proteins Copurifies with the Fission Yeast Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 1 (RMT1)—An affinity purification approach was used to identify novel RMT1-binding proteins in the fission yeast S. pombe. Homologous recombination-mediated gene tagging generated a strain that expresses C-terminal TAP-tagged RMT1 from its endogenous promoter. Following tandem purification and analysis of the eluted protein mixture by mass spectrometry, peptides corresponding to several RNA recognition motif (RRM)-containing proteins were identified (Table 2). Inspection of the amino acid sequence of the uncharacterized spbc16e6.12c gene revealed extensive similarity to nuclear poly(A)-binding proteins: a predicted coiled-coil domain consisting of regularly spaced aliphatic residues, a single RNP-type RRM, and a C-terminal arginine-rich domain (Fig. 1). Similar to the Drosophila nuclear poly(A)-binding protein (PABP2), the S. pombe spbc16e6.12c gene product is considerably shorter than metazoan PABP2 proteins because of the lack of an N-terminal region rich in alanine, glycine, glutamic acid, and proline residues. Fission yeast SPBC16E6.12c shares 47% identity and 66% similarity with human PABP2. We therefore named the S. pombe spbc16e6.12c gene pab2 on the basis of this homology. Sequence searches did not find any pab2 ortholog in the S. cerevisiae genome.TABLE 2Proteins identified by LC-MS/MS from RMT1-TAP purificationS. pombeORF numberMWnaNumber of unique tryptic peptides identified from each protein by mass spectrometry.kDaRMT1SPAC890.07c3946SPBC16E9.12cSPBC16E9.12c208Tif31/p135SPBC530.06c1326rpL7SPBC18H10.12c295Gar1SPBC25H2.01c204Bcr1SPBC582.05c984Rad18SPCC5E4.061304rpL32SPBC16C6.11153Gar2SPAC140.02532a Number of unique tryptic peptides identified from each protein by mass spectrometry. Open table in a new tab A construct expressing Myc-tagged Pab2 was generated to validate our large-scale affinity purification results and examine whether RMT1 could coimmunoprecipitate with S. pombe Pab2. The Myc-Pab2 construct was used to transform wild-type as well as cells in which the genomic copy of the rmt1, rmt3, or rmt5 arginine methyltransferase-encoding gene was deleted. Total cells extracts prepared from the different yeast cultures were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal Myc antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting using various antibodies. As can be seen in Fig. 2, RMT1, but not RMT3, was found to coprecipitate with Myc-Pab2 in extracts prepared from wild-type cells (lane 7). As controls, Myc immunoprecipitates prepared from extracts of vector-transformed (lane 6) and rmt1-null cells that expressed Myc-tagged Pab2 (lane 8) did not recover RMT1. Deletion of the rmt3 or rmt5 coding sequence did not perturb the association between RMT1 and Pab2 (Fig. 2; lanes 9 and 10, respectively). These results are consistent with our tandem affinity purification data and indicate that the arginine methyltransferase RMT1 associates with Pab2 in fission yeast. Pab2 Is Asymmetrically Dimethylated by RMT1—The C-terminal arginine-rich region of human PABP2 is dimethylated at arginines by PRMT1 and PRMT3 in vitro (21Smith J.J. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13229-13234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); yet, the physiological methyltransferase responsible for PABP2 methylation remains to be determined. Given the specific association between RMT1 and Pab2 (Fig. 2), we examined whether Pab2 was arginine methylated in fission yeast. Extracts of cells that were previously transformed with an empty vector or a vector expressing Myc-Pab2 were subjected to immunopurification using a Myc monoclonal antibody. Fig. 3A demonstrates that similar levels of Myc-Pab2 were immunoprecipitated from wild-type (lane 2; upper panel) and arginine methyltransferases-null cell extracts (lanes 3-5; upper panel), but not from vector control-transformed cells (lane 1; upper panel). An affinity-purified antibody specific for asymmetric dimethylarginines (aDMA) (33Cote J. Boisvert F.M. Boulanger M.C. Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 274-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) was used to determine the methylation status of immunopurified Pab2. Reprobing of the membrane used for the Myc immunoblot with the aDMA-specific antibody detected aDMA-modified Pab2 in immunoprecipitates prepared from extracts of wild-type, rmt3Δ, and rmt5Δ cells (lanes 2, 4, and 5, respectively; lower panel), but not from rmt1-null cells (lane 3; lower panel). Immunoblotting with a symmetric dimethylarginine-specific antibody (37Boisvert F.M. Cote J. Boulanger M.C. Cleroux P. Bachand F. Autexier C. Richard S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 957-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) did not detect such modification in Myc-Pab2 (data not shown). These results establish RMT1 as the physiological methyltransferase responsible for Pab2 arginine methylation. Furthermore, our data reveal that no alternate pathways exist to complement Pab2 methylation in the absence of RMT1 in S. pombe. We next set out to identify the region in Pab2 that is arginine methylated. The arginine-rich domain has been shown to be the methylation site of several nucleic acid-binding proteins (48Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including human PABP2 (21Smith J.J. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Tang J. Nemeth A. Linder M. Herschman H.R. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13229-13234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We therefore generated a construct that expresses a C-terminal truncated version of Myc-Pab2 lacking the arginine-rich domain. As can be seen in Fig. 3B, the C-terminal-truncated form of Myc-Pab2 expressed in wild-type cells was not found to contain methylated arginine (lane 3; lower panel); yet, both full-length and truncated versions of Myc-Pab2 were successfully immunopurified (lanes 2-3, upper panel). These results define the C-terminal arginine-rich domain as the major site of arginine methylation in fission yeast Pab2. Fission Yeast Pab2 Is a Nonessential Nuclear Protein—We constructed a diploid strain in which one of the two pab2 alleles was disrupted to address whether pab2 is an essential gene in fission yeast. Germination of the spores after meiosis and tetrad microdissection resulted in a 2:2 segregation ratio of geneticin resistance (Fig. 4A), indicating that pab2-null cells are viable in S. pombe. RT-PCR was used to confirm the absence of pab2 expression in geneticin-resistant cells. Analysis of total RNA prepared from cells derived from the dissection of tetrad 6 (Fig. 4A) demonstrated that geneticin-resistant cells from"

However, the mechanisms by which HOXA1 mediates oncogenic transformation is not well defined. To identify molecules that could potentially be involved in HOXA1-mediated oncogenic transformation, microarray analysis was utilized to characterize and compare the gene expression pattern in response to forced expression or depletion of HOXA1 in human mammary carcinoma cells. Gene expression profiling identified that genes involved in the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation pathway (GRB2, MAP kinase kinase (MEK1) and SDFR1) or p44/42 MAP kinase-regulated genes (IER3, EPAS1, PCNA and catalase) are downstream expression targets of HOXA1. Forced expression of HOXA1 increased GRB2 and MEK1 mRNA and protein expression and increased p44/42 MAP kinase phosphorylation, activity and Elk-1-mediated transcription. Use of a MEK1 inhibitor demonstrated that increased p44/42 MAP kinase activity is required for the HOXA1-mediated increase in cell proliferation, survival, oncogenicity and oncogenic transformation. Thus, modulation of the p44/42 MAP kinase pathway is one mechanism by which HOXA1 mediates oncogenic transformation of the human mammary epithelial cell."

Membranal-embedded tetraspanins, associated with metastasis suppression, are underexpressed in MM. We aimed to investigate the consequences of CD81/CD82 tetraspanins over-expression in MM cell lines. CAG and RPMI 8226 were transfected with pEGFP-N1/C1 fusion vectors of CD81/CD82. Employing flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, and activity assays we assessed transfected cells for: morphology, survival, death, caspases, cell cycle, proliferation, oxidative stress, adhesion, motility and invasion. Overexpressed CD81/CD82 pEGFP-N1 vectors reduced survival without elevation of pre-G1 or AnnexinV+/7AAD- and independently of caspases. Decreased Ki67 and elevated intracellular glutathione were detected. No perturbations in cell cycle distribution were observed. The pEGFP-C1 vectors of CD81/CD82 caused reduction of MM cell adherence with/without fibronectin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, and matrigel. They also reduced cell motility and attenuated invasion potential, expressed by reduced secreted MMP-9 activity. These novel findings delineate the significance of CD81/CD82 expression to MM cell survival and their negative effects on cell adhesion, motility, and invasion thus, supporting their role as tumor metastasis suppressors."
https://openalex.org/W2088612494,"In certain maize genotypes, called “null,” β-glucosidase does not enter gels and therefore cannot be detected on zymograms after electrophoresis. Such genotypes were originally thought to be homozygous for a null allele at the glu1 gene and thus devoid of enzyme. We have shown that a β-glucosidase-aggregating factor (BGAF) is responsible for the “null” phenotype. BGAF is a chimeric protein consisting of two distinct domains: the disease response or “dirigent” domain and the jacalin-related lectin (JRL) domain. First, it was not known whether the lectin domain in BGAF is functional. Second, it was not known which of the two BGAF domains is involved in β-glucosidase binding and aggregation. To this end, we purified BGAF to homogeneity from a maize null inbred line called H95. The purified protein gave a single band on SDS-PAGE, and the native protein was a homodimer of 32-kDa monomers. Native and recombinant BGAF (produced in Escherichia coli) agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes, and various carbohydrates and glycoproteins inhibited their hemagglutination activity. Sugars did not have any effect on the binding of BGAF to the β-glucosidase isozyme 1 (Glu1), and the BGAF-Glu1 complex could still bind lactosyl-agarose, indicating that the sugar-binding site of BGAF is distinct from the β-glucosidase-binding site. Neither the dirigent nor the JRL domains alone (produced separately in E. coli) produced aggregates of Glu1 based on results from pull-down assays. However, gel shift and competitive binding assays indicated that the JRL domain binds β-glucosidase without causing it to aggregate. These results with those from deletion mutagenesis and replacement of the JRL domain of a BGAF homolog from sorghum, which does not bind Glu1, with that from maize allowed us to conclude that the JRL domain of BGAF is responsible for its lectin and β-glucosidase binding and aggregating activities.

They are found in all three (Archaea, Eubacteria, and Eukarya) domains of living organisms and play important roles in various biological processes, such as degradation of cellulosic biomass, hydrolysis of glycoconjugates, cyanogenesis, and modification of secondary metabolites (1Esen A. Esen A. β-Glucosidase. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1992: 1-14Google Scholar). In plants, β-glucosidase activity is shown to be involved or implicated in several processes, such as defense against pathogens and herbivores (2Poulton J.E. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 3Phillips D.A. Streit W. Stacey G. Keen N. Plant Microbe Interactions.

Biochem. 1978; 84: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In maize, two isozymes of β-glucosidase have been isolated and characterized with respect to structure, including three-dimensional structure, and function (7Cicek M. Esen A. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 63: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Czjzek M. Cicek M. Zamboni V. Bevan D.R. Henrissat B. Esen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13555-13560Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The major function of maize β-glucosidases is in the defense against pathogens and herbivores by releasing toxic aglycones, such as hydroxamic acids, from their glucosides. The predominant hydroxamic acid glucoside in maize is DIMBOAGlc, 2The abbreviations used are: DIMBOAGlc, 2-glucopyranosyl-4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BGAF, β-glucosidase-aggregating factor; nBGAF, native BGAF; rBGAF, recombinant BGAF; JRL, Jacalin-related lectin; mJRL, mannose-specific JRL; gJRL, galactose-specific JRL; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; PSM, porcine stomach mucin; 4-MUGlc, 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucoside; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; MS, mass spectrometry; Neu5Ac, N-acetyl-neuraminic acid; Sb, Sorghum bicolor; Zm, Zea mays. whose aglycone DIMBOA is the primary defense chemical against aphids and the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis). A number of studies have shown a high degree of correlation between DIMBOAGlc content of maize and the level of resistance to insects and pathogens (9Kahler A.L. Wehrhahn C.F. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1986; 72: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Massardo F. Zuniga G.E. Peres L.M. Corcuera L.J. Phytochemistry. 1994; 35: 873-876Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In certain maize genotypes, β-glucosidase occurs as a part of large insoluble complexes (11Esen A. Cokmus C. Biochem. Genet. 1990; 28: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Zymograms of such genotypes are devoid of enzyme bands. Originally, these genotypes were thought to be homozygous for a “null” allele at the glu1 (maize β-glucosidase isozyme Glu1) gene. However, we have shown that the so-called “null” genotypes have β-glucosidase activity when assayed in solution. The enzyme is not detected on zymograms, because it occurs as large quaternary complexes whose native molecular masses may exceed 1.5 × 106 Da. Furthermore, we have shown that the null phenotype is due to a 32-kDa protein called β-glucosidase-aggregating factor (BGAF) (GenBank™ AAF71261), which specifically binds and aggregates maize β-glucosidase, yielding high molecular weight complexes (12Esen A. Blanchard D.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, we cloned the cDNA encoding BGAF and identified it as a protein belonging to the jasmonic acid-induced protein family (13Blanchard D.J. Cicek M. Chen J. Esen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11895-11901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). BGAF is a modular protein consisting of an N-terminal disease response or dirigent domain and a C-terminal jacalin-related lectin (JRL) domain. Dirigent proteins exclusively occur in plants and have been implicated in defense and lignin biosynthesis (14Culley D.E. Horovitz D. Hadwiger L.A. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 301-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Davin L.B. Wang H. Crowell A.L. Bedgar D.L. Martin D.M. Sarkanen S. Lewis N.G. Science. 1997; 275: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). There are 92 dirigent proteins in the pfam data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/). Of these, 83 are stand-alone, and nine are modular. Interestingly, it is only the JRL domain that occurs as a fusion partner in modular dirigent proteins, and they all come from the family Poaceae. Members of the JRL family are lectins and are thought to be involved in plant defense (16Chishlom S.T. Parra M.A. Anderberg R.J. Carrington J.C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 17Williams C.E. Collier C.C. Nemacheck J.A. Liang C. Cambron S.E. J. Chem.

Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 629-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Presently, there are 312 JRLs in the pfam data base. The majority of them come from plants, a few occur in animals, and one occurs in bacterium. Some members of the JRL family have modular structure comprising multiple copies of JRL domains in tandem (2–6 copies) or fused to other proteins, such as dirigent, Kelch (galactose oxidase), NB-ARC (nucleotide-binding proteins involved in ubiquitination), FBA (F-BOX), endonuclease, and a peptidase. Of these 312 JRLs, only a few have been characterized with respect to sugar specificity and structure, including three-dimensional structure. They include Jacalin (Artocarpus integrifolia), Artocarpin (A. integrifolia), Heltuba (Helianthus tuberosus), Calsepa (Calystegia sepium), Banlec (Musa paradisica), MPA (Maclura pomifera), and Parkia platysephala (19Pratap J.V.

Biol. 2005; 353: 574-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on sugar specificity, JRLs are subdivided into two groups: mannose-specific (mJRLs) and galactose-specific (gJRLs) lectins (26Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. Barre A. Rouge P. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1998; 17: 575-692Crossref Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Another major difference between mJRLs and gJRLs concerns their biosynthesis and processing. For example, gJRLs (e.g. jacalin) undergo co-/post-translational modification of a precursor polypeptide chain, forming a larger α-chain and a smaller β-chain (27Yang H. Czapla T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5905-5910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, mJRLs have a single polypeptide chain as their monomer and are synthesized on free ribosomes and localized to the cytosol (28Peumans W.J. Hause B. Van Damme E.J.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). There are at least 10 BGAF-like sequences in the pfam data base (including BGAF). Of these, only BGAF has been characterized functionally (β-glucosidase aggregation activity only). However, little or no information is available about their lectin activity and sugar specificity. It is not known whether the lectin domain in these proteins is functional and, if it is, what its sugar specificity is. Recently, Molina et al. (29Molina J. Landa A. Bautista G. Martinez M. Cordoba F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1674: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) isolated β-glucosidase complexed with another protein from corn coleoptiles and showed it to be a lectin. Furthermore, based on SDS-PAGE and partial amino acid sequence data, they identified a 30-kDa protein in the complex, which was homologous to maize BGAF. Although the authors attributed the lectin activity to the 30-kDa protein, they did not isolate the native 30-kDa protein free from β-glucosidase and show experimentally its lectin activity. The JRL domain of maize BGAF shares approximately 40% sequence identity with gJRLs and mJRLs. BGAF (expressed in E. coli) does not undergo processing, and therefore it is expected to behave like a mannose-specific lectin. In continuation of our work on maize BGAF, we were interested in whether or not the JRL domain of BGAF has lectin activity and, if it does, what its carbohydrate specificity is. In addition, we were interested in determining which one of the two BGAF domains is involved in β-glucosidase binding and aggregation. In this paper, we show that maize BGAF is a polyspecific lectin, its carbohydrate and β-glucosidase-binding sites reside in the JRL domain, and these two sites do not overlap. Materials—The maize null line H95 was grown in a growth chamber at temperatures of 30 °C (night) and 24 °C (day) in darkness. After 3–4 days, etiolated shoots were harvested by cutting at the mesocotyl region below the node and stored at –80 °C until use. All sugars and glycoproteins for affinity chromatography and hemagglutination inhibition tests were purchased from Sigma. Lactosyl-agarose lectin affinity matrix was from EY Laboratories (San Mateo, CA). Sephacryl-HR 200 and nickel-Sepharose™ 6 Fast Flow were purchased from GE Healthcare. The BioSep-SEC-S 2000 gel filtration column was purchased from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA). Pfu DNA polymerase and the plasmid vectors pBlueScript I SK+, pET 21a, and pET 15b were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and Novagen (Madison, WI), respectively. Purification of BGAF from Maize H95 Inbred Line—After discovering that the JRL domain could compete with full-length BGAF for the binding site on maize Glu1, we used the recombinant JRL domain to remove Glu1 from the BGAF-Glu1 complex and to purify BGAF in free form. Briefly, 15 g of maize H95 shoots were homogenized with 45 ml of 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded onto a 0.5-ml lactosyl-agarose column, which had been equilibrated with PBS. The unbound proteins were removed by washing, and then the matrix (lactosyl-agarose) was transferred to a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube. To this, 1.0 ml of recombinant JRL protein (2 mg/ml) was added, and the suspension was incubated on a rocking shaker overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the suspension was centrifuged at 3000 × g, the supernatant was removed, and the matrix was repacked into a column (0.5 × 5 cm). Unbound JRL and JRL-Glu1 complex were removed by washing with PBS. Bound BGAF (free) and a minor amount of BGAF-Glu1 complex were eluted with 100 mm lactose in PBS. Fractions containing free BGAF and complex were identified by β-glucosidase activity (both elute together at 100 mm lactose concentration). To separate free BGAF from the minor BGAF-Glu1 complex contaminant, the above fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and loaded onto a Sephacryl HR 200 gel filtration column (80 × 1.6 cm) that had been equilibrated with PBS. The column was developed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing free BGAF were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, pooled, and concentrated using a Vivaspin20 spin column (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany). Purification of β-Glucosidase-BGAF Complex—We discovered that the insoluble portion of the BGAF-Glu1 complex could be solubilized when Gal or lactose is included in the extraction buffer. To isolate the complex, the maize H95 null line pellet left after BGAF extraction was suspended in PBS containing 25 mm lactose and incubated on ice for 1 h. The suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was decanted and dialyzed against PBS overnight to remove lactose. The dialysate was then loaded onto a lactosylagarose column, which had been equilibrated with PBS. The column was washed with PBS, and the bound complex was eluted with 100 mm lactose. Fractions containing β-glucosidase activity were pooled, dialyzed against PBS, and stored at –20 °C until use. Hemagglutination and Inhibition Assay—Fresh whole rabbit blood (5.0 ml) was washed three times and suspended in 15 ml of PBS, pH 7.4. Trypsin (50 μl, 10 mg/ml solution in PBS, pH 7.4) was added to the washed erythrocytes and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The trypsinized erythrocytes were washed three times with PBS and suspended in the same buffer to give a 2% suspension. Hemagglutination activity of native free BGAF, rBGAF, and BGAF-Glu1 complex was determined by a 2-fold dilution procedure using trypsin-treated rabbit erythrocytes. The hemagglutination titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution exhibiting hemagglutination. Inhibition of hemagglutination by saccharides and glycoproteins was assayed by serially diluting the saccharide solutions in the microtiter plate wells, followed by the addition of 4 units of the lectin, followed by the addition of a 2% suspension of trypsintreated rabbit erythrocytes after 30 min. The lowest concentration of saccharides or glycoproteins that visibly decreased agglutination was defined as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), using minigels (0.8 mm thick, 1.5-cm stacking gel and 6.5-cm separating gel). Samples were heated in the presence and absence of 2-mercaptoethanol in a boiling water bath for 5 min, cooled, and loaded (4 μg of protein) onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Mass Spectrometry of Native BGAF after Trypsin Digestion— After SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie blue, the band corresponding to native BGAF was excised and digested with trypsin. The peptide fragments were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS spectrometry on a Micromass MALDI spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) using a matrix of α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid. Peptide masses obtained by MALDI-TOF-MS were compared with the peptide masses obtained by the theoretical trypsin digestion of BGAF using the ExPASy proteomics tool “PeptideMass.” Molecular Mass and Structure of Native BGAF—The molecular mass and quaternary structure of BGAF were determined by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration chromatography, respectively. Gel filtration was carried out on a BioSep-SEC-S 2000 HPLC column (7.8 × 300 mm) equilibrated and developed with PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min operating at room temperature on a Waters Breeze HPLC system (Waters). The column was calibrated with the following molecular mass standards: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and myoglobin (17 kDa). Protein and Carbohydrate Estimations—Estimates of protein concentration were made with Bradford reagent using crystalline bovine serum albumin as a standard (0–1.0 mg/ml concentration range). The microassay format in 96-well flat bottom plates was employed as described by the manufacturer (Pierce). After 10 min of incubation of the dye and protein mixture, the absorbance was read at 595 nm on a VersaMax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Total neutral sugars were determined by the phenol/sulfuric acid method (31Dubois M. Giles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40882) Google Scholar). Metal Ion Requirements for Lectin Activity—To examine the cation requirement for lectin activity, native BGAF (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated with 10 mm EDTA for 1 h at room temperature and dialyzed against 1 liter of PBS overnight. To the demetalized samples, 1 mm (final concentration) CaCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2, or ZnCl2 were separately added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Then hemagglutination activity was measured as described above. Construction, Cloning, and Expression of Wild-type BGAF, Chimeric BGAF, Truncated BGAFs, and Dirigent and JRL Domains—Full-length BGAF cDNA was recloned and expressed in E. coli, using the primers, template, and vectors described previously (13Blanchard D.J.

DNA sequencing, however, revealed an unintended mutation in the stop codon UGA to UGG (Trp), which adds 3 amino acids and a hexahistidine tag to the C terminus. As a result, the expressed protein had a His tag at the C terminus. Chimeric BGAF was generated using overlap extension PCR (32Kittur F.S. Mangala S.L. Rusd A.A. Kitaoka M. Tsujibo H. Hayashi K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 549: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The chimera contained the dirigent domain of the sorghum (residues 1–153) BGAF homolog (GenBank™ DQ866804), which does not bind maize Glu1, and the JRL domain of the maize BGAF (residues 152–306). To generate N-terminally truncated BGAFs and dirigent and JRL domains, cDNA fragments encoding the desired amino acid sequences (see Table 1) were amplified using primers incorporating NdeI and BamHI sites to the 5′ and 3′ ends of PCR products, respectively. PCR was carried out in a PTC-100 thermal cycler (MJ Research Inc., Alameda, CA) using the high fidelity DNA polymerase pfu. All PCR products were gel-purified, separately cloned into pBluescript SK+ vector, and transformed into E. coli DH10B cells. Positive clones were identified by colony PCR, and the plasmids isolated from them were sequenced by the dideoxy method to confirm the accuracy of the expected insert DNA sequence. The above constructs were digested with NdeI and BamHI. The inserts were gel-purified, ligated to the expression vector pET 15b, which had been previously digested with the same set of enzymes, and transformed into E. coli BL-21 CodonPlus competent cells. Selection was carried out with ampicillin and chloramphenicol-containing LB plates. Truncated BGAFs, dirigent domain, JRL domain, and chimeric BGAFs were expressed with a His tag at the N-terminal end. For expression, bacterial colonies harboring cDNA encoding full-length BGAF and its truncated forms were grown in 2-liter LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) under shaking (150 rpm) at 37 °C. In the exponential phase at A600 = 0.6, expression was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.6 mm, and incubation was continued overnight at 24 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS, pH 7.4, resuspended in the same buffer containing DNase I (40 μg/ml), 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and lysed using a French press.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers used in PCR to prepare various BGAF cDNA constructs used in this studyConstructIdentification number of PCR primers used for insert amplification and chimeric protein constructionAmplified BGAF cDNA regionSenseaNumbers in the sense and antisense columns represent primer numbers used in PCRAntisenseaNumbers in the sense and antisense columns represent primer numbers used in PCRZmBGAF Δ1–38bAmino acid numbers deleted from the N-terminal end of intact BGAF6140115–918ZmBGAF Δ1–635740190–918ZmBGAF Δ1–885840265–918ZmBGAF Δ1–1135940340–918ZmBGAF Δ1–1386040415–918ZmDirigent 1–15637381–468ZmJRL 153–3063940457–918SbDirigent-(1–153)-ZmJRL-(152–306)32, 6440, 661–459, 453–918Primer ID no.Primer sequencecPrimer sequences are from 5′ to 3′.

Bacterial cell lysate (25 ml) was applied to a lactosyl-agarose column (1 × 5 cm) previously equilibrated with PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the loading was monitored at 280 nm with a Spectra/Chrom UV detector (Spectrum Chromatography, Houston, TX). The column was washed with PBS until the absorbance of the effluent at 280 nm came to base line. The bound protein was eluted with PBS containing 0.25 m Gal, and the eluate was collected as 2-ml fractions. Fractions containing protein peak were pooled, dialyzed against PBS with two changes of buffer overnight, and stored at –20 °C until use. Truncated BGAFs, chimera, and dirigent and JRL domains were purified by Ni2+ chelation chromatography. Briefly, 25 ml of cell lysate containing His-tagged recombinant protein was mixed with 5 ml of nickel-Sepharose resin, which had been equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm imidazole and 500 mm NaCl (binding buffer) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After binding, the resin was packed in a column (1 × 10 cm) and washed to base line with binding buffer. The bound protein was eluted with 20 mm phosphate buffer containing 250 mm imidazole and 500 mm NaCl, and the elution was monitored at 280 nm. Fractions (2.0 ml) containing protein peak were pooled, dialyzed against PBS, and frozen at –20 °C until use. β-Glucosidase Aggregation Assays—Native β-glucosidase purified from maize inbred line K55 (33Cicek M.

In the pull-down assay, native β-glucosidase (58 nm) was incubated separately with increasing concentrations of native or rBGAF (0–100 nm), chimera (0–200 nm), truncated BGAFs (0–500 nm), and dirigent and JRL domains (0–1000 nm) in PBS, pH 7.4, in 200-μl reaction volumes in a microcentrifuge tube at room temperature for 2 h. After incubation, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. An aliquot (50 μl) was withdrawn from the supernatant and diluted 5 times with citrate phosphate buffer, pH 5.8. The remaining β-glucosidase activity in the supernatant was determined as described (14Culley D.E. Horovitz D. Hadwiger L.A. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 301-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and reported as percentage of remaining β-glucosidase activity with respect to control without BGAF. For gel shift assays, native β-glucosidase (58 nm) was incubated separately with BGAF (100 nm), Sbdirigent-ZmJRL chimera (200 nm), truncated BGAFs (500 nm), and dirigent and JRL domains (1000 nm) in a 200-μl reaction volume in PBS at room temperature for 2 h. After incubation, an aliquot (25 μl) was mixed with native PAGE sample buffer, loaded onto an 8% native gel, and electrophoresed. The β-glucosidase activity zones (bands) were visualized using the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-Gal (4-MUGlc) as described previously (13Blanchard D.J. Cicek M. Chen J. Esen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11895-11901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of the presence of sugar on aggregating activity, BGAF (14 nm) was first incubated with increasing concentrations of Gal and lactose (0–125 mm) in PBS, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 1 h. Following incubation, Glu1 (58 nm) was added and further incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After centrifugation, the β-glucosidase activity remaining in the supernatant was determined as described above. Competitive Binding Studies—The competitive effect of the dirigent and JRL domai"
https://openalex.org/W2025144147,"Reovirus shows considerable potential as an oncolytic agent for Ras-activated tumors and is currently in clinical trials. Here we ask whether such tumor cell lines can acquire resistance to reoviral oncolysis. We challenged human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells that carry a Ras mutation by prolonged exposure to reovirus, thereby yielding highly virus-resistant HTR1 cells. These cells are persistently infected with reovirus, exhibit high Ras activity and retain the original Ras gene mutation, showing that resistance to reovirus can be displayed in cells with active Ras. The HTR1 cells also exhibit reduced cellular cathepsin B activity, which normally contributes to viral entry and activation. Persistently infected HTR1 cells were not tumorigenic in vivo, whereas immunologically cured virus-free HTR1 cells were highly tumorigenic. Thus, acquisition of resistance to reovirus may constrain therapeutic strategies. To determine whether reoviral resistance is associated with a general reduction in apoptotic potential, we challenged the HTR1 cells with apoptotic inducers and E1B-defective adenovirus, resulting in significant apoptosis and cell death following both approaches. Therefore, even if resistance to reoviral oncolysis should arise in tumor cells in vivo, other therapeutic strategies may nevertheless remain effective."
https://openalex.org/W2083623111,"When cells are migrating, caveolin-1, the principal protein component of caveolae, is excluded from the leading edge and polarized at the cell rear. The dynamic feature depends on a specific sequence motif that directs intracellular trafficking of the protein. Deletion mutation analysis revealed a putative polarization domain at the N terminus of caveolin-1, between amino acids 32–60. Alanine substitution identified a minimal sequence of 10 residues (46TKEIDLVNRD55) necessary for caveolin-1 rear polarization. Interestingly, deletion of amino acids 1–60 did not prevent the polarization of caveolin-1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells or wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts because of an interaction of Cav61–178 mutant with endogenous caveolin-1. Surprisingly, expression of the depolarization mutant in caveolin-1 null cells dramatically impeded caveolae formation. Furthermore, knockdown of caveolae formation by methyl-β-cyclodextrin failed to prevent wild-type caveolin-1 rear polarization. Importantly, genetic depletion of caveolin-1 led to disoriented migration, which can be rescued by full-length caveolin-1 but not the depolarization mutant, indicating a role of caveolin-1 polarity in chemotaxis. Thus, we have identified a sequence motif that is essential for caveolin-1 rear polarization and caveolae formation.

Thus, we have identified a sequence motif that is essential for caveolin-1 rear polarization and caveolae formation. Caveolae are specific microdomains of the plasma membrane that were discovered more than 50 years ago (1Yamada E. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1955; 1: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, numerous vesicles appeared to derive from the uniformly flask-shaped invaginations, suggesting the endocytic potential of caveolae (2Palade G.E. J. Appl. Phys. 1953; 241424Google Scholar). Although the function of caveolae as transport vesicles mediating endocytosis and transcytosis remained obscure (3Severs N.J. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 341-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Parton R.G. Richards A.A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 724-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), the identification, cloning, and characterization of caveolar coat proteins, caveolins, has increased our knowledge of caveolae, and a good body of evidence implicates caveolae in a specialized form of delivery of membrane components, extracellular ligands, bacterial toxins, and nonenveloped virus in several cell types (5Chini B. Parenti M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 6Pagano R.E. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Kamen B.A. Rothberg K.G. Lacey S.W. Science. 1992; 255: 410-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The caveolae-mediated endocytic pathway differs from that mediated by clathrin-coated pits. It is sensitive to protein kinase C inhibitors and cholesterol depletion (by filipin), and in some cells it is involved in the activation of protein tyrosine kinases (9Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 116: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).

The mechanism controlling caveolae trafficking remains unclear, but it apparently involves both microtubule and actin cytoskeletons (10Mundy D.I. Machleidt T. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4327-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, using Cav-1 as a marker for caveolae, recent studies demonstrate that caveolae are rich in a variety of signaling molecules, with the implication that caveolae may function in the regulation of signal transduction. Given these views, an attractive hypothesis would be whether caveolae could carry signaling machinery to different locations of the cell to spatially organize signaling events. Indeed, Anderson and colleagues (11Isshiki M. Ando J. Yamamoto K. Fujita T. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 475-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown recently that concomitant with the relocation of caveolae, sites of Ca2+ wave initiation moved to the same location in migrating cells. Three mammalian caveolins, i.e. Cav-1, -2, and -3, have been identified and characterized (12Engelman J.A. Zhang X.L. Galbiati F. Volonte D. Sotgia F. Pestell R.G. Minetti C. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1578-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Whereas Cav-1 and -2 are co-expressed in many cell types, Cav-3 is limited to muscle (13Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2255-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Cloning and sequencing of Cav-1 cDNA showed that unlike clathrin, Cav-1 most likely is an integral membrane protein inserted into the membrane so that both the N and C termini of the protein are in the cytosol (16Spisni E. Tomasi V. Cestaro A. Tosatto S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have shown that caveolins interact with a variety of signaling molecules, and many of these caveolin-interacting proteins bear a common caveolin binding motif that is recognized by a 20-aa sequence (aa 82–101) proximal to the membrane insertion region. The simultaneous identification of Cav-1 as a caveolar membrane coat and as a component of detergent resistant trans-Golgi-derived vesicle (named VIP21, which stands for vesicular integral membrane protein of 21 kDa) implies that surface caveolin recycles between caveolae and the Golgi apparatus (18Conrad P.A. Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1421-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Furthermore, caveolins are implicated in polarized vesicular traffic in epithelia (19Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Fra A.M. Virta H. Simons K. Ikonen E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and in cholesterol transport (20Smart E. Ying Y.-S. Conrad P. Anderson R.G.W. J.

The intracellular trafficking apparently depends on a specific amino acid sequence in caveolin (22Machleidt T. Li W.P. Liu P. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Luetterforst R. Stang E. Zorzi N. Carozzi A. Way M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1443-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We and others have shown recently that caveolae and Cav-1 are polarized in migrating endothelial cells (11Isshiki M. Ando J. Yamamoto K. Fujita T. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 475-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Beardsley A. Fang K. Mertz H. Castranova V. Friend S. Liu J. J. Biol.

Cell. 2003; 14: 3156-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism underlying the asymmetrical distribution is not known. It is proposed that polarized caveolae and Cav-1 may play an important role in spatial organization of polarized signaling activity during cell migration, given the fact that caveolae are rich in signaling molecules and actively travel in cells upon stimulation. Indeed, depolarization of Cav-1 by targeted knockdown of the protein significantly impedes cell polarization and inhibits cell directional movement (24Beardsley A. Fang K. Mertz H. Castranova V. Friend S. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3541-3547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify specific sequence(s) or domain(s) that controls Cav-1 rear polarization in migrating cells, we generated mutant forms of Cav-1 fused to the reporter protein GFP and expressed them in cells lacking endogenous Cav-1. Here, we report the identification of a novel domain at the N terminus of Cav-1 that controls rear polarization of the protein as well as caveolae formation. Antibodies and Reagents—pEGFP-N1 and monoclonal antibody for Cav-1 were purchased from BD Biosciences. Protein A/G plus-agarose immunoprecipitation reagent, polyclonal antibodies for GFP and Cav-1 (N-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody was purchased from Sigma. Rhodamine Red-X-conjugated secondary antibody was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). BJ5183-AD-1 electroporation-competent cells and pAdTrack-CMV vector were generous gifts from Dr. Bert Vogelstein of The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. Cell culture reagents, Lipofectamine™ 2000, and Lipofectin reagent were purchased from Invitrogen. The bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit was purchased from Pierce. Cell Culture—Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from day 13.5 mouse embryos. Pregnant mice were sacrificed with CO2 asphyxiation. Embryos were decapitated, thoroughly minced, and trypsinized with 1 ml of 0.05% trypsin in 0.53 mm EDTA (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37 °C. Ten ml of complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) was used to inactivate the trypsin and resuspend the dissociated cells. Fibroblasts were plated on a 10-cm plate and cultured in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Early passages (passage <5) of primary MEFs were used for all experiments. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from the human umbilical vein and cultured as described previously (24Beardsley A. Fang K. Mertz H. Castranova V. Friend S. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3541-3547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 26Ashton A.W. Yokota R. John G. Zhao S. Suadicani S.O. Spray D.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol.

The cells were grown in MCDB131 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated human serum, 20% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum, 150 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, 5 units/ml heparin sodium, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—The full-length cDNA encoding Cav-1 or mutants was fused in-frame to the N terminus of GFP. EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends of murine Cav-1 cDNA by PCR using the TripleMaster® PCR system (Brinkmann Instruments, Inc.). A series of mutations in Cav-1 were generated by PCR from the cDNA of murine Cav-1 (see Fig. 1). The PCR products were subcloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pEGFP-N1 eukaryotic expression vector (Clontech). The orientation and sequence of Cav-1-GFP were verified by sequencing. Cholesterol Depletion—Cholesterol depletion was performed as described previously (27Westermann M. Steiniger F. Richter W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 123: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild-type MEFs were incubated with 0, 3, or 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% lipid-free FBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Then, the cells were replated onto 1 μg/ml fibronectin-precoated coverglass to allow migration. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were fixed for immunofluorescence co-staining with specific antibody for Cav-1 and paxillin or for transmission electron microscopy analysis. The percentage of Cav-1 polarization was calculated. Adenovirus Production, Amplification, and Purification—FLAG-tagged normal and mutant cDNA of Cav-1 were cloned into pAdTrack-CMV, and the resultant constructs were digested with PmeI and electrotransformed into BJ5183-AD-1-competent cells for recombination. The recombinant adenoviral constructs were purified, digested with PacI, and transfected into AD293 cells to produce the recombinant adenovirus. After 7–10 days, the primary adenovirus was generated. The recombinant adenoviruses were named AdCav1–178, AdCav61–178, and AdCav46–50A. AdCav1–178 expressed FLAG-tagged full-length Cav-1 (Cav1–178-FLAG), and AdCav61–178 expressed FLAG-tagged N-terminal deletion of Cav-1 (Cav61–178-FLAG). AdCav46–50A expressed Cav-1 with alanine substitution of aa 46–50. Upon reaching 90% confluency, AD293 cells were infected with the primary adenovirus. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Following incubation, the cells were collected and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) buffer. Three freeze/thaw cycles were performed at -20 °C (until completely frozen)/37 °C (until fully thawed). The debris was pelleted, and supernatant was collected for purification. The adenovirus was purified by sequential cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. After purification, the virus was desalted and stored at -80 °C. Chemotaxis Dunn Chamber Assay—Cav-1 null MEFs infected with AdCav1–178, AdCav61–178, or AdGFP were seeded on a glass coverslip coated with 0.2% gelatin and starved for 4 h prior to the assay. To set up gradient experiments, both concentric wells of the chamber were filled with starvation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.25% FBS), and a coverslip seeded with cells was inverted onto the chamber in an offset position leaving a narrow slit at one edge for refilling the outer well. The medium of the outer well was drained and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. For control experiments in which cells were subjected to uniform concentrations of chemoattractant, both wells were filled with medium containing 0.25% FBS. The Horizon Method of Analyzing Chemotaxis—Cells migrating over the annular bridge of the Dunn chamber were recorded using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal system with 10× objective. Differential interference contrast images were captured at 2-min intervals for a total of 6 h using Zeiss time-lapse software. Only cells migrating at least 20 μm were included in the calculation. The “horizon” distance was defined as the distance migrated from the starting position by 90% of the cells, a value determined arbitrarily to enable a highly stringent statistical test. Cell trajectories from three independent experiments were tracked manually and converted to a set of angular directions (28Zicha D. Dunn G. Jones G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 75: 449-457PubMed Google Scholar). These angles were displayed in a circular histogram where the length of each 18° segment represented the total number of cells with an average angle of migration falling within that particular interval. The Rayleigh test for unimodal clustering of directions was used to determine whether there was a significant chemotactic response (28Zicha D. Dunn G. Jones G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 75: 449-457PubMed Google Scholar). A uniform distribution (random cell motility) of data was assumed if the p value for the calculation was greater than 0.05. The mean direction is displayed as an arrow and the 95% confidence interval as a gray arc (Fig. 8A). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells expressing GFP-tagged normal or mutant forms of Cav-1 were plated on 0.2% gelatin-coated glass coverslips to allow migration, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at 22 °C, and then either mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech Inc.) directly or permeabilized with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min at 22 °C. The permeabilized cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 22 °C and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h followed by rhodamine Red-X-conjugated secondary antibody. Fluorescence images of the cells were acquired on an upright Carl Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with C-Apochromat 40×/1.2 W water-immersion objective using the 488 nm line of an argon laser and/or the 543 nm line of a HeNe laser at 25 °C. Cell borders were outlined from differential interference contrast images. Images of 30–40 polarized cells expressing Cav-1-GFP were randomly recorded. Green fluorescence intensity in six regions (three at the cell front and three at the cell rear; see Fig. 2B) of each cell was measured using Image J software. Cav-1 depolarization was assumed if a ratio of rear-to-front fluorescence intensity was equal to or less than the cells expressing GFP. If a ratio of rear-to-front fluorescence intensity of a Cav-1 mutant was significantly higher than the cells expressing GFP but less than wild-type Cav-1 (Cav1–178-GFP), a partial polarization was assumed. We have shown that loss of Cav-1 polarity affects cell polarization (24Beardsley A. Fang K. Mertz H. Castranova V. Friend S. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3541-3547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the present study, we focused only on the polarized subpopulation of the cells to determine the polarity of Cav-1 mutants (see “Results”). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Cav61–178-GFP or Cav61–178-FLAG was expressed in Cav-1-/- MEFs, and the cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 60 mm octylglucoside, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors. The lysates were precleared and immunoprecipitated with polyclonal GFP antibodies or monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibodies at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were boiled for 4 min in Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted against Cav-1. Bands were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Purification of Caveolin-rich Membrane Domains—Caveolin-rich membrane domains were isolated as described previously (29Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). In brief, confluent cells were scraped into sodium carbonate (pH 11.0) and homogenized. The resulting homogenate was mixed with the same volume of 90% sucrose in MES-buffered saline, which was overlaid by 35 and 5% sucrose in MES-buffered saline. The gradient was then centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16 h in an SW41 rotor, and then 12 fractions of 1 ml in each were collected, starting from the top of the gradient, for immunoblot analysis. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Cav-1-/- MEFs were infected with or without AdCav1–178 or AdCav61–178. Twenty-four hours post-infection, cells were seeded onto gelatin-coated dishes, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer, and scraped into a microcentrifuge tube. The samples were post-fixed with osmium tetroxide and then embedded in epon. The sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Thin sections of samples were examined under a JEOL 1220 transmission electron microscope. Deletion of aa 1–60 at the N Terminus Prevents Rear Polarization of Caveolin-1—Upon cell migration, Cav-1 is excluded from the leading edge and polarized to the cell rear. On the basis of previous extensive studies to identify domains that dictate caveolin intracellular trafficking, we reasoned that when cells are stimulated to migrate, Cav-1 moves to the rear of migrating cells in a sequence-specific fashion as a mechanism to sequester it away from signaling proteins that direct lamellipod protrusion. To determine the amino acid sequence that is necessary for Cav-1 polarization, we started by generating a series of caveolin-1 mutants by deletion mutations across the molecule, because this strategy had been used successfully to characterize domains for caveolar membrane targeting and intracellular trafficking (22Machleidt T. Li W.P. Liu P. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Luetterforst R. Stang E. Zorzi N. Carozzi A. Way M. Parton R.G. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22660-22667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To assess the trafficking of Cav-1 mutants, we chose Cav-1-/- cells that were deficient in endogenous Cav-1 and would not sequester the mutants and keep them from depolarizing (see Fig. 3). The deletion mutants used in the present study include Cav32–178, Cav61–178, and Cav1–156 (Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that deletion of aa 60–80 results in trapping the molecule in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas deletion of either aa 80–100 or 134–154 leads to co-localization with a Golgi marker (22Machleidt T. Li W.P. Liu P. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, Cav-1 mutants that have been shown previously to sort improperly after expression were excluded from the present study. Wild-type and mutant Cav-1 generated as GFP fusion proteins were transiently expressed in Cav-1-/- MEFs and detected in a punctate pattern on the plasma membrane and, to a lesser extent, in the perinuclear regions (apparently the Golgi apparatus) in stationary cells (data not shown). Our previous study showed that targeted knockdown of Cav-1 using Cav-1 siRNA (small interfering RNA) impeded human endothelial cell polarization by 3-fold and inhibited cell directional movement (24Beardsley A. Fang K. Mertz H. Castranova V. Friend S. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3541-3547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This result was confirmed by our recent study demonstrating a dramatic decrease in the number of polarized mouse pulmonary endothelial cells from 32 ± 3.8% in wild-type cells to 16 ± 3.5% in Cav-1-/- cells (p < 0.01), suggesting that Cav-1 polarity plays an important role in cell polarization. Although the number of polarized cells was dramatically reduced, some Cav-1 depolarized cells were able to polarize, suggesting that Cav-1 depolarization was not sufficient to completely block cell polarization. Thus, we expected that ectopic expression of full-length Cav-1 in Cav-1-/- cells would restore cell polarization and that expression of Cav-1 mutants would impede cell polarization and, subsequently, the polarity of the Cav-1 mutants. Therefore, in the present study, we focused only on the polarized subpopulation of cells to determine the polarity of Cav-1 mutants. Consistent with previous observations (24Beardsley A. Fang K. Mertz H. Castranova V. Friend S. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3541-3547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Parat M.O. Anand-Apte B. Fox P.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3156-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), Cav1–178-GFP polarized at the rear of migrating Cav-1-/- MEFs (Fig. 2A, a), suggesting that exogenously expressed Cav-1 behaves as endogenous protein and is able to polarize in Cav-1-deficient cells. Deletion of aa 1–31 retained Cav-1 rear polarity. In contrast, deletion of aa 1–60 (Cav61–178-GFP) prevented rear polarization of the protein, and instead signals of the mutant were detected at the leading edge (Fig. 2A, d), suggesting that aa 32–60 are necessary for Cav-1 polarization. To assess whether the C-terminal domain plays a role in Cav-1 polarization, Cav-1-/- MEFs were transfected with a Cav-1 mutant lacking the final 22 amino acids (Cav1–156-GFP). As shown in Fig. 2A, c, the mutant polarized at the cell rear. In addition, weak signals were detected at the cell front, suggesting a partial polarization of the mutant. To analyze the polarized Cav-1-GFP signal statistically in migrating cells, fluorescence intensity in six regions (three at the cell front and three at the cell rear; see Fig. 2B) was detected, and a ratio of rear-to-front fluorescence intensity was determined in each mutant (n ≥ 30) (see “Experimental Procedures”) and compared with GFP only. Statistical analysis revealed that the ratio of rear-to-front fluorescence intensity in Cav1–178-GFP- or Cav32–178-GFP-expressing cells was 2.6- or 2.3-fold more than that in GFP, respectively (p < 0.0001; Table 1, Fig. 2C), suggesting that deletion of the first 31 aa at the N terminus does not affect the polarity of the protein. In contrast, deletion of an additional 29 aa dramatically reduced the fluorescence intensity ratio to the level of GFP, suggesting loss of polarity (Fig. 2C). The fluorescence intensity ratio in Cav1–156-GFP was 1.6-fold higher than GFP (p < 0.01) but 1.6-fold lower than Cav1–178-GFP (p < 0.01), indicating partial polarization (Table 1; Fig. 2C). The effect of deletion mutation on Cav-1 polarization was not due to protein expression levels (Fig. 2E).TABLE 1Student's t test analysis of the fluorescence intensity of Cav-1 deletion mutantsConstructp value compared with Cav1–178-GFPp value compared with GFPCav1–178-GFP6.640 × 10–9Cav32–178-GFP0.2761.540 × 10–6Cav61–178-GFP8.858 × 10–90.724Cav1–156-GFP2.016 × 10–45.407 × 10–5 Open table in a new tab The number of Cav-1-polarized cells expressing each construct was determined by comparing the ratio of rear-to-front fluorescence intensity in each mutant with that of GFP. As described above, we focused only on the polarized subpopulation of the cells. Polarization of a Cav-1 mutant was assumed if fluorescence intensity ratio of the mutant was more than 2 S.D. of the mean of GFP. Fig. 2D shows that 79.5 ± 5.7% of morphologically polarized cells expressing full-length Cav-1 display Cav-1 rear polarization. In contrast, up to 8.8 ± 0.25% of polarized cells expressing Cav61–178-GFP show rear polarization. The number of Cav-1 rear polarization cells is 44 ± 5.5% of polarized cells expressing the partial polarity mutant, Cav1–156-GFP. Cav61–178-GFP Regains Polarity by Interacting with Endogenous Caveolin-1—Cav-1 exists as a high molecular mass in living cells, which is mediated by the oligomer domain, aa 61–101 (33Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). It is possible that expression of the depolarization mutant Cav61–178-GFP would affect the localization of endogenous Cav-1 in a migrating cell. To test this hypothesis, we expressed Cav61–178-GFP in either HUVECs or wild-type MEFs known to express Cav-1 and examined the localization of endogenous Cav-1 using polyclonal antibody for Cav-1 (the antibody recognizes an epitope at the N terminus of Cav-1 and does not react with our depolarization mutant). Fig. 3A shows that the depolarization mutant Cav-1 is co-localized with endogenous Cav-1, and interestingly, the mutant is polarized together with wild-type Cav-1 at the cell rear. This result suggests that the mutant may be trapped and co-translocated with endogenous Cav-1 to the rear of migrating cells. To assess whether the mutant interacted with endogenous Cav-1, wild-type MEFs were transfected with or without the depolarization construct expressing Cav61–178-GFP and subjected to immunoprecipitation with specific antibody for GFP.

Thus, PACAP is an important slow transmitter at the adrenomedullary synapse that stimulates catecholamine and neuropeptide release and maintains adequate levels of hormones for the prolonged secretion associated with sustained metabolic or psychogenic stress (13Hamelink C.

PACAP fulfills a similar function at postganglionic sympathetic synapses, enhancing the expression as well as the release of neuropeptides through engagement of multiple signaling pathways, including inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and cAMP (16Beaudet M.M.

The actions of PACAP in the sympathoadrenal axis are mediated mainly through its G-protein-coupled receptor, PAC1. Several PAC1 variants exist in neurons and endocrine cells, which differ at the N terminus and in the third intracellular loop (IC3) of this G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). N-terminal splice variants show slightly different affinities for PACAP binding but similar G-protein-coupling properties (20Pantaloni C. Brabet P. Bilanges B. Dumuis A. Houssami S. Spengler D.

Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 11: 941-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). IC3 variants originate from the alternative splicing of neither, one, or both of two exons, hip or hop, within this region (22Spengler D. Bweber C. Pantaloni C. Hlsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 23Pisegna J.R. Wank S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17267-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). All variants, including PAC1null, which has neither hop nor hip insertions in IC3, bind PACAP-38 and PACAP-27 with high affinity and couple to Gs to activate adenylate cyclase (AC) (22Spengler D. Bweber C. Pantaloni C. Hlsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 23Pisegna J.R. Wank S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17267-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Insertion of the hip cassette in the PAC1 receptor either abolishes or impairs coupling to phospholipase C (PLC) when these receptors are expressed in the nonneuroendocrine LLC-PK1 (LLC-PK1, pig kidney epithelial) or NIH3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblast) cell lines (22Spengler D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17267-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Human PAC1hop and PAC1null receptors couple to both AC and PLC in the Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO) commonly used for receptor reconstitution; however, PAC1hop uniquely binds to other signaling molecules, at least in these cells, that could explain differential signaling between the two receptor variants (24McCulloch D.A.

Finally, a rat PAC1 variant consisting of an amino acid substitution in transmembrane region two and a two-amino acid deletion with a two-amino acid substitution in transmembrane region four has been reported to mediate Ca2+ influx in CHO cells, without coupling to AC (26Chatterjee T.K. Sharma R.V. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32226-32232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), although the existence of this variant in other species is in doubt (14Mustafa T. Eiden L.E. Handbook of Neurochemistry and Molecular Neurobiology: Neuroactive Peptides and Proteins, Springer, Heidelberg. 2006; : 463-498Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, the structural basis for PAC1 receptor coupling to cytosolic Ca2+ mobilization and extracellular influx in neuronal and endocrine cells remains unresolved, significantly impeding progress in understanding this crucial aspect of class II GPCR-Ca2+ coupling. Determining receptor variant specificity unambiguously with respect to second messenger coupling is key to understanding the mechanisms of PACAP-evoked exocytosis, since stimulation of exocytosis by PACAP and other neurotransmitters may be modulated by cAMP and interactions between cAMP and Ca2+ in addition to the required rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) that triggers the final step of exocytosis (27Eiden L.E. Bradshaw R. Dennis E. Handbook of Cell Signaling Academic Press, Inc., New York, Signaling during Exocytosis. 2003: 375-392Google Scholar). PACAP-mediated secretion from bovine chromaffin cells (BCCs) and rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells is reported to require Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs), with predominant contributions from either L-type or non-L-type channels depending on the time frame of secretion and the type of cell (1O'Farrell M.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 956-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), pathways that may also contribute to Ca2+ influx required for exocytosis. PAC1 receptor activation could therefore stimulate secretion both directly and indirectly through Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores, Ca2+ influx, and cAMP generation. Evidence for PACAP coupling to these second messengers through PAC1 comes from a variety of endocrine and nonendocrine cells, however, and may be specific to both the cell type and receptor variant. Therefore, identifying the mechanism of secretion triggered by PACAP at the adrenomedullary synapse, at which PACAP is the major physiologically relevant slow transmitter, requires (a) identification of the PAC1 variant or variants present in chromaffin cells, (b) reconstitution of PACAP-dependent calcium signaling and secretory competence in a neuroendocrine cell background, and (c) determination of the structural motifs responsible for reconstituted signaling leading to secretion. We demonstrate here that BCCs express a single PACAP receptor, bPAC1hop, and reveal the structural requirements for coupling to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, Ca2+ influx, and neurosecretion through reconstitution in PC12-G cells. Materials—PACAP-38 and PACAP-27 were purchased from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals (Mountain View, CA). The radioligand, [125I]PACAP-27 (specific activity 2200 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Tetrodotoxin (TTX), veratridine, and forskolin were purchased from Calbiochem-EMD Biosciences. All tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen unless otherwise specified. All other reagents used were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Chromaffin Cell Cultures—Steer adrenal glands were used to isolate chromaffin cells as previously described (37Eiden L.E. Giraud P. Affolter H-U. Herbert E. Hotchkiss A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3949-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 38Fenwick E.M. Fajdiga P.B. Howe N.B.S. Livett B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 76: 12-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated chromaffin cells were seeded into 162-cm2 tissue culture flasks and cultured for 24 h in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 25 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside (chromaffin cell complete medium; CCCM) with 100 units/ml nystatin prior to differential plating into 24-well plates. For radioimmunoassays, chromaffin cells were replated at a density of 500,000 cells/well on 0.1 mg/ml poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well plates (Costar-Corning) 24 h prior to treatments or harvesting. Measurement of Met-Enkephalin Release—Release studies were performed on chromaffin cells 24 h after differential plating. Briefly, cells were pretreated for 30 min with 500 μl of CCCM containing 30 μm D600, 1 μm TTX, 10 μm nimodipine, vehicle, or Ca2+-free CCCM (Ca2+ concentration from serum alone, ∼100 μm). A further 500 μl of CCCM or Ca2+-free CCCM, either with or without 200 nm PACAP-38 or 20 μm veratridine, was then added to each well containing each of the above inhibitors, resulting in a final concentration of 100 nm PACAP or 10 μm veratridine/1000-μl final well volume. Following 1 h of treatment, Met-enkephalin was assayed from medium aliquots or 0.1 n HCl-lyophilized cell extracts by radioimmunoassay (37Eiden L.E. Giraud P. Affolter H-U. Herbert E. Hotchkiss A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3949-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The statistical difference between control and treatment groups was determined using one-way analysis of variance by Tukey’s multiple comparison test using GRAPHPAD PRISM, version 4 (GraphPad Software). Preparation of cDNA—Bovine chromaffin, NG108-15, or PC12-G cells grown in Costar 162-cm2 flasks (Corning) were harvested, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, rapidly resuspended in Trizol (Invitrogen), snap-frozen, and stored at -80 °C. Total RNA was then isolated using the RNeasy® Mini total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with the following modifications. Samples were thawed on ice and extracted with a final concentration of 20% chloroform. Following centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, an equal volume of 70% ethanol was added to the aqueous phase, and the sample was applied to the RNeasy® Mini spin column and processed according to Ref. 69Inc Qiagen RNeasy® Mini Handbook. 2001; (Qiagen Inc.): 31-35Google Scholar. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using the Superscript™ First-Strand Synthesis System according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription-PCR reactions were carried out using 1 μl(∼250 ng) of the first-strand cDNA synthesis reaction as described below. Identification and Cloning of the BCC PAC1 Receptor—The previously published sequence of the cloned bovine brain PAC1 receptor (accession number D17290) (39Miyamoto Y. Habata Y. Ohtaki T. Masuda Y. Ogi K. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was used to design a series of primers to amplify the receptor in overlapping segments and test for splice variants as described in Fig. 3. Primers (5′-ATGAGAGGCGGGCGGCACTG-3′ and 5′-CCAACTGTGTACAGGGCCTTCACTG-3′) were used to isolate the N-terminal region of the PAC1 receptor. The entire transmembrane 1–7 region, including the third intracellular loop known to contain inserts, was amplified using primers (5′-GCCCTGTACACAGTTGGCTACA-3′ and 5′-TTGATCTCCGCCTGCACCTC-3′). The C terminus of the receptor was finally amplified using primers (5′-AGAGGTGCAGGCGGAGATCA-3′ and 5′-TCAGGTGGCCAGGTTGTCGG-3′), resulting in the generation of three overlapping amplicons representing the full-length PAC1 receptor. To further investigate the presence of third intracellular loop variants containing either hip, hop, or hiphop cassette insertions, transmembrane region 5–6 was amplified with primers (5′-GGCCCTGTAGTTGGCTCCATAATGG-3′ and 5′-GGGAGAAAGCAAAGACAGTG-3′). To determine which cassette was present in the IC3 region located between TM regions 5 and 6, the TM5 forward primer (5′-GGCCCTGTAGTTGGCTCCATAATGG-3′) was used in combination with reverse primers designed to anneal within the bovine hop (5′-AGAGTAATGGTGGACAGTTCTGACA-3′) or rat hip (5′-AGGAAAGGGGGTGAATGCTG-3′) cassettes. All PCRs contained a 0.25 μm concentration of each primer, 1 mm dNTPs, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 units of high fidelity Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and ∼250 ng of cDNA template. Amplification consisted of an initial denaturation step of 95 °C for 5 min followed by 36 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min with a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. The entire open reading frame of the bovine PAC1 receptor was obtained using primers (5′-ATGAGAGGCGGGCGGCACTG-3′ and 5′-TCAGGTGGCCAGGTTGTCGG-3′) under the PCR conditions specified above. The amplified bovine chromaffin PAC1 receptor cDNA was then directly cloned into the pCR®II-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Recombinant plasmids containing the entire open reading frame (ORF) or various segments of the receptor were sequenced using M13 reverse and M13 forward primers by the dideoxy chain termination method (DNA Sequencing Facility, NINDS, National Institutes of Health). Following multiple sequence verification, the bovine chromaffin cell PAC1 receptor cDNA was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3, and used for all subsequent studies. Removal of the Hop Cassette—The entire hop cassette was removed from the bovine PAC1 receptor using PCR-mediated deletion mutagenesis based on a previously described method (40Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lee J. Lee H.J. Shin M.K. Ryu W.S. BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 398-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, first round PCR was carried out using one chimeric and one nonchimeric primer to amplify the upstream and downstream regions immediately surrounding the hop cassette to be deleted. The PCR amplicons were then diluted 1:1000, and 1 μl of the upstream and downstream amplicons were combined and used as template for a second round of ligation PCR using the outermost primer pairs (forward primer, 5′-TGAATGAGAGGCGGGCGGCA-3′; reverse primer, 5-GGCTCAGGTGGCCAGGTTGT-3′). PCRs were carried out according to the conditions described above. The final single amplicon was purified and cloned into pcDNA3, and deletion of the hop cassette was confirmed through multiple sequencing reactions. Cell Culture—NG108-15 cells (rat neuroblastoma × mouse glioma) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were cultured in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 1× HAT (sodium hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine) supplement. PC12-G rat pheochromocytoma cells (42Rausch D.M. Iacangelo A.L. Eiden L.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) were cultured in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 7% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 7% horse serum (Bio-Whittaker-Cambrex, Walkersville, MD), 25 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. All cells were used between passages 6 and 30. Stable and Transient Transfection Studies—NG108-15 cells were transfected (24-well plate, 2-cm2 surface area) with a mixture of 0.8 μg of DNA (pcDNA3 alone; pcDNA3 containing the bovine PAC1 receptor (bPAC1hop) cDNA; pcDNA3 containing the bovine PAC1 receptor deletion mutant (bPAC1null) cDNA; or pRT43.2, a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven GFP reporter plasmid, and 2 μl of Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen) in the absence of serum according to the manufacturer’s instructions). For creation of bPAC1hop stable cell lines, NG108-15 cells were transfected with PvuI (New England Biolabs)-linearized pcDNA3 containing bPAC1hop receptor cDNA as described above. Cells were then selected using 500 μg/ml G418 and continuously maintained in 300 μg/ml G418 thereafter. Stable cell lines were screened through receptor binding studies and selected based on their ability to bind [125I]PACAP-27 compared with mock-transfected NG108-15 cells. PC12-G cells were transfected (24-well plate, 2-cm2 surface area) with 1 μg of DNA as specified above and 2 μl of Lipofectamine2000™ (Invitrogen) in the presence of serum according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For creation of stable cell lines, PC12-G cells were transfected with linearized plasmid as described above and selected and continuously maintained using 500 μg/ml G418. PC12-G cells stably expressing the bPAC1hop receptor were selected based on gain of [125I]PACAP-27 binding and Ca2+ mobilization compared with mock-transfected naive PC12-G cells. All transiently transfected cells were assayed 48 h post-transfection, whereas stable cell lines were plated 24 h prior to experimentation. Preparation of Crude Cell Membranes—Crude membranes were prepared as previously described (43Mustafa T. Chai S.Y. Mendelsohn F.A. Moeller I. Albiston A.L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1679-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent cells were harvested in hypotonic buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl and 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), homogenized with a hand-held tissue homogenizer (Tissuemizer; Fisher Scientific) for 10 s, and centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 20 min, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in PACAP wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) supplemented with Roche cocktail inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science). Total protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein colorimetric assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad). Receptor Binding Studies—NG108-15 or PC12-G cell membranes (30 μg) were incubated in the presence of 150 pm [125I]PACAP-27 and increasing concentrations of unlabeled PACAP-38, PACAP-27, and VIP in PACAP binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml bacitracin, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm aprotinin, and 1% bovine serum albumin) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. All assays were set up and incubated in Multiscreen™ glass fiber plates (Millipore), precoated for 2 h at 4 °C with 0.1% polyethyleneimine prepared in PACAP wash buffer as described above. Free and bound radioligand were then separated by filtration using the multiscreen vacuum manifold according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plates were washed four times with ice-cold PACAP wash buffer, filters were punched, and the retained radioactivity was measured on a γ-counter. The radioligand binding data were analyzed using version 4 of the GRAPHPAD PRISM program. Intracellular cAMP Measurements—Stably transfected NG108-15 cells were plated onto 24-well plates (Costar-Corning) coated with poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) at a density of 70,000 cells/well 24 h prior to being serum-deprived for 24 h. For transient transfection studies, cells were plated at a density of 70,000 cells/well 24 h post-transfection according to the conditions described above and serum-deprived 24 h prior to treatments. The NG108-15 cells were then treated with varying concentrations (10-7 to 10-11 m) of PACAP-38, PACAP-27, or VIP for 20 min at 37 °C in DMEM containing 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, 1× HAT supplement, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Intracellular cAMP was then measured using the Biotrak nonacetylation enzyme immunoassay system with the supplied lysis reagent according to manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham Biosciences). 24 h post-transfection, PC12-G cells were plated into 24-well plates coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine at a density of 250,000 cells/well, allowed to adhere for 24 h, and then treated with varying concentrations (10-7 to 10-11 m) of PACAP-38, PACAP-27, or VIP for 20 min at 37 °C. Intracellular cAMP content was determined as described above. Single Cell [Ca2+]i Measurements—[Ca2+]i was measured as previously described (44Grimaldi M. Maratos M. Verma A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4737-4745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 150,000 (NG108-15) or 400,000 (PC12-G) cells were seeded onto 1.5-cm diameter glass coverslips (Assistent) coated with 0.5 mg/ml poly-l-lysine in 12-well plates (Costar-Corning). Transiently transfected cells were plated 24 h post-transfection at the cell densities specified above. For transient transfection studies, cells were cotransfected at a ratio of 1:3 (bPAC1hop or bPAC1null in pcDNA3:pRT43.2GFP) in 162-cm2 flasks and plated 24 h post-transfection under the specified conditions. 24 h postseeding, cells were washed once with Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB) containing 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. The cells were then loaded with 4 μm Fura-2/AM (Invitrogen) in KRB for 22 min at room temperature. Following loading, cells were washed once with KRB and incubated for a further 22 min at room temperature in Fura-2/AM-free KRB. The coverslips were then mounted onto"
https://openalex.org/W2072212530,"We have used microarray technology to identify the transcriptional targets of Rho subfamily guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP)ases in NIH3T3 cells. This analysis indicated that murine fibroblasts transformed by these proteins show similar transcriptomal profiles. Functional annotation of the regulated genes indicate that Rho subfamily GTPases target a wide spectrum of functions, although loci encoding proteins linked to proliferation and DNA synthesis/transcription are upregulated preferentially. Rho proteins promote four main networks of interacting proteins nucleated around E2F, c-Jun, c-Myc and p53. Of those, E2F, c-Jun and c-Myc are essential for the maintenance of cell transformation. Inhibition of Rock, one of the main Rho GTPase targets, leads to small changes in the transcriptome of Rho-transformed cells. Rock inhibition decreases c-myc gene expression without affecting the E2F and c-Jun pathways. Loss-of-function studies demonstrate that c-Myc is important for the blockage of cell-contact inhibition rather than for promoting the proliferation of Rho-transformed cells. However, c-Myc overexpression does not bypass the inhibition of cell transformation induced by Rock blockage, indicating that c-Myc is essential, but not sufficient, for Rock-dependent transformation. These results reveal the complexity of the genetic program orchestrated by the Rho subfamily and pinpoint protein networks that mediate different aspects of the malignant phenotype of Rho-transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2112957187,"Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) is a phospholipase A2 that inactivates potent lipid messengers, such as PAF and modified phospholipids generated in settings of oxidant stress. The catalytic activity of PAF-AH is sensitive to oxidants, a feature that may have pathological consequences. We report that peroxynitrite, an oxidant species generated after cellular activation, mediates oxidative inactivation of PAF-AH. We found that peroxynitrite inactivated and derivatized the recombinant protein and obtained evidence supporting a role for a methionine and two tyrosine residues in this process. We employed interspecies comparisons and site-directed mutagenesis and identified a role for M-117, and a smaller contribution of Y-307 and Y-335 as targets of oxidant attack using free and lipoprotein-associated recombinant proteins. M-117 is adjacent to W-115 and L-116, which are essential for association of PAF-AH with LDL. Oxidation of LDL-associated PAF-AH partially dissociated the enzyme from the particles. Similarly, oxidation of the purified enzyme in the absence of lipoproteins prevented subsequent association with LDL. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that mediate inactivation of PAF-AH in settings of oxidant stress and the consequences of oxidation on the ability of this enzyme to associate with LDL."
https://openalex.org/W2029736072,"ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) is a regulatory kinase that, when activated by hydroxyurea, UV, or human immunodeficiency virus-1 Vpr, causes cell cycle arrest through Chk1-Ser345 phosphorylation. We demonstrate here that of these three agents only Vpr requires protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) to activate ATR for Chk1-Ser345 phosphorylation. A requirement for PP2A by Vpr was first shown with the PP2A-specific inhibitor okadaic acid, which reduced Vpr-induced G2 arrest and Cdk1-Tyr15 phosphorylation. Using small interference RNA to down-regulate specific subunits of PP2A indicated that the catalytic β-isoform PP2A(Cβ) and the A regulatory α-isoform PP2A(Aα) are involved in the G2 induction, and these downregulations decreased the Vpr-induced, ATR-dependent phosphorylations of Cdk1-Tyr15 and Chk1-Ser345. In contrast, the same down-regulations had no effect on hydroxyurea- or UV-activated ATR-dependent Chk1-Ser345 phosphorylation. Vpr and hydroxyurea/UV all induce ATR-mediated γH2AX-Ser139 phosphorylation and foci formation, but down-regulation of PP2A(Aα) or PP2A(Cβ) did not decrease γH2AX-Ser139 phosphorylation by any of these agents or foci formation by Vpr. Conversely, H2AX down-regulation had little effect on PP2A(Aα/Cβ)-mediated G2 arrest and Chk1-Ser345 phosphorylation by Vpr. The expression of vpr increases the amount and phosphorylation of Claspin, an activator of Chk1 phosphorylation. Down-regulation of either PP2A(Cβ) or PP2A(Aα) had little effect on Claspin phosphorylation, but the amount of Claspin was reduced. Claspin may then be one of the phosphoproteins through which PP2A(Aα/Cβ) affects Chk1 phosphorylation when ATR is activated by human immunodeficiency virus-1 Vpr. ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) is a regulatory kinase that, when activated by hydroxyurea, UV, or human immunodeficiency virus-1 Vpr, causes cell cycle arrest through Chk1-Ser345 phosphorylation.

To ensure accurate transmission of genetic information, eukaryotic cells have developed an elaborate network of checkpoints to monitor the successful completion of every cell cycle step and to respond to cellular abnormalities such as DNA damage and replication inhibition as they arise during cell proliferation. The ATR kinase, a member of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase-related kinase family (1Shechter D. Costanzo V. Gautier J. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), is a central regulator for the replication checkpoint that is induced by treatment with DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU). 2The abbreviations used are: HU, hydroxyurea; PP2A, protein phosphatase type 2A; OA, okadaic acid; siRNA, specific small interference RNA; Adv, adenovirus vector; NOC, nocodazole; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; p.i., post-infection; p.t., post-transfection; Cdk, cyclindependent kinase; ATR, ATM and Rad3-related; RPA, replication protein A. When ATR is activated, it initiates a regulatory cascade of phosphorylation events. One of the intermediate steps in this cascade is the activating phosphorylation of the Chk1 effector kinase (2Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). This activated Chk1 in turn phosphorylates and inactivates the Cdc25 phosphatases. Cdc25 phosphatases control the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases by removing the inhibitory phosphates on Tyr15 and Thr14 (1Shechter D. Costanzo V. Gautier J. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Specifically for the G2 to M transition, which is controlled by activation of Cdk1, activation of ATR leads to inactivation of the Cdc25 phosphatases, in particular Cdc25C (3Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar), ultimately resulting in the persistence of the phosphorylated Tyr15 and Thr14 on Cdk1, which causes a G2 arrest (4Boutros R. Dozier C. Ducommun B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). ATR can be activated by many agents including HU, which blocks replication, and DNA damaging agents such as UV and ionizing radiation. The agents capable of activating ATR share the common property of generating long single-stranded DNA regions either by blocking DNA replication, such as occurs with HU, to give stalled replication forks or by nuclease processing of the initial DNA damage (5Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 792-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The signal thought to activate ATR comes from the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA (replication protein A), which coats these abnormally long regions of single-stranded DNA (6Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2050) Google Scholar). A number of other factors, such as ATRIP, Rad1, Rad9, Hus1, and Rad17, are thought to play various roles in activating ATR at these RPA-coated regions (1Shechter D. Costanzo V. Gautier J. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 5Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 792-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The actual mechanism of ATR activation does not appear to involve phosphorylation or any other covalent modification of ATR, and in vitro assays of immunoprecipitated ATR before and after activation generally do not show an increase in activity (7Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Cell. 2004; 118: 9-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Instead of a covalent modification, most models propose that the principal mechanism of activation is the formation of macromolecular assembles bringing substrates in close proximity to ATR. If these macromolecular assemblies are large enough, they can be visualized as foci in the nucleus by immunofluorescence. For example, ATR and RPA form nuclear foci in response to HU or UV (8Zhang J. Bao S. Furumai R. Kucera K.S. Ali A. Dean N.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9910-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and these foci may represent the initial formation of macromolecular complexes where substrates are brought to be phosphorylated by ATR. Recently an alternative to this model of ATR activation by relocalization has been proposed. Kumagai et al. (9Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) showed that direct binding of TopBP1 was sufficient to activate ATR and proposed that this transient association with TopBP1 is the initial step in activation of ATR (9Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). HIV-1 Vpr protein has recently been shown to be another agent that induces a G2 arrest through ATR (10Roshal M. Kim B. Zhu Y. Nghiem P. Planelles V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25879-25886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Early results showed that Vpr induces cell cycle G2 arrest through inhibitory Tyr15 phosphorylation of Cdk1 in mammalian and yeast cells, suggesting that this viral protein exerts a highly conserved effect on a basic cellular function (11He J. Choe S. Walker R. Di Marzio P. Morgan D.O. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6705-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 12Re F. Braaten D. Franke E.K. Luban J. J.

Consistent with an ATR pathway, the inhibitory Tyr15 phosphorylation of Cdk1 is achieved by inhibition of Cdc25 phosphatase (14Elder R.T. Yu M. Chen M. Zhu X. Yanagida M. Zhao Y.

Further studies have shown numerous similarities between the ATR pathway activated by Vpr and by other agents such as HU and UV. These similarities include a requirement for Rad17 and Hus1 (17Zimmerman E.S. Chen J. Andersen J.L. Ardon O. Dehart J.L. Blackett J. Choudhary S.K. Camerini D. Nghiem P. Planelles V. Mol. Cell.

The variant histone H2AX is a protein commonly used to monitor the nuclear foci formed during DNA damage and replication checkpoints. In response to replication arrest or many forms of DNA damage, H2AX is phosphorylated on Ser139 to form γH2AX foci, and this phosphorylation is dependent on one or more phosphoinositide-3-kinase-related kinase including ATR (19Stucki M. Jackson S.P. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The γH2AX foci have been shown to retain DNA repair factors at the site of DNA damage, and it has been suggested that one of the roles of γH2AX is to concentrate DNA repair factors at sites of DNA damage (20Fernandez-Capetillo O. Lee A. Nussenzweig M. Nussenzweig A. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 21Furuta T. Takemura H. Liao Z.Y. Aune G.J. Redon C. Sedelnikova O.A. Pilch D.R.

Recently, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been shown to be recruited to DNA damage foci by binding to γH2AX (22Chowdhury D. Keogh M.C. Ishii H. Peterson C.L. Buratowski S. Lieberman J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Chowdhury et al. (22Chowdhury D. Keogh M.C. Ishii H. Peterson C.L. Buratowski S. Lieberman J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) proposed that the role of the PP2A at the γH2AX foci was to dephosphorylate γH2AX during recovery after DNA repair had been completed. PP2A is one of the major Ser/Thr phosphatases implicated in the regulation of many cellular processes including regulation of signal transduction pathways, cell cycle progression, DNA replication, gene transcription, and protein translation (23Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 24Zolnierowicz S. Biochem.

Van Hoof C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The PP2A holozyme is composed of a 36-kDa catalytic C subunit (PP2A(C)), a 65-kDa scaffolding A subunit (PP2A(A) or PR65), and a regulatory B subunit (PP2A(B)). The core enzyme consists of PP2A(C) and PP2A(A), and one of the many B regulatory subunits associates with this core enzyme (A/C) to form a holoenzyme with specific properties and substrates (27Kremmer E. Ohst K. Kiefer J. Brewis N. Walter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1692-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of the catalytic core of PP2A, i.e. PP2A(Cα) and PP2A(Cβ), which share 97% identity in their primary amino acid sequences (28Arino J. Woon C.W. Brautigan D.L. Miller Jr., T.B.

A. 1987; 84: 4880-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PP2A(Cα) is more abundant than PP2A(Cβ). PP2A(A) is also present in two isoforms in mammalian cells, α and β, which share 86% sequence identity (31Hemmings B.A. Adams-Pearson C. Maurer F. Muller P. Goris J. Merlevede W. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). PP2A(Aβ) is less abundant than PP2A(Aα), and it does not bind strongly to the catalytic C and regulatory B subunits (32Hendrix P. Turowski P. Mayer-Jaekel R.E. Goris J. Hofsteenge J. Merlevede W.

J. 2003; 369: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Much of the diversity of PP2A holoenzymes comes from the four major classes of PP2A(B) regulatory subunits, PR55/B, PR61/B′, PR72/B′′, and PR93/PR110/B′′′. Each exists in at least four isoforms leading to many different holoenzymes, which partially explains the multiple and diverse cellular functions of PP2A (23Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 34Mayer-Jaekel R.E. Hemmings B.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 287-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A role for PP2A in Vpr-induced G2 arrest was originally suggested by studies with the inhibitor okadaic acid in mammalian and yeast cells (12Re F. Braaten D. Franke E.K. Luban J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6859-6864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zhao Y. Cao J. O'Gorman M.R. Yu M. Yogev R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5821-5826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence came from fission yeast where deletion of the gene for a catalytic subunit (ppa2) or a regulatory subunit (pab1) of PP2A reduced Vpr-induced G2 arrest (14Elder R.T. Yu M. Chen M. Zhu X. Yanagida M. Zhao Y. Virology. 2001; 287: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 35Masuda M. Nagai Y. Oshima N. Tanaka K. Murakami H. Igarashi H. Okayama H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2636-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, specific involvement of PP2A in Vpr-induced G2 arrest in mammalian cells is controversial. A report showing Vpr induces G2 arrest in mammalian cells by interacting with the B55 regulatory subunit of PP2A (36Hrimech M. Yao X.J. Branton P.E. Cohen E.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3956-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was retracted (37Hrimech M. Yao X.J. Branton P.E. Cohen E.A. EMBO J. 2002; 213918Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the role of PP2A in the activation of ATR by Vpr during the induction of cell cycle G2 arrest. We measured the Vpr-induced phosphorylation of Chk1 and cell cycle G2 arrest when PP2A enzymatic activity was downregulated either by the potent PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) or by specific small interference RNA (siRNA) to PP2A. We show here that the Cβ and Aα subunits of PP2A, but not the Cα subunit, are required for the Vpr-induced and ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1. However, depletion of the Cβ and Aα subunits did not decrease the extent of nuclei with γH2AX foci or the amount of γH2AX formed even though these events are ATR-dependent. In contrast to the PP2A(Aα/Cβ) dependence of Chk1 phosphorylation when ATR is activated by Vpr, depletion of the Aα or Cβ subunit of PP2A has no effect on the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 when ATR is activated by HU or UV. Thus, PP2A has a positive role in the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 activated by Vpr but not when ATR is activated by HU or UV. Cell Culture—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The DL-3 cell line is a derivative of the HEK293VE-632 cell line stably transfected with an inducible vpr expression plasmid (pZH-vpr) (38Zhou Y. Ratner L. Virology. 2001; 287: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). DL-3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml zeocin, and 200 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). The expression of vpr is induced by 1 μm muristerone A (Invitrogen) as previously described (38Zhou Y. Ratner L. Virology. 2001; 287: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Drug Treatment—OA, a potent PP2A inhibitor, was purchased from Sigma. OA also inhibits other phosphatases (PPases) such as PP1, PP2B, and PP2C at high concentration (39Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). The range of OA concentrations (10–25 nm) used here should specifically inhibit PP2A (40Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To maintain proper final concentrations of OA during experiments, the same concentration of OA was added again 8 h after the first treatment. Cell treatment with HU or nocodazole (NOC) have been described previously (17Zimmerman E.S. Chen J. Andersen J.L. Ardon O. Dehart J.L. Blackett J. Choudhary S.K. Camerini D. Nghiem P. Planelles V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9286-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 10 mm HU for 2 h or 100 ng/ml NOC for 24 h before harvest. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Ckd1-Tyr15, rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-Chk1-Ser345 (133D3), and mouse monoclonal anti-PP2A(A) (4G7) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-Chk1 (G-4) and rabbit polyclonal anti-PP2A(C) (FL-309) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Mouse monoclonal anti-Cdk1 (Ab-2) and rabbit polyclonal anti-ATR (Ab-2) antibodies were from Calbiochem. Mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (AC-15) antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Claspin (BL73) antibodies were from Bethyl Laboratories Inc. (Montgomery, TX), and mouse monoclonal anti-phosphohistone γ-H2AX (Ser139) antibody was from Upstate, Inc. (Charlottesville, VA). Texas Red® goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) secondary antibody was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc (Eugene, OR). Goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) HRP conjugate secondary antibodies were from Bio-Rad. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Vpr serum was custom generated through the Proteintech Group Inc. (Chicago, IL). Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 35 min at 4 °C on Labtek II slides 48 h post-transfection. After washing 3 times for 5 min in PBS, cells were blocked and permeabilized for 20 min in blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.01% skim milk in PBS). Cells were then incubated with primary antibody with proper dilutions in the incubation buffer (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 45 min. After washing, cells were incubated with secondary antibody at the suggested dilutions in the incubation buffer for 35 min. After washing, cells were mounted with FluorSave reagent and visualized on a Leica DM4500B microscope (Leica Microsystems) with Openlab software (Improvision, Lexington, MA). Western Blotting—Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) on ice for 30 min, and the debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 min. The protein concentrations of supernatants were measured by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). After boiling, 50 μg of protein was loaded on Criterion Precast Gels (Bio-Rad) for electrophoretic separation. Proteins were transferred to the Trans-blot® nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were then applied overnight at 4 °C. After washing 3 times in TBST for 10 min each time, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed again, and proteins were detected with Supersignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). siRNA Transfection—SMARTpool™ combination of specific siRNAs, which were pre-designed commercially for PP2A(Aα) (PPP2R1A, #M-010259), Claspin (#M-005288), and ATR-2 pub. siRNA Duplex (#P-002090), were purchased from Dharmacon (Chicago, IL). Pre-designed PP2A(Cα) siRNA mix (PPP2CA, #16704) was purchased from Ambion (Lafayette, CO), PP2A(Cβ) (#RI-4682, RI-4683, and RI-4684) were purchased from Molecula (Columbia, MD), and the control nonsilencing siRNA (#1022083) was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA (10Roshal M.

The sequences of the three siRNAs against PP2A Cα were 5′-GGGATACCGTTTAATTTAA-3′,5′-GGCTAAAGAAATCCTGACA-3′, and 5′-GGTTCGATGTCCAGTTACT-3′. The sequences of the three siRNAs against Cβ were 5′-ATGTGCAAGAGGTTCGTTG-3′,5′-TGTCTGCGAAAGTATGGGA-3′, and 5′-TTGGTGTCATGATCGGAAT-3′. Each siRNA mixture was transfected at a concentration of 100 nm into ∼5 × 105 dividing HeLa cells by using 15 μl of Oligofectamine following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Measurement of transfection efficiency of siRNAs by using rhodamine-labeled siRNA indicated >90% transfection efficiency. A semiquantitative RT-PCR assay for Cα and Cβ mRNA used the primers 5′-ACCAAGGAGCTGGACCAGTG-3′ and 5′-CCATGCACATCTCCACAGAC-3′ with SuperScript™ one-step RT-PCR system (#10928-034, Invitrogen). These primers are perfect matches to both the Cα and Cβ sequences and give a 161-bp PCR product. When digested with the TaqI restriction enzyme, the Cα PCR product gives a 101-bp band, whereas Cβ gives a 136-bp band. Adenoviral Infection—Adenoviral vector (Adv) and Adenoviral vector inserted with vpr gene (Adv-Vpr) were kindly provided by Dr. L. J. Zhao (42Zhao L.J. Jian H. Zhu H. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 316: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The viral stocks were produced and titrated as described previously (43Zhang S. Feng Y. Narayan O. Zhao L.J. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 106 dividing HeLa cells pretreated with siRNA for 24 h were infected with Adv or Adv-Vpr viruses. Cells were harvested for cell cycle analysis or Western blot analysis 48 h post-infection (p.i.). Infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 with 10 μg/ml Polybrene. These conditions were shown to achieve more greater than 90% efficiency with these viral stocks. Cell Cycle Analysis—At 48 h post-transfection (p.t.), cells were collected by trypsinization. Cells were then washed twice with 2 ml of 5 mm EDTA/PBS and centrifuged at 1500 rpm. After resuspension in 1 ml of 5 mm EDTA/PBS, cells were fixed with 2.5 ml of 95–100% cold ethanol and kept at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation, fixed cells were washed twice with 2 ml of 5 mm EDTA/PBS and centrifuged again at 1500 rpm. After resuspension again in 0.5 ml of PBS, cells were incubated with RNase A (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min and then at 0 °C with the addition of propidium iodine (10 μg/ml) for 1 h. Cells were then filtered before analysis of DNA content by FACScan flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson). The cell cycle profiles were modeled by use of the ModFit software (Verity Software House, Inc.). Inhibition of PP2A Enzymatic Activity Reduces Vpr-induced G2 Arrest—OA, a specific and potent inhibitor of PP2A, was first used to determine whether PP2A is involved in Vpr-induced G2 arrest. A vpr-inducible system in the HEK293 cell line (38Zhou Y. Ratner L. Virology. 2001; 287: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was used to test the effect of Vpr in the presence or absence of PP2A. The expression of vpr was induced by 1 μm muristerone A, and increasing concentrations of OA in a range that specifically inhibits PP2A were added to the culture medium of vpr-expressing or vpr-repressing cells. Sixty-four hours after gene induction, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for DNA content. The cell cycle profiles are shown in Fig. 1A, and the percentage of cells in G2/M are shown in Fig. 1B. As expected, vpr-expressing HEK293 cells showed a significant accumulation (62.1%) of cells in G2/M phase, whereas without vpr expression only 12.5% of cells were in G2/M phase (Fig. 1A). No significant differences were seen in cells with or without vpr expression treated with 10 nm OA. However, Vpr-induced G2 accumulation was significantly reduced when the concentrations of OA reached 17.5 and 25 nm. Although treatment with these higher concentrations of OA on cells without vpr expression caused small increases of cells in G2 to 12.5–21.3%, the percentage of the G2 cells decreased from 62.1 to 37.1 and 37.3% in the vpr-expressing cells treated with these higher concentrations of OA (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the activity of PP2A is required for Vpr-induced G2 arrest. The Aα and Cβ Subunits of PP2A, but Not Cα, Are Required for the Vpr-induced Cell Cycle G2 Arrest—Even though OA has been shown to be a potent PP2A inhibitor at the concentrations used (40Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), we cannot rule out the possibility that other phosphatases might also be inhibited by OA. To further confirm the involvement of PP2A in Vpr-induced G2 arrest, we used specific siRNA to deplete PP2A. Because siRNA technology is highly specific, different subunits of PP2A can be knocked down to allow detailed dissection of the role of PP2A in Vpr-induced G2 arrest. Here we tested both isoforms of the catalytic subunits of PP2A(C), i.e. PP2A(Cα) and PP2A(Cβ), and the predominant regulatory PP2A(Aα) subunit. HeLa cells were transfected with specific siRNAs for PP2A(Cα), PP2A(Cβ), PP2A(Aα), and control siRNA. Twenty-four hours p.t., the cells were either mock-infected or infected with Adv or Adv-Vpr, and 48 h post-infection (p.i.), the cellular DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry. All of the mock or Adv infected cells displayed near normal cell cycle profiles regardless of the siRNA treatment, indicating those siRNAs had no significant effect on the cell cycle (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the idea that Vpr induces cell cycle G2 arrest, cells infected with Adv-Vpr and either untreated or pretreated with control siRNA had a marked accumulation of cells with G2/M DNA content. The percentage of G2/M cells increased from 8.0 to 8.4% without Vpr to 71.9–87.3% with Vpr. However, Vpr-induced accumulation of G2/M cells was markedly reduced when either PP2A(Cβ) or PP2A(Aα) was depleted by siRNA (Fig. 2A, bottom panels). Only 28.4% of the cells had G2/M DNA content after PP2A(Cβ) depletion and only 32.9% for PP2A(Aα) depletion. In contrast, no significant reduction of cells in G2/M was observed in Adv-Vpr-infected cells when PP2A(Cα) was depleted (Fig. 2A, middle panel). The extent of depletion by the siRNAs was examined by immunoblots and, for the catalytic subunit, by a semiq"
https://openalex.org/W2114740224,"Insulin secretion by the beta cell depends on anaplerosis in which insulin secretagogues are metabolized by mitochondria into molecules that are most likely exported to the extramitochondrial space where they have signaling roles. However, very little is known about the products of anaplerosis. We discovered an experimental paradigm that has begun to provide new information about these products. When various intracellular metabolites were applied in combination to overnight-cultured rat or human pancreatic islets or to INS-1 832/13 cells, they interacted synergistically to strongly stimulate insulin release. When these same metabolites were applied individually to these cells, insulin stimulation was poor. Discerning the contributions of the individual compounds to metabolism has begun to allow us to dissect some of the pathways involved in insulin secretion, which was not possible from studying individual secretagogues. Monomethyl succinate (MMS) combined with a barely stimulatory concentration of α-ketoisocaproate (KIC) (2 mm) stimulated insulin release in cultured rat islets 18-fold (<i>versus</i> 21-fold for 16.7 mm glucose). MMS plus low glucose (2 mm) or pyruvate (5 mm) gave 11- and 9-fold stimulations. These agents also potentiated MMS-induced insulin release in fresh islets, and KIC plus MMS gave synergistic insulin release in cultured human islets. In INS-1 cells, neither MMS nor KIC (10 mm) was an insulin secretagogue, but when added together KIC (2 mm) and MMS stimulated insulin release 7-fold (<i>versus</i> 12-fold for glucose). In islets and INS-1 cells, conditions that stimulated insulin release caused large relative increases in acetoacetate, which is a precursor of pathways to short chain acyl-CoAs. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry measurements of acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, and malonyl-CoA confirmed that they were increased by insulin secretagogues. The results suggest a new mechanism of insulin secretion in which anaplerosis increases short chain acyl-CoAs that have roles in insulin exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2036517395,"Defects in podocyte signaling are the basis of many inherited glomerular diseases leading to glomerulosclerosis. CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) is highly expressed in podocytes and is considered to play an important role in the maintenance of the glomerular slit diaphragm. Mice deficient for CD2AP (CD2AP-/-) appear normal at birth but develop a rapid onset nephrotic syndrome at 3 weeks of age. We demonstrate that impaired intracellular signaling with subsequent podocyte damage is the reason for this delayed podocyte injury in CD2AP-/- mice. We document that CD2AP deficiency in podocytes leads to diminished signal initiation and termination of signaling pathways mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). In addition, we demonstrate that CIN85, a paralog of CD2AP, is involved in termination of RTK signaling in podocytes. CIN85 protein expression is increased in CD2AP-/- podocytes in vitro. Stimulation of CD2AP-/- podocytes with various growth factors, including insulin-like growth factor 1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor, resulted in a significantly decreased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and ERK signaling response. Moreover, increased CIN85 protein is detectable in podocytes in diseased CD2AP-/- mice, leading to decreased base-line activation of ERK and decreased phosphorylation after growth factor stimulation in vivo. Because repression of CIN85 protein leads to a restored RTK signaling response, our results support an important role of CD2AP/CIN85 protein balance in the normal signaling response of podocytes.

We and others have previously demonstrated that the PI3K/AKT signaling response plays an important role for podocyte survival in particular in the presence of active transforming growth factor β (3Schiffer M.

We recently demonstrated that the PI3K/AKT response is directly targeted by cytokine cross-talk and subsequently influences the cellular outcome (5Peters I. Tossidou I. Achenbach J. Woroniecki R.

The adaptor molecules CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) and CIN85 belong to a family of adaptor molecules that selectively control the spatial and temporal assembly of multiprotein complexes that transmit intracellular signals. For both molecules various interaction partners have been described placing them at the center of regulatory pathways involving signaling (6Huber T.B. Hartleben B. Kim J. Schmidts M. Schermer B.

Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that CD2AP and CIN85 contribute to the balance of RTK signaling in podocytes. The anatomical localization of the podocyte exposes this highly specialized cell type to a variety of cellular stressors like stretch force, reactive oxygen species, osmotic milieu changes, cytokines and chemokines, filtrated toxins, and waste products. Therefore, this location requires the cells to have a highly effective cellular response system to counteract proapoptotic cell programs induced by these factors. Deficiency in CD2AP leads to a differentiation-dependent increase in expression of its paralog CIN85 in vitro and in vivo. This leads subsequently to a severe signaling defect in podocytes. Our results could explain the sudden and uniform disease onset and the rapid progression of the disease in this mouse model. We hypothesize that any inherited or acquired change in the CD2AP/CIN85 protein balance may lead to a debilitation in podocyte survival signaling with subsequent podocyte loss and the development of glomerulosclerosis. Antibodies and Reagents—Primary antibodies used for co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunocytochemical studies were rabbit anti-phosphoS473AKT, mouse anti-phosphoY204ERK, mouse anti-AKT1, rabbit anti-ERK, rabbit anti-FLAG, rabbit anti-Myc (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), rabbit anti-CD2AP, rabbit anti-Grb2, rabbit anti-β-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-SOS1 (Transduction Laboratories), rabbit anti-Cin85 (CT) (gift from Ivan Dikic), mouse anti-Synaptopodin (Progen, Heidelberg, Germany). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse as secondary antibodies for Western blotting were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cytokines and inhibitors were purchased from the following vendors: rhIGF-1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), rhFGF4, rhVEGF1 (Cell Sciences, Canton, MA), LY294002, PD98059 (Calbiochem), farnesylthiosalicylic acid (Sigma). Podocyte Culture, Cytokine Stimulation, and Inhibition of MEKK, PI3K, and Ras—Cultivation of conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes was performed as described by Mundel et al. (13Mundel P. Reiser J. Zuniga Mejia B.A. Pavenstadt H. Davidson G.R. Kriz W. Zeller R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). To propagate podocytes, cells were cultivated on type I collagen (BD Biosciences) at 33 °C in the presence of 10 units/ml mouse recombinant γ-interferon (Cell Sciences) (permissive conditions) to enhance expression of a thermo-sensitive T antigen. To induce differentiation, podocytes were maintained at 37 °C for 14 days without γ-interferon, resulting in absence of thermo-sensitive T antigen (non-permissive conditions). Differentiated podocytes were stimulated with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (20 ng/ml) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (20 ng/ml). To inhibit AKT and ERK activation, cells were pretreated with 20 μm LY294002, PD98059, or farnesylthiosalicylic acid for 20 min prior to cytokine stimulation. Western Blot Analysis—To analyze whole cell protein lysates from cultivated podocytes, either untreated or treated cells were lysed on ice in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitor (complete mini; Roche Applied Sciences), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, and 200 μg/liter okadaic acid. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm, and aliquots of the supernatants were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA). After probing with primary antibodies, antigen-antibody complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies, respectively, and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. GST Pulldown Assays—For pulldown assay 500 μg of total cell lysate was incubated with 1 μg of GST Grb2 full-length (gift from S. M. Feller, Oxford, UK) and glutathione-Sepharose beads in pulldown buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) overnight at 4 °C. The pellets were washed in pulldown buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blot was performed using the methods mentioned above. Animals—Target disruption and generation of CD2AP-deficient homozygous mice on a 129/J background is described elsewhere (14Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 286: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Kidney tissue was prepared from 2- and 3-week-old mice. Immunohistochemistry—After dissection, kidneys were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and immediately frozen in tissue molds containing optimal cutting temperature compound. Sections were collected onto slides, blocked with 10% donkey serum, stained with the appropriate primary antibody followed by Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch). For light microscopy slides and electron microscopy the tissue was perfusion-fixed and processed following a standard protocol. Isolation and Processing of Glomeruli—Glomeruli were isolated from kidneys of 3-week-old CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- mice using a sequential sieving technique with mesh sizes of 180, 100, and 71 μm. The fraction collected from the 71-μm sieve was maintained in tissue culture dishes at 37 °C for 24 h before stimulation. After stimulation glomeruli were resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer and disrupted with a dounce homogenizer by hand with 50 up-and-down strokes. For immunohistochemistry, glomeruli were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and the pellets were immediately frozen in optimal cutting temperature. 2-μm cryosections were cut and fluorescence staining was performed using the methods mentioned above. Design and Cloning of Lentiviral siRNA Vectors—The pLVTHM-deltaH-2K lentivirus transfer vector used in this study was generated by replacing enhanced green fluorescent protein sequences in the pLVTHM vector (kindly provided by Dr. Didier Trono, Department of Genetics and Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Switzerland) on delta H-2K from pMACS Kk.II vector encoding the truncated H-2Kk surface marker (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The pLVTHM-deltaH-2K lentivirus transfer vector was used as a first step to ligate the Cin85 siRNA oligonucleotides (Cin85si): sense, 5′-CGCGTCCCCgaggcacaga atgatgatgaattTTCAAGAGAaattcatcatcattctgtgcctcTTTTTGGAAAT; antisense, 5′-CGATTTCCAAAAAGaggcacagaatgatgatgaattTCTC TTGAAaattcatcatcattctgtgcctcGGGGA. The hybridized oligonucleotides were ligated into the lentivirus transfer vector between MluI and ClaI restriction sites. Lentiviral Vector Production and Cell Infection—Lentiviral vectors were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells according to standard protocols. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and, when subconfluent, transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) using ratio of pCMV-dR8.74: pMD2G:pLVTHM-deltaH-2K-Cin85si or pLVTHM-deltaH-2K as a control = 3:2:1. After 48 h post-transfection cell supernatants, containing viral particles, were filtered using 0.4 μm Steriflip vacuum filtration system (Millipore) and concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 50,000 × g for 1.5 h at 4 °C. For lentiviral infection, differentiated CD2AP-/- podocytes were grown until 70–80% confluence and infected in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene with viruses and used for experiments 3 days after infection. Transfection—The day before transfection the podocytes were seeded on 60-mm dishes. On the day of transfection cells were transfected using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol using FLAG-mCIN85, Myc-mCD2AP (gift from T. Huber), and pcDNA3.1 as a control. Cells were cultured in normal growth medium for 72 h after transfection, serum-starved overnight, and stimulated with FGF. Podocyte Damage in 3-Week-old CD2AP-/- Mice Occurs Simultaneously in All Glomeruli—Previously we described that podocyte apoptosis is an early lesion during the development of the disease in CD2AP-/- mice and that apoptotic cell death is detectable in the endocapillary/mesangial compartments only at later time points (3Schiffer M. Mundel P. Shaw A.S. Bottinger E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37004-37012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It still remains unclear why CD2AP-/- mice are born normal, develop a regular glomerular filtration barrier, and then within a time frame of 1–2 days become severely nephrotic. With detailed morphological analysis of diseased kidneys, we revealed global podocyte damage in a uniform temporal fashion. Glomerular damage was evaluated by periodic acid-Schiff staining at 2 and 3 weeks of age in CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- mice (n = 5 in each group). We found in CD2AP-/- mice at 2 weeks of age no mesangial matrix accumulation or damage in 221 examined glomerular profiles. However, at 3 weeks of age we found glomerular profiles with mesangial expansion and damage in 288 of 302 (95.4%) examined, compared with 378 normal-appearing glomerular profiles in CD2AP+/+ mice. When we examined glomerular profiles of CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- mice (n = 2 in each group) using 1-μm sections (Fig. 1a) we found that in 192 examined glomerular profiles all of them (100%) showed mesangial proliferation in at least one lobule. Next, foot process effacement was evaluated in 10 complete glomerular profiles by transmission electron microscopy. In all of them the majority of loops exhibited complete foot process effacement (Fig. 1b), whereas controls were negative. Thus, there is a 100% penetrance of the damage in the CD2AP-/- mice. Within the cytoplasm sheets of podocytes that adhere broadly to the GBM we detected a prominent basal cytoskeletal layer consisting of a dense network of actin filaments (Fig. 1c, insert). The parietal epithelial cells (PECs) were affected and also developed lesions (i.e. vacuolization of the cytoplasm) (Fig. 1b). However, the parietal cell damage was not as uniform as in the podocytes. Because epithelial cells, the podocytes, and the PECs were all affected, the tuft adhesions were of an advanced type for the GBM directly attached to the parietal basement membrane over large distances without any interposed cells. Concurrently, we detected mesangial expansion with close meshed mesangiolysis followed by mesangial cell proliferation and matrix deposition in every lobule prominently including the vascular pole, resulting in a conspicuous broadening of the glomerular entrance and stalk. In 171 examined CD2AP-/- profiles and 61 examined CD2AP+/+ profiles (n = 2 in each group) with a visible stalk broadening, we detected mesangial thickening in the afferent vessel portion in 100% of the CD2AP-/- glomeruli and 0% of the CD2AP+/+ glomeruli. Taken together, these results indicate that the disease in CD2AP-/- mice is neither focal nor segmental. The uniformity of the lesions seems highly suggestive for the dysregulation of a physiological process necessary for the maintenance of normal glomerular tuft architecture. CD2AP-/- Podocytes Show Dysregulated Activation Profiles for PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 after Growth Factor Stimulation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs)—When we tested the PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 signaling response after stimulation of RTKs with different growth factors, we detected diminished activation profiles in various CD2AP-/- podocytes clones (see “Podocyte Culture” under “Materials and Methods”). Depending on the growth factors tested we detected a more pronounced effect on signal initiation or on signal termination in the activation profiles of PI3K/AKT or ERK1/2. After stimulation with insulin-like growth factor 1 (100 ng/ml) we could not detect a significant difference in phosphorylation of AKT in CD2AP-/- podocytes compared with CD2AP+/+ podocytes. However, in CD2AP-/- podocytes phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was terminated already at 4 h after stimulation, whereas strong phosphorylation was still visible 24 h after stimulation in CD2AP+/+ podocytes (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, treatment of the cells with FGF (20 ng/ml) or VEGF (20 ng/ml) resulted in weak AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 2A) or ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B) in CD2AP-/- podocytes compared with CD2AP+/+ cells. Treatment of the cells with platelet-derived growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, or epidermal growth factor revealed activation defects similar to the treatment with insulin-like growth factor 1 with comparable phosphorylation levels for AKT and ERK1/2 but earlier signal termination in CD2AP-/- podocytes (data not shown). It has been demonstrated that direct interaction of CD2AP with the p85 subunit of PI3K resulted in AKT phosphorylation (6Huber T.B. Hartleben B. Kim J. Schmidts M. Schermer B. Keil A. Egger L. Lecha R.L. Borner C. Pavenstadt H. Shaw A.S. Walz G. Benzing T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4917-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). However, so far only little is known about potential interaction partners of CD2AP resulting in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (15Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To dissect the possible pathway defects we first investigated whether phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 are dependent on each other. In some cell types PI3Ks have been identified as effectors of Ras proteins (16Pacold M.E. Suire S. Perisic O. Lara-Gonzalez S. Davis C.T. Walker E.H. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Eccleston J.F. Williams R.L. Cell. 2000; 103: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we used chemical inhibitors of PI3K, Ras, and MEK activation to selectively mimic the situation found in CD2AP-/- cells. Using the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 we detected specific inhibition of PI3K/AKT phosphorylation but no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Preincubation of the cells with farnesylthiosalicylic acid or PD98059 for specific inhibition of Ras and MEK activation resulted in complete abrogation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation but no effect was detectable on PI3K/AKT signaling. To elucidate whether the signaling defect in CD2AP-/- podocytes is localized upstream of Ras-GTP we examined phospho-Raf in CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- cells. In CD2AP-/- podocytes we did not detect phospho-Raf, indicating that the CD2AP-dependent effect is localized upstream of Ras-Raf activation (data not shown). Taken together these results indicate that CD2AP is essential for the normal course of both signaling cascades. Furthermore, in podocytes the activation of both pathways is not dependent on each other, suggesting an autonomous role for CD2AP in the regulation of these two pathways. CD2AP-/- Podocytes Show an Inducible Disruption of Grb2-SOS Binding Profile and an Inducible Binding of Grb2-CIN85 after Stimulation of RTK with FGF or VEGF—Because Ras activation is directly influenced by Grb2-SOS (son of sevenless) binding, we wanted to examine whether CD2AP deficiency has an influence on Grb2-SOS binding activity in podocytes. Therefore, we performed GST-Grb2 pulldown experiments with cell lysates of CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- podocytes. On stimulation of CD2AP-/- podocytes with FGF (20 ng/ml) we detected significant reduction of Grb2-SOS binding after 30 min. Interestingly, we also detected binding of CIN85 to Grb2 after stimulation of CD2AP-/- podocytes with FGF for 30 min (Fig. 3A). Investigating a time course in CD2AP+/+ cells, we detected a reduction of Grb2-SOS binding 4 h after stimulation with FGF accompanied by binding of CIN85 to Grb2. Stimulation of podocytes with VEGF also resulted in inducible binding of CIN85 and reduced binding of SOS to Grb2. Again reduction of Grb2-SOS binding was detectable at later time points in CD2AP+/+ podocytes as well (Fig. 3B). To further evaluate our Grb2 pulldown experiments, we examined the base-line expression levels of involved proteins in unstimulated CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- podocyte clones. We found no difference in the basic expression levels of SOS or Grb2; however, in lysates of CD2AP-/- clones we detected a marked increase in basic expression of two isoforms of CIN85, a paralog of CD2AP (Fig. 3C). In summary, these results demonstrate that CD2AP deficiency leads to a dysregulation of Grb2-SOS binding in podocytes. Moreover, loss of CD2AP results in up-regulation of CIN85, a binding partner of Grb2, competing with SOS for Grb2 binding. The inducible binding of CIN85 to Grb2 in CD2AP+/+ podocytes at later time points may indicate that this interaction is part of the physiological ERK1/2 signal termination in podocytes. Dysregulated Expression of CIN85 and Subsequent Signaling Defects Are Dependent on the Differentiation State of Podocytes—Interestingly, examination of the signaling response in undifferentiated, proliferating CD2AP-/- podocytes showed that these cells were not affected in activation of ERK1/2 after stimulation with FGF. In contrast to differentiated cells in undifferentiated, proliferating CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- podocytes the signal initiation and termination profiles of ERK1/2 were identical (Fig. 4A). When we examined CIN85 protein expression levels, we detected low expression of CIN85 that was identical to undifferentiated wild-type cells. When we harvested the cells after 2, 6, 8, and 12 days of differentiation, we found in CD2AP-/- podocytes an accumulation of CIN85 protein. In contrast, in CD2AP+/+ podocytes the expression level of CIN85 was unchanged (Fig. 4B). The degree of differentiation was not different between CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- podocytes as indicated by comparable levels of the differentiation marker synaptopodin. However, when we examined the expression of CIN85 mRNA in differentiating cells we did not detect a difference in CIN85 mRNA levels between CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- cells over time (data not shown). Next we examined the phosphorylation response of ERK1/2 after stimulation with FGF at different points of differentiation and found that in CD2AP-/- cells ERK1/2 activation decreased with ongoing differentiation in CIN85-expressing cells (Fig. 4C). To confirm that the effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation had been modulated by CIN85 in differentiated CD2AP-/- cells, we selectively down-regulated CIN85 expression using a lentivirus-based CIN85 siRNA expression vector. As expected, ERK1/2 phosphorylation had been restored in differentiated podocytes by suppression of CIN85 expression (Fig. 4D). Introduction of the siRNA expression vector in CD2AP+/+ cells did not result in a changed signaling response after growth factor stimulation. In contrast, transient overexpression of CIN85 in CD2AP+/+ cells resulted in a significant decrease of ERK phosphorylation whereas the transient expression of CD2AP in CD2AP-/- cells could partially rescue the activation response (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these data indicate that a changed CD2AP/CIN85 balance leads to a severe dysregulation of RTK-mediated signaling in podocytes in vitro. CIN85 Is Up-regulated in Podocytes in Diseased CD2AP-/- Mice and Leads to a Reduced ERK Signaling Response— CD2AP-/- mice are born normal and develop a nephrotic syndrome only 3 weeks after birth. Before the onset of proteinuria there is complete integrity of podocytes and the slit diaphragm proteins nephrin and podocin, the two well described interaction partners of CD2AP at the glomerular filtration slit, are completely unaffected (14Shih N.Y.

Mundel P. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1621-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). We examined expression of CIN85 in CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- mice and found that CIN85 is up-regulated in glomeruli and tubuli in diseased 3-week-old CD2AP-/- mice. In the glomerulus we observed strong expression of CIN85 in the majority of podocytes throughout the whole kidney in diseased 3-week-old CD2AP-/- mice (Fig. 5A, panels c, f, i). In contrast, in 2-week-old non-proteinuric CD2AP-/- mice no CIN85 expression was detected (Fig. 5A, a, d, g), similar to CD2AP+/+ control animals (Fig. 5A, panels b, e, h). Interestingly, this corresponds to a lower base-line expression level of pERK in podocytes in vivo (Fig. 5B, left panel). To link increased CIN85 expression with impaired ERK signaling response in vivo we isolated glomeruli of CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- mice, treated them in a culture dish with FGF, and examined pERK levels in cryosections and by Western blot analysis. As expected, we detected a reduced ERK signaling response in podocytes in CD2AP-/- glomeruli after FGF stimulation (Fig. 5B, right panel). These data are supported by a reduced pERK response detected in protein lysates of CD2AP-/- glomeruli (Fig. 5C). Consistently, we detected a high level of CIN85 protein in the examined glomerular extracts. Taken together, these data indicate that CD2AP deficiency leads to a dysregulated expression of CIN85 in podocytes in vivo resulting in a changed signaling response. PI3K and Ras/ERK MAPK are two of the most important signaling pathways in eukaryotic cells. Recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane requires the regulatory subunit p85. The SH2 domain of p85 binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in specific docking sites of the intracellular domain of RTKs or adaptor proteins (1Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). MAPK pathways convey signals via phosphorylation events and form a complex with their cognate MAPKKs utilizing their common docking domain, and a variety of scaffolding proteins interact with several components of the MAPK cascades to tether both enzymes and substrates specifically to achieve accurate signal transduction (19Gaestel M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). CD2AP and CIN85 are ubiquitously expressed adaptor molecules containing three SH3 domains, a proline-rich region, and a coiledcoil domain (20Dikic I. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this study we report the regulatory involvement of the CD2AP/CIN85 balance in the orchestrated signal transduction response induced by RTKs in podocytes. We hypothesize that in podocytes CD2AP and CIN85 are the key components influencing initiation, maintenance, and termination of RTK-transduced signals. Further on, dysregulation in this balance, as induced by the CD2AP knock out, affects all signaling networks influenced by RTKs. As a consequence, important differentiation and survival signaling cascades necessary for the maintenance of a normal glomerular tuft are disturbed. To support our hypothesis we provide the following lines of evidence: First, we showed that CD2AP deficiency in mice results in a synchronized podocyte damage with global foot process effacement simultaneously in all glomeruli. Moreover, our results from CD2AP-deficient podocytes indicate a profound defect in AKT and ERK1/2 signaling response after stimulation of RTKs with various growth factors. Therefore, we presume that CD2AP acts in podocytes as a necessary cofactor for early and continuous activation of PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 signaling response after stimulation of RTKs. Particularly in the case of VEGF this is of great interest because this would directly affect paracrine signaling activity via VEGF in podocytes. Depending on recent data, this mechanism is discussed as important for podocyte survival in vitro (21Guan F. Villegas G. Teichman J. Mundel P. Tufro A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F422-F428Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Foster R.R. Satchell S.C. Seckley J. Emmett M.S. Joory K. Xing C.Y. Saleem M.A. Mathieson P.W. Bates D.O. Harper S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: F196-F207Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because these signaling effects were demonstrated for the activation of the PI3K/AKT and the Ras-ERK-MAPK pathway, we confirmed that these two pathways are not dependent on each other. We demonstrated that selective inhibition of MEK or Ras in wild-type podocytes did not affect PI3K/AKT activation and, in turn, inhibition of PI3K/AKT did not affect ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Depending on these data, we suggest that in podocytes the activation of these two distinct pathways is clearly not dependent on each other. Second, when we examined Grb2-SOS binding we detected a dynamic binding using GST-Grb2 pulldown experiments. Grb2-SOS binding is reduced in CD2AP-/- cells after growth factor stimulation, and there is inducible binding of CIN85 to Grb2 already 30 min after growth factor stimulation. When we performed extended time course experiments growth factor-inducible reduction of Grb2-SOS and inducible Grb2-CIN85 binding was also detectable in wild-type cells, but at later time points. Interestingly, Grb2 was identified earlier in association with CIN85 complexes in other cells; however, a time-dependent dynamic of this interaction was not previously described (23Watanabe S.

In other epithelial cells, CIN85 is a well known mediator of ligand-dependent ubiquitination and down-regulation of RTKs (12Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 808-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore we assume that the dysregulated expression of CIN85 in podocytes accounts for the detected signaling effects on different levels. To further confirm our results we also examined the potential role of disabled-2 (Dab-2) in our system. Dab-2 is a tumor suppressor gene with a C-terminal proline-rich SH3-binding domain. Binding of Dab-2 to Grb2 is described as disrupting SOS binding and suppressing down-stream ERK phosphorylation in other cells (27Zhou J. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27793-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When we examined Grb2-Dab-2 interaction in CD2AP+/+ and CD2AP-/- podocytes, we did not detect a difference in binding of Grb2-Dab-2 in the presence or absence of growth factors (data not shown). Third, our in vitro data confirm that the expression of CIN85 and the associated signaling effects are dependent on the differentiation state of the podocytes. We demonstrated in CD2AP-/- podocytes that with ongoing degree of differentiation the expression of CIN85 protein increased. Depending on the differentiation a diminished ERK1/2 phosphorylation coincided with up-regulated CIN85 expression in the CD2AP-/- podocytes. Silencing of CIN85 can restore the signaling answer in fully differentiated CD2AP-/- podocytes. Transient overexpression of CIN85 in CD2AP+/+ cells leads to a similar disruption of ERK signaling, whereas transient expression of CD2AP in CD2AP-/- cells can partially restore the signaling response. Fourth, we detected in podocytes of 3-week-old CD2AP-/- mice a dramatic increase of CIN85 protein expression. In the diseased mice expression of CIN85 protein is detectable in the majority of podocytes. In contrast, in 2-week-old CD2AP-/- mice and CD2AP+/+ mice we did not detect CIN85 expression in podocytes. We detected decreased base-line ERK activity in podocytes of 3-week-old CD2AP-/- mice and demonstrated a diminished response to growth factor stimulation on isolated glomeruli. Finally, we take our findings of synchronized podocyte damage and the uniformity of the lesions as additional evidence that we elucidated a dysregulated physiological mechanism in podocytes. We conclude from our results that CD2AP and CIN85 are responsible for a very delicate physiological balance that is important for RTK response in podocytes. The up-regulation of CIN85 in vivo in podocytes might have devastating effects on the normal physiological paracrine and exocrine signals that are necessary to maintain functional podocytes. Secondary to that, the regulatory axis involving a cross-talk of podocytes to endothelial cells and/or mesangial cells is severely deteriorated, leading to the observed phenotype in CD2AP-/- mice. Because the podocyte-specific rescue of CD2AP in the mouse model system leads to a normal phenotype with no other abnormality detected (28Grunkemeyer J.A. Kwoh C. Huber T.B. Shaw A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29677-29681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we presume that this mechanism is specific for podocytes. In other cell types CIN85 function might compensate for CD2AP deficiency. The podocyte-specific rescue model also demonstrates that the concomitant and prominent mesangiolysis and mesangial proliferation, as well as the parietal cell damage, are secondary to the podocyte damage. So far, work from various groups has demonstrated similar functions for CD2AP and CIN85 in receptor down-regulation (12Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I.

https://openalex.org/W1975482732,"Treatment with retinoic acid (RA) is effective to restore radioactive iodine uptake in metastases of a small fraction of thyroid cancer patients. In order to find predictive markers of response, we took advantage of two thyroid cancer cell lines, FTC133 and FTC238, with low RA-receptor (RAR)β expression but differing in their response to RA. We report that in both cell lines, RA signalling pathways are functional, as transactivation of an exogenous RARβ2 promoter is effective in the presence of pharmacological concentrations of all-trans RA, and enhanced in RA-resistant FTC238 cells after ectopical expression of RARβ, suggesting a defective endogenous RARβ2 promoter in these cells. Further analyses show that whereas the RARβ2 promoter is in an unmethylated permissive status in both FTC133 and FTC238 cells, it failed to be associated with acetylated forms of histones H3 or H4 in FTC238 cells upon RA treatment. Incubation with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, alone or in combination with RA, restored histone acetylation levels and reactivated RARβ and differentiation marker Na+/I− symporter gene expression. Thus, histone modification patterns may explain RA-refractoriness in differentiated thyroid cancer patients and suggest a potential benefit of combined transcriptional and differentiation therapies."

Hypusine synthesis is unique in that it occurs in only one protein, denoting the strict specificity of the modification enzymes toward the substrate protein. The specificity of the interaction between eIF5A and DOHH was investigated using human eIF5A (eIF5A-1 isoform) and human recombinant DOHH. DOHH displayed a strong preference for binding the deoxyhypusine-containing form of eIF5A, over the eIF5A precursor or the hypusine-containing eIF5A, indicating a role for the deoxyhypusine residue in binding. In addition to the deoxyhypusine residue, a large portion of the eIF5A polypeptide (>20-90 amino acids) is required for effective modification by DOHH. We have identified the amino acid residues of DOHH that are critical for substrate binding by alanine substitution of 36 conserved amino acid residues. Of these, alanine substitution at Glu57, Glu90, Glu208, Glu241, Gly63, or Gly214 caused a severe impairment in eIF5A(Dhp) binding, with a complete loss of binding and activity in the E57A and E208A mutant enzymes. Only aspartate substitution mutants, E57D or E208D, retained partial activity and substrate binding, whereas alanine, glutamine, or asparagine mutants did not. These findings support a proposed model of DOHH-eIF5A binding in which the amino group(s) of the deoxyhypusine side chain of the substrate is primarily anchored by γ-carboxyl groups of Glu57 and Glu208 at the DOHH active site.

The first enzyme, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS), catalyzes the NAD-dependent cleavage of spermidine and transfer of its 4-aminobutyl moiety to the ɛ-amino group of a specific lysine residue to form the deoxyhypusine (Nɛ-(4-aminobutyl)lysine) residue (2Wolff E.C.

Various metal chelating inhibitors of DOHH, including mimosine and ciclopirox olamine, inhibit cell proliferation by causing cell cycle arrest at the G1/S boundary (12Hanauske-Abel H.M. Park M.H.

Ciclolopirox olamine, in particular, exerted strong inhibition of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and angiogenesis in model assays, suggesting the potential utility of DOHH inhibitors as antitumor agents (13Clement P.M. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Wolff E.C. Kleinman H.K. Park M.H. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 100: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although DOHH has been proposed as a potential target of antitumor therapy (13Clement P.M. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Wolff E.C. Kleinman H.K. Park M.H. Int. J.

Zagulska S. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1807-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), no specific inhibitors of DOHH are currently available. The unique feature of hypusine formation is the strict substrate specificity of this protein modification. Hypusine synthesis occurs exclusively in one cellular protein, eIF5A precursor, at one specific lysine residue (Lys50 for the human protein) and thereby represents one of the most specific protein modifications known to date. eIF5A and its modifying enzymes, DHS and DOHH, are highly conserved in all eukaryotes (1Park M.H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 8Chen K.Y. Liu A.Y. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence conservation surrounding the hypusine site of eIF5A is especially high in eukaryotes, suggesting that the hypusine residue has an important basic function that has been preserved through evolution. Furthermore, the sequence conservation of eIF5A and its modifying enzymes reflects an important aspect of the substrate specificity of hypusine synthesis. The basis of the specificity of the hypusine modification must reside in the selective interactions between the eIF5A substrate protein and its modification enzymes. For example, DHS and Lia1 (Lia, ligand of eIF5A, later identified as DOHH (5Park J.H. Aravind L. Wolff E.C. Kaevel J. Kim Y.S. Park M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Park, unpublished results. upon affinity purification using epitope-tagged eIF5A bait protein. Furthermore, stable complexes of eIF5A(Lys)/DHS and eIF5A(Dhp)/DHS are detectable by native gel electrophoresis (17Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Wolff E.C. Dimitriadis E.K. Park M.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). No other cellular proteins undergo deoxyhypusine modification in intact cells (18Park M.H. Cooper H.L. Folk J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) or in vitro (19Park M.H. Wolff E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15264-15269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supporting the notion that the first step (deoxyhypusine synthesis) is a key element defining the specificity of the hypusine modification. The substrate specificity of DHS has been extensively studied, both for spermidine (20Jakus J. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13151-13159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the eIF5A precursor (21Joe Y.A. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25916-25921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither free lysine, nor a short peptide containing the highly conserved region around the lysine to be modified, acts as a substrate of DHS. A long polypeptide of eIF5A(Lys) (larger than aa 30-80) is required for effective modification by DHS (21Joe Y.A. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25916-25921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Little was known about the structure or specificity of deoxyhypusine hydroxylase until our recent cloning of yeast and human DOHH (5Park J.H. Aravind L. Wolff E.C. Kaevel J. Kim Y.S. Park M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It had been presumed to be a non-heme iron enzyme belonging to the family of 2-oxoacid- and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases, in part because deoxyhypusine hydroxylase activity in mammalian cells and tissues is inhibited by iron chelators (4Abbruzzese A.

Chem. 2003; 10: 1005-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), such as prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases or vice versa. In fact, the DOHH structure predicted from sequence analysis and computer modeling (5Park J.H. Aravind L. Wolff E.C. Kaevel J. Kim Y.S. Park M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) is entirely unrelated to the β jelly roll structure (termed double-stranded β helix) of Fe(II)- and 2-oxoacid-dependent dioxygenases. DOHH consists of eight HEAT repeats, in a symmetrical dyad of four HEAT motifs connected by a variable region. The predicted α-helical structure of DOHH was validated experimentally by determination of the α-helical content of purified human recombinant DOHH by CD analysis (77 versus 76-78%, calculated from the HEAT repeat model) (24Kim Y.S.

The iron-binding active site of DOHH and mode of iron binding also differ from those of 2-oxoacid and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases, suggesting a distinct reaction mechanism (24Kim Y.S. Kang K.R.

In many of the double-stranded β helix enzymes, iron is coordinated by His-X-Asp/Glu-Xn-His at three coordination sites, and by a 2-oxoacid and oxygen (22Hausinger R.P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 21-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Judging from the stoichiometry of 2 mol of iron per mol of DOHH holoenzyme, DOHH probably contains one binuclear (diiron) active center (24Kim Y.S. Kang K.R. Wolff E.C. Bell J.K. McPhie P. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13217-13225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In DOHH there are four strictly conserved His-Glu motifs (His56-Glu57, His89-Glu90, His207-Glu208, and His240-Glu241) predicted to be involved in the iron binding (5Park J.H. Aravind L. Wolff E.C. Kaevel J. Kim Y.S. Park M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Replacement of any one of these amino acids with alanine abolished DOHH activity (24Kim Y.S. Kang K.R. Wolff E.C. Bell J.K. McPhie P. Park M.H. J. Biol.

Of the eight alanine substitution mutant enzymes, six (H56A, H89A, E90A, H207A, H240A, and E241A) were deficient in iron binding, suggesting that His56, His89, Glu90, His207, His240, and Glu241 are involved in the coordination of iron (24Kim Y.S.

As for the two mutant enzymes E57A and E208A, which were totally inactive despite their normal iron content, the reason for their lack of activity was unknown. In this study we have investigated the structural basis of the specificity of deoxyhypusine hydroxylation. Our results demonstrate that deoxyhypusine hydroxylase specifically recognizes the deoxyhypusine form, eIF5A(Dhp), but not the lysine form, eIF5A(Lys), and that a large portion (aa 20-90) of this 154-aa protein is required for effective hydroxylation by DOHH. Analysis of DOHH mutant enzymes provides evidence that Glu57 and Glu208 of the conserved His-Glu motifs of DOHH, although not involved in iron coordination, are required for the association with the substrate protein. Based on the current findings, we propose a model of eIF5A(Dhp)/DOHH binding in which the side chain carboxyl groups of Glu57 and Glu208 of DOHH form ionic bridges with the amino group(s) of the deoxyhypusine side chain of the substrate protein. l-Glutathione was purchased from Sigma, glutathione-Sepharose 4B from Amersham Biosciences, Thrombin Cleavage Capture Kit from Novagen, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixtures from Sigma.

A. 2006; 103: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), was used as a template for PCR and the primer sets were designed for substitution of an individual amino acid with alanine, aspartic acid, asparagine, or glutamine. Human DOHH fragments, N-terminal half (aa 1-151) and C-terminal half (aa 152-302), were generated as GST fusion proteins using the pGEX-4T-3 vector by PCR amplification of the N- or C-terminal halves and subcloning into BamHI/SalI sites of pGEX-4T-3 vector. The entire open reading frame of the mutated or truncated DOHH was sequenced for confirmation of the intended mutation or truncation. The recombinant plasmids were introduced into BL21(DE3) competent cells for overexpression of the mutant enzymes. Purification of Wild Type and Mutant DOHH Enzymes—The wild type and mutant DOHH enzymes were purified as described previously (5Park J.H. Aravind L. Wolff E.C. Kaevel J. Kim Y.S. Park M.H. Proc.

The selected clones of BL21(DE3) cells were grown in 120 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin. Protein expression was induced at a density of 0.6 (OD600 nm) by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 3 h. Cell pellets were resuspended in 2.4 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA free) and lysed by sonication using an Ultrasonic Processor. After centrifugation of the lysate at 15,000 × g for 30 min, the clarified supernatant was rotated with 0.6 ml of GSH-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C. The resins were washed with buffer B (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 m NaCl) three times using spin modules (Q-Biogene) and divided into two tubes. One-half was used for preparation of GST fusion enzymes by elution with buffer C (50 mm Tris·HCl, 1mm DTT, 30 mm GSH, final pH 8.0). The other half of the resin was treated with thrombin using the Thrombin Cleavage Capture Kit (Novagen) to release free DOHH enzymes. The enzyme was equilibrated in buffer A for activity assays, in high performance liquid chromatography water for metal analysis, or 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for analysis of CD spectra. DOHH Assays—A typical DOHH reaction mixture contained 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm DTT, 25 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 pmol (∼4 × 104 dpm) of the radiolabeled protein substrate, human or S. cerevisiae eIF5A([3H]Dhp), and the indicated amounts of purified human or S. cerevisiae enzymes in 20 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, 500 μg of carrier bovine serum albumin was added to each sample, followed by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitates were hydrolyzed in 0.4 ml of 6 n HCl for 18 h at 110 °C. The radiolabeled deoxyhypusine and hypusine in the acid hydrolysate were separated by ion-exchange chromatography as described (13Clement P.M. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Wolff E.C. Kleinman H.K. Park M.H.

Combined Deoxyhypusine Synthase/Deoxyhypusine Hydroxylase Assays—To test truncated eIF5A polypeptides as substrates for DOHH, the BL21(DE3) lysates expressing fragments of eIF5A precursor, eIF5A(Lys), were used as substrates for DHS/DOHH assays under conditions optimized for the two purified human recombinant enzymes. The reaction mixture in 40 μl contained 0.125 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.5, 6 mm DTT, 1 mm NAD, 6 μCi of [3H]spermidine, 0.2 μg of DHS, and 0.5 μg of DOHH and BL21(DE3) lysate containing 1-10 μg of intact or truncated forms of eIF5A(Lys). After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was used for SDS-PAGE for fluorographic detection of radiolabeled peptides. To the rest, 500 μg of carrier bovine serum albumin was added and the proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid containing polyamines (1 mm putrescine, spermidine, and spermine). After removal of [3H]spermidine by repeated washing with 10% trichloroacetic acid containing unlabeled polyamines, the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were hydrolyzed and the radiolabeled hypusine and deoxyhypusine were measured as described above. GST Pulldown Assays—BL21(DE3) cells (10 ml) transformed with pGEX-4T-3 empty vector (encoding GST), or pGEX-4T-3 vectors encoding human DOHH wild type or mutant enzymes as GST fusion proteins were cultured and the protein expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 3 h. The cells were sonicated in 0.2 ml of Buffer A containing protease inhibitor mixture, and the clarified supernatant was obtained after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. To the clarified supernatant (0.1 ml) containing ∼100 μg of GST, or GST-DOHH (wild type enzyme or mutant enzymes), 25 μl of washed GSH-Sepharose beads were added and the mixture rotated for >1 h at 4 °C. Then 1 μg of eIF5A(Lys), eIF5A(Dhp), or eIF5A(Hpu) was added to the mixture and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. After adsorption, the beads were washed with Buffer B three times using spin modules. The GSH-Sepharose-bound proteins were eluted with 40 μl of Buffer C. An aliquot was used for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for detection of co-purified eIF5A. For binding assays of the truncated eIF5A peptides, 3H-labeled eIF5A(Dhp) peptides were prepared from BL21(DE3) lysates expressing fragments of the eIF5A precursor, by the DHS reaction. The reaction mixture (40 μl) containing 0.2 m glycine·NaOH buffer, pH 9.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NAD, 6 μCi of [3H]spermidine, and 1 μl of protease inhibitor mixture, and cell lysate containing 1-10 μg of intact or the truncated forms of eIF5A(Lys) and 0.4 μg of DHS was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was used for estimation of [3H]deoxyhypusine formed. A reaction mixture containing 100,000 dpm (∼5 pmol) of each labeled peptide was used for the GST pulldown assay as described above and the amount of bound labeled peptide was estimated. Cross-reactivity of Human and Yeast Deoxyhypusine Hydroxylase with Heterologous Substrates—In the S. cerevisiae strain in which both of the yeast eIF5A genes (TIF51A and TIF51B) are disrupted, human eIF5A (both isoforms, eIF5A-1 and eIF5A-2) can complement the yeast protein (28Schwelberger H.G.

FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1102-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting a functional conservation of eIF5A throughout eukaryotic evolution. Deoxyhypusine synthases from human, rat, or yeast, whereas being strictly specific for eIF5A, displayed cross-reactivity toward heterologous substrates in vitro (3Joe Y.A. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22386-22392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Kang K.R. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. Chung S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18408-18412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Likewise, human and S. cerevisiae deoxyhypusine hydroxylases also exhibit cross-reactivity with heterologous substrate proteins. As shown in Table 1, The Km values of the human enzyme were 0.065 and 0.376 μm toward human and yeast eIF5A(Dhp), respectively: those for the yeast DOHH were 0.022 and 0.054 μm, respectively, for the human and yeast substrate. Whereas the Vmax values were comparable for the two enzymes with either of the two substrates, the specific activities of the purified recombinant enzymes were quite low (∼23.7 and 29.4 of pmol/h/μg of protein for the human and yeast enzymes, respectively).TABLE 1Kinetic constants for human and yeast deoxyhypusine hydroxylasesEnzymeSubstrateKmVmaxμMnM/hHuman DOHHHuman 5A(Dhp)0.065 ± 0.007456.8 ± 1.2Human DOHHYeast 5A(Dhp)0.376 ± 0.09061.5 ± 5.1Yeast DOHHHuman 5A(Dhp)0.022 ± 0.002938.9 ± 0.76Yeast DOHHYeast 5A(Dhp)0.054 ± 0.0008649.2 ± 0.20 Open table in a new tab The Specific Recognition of eIF5A(Dhp) by DOHH Revealed by Activity Assays—We first determined if unmodified precursor, eIF5A(Lys), or fully modified hypusine-containing protein, eIF5A(Hpu), could interfere with hydroxylation of the radiolabeled deoxyhypusine protein, eIF5A([3H]Dhp) by DOHH. When eIF5A(Lys) or eIF5A(Hpu) was added to the reaction mixture containing 2 pmol (34 ng) of radiolabeled eIF5A(Dhp), little or no inhibition was observed with eIF5A(Lys) even at 2.5 μg (75-fold excess). This finding indicates that the eIF5A precursor does not inhibit binding of the substrate protein to DOHH. Mature eIF5A, the hypusine-containing protein, caused a small inhibition of deoxyhypusine hydroxylation, suggesting that eIF5A(Hpu), the product of the DOHH reaction, does not effectively compete with eIF5A(Dhp) for binding to DOHH. In contrast, addition of unlabeled eIF5A(Dhp) sharply reduced the level of radioactive hypusine formed, obviously by dilution of the specific radioactivity of the substrate protein. The results demonstrate the importance of the deoxyhypusine side chain of eIF5A(Dhp) for recognition and modification by DOHH. Specificity of the Interaction between eIF5A and DOHH Revealed by GST Pulldown Assays—The specificity of interaction between eIF5A(Dhp) and DOHH was also examined by pulldown experiments using GST-DOHH (Fig. 2). Clarified lysates from BL21(DE3) cells overexpressing GST (Fig. 2, lanes 1, 3, and 5), or GST-DOHH wild type enzyme (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 4, and 6), were used for the pulldown of eIF5A(Lys) (lanes 1 and 2), eIF5A(Dhp) (lanes 3 and 4), or eIF5A(Hpu) (lanes 5 and 6). The bottom panel (Ponceau S staining of the blotted membrane) shows that almost equal amounts of GST or GST-DOHH enzymes were applied for Western analysis of co-purified eIF5A (top panel) using a monoclonal antibody that reacts with all three forms of eIF5A equally well. Whereas there was no eIF5A associated with the GST purified by GSH affinity resins (negative control, lanes 1, 3, and 5), a strong eIF5A signal was associated with the GST-DOHH pulled down in the presence of the deoxyhypusine-containing form, eIF5A(Dhp) (lane 4), indicating a high affinity binding of the two proteins. In contrast, eIF5A(Lys) was barely detectable in the GST-DOHH purified in a parallel manner (lanes 2). In accordance with the lack of inhibition of the DOHH reaction by eIF5A(Lys) (Fig. 1), the failure of the eIF5A precursor to associate with GST-DOHH suggests a requirement for the 4"

https://openalex.org/W2072301296,"In this work, we examined the regulation by GTP and UTP of the UMP kinases from eight bacterial species. The enzyme from Gram-positive organisms exhibited cooperative kinetics with ATP as substrate. GTP decreased this cooperativity and increased the affinity for ATP. UTP had the opposite effect, as it decreased the enzyme affinity for ATP. The nucleotide analogs 5-bromo-UTP and 5-iodo-UTP were 5–10 times stronger inhibitors than the parent compound. On the other hand, UMP kinases from the Gram-negative organisms did not show cooperativity in substrate binding and catalysis. Activation by GTP resulted mainly from the reversal of inhibition caused by excess UMP, and inhibition by UTP was accompanied by a strong increase in the apparent Km for UMP. Altogether, these results indicate that, depending on the bacteria considered, GTP and UTP interact with different enzyme recognition sites. In Gram-positive bacteria, GTP and UTP bind to a single site or largely overlapping sites, shifting the T ⇄ R equilibrium to either the R or T form, a scenario corresponding to almost all regulatory proteins, commonly called K systems. In Gram-negative organisms, the GTP-binding site corresponds to the unique allosteric site of the Gram-positive bacteria. In contrast, UTP interacts cooperatively with a site that overlaps the catalytic center, i.e. the UMP-binding site and part of the ATP-binding site. These characteristics make UTP an original regulator of UMP kinases from Gram-negative organisms, beyond the common scheme of allosteric control.

The residues essential for binding nucleotide substrates and catalysis are conserved among all bacterial UMP kinases (Fig. 1) (3Labesse G. Bucurenci N. Douguet D. Sakamoto H. Landais S. Gagyi C.

Salahbey Hocini K. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) indicated significant differences in their kinetic properties particularly in their regulation by nucleotides. Unlike the E. coli enzyme, UMP kinase from S. pneumoniae exhibited cooperative kinetics with respect to ATP, and its activation by GTP resulted in a decrease in cooperativity and an increase in affinity for ATP. To substantiate and eventually extend these observations to other UMP kinases from Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria, the corresponding pyrH genes were cloned, and the recombinant proteins were studied for their kinetic properties in both forward and reverse reactions. Thus, GTP and UTP are so far effectors for all the investigated UMP kinases. They act on the kinetic parameters mostly via conformational changes induced in the protein. Consequently, the regulating effects of GTP and UTP on UMP kinases from both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms are strongly related to the quaternary structures of these proteins. Chemicals—Nucleotides, restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, Vent and Tfu DNA polymerases, and coupling enzymes were purchased from Roche Applied Science, New England Biolabs, Qbiogene Inc., or Sigma.

The reaction medium in the forward direction contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4); 50 mm KCl; 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate; 0.2 mm NADH; 2 units each of lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and NDP kinase; and various concentrations of MgCl2, ATP, and UMP. The UMP kinase appropriately diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) was then added, and the decrease in absorbance was recorded at 340 nm. The reaction medium in the reverse direction contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4); 50 mm KCl; 1 mm glucose; 0.4 mm NADP+; 2 units each of hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; and various concentrations of MgCl2, ADP, and UDP. The appropriately diluted UMP kinase was then added, and the increase in absorbance was recorded at 340 nm. One unit of UMP kinase corresponds to 1 μmol of product formed per min. The thermal stability of UMP kinases was tested by incubating the purified enzymes (1 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 or 8.5) containing 0.1 m NaCl at a temperature between 30 °C and 80 °C for 10 min in the presence or absence of various nucleotides. The results (expressed as the percentage of residual activity compared with non-incubated controls) were used to calculate the temperature of half-inactivation (Tm). Calculation of Magnesium·Nucleotide Complexes and Kinetic Data Analysis—The concentration of MgCl2 in the assay medium in which coexisted nucleotides differing in the number of phosphate units was found to be critical for several reasons. The dissociation constant (Kd) of metal·nucleotide complexes varies within 2 orders of magnitude from 0.1 mm for MgNTP, 1 mm for MgNDP, and 20 mm for MgNMP (18Alberty R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1337-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Alberty R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3290-3302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, as some nucleotides played multiple roles, this resulted in mixed kinetic effects. Numerical simulations with different concentrations of MgCl2 and nucleotides showed that an acceptable compromise in the forward reaction was to use a 2 mm excess of MgCl2 above the concentration of NTPs. Thus, for the range of ATP (0.2–25 mm) and UMP (0.1–2 mm) concentrations used in most experiments, MgATP represented 95.7 ± 0.9% of the total ATP, and magnesium-free UMP represented 89.6 ± 2% of the total UMP (Table 2). Furthermore, the free metal ion (between 1.8 and 2.8 mm) was held at a sufficiently high but non-inhibitory concentration. For the sake of simplicity, the calculation of the kinetic constants in the forward reaction employed the actual concentration of various nucleotides. In this case, a Km or K0.5 of 2 mm for ATP corresponds approximately to a Km for MgATP of 1.9 mm. Similarly, a Km for UMP of 0.1 mm corresponds approximately to a Km of 0.09 mm for magnesium-free UMP. In the reverse reaction, the concentration of MgCl2 (millimolar) was related to the concentrations of UDP and ADP (or GDP when present) by the following relationship: [MgCl2]t = 4 + 0.8 [NDP]t. Under these conditions, the concentration of MgNDPs represented 80% of the total nucleotide concentration, and the concentration of free magnesium cation was always 4 mm. When GMP or GMP-PNP was used, this relation changed as follows: [MgCl2]t = 4 + 0.8 [NDP]t + 0.1 [NMP]t and [MgCl2]t = 4 + 0.8 [NDP]t + [NTP]t, respectively. With these empirical adjustments, the [MgNDP]/[NDP]t ratio varied by <1%, whereas the concentration of MgNTP represented 98% of the total NTP.TABLE 2Concentrations (millimolar) of free (ATPf and UMPf) and metal-complexed (MgATP and MgUMP) nucleotides as a function of their total concentrations (ATPo and UMPo) and the total concentration of MgCl2 (Mgo) The dissociation constants (Kd) of MgATP and MgUMP complexes (0.1 and 20 mm, respectively) were taken from Alberty (18Alberty R.A.

The accuracy of the constants calculated by these fittings (on average, they varied within ±10%) depended on the experimental errors (protein concentration and stability, purity of the commercially available nucleotides, and efficiency of the coupling enzymes in the assay system) and the computed concentration of the “active” metal-free or metal-complexed nucleotides from the corresponding dissociation constants.

We assumed that the His tag does not affect the activity of other bacterial UMP kinases. Gel permeation chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 and ultracentrifugation by sedimentation equilibrium confirmed that all variants exist as hexamers. Table 3 indicates the specific activity of UMP kinases from eight bacterial species at a single concentration of UMP (1 mm) and GTP (0.5 mm) and at two concentrations of ATP (2 and 8 mm). The highest concentration of nucleotides (8 mm ATP, 1 mm UMP, and 0.5 mm GTP) was selected arbitrarily to reach the maximal activity for all bacterial species. In Gram-negative organisms (E. coli, S. typhimurium, H. influenzae, and N. meningitidis), the ratio of UMP kinase activity in the presence and absence of GTP was practically independent of the concentration of ATP, whereas in Gram-positive organisms (B. subtilis, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and E. faecalis), the activating effect of GTP was much higher at a low concentration of ATP. Further kinetic analysis of UMP kinases from various species clarified the origin of this difference.TABLE 3UMP kinase activities of eight different bacterial strains in the absence and presence of GTP (0.5 mm) at a single concentration of UMP (1 mm) and two concentrations of ATP The reaction rates are expressed as units/mg of protein.Microorganism2 mm ATP8 mm ATP–GTP+GTPRatio–GTP+GTPRatioE. coli26.165.92.5228.171.12.53S. typhimurium46.8134.32.8747.5124.22.61H. influenzae9.152.85.8011.860.55.73N. meningitidis5.157.711.3010.2103.110.11B. subtilis2.728.610.6018.139.12.16S. pneumoniae3.768.518.5038.987.42.24S. aureus4.623.55.1012.823.61.84E. faecalis1.79.75.719.119.42.13 Open table in a new tab Dependence of UMP Kinase Activity on ATP Concentration—E. coli and S. typhimurium UMP kinases were shown to exhibit hyperbolic dependence of activity as a function of ATP concentration in both the absence and presence of GTP (1Serina L.

H. influenzae UMP kinase slightly deviates from this rule, as the kinetics with ATP as variable substrate were best fitted by the Hill equation. However, the nH values did not exceed 1.30 (Table 4). In the case of UMP kinases from the Gram-positive bacteria, the plot of activity versus the concentration of ATP was clearly sigmoidal in the absence of GTP, with nH varying from 1.7 for S. aureus, 2.0 for B. subtilis, and 2.5 for S. pneumoniae. In the presence of GTP, the cooperativity index decreased to almost 1.00, and the K0.5 for ATP decreased by a factor of 3 for S. aureus and 8 for B. subtilis and S. pneumoniae.

In the presence of GTP, the plot of activity versus the concentration of nucleoside monophosphate became hyperbolic. The calculated Vm values using the two different plots are closely similar, suggesting that the major effect of GTP on E. coli UMP kinase with UMP as variable substrate is the reversal of inhibition caused by excess nucleoside monophosphate. The H. influenzae and N. meningitidis UMP kinases exhibited similar properties; nevertheless, for the latter enzyme, GTP increased also significantly the Vm (Table 5). The “Vm” effect of GTP on N. meningitidis UMP kinase was also demonstrated by measuring its activity at several constant concentrations of ATP and at variable concentrations of UMP in both the absence and presence of GTP. The calculated VmUMP from each individual experiments was plotted as a function of ATP concentration (Fig. 2A).

In the absence of activator and at concentrations of ATP below the K0.5, inhibition by excess UMP was also observed (Table 5). Moreover, the Km for UMP increased significantly from low to saturating concentrations of ATP or in the presence of GTP, suggesting a complex relationship between the substrates and regulatory nucleotide. To minimize the effect of one substrate or effector on the kinetic parameters of the second substrate, the activity of B. subtilis UMP kinase was determined as described for N. meningitidis UMP kinase at several constant concentrations of ATP and at variable concentrations of UMP in both the absence and presence of saturating concentrations of GTP. Each individual series was fitted by Equation 2, and the calculated VmUMP (Fig. 2B) values were used for secondary plots with ATP as variable substrate. The resulting constants ( VmATP/UMP, K0.5ATP, and nH) were 68 units/mg of protein, 21 mm, and 1.8 in the absence of GTP and 58 units/mg of protein, 2.9 mm, and 1.1 in its presence, respectively.

These Ki values increased at low and high pH with pKa values of ∼4.0 and ∼10.5, respectively. By using surface plasmon resonance, we show that the apparent association rate constant for Z-Ala-Pro-Phe-glyoxal is much lower than the value expected for a diffusion-controlled reaction. 13C NMR has been used to show that at low pH the glyoxal keto carbon is sp3-hybridized with a chemical shift of ∼100.7 ppm and that the aldehyde carbon is hydrated with a chemical shift of ∼91.6 ppm. The signal at ∼100.7 ppm is assigned to the hemiketal formed between the hydroxy group of serine 195 and the keto carbon of the glyoxal. In a slow exchange process controlled by a pKa of ∼4.5, the aldehyde carbon dehydrates to give a signal at ∼205.5 ppm and the hemiketal forms an oxyanion at ∼107.0 ppm. At higher pH, the re-hydration of the glyoxal aldehyde carbon leads to the signal at 107 ppm being replaced by a signal at 104 ppm (pKa ∼9.2). On binding either Z-Ala-Pro-Phe-glyoxal or Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-glyoxal to α-chymotrypsin at 4 and 25 °C, 1H NMR is used to show that the binding of these glyoxal inhibitors raises the pKa value of the imidazolium ion of histidine 57 to a value of >11 at both 4 and 25 °C. We discuss the mechanistic significance of these results, and we propose that it is ligand binding that raises the pKa value of the imidazolium ring of histidine 57 allowing it to enhance the nucleophilicity of the hydroxy group of the active site serine 195 and lower the pKa value of the oxyanion forming a zwitterionic tetrahedral intermediate during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2020382054,"The crystal structure of the W47A/W242A mutant of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> has been solved to 1.8Å resolution. The W47A/W242A mutant is an interfacially challenged enzyme, and it has been proposed that one or both tryptophan side chains serve as membrane interfacial anchors (Feng, J., Wehbi, H., and Roberts, M. F. (2002) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 277, 19867-19875). The crystal structure supports this hypothesis. Relative to the crystal structure of the closely related (97% identity) wild-type PI-PLC from <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, significant conformational differences occur at the membrane-binding interfacial region rather than the active site. The Trp → Ala mutations not only remove the membrane-partitioning aromatic side chains but also perturb the conformations of the so-called helix B and rim loop regions, both of which are implicated in interfacial binding. The crystal structure also reveals a homodimer, the first such observation for a bacterial PI-PLC, with pseudo-2-fold symmetry. The symmetric dimer interface is stabilized by hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, contributed primarily by a central swath of aromatic residues arranged in a quasiherringbone pattern. Evidence that interfacially active wild-type PI-PLC enzymes may dimerize in the presence of phosphatidylcholine vesicles is provided by fluorescence quenching of PI-PLC mutants with pyrene-labeled cysteine residues. The combined data suggest that wild-type PI-PLC can form similar homodimers, anchored to the interface by the tryptophan and neighboring membrane-partitioning residues."
https://openalex.org/W2121154536,"Aberrant expression of the human homeobox-containing proto-oncogene TLX1/HOX11 inhibits hematopoietic differentiation programs in a number of murine model systems. Here, we report the establishment of a murine erythroid progenitor cell line, iEBHX1S-4, developmentally arrested by regulatable TLX1 expression. Extinction of TLX1 expression released the iEBHX1S-4 differentiation block, allowing erythropoietin-dependent acquisition of erythroid markers and hemoglobin synthesis. Coordinated activation of erythroid transcriptional networks integrated by the acetyltransferase co-activator CREB-binding protein (CBP) was suggested by bioinformatic analysis of the upstream regulatory regions of several conditionally induced iEBHX1S-4 gene sets. In accord with this notion, CBP-associated acetylation of GATA-1, an essential regulator of erythroid differentiation, increased concomitantly with TLX1 downregulation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays revealed that TLX1 directly binds to CBP, and confocal laser microscopy demonstrated that the two proteins partially colocalize at intranuclear sites in iEBHX1S-4 cells. Notably, the distribution of CBP in conditionally blocked iEBHX1S-4 cells partially overlapped with chromatin marked by a repressive histone methylation pattern, and downregulation of TLX1 coincided with exit of CBP from these heterochromatic regions. Thus, we propose that TLX1-mediated differentiation arrest may be achieved in part through a mechanism that involves redirection of CBP and/or its sequestration in repressive chromatin domains."

In LAP2 proteins, a LEM-like segment at the very N terminus has been shown to interact with DNA directly (8Cai M. Huang Y. Ghirlando R. Wilson K.L. Craigie R. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4399-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The family of LAP2 proteins includes six alternatively spliced isoforms derived from the same gene (9Dechat T. Vlcek S. Foisner R. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Most LAP2 isoforms are closely related structurally and functionally and are localized to the inner nuclear membrane, such as LAP2β. In contrast, LAP2α shares only the N-terminal 187 amino acids with the other isoforms, including the LEM and LEM-like domains, but otherwise possesses a unique 506-amino-acid C-terminal region without a transmembrane domain (see Fig. 1A), encoded by one large exon found only in mammals (10Prufert K. Vogel A. Krohne G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6105-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). LAP2α is exclusively located in the nucleoplasm in interphase and interacts with lamin A/C (11Dechat T. Korbei B. Vaughan O.A. Vlcek S. Hutchison C.J. Foisner R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3473-3484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb) via distinct C-terminal domains (12Dorner D. Vlcek S. Foeger N. Gajewski A. Makolm C.

Cell. 2002; 13: 4401-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The LAP2α-lamin A/C-pRb complex is thought to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation in adult stem cells (3Gotzmann J. Foisner R. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 125: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Dorner D. Vlcek S. Foeger N. Gajewski A. Makolm C. Gotzmann J. Hutchison C.J. Foisner R. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). During mitosis, LAP2α dissociates from chromosomes in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and is redistributed throughout the mitotic cytoplasm, like most nuclear lamina components (14Dechat T. Gajewski A. Korbei B. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Haraguchi T. Furukawa K. Ellenberg J. Foisner R. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6117-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 15Gajewski A. Csaszar E. Foisner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35813-35821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, during anaphase, LAP2α associates with the telomeres of separated sister chromatids and subsequently forms stable structures associated with decondensing chromatin before the nuclear envelope is formed (14Dechat T. Gajewski A. Korbei B. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Haraguchi T. Furukawa K. Ellenberg J. Foisner R. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6117-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although LAP2α can interact with BAF and DNA via its common LEM and LEM-like motifs, its C terminus was shown to be essential and sufficient for chromatin association during mitosis (16Vlcek S. Just H. Dechat T. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6370-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Vlcek S. Korbei B. Foisner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18898-18907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a mutation causing an amino acid substitution (Arg-690 to Cys) near the C terminus of LAP2α has been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (18Taylor M.R. Slavov D. Gajewski A. Vlcek S. Ku L. Fain P.R. Carniel E. Di Lenarda A. Sinagra G. Boucek M.M. Cavanaugh J. Graw S.L. Ruegg P. Feiger J. Zhu X. Ferguson D.A. Bristow M.R. Gotzmann J. Foisner R. Mestroni L. Hum. Mutat. 2005; 26: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), a condition also known to be caused by mutations in the LMNA gene (5Burke B. Stewart C.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The mutation altered the observed LAP2α interaction with A-type lamins in vitro and may represent a rare cause of DCM. In this study, we show that LAP2α is engaged in homo-oligomerization via its unique C-terminal domain and forms stable trimers in vivo and in vitro. These homo-trimers may be the building blocks of higher order structures containing LAP2α and other proteins. Reagents—Mouse monoclonal anti-LAP2 (6E10) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antibodies were obtained from Abcam. Rabbit anti-LAP2α antiserum and monoclonal anti-LAP2α antibody 15/2 and 12 were described (16Vlcek S. Just H. Dechat T. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6370-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Vlcek S. Korbei B. Foisner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18898-18907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies were from Clontech; polyclonal anti-DsRed antibody was from BD Biosciences; anti-protein C affinity matrix (mouse monoclonal antibody HPC4, immobilized) and mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10) were from Roche Diagnostics; protein G-agarose conjugate was from Sigma. Vector Construction and Expression of Recombinant Proteins—cDNA coding for monomeric red fluorescent protein 1 (mRFP1) was amplified from pRSETB-mRFP1 (a kind gift of Dr. R. Tsien, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Diego, CA) and inserted into the vector pCI (Promega). The resulting plasmid was used to create N-terminally tagged mRFP1-LAP2α and mRFP1-LAP2α-(188–693) by ligating amplified fragments of LAP2α in-frame with mRFP1. mRFP1-LAP2α and mRFP1-LAP2α-(188–693) were then excised and ligated blunt into the EcoRV site of eukaryotic expression vector pEF-puro.PL3 (19Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17221-17226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Plasmids pEF.mRFP1-LAP2α and pEF.mRFP1-LAP2α-(188–693) were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and clones were selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin. For the construction of PC-Myc-mRFP1-LAP2α-(188–693) and PC-Myc-LAP2α-(188–693), a sequence coding for protein C epitope EDQVDPRLIDGK fused to the Myc-tag EKLISEEDL was inserted into the EcoRV site of pEF-puro.PL3. The resulting plasmid was linearized with EcoRV and ligated in-frame with mRFP1-LAP2α-(188–693) or LAP2α-(188–693). For GFP-LAP2α carrying the DCM mutation, vector gAG43 was constructed by shuttling wild-type LAP2α cDNAs from gAG41 (18Taylor M.R. Slavov D. Gajewski A. Vlcek S. Ku L. Fain P.R. Carniel E. Di Lenarda A. Sinagra G. Boucek M.M. Cavanaugh J. Graw S.L. Ruegg P. Feiger J. Zhu X. Ferguson D.A. Bristow M.R. Gotzmann J. Foisner R. Mestroni L. Hum. Mutat. 2005; 26: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) into GFP destination vector pcDNA-DEST53 by the LR reaction (Invitrogen). The bacterial expression vectors encoding His-tagged LAP2α fragments are described elsewhere (16Vlcek S. Just H. Dechat T. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6370-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For bacterial expression, proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) using the inducible T7 RNA polymerase-dependent pET vector system as described previously (11Dechat T. Korbei B. Vaughan O.A. Vlcek S. Hutchison C.J. Foisner R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3473-3484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Vlcek S. Just H. Dechat T. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6370-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 5 min (Heraeus Megafuge, 1.0R) and lysed in one-tenth of the original culture volume of Tris buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors) by freezing and thawing and the addition of 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml DNase, and 20 μg/ml RNase. Following a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm, and pellets were resuspended in one-tenth of the original culture volume of Tris buffer plus 7 m urea and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 30 min, and supernatants were stored as aliquots at -20 °C. If fragments were soluble, urea was added directly to the cell extract prior to centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. Renaturation of recombinant proteins was achieved by dialyzing twice against KHM buffer (78 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 8.4 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and cleared by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 5 min. For light scattering, full-length LAP2α was expressed in E. coli strain Rosetta 2 (DE3) (Novagen) grown in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin at 30 °C. Expression was induced at an A600 = 0.6 by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cultures were further grown at 20 °C for 20 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,500 × g and 4 °C. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), containing 50 μg/ml DNase and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and sonicated. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation and filtering, and the resulting supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-chelating HiTrap column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in lysis buffer. Upon serial column washes of buffer supplemented with 50 mm imidazole, the protein was eluted in 300 mm imidazole. The elutant was subjected to gel filtration in buffer supplemented with 10 mm DTT (Superdex 200, HiLoad 16/60 PG; GE Healthcare). The protein so obtained was pure according to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting—Cell extracts in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were blocked for 60 min in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 5% nonfat dry milk, incubated with primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min and with anti-mouse (Sigma) or anti-rabbit (DAKO) alkaline phosphatase-conjugate, and visualized using BM purple AP substrate, (Roche Diagnostics). Semi-native gels contained SDS only in the running buffer (0.1% SDS); no SDS was present in the sample buffer or the polyacrylamide gels themselves. Immunoprecipitations—Confluent cell monolayers in 10-cm dishes were lysed in TNCT (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Ca2+, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g. Supernatants were incubated with 25 μl of anti-protein C matrix for 1 h. Bound complexes were washed four times with TNCT and eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were processed for immunoblotting. Alternatively, supernatants were divided in two parts; one half was incubated on ice with monoclonal anti-Myc (2 μg) or monoclonal anti-LAP2 (15 μg) antibody, and the other half was incubated with a control monoclonal antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-HRV2, a kind gift of Dr. Blaas, Max Perutz Laboratories, Vienna, Austria) for 30 min. Immunocomplexes were bound to 12.5 μl of protein G-agarose for 1 h, washed with TNCT, and eluted in sample buffer. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and quenched in 50 mm NH4Cl. They were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked in 5% fetal calf serum, and incubated with monoclonal anti-Myc antibody at 1 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal calf serum. The secondary antibody was anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes). Preparations were mounted using Citifluor AP1 (PLANO) and examined with a Nikon Eclipse 800 fluorescent microscope. Chemical Cross-linking—HeLa cells were resuspended in KHM buffer and homogenized on ice by pressing the suspension 10–15 times through a metal ball cracker (European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg, Germany). Cell lysates and dialyzed recombinant proteins were mixed with various concentrations of cross-linking agent dithiobis-(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP, Pierce) for 2 h on ice, and the reaction was stopped by quenching free active groups with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, for 1 h on ice. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of 100 mm DTT. Blot Overlay Assays—Recombinant polypeptides were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes as described (11Dechat T. Korbei B. Vaughan O.A. Vlcek S. Hutchison C.J. Foisner R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3473-3484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were stained with Ponceau S, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated in overlay buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT) for 1 h. After blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin in overlay buffer, membranes were probed 3 h with [35S]methionine-labeled polypeptides diluted 1:50 in overlay buffer plus 1% bovine serum albumin. Membranes were washed extensively with overlay buffer, and bound proteins were detected by autoradiography. In Vitro Transcription/Translation and GFP Immunoprecipitation—150 μl of protein A-Sepharose were coupled overnight with 6 μl of polyclonal anti-GFP antibody and 150 μl of protein G-Sepharose with 1 ml of monoclonal anti-LAP2 antibody 12. 35S-labeled wild-type or mutated LAP2α was expressed by in vitro transcription/translation using the TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation reaction mix (Promega) either alone or together with GFP-tagged wild-type LAP2α (gAG49, gAG49 and gAG43, gAG50, gAG50 and gAG43). After incubation at 30 °C for 3 h, binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added to 225 μl. For preclearing, samples were incubated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose for 15 min and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 3 min. Supernatants were incubated with antibody-coupled beads (see above) for 2 h at 4 °C, and beads were centrifuged through a 30% sucrose cushion. Supernatants and beads were mixed with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Size Exclusion Chromatography Combined with Multiangle Light Scattering (SEC-MALS)—The oligomeric state of LAP2α in solution was determined by SEC-MALS measurements performed on an ÁKTA explorer 10 system (GE Healthcare) connected to a tri-angle light scattering detector and a differential refractometer (miniDAWN Tristar and Optilab, respectively; Wyatt Technology). A Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) was equilibrated in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. A sample volume of 100 μl was injected at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Data were processed using ASTRA software (Wyatt Technology) assuming a specific refractive index increment (dn/dc) of 0.185 ml/g. To determine the detector delay volumes and the normalization coefficients for the MALS detector, a bovine serum albumin sample (Pierce) was used as reference. Neither despiking nor band broadening correction was applied. The C Terminus of LAP2α Is Involved in the Formation of Oligomeric Complexes in Vivo—Our previous studies revealed the formation of stable, chromatin-associated LAP2α structures during early nuclear assembly stages (14Dechat T. Gajewski A. Korbei B. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Haraguchi T. Furukawa K. Ellenberg J. Foisner R. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6117-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 17Vlcek S. Korbei B. Foisner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18898-18907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), indicating oligomerization of the protein. To analyze oligomeric LAP2α structures in vivo and to determine the domain of LAP2α responsible for oligomerization, either full-length LAP2α or the LAP2α-specific C-terminal domain, LAP2α-(188–693), fused to the C terminus of monomeric red fluorescent protein 1 (mRFP1) (Fig. 1A), were stably expressed in HeLa cells. Unlike GFP and DsRed, mRFP1 remains entirely monomeric and therefore precludes misinterpretations of LAP2α oligomerization due to dimerization or tetramerization of the tag (20Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses of cell extracts prepared from stable cell clones revealed the presence of fusion proteins of expected sizes, in amounts comparable with that of the endogenous LAP2α (Fig. 1B, left panel). Both constructs reacted with polyclonal antibodies against LAP2α C terminus (anti-LAP2α)) and antibodies against red fluorescent protein (anti-RFP), whereas a monoclonal antibody directed against the N-terminal region of LAP2α that is common to all LAP2 isoforms recognized only mRFP1-LAP2α plus the endogenous protein (anti-LAP2). Both mRFP1-LAP2α and mRFP1-LAP2α-(188–693) were readily extracted in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 130 mm NaCl (Fig. 1B, left panel). However, although a small fraction of endogenous LAP2α and of mRFP1-LAP2α remained in the pellet fraction, mRFP1-LAP2α-(188–693) was completely soluble, indicating that full-length LAP2α is more tightly bound to nuclear complexes than the LAP2α C terminus. Next, we examined the cellular distribution of the tagged proteins at various stages of the cell cycle by using fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1C, both mRFP1-LAP2α-(188–693) and mRFP1-LAP2α localized to the nucleoplasm in interphase, to the cytoplasm in metaphase, and to chromatin in anaphase/telophase as reported previously for the endogenous protein and GFP-LAP2α (14Dechat T. Gajewski A. Korbei B. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Haraguchi T. Furukawa K. Ellenberg J. Foisner R. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6117-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 16Vlcek S. Just H. Dechat T. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6370-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Vlcek S. Korbei B. Foisner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18898-18907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Dechat T. Gotzmann J. Stockinger A. Harris C.A. Talle M.A. Siekierka J.J. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4887-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Unlike the full-length protein, a fraction of mRFP1-LAP2α-(188–693) remained in the cytoplasm during anaphase (Fig. 1C, arrow), again indicating a less stable integration of the C terminus to chromatin-associated structures as compared with full-length protein. Nevertheless, these data show that the C terminus is capable of interacting with chromatin or nuclear lamina components during nuclear assembly in vivo. To investigate whether the C terminus can also be incorporated into higher order LAP2α structures, we developed a co-immunoprecipitation approach. The mRFP1-LAP2α-(188–693) fusion protein was modified by adding a protein C-epitope and a Myc tag at the N terminus (PC-Myc-mRFP1-LAP2α-(188–693), Fig. 1A), facilitating efficient isolation of the fusion protein from cell extracts. In addition, we generated a fusion protein containing protein C-epitope and a Myc tag fused directly to the C terminus of LAP2α (PC-Myc-LAP2α-(188–693)). Upon stable transfection into HeLa cells, the fusion constructs were expressed at similar levels as endogenous LAP2α, as revealed by immunoblot analyses of cell extracts with anti-LAP2α and anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 1B, right panel). Both proteins behaved like mRFP1-LAP2α-(188–693) upon Triton extraction (Fig. 1B) and in immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1C). PC-Myc-mRFP1-LAP2α-(188–693) and PC-Myc-LAP2α-(188–693) were precipitated from Triton X-100-soluble cell fractions using the anti-protein C matrix (Fig. 2A). A protein of about 80 kDa reacting with the anti-LAP2 common domain antibody was consistently found in the immunoprecipitates from these clones but not in non-transfected HeLa cells or clones expressing unrelated constructs (Fig. 2A and data not shown). As the epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody is not present in the recombinant proteins, the 80-kDa protein could be unambiguously identified as the endogenous LAP2α protein. The other LAP2 isoforms were not coimmunoprecipitated (data not shown). Similarly, when the tagged LAP2α C terminus was precipitated with anti-Myc antibody, full-length LAP2α was detected in the immunoprecipitates, whereas a control antibody did not bring down any of those proteins (Fig. 2B). Likewise, unlike control antibodies, the anti-LAP2 common domain antibody co-precipitated PC-Myc-mRFP1-LAP2α-(188–693) and PC-Myc-LAP2α-(188–693) with the endogenous protein (Fig. 2C). Overall, our data demonstrate that the LAP2α-C terminus associated with full-length LAP2α in vivo, and indicate a role of the C-terminal region in higher order structure organization of LAP2α complexes. LAP2α Forms Stable Complexes of Defined Molecular Weight—To obtain further evidence for the existence of oligomeric LAP2α complexes, we chemically cross-linked protein complexes in a total HeLa cell lysate using DSP. DSP-mediated cross-links are stable in non-reducing conditions but can be removed by the addition of reducing agents. HeLa cell extracts treated with different concentrations of DSP were analyzed by reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody against the LAP2α-specific C terminus (Fig. 3A). Depending on the concentration of the cross-linking agent, LAP2α was detected in a complex with an apparent molecular mass larger than 200 kDa. When the cross-linking agent was cleaved by the addition of dithiothreitol, complexes were dissociated, yielding monomeric LAP2α. Intriguingly, semi-native, non-denaturing electrophoresis of HeLa cell lysates also revealed a LAP2α complex slightly larger than 200 kDa (Fig. 3A, left lane). Thus, LAP2α may exist in a stable complex of ∼200–250 kDa in vivo. To test whether LAP2α is able to form oligomeric complexes of similar sizes in vitro, we cross-linked highly enriched recombinant, bacterially expressed LAP2α. Immunoblot analyses revealed a LAP2α complex of more than 200 kDa in non-reducing conditions (Fig. 3A, -DTT), whereas mostly the monomeric protein of ∼80 kDa was detected in reducing conditions (Fig. 3B). Intriguingly, the C terminus of LAP2α-(188–693) also formed larger complexes in non-reducing conditions, whereas the N-terminal region (1–187) remained mostly monomeric under these conditions. Since both the N terminus and the C terminus contain lysine residues, which can be targeted by the cross-linker, we concluded that LAP2α forms higher order, oligomeric complexes through self-association of its C-terminal region. To further show the homo-oligomerization of LAP2α, we generated LAP2α by in vitro translation in a reticulocyte lysate and analyzed the complex by semi-native PAGE (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, a major band between 200 and 250 kDa was detected in addition to the 80-kDa monomer. Since the reticulocyte lysate does not contain any nuclear proteins, which may be specific interaction partners for LAP2α, it is very likely that the >200-kDa complex represented homo-oligomeric LAP2α complexes. The LAP2α Self-interaction Is Mediated by the C-terminal Region—Our data suggest direct interaction of LAP2α C-terminal regions mediating homo-oligomerization of the protein. To further demonstrate that self-interaction of LAP2α polypeptides occurs via the C terminus, we performed additional in vitro binding assays. Bacterially expressed full-length LAP2α (1–693), LAP2α C terminus (188–693), and LAP2 N terminus (1–187) were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a membrane, and overlaid with radioactively labeled in vitro translated full-length LAP2α or LAP2α C terminus. Autoradiography revealed binding of both labeled proteins to full-length LAP2α and to the C terminus, whereas the N terminus did not interact (Fig. 4A). Thus, only the C terminus of LAP2α can mediate self-interaction of the protein. To narrow down the self-interaction domain within the LAP2α C terminus, we expressed different fragments of LAP2α in bacteria and performed solid phase overlay assays with radioactively labeled, in vitro translated, full-length LAP2α or LAP2α C terminus. Results presented in Fig. 4B and summarized in Fig. 4C show that removal of 78 residues from the C terminus of LAP2α only moderately affected binding of the truncated protein to LAP2α and LAP2α C terminus, removal of the C-terminal 279 residues significantly reduced binding (for LAP2α C terminus to an undetectable level), and deletion of the last 439 residues abolished binding completely. On the other hand, the C-terminal 284 residues of LAP2α-(410–693) showed a binding that was slightly weaker than that of the entire C terminus (188–693). These results show that the extreme C-terminal domain of LAP2α-(410–693) has some binding affinity to the LAP2α C terminus, but strong interaction requires upstream regions between residues 254 and 410. Vimentin as a negative control did not interact with LAP2α. Purified Soluble LAP2α Is a Homo-trimeric Complex—Our results demonstrate a self-association of LAP2α, and cross-linking experiments revealed complexes of larger than 200 kDa, which suggests trimeric structures. To show the level of assembly of LAP2α in solution accurately, we performed SEC-MALS and refractive index measurements on soluble, purified samples of LAP2α. This technique yields an accurate determination of the molecular mass independent of molecular shape or hydrodynamic parameters. SEC-MALS data revealed that LAP2α migrates as a monodisperse molecule with an estimated molecular mass of 207.2 kDa (Fig. 5). Since the calculated theoretical mass of a LAP2α trimer is 226.0 kDa, this result shows that LAP2α exists as a stable homo-trimer in solution. It is also in accordance with the molecular mass observed in the cross-linking and the semi-native gel electrophoresis experiments (Fig. 3). The Self-association of LAP2α Is Not Affected by a Disease-linked Mutation—A mutation in the extreme C terminus of LAP2α has been linked to dilated cardiomyopathy in humans (18Taylor M.R. Slavov D. Gajewski A. Vlcek S. Ku L. Fain P.R. Carniel E. Di Lenarda A. Sinagra G. Boucek M.M. Cavanaugh J. Graw S.L. Ruegg P. Feiger J. Zhu X. Ferguson D.A. Bristow M.R. Gotzmann J. Foisner R. Mestroni L. Hum. Mutat. 2005; 26: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of this disease is currently unknown, but we have shown that the disease-linked mutation in LAP2α decreased its binding affinity for lamins A and C. Therefore, we wondered whether the mutation could also interfere with the self-association of LAP2α molecules and whether this could contribute to the cellular defect in patient cells. To test this hypothesis, GFP-LAP2α and untagged wild-type or disease-linked LAP2α variants were in vitro translated simultaneously using a reticulocyte extract, and LAP2α complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody. Immunoblot analyses using LAP2α antibodies detected untagged LAP2α in the immunoprecipitates only when GFP-LAP2α was present in the samples, whereas untagged protein alone was not precipitated by anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 6). These data clearly support the direct self-interaction of LAP2α molecules. Both wild-type and mutated LAP2α co-precipitated with GFP-LAP2α with similar efficiencies, indicating that the disease-linked mutation in LAP2α does not interfere with its self-association. The studies presented here revealed a so far unappreciated biochemical property of LAP2α, the formation of homo-oligomeric structures, and revealed the presence of LAP2α homotrimers in cell lysates and in solution in vitro. Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous LAP2α with exogenously expressed full-length LAP2α or different fusion proteins containing the α-specific C-terminal domain demonstrated that higher order LAP2α structures occur in living cells, are stable, and require the unique C terminus of the protein. Cross-linking of LAP2α complexes in cell lysates and size exclusion chromatography of purified LAP2α combined with multiangle light scattering measurements showed that LAP2α forms stable homo-trimers. LAP2α C Terminus Is Involved in Multiple Interactions—In vitro overlay experiments suggested that the homo-trimerization of LAP2α is mediated through the direct interaction of its C-terminal α-specific domain. Although the last 284 amino acids were sufficient for self-interaction in vitro, additional upstream regions within the unique LAP2α domain contribute to the formation of stable oligomers. The C terminus has been shown to contain several additional binding domains. The last 78 amino acids of LAP2α are involved in the interaction with lamin C (11Dechat T. Korbei B. Vaughan O.A. Vlcek S. Hutchison C.J. Foisner R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3473-3484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas further upstream regions mediate the interaction with pRb (12Dorner D. Vlcek S. Foeger N. Gajewski A. Makolm C. Gotzmann J. Hutchison C.J. Foisner R. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). One may argue that the binding regions of LAP2α for pRb, for lamin A/C, and for self-association may overlap and influence or even compete with each other. However, our observation that stable LAP2α trimers exist in the cell argues that these trimers form the building block of higher order LAP2α complexes. Thus, it is much more likely for a LAP2α trimer versus a monomer to interact simultaneously with pRb and lamin A/C and act as a platform for the assembly of transcriptional regulator complexes as proposed in previous studies (12Dorner D. Vlcek S. Foeger N. Gajewski A. Makolm C. Gotzmann J. Hutchison C.J. Foisner R. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, mutated LAP2α (R690C) expressed in the human disease DCM showed reduced binding to lamin A tail in vitro (18Taylor M.R. Slavov D. Gajewski A. Vlcek S. Ku L. Fain P.R. Carniel E. Di Lenarda A. Sinagra G. Boucek M.M. Cavanaugh J. Graw S.L. Ruegg P. Feiger J. Zhu X. Ferguson D.A. Bristow M.R. Gotzmann J. Foisner R. Mestroni L. Hum. Mutat. 2005; 26: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), whereas LAP2α self-association was not impaired by the R690C substitution. This observation is consistent with the results of overlay blots indicating a relatively broad interface of self-interaction between LAP2α monomers potentially involving several regions within its unique C terminus. Size of Stable Homo-oligomeric LAP2α Structures—Analysis of HeLa cell extracts after chemical cross-linking or in seminative non-denaturing gels showed the presence of stable LAP2α-containing complexes of molecular masses between 200 and 250 kDa. Complexes of the same size were detected after cross-linking of bacterially expressed LAP2α and by seminative PAGE of LAP2α expressed in reticulocyte lysate, indicating that LAP2α is the only protein in the 200–250-kDa complex. According to their size, these complexes might accommodate three LAP2α molecules of 75–80 kDa, suggesting that the protein exists as a homo-trimeric complex. Size exclusion chromatography combined with light scattering analyses of highly purified bacterially expressed LAP2α revealed a high monodispersity of the sample with a molecular mass consistent with a trimeric organization. Functional Implication of the LAP2α Self-interaction—By fluorescent microscopy, LAP2α C-terminal domain stably expressed in HeLa cells revealed a cellular distribution identical to that of endogenous LAP2α, except for anaphase-telophase, where it showed a slightly less efficient association with chromosomes. This observation supports previous findings, showing that the C terminus is required and sufficient for chromosome association of LAP2α during nuclear assembly (17Vlcek S. Korbei B. Foisner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18898-18907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The less efficient binding of LAP2α C terminus to chromatin also indicates that, although the C terminus is sufficient for targeting LAP2α to chromosomes, its stable association also requires the N-terminal common domain. However, based on the data presented here, we cannot rule out completely that the C-terminal fragment associated with chromosomes mainly through its interaction with full-length endogenous LAP2α during nuclear assembly in vivo. In any case, the engagement of LAP2α in a self-interaction has important implications for its previously reported functions. The formation of stable LAP2α trimers as basic building blocks for higher order structures clearly affects the chromatin binding properties of LAP2α. A trimer brings three LEM and LEM-like domains in close vicinity in a complex and generates multiple binding sites for BAF and DNA, thus significantly increasing the affinity of the complex for chromatin. Secondly, the N termini of the oligomeric complex could interact simultaneously with several DNA fibers and thus perform efficient cross-linking of chromatin regions. In line with this model, it was shown that full-length LAP2α and BAF are essential components of the preintegration complex of retroviruses (22Suzuki Y. Yang H. Craigie R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4670-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The proposed role of LAP2α in stabilizing the interaction of BAF with preintegration complexes required both the N-terminal common domain and the α-specific C-terminal domain of LAP2α. Our results, showing that the C terminus is the determinant for oligomerization of LAP2α, provide a possible explanation for this observation. Finally, the proposed role of LAP2α as a transcriptional regulator of E2F target genes (12Dorner D. Vlcek S. Foeger N. Gajewski A. Makolm C. Gotzmann J. Hutchison C.J. Foisner R. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) by forming complexes with pRb and lamin A/C can be better accomplished by a higher order structure, such as a trimer, than by a monomer. In conclusion, our data suggest a model where a homo-trimeric core complex of LAP2α, formed via self-association of the C-terminal domain, serves as the building block for higher order homo- and hetero-oligomeric structures of LAP2α that are involved in chromatin organization and in transcriptional regulation.
