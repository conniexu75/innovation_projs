https://openalex.org/W2014400130,"Isolated retinas from frogs' eyes were preserved in a circulating medium; transretinal electrical potential and ultraviolet absorbancy were monitored. In response to visible stimulation, changes in absorbancy were observed which correlate with the c-wave of the electroretinogram. They are tentatively identified as cyclic oxidations of pyridine nucleotides reflecting the energy expenditure associated with evoked neuronal activity."
https://openalex.org/W1997136487,Conditions have been found under which polynucleotide phosphorylase adds only a few nucleotide residues to the 3′ end of a dinucleotide primer. Pure tri- and tetranucleotides can be isolated from reaction mixtures in high yield.
https://openalex.org/W2003306186,"When microelectrodes are inserted in two cells of the same ommatidium in Limulus, current applied through the membrane of one cell produces a change in potential across the membrane of both cells. The large spikes recorded from one cell and the small spikes recorded from the other always appear synchronously. However, the small spikes are abolished selectively during the hyperpolarizing response. The discrete waves recorded from eyes adapted to darkness occur simultaneously in cells of the same ommatidium."

https://openalex.org/W1980437582,"Nascent protein synthesis is associated with polyribosomes in extracts of lymph node cells removed from hyperimmunized rabbits, if the ribonuclease activity in such extracts is inhibited. Prior treatment of the cells with actinomycin D markedly decreases protein synthesis by polyribosomes."

https://openalex.org/W2001407404,"A granulocytosis-promoting extract of mouse tumor tissue was partially purified by differential precipitation with cold 20- to 30-percent ethanol at pH 6.5, ""salting out"" with 50- to 75-percent saturated ammonium sulfate, and filtration through Sephadex G-75 dextran gel. In intact mice, single doses of the extract (at least 12 micrograms per gram of body weight) induced up to a 30-fold increase in circulating granulocytes and a two- to threefold decrease in circulating mononuclear cells within 3 to 7 hours of intravenous injection."
https://openalex.org/W2012541196,The electroretinogram of the newborn human shows the x-wave component which was demonstrated by Adrian and others to be a concomitant of photopic visual function in the adult. This finding may provide electrophysiological support for behavioral observations indicating that infants have some color vision and ability to resolve visual stimuli.

https://openalex.org/W2013724992,"Evoked potentials recorded at the cochlear nucleus of unanesthetized cats show that auditory habituation is a process with a rapid onset and a slower rate of dissipation, and that the habituation is a direct function of the rate of stimulation. Neither the middle ear muscles nor the reticular formation appear to participate in this process. It is suggested that auditory habituation might be a function of the interaction of the olivocochlear bundle and some intrinsic property of higher synaptic areas."

https://openalex.org/W2039254394,"5-Hydroxytryptamine, catecholamines, and histamine in mast cells can be distinguished by fluorescence microscopy. Microscopic spectrofluorometry can be used to estimate 5-hydroxytryptamine in single neoplastic mast cells grown in vitro, and to study the effect of reserpine on these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2010675447,"Some of the features revealed by the rotation technique of examining electron micrographs may be artifacts. To avoid misinterpretation, ""rotated"" photographs should be compared with originals. The criterion of reinforcement of structures in the ""rotated"" photographs is not enough, and it cannot be presumed that all the structures reinforced are actually present in the object under study. Further tests for radial symmetry in the arrangement of elements in a pattern should be made."
https://openalex.org/W2089379247,"THE cumulus oophorus of rabbit eggs can be dispersed in vitro by suspensions of rabbit spermatozoa1,2 or by hyaluronidase3, but the corona radiata remains intact4. Both the corona and the zona pellucida can be dissolved by proteolytic enzymes such as ficin, papain, ‘Pronase’ (a bacterial proteinase) and trypsin2,5, but the mechanism by which dissolution is brought about in vivo remains obscure6. However, it is known that when spermatozoa penetrate the layers of cumulus and corona cells of rabbit eggs the acrosomes become detached6, and it has been suggested that this leads to liberation of a ‘zona lysin’, a hypothetical enzyme which is localized between the sperm head and the acrosome7."
https://openalex.org/W2070091965,"Allotypic specificities were identified on two different myeloma proteins and the corresponding normal γG-immunoglobulins of BALB/c mice. When the sera of F2 progeny from a cross between BALB/c mice having the a1 allotype and AL mice having the a4 allotype were tested for these specificities, it was found that the two allotypic specificities of the BALB/c mice were either both present (87 mice) or both absent (36 mice), an indication of linkage in their genetic control."

Pyruvate kinase catalyses a key1,2, adenosine triphosphate-generating glycolytic reaction. We have examined the relationship between the activity of pyruvate kinase and the age of the normal human red cell."

In comparison to a typical alkylating agent, nitrogen mustard, or to urethan, uracil mustard (on a molar basis) was considerably more carcinogenic."

https://openalex.org/W1991179812,"In 65 chemical and pharmaceutical laboratories women comprised 22 percent of the professional personnel. The majority were in jobs requiring only B.S. degrees and in laboratories emphasizing long-range research. The overall turnover rate for women was much higher than for men, but within the upper grades the rate was only moderately higher, and within the lowest grade was no higher. Laboratory directors reported that turnover differentials did not inhibit the employment of women, provided they could be expected to remain for a certain minimum time."

Further work has shown a considerable difference in the specific activities of these substances obtained in a number of iodinations though the experimental conditions were kept as nearly identical as possible."

https://openalex.org/W2012949414,"SOME years ago I observed1 capillary movement in the hyphae of Mucor mucedo; the phenomenon was not photographed at the time and subsequent attempts to repeat the observation were unsuccessful. Recently, however, the observation has been repeated, in fungi cultivated on dishes of sugar-agar. Capillary movement was observed after the addition of a drop of guinea-pig blood to the culture medium, but it is uncertain whether the relation between the observation and the addition of blood was causal or merely fortuitous."
https://openalex.org/W2037107167,NUMEROUS techniques of tumour transplantation have been used since Hanau1 established the transplantability of animal tumours in 1889. One of us reported a technique using a curved surgical needle in 1963 (refs. 2 and 3).
