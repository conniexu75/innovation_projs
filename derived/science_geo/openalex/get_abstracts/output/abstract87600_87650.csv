https://openalex.org/W2075318315,"Comparisons of the relation between brain and body weights among extant mammals show that brain sizes have not increased as much as body sizes. Interspecific increases in brain and body size appear to occur at the same rate, however, when the amount of available energy is taken into account. After this adjustment, brains of primates are slightly larger than expected from the overall mammalian data, but primates also use a larger proportion of their total energy reserves for their brains. Analyses of relative brain size must take into account the requirements that the metabolically active brain has for the body."

(1979) Biochemistry 18, 3075-3078). We have synthesized and characterized 6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (Acrylodan) which selectively labels thiol moieties in proteins. The quantum yield of this agent is markedly enhanced after reaction with thiols, and as expected, the fluorescent derivatives are very sensitive to dipolar perturbation from their environments. The usefulness of Acrylodan in the study of hydrophobic domains, conformational changes, and dipolar relaxation processes in proteins is demonstrated by measurements of fluorescence spectra and lifetimes of a mercaptoethanol adduct dissolved in different solvents and of adducts of this agent with parvalbumin, troponin C, papain, and carbonic anhydrase."

This observation is of potential clinical significance because the long-term treatment of transplant patients with cyclosporin A, a widely used immunosuppressive agent, can give rise to B-cell lymphoma resulting from Epstein-Barr virus activation."
https://openalex.org/W1512266787,"The relative rates of transcription of epoxide hydratase, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase, and cytochrome P-450b genes were determined in purified hepatocyte nuclei isolated at different times after phenobarbital administration. The rates of transcription of the epoxide hydratase and oxidoreductase genes were increased 4- and 9-fold, respectively, above control levels 1 h after administration of the drug. Transcription rates for the oxidoreductase gene slowly decreased to control values at 24 h while transcription of the epoxide hydratase gene rapidly declined to approximately 2-fold above control values at 2.5 h and remained at this level up to 24 h after administration. Interestingly, transcription of the cytochrome P-450b gene followed a markedly different induction time course than the epoxide hydratase and oxidoreductase genes. Specifically, cytochrome P-450b gene transcription increased 23-fold above control values 6 to 8 h after phenobarbital administration and then slowly declined to 14-fold at 24 h. The increased levels of intranuclear pre-mRNA and cytoplasmic mRNA for each enzyme correlated well with transcriptional activity. In contrast to these results, the rate of transcription of the serum albumin gene was not affected, and levels of albumin mRNA actually decreased after administration of phenobarbital. The rapid increase in the rates of transcription and the appearance of elevated levels of nuclear pre-mRNAs and cytoplasmic mRNAs unequivocally demonstrates that phenobarbital elevates levels of these drug-metabolizing enzymes primarily by augmenting the rate of transcription of their respective genes."
https://openalex.org/W1545603006,"The synthesis of glycoproteins containing N-linked complex oligosaccharides is blocked by swainsonine at the step catalyzed by Golgi mannosidase II (Tulsiani, D. R. P., Harris, T. M., and Touster, O. (1982) J. Biol Chem. 257, 7936-7939). Accordingly, hybrid glycoproteins might be produced in the presence of swainsonine. In this report, we demonstrate that swainsonine causes human skin fibroblasts to synthesize such glycoproteins. In control fibroblasts, there were approximately equal amounts of complex and high mannose glycoproteins. In the presence of swainsonine (10 micrograms/ml), most of the complex glycoproteins were replaced by hybrid types. The principal oligosaccharide had the following structure: (formula; see text) A smaller amount of the asialo hybrid was also produced. The structure of the hybrid was established by Bio-Gel P-4 fractionation of oligosaccharides produced by endoglycosidase H treatment of pronase-derived glycopeptides, followed by examination of the susceptibility of the oligosaccharide to glycohydrolases and by its adsorbability to serotonin-Sepharose 4B. The same hybrid oligosaccharide was produced efficiently by rat liver Golgi membranes in the presence of ([3H] Man)5GlcNAc, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Gal, CMP-NeuAc, and swainsonine. Golgi mannosidase II had no action on the hybrid oligosaccharide, and little action on asialo hybrid, but both were converted to the mannosidase II substrate, GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc, by appropriate treatment with neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase. Jack bean alpha-D-mannosidase gave the expected yields of free mannose from the various oligosaccharides studied in this work. Swainsonine should be useful in investigating the role of oligosaccharide structure of glycoproteins because of its ability to alter the oligosaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1563210214,"In attempts to identify cell binding domains in the basement membrane protein laminin (Mr = 900,000), responsible for the substrate attachment mediating activity of the protein, proteolytic fragments were isolated and compared with respect to their biological activity. The fragments analyzed were generated by digestion of the protein with elastase or pepsin and included the previously described fragments 1 to 4 and three additional fragments, 5, 6, and 7 with molecular weights of 30,000 to 50,000. Fragments 1, 5, and 6 promoted substrate attachment of rat hepatocytes. Fragment 5, and to a lesser extent also fragment 6, but not fragment 1, induced spreading of the cells. Other fragments including the heparin-binding domain were inactive. Structural and immunological analyses indicated that fragment 1 is distinctly different from the other cell-binding fragments, whereas fragment 5 and 6 are similar but not identical. Furthermore, the active fragments were localized to different regions of the three short arms of the cross-shaped laminin molecule. Thus, the data suggest that fragments 1, 5, and 6 represent three separate domains with cell binding capacity. Attachment of hepatocytes to the fragments but not to intact laminin could be inhibited by specific antibodies indicating that the intact protein may contain an additional cell-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1528319719,"Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) incubated with 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-[3H]alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC; platelet activating factor) inactivated the compound by removing the acetyl group and replacing it with a long chain acyl residue. The nature of the acyl group added at the 2-position of the 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-GPC formed was examined by argentation chromatography and by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. A striking selectivity for arachidonate was observed in the acylation reaction. The major labeled component of the starting material was the 1-O-hexadecyl-linked species; high performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that 75 to 80% of this component was acylated by arachidonate. Similarly, based on argentation thin layer chromatography, approximately 80% of the total starting material was acylated by tetraenoic acyl residues. The incorporation of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-lyso-GPC into 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-GPC by the PMN was compared; no difference in the acylation pattern was observed with the 2-acetyl and 2-lyso precursors. Thus, activation of the PMN does not appear to be required to elicit the selectivity for arachidonate. When labeled 1-palmitoyl-2-lyso-GPC was compared in the system under the same conditions, it was also preferentially acylated by arachidonate; thus, it is not clear at this time whether or not the selectivity for arachidonate is physiologically limited to platelet activating factor. Our findings suggest a close relationship exists between the metabolism of platelet activating factor and arachidonate in human PMN."

The molecular nature of this polymorphism was studied by examining the structure of the coding portions of three alleles of the I-A beta chain gene, an immune response gene whose protein product constitutes a subunit of the I-A molecule. Comparison of the I-A beta chains encoded by these alleles revealed an amino acid sequence divergence of 5 to 8 percent. The differences were found to be a series of short alterations clustered in the amino terminal half of the polypeptide."

https://openalex.org/W2071235641,"Single-copy chorion genes coding for egg shell proteins are amplified in the follicle cells of Drosophila melanogaster egg chambers. Chromatin spreads of appropriately staged follicle cells reveal complex, multi-forked chromosomal structures in which one chromatin strand branches into two, which themselves branch out, and so on. In one micrograph, 13 strands originating from a single strand were observed. These structures can account for the maximal amplification occurring in the center of the domain, where the major chorion genes are located, and the decreasing amplification of flanking sequences to both sides. The amplification, high transcriptional rate, stage-specific expression, and correlation with known molecular sizes have allowed the putative identification of the single-copy, major chorion genes on the X chromosome and on chromosome III."

Thus the inhibitory effects of glucocorticosteroids on somatic growth which involve an interaction of these steroids and growth hormone at a peripheral level may also involve a modification of pathways within the central nervous system that regulate normal growth hormone secretion.

https://openalex.org/W1566167255,"When ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase from Synechococcus (strain RRIMP N1) was precipitated under mildly acidic conditions, most of its small subunits remained in solution. The precipitated enzyme readily redissolved at neutral pH and remained as an octamer of large subunits with some small subunits still attached. Optimum pH for this separation was 5.3 and disulfide-reducing reagents were not necessary. The fraction of small subunits removed by a single precipitation increased with increasing NaCl concentration. Catalytic activity of small subunit-depleted enzyme was linearly proportional to the fraction of small subunits remaining, while the carboxylase:oxygenase activity ratio and the affinity for CO2 remained constant. When isolated small subunits were added back to depleted enzyme preparations at neutral pH, reassociation occurred with return of catalytic activity. Under the usual assay conditions at pH 7.7, the binding constant of the small subunits was estimated to be about 10(-9) M. The small subunits also bound avidly to surfaces. However, loss of small subunits from the enzyme during the course of purification was minimal. The results are consistent with a simple model in which only those large subunits which have a small subunit bound to them are catalytically competent. Thus, an essential, even if indirect, role for the small subunits in catalysis is indicated."
https://openalex.org/W2060338237,"The human epidermoid carcinoma HEp3 exhibits highly malignant growth in chicken embryos that disappears progressively in cell culture. When studied by clonal analysis, loss of tumorigenicity was apparent within 20 generations and essentially complete after 40 generations in culture; affected all clones; and occurred under conditions which excluded the selection of variants based on superior growth rate in culture. Once ostensibly lost, the malignant phenotype reappeared after prolonged exposure of nontumorigenic cells to in vivo conditions. This similarly affected all clones assayed over a wide range of inoculum sizes. There was no evidence that HEp3 populations were heterogeneous with respect to tumorigenicity, or that the results were due to preferential selection of genetically determined subpopulations. It is suggested that the malignant phenotype of HEp3 is expressed in response to conditions in the physiological environment."

https://openalex.org/W1501958041,"The regulation of hepatic arginase (EC 3.5.3.1) activity was studied in diabetic rats fed ad libitum. Arginase activity in liver cytosol increased 2 to 3 days after injection of streptozotocin into rats and remained elevated (maximally 1.7-fold) 13 days postinjection. Radioimmunoassays indicated, however, that the amounts of immunoreactive arginase protein in livers of control and diabetic rats were similar. The specific activity of purified preparations of arginase from diabetic rats was approximately 1.5-fold higher than that from control rats. Manganese, a cofactor for arginase, was elevated by 4 days post-streptozotocin injection and remained elevated (maximally 1.6-fold) for at least 13 days. Most of the manganese in control and diabetic liver cytosols was associated with macromolecules and eluted with arginase activity upon gel filtration. These data establish that the enhanced arginase activity observed in diabetes is coincident with elevated cofactor concentration but not with elevated enzyme protein concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2092312510,"Faced with limited resources, the United States must set priorities for research to identify preventable causes of cancer. A quantitative approach to priority setting, based on principles of decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis, can offer guidance in this process. An illustrative application of such a model suggests that the National Institutes of Health-supported clinical trial of dietary beta-carotene offers a greater expected reduction in cancer mortality per research dollar than carcinogen bioassays of high-volume industrial chemicals such as p-dichlorobenzene. National research priorities should reflect the relative cost-effectiveness of such investments."
https://openalex.org/W1527932552,"Divalent cations inhibited in vitro release of growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) from bovine adenohypophysial secretory granules. Zinc, nickel, and cadmium were most potent, exerting 50% inhibition of protein release near 0.1 mM; relative potency was Ni2+ greater than or equal to Zn2+ greater than Cd2+ much greater than Mn2+ greater than Co2+ greater than Cu2+ much greater than Mg2+ greater than Ca2+. The pH optimum for inhibition, 8.0, was lower than that for stimulation of release by thiols. EDTA augmented release and reversed metal inhibition. Both immunoassay and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results indicated that metals inhibited both PRL and GH release in a dose-related fashion, and that PRL was more sensitive to all cations tested. With zinc present, known stimulators of release (reduced glutathione, ATP, and bicarbonate) restored GH release, but only ATP restored PRL release. Bicarbonate potently stimulated GH release, but only affected PRL when Mg2+ and ATP were present. We suggest that divalent cations influence GH and PRL release in a reversible fashion and at multiple sites. Some loci may be common to both lactotrope and somatotrope granules; however, the different sensitivities to metals and differential reversal by stimulators of release indicate that metal-protein interactions may also be specific for either granule, or for the hormones themselves."
https://openalex.org/W2091964451,Hybridization between two chromosomally distinct subspecies of the grasshopper Caledia captiva results in a high incidence of novel chromosomal rearrangements among the backcross progeny. Rearrangements are restricted to those chromosomes derived from the F1 hybrid parent. Chromosomal involvement is nonrandom with the same rearrangement occurring repeatedly in different backcrosses. A single individual can also generate an array of different rearrangements among its offspring. Several of the rearrangements have also been found in natural populations. The nonrandom and recurrent nature of these chromosomal mutations at high frequencies provides a plausible explanation for the establishment and fixation of chromosomal rearrangements in natural populations.

Using a biochemical fractionation method for the isolation of large hnRNA-containing structures (hnRNP) of Drosophila tissue culture cells, we show that seven of these antibodies recognize different antigens, and that these antigens are associated with RNA. Analysis of the sedimentation behavior of antigen-containing structures in sucrose gradients reveals that the antigens are differentially distributed with respect both to one another and to pulse-labeled RNA. We demonstrate that the antigens are minor components of hnRNP and are different from the major Drosophila hnRNP packaging proteins, which we have also identified. The antigens are probably involved in the processing of hnRNA in the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W1597591131,"Incubation of phenobarbital-induced rat liver microsomes with 2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (TCB) yielded about 30% of the substrate as 3-hydroxy-TCB, 3,4-dihydroxy-TCB, 3,3'-dihydroxy-TCB (tentative identification), and 3,4-dihydro-3,4-dihydroxy-TCB in relative amounts of about 1:1:0.05:0.05. Under identical conditions, 2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl 3,4-oxide (TCBO) yielded about 45% of the substrate as the above products in an approximate ratio of 0.1:1:0.01:1, as well as 10% as TCB. Omission of NADPH from incubations of TCBO decreased the yields of 3-hydroxy-TCB, both dihydroxy-TCBs, and TCB by 75-100%, increased the yield of 3,4-dihydro-3,4-dihydroxy-TCB 4-fold, and permitted the recovery of small amounts (0.5% yield) of 4-hydroxy-TCB. 3-Hydroxy-TCB and 4-hydroxy-TCB were both extensively metabolized to 3,4-dihydroxy-TCB; 3-hydroxy-TCB was also metabolized to the presumed 3,3'-dihydroxy-TCB. The metabolism of TCBO to 3,4-dihydro-3,4-dihydroxy-TCB was inhibited by 1,1,1-trichloropropene 2,3-oxide. These data indicate that the majority (greater than 90%) of the primary oxidation of TCB occurred via 3-hydroxylation mechanisms not involving TCBO and that only a small fraction occurred via 3,4-epoxidation. The formation of 3-hydroxy-TCB and TCBO from TCB via different pathways was consistent with the observation that TCB-treated rats excreted 6-fold higher levels of 3-hydroxy-TCB in their feces than did TCBO-treated rats."

This fraction has been separated into two components both of which have been highly purified. One component is methanopterin, and for the other component the name CDR factor is retained. No known coenzymes tested substitute in the methane-producing assay for CDR factor and methanopterin, both of which are stable to boiling and exposure to air. The ultraviolet-visible spectrum of CDR factor has a peak at 273 nm, a shoulder at 280 nm, and at pH 1, a peak at 219 nm. The ultraviolet-visible spectrum of methanopterin isolated from the CDR fraction is similar to the spectrum previously reported for this compound (Keltjens, J. T., and Vogels, G. D. (1981) in Microbial Growth on C1 Compounds (Dalton, H., ed) pp. 152-158, Heyden and Son, Ltd., London).

https://openalex.org/W1517887309,"Synthesis of citrulline from ornithine, NH4+, and HCO3- by isolated pig liver mitochondria is inhibited by acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, at the same concentrations which inhibit the mitochondrial matrix carbonic anhydrase. At an acetazolamide concentration sufficient to give complete inhibition of matrix carbonic anhydrase, the rate of citrulline synthesis is reduced by 71%, but no further decrease in citrulline is observed at higher concentrations of acetazolamide. Stimulation of O2 uptake by ornithine under conditions of maximal citrulline synthesis is also inhibited by acetazolamide. At pH 6.7, the ratio of citrulline synthesis is depressed relative to the rates observed over the range 7.2-7.7, and acetazolamide inhibits this rate by only 20%. These results support the hypothesis that the physiological role of carbonic anhydrase in liver mitochondria is to supply HCO3- as the substrate for the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, which provides the intermediate carbamoylphosphate in the rate-limiting step of citrulline synthesis. Since the uncatalyzed rate of CO2 hydration is rapid enough that it should not be rate-limiting for the carbamoylphosphate synthetase reaction, carbonic anhydrase appears to regulate access of HCO3- in the synthetase and so should be considered as one of the enzymes participating in the biosynthetic pathway leading to urea formation in the hepatocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2027978812,Depletion of polyamines in 9L rat brain tumor cells by treatment with alpha-difluoromethylornithine dramatically altered DNA conformation as measured by viscoelastometry. The reduction of intracellular putrescine and spermidine concentrations to less than 5 percent of their concentrations in control cells decreased the sensitivity of 9L cell DNA to x-irradiation and increased the maximum viscoelastic retardation time of the DNA. Both of these phenomena were reversed by addition of exogenous putrescine.
https://openalex.org/W1491451112,"Variant S49 mouse lymphoma cells with increased ornithine decarboxylase activity were obtained by selecting for resistance to alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a specific inhibitor of the enzyme. Ornithine decarboxylase was identified as a specifically immunoprecipitable polypeptide that was made at an increased rate in the variant cells. Ornithine decarboxylase was also identified on a two-dimensional gel as a metabolically labeled polypeptide of Mr approximately 55,000 which was synthesized at an increased rate in two independently selected variants. Synthesis of this polypeptide was further augmented by treatment of cells with inhibitors of ornithine decarboxylase activity. The charge of the polypeptide was altered by treatment of either cells or cellular extracts with DFMO, a suicide substrate which binds covalently to the enzyme. This charge alteration and the inactivation of ornithine decarboxylase showed the same dependence on DFMO concentration and both effects were prevented by addition of either ornithine or putrescine. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the half-life of the ornithine decarboxylase polypeptide in these variant cells was 45 min. We conclude that ornithine decarboxylase is made at an increased rate in the resistant variants and that the polypeptide turns over rapidly."

Rotational diffusion of cytochrome P-450 was measured by detecting the decay of absorption anisotropy r(t), after photolysis of the heme X CO complex by a vertically polarized laser flash. All cytochrome P-450 was found to be rotationally mobile when co-reconstituted with equimolar amounts of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase in lipid to cytochrome P-450 ((L/P450)) = 1 (w/w] vesicles. Antibodies against NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase were raised. Their specificity was demonstrated by Ouchterlony double diffusion analysis. Antireductase Fab fragments were prepared from antireductase IgG by papain digestion. The N-demethylation of benzphetamine, catalyzed by the proteoliposomes, was significantly inhibited by antireductase IgG and by antireductase Fab fragments. Cross-linking of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase by antireductase IgG resulted in complete immobilization of cytochrome P-450 in L/P450 = 1 vesicles. Antireductase IgG also immobilized cytochrome P-450 in L/P450 = 5 vesicles, although the degree of immobilization was slightly smaller. No immobilization of cytochrome P-450 in L/P450 = 1 vesicles was detected in the presence of antireductase Fab fragments or preimmune IgG. These results further support the proposal of the formation of monomolecular complexes between cytochrome P-450 and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase in liposomal membranes (Gut, J., Richter, C., Cherry, R.J., Winterhalter, K.H., and Kawato, S.

A ternary core subassembly, containing complexes A, B, and C, was isolated from a limited tryptic digest of AN112 phycobilisomes and characterized with respect to composition and spectroscopic properties. Isolation of this ternary subassembly also establishes that subcomplex D must occupy a terminal position in each of the two core cylinders. Spectroscopic studies of the individual complexes, A-D, of the subassemblies AB and ABC, and of intact AN112 phycobilisomes showed core assembly-dependent changes in the circular dichroism spectra indicative of changes in the environment and/or conformation of the bilin chromophores within the individual subcomplexes. Two terminal energy acceptors are present in the phycobilisome core, alpha APB and 75K. No indication of interaction between the chromophores on these polypeptides was detected by circular dichroism spectroscopy. This result indicates that the bilins on alpha APB and 75K act as independent energy acceptors rather than as exciton pairs."
https://openalex.org/W1566717683,"The effect of lipids singly and in combination on the ability of galactosyltransferase to transfer galactose to N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-forming lactosamine and to glucose forming lactose has been studied. Lecithins, as egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), or saturated as dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine stimulated the activity of the enzyme to form lactosamine to different extents. Egg PC produced the greatest stimulation of all the lecithins tested. Egg phosphatidic acid (PA) inhibited the activity of the enzyme at very low concentrations of lipid. In mixed vesicles of gel phase or liquid crystalline phase lecithins and egg PA, the acidic lipid was able to overcome the stimulation produced by the lecithins. The dominant effect of the head group was demonstrated by the effects of gel phase dimyristoylphosphatidic acid (DMPA). In mixtures with PC, DMPA also was able to inhibit the enzyme for lactosamine synthesis but higher concentrations of the gel phase DMPA were required for inhibition compared to the liquid crystalline PA. Although the head group appeared to dominate the inhibition, the nature of the acyl chains of the lipid played a secondary role at least. Other acid lipids, phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) were much less effective than PA. PS alone inhibited the activity of the enzyme. However, in mixed lipids (PS and egg PC), PS was unable to reverse the stimulation produced by PC while PC was able to reverse the inhibition produced by PS. PI alone had no effect on the enzyme activity. In mixtures with egg PC, the stimulating effect of PC was dominant. In the lactose synthetase reaction, the effect of lipids was similar to that of the lactosamine synthetase, i.e. PC stimulated and PA inhibited activity and in mixtures of PC and PA, the inhibitory effect of PA was dominant."

https://openalex.org/W1648076034,"We have measured the pH dependence of the kinetics of CO2 hydration catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase III from the skeletal muscle of the cat. Two methods were used: an initial velocity study in which the change in absorbance of a pH indicator was measured in a stopped flow spectrophotometer, and an equilibrium study in which the rate of exchange of 18O between CO2 and H2O was measured with a mass spectrometer. We have found that the steady state constants kCO2 cat and KCO2 m are independent of pH within experimental error in the range of pH 5.0 to 8.5; the rate of release from the enzyme of the oxygen abstracted from substrate HCO-3 in the dehydration is also independent of pH in this range. This behavior is very different from that observed for carbonic anhydrase II for which kCO2 cat and the rate of release of substrate oxygen are very pH-dependent. The rate of interconversion of CO2 and HCO-3 at equilibrium catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase III is not altered when the solvent is changed from H2O to 98% D2O and 2% H2O. Thus, the interconversion probably proceeds without proton transfer in its rate-limiting steps, similar to isozymes I and II."
https://openalex.org/W2026652192,"The recent attempt to show that the Hadar australopithecine female ‘Lucy’ (AL 288-1) had hindlimbs too short to allow a modern pattern of striding bipedal gait1 has important implications for understanding the origin of bipedalism, if not for the more general problem of hominid origins. Combined with previous claims that Lucy had a forelimb unusually long in proportion2 and ape-like in morphology3, the additional contention of a relatively short hindlimb would suggest a very different pattern of gait from the norm of today because the effectiveness of the pendulum action of the lower limb during stride is a function of the amount of mass in the limb4, and because a short hindlimb would necessitate a short stride length1. Yet, these contentions seem contradicted by the analyses of Lucy's pelvis (and the innomminates of other australopithecines)4,5 that indicate a similar pattern of muscle use and imply a lack of significant gait differences. Are Lucy's legs too short to allow an effective stride, or is there a different solution to this contra diction? I propose here that there is."

To determine the effects of the loss of this enzyme on cell growth and metabolism, we selected two methylthioadenosine phosphorylase-deficient mutant clones of the transplantable murine T lymphoma cell line R1.1. The first had 3.5% of wild type methylthioadenosine phosphorylase activity. The second was completely enzyme-deficient. The loss of the enzyme did not alter the growth rate, cloning efficiency, or tumor-forming ability of the T lymphoma cells. The methylthioadenosine phosphorylase-deficient clones excreted substantial amounts of methylthioadenosine into the culture medium (0.13 and 0.32 nmol/h/mg of protein, respectively) and were unable to utilize the methylthioadenosine phosphorylase substrate 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine as a purine source when de novo purine synthesis was blocked. Spermine levels were 10-20% lower in the enzyme-deficient clones than in wild type cells. The loss of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase rendered the mutants exquisitely sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of methylthioadenosine. Methylthioadenosine at 3-6 microM inhibited their growth by 50%. The toxic effects of methylthioadenosine were not attributable to inhibition of purine, pyrimidine, or polyamine synthesis."

That this cell polarity depends on the presence of tight junctions can be demonstrated by labelling one surface of a cell monolayer in culture with fluorescent lectins and lipid probes, and subsequently observing whether the labels disperse to the opposite cell surfaces4,5. Here we report on a differential distribution of binding sites for the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) on the cells of Drosophila melanogaster larval fat body, and show that the pattern is correlated with the structural association between the cell surfaces and their overlying basement membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1590981529,"Our previous in vivo studies demonstrated that large premature fragments of beta-galactosidase are degraded in Escherichia coli by a common pathway, and the initial event appears to be a site-specific cleavage (McKnight, J. L., and Fried, V. A. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 9652-9661). We now have developed a cell-free system that retains the specificity of this early cleavage event. Immunochemical techniques were used to isolate and quantitate the polypeptide substrate and products in pulse-chase experiments. The in vitro system has an activity that quantitatively converts the prematurely terminated A polypeptide of the lacZ non-sense mutant CSH-10 to the 90-kilodalton common B polypeptide intermediate observed in vivo. The activity is localized in the cytoplasm since the cleavage reaction is not affected by osmotic shock of whole cells or removal of the membrane fraction from cell-free extracts. The lon mutation capR9, which blocks this degradation pathway in vivo, does not affect the initial cleavage event in cell-free extracts of CSH-10 carrying this mutation. The in vitro cleavage event in extracts of lon+ CSH-10 or the isogenic lon- mutant is not stimulated by addition of ATP, not inhibited by depletion of ATP pools by hexokinase-2-deoxyglucose treatment, and not inhibited by EDTA or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. These results suggest that the ATP-dependent proteolytic activity of the lon gene product does not directly catalyze this primary cleavage event."
https://openalex.org/W1576003552,"Calcium efflux from sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles that have been equilibrated with 1-100 mM CaCl2 in the absence of ATP has two apparently first order components. The initial calcium content of each component increases with the total Ca content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which reaches 5, 24, and 80 nmol/mg of protein after equilibration with 1, 10, and 100 mM CaCl2, respectively. Initial rates of Ca efflux into a medium containing 10 mM EGTA increase in proportion to Ca in the loading medium up to 20 mM. Above 20 mM, efflux from the slow component clearly saturates, whereas efflux from the fast component continues to increase. The rate constant for the smaller, faster component to efflux (k congruent to 0.5 min-1) is not affected by changing the concentration of Ca either inside or outside the vesicles. The rate constant of the larger, slower component (k congruent to 0.05 min-1) is also unaffected by changes in internal Ca concentration. However, external [Ca2+] diminishes the rate constant of the slow component 6-10-fold. Inhibition by external [Ca2+] is characterized by cooperative interaction between two sites with an apparent Kd of 5.3 X 10(-6) M. The two components may represent two populations of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles that differ 10-fold in passive permeability to Ca when external [Ca2+] is less than 10(-6) M, and 60-100-fold when external [Ca2+] is greater than 10(-5) M. The passive permeability in one of these populations seems to be regulated by external, high affinity Ca binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1642717910,"The beta-glucuronidase activity of Drosophila melanogaster exists as two chromatographically separable forms, both of which are glycoproteins. Form I is membrane-bound in vivo, has a pI of 8.0-8.5, and can be irreversibly inactivated either by incubation at 55 degrees C for 20 min or by incubation at 37 degrees C in the presence of 6 M urea. Form II exists both membrane-bound as well as membrane-free, has a pI of 4.5, and is resistant to the conditions which inactivate form I. The two forms are similar in Km and Vmax for the artificial substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide and both forms are precipitated by antibody to form II. A natural genetic variant, beta-GluL1, completely lacks from I beta-glucuronidase. This variant behaves in a co-dominant fashion for the determination of the presence of form I and has been localized to the extreme distal portion of chromosome 3R. Other data indicate that at least one genetic determinant for the amount of form II is also localized to this portion of chromosome 3R."

https://openalex.org/W1504017762,"The surface charge of isolated apolipoprotein A-I, apo-A-II, apo-C-II, and apo-C-III2 as well as of liposomes from synthetic highly purified phospholipids and isolated very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles from different donors (n = 35) was determined by titration. The particle size of apolipoproteins was evaluated from their molecular weight and specific volume, while that of VLDL particles was determined by photon correlation spectroscopy. The surface charge density of apolipoproteins and of VLDL at pH 7 was calculated from the number of surface charges of the particle and the surface area. The experimental net charge versus pH curves for apo-A-I and apo-A-II are very similar to the theoretical data. The differences between experimental and calculated results for apo-C-II and apo-C-III2 are believed to result from polyelectrolyte effects of neighboring charged centers within the protein molecule causing a decrease of dissociation of carboxylic residues. Neutral phospholipid liposomes do not exhibit anionic or cationic properties between pH 3 and 9. Liposomes from anionic phospholipids behave similar to polymeric carboxylic acids, i.e. their degree of dissociation increases with pH. The number of surface charges of VLDL particles increases with the particle size, while their surface charge density is about 1.10 +/- 0.36 charges/nm2 of the surface area."
https://openalex.org/W1587257141,"Antibodies directed to modified nucleosides recognize the nucleoside (antigen) when it is present in an intact tRNA molecule. The general application of anti-nucleoside immunoadsorbent chromatography, however, has been greatly impeded by the apparent inefficiency and low capacity of conventional immunoadsorbents for transfer RNA. Antibodies specific for isopentenyladenosine (i6A) were employed to investigate the efficacy of various immunoadsorbents with respect to immobilization of antibody protein and with respect to their ability to bind i6A-containing tRNAs. Biologically active anti-i6A was recovered in high yield (80-88%) by affinity chromatography on i6A-adipate-Sepharose 4B or i6A-butane diglycidyl ether-Sepharose 4B using either 15% pyridine in phosphate-buffered saline or 0.2 M acetic acid as eluents. The binding capacity of various anti-i6A antibody immunoadsorbents was evaluated. While both anti-i6A antibody-protein A-agarose-iminothiolane (ITL) and anti-i6A antibody-protein A-agarose-dimethyl suberimidate showed a high capacity for i6A-tRNA, the latter column is much less efficient with respect to antibody immobilization. Under optimal conditions, the ITL immunoadsorbent binds 5-6 nmol of i6A/mg of antibody protein. With respect to bulk tRNA, 1 mg of antibody protein (ITL immunoadsorbent) binds all of the i6A-tRNA in a 1-mg sample."
