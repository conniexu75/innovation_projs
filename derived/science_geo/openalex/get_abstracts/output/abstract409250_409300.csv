https://openalex.org/W2157355956,"Bacteria, fungi, protozoa, chromista and plants all harbor homologues of Hsp104, a AAA+ ATPase that collaborates with Hsp70 and Hsp40 to promote protein disaggregation and reactivation. Curiously, however, metazoa do not possess an Hsp104 homologue. Thus, whether animal cells renature large protein aggregates has long remained unclear. Here, it is established that mammalian cytosol prepared from different sources possesses a potent, ATP-dependent protein disaggregase and reactivation activity, which can be accelerated and stimulated by Hsp104. This activity did not require the AAA+ ATPase, p97. Rather, mammalian Hsp110 (Apg-2), Hsp70 (Hsc70 or Hsp70) and Hsp40 (Hdj1) were necessary and sufficient to slowly dissolve large disordered aggregates and recover natively folded protein. This slow disaggregase activity was conserved to yeast Hsp110 (Sse1), Hsp70 (Ssa1) and Hsp40 (Sis1 or Ydj1). Hsp110 must engage substrate, engage Hsp70, promote nucleotide exchange on Hsp70, and hydrolyze ATP to promote disaggregation of disordered aggregates. Similarly, Hsp70 must engage substrate and Hsp110, and hydrolyze ATP for protein disaggregation. Hsp40 must harbor a functional J domain to promote protein disaggregation, but the J domain alone is insufficient. Optimal disaggregase activity is achieved when the Hsp40 can stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp110 and Hsp70. Finally, Hsp110, Hsp70 and Hsp40 fail to rapidly remodel amyloid forms of the yeast prion protein, Sup35, or the Parkinson's disease protein, alpha-synuclein. However, Hsp110, Hsp70 and Hsp40 enhanced the activity of Hsp104 against these amyloid substrates. Taken together, these findings suggest that Hsp110 fulfils a subset of Hsp104 activities in mammals. Moreover, they suggest that Hsp104 can collaborate with the mammalian disaggregase machinery to rapidly remodel amyloid conformers."

To enable seamless transition from highly multiplexed biomarker discovery assays to a format suitable and convenient for diagnostic and life-science applications, we developed a streamlined, plate-based version of the assay. The plate-based version of the assay is robust, sensitive (sub-picomolar), rapid, can be highly multiplexed (upwards of 60 analytes), and fully automated. We demonstrate that quantification by microarray-based hybridization, Luminex bead-based methods, and qPCR are each compatible with our platform, further expanding the breadth of proteomic applications for a wide user community."
https://openalex.org/W2079860184,"GPR55 is activated by l-α-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) but also by certain cannabinoids. In this study, we investigated the GPR55 pharmacology of various cannabinoids, including analogues of the CB1 receptor antagonist Rimonabant®, CB2 receptor agonists, and Cannabis sativa constituents. To test ERK1/2 phosphorylation, a primary downstream signaling pathway that conveys LPI-induced activation of GPR55, a high throughput system, was established using the AlphaScreen® SureFire® assay. Here, we show that CB1 receptor antagonists can act both as agonists alone and as inhibitors of LPI signaling under the same assay conditions. This study clarifies the controversy surrounding the GPR55-mediated actions of SR141716A; some reports indicate the compound to be an agonist and some report antagonism. In contrast, we report that the CB2 ligand GW405833 behaves as a partial agonist of GPR55 alone and enhances LPI signaling. GPR55 has been implicated in pain transmission, and thus our results suggest that this receptor may be responsible for some of the antinociceptive actions of certain CB2 receptor ligands. The phytocannabinoids Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarin, cannabidivarin, and cannabigerovarin are also potent inhibitors of LPI. These Cannabis sativa constituents may represent novel therapeutics targeting GPR55."
https://openalex.org/W2079248963,"IL-17A is a proinflammatory cytokine that is produced by specialized T helper cells and contributes to the development of several autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Transcription factor cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM)α displays increased expression levels in T cells from SLE patients and has been described to account for aberrant T cell function in SLE pathogenesis. In this report, we provide evidence that CREMα physically binds to a cAMP-responsive element, CRE (-111/-104), within the proximal human IL17A promoter and increases its activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays reveal that activated naïve CD4(+) T cells as well as T cells from SLE patients display increased CREMα binding to this site compared with T cells from healthy controls. The histone H3 modification pattern at the CRE site (-111/-104) and neighboring conserved noncoding sequences within the human IL17A gene locus suggests an accessible chromatin structure (H3K27 hypomethylation/H3K18 hyperacetylation) in activated naïve CD4(+) T cells and SLE T cells. H3K27 hypomethylation is accompanied by decreased cytosine phosphate guanosine (CpG)-DNA methylation in these regions in SLE T cells. Decreased recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)3a to the CRE site (-111/-104) probably accounts for the observed epigenetic alterations. Reporter studies confirmed that DNA methylation of the IL17A promoter indeed abrogates its inducibility. Our findings demonstrate an extended role for CREMα in the immunopathogenesis of SLE because it contributes to increased expression of IL-17A."
https://openalex.org/W2122446275,"Knockout mice deficient in the gap junction gene connexin43 exhibit developmental anomalies associated with abnormal neural crest, primordial germ cell, and proepicardial cell migration. These migration defects are due to a loss of directional cell movement, and are associated with abnormal actin stress fiber organization and a loss of polarized cell morphology. To elucidate the mechanism by which Cx43 regulates cell polarity, we used a wound closure assays with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to examine polarized cell morphology and directional cell movement. Studies using embryonic fibroblasts from Cx43 knockout (Cx43KO) mice showed Cx43 deficiency caused cell polarity defects as characterized by a failure of the Golgi apparatus and the microtubule organizing center to reorient with the direction of wound closure. Actin stress fibers at the wound edge also failed to appropriately align, and stabilized microtubule (Glu-tubulin) levels were markedly reduced. Forced expression of Cx43 with deletion of its tubulin-binding domain (Cx43dT) in both wildtype MEFs and neural crest cell explants recapitulated the cell migration defects seen in Cx43KO cells. However, forced expression of Cx43 with point mutation causing gap junction channel closure had no effect on cell motility. TIRF imaging revealed increased microtubule instability in Cx43KO cells, and microtubule targeting of membrane localized Cx43 was reduced with expression of Cx43dT construct in wildtype cells. Together, these findings suggest the essential role of Cx43 gap junctions in development is mediated by regulation of the tubulin cytoskeleton and cell polarity by Cx43 via a nonchannel function."
https://openalex.org/W2071485896,"Itraconazole is a safe and widely used antifungal drug that was recently found to possess potent antiangiogenic activity. Currently, there are four active clinical trials evaluating itraconazole as a cancer therapeutic. Tumor growth is dependent on angiogenesis, which is driven by the secretion of growth factors from the tumor itself. We report here that itraconazole significantly inhibited the binding of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and that both VEGFR2 and an immediate downstream substrate, phospholipase C γ1, failed to become activated after VEGF stimulation. These effects were due to a defect in VEGFR2 trafficking, leading to a decrease in cell surface expression, and were associated with the accumulation of immature N-glycans on VEGFR2. Small molecule inducers of lysosomal cholesterol accumulation and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition, two previously reported itraconazole activities, failed to recapitulate itraconazole's effects on VEGFR2 glycosylation and signaling. Likewise, glycosylation inhibitors did not alter cholesterol trafficking or inhibit mTOR. Repletion of cellular cholesterol levels, which was known to rescue the effects of itraconazole on mTOR and cholesterol trafficking, was also able to restore VEGFR2 glycosylation and signaling. This suggests that the new effects of itraconazole occur in parallel to those previously reported but are downstream of a common target. We also demonstrated that itraconazole globally reduced poly-N-acetyllactosamine and tetra-antennary complex N-glycans in endothelial cells and induced hypoglycosylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor in a renal cell carcinoma line, suggesting that itraconazole's effects extend beyond VEGFR2.

https://openalex.org/W2043277567,"Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), with their very large and complex N termini, are thought to participate in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and appear to be highly relevant in several developmental processes. Their intracellular signaling is still poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that GPR133, a member of the adhesion GPCR subfamily, activates the G(s) protein/adenylyl cyclase pathway. The presence of the N terminus and the cleavage at the GPCR proteolysis site are not required for G protein signaling. G(s) protein coupling was verified by Gα(s) knockdown with siRNA, overexpression of Gα(s), co-expression of the chimeric Gq(s4) protein that routes GPR133 activity to the phospholipase C/inositol phosphate pathway, and missense mutation within the transmembrane domain that abolished receptor activity without changing cell surface expression. It is likely that not only GPR133 but also other adhesion GPCR signal via classical receptor/G protein-interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2167178110,"The availability of fully sequenced bacterial genomes has revealed that many species known to synthesize the polyamine spermidine lack the spermidine biosynthetic enzymes S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and spermidine synthase. We found that such species possess orthologues of the sym-norspermidine biosynthetic enzymes carboxynorspermidine dehydrogenase and carboxynorspermidine decarboxylase. By deleting these genes in the food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni, we found that the carboxynorspermidine decarboxylase orthologue is responsible for synthesizing spermidine and not sym-norspermidine in vivo. In polyamine auxotrophic gene deletion strains of C. jejuni, growth is highly compromised but can be restored by exogenous sym-homospermidine and to a lesser extent by sym-norspermidine. The alternative spermidine biosynthetic pathway is present in many bacterial phyla and is the dominant spermidine route in the human gut, stomach, and oral microbiomes, and it appears to have supplanted the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase/spermidine synthase pathway in the gut microbiota. Approximately half of the gut Firmicutes species appear to be polyamine auxotrophs, but all encode the potABCD spermidine/putrescine transporter. Orthologues encoding carboxyspermidine dehydrogenase and carboxyspermidine decarboxylase are found clustered with an array of diverse putrescine biosynthetic genes in different bacterial genomes, consistent with a role in spermidine, rather than sym-norspermidine biosynthesis. Due to the pervasiveness of ε-proteobacteria in deep sea hydrothermal vents and to the ubiquity of the alternative spermidine biosynthetic pathway in that phylum, the carboxyspermidine route is also dominant in deep sea hydrothermal vents. The carboxyspermidine pathway for polyamine biosynthesis is found in diverse human pathogens, and this alternative spermidine biosynthetic route presents an attractive target for developing novel antimicrobial compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2122753551,"The protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) family member anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) is reportedly overexpressed in numerous cancers and plays a role in cancer development. However, to date the molecular functions of AGR2 remain to be characterized. Herein we have identified AGR2 as bound to newly synthesized cargo proteins using a proteomics analysis of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-bound ribosomes. Nascent protein chains that translocate into the ER associate with specific ER luminal proteins, which in turn ensures proper folding and posttranslational modifications. Using both imaging and biochemical approaches, we confirmed that AGR2 localizes to the lumen of the ER and indirectly associates with ER membrane-bound ribosomes through nascent protein chains. We showed that AGR2 expression is controlled by the unfolded protein response and is in turn is involved in the maintenance of ER homeostasis. Remarkably, we have demonstrated that siRNA-mediated knockdown of AGR2 significantly alters the expression of components of the ER-associated degradation machinery and reduces the ability of cells to cope with acute ER stress, properties that might be relevant to the role of AGR2 in cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W1977691538,"The cellular prion protein (PrPC) undergoes constitutive proteolytic cleavage between residues 111/112 to yield a soluble N-terminal fragment (N1) and a membrane-anchored C-terminal fragment (C1). The C1 fragment represents the major proteolytic fragment of PrPC in brain and several cell types. To explore the role of C1 in prion disease, we generated Tg(C1) transgenic mice expressing this fragment (PrP(Δ23-111)) in the presence and absence of endogenous PrP. In contrast to several other N-terminally deleted forms of PrP, the C1 fragment does not cause a spontaneous neurological disease in the absence of endogenous PrP. Tg(C1) mice inoculated with scrapie prions remain healthy and do not accumulate protease-resistant PrP, demonstrating that C1 is not a substrate for conversion to PrPSc (the disease-associated isoform). Interestingly, Tg(C1) mice co-expressing C1 along with wild-type PrP (either endogenous or encoded by a second transgene) become ill after scrapie inoculation, but with a dramatically delayed time course compared with mice lacking C1. In addition, accumulation of PrPSc was markedly slowed in these animals. Similar effects were produced by a shorter C-terminal fragment of PrP(Δ23-134). These results demonstrate that C1 acts as dominant-negative inhibitor of PrPSc formation and accumulation of neurotoxic forms of PrP. Thus, C1, a naturally occurring fragment of PrPC, might play a modulatory role during the course of prion diseases. In addition, enhancing production of C1, or exogenously administering this fragment, represents a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of prion diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2064407050,"For optimal proteolytic function, the central core of the proteasome (core particle (CP) or 20S) has to associate with activators. We investigated the impact of the yeast activator Blm10 on proteasomal peptide and protein degradation. We found enhanced degradation of peptide substrates in the presence of Blm10 and demonstrated that Blm10 has the capacity to accelerate proteasomal turnover of the unstructured protein tau-441 in vitro. Mechanistically, proteasome activation requires the opening of a closed gate, which allows passage of unfolded proteins into the catalytic chamber. Our data indicate that gate opening by Blm10 is achieved via engagement of its C-terminal segment with the CP. Crucial for this activity is a conserved C-terminal YYX motif, with the penultimate tyrosine playing a preeminent role. Thus, Blm10 utilizes a gate opening strategy analogous to the proteasomal ATPases HbYX-dependent mechanism. Because gating incompetent Blm10 C-terminal point mutants confers a loss of function phenotype, we propose that the cellular function of Blm10 is based on CP association and activation to promote the degradation of proteasome substrates.

https://openalex.org/W1965607887,"This study focused on the effects of short-term microgravity (22 s) on the gene expression and morphology of endothelial cells (ECs) and evaluated gravisensitive signaling elements. ECs were investigated during four German Space Agency (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt) parabolic flight campaigns. Hoechst 33342 and acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining showed no signs of cell death in ECs after 31 parabolas (P31). Gene array analysis revealed 320 significantly regulated genes after the first parabola (P1) and P31. COL4A5, COL8A1, ITGA6, ITGA10, and ITGB3 mRNAs were down-regulated after P1. EDN1 and TNFRSF12A mRNAs were up-regulated. ADAM19, CARD8, CD40, GSN, PRKCA (all down-regulated after P1), and PRKAA1 (AMPKα1) mRNAs (up-regulated) provide a very early protective mechanism of cell survival induced by 22 s microgravity. The ABL2 gene was significantly up-regulated after P1 and P31, TUBB was slightly induced, but ACTA2 and VIM mRNAs were not changed. β-Tubulin immunofluorescence revealed a cytoplasmic rearrangement. Vibration had no effect. Hypergravity reduced CARD8, NOS3, VASH1, SERPINH1 (all P1), CAV2, ADAM19, TNFRSF12A, CD40, and ITGA6 (P31) mRNAs. These data suggest that microgravity alters the gene expression patterns and the cytoskeleton of ECs very early. Several gravisensitive signaling elements, such as AMPKα1 and integrins, are involved in the reaction of ECs to altered gravity.—Grosse, J., Wehland, M., Pietsch, J., Ma, X., Ulbrich, C., Schulz, H., Saar, K., Hübner, N., Hauslage, J., Hemmersbach, R., Braun, M., van Loon, J., Vagt, N., Infanger, M., Eilles, C., Egli, M., Richter, P., Baltz, T., Einspanier, R., Sharbati, S., Grimm, D.

https://openalex.org/W1981420400,"Pre-eclampsia is a complication of pregnancy associated with activation of coagulation. It is caused by the placenta, which sheds increased amounts of syncytiotrophoblast microvesicles (STBM) into the maternal circulation. We hypothesized that STBM could contribute to the haemostatic activation observed in pre-eclampsia.STBM were collected by perfusion of the maternal side of placentae from healthy pregnant women and women with pre-eclampsia at caesarean section. Calibrated automated thrombography was used to assess thrombin generation triggered by STBM-borne tissue factor in platelet poor plasma (PPP). No thrombin was detected in PPP alone but the addition of STBM initiated thrombin generation in 14/16 cases. Pre-eclampsia STBM significantly shortened the lag time (LagT, P = 0.01) and time to peak thrombin generation (TTP, P = 0.005) when compared to normal STBM. Blockade of tissue factor eliminated thrombin generation, while inhibition of tissue factor pathway inhibitor significantly shortened LagT (p = 0.01) and TTP (P<0.0001), with a concomitant increase in endogenous thrombin potential.STBM triggered thrombin generation in normal plasma in a tissue factor dependent manner, indicating that TF activity is expressed by STBM. This is more pronounced in STBM shed from pre-eclampsia placentae. As more STBM are shed in pre-eclampsia these observations give insight into the disordered haemostasis observed in this condition."
https://openalex.org/W2038841613,"PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) has emerged as a novel therapeutic target for hypercholesterolemia due to its LDL receptor (LDLR)-reducing activity. Although its structure has been solved, the lack of a detailed understanding of the structure-function relation hinders efforts to develop small molecule inhibitors. In this study, we used mutagenesis and transfection approaches to investigate the roles of the prodomain (PD) and the C-terminal domain (CD) and its modules (CM1-3) in the secretion and function of PCSK9. Deletion of PD residues 31-40, 41-50, or 51-60 did not affect the self-cleavage, secretion, or LDLR-degrading activity of PCSK9, whereas deletion of residues 61-70 abolished all of these functions. Deletion of the entire CD protein did not impair PCSK9 self-cleavage or secretion but completely abolished LDLR-degrading activity. Deletion of any one or two of the CD modules did not affect self-cleavage but influenced secretion and LDLR-reducing activity. Furthermore, in cotransfection experiments, a secretion-defective PD deletion mutant (ΔPD) was efficiently secreted in the presence of CD deletion mutants. This was due to the transfer of PD from the cotransfected CD mutants to the ΔPD mutant. Finally, we found that a discrete CD protein fragment competed with full-length PCSK9 for binding to LDLR in vitro and attenuated PCSK9-mediated hypercholesterolemia in mice. These results show a previously unrecognized domain interaction as a critical determinant in PCSK9 secretion and function. This knowledge should fuel efforts to develop novel approaches to PCSK9 inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1996933707,"The α6-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) have recently been implicated in diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), including Parkinson's disease and substance abuse. In contrast, little is known about the role of α6* nAChRs in the peripheral nervous system (where the asterisk denotes the possible presence of additional subunits). Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons are known to express nAChRs with a pharmacology consistent with an α7, α3β4*, and α4β2* composition. Here we present evidence that DRG neurons also express α6* nAChRs. We used RT-PCR to show the presence of α6 subunit transcripts and patch-clamp electrophysiology together with subtype-selective α-conotoxins to pharmacologically characterize the nAChRs in rat DRG neurons. α-Conotoxin BuIA (500 nM) blocked acetylcholine-gated currents (I(ACh)) by 90.3 ± 3.0%; the recovery from blockade was very slow, indicating a predominance of α(x)β4* nAChRs. Perfusion with either 300 nM BuIA[T5A;P6O] or 200 nM MII[E11A], α-conotoxins that target the α6β4* subtype, blocked I(ACh) by 49.3 ± 5 and 46.7 ± 8%, respectively. In these neurons, I(ACh) was relatively insensitive to 200 nM ArIB[V11L;V16D] (9.4±2.0% blockade) or 500 nM PnIA (23.0±4% blockade), α-conotoxins that target α7 and α3β2*/α6β2* nAChRs, respectively. We conclude that α6β4* nAChRs are among the subtypes expressed by DRG, and to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of α6β4* in neurons outside the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2038854973,"Microtubules are structural components of the cytoskeleton that determine cell shape, polarity, and motility in cooperation with the actin filaments. In order to determine the role of microtubules in cell alignment, human airway smooth muscle cells were exposed to cyclic uniaxial stretch. Human airway smooth muscle cells, cultured on type I collagen-coated elastic silicone membranes, were stretched uniaxially (20% in strain, 30 cycles/min) for 2 h. The population of airway smooth muscle cells which were originally oriented randomly aligned near perpendicular to the stretch axis in a time-dependent manner. However, when the cells treated with microtubule disruptors, nocodazole and colchicine, were subjected to the same cyclic uniaxial stretch, the cells failed to align. Lack of alignment was also observed for airway smooth muscle cells treated with a microtubule stabilizer, paclitaxel. To understand the intracellular mechanisms involved, we developed a computational model in which microtubule polymerization and attachment to focal adhesions were regulated by the preexisting tensile stress, pre-stress, on actin stress fibers. We demonstrate that microtubules play a central role in cell re-orientation when cells experience cyclic uniaxial stretching. Our findings further suggest that cell alignment and cytoskeletal reorganization in response to cyclic stretch results from the ability of the microtubule-stress fiber assembly to maintain a homeostatic strain on the stress fiber at focal adhesions. The mechanism of stretch-induced alignment we uncovered is likely involved in various airway functions as well as in the pathophysiology of airway remodeling in asthma."
https://openalex.org/W1976132554,"The ability to fully restore damaged or lost organs is present in only a subset of animals. The Xenopus tadpole tail is a complex appendage, containing epidermis, muscle, nerves, spinal cord, and vasculature, which regenerates after amputation. Understanding the mechanisms of tail regeneration may lead to new insights to promote biomedical regeneration in non-regenerative tissues. Although chromatin remodeling is known to be critical for stem cell pluripotency, its role in complex organ regeneration in vivo remains largely uncharacterized. Here we show that histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity is required for the early stages of tail regeneration. HDAC1 is expressed during the 1st two days of regeneration. Pharmacological blockade of HDACs using Trichostatin A (TSA) increased histone acetylation levels in the amputated tail. Furthermore, treatment with TSA or another HDAC inhibitor, valproic acid, specifically inhibited regeneration. Over-expression of wild-type Mad3, a transcriptional repressor known to associate in a complex with HDACs via Sin3, inhibited regeneration. Similarly, expression of a Mad3 mutant lacking the Sin3-interacting domain that is required for HDAC binding also blocks regeneration, suggesting that HDAC and Mad3 may act together to regulate regeneration. Inhibition of HDAC function resulted in aberrant expression of Notch1 and BMP2, two genes known to be required for tail regeneration. Our results identify a novel early role for HDAC in appendage regeneration and suggest that modulation of histone acetylation is important in regenerative repair of complex appendages."

We show that the cells from patients, carrying mutations or rare variants, have variable levels of increased intracellular pro-IL-1β indicating that normal NLRP7 down-regulates pro-IL-1β synthesis in response to LPS.

https://openalex.org/W1675635816,"Protein scaffolds maintain precision in kinase signaling by coordinating kinases with components of specific signaling pathways. Such spatial segregation is particularly important in allowing specificity of signaling mediated by the 10-member family of protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes. Here we identified a novel interaction between PKCα and the Discs large homolog (DLG) family of scaffolds that is mediated by a class I C-terminal PDZ (PSD-95, disheveled, and ZO1) ligand unique to this PKC isozyme. Specifically, use of a proteomic array containing 96 purified PDZ domains identified the third PDZ domains of DLG1/SAP97 and DLG4/PSD95 as interaction partners for the PDZ binding motif of PKCα. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments verified that PKCα and DLG1 interact in cells by a mechanism dependent on an intact PDZ ligand. Functional assays revealed that the interaction of PKCα with DLG1 promotes wound healing; scratch assays using cells depleted of PKCα and/or DLG1 have impaired cellular migration that is no longer sensitive to PKC inhibition, and the ability of exogenous PKCα to rescue cellular migration is dependent on the presence of its PDZ ligand. Furthermore, we identified Thr-656 as a novel phosphorylation site in the SH3-Hook region of DLG1 that acts as a marker for PKCα activity at this scaffold. Increased phosphorylation of Thr-656 is correlated with increased invasiveness in non-small cell lung cancer lines from the NCI-60, consistent with this phosphorylation site serving as a marker of PKCα-mediated invasion.

The concentration of leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, IL-1β, ghrelin, C-reactive protein (CRP), cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and the in vitro immune response (lymphoproliferation and IFN-γ production) was evaluated in 53 patients with active untreated tuberculosis, 27 household contacts and 25 healthy controls, without significant age- or sex-related differences. Patients had a lower body mass index (BMI), reduced levels of leptin and DHEA, and increased concentrations of CRP, IL-6, cortisol, IL-1β and nearly significant adiponectin values than household contacts and controls. Within tuberculosis patients the BMI and leptin levels were positively correlated and decreased with increasing disease severity, whereas higher concentrations of IL-6, CRP, IL-1β, cortisol, and ghrelin were seen in cases with moderate to severe tuberculosis. Household contacts had lower DHEA and higher IL-6 levels than controls. Group classification by means of discriminant analysis and the k-nearest neighbor method showed that tuberculosis patients were clearly different from the other groups, having higher levels of CRP and lower DHEA concentration and BMI. Furthermore, plasma leptin levels were positively associated with the basal in vitro IFN-γ production and the ConA-driven proliferation of cells from tuberculosis patients. Present alterations in the communication between the neuro-endocrine and immune systems in tuberculosis may contribute to disease worsening."
https://openalex.org/W2082035143,"The infection consequences of the introduced cestode fish parasite Bothriocephalus acheilognathi were studied in a cohort of wild, young-of-the-year common carp Cyprinus carpio that lacked co-evolution with the parasite. Within the cohort, parasite prevalence was 42% and parasite burdens were up to 12% body weight. Pathological changes within the intestinal tract of parasitized carp included distension of the gut wall, epithelial compression and degeneration, pressure necrosis and varied inflammatory changes. These were most pronounced in regions containing the largest proportion of mature proglottids. Although the body lengths of parasitized and non-parasitized fish were not significantly different, parasitized fish were of lower body condition and reduced weight compared to non-parasitized conspecifics. Stable isotope analysis (δ15N and δ13C) revealed trophic impacts associated with infection, particularly for δ15N where values for parasitized fish were significantly reduced as their parasite burden increased. In a controlled aquarium environment where the fish were fed ad libitum on an identical food source, there was no significant difference in values of δ15N and δ13C between parasitized and non-parasitized fish. The growth consequences remained, however, with parasitized fish growing significantly slower than non-parasitized fish, with their feeding rate (items s−1) also significantly lower. Thus, infection by an introduced parasite had multiple pathological, ecological and trophic impacts on a host with no experience of the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2090272171,"The secretion of Wnt signaling proteins is dependent upon the transmembrane sorting receptor, Wntless (Wls), which recycles between the trans-Golgi network and the cell surface. Loss of Wls results in impairment of Wnt secretion and defects in development and homeostasis in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and the mouse. The sorting signals for the internalization and trafficking of Wls have not been defined. Here, we demonstrate that Wls internalization requires clathrin and dynamin I, components of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. Moreover, we have identified a conserved YXXϕ endocytosis motif in the third intracellular loop of the multipass membrane protein Wls. Mutation of the tyrosine-based motif YEGL to AEGL (Y425A) resulted in the accumulation of human mutant Wls on the cell surface of transfected HeLa cells. The cell surface accumulation of Wls(AEGL) was rescued by the insertion of a classical YXXϕ motif in the cytoplasmic tail. Significantly, a Drosophila Wls(AEGL) mutant displayed a wing notch phenotype, with reduced Wnt secretion and signaling. These findings demonstrate that YXXϕ endocytosis motifs can occur in the intracellular loops of multipass membrane proteins and, moreover, provide direct evidence that the trafficking of Wls is required for efficient secretion of Wnt signaling proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2066401705,"Drosophila melanogaster and its close relatives have been extremely important model species in the development of population genetic models that serve to explain patterns of diversity in natural populations, a major goal of evolutionary biology. A detailed picture of the evolutionary history of these species is beginning to emerge, as the relative importance of forces including demographic changes and natural selection is established. A continuing aim is to characterise levels of genetic diversity in a large number of populations of these species, covering a wide geographic area. We have used collections from five previously un-sampled wild populations of D. melanogaster and two of D. simulans, across three continents. We estimated levels of genetic diversity within, and divergence between, these populations, and looked for evidence of genetic structure both between ancestral and derived populations, and amongst derived populations. We also investigated the prevalence of infection with the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia. We found that D. melanogaster populations from Sub-Saharan Africa are the most diverse, and that divergence is highest between these and non-Sub-Saharan populations. There is strong evidence for structuring of populations between Sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world, and some evidence for weak structure amongst derived populations. Populations from Sub-Saharan Africa also differ in the prevalence of Wolbachia infection, with very low levels of infection compared to populations from the rest of the world."
https://openalex.org/W2032914675,"Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) is an incretin hormone secreted in response to food intake. The best known function of GIP is to enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. Extra-pancreatic effects of GIP primarily occur in adipose tissues. Here, we demonstrate that GIP increases insulin-dependent translocation of the Glut4 glucose transporter to the plasma membrane and exclusion of FoxO1 transcription factor from the nucleus in adipocytes, establishing that GIP has a general effect on insulin action in adipocytes. Stimulation of adipocytes with GIP alone has no effect on these processes. Using pharmacologic and molecular genetic approaches, we show that the effect of GIP on adipocyte insulin sensitivity requires activation of both the cAMP/protein kinase A/CREB signaling module and p110β phosphoinositol-3' kinase, establishing a novel signal transduction pathway modulating insulin action in adipocytes. This insulin-sensitizing effect is specific for GIP because isoproterenol, which elevates adipocyte cAMP and activates PKA/CREB signaling, does not affect adipocyte insulin sensitivity. The insulin-sensitizing activity points to a more central role for GIP in intestinal regulation of peripheral tissue metabolism, an emerging feature of inter-organ communication in the control of metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1968809860,"Galectin-9 expression in endothelial cells can be induced in response to inflammation. However, the mechanism of its expression remains unclear. In this study, we found that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) induced galectin-9 expression in human endothelial cells in a time-dependent manner, which coincided with the activation of histone deacetylase (HDAC). When endothelial cells were treated with the HDAC3 inhibitor, apicidin, or shRNA-HDAC3 knockdown, IFN-γ-induced galectin-9 expression was abolished. Overexpression of HDAC3 induced the interaction between phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and IFN response factor 3 (IRF3), leading to IRF3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and galectin-9 expression. HDAC3 functioned as a scaffold protein for PI3K/IRF3 interaction. In addition to galectin-9 expression, IFN-γ also induced galectin-9 location onto plasma membrane, which was HDAC3-independent. Importantly, HDAC3 was essential for the constitutive transcription of PI3K and IRF3, which might be responsible for the basal level of galectin-9 expression. The phosphorylation of IRF3 was essential for galectin-9 expression. This study provides new evidence that HDAC3 regulates galectin-9 expression in endothelial cells via interaction with PI3K-IRF3 signal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2033214516,"Diterpenes show diverse chemical structures and various physiological roles. The diversity of diterpene is primarily established by diterpene cyclases that catalyze a cyclization reaction to form the carbon skeleton of cyclic diterpene. Diterpene cyclases are divided into two types, monofunctional and bifunctional cyclases. Bifunctional diterpene cyclases (BDTCs) are involved in hormone and defense compound biosyntheses in bryophytes and gymnosperms, respectively. The BDTCs catalyze the successive two-step type-B (protonation-initiated cyclization) and type-A (ionization-initiated cyclization) reactions of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP). We found that the genome of a lycophyte, Selaginella moellendorffii, contains six BDTC genes with the majority being uncharacterized. The cDNA from S. moellendorffii encoding a BDTC-like enzyme, miltiradiene synthase (SmMDS), was cloned. The recombinant SmMDS converted GGDP to a diterpene hydrocarbon product with a molecular mass of 272 Da. Mutation in the type-B active motif of SmMDS abolished the cyclase activity, whereas (+)-copalyl diphosphate, the reaction intermediate from the conversion of GGDP to the hydrocarbon product, rescued the cyclase activity of the mutant to form a diterpene hydrocarbon. Another mutant lacking type-A activity accumulated copalyl diphosphate as the reaction intermediate. When the diterpene hydrocarbon was enzymatically synthesized from [U-13C6]mevalonate, all carbons were labeled with 13C stable isotope (>99%). The fully 13C-labeled product was subjected to 13C-13C COSY NMR spectroscopic analyses. The direct carbon-carbon connectivities observed in the multidimensional NMR spectra demonstrated that the hydrocarbon product by SmMDS is miltiradiene, a putative biosynthetic precursor of tanshinone identified from the Chinese medicinal herb Salvia miltiorrhiza. Hence, SmMDS functions as a bifunctional miltiradiene synthase in S. moellendorffii. In this study, we demonstrate that one-dimensional and multidimensional 13C NMR analyses of completely 13C-labeled compound are powerful methods for biosynthetic studies.

Terpenoids are the largest class of natural products and function as primary and secondary metabolites including hormones, cell constituents, fragrances, and medicinal substances. Terpene cyclases are one of the committed enzymes in terpenoid biosynthesis that are involved in formation of carbon skeletons. In plants, several diterpene cyclases play crucial roles in hormone synthesis (1MacMillan J. Beale M.H. Comprehensive Natural Product Chemistry. Elsevier Science Ltd., Oxford1999: 217-243Google Scholar) and induce the production of defense compounds against pathogens (2Trapp S. Croteau R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 689-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Cyclic diterpenes are derived from geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP 2The abbreviations used are: GGDPgeranylgeranyl diphosphateADSabietadiene synthaseBDTCbifunctional diterpene cyclaseCDPcopalyl diphosphateCPSent-copalyl diphosphate synthaseKSent-kaurene synthaseMDSmiltiradiene synthaseHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceINADEQUATEincredible natural abundance double quantum transfer experimentsRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsrSmMDSrecombinant ΔN98SmMDS fused with a His6 tag.; C20) through specific cyclases localized in plastids. Among them, the structure and function of ent-kaurene synthases are well characterized. ent-Kaurene is a tetracyclic hydrocarbon that is a biosynthetic intermediate phytohormone of gibberellins. It is formed from GGDP via ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CDP) by combination of the monofunctional ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS) and ent-kaurene synthase (KS) in flowering plants (3Toyomasu T. Sassa T. Comprehensive Natural Product II Chemistry and Biology. Elsevier, Oxford2010: 643-672Google Scholar). By comparison, these steps are catalyzed by a single peptide bifunctional CPS/KS in moss (Physcomitrella patens) and liverwort (Jungermannia subulata) (4Hayashi K. Kawaide H. Notomi M. Sakigi Y. Matsuo A. Nozaki H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6175-6181Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Kawaide H. Hayashi K. Kawanabe R. Sakigi Y. Matsuo A. Natsume M. Nozaki H. FEBS J. 2011; 278: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These non-vascular land plants have only a bifunctional ent-kaurene synthase. Fungal ent-kaurene synthases are also bifunctional, although their amino acid sequences are not significantly similar to the plant bifunctional CPS/KS (6Kawaide H. Imai R. Sassa T. Kamiya Y. J. Biol.

Conversion from GGDP into ent-CDP is initiated by protonation of a C=C double bond in the GGDP (type-B cyclization), and synthesis of ent-kaurene from ent-CDP is initiated by carbocation formation caused by release of a diphosphate group (type-A cyclization) (1MacMillan J. Beale M.H. Comprehensive Natural Product Chemistry. Elsevier Science Ltd., Oxford1999: 217-243Google Scholar). The type-B and type-A cyclizations require an aspartate-rich DXDD motif near the N terminus and a DDXXD motif near the C terminus, respectively. The monofunctional CPS and KS have the DXDD and DDXXD motifs, respectively, whereas the bifunctional CPS/KS from moss, liverwort, and fungi has both motifs (4Hayashi K. Kawaide H. Notomi M. Sakigi Y. Matsuo A. Nozaki H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6175-6181Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Kawaide H. Hayashi K. Kawanabe R. Sakigi Y. Matsuo A. Natsume M. Nozaki H.

These characteristics are common among bifunctional diterpene cyclases (BDTCs) involved in labdane-related diterpene biosyntheses (3Toyomasu T. Sassa T. Comprehensive Natural Product II Chemistry and Biology. Elsevier, Oxford2010: 643-672Google Scholar). For instance, the two motifs are also conserved in bifunctional abietadiene-related cyclases (9Vogel B.S. Wildung M.R. Vogel G. Croteau R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23262-23268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The abietadiene and its related hydrocarbons are converted from GGDP via (+)-CDP and are responsible for the biosynthesis of resin acids in gymnosperms (10Martin D.M. Fäldt J. Bohlmann J. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1908-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Notably, recent x-ray studies of the two monofunctional diterpene cyclases taxadiene synthase (type-A cyclase) and Arabidopsis CPS (type-B cyclase) revealed that they consist of three α-helical domains (α, β, and γ) (11Köksal M. Jin Y. Coates R.M. Croteau R. Christianson D.W. Nature. 2011; 469: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 12Köksal M. Hu H. Coates R.M. Peters R.J. Christianson D.W. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 431-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The overall structure of taxadiene synthase and CPS are significantly similar, although the cyclization process they catalyze is quite different. Additionally, the mutation of a single amino acid in type-A cyclase affects the cyclization steps to change the product profile (5Kawaide H. Hayashi K. Kawanabe R. Sakigi Y. Matsuo A. Natsume M. Nozaki H. FEBS J. 2011; 278: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Wilderman P.R. Peters R.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 15736-15737Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, it would be difficult to predict the structures of the cyclized products from GGDP on the basis of cyclase sequence information. The functional analysis of an unidentified diterpene cyclase is a challenging task due to the numerous varieties of terpenoid structures, particularly if the phytochemical constituents are not known from the target plant species. For confirmation of the identification of a novel compound, comparison with an authentic sample is desirable. However, the mass spectra of diterpene hydrocarbons are so similar that structural determination of compounds using this means is difficult. Spectroscopic analysis such as NMR gives crucial information about structures, although it requires a relatively large amount of sample for precise analysis. Diterpene hydrocarbons often have quaternary carbon atoms, which prevent proton detection by NMR analyses. Although INADEQUATE, a type of homonuclear 13C-13C NMR spectroscopy, can directly determine carbon-carbon connectivities, this method suffers from poor sensitivity and the low natural abundance of the 13C isotope (1.1%) (14Claridge T.D.W. High-Resolution NMR Techniques in Organic Chemistry. 2nd Ed. Elsevier, Oxford2009: 189-232Google Scholar). To overcome the faults, we established a full 13C labeling technique by using a one-pot terpenoid synthesis system (enzyme mixture) containing recombinant enzymes responsible for terpenoid biosyntheses. In our previous work, fully 13C-labeled gibberellins were synthesized from [U-13C6]mevalonate via ent-kaurene. In that report, one-dimensional NMR analysis of fully 13C-labeled ent-kaurene showed high sensitivity and carbon-carbon coupling (15Sugai Y. Miyazaki S. Mukai S. Yumoto I. Natsume M. Kawaide H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2011; 75: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). If such a fully 13C-labeled compound is analyzed by homonuclear multidimensional 13C NMR experiments, these spectra showing carbon-carbon connectivities would allow unambiguous determination of the chemical structures of various terpenoids with high sensitivity. The lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii is a model organism that has great interest as a plant system with a unique evolutionary placement. The complete genome of S. moellendorffii was sequenced, and almost all the genes were recently annotated (16Banks J.A. Nishiyama T. Hasebe M. Bowman J.L. Gribskov M. dePamphilis C. Albert V.A.

A homology search using a genomic database suggested that S. moellendorffii has at least 13 genes encoding labdane-related monofunctional diterpene cyclases or BDTCs (16Banks J.A. Nishiyama T.

The gymnosperms also have monofunctional diterpene cyclases for gibberellin biosynthesis and BDTCs for resin acid biosynthesis. However, resin acids and defense-related diterpenes have not been isolated and identified from ferns and lycophytes. The homologs of monofunctional CPS and KS in S. moellendorffii should be responsible for ent-kaurene synthesis leading to gibberellins (18Hirano K. Nakajima M. Asano K. Nishiyama T. Sakakibara H. Kojima M. Katoh E. Xiang H. Tanahashi T. Hasebe M. Banks J.A. Ashikari M. Kitano H. Ueguchi-Tanaka M. Matsuoka M. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 3058-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about the function and physiological roles of BDTCs in S. moellendorffii. In this study, we adapted enzymatic total synthesis, 13C labeling, and multidimensional NMR techniques for the functional analysis of a BDTC of S. moellendorffii. Notably, we successfully synthesized a uniformly 13C-labeled product by a BDTC homolog (SmMDS) in S. moellendorffii in vitro and performed multidimensional NMR experiments to elucidate the structure of the product, miltiradiene. Miltiradiene was first isolated from a Chinese medicinal plant, Salvia miltiorrhiza, and was presumed to be an intermediate of tanshinone, a pharmaceutical secondary metabolite (19Gao W. Hillwig M.L. Huang L. Cui G. Wang X. Kong J. Yang B. Peters R.J. Org. Lett. 2009; 11: 5170-5173Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). S. moellendorffii was from the Tsukuba Botanical Garden of the National Museum of Nature and Science. [U-13C6]Mevalonate was prepared by fermentation of Saccharomycopsis fibuligera. Recombinant enzymes for the labeled GGDP production were produced in Escherichia coli and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. An enzyme mixture for GGDP synthesis was prepared by the methods described previously (15Sugai Y. Miyazaki S. Mukai S. Yumoto I. Natsume M. Kawaide H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2011; 75: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from the aerial part of S. moellendorffii (300 mg wet weight) by using an RNeasy® plant minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The poly(A)+ RNA was purified, and the cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase with oligo(dT)18 primers (GE Healthcare) as described in a previous report (4Hayashi K. Kawaide H. Notomi M. Sakigi Y. Matsuo A. Nozaki H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6175-6181Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A gene-specific primer set (sense, 5′-TGCTCGTCGCGGAAGTGAAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CAGCCGCTCAATGGTGTCG-3′) was used for amplification of the target cDNA fragment by PCR. The temperatures for annealing and extension were 65 °C (30 s) and 72 °C (2.7 min), respectively. The 5′- and 3′-end sequences of the cDNA were determined using a GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. PCR for the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and 3′-RACE was performed using gene-specific primers as follows: 5′-AACGTCGTGGGAGCGGAATGG-3′ (antisense primer for primary PCR), 5′-TGTTGTGCCCGATGTCCCAGGTCTTG-3′ (antisense primer for secondary PCR in 5′-RACE), 5′-CAAGACCTGGGACATCGGGCACA-3′ (sense primer for primary PCR), and 5′-AAATCCATTCCGCTCCCACGAC-3′ (sense primer for secondary PCR in 3′-RACE). The open reading frame cDNA encoding SmMDS lacking the predicted transit peptide sequence (Δ98) was amplified by PCR (Phusion Hi-Fi DNA polymerase, Finnzyme, Vantaa, Finland) using the following primer set: Δ98 sense primer 5′-AATGAGAGAAACCTCGCTGCTC-3′ (ATG for the start codon is underlined) and SmMDS antisense primer 5′-TCACAAAGTTCTATAAGTTTCTAAACAAAAC-3′. The amplified cDNA fragment was treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Toyobo, Shiga, Japan) and successively introduced into the SmaI site in the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen). This construct (pQE-SmMDS) was used for transformation of E. coli JM109. The transformant was incubated in 800 ml of 2× YT medium (1.6% tryptone, 1.0% yeast extract, and 1.0% NaCl adjusted pH 7.5 with NaOH) containing 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin at 37 °C. When the A600 value reached 0.6, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added, and the cells were incubated at 18 °C for 24 h. The recombinant SmMDS protein was extracted from the cells as described previously (15Sugai Y. Miyazaki S. Mukai S. Yumoto I. Natsume M. Kawaide H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2011; 75: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen). The two aspartate residues, Asp611 and Asp612 in the 611DDLMD motif and Asp391 and Asp392 in the 389DIDD motif, were substituted by glycine to abolish the type-A cyclase activity and type-B activity of SmMDS, respectively. According to the procedures described previously (5Kawaide H. Hayashi K. Kawanabe R. Sakigi Y. Matsuo A. Natsume M. Nozaki H. FEBS J. 2011; 278: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), both mutations, D611G/D612G and D391G/D392G, were introduced by PCR using the following mutation primers: D611G/D612G sense primer 5′-CACTTTATTTGGTGGTCTTATGGACTGTGC-3′ and D611G/D612G antisense primer 5′-GCACAGTCCATAAGACCACCAAATAAAGTG-3′ and D391G/D392G sense primer 5′-CAATGACATAGGCGGCACAGCAATGGC-3′ and D391G/D392G antisense primer 5′-GCCATTGCTGTGCCGCCTATGTCATTG-3′ (mutated nucleotides are underlined), respectively. Each SmMDS mutant cDNA was introduced in the pQE30 vector and used for preparation of the recombinant enzymes as described above. The recombinant SmMDS protein (24 μg) was used for reaction with GGDP in the presence of 5 mm magnesium ion. After 1.5-h incubation at 28 °C, the product was extracted with cyclohexane and analyzed by GC-MS. For synthesis of the fully 13C-labeled product, SmMDS protein was mixed with GGDP synthetic enzyme mixture (15Sugai Y. Miyazaki S. Mukai S. Yumoto I. Natsume M. Kawaide H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2011; 75: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The mixture contained six enzymes (1.3 mg of mevalonate kinase, 1.3 mg of phosphomevalonate kinase, 1.3 mg of diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase, 1.3 mg of isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, 3.2 mg of GGDP synthase, and 11.5 mg of SmMDS), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and 7.5 mg of [U-13C6]mevalonate as the substrate in 32 ml of reaction buffer. After the enzyme reaction at 28 °C for 12 h, the product was extracted three times with cyclohexane and concentrated under a gentle stream of dry N2 gas. To purify the enzyme product, the extract was loaded onto a column packed with silica gel (Bond Elut SI, 500 mg/3 ml; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and eluted with cyclohexane. The flow-through fraction was further purified by HPLC (Silver Column KANTO (5-μm particle, 4.6-mm inner diameter × 250 mm; Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan)) using cyclohexane as the mobile phase at 1 ml min−1 (column temperature, 40 °C). The 13C-labeled and non-labeled hydrocarbon products were analyzed by GC-MS and 13C NMR. GC-MS spectral data were measured with JMS-Bu25 (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The capillary column DB-5 (0.25-mm inner diameter × 15 m, 0.25-μm film thickness; J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) was used with GC-MS conditions as described previously (15Sugai Y. Miyazaki S. Mukai S. Yumoto I. Natsume M. Kawaide H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2011; 75: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The NMR analysis was performed at the NMR facility at RIKEN Yokohama Institute. The NMR sample was dissolved in cyclohexane-d12 (99%) and aliquoted into the NMR tube (Shigemi microsample tube, 5-mm inner diameter; Shigemi, Tokyo, Japan). The solvent signals were used as the reference. NMR spectra were obtained at 300 K and a 1H reference frequency of 700 MHz on an Avance III spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). To clarify the resonances derived from quaternary carbon atoms, we acquired the one-dimensional 13C spectrum with an isotope-filtered module to purge the 1H-attached 13C resonances (20Breeze A.L. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2000; 36: 323-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments were recorded with a total of 1,024 and 256 complex points in the F2 and F1 dimensions, respectively. To discriminate the multiplicity of the attached proton and carbon atoms, edited HSQC and constant time HSQC as well as HSQC were measured for the SmMDS product (21Willker W. Leibfritz D.

Two-dimensional homonuclear correlation spectroscopy (13C-13C COSY) experiments were recorded using the pulse sequence reported previously in the literature (23Nagayama K. Kumar A. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1980; 40: 321-334Google Scholar) that describes the pulse data with spectral widths of 22,935.779 Hz (F2) and 22,884.779 Hz (F1) and with complex data points of 2,048 (F2) and 512 (F1). The three-dimensional HCCH COSY experiment was recorded by using the pulse scheme according to a report by Bax et al. (24Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 88: 425-431Google Scholar). The spectral width was 10,504.202 Hz along the 1H (F3) dimension, 10,561.783 Hz along the 13C (F2) dimension, and 10,500.499 Hz along the 1H (F1) dimension. The number of complex data points was 1,024 (1H) × 64 (13C) × 128 (1H). The (H)CCH COSY was recorded using the pulse sequence reported previously (25Gehring K. Ekiel I. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 135: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, the CCH COSY experiments, which start with the evolution of the 13C magnetization, were performed by the modification of the (H)CCH COSY pulse sequence. The spectral widths were 10,504.202 Hz along the 1H (F3) dimension, 7,041.189 Hz along the 13C (F2) dimension, and 7,041.189 Hz along the 13C (F1) dimension. The number of complex data points were 1,024 (1H) × 128 (13C) × 128 (13C). All NMR data were processed using the programs TOPSPIN 3.0 (Bruker) and NMRpipe. Analyses of the processed data were performed using programs TOPSPIN 3.0 and NMRView (26Johnson B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar) with KUJIRA (27Kobayashi N. Iwahara J.

A homology search suggested that S. moellendorffii has six putative BDTC genes possessing both DXDD and DDXXD motifs in their deduced amino acid sequences. Among them, we cloned an expressed cDNA encoding a putative BDTC from the aerial part by RT-PCR and named it SmMDS. The full-length sequence of the 2743-bp cDNA was determined by 5′- and 3′-RACE. Its open reading frame is 2604 bp encoding 867 amino acids (DDBJ accession number AB668998). This deduced amino acid sequence has a putative transit peptide sequence at the N terminus and diterpene-specific motifs such as SAYDTAW, DIDD, and DDLMD. This sequence showed high homology with not only the abietadiene synthase from Abies grandis (AgADS) and the levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase from Norway spruce (<45% identities; Refs. 9Vogel B.S.

The recombinant ΔN98SmMDS fused with a His6 tag (rSmMDS) was used for the conversion assay using GGDP as a substrate. After incubation, GC-MS analysis showed that rSmMDS afforded a single product peak at 6.73 min on a mass chromatogram, and its mass spectrum is shown in Fig. 1A and Fig. 2C with major peaks of m/z (relative intensity) 272 (M+, 79%), 257 (33%), 229 (14%), 148 (56%), 134 (100%), and 105 (60%).FIGURE 2Determination of intermediate during cyclization reaction of SmMDS from GGDP to hydrocarbon product. The intermediate from the GGDP cyclization reaction was determined by functional analysis of SmMDS and the site-directed mutant proteins. A, AtCPS is a type-B cyclase containing a DIDD motif that catalyzes the cyclization reaction of GGDP to ent-CDP. The product of ent-CDP was determined by GC-MS in its dephosphorylated form, ent-copalol. The retention time was 8.00 min after injection. B, the mutant protein of SmMDS, D611G/D612G, lacked type-A activity because the DDLMD motif in SmMDS was modified. This mutant accumulated a possible intermediate at 8.00 min after injection at the same retention time as ent-copalol. C, recombinant SmMDS wild type produced diterpene hydrocarbon as the final product. D, the mutant protein D391G/D392G produced no diterpene product from GGDP because it lacked type-B activity due to the modification of the DIDD motif. Co-incubation of the D391G/D392G mutant and (+)-CDP produced the same diterpene product as that of SmMDS wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To elucidate the structure by 13C NMR experiments, the uniformly 13C-labeled rSmMDS product was enzymatically synthesized using an enzyme mixture. The synthesis for the 13C-labeled rSmMDS product was performed by addition of rSmMDS protein into a [13C]GGDP synthetic mixture containing six recombinant enzymes and fully 13C-labeled mevalonate (13C > 99%; 7.5 mg) in 32-ml final volume. After incubation, the labeled product was extracted with cyclohexane. The extract was purified using silica gel column chromatography to remove unreacted precursors. Subsequently, the 13C-product was isolated by HPLC using an Ag+ column to give a pure product (HPLC tR = 16.75 min). The GC-MS analysis on the 13C-labeled product showed good agreement with that of the theoretically 13C-labeled product (Fig. 1B) by comparison of natural abundance (Fig. 1A) (tR = 6.73 min; m/z 292 (M+, 54%), 276 (26%), 246 (12%), 158 (60%), 144 (100%), and 113 (79%)).

In this paper we investigated the potential intrinsic photoresponsiveness of the rat RGC line, RGC-5, by testing for the presence of visual and non-visual opsins and assessing expression of the immediate-early gene protein c-Fos and changes in intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization in response to brief light pulses. Cultured RGC-5 cells express a number of photopigment mRNAs such as retinal G protein coupled receptor (RGR), encephalopsin/panopsin (Opn3), neuropsin (Opn5) and cone opsin (Opn1mw) but not melanopsin (Opn4) or rhodopsin. Opn5 immunoreactivity was observed in RGC-5 cells and in the inner retina of rat, mainly localized in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Furthermore, white light pulses of different intensities and durations elicited changes both in intracellular Ca(2+) levels and in the induction of c-Fos protein in RGC-5 cell cultures. The results demonstrate that RGC-5 cells expressing diverse putative functional photopigments display intrinsic photosensitivity which accounts for the photic induction of c-Fos protein and changes in intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization. The presence of Opn5 in the GCL of the rat retina suggests the existence of a novel type of photoreceptor cell."
https://openalex.org/W2054810290,"Inhibitory motor control is a core function of cognitive control. Evidence from diverse experimental approaches has linked this function to a mostly right-lateralized network of cortical and subcortical areas, wherein a signal from the frontal cortex to the basal ganglia is believed to trigger motor-response cancellation. Recently, however, it has been recognized that in the context of typical motor-control paradigms those processes related to actual response inhibition and those related to the attentional processing of the relevant stimuli are highly interrelated and thus difficult to distinguish. Here, we used fMRI and a modified Stop-signal task to specifically examine the role of perceptual and attentional processes triggered by the different stimuli in such tasks, thus seeking to further distinguish other cognitive processes that may precede or otherwise accompany the implementation of response inhibition. In order to establish which brain areas respond to sensory stimulation differences by rare Stop-stimuli, as well as to the associated attentional capture that these may trigger irrespective of their task-relevance, we compared brain activity evoked by Stop-trials to that evoked by Go-trials in task blocks where Stop-stimuli were to be ignored. In addition, region-of-interest analyses comparing the responses to these task-irrelevant Stop-trials, with those to typical relevant Stop-trials, identified separable activity profiles as a function of the task-relevance of the Stop-signal. While occipital areas were mostly blind to the task-relevance of Stop-stimuli, activity in temporo-parietal areas dissociated between task-irrelevant and task-relevant ones. Activity profiles in frontal areas, in turn, were activated mainly by task-relevant Stop-trials, presumably reflecting a combination of triggered top-down attentional influences and inhibitory motor-control processes."
https://openalex.org/W2085809843,"Combinations of LIM homeodomain proteins form a transcriptional ""LIM code"" to direct the specification of neural cell types. Two paralogous pairs of LIM homeodomain proteins, LIM homeobox protein 3/4 (Lhx3/Lhx4) and Islet-1/2 (Isl1/Isl2), are expressed in developing ventral motor neurons. Lhx3 and Isl1 interact within a well characterized transcriptional complex that triggers motor neuron development, but it was not known whether Lhx4 and Isl2 could participate in equivalent complexes. We have identified an Lhx3-binding domain (LBD) in Isl2 based on sequence homology with the Isl1(LBD) and show that both Isl2(LBD) and Isl1(LBD) can bind each of Lhx3 and Lhx4. X-ray crystal- and small-angle x-ray scattering-derived solution structures of an Lhx4·Isl2 complex exhibit many similarities with that of Lhx3·Isl1; however, structural differences supported by mutagenic studies reveal differences in the mechanisms of binding. Differences in binding have implications for the mode of exchange of protein partners in transcriptional complexes and indicate a divergence in functions of Lhx3/4 and Isl1/2. The formation of weaker Lhx·Isl complexes would likely be masked by the availability of the other Lhx·Isl complexes in postmitotic motor neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2029036737,"Physiological responses to temperature reflect the evolutionary adaptations of organisms to their thermal environment and the capability of animals to tolerate thermal stress. Contrary to conventional metabolism theory, increasing environmental temperatures have been shown to reduce metabolic rate in rocky-eulittoral-fringe species inhabiting highly variable environments, possibly as a strategy for energy conservation. To study the physiological adaptations of an intertidal-subtidal species to the extreme and unpredictable heat stress of the intertidal zone, oxygen consumption rate and heat shock protein expression were quantified in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. Using simulate natural temperatures, the relationship between temperature, physiological performance (oxygen consumption and heat shock proteins) and thermotolerance were assessed. Depression of oxygen consumption rate and upregulation of heat shock protein genes (hsps) occurred in sequence when ambient temperature was increased from 24 to 30°C. Large-scale mortality of the sea cucumber occurred when temperatures rose beyond 30°C, suggesting that the upregulation of heat shock proteins and mortality are closely related to the depression of aerobic metabolism, a phenomenon that is in line with the concept of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT). The physiologically-related thermotolerance of this sea cucumber should be an adaptation to its local environment."
https://openalex.org/W2064926664,"Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) can have direct antimicrobial activity, which is apparently related to the presence of a distinct positively charged patch on the surface. However, chemokines can retain antimicrobial activity upon linearization despite the loss of their positive patch, thus questioning the importance of this patch for activity. Thrombocidin-1 (TC-1) is a microbicidal protein isolated from human blood platelets. TC-1 only differs from the chemokine NAP-2/CXCL7 by a two-amino acid C-terminal deletion, but this truncation is crucial for antimicrobial activity. We assessed the structure-activity relationship for antimicrobial activity of TC-1. Reduction of the charge of the TC-1-positive patch by replacing lysine 17 with alanine reduced the activity against bacteria and almost abolished activity against the yeast Candida albicans. Conversely, augmentation of the positive patch by increasing charge density or size resulted in a 2-3-fold increased activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis but did not substantially affect activity against C. albicans. Reduction of TC-1 resulted in loss of the folded conformation, but this disruption of the positive patch did not affect antimicrobial activity. Using overlapping 15-mer synthetic peptides, we demonstrate peptides corresponding to the N-terminal part of TC-1 to have similar antimicrobial activity as intact TC-1. Although we demonstrate that the positive patch is essential for activity of folded TC-1, unfolded TC-1 retained antimicrobial activity despite the absence of a positive patch. This activity is probably exerted by a linear peptide stretch in the N-terminal part of the molecule. We conclude that intact TC-1 and unfolded TC-1 exert antimicrobial activity via distinct structural elements."
https://openalex.org/W2146871910,"Sound production and hearing sensitivity of ectothermic animals are affected by the ambient temperature. This is the first study investigating the influence of temperature on both sound production and on hearing abilities in a fish species, namely the neotropical Striped Raphael catfish Platydoras armatulus.Doradid catfishes produce stridulation sounds by rubbing the pectoral spines in the shoulder girdle and drumming sounds by an elastic spring mechanism which vibrates the swimbladder. Eight fish were acclimated for at least three weeks to 22°, then to 30° and again to 22°C. Sounds were recorded in distress situations when fish were hand-held. The stridulation sounds became shorter at the higher temperature, whereas pulse number, maximum pulse period and sound pressure level did not change with temperature. The dominant frequency increased when the temperature was raised to 30°C and the minimum pulse period became longer when the temperature decreased again. The fundamental frequency of drumming sounds increased at the higher temperature. Using the auditory evoked potential (AEP) recording technique, the hearing thresholds were tested at six different frequencies from 0.1 to 4 kHz. The temporal resolution was determined by analyzing the minimum resolvable click period (0.3-5 ms). The hearing sensitivity was higher at the higher temperature and differences were more pronounced at higher frequencies. In general, latencies of AEPs in response to single clicks became shorter at the higher temperature, whereas temporal resolution in response to double-clicks did not change.These data indicate that sound characteristics as well as hearing abilities are affected by temperatures in fishes. Constraints imposed on hearing sensitivity at different temperatures cannot be compensated even by longer acclimation periods. These changes in sound production and detection suggest that acoustic orientation and communication are affected by temperature changes in the neotropical catfish P. armatulus."
https://openalex.org/W1977829701,"P2X receptors show marked variations in the time-course of response to ATP application from rapidly desensitizing P2X1 receptors to relatively sustained P2X2 receptors. In this study we have used chimeras between human P2X1 and P2X2 receptors in combination with mutagenesis to address the contribution of the extracellular ligand binding loop, the transmembrane channel, and the intracellular regions to receptor time-course. Swapping either the extracellular loop or both transmembrane domains (TM1 and -2) between the P2X1 and P2X2 receptors had no effect on the time-course of ATP currents in the recipient receptor. These results suggest that the agonist binding and channel-forming portions of the receptor do not play a major role in the control of the time-course. In contrast replacing the amino terminus of the P2X1 receptor with that from the non-desensitizing P2X2 receptor (P2X1-2N) slowed desensitization, and the mirror chimera induced rapid desensitization in the P2X2-1N chimera. These reciprocal effects on time-course can be replicated by changing four variant amino acids just before the first transmembrane (TM1) segment. These pre-TM1 residues also had a dominant effect on chimeras where both TMs had been transferred; mutating the variant amino acids 21-23 to those found in the P2X2 receptor removed desensitization from the P2X1-2TM1/-2 chimera, and the reciprocal mutants induced rapid desensitization in the non-desensitizing P2X2-1TM1/-2 chimera. These results suggest that the intracellular amino terminus, in particular the region just before TM1, plays a dominant role in the regulation of the time-course of ATP evoked P2X receptor currents."
https://openalex.org/W2047267718,"Matrix metalloproteinase 10 (MMP-10; stromelysin 2) is a member of a large family of structurally related matrix metalloproteinases, many of which have been implicated in tumor progression, invasion and metastasis. We recently identified Mmp10 as a gene that is highly induced in tumor-initiating lung bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) upon activation of oncogenic Kras in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. However, the potential role of Mmp10 in lung tumorigenesis has not been addressed. Here, we demonstrate that Mmp10 is overexpressed in lung tumors induced by either the smoke carcinogen urethane or oncogenic Kras. In addition, we report a significant reduction in lung tumor number and size after urethane exposure or genetic activation of oncogenic Kras in Mmp10 null (Mmp10(-/-)) mice. This inhibitory effect is reflected in a defect in the ability of Mmp10-deficient BASCs to expand and undergo transformation in response to urethane or oncogenic Kras in vivo and in vitro, demonstrating a role for Mmp10 in the tumor-initiating activity of Kras-transformed lung stem cells. To determine the potential relevance of MMP10 in human cancer we analyzed Mmp10 expression in publicly-available gene expression profiles of human cancers. Our analysis reveals that MMP10 is highly overexpressed in human lung tumors. Gene set enhancement analysis (GSEA) demonstrates that elevated MMP10 expression correlates with both cancer stem cell and tumor metastasis genomic signatures in human lung cancer. Finally, Mmp10 is elevated in many human tumor types suggesting a widespread role for Mmp10 in human malignancy. We conclude that Mmp10 plays an important role in lung tumor initiation via maintenance of a highly tumorigenic, cancer-initiating, stem-like cell population, and that Mmp10 expression is associated with stem-like, highly metastatic genotypes in human lung cancers. These results indicate that Mmp10 may represent a novel therapeutic approach to target lung cancer stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2090481634,"The high-affinity interaction between the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its glycolipid-anchored receptor (uPAR) plays a regulatory role for both extravascular fibrinolysis and uPAR-mediated adhesion and migration on vitronectin-coated surfaces. We have recently proposed that the adhesive function of uPAR is allosterically regulated via a ""tightening"" of its three-domain structure elicited by uPA binding. To challenge this proposition, we redesigned the uPAR structure to limit its inherent conformational flexibility by covalently tethering domains DI and DIII via a non-natural interdomain disulfide bond (uPAR(H47C-N259C)). The corresponding soluble receptor has 1) a smaller hydrodynamic volume, 2) a higher content of secondary structure, and 3) unaltered binding kinetics towards uPA. Most importantly, the purified uPAR(H47C-N259C) also displays a gain in affinity for the somatomedin B domain of vitronectin compared with uPAR(wt), thus recapitulating the improved affinity that accompanies uPA-uPAR(wt) complex formation. This functional mimicry is, intriguingly, operational also in a cellular setting, where it controls lamellipodia formation in uPAR-transfected HEK293 cells adhering to vitronectin. In this respect, the engineered constraint in uPAR(H47C-N259C) thus bypasses the regulatory role of uPA binding, resulting in a constitutively active uPAR. In conclusion, our data argue for a biological relevance of the interdomain dynamics of the glycolipid-anchored uPAR on the cell surface."

Promotion of cancer cell proliferation by K(V)10.1 depends largely on ion flow, but some oncogenic properties remain in the absence of ion permeation. Additionally, K(V)10.1 surface populations are small compared to large intracellular pools. Control of protein turnover within cells is key to both cellular plasticity and homeostasis, and therefore we set out to analyze how endocytic trafficking participates in controlling K(V)10.1 intracellular distribution and life cycle. To follow plasma membrane K(V)10.1 selectively, we generated a modified channel of displaying an extracellular affinity tag for surface labeling by α-bungarotoxin. This modification only minimally affected K(V)10.1 electrophysiological properties. Using a combination of microscopy and biochemistry techniques, we show that K(V)10.1 is constitutively internalized involving at least two distinct pathways of endocytosis and mainly sorted to lysosomes. This occurs at a relatively fast rate. Simultaneously, recycling seems to contribute to maintain basal K(V)10.1 surface levels. Brief K(V)10.1 surface half-life and rapid lysosomal targeting is a relevant factor to be taken into account for potential drug delivery and targeting strategies directed against K(V)10.1 on tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2063473829,"A number of signaling molecules are involved in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by G protein-coupled receptors. In this study, we have demonstrated that α(2B)-adrenergic receptor (α(2B)-AR) interacts with ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), a small GTPase involved in vesicle-mediated trafficking, in an agonist activation-dependent manner and that the interaction is mediated through a unique double Trp motif in the third intracellular loop of the receptor. Interestingly, mutation of the double Trp motif and siRNA-mediated depletion of ARF1 attenuate α(2B)-AR-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) without altering receptor intracellular trafficking, whereas expression of the constitutively active mutant ARF1Q71L and ARNO, a GDP-GTP exchange factor of ARF1, markedly enhances the activation of Raf1, MEK1, and ERK1/2. These data strongly demonstrate that the small GTPase ARF1 modulates ERK1/2 activation by α(2B)-AR and provide the first evidence indicating a novel function for ARF1 in regulating the MAPK signaling pathway."

Stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated virus expressing Cre recombinase (AAV-Cre) into the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), where dopaminergic cell bodies locate, specifically inactivated the Th gene.

The dopaminergic system is important for many brain functions, including voluntary movements (1Graybiel A.M. Canales J.J. Capper-Loup C. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: S71-S77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and reward-related behaviors (2Schultz W. Trends Neurosci. 2007; 30: 203-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The dysfunction of dopaminergic transmission is involved in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson disease (3Fahn S. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 991: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), addiction (4Grace A.A. Floresco S.B. Goto Y. Lodge D.J.

Neuron. 2010; 65: 585-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Although chronic alterations in the dopaminergic system may be relevant to these disorders, it is still unclear how the dopaminergic system is regulated over days to months. In Parkinson disease, motor symptoms exhibit only after a large loss of striatal dopamine (7Bernheimer H. Birkmayer W. Hornykiewicz O. Jellinger K. Seitelberger F. J. Neurol. Sci. 1973; 20: 415-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2204) Google Scholar), suggesting compensation for the loss of dopamine. Although studies on Parkinson disease have suggested multiple forms of compensatory mechanisms, including enhanced dopamine release and turnover (8Bezard E. Gross C.E. Brotchie J.M.

Chronic intervention in the dopamine system has been performed for many years by pharmacological methods although they exhibit limitations related to dose dependence, drug metabolism, and circuit specificity.

To explore the regulatory mechanisms of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in the adult brain, we generated mice in which dopamine synthesis can be selectively abrogated in a spatio-temporally controlled manner. The nigrostriatal projection is the largest dopaminergic projection in the brain, and the dense dopaminergic axon terminals in the striatum are readily investigated in isolation from their cell bodies and dendrites. Because tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) 3The abbreviations used are: THtyrosine hydroxylaseAADCaromatic L-amino acid decarboxylaseAAVadeno-associated virusAAV-Creadeno-associated virus expressing Cre recombinaseDAdopamineDATdopamine transporterDOPAC3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acidHVAhomovanillic acidl-DOPAl-dihydroxyphenylalaninevMAT2vesicular monoamine transporter 2SNcsubstantia nigra pars compacta6-OHDA6-hydroxydopamineGBR129091-[2-[bis-(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine dihydrochloride. is the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis (18Nagatsu T.

Our biochemical and histochemical analyses suggest two regulatory mechanisms of axonal TH for dopamine homeostasis in the nigrostriatal projection. First, the TH protein level in axon terminals is regulated differently from that in soma. Second, in vivo apparent l-DOPA synthesis activity per TH protein level in a given axon is influenced by dopamine synthesis in the neighboring axons, which we propose as trans-axonal regulation of dopamine levels. To construct the targeting vector for generating a floxed Th allele, a 9.5-kb XhoI-EcoRI genomic DNA segment containing genomic Th DNA was isolated from a λ phage 129SV mouse genomic library. The EcoRI site located at the 3′-end was replaced by MluI, a HindIII restriction site was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis between exons 5 and 6, and the SpeI site located between exons 9 and 10 was converted into a NotI site. A loxP site and an EcoRV restriction site were inserted into a HindIII site, and a neomycin-resistant cassette, flanked by loxP sites, was inserted into a NotI site. The three loxP sites in the final targeting vector were in the same orientation (3′ to 5′) (Fig. 1A). Mouse embryonic stem cells were electroporated with the targeting vector, and the homologously recombinated clones were screened by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Embryonic stem clones with three loxP sites were selected, and a plasmid expressing Cre DNA recombinase was transiently transfected into the cells. Embryonic stem cells with two loxP sites without a neomycin cassette were selected by PCR and used for production of chimeric mice. The genotypes of mice were identified on mouse ear biopsies by PCR (30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 3 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min) with primers TH9F (5′-CATTTGCCCAGTTCTCCCAG-3′) and TH10R (5′-AGAGATGCAAGTCCAATGTC-3′). The sizes of the PCR products amplified from the wild-type Th allele and from the floxed Th allele are 431 and 513 bp, respectively. For the detection of recombined Th alleles, genomic DNA was extracted from the substantia nigra regions of brain slices fixed by paraformaldehyde. The recombined Th alleles were detected by PCR (30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 66 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min 15 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min) with primers TH5F (5′-AGGCGTATCGCCAGCGCC-3′) and TH10Rb (5′-CCCCAGAGATGCAAGTCCAATGTC-3′). The sizes of the PCR products amplified from the wild-type Th allele, floxed Th allele, and deleted Th allele are 1722, 1886, and 430 bp, respectively. We generated two types of AAV-Cre vectors basically as described previously (19Li X.G. Okada T. Kodera M. Nara Y. Takino N. Muramatsu C. Ikeguchi K. Urano F. Ichinose H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Nakano I. Ozawa K. Muramatsu S. Mol. Ther. 2006; 13: 160-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). One was the AAV-Cre vector, which contained an expression cassette with a human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (CMV promoter), followed by the first intron of human growth hormone, Cre recombinase cDNA, and simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal sequence (SV40 poly(A)), between the inverted terminal repeats of the AAV-2 genome. The other was the AAV-GFP/Cre vector, which contained an expression cassette with a synapsin I promoter (21Dittgen T. Nimmerjahn A. Komai S. Licznerski P. Waters J. Margrie T.W. Helmchen F. Denk W. Brecht M. Osten P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 18206-18211Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), followed by AcGFP1 (Clontech), the internal ribosomal entry site, Cre recombinase cDNA, and simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal sequence (SV40 poly(A)), between the inverted terminal repeats of the AAV-1 genome. The two helper plasmids, pHLP19 and pladeno1 (Avigen, Alameda, CA), harbored the AAV rep and cap genes as well as the E2A, E4, and VA RNA genes of the adenovirus genome, respectively. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the vector plasmid, pHLP19, and pladeno1 by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The AAV vectors were then harvested and purified by two rounds of continuous iodoxale ultracentrifugations. Vector titers were determined by quantitative DNA dot-blot hybridization or by quantitative PCR of DNase I-treated vector stocks. We routinely obtained 1012 to 1013 vector genome copies/ml. Mice were acclimated to and maintained at 25 °C under a 12-h light/dark cycle (light on 08:00–20:00). All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the general guidelines of the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Unilateral injections into the SNc were performed on 12–16-week-old mice that were anesthetized with Nembutal (intraperitoneally) and mounted into a stereotaxic apparatus. The coordinates were 3.0 mm posterior from bregma, 1.0 mm lateral to midline, and 4.0 mm ventral from the dural surface. 1 μl of AAV-Cre or AAV-GFP/Cre (about 109 particles) was injected through an injection cannula (28-gauge) with a Hamilton microsyringe driven by a microdialysis pump at a rate of 0.2 μl/min. After microinjection, the injection cannula was left for 2 min before its withdrawal to reduce the efflux of injected liquid along the injection tract. When a cannula was blocked or leaked, the mouse was excluded from the following experiments. The mice were sacrificed at 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 weeks after microinjection for analyses. We used the uninjected side of a brain as a control side to compare with. Th+/+ mice were used as control animals. Striatal slices were prepared by transcardial perfusion with saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde, 60 mm phosphate buffer, and postfixation overnight. All solutions were used at 4 °C. In some experiments, striatal tissues were dissected and homogenized for Western blot and monoamine assay (see below), and the rest of the brain, including the midbrain with the SNc region, was fixed by immersing in 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS overnight. The fixed brain pieces were cryoprotected by 30% sucrose, and the coronal slices of 30-μm thickness were cut by a cryostat. The free floating serial coronal sections, from the rostral to the caudal edge of SNc or a part of the striatum, were incubated with rabbit anti-TH antibody (1:10,000; Millipore) or rabbit anti-AADC serum (1:20,000) (12Kobayashi K. Morita S. Sawada H. Mizuguchi T. Yamada K. Nagatsu I. Hata T. Watanabe Y. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27235-27243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), followed by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:250; Vector Laboratories) and avidin-peroxidase complex (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories). Immunocomplexes were visualized by a reaction with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.003% H2O2. Images were taken using an upright microscope (Eclipse E800, Nikon) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (VB-6010, Keyence). The numbers of TH-positive neurons in the injected and uninjected side SNc were compared using a stereological cell counting method. SNc was defined according to the brain atlas (22Paxinos G. Franklin K.B. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA2004Google Scholar). Briefly, one in every three coronal sections covering the whole SNc was selected (typically 12–14 sections) and stained for TH, and magnified images of SNc were taken using a 20× objective lens (numerical aperture 0.5). For each region of interest, images were taken at multiple different focus planes to visualize all cells in the thickness. The number of all TH-positive cells in SNc in each slice was counted manually with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Only cells with an apparently visible nucleus were included. The number of all TH-positive neurons from a set of slices was summed (typically 1600–2000 cells in the uninjected side), and the ratio of the number in the injected side to that in the uninjected side was evaluated. For fluorescence immunohistochemistry, the following secondary antibodies were used: Alexa546-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000; Invitrogen) and Alexa633-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:2,000; Invitrogen). Images were taken using the TCS SPE confocal microscope (Leica) with a 63× oil objective lens and excitation lasers of 532 and 635 nm. For the detection of dopamine, we fixed mice transcardially with 5% glutaraldehyde, and the brain sections made with vibratome were stained with rabbit anti-TH antibody or rabbit anti-dopamine-glutaraldehyde conjugate (1:500; Millipore). Because glutaraldehyde fixation induces very strong background fluorescence, we performed immunodetection with the avidin-peroxidase complex as described above instead of fluorescence detection. To dissect striatal tissues for biochemical assays, we first made a coronal section of 2-mm thickness from approximately +1.5 to 0.5 mm to the bregma using a brain matrix (Neuroscience, Inc., Tokyo). Then the left and right dorsal striata were dissected by a surgical blade under a stereo microscope and homogenized using the Pellet Mixer (TreffLab) in 150 μl of PBS containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm pargyline, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of the supernatant was used for the monoamine assay. In some experiments, ventral midbrain homogenates were prepared similarly, except the positions of coronal sections were approximately −2.5 to −4.5 mm to the bregma. The striatal or ventral midbrain homogenates containing 10 μg of protein were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membranes were immunodetected using the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-TH antibody (1:10,000; Millipore), rabbit anti-AADC antibody (1:20,000) (12Kobayashi K. Morita S. Sawada H. Mizuguchi T. Yamada K. Nagatsu I. Hata T. Watanabe Y. Fujita K. Nagatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27235-27243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), or mouse anti-β-actin antibody (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and Immobilon-Western (Millipore). Quantitative analyses were performed with LAS-3000 (Fujifilm). For better quantification of low level TH proteins by Western blot, we assessed the linearity of the detection using serial dilution of striatal homogenates of the uninjected side (supplemental Fig. 1). Then we employed a range showing a linear relationship between actual loaded proteins (2.5–20 μg, or a 0.125–1.0 ratio) and measured TH protein levels (0.05–1 ratio). Within this range, we made a standard curve and calibrated the TH protein levels accordingly. For detection of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (vMAT2) and dopamine transporter (DAT) proteins, a crude synaptosomal fraction was prepared by homogenizing striatal tissues in 4 mm HEPES buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose, 2 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm pargyline. The homogenate was centrifuged at 900 × g, the supernatant was further centrifuged at 14,500 × g, and the resulting pellet (P2 fraction) was dissolved in 80 μl of the same HEPES buffer containing 1% SDS. Protein concentration was determined by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). 20 μg of each protein sample was analyzed by Western blot using the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-vMAT2 antiserum (1:500; Synaptic Systems), rabbit anti-DAT antibody (1:500; Millipore), rabbit anti-TH antibody (1:10,000; Millipore), or mouse anti-β-actin antibody (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich). For the detection of phospho-TH proteins, striatal homogenates were prepared by immediate boiling of a whole brain for 5 min after dissection, followed by isolation of striata and homogenization and sonication in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) buffer containing 1% SDS. Protein concentration was determined by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). 60 μg of each protein sample was analyzed by Western blot using the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-Ser(P)-40-TH antibody (1:2,000; Millipore), rabbit anti-p31-TH antibody (1:2,000; Millipore), or rabbit anti-TH antibody (1:10,000; Millipore). Aliquots of striatal supernatant were deproteinized by 60 mm perchloric acid with 30 μm EDTA and 30 μm pargyline on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The monoamine levels in the supernatant were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an SC5-ODS column (EICOM) and a mobile phase buffer containing 84 mm acetic acid-citrate (pH 3.5), 5 μg/ml EDTA, 190 mg/ml sodium 1-octane sulfonate, and 16% methanol. Monoamines were detected by electrochemical detection (ECD-100, EICOM). Biopterin contents were measured as described previously (43Fukushima T. Nixon J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; : 176-188102. 1980; : 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Briefly, the deproteinized homogenates were oxidized by 0.1 m HCl containing 0.1% I2 and 0.2% KI for 1 h at room temperature, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were neutralized by 0.2% ascorbic acid and then subjected to HPLC analyses with Inertsil ODS-3 column (GL Sciences) and a mobile phase buffer containing 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 6.9) and a fluorescence detector (excitation 350 nm/emission 440 nm; RF-10A, Shimadzu, Tokyo). In vivo l-DOPA synthesis activity was evaluated by measuring the l-DOPA levels that accumulated in 30 min after the administration of 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine dihydrochloride (NSD-1015, Sigma-Aldrich), an AADC inhibitor, to mice (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). The striatal tissues were homogenized using a pellet mixer (TreffLab) in 150 μl of PBS containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm pargyline, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of the supernatant was used for assaying protein concentration by Bradford method, and Western blot to assess the TH protein levels. Another aliquot was deproteinized by 60 mm perchloric acid with 30 μm EDTA and 30 μm pargyline on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was neutralized by K2CO3, and l-DOPA was purified by Al2O3 powder. The l-DOPA level was analyzed by HPLC with a NUCLEOSIL 100-7C18 reverse-phase column with a mobile phase buffer containing 0.1 m NaPO4 (pH 3.5), 8 μm EDTA and electrochemical detection. To evaluate the in vivo l-DOPA synthesis activity per TH protein, l-DOPA accumulation was normalized to TH protein levels estimated by Western blot. Mice were placed in a round bowl (25 cm in diameter) for 20 min for acclimation. The mice were administered with 1-[2-[bis-(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine dihydrochloride (GBR12909; Tocris Bioscience; intraperitoneal, 30 mg/kg) and returned to the same bowl, and the behavior was videorecorded. The rotations were counted by visual observation for a 60-min period immediately after intraperitoneal injection. One rotation was defined by the animal completing a 360° turning without turning back in the opposite direction. The Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon's signed rank test, or Steel's test was used as required. Spearman's rank correlation was used to evaluate a correlation between two groups. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. The data are shown as individual data points and mean values or as mean ± S.E., as indicated. Exponential and liner fittings were performed with Igor Pro 6.2 (WaveMetrics). First, we generated the floxed Th mice (Thfl/fl) in which exons 6–9 of the Th gene were flanked by loxP sites (Fig. 1A). We used AAV-Cre to induce DNA recombination in vivo by performing a unilateral stereotaxic microinjection of the virus into the SNc of the adult floxed Th mice. Microinjection of AAV-Cre into the SNc induced DNA recombination in 2 weeks when we examined the substantia nigra tissue samples by PCR (Fig. 1B). Th gene recombination was detected in the injected side SNc of the Thfl/fl mice but not in the uninjected side of the Thfl/fl mice and both sides of the Th+/+ mice. Thus, the floxed Th mice and AAV-Cre enabled us to induce Th gene ablation in the adult mouse midbrain. Using immunohistochemistry, we next examined the effect of the AAV-Cre injection on TH protein expression in the SNc. The TH protein immunoreactivity was absent in the majority of neurons in the SNc 2 weeks after the AAV-Cre injection (Fig. 2A and B). We found that the number of TH-positive dopaminergic neurons normalized to the uninjected side was reduced by as early as 2 weeks, with the mean ratios of 38, 30, and 40% at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the AAV-Cre injection, respectively, whereas they were unchanged in the Th+/+ mice (97% at 8 weeks; Steel's test, p = 0.0239, 0.0166, and 0.0061 for the Thfl/fl mice at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, respectively, compared with the Th+/+ at 8 weeks; Fig. 2C). To confirm a selective loss of TH protein, we also performed double immunofluorescence histochemistry for TH and aromatic AADC, a dopaminergic neuron marker. We used AAV-GFP/Cre for the purpose of labeling infected cells, but GFP expression in these neurons was too weak for detection, so we immunostained TH and AADC with Alexa546 and Alexa633 fluorophores, respectively, distinguishing from GFP signals. We found that the AADC immunoreactivity was preserved in the TH-negative neurons in the SNc 2 weeks after the AAV-GFP/Cre injection (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the AAV-GFP/Cre injection induced an efficient Th gene ablation without inducing cell death or damage. Moreover, AADC expression in the SNc was apparently unaffected in the Thfl/fl mice up to 16 weeks following the AAV-Cre injection, when the majority of the SNc dopaminergic neurons lost TH expression (Fig. 2E). These data suggest that dopamine is not essential for the survival of dopaminergic neurons in adult brains. The dopaminergic neurons in the SNc project their axons toward the striatum and form dense synapses (23Prensa L. Parent A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7247-7260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Matsuda W. Furuta T. Nakamura K.C. Hioki H. Fujiyama F. Arai R. Kaneko T. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), where abundant TH proteins were contained. We quantitatively examined the reduction of the TH protein in the striatum by Western blot (Fig. 3A and B). The TH protein level was gradually reduced in the AAV-Cre injected side compared with the uninjected side in Thfl/fl mice, to 75, 50, and 39% at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the AAV-Cre injection, respectively, whereas the levels were unchanged in the Th+/+ mice (104% at 8 weeks; Steel's test, p = 0.0932, 0.0071, and 0.0059 for the Thfl/fl mice at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, respectively, compared with the Th+/+ at 8 weeks; Fig. 3B). AADC protein levels did not show significant changes (Steel's test, p = 0.77, 0.92, and 0.88 for the Thfl/fl mice at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, respectively, compared with the Th+/+ at 8 weeks; supplemental Fig. 2A). We noticed that the reduction of TH protein level in the striatum could be slower than the reduction of the number of TH-expressing cells in the SNc because the difference between the two seemed remarkable at 2 weeks. To further investigate the difference, we compared the TH protein reductions in the striatum with that in ventral midbrain tissue, including SNc, using Western blot (Fig. 3C). We found that the TH protein reduction in the striatum showed a delay by about 2 weeks, whereas the decay time constants were similar (τ = 2.06 and 2.04 weeks for the ventral midbrain and striatum, respectively). We also used immunofluorescence histochemistry to examine the expression of TH and AADC in the striatum (Fig. 3D). Two weeks after the AAV-Cre injection, the number of TH-expressing axons in the injected side of the striatum of the Thfl/fl mice was only slightly reduced compared with the uninjected side, which was consistent with the Western blot data. However, the number of TH-expressing axons was decreased profoundly 8 weeks after the AAV-Cre injection. The number of AADC-expressing axons was apparently unchanged, suggesting that the axon terminals of the dopaminergic neurons re"
https://openalex.org/W2154767199,"Toxoplasma gondii has a remarkable ability to infect an enormous variety of mammalian and avian species. Given this, it is surprising that three strains (Types I/II/III) account for the majority of isolates from Europe/North America. The selective pressures that have driven the emergence of these particular strains, however, remain enigmatic. We hypothesized that strain selection might be partially driven by adaptation of strains for mammalian versus avian hosts. To test this, we examine in vitro, strain-dependent host responses in fibroblasts of a representative avian host, the chicken (Gallus gallus). Using gene expression profiling of infected chicken embryonic fibroblasts and pathway analysis to assess host response, we show here that chicken cells respond with distinct transcriptional profiles upon infection with Type II versus III strains that are reminiscent of profiles observed in mammalian cells. To identify the parasite drivers of these differences, chicken fibroblasts were infected with individual F1 progeny of a Type II x III cross and host gene expression was assessed for each by microarray. QTL mapping of transcriptional differences suggested, and deletion strains confirmed, that, as in mammalian cells, the polymorphic rhoptry kinase ROP16 is the major driver of strain-specific responses. We originally hypothesized that comparing avian versus mammalian host response might reveal an inversion in parasite strain-dependent phenotypes; specifically, for polymorphic effectors like ROP16, we hypothesized that the allele with most activity in mammalian cells might be less active in avian cells. Instead, we found that activity of ROP16 alleles appears to be conserved across host species; moreover, additional parasite loci that were previously mapped for strain-specific effects on mammalian response showed similar strain-specific effects in chicken cells. These results indicate that if different hosts select for different parasite genotypes, the selection operates downstream of the signaling occurring during the beginning of the host's immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2028421399,"DNA polyhedra are cage-like architectures based on interlocked and interlinked DNA strands. We propose a formula which unites the basic features of these entangled structures. It is based on the transformation of the DNA polyhedral links into Seifert surfaces, which removes all knots. The numbers of components μ, of crossings c, and of Seifert circles s are related by a simple and elegant formula: s + μ = c + 2. This formula connects the topological aspects of the DNA cage to the Euler characteristic of the underlying polyhedron. It implies that Seifert circles can be used as effective topological indices to describe polyhedral links. Our study demonstrates that, the new Euler's formula provides a theoretical framework for the stereo-chemistry of DNA polyhedra, which can characterize enzymatic transformations of DNA and be used to characterize and design novel cages with higher genus."

We examined the prognostic predictive value of HURP in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods HURP expression was evaluated by immunocytochemistry of fine needle aspirated hepatoma cells in 97 HCC patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A. Subsequently, these patients underwent partial hepatectomy (n = 18) or radiofrequency ablation (n = 79) and were followed for 2 to 35 months. The clinicopathological parameters were submitted for survival analysis. Results HURP expression in aspirated HCC cells was detected in 19.6% patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that positive HURP expression (P = 0.023), cytological grading ≥3 (P = 0.008), AFP ≥35 ng/mL (P = 0.039), bilirubin ≥1.3 mg/dL (P = 0.010), AST ≥50 U/L (P = 0.003) and ALT ≥35 U/L (P = 0.005) were all associated with a shorter disease-free survival. A stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazard model revealed that positive HURP expression (HR, 2.334; 95% CI, 1.165–4.679, P = 0.017), AST ≥50 U/L (HR, 3.697; 95% CI, 1.868–7.319, p<0.001), cytological grade ≥3 (HR, 4.249; 95% CI, 2.061–8.759, P<0.001) and tumor number >1 (HR, 2.633; 95% CI, 1.212–5.722, P = 0.014) were independent predictors for disease-free survival. By combining the 4 independent predictors, patients with different risk scores (RS) showed distinguishable disease-free survival (RS≤1 vs. RS = 2, P = 0.001; RS = 2 vs. RS = 3, P<0.001). In contrast, the patients cannot be separated into prognosis distinguishable subgroups by using AJCC/UICC TNM staging system. Conclusion HCC patients with BCLC stage A can be separated into three prognosis-distinguishable groups by use of a risk score that is based upon HURP expression in aspirated HCC cells, ALT, cytological grade and tumor number."

The integrin family heterodimeric transmembrane proteins serve as major receptors for extracellular matrix proteins, which play essential roles in cell adhesion and migration. Our recent proteomic analyses of ARF6 effectors have identified a novel ARF6 GTPase-activating protein, ACAP4, essential for EGF-induced cell migration. However, molecular mechanisms underlying ACAP4-mediated cell migration have remained elusive. Here, we show that ACAP4 regulates integrin β1 dynamics during EGF-stimulated cell migration by interaction with Grb2. Our biochemical study shows that EGF stimulation induces phosphorylation of tyrosine 733, which enables ACAP4 to bind Grb2. This interaction of ACAP4 with Grb2 regulates integrin β1 recycling to the plasma membrane. Importantly, knockdown of ACAP4 by siRNA or overexpression of ACAP4 decreased recycling of integrin β1 to the plasma membrane and reduced integrin-mediated cell migration. Taken together, these results suggest a novel function for ACAP4 in the regulation of cell migration through controlling integrin β1 dynamics.

https://openalex.org/W1967620607,"Written language represents a special category of visual information. There is strong evidence for the existence of a cortical region in ventral occipitotemporal cortex for processing the visual form of written words. However, due to inconsistent findings obtained with different tasks, the level of specialization and selectivity of this so called visual word form area (VWFA) remains debated. In this study, we examined category selectivity for Chinese characters, a non-alphabetic script, in native Chinese readers. In contrast to traditional approaches of examining response levels in a restricted predefined region of interest (ROI), a detailed distribution of the BOLD signal across the mid-fusiform cortical surface and the spatial patterns of responses to Chinese characters were obtained. Results show that a region tuned for Chinese characters could be consistently found in the lateral part of the left fusiform gyrus in Chinese readers, and this spatial pattern of selectivity for written words was not influenced by top-down tasks such as phonological or semantic modulations. These results provide strong support for the robust spatial coding of category selective response in the mid-fusiform cortex, and demonstrate the utility of the spatial distribution analysis as a more meaningful approach to examine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data."
https://openalex.org/W2038255280,"Patients with Malignant Mesothelioma (MM) develop unidentified auto-antibodies to MM tumour antigens. This study was conducted to identify the targets of MM patient auto-antibodies in order to try to understand more of the anti-tumour response and to determine if these antibodies might be helpful for diagnosis or prognostication. Using MM patient sera in a Western immunoblott screening strategy, no common immunoreactive proteins were identified. The sera from one long-term survivor recognised a protein band of 50–60 kDa present in cell lysates from four of five MM cell lines tested. The immunoreactive proteins in this band were identified by 2D electrophoretic separation of a MM cell line protein lysate, followed by analysis of excised immunoreactive proteins on a MALDI TOF mass spectrometer and peptide mass fingerprinting. The immunoreactive proteins identified were vimentin (accession gi55977767) and the ATP synthase (F1-ATPase) beta chain (accession gi114549 and gi47606749). ELISA assays were developed for antibodies to these proteins. Neither vimentin (median and 95% CI 0.346; 0.32–0.468 for MM patients, 0.327; 0.308–0.428 for controls) nor ß-F1-ATPase (0.257; 0.221–0.453 for MM patients, 0.263; 0.22–0.35 for controls) showed significant differences in autoantibody levels between a group of MM patients and controls. Using a dichotomized antibody level (high, low) for these targets we demonstrated that vimentin antibody levels were not associated with survival. In contrast, high ß-F1-ATPase antibody levels were significantly associated with increased median survival (18 months) compared to low ß F1 ATPase antibody levels (9 months; p = 0.049). Immunohistochemical analysis on a MM tissue microarray showed cytoplasmic staining in 28 of 33 samples for vimentin and strong cytoplasmic staining in14 and weak in 16 samples for ß-F1-ATPase. Therefore antibodies to neither vimentin nor ß-F1-ATPase are useful for differential diagnosis of MM, however high antibody levels to ß-F1-ATPase may be associated with increased survival and this warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2057330044,"N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis is a useful approach for genetic improvement of plants, as well as for inducing functional mutants in animal models including mice and zebrafish. In the present study, mature sperm of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) were treated with a range of ENU concentrations for 45 min, and then wild-type eggs were fertilized. The results indicated that the proportion of embryos with morphological abnormalities at segmentation stage or dead fry at hatching stage increased with increasing ENU dose up to 10 mM. Choosing a dose that was mutagenic, but provided adequate numbers of viable fry, an F1 population was generated from 1 mM ENU-treated sperm for screening purposes. The ENU-treated F1 population showed large variations in growth during the first year. A few bigger mutants with morphologically normal were generated, as compared to the controls. Analysis of DNA from 15 F1 ENU-treated individuals for mutations in partial coding regions of igf-2a, igf-2b, mstn-1, mstn-2, fst-1and fst-2 loci revealed that most ENU-treated point mutations were GC to AT or AT to GC substitution, which led to nonsense, nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations. The average mutation rate at the examined loci was 0.41%. These results indicate that ENU treatment of mature sperm can efficiently induce point mutations in grass carp, which is a potentially useful approach for genetic improvement of these fish."
https://openalex.org/W1999207462,"Protein dynamics is essential for its function, especially for intramolecular signal transduction. In this work we propose a new concept, energy dissipation model, to systematically reveal protein dynamics upon effector binding and energy perturbation. The concept is applied to better understand the intramolecular signal transduction during allostery of enzymes. The E. coli allosteric enzyme, aspartokinase III, is used as a model system and special molecular dynamics simulations are designed and carried out. Computational results indicate that the number of residues affected by external energy perturbation (i.e. caused by a ligand binding) during the energy dissipation process shows a sigmoid pattern. Using the two-state Boltzmann equation, we define two parameters, the half response time and the dissipation rate constant, which can be used to well characterize the energy dissipation process. For the allostery of aspartokinase III, the residue response time indicates that besides the ACT2 signal transduction pathway, there is another pathway between the regulatory site and the catalytic site, which is suggested to be the β15-αK loop of ACT1. We further introduce the term ""protein dynamical modules"" based on the residue response time. Different from the protein structural modules which merely provide information about the structural stability of proteins, protein dynamical modules could reveal protein characteristics from the perspective of dynamics. Finally, the energy dissipation model is applied to investigate E. coli aspartokinase III mutations to better understand the desensitization of product feedback inhibition via allostery. In conclusion, the new concept proposed in this paper gives a novel holistic view of protein dynamics, a key question in biology with high impacts for both biotechnology and biomedicine."

Human IgGs that bind the neisserial L7 lipooligosaccharide (LOS) are bactericidal for L3,7 and L2,4 meningococci in the presence of human complement. These strains share a lacto-N-neotetraose (nLc4) LOS α chain. We used a set of mutants that have successive saccharide deletions from the nLc4 α chain to characterize further the binding and bactericidal activity of nLc4 LOS IgG. We found that the nLc4 α chain conforms at least four different antigens. We separately purified IgG that required the nLc4 (non-reducing) terminal galactose (Gal) for binding and IgG that bound the truncated nLc3 α chain that lacks this Gal residue. IgG that bound the internal nLc3 α chain killed both L3,7 and L2,4 strains, whereas IgG that required the nLc4 terminal Gal residue for binding killed L2,4 stains but not L3,7 strains. These results show that the diversity of LOS antibodies in human serum is as much a function of the conformation of multiple antigens by a single glycoform as of the production of multiple glycoforms.

https://openalex.org/W2010288671,"An adenovirus 5 vector encoding for mouse interferon alpha, subtype 5 (mDEF201) was evaluated for efficacy against lethal vaccinia virus (WR strain) respiratory infections in mice. mDEF201 was administered as a single intranasal treatment either prophylactically or therapeutically at doses of 106 to 108 plaque forming units/mouse. When the prophylactic treatment was given at 56 days prior to infection, it protected 90% of animals from death (100% protection for treatments given between 1–49 days pre-infection), with minimal weight loss occurring during infection. Surviving animals re-challenged with virus 22 days after the primary infection were protected from death, indicating that mDEF201 did not compromise the immune response against the initial infection. Post-exposure therapy was given between 6–24 h after vaccinia virus exposure and protection was afforded by a 108 dose of mDEF201 given at 24 h, whereas a 107 dose was effective up to 12 h. Comparisons were made of the ability of mDEF201, given either 28 or 1 day prior to infection, to inhibit tissue virus titers and lung infection parameters. Lung, liver, and spleen virus titers were inhibited to nearly the same extent by either treatment, as were lung weights and lung hemorrhage scores (indicators of pneumonitis). Lung virus titers were significantly (>100-fold) lower than in the placebo group, and the other infection parameters in mDEF201 treated mice were nearly at baseline. In contrast, viral titers and lung infection parameters were high in the placebo group on day 5 of the infection. These results demonstrate the long-acting prophylactic and treatment capacity of mDEF201 to combat vaccinia virus infections."
https://openalex.org/W2084125771,"Transgenic insects are a promising tool in sterile insect techniques and population replacement strategies. Such transgenic insects can be created using nonautonomous transposons, which cannot be transferred without a transposase source. In biocontrol procedures where large numbers of insects are released, there is increased risk of transgene remobilization caused by external transposase sources that can alter the characteristics of the transgenic organisms lead horizontal transgene transfer to other species. Here we describe a novel, effective method for transgene stabilization based on the introduction of directed double-strand breaks (DSB) into a genome-integrated sequence and their subsequent repair by the single-strand annealing (SSA) pathway. Due to the construct's organization, the repair pathway is predictable, such that all transposon and marker sequences can be deleted, while preserving integration of exogenous DNA in the genome. The exceptional conservation of DNA repair pathways makes this method suitable for a broad range of organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2079156189,"Regulation of TNF gene expression is cell type- and stimulus-specific. We have previously identified highly conserved noncoding regulatory elements within DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HSS) located 9 kb upstream (HSS−9) and 3 kb downstream (HSS+3) of the TNF gene, which play an important role in the transcriptional regulation of TNF in T cells. They act as enhancers and interact with the TNF promoter and with each other, generating a higher order chromatin structure. Here, we report a novel monocyte-specific AT-rich DNase I-hypersensitive element located 7 kb upstream of the TNF gene (HSS−7), which serves as a matrix attachment region in monocytes. We show that HSS−7 associates with topoisomerase IIα (Top2) in vivo and that induction of endogenous TNF mRNA expression is suppressed by etoposide, a Top2 inhibitor. Moreover, Top2 binds to and cleaves HSS−7 in in vitro analysis. Thus, HSS−7, which is selectively accessible in monocytes, can tether the TNF locus to the nuclear matrix via matrix attachment region formation, potentially promoting TNF gene expression by acting as a Top2 substrate.

TNF, an immediate-early response gene, is induced by a variety of stimuli in a cell type- and inducer-specific manner (2Barthel R. Tsytsykova A.V. Barczak A.K. Tsai E.Y. Dascher C.C. Brenner M.B.

This element, HSS−7, does not function as a classical transcriptional enhancer but contains a highly conserved AT-rich noncoding region that binds acetylated histones, topoisomerase IIα (Top2), and HMGA1a (high mobility group protein A1a) in vitro and in vivo and that acts as a substrate for Top2 cleavage in vitro. Consistent with these observations, HSS−7 functions as a nuclear MAR in monocytes, and activation of TNF gene expression is suppressed by etoposide, a Top2 inhibitor. Thus, a region of the TNF locus that is accessible in monocytes tethers the locus to the nuclear matrix. These data demonstrate cell type-specific chromatin reorganization of the TNF locus and are consistent with sequestration of the TNF locus in a gene expression domain in monocytic cells. Furthermore, these data suggest the hypothesis that the action of Top2 at HSS−7 may promote TNF gene transcription by relieving torsional stress induced by transcription in the vicinity of the TNF locus, which would provide an additional, novel level of TNF gene regulation.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have identified HSS−7, a highly conserved cell type-specific DNase I-hypersensitive site in monocytes (but not in T cells) that is located 7 kb upstream of the TNF gene. HSS−7 is an AT-rich noncoding region that binds to proteins involved in altering chromatin organization and DNA architecture and topology such as acetylated histones, HMGA1a, and Top2. HSS−7 does not exhibit the properties of a transcriptional enhancer, but it functions as a MAR that can be cleaved by Top2. This interaction between Top2 and HSS−7 presents a potential molecular mechanism to facilitate TNF induction by LPS in monocytes, given that the Top2 inhibitor etoposide inhibits TNF gene expression.Type II topoisomerases are DNA topology-modifying enzymes that are critical in gene transcription and that relieve DNA supercoiling in a two-stage process. First, they cleave both strands of the DNA double helix and pass another uncut double-stranded DNA molecule through the cleaved segment. This is followed by religation of the cleaved segment in an ATP- and Mg2+-dependent manner (37Wang J.C. Untangling the Double Helix: DNA Entanglement and the Action of the DNA Topoisomerases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2009Google Scholar). Top2 recognizes DNA targets with high potential for the formation of secondary stem-loop structures, including hairpins, Holliday junctions, cruciforms, and crossovers (37Wang J.C. Untangling the Double Helix: DNA Entanglement and the Action of the DNA Topoisomerases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2009Google Scholar). AT-rich areas that have the potential of forming secondary stem-loop structures are found across the murine and human genomes. Given the high AT-rich content of HSS−7 and its accessibility to DNase I cleavage and, in particular, our finding that preincubation heat denaturation promotes Top2 binding to an HSS−7 oligonucleotide probe, the probability that HSS−7 can adopt such a secondary structure is high. Indeed, a computational analysis using Mfold (39Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10081) Google Scholar) predicting structures that can potentially be formed by HSS−7 revealed a variety of stem-loop geometries that Top2 would recognize (supplemental Fig. 3).As transcription proceeds, the separation of strands of the DNA duplex results in the creation of a bubble that alters the local topology of DNA by creating positive supercoils ahead of the bubble and negative supercoils behind it (40Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). We note that the TNF gene is located ∼15 kb downstream of the NFKBIL1 gene (which encodes a divergent member of the IκB family of proteins, whose function remains to be elucidated), which itself occupies >12 kb of the chromosome's length. Activation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages by the Toll-like receptor ligand LPS, via TLR4, leads to overexpression of the NFKBIL1 gene (41Ramsey S.A. Klemm S.L. Zak D.E. Kennedy K.A. Thorsson V. Li B. Gilchrist M. Gold E.S. Johnson C.D. Litvak V. Navarro G. Roach J.C. Rosenberger C.M. Rust A.G. Yudkovsky N. Aderem A. Shmulevich I. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4e1000021Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) as well as TNF (1Falvo J.V. Tsytsykova A.V. Goldfeld A.E. Curr. Dir. Autoimmun. 2010; 11: 27-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is interesting to speculate that the transcription bubble created by the polymerase II complex moving along 12 kb of the chromosomal double helix occupied by NFKBIL1 would create a number of positive writhes, or supercoils, toward the LT-α and TNF genes in LPS-stimulated monocytes. As a substrate of Top2, HSS−7 could resolve the conflicting DNA topology generated by transcription of the upstream gene and relieve the stress of excessive positive supercoiling and thus promote TNF gene transcription in activated monocytes. This is consistent with our observation that LPS-induced TNF gene expression in monocytes is suppressed by the Top2 inhibitor etoposide. Notably, our BLAST analysis of HSS−7 indicated that many similar sequences are present in intergenic regions (supplemental Fig. 2), indicating that these conserved sequences may play a specific role in gene transcription and have functions in other gene loci similar to the role HSS−7 plays in the TNF locus in monocytes.We note that although the TNF locus-flanking genes, NFKBIL1 (upstream) and LST1 (downstream), are ubiquitously expressed in both T lymphocytes and monocytes, the three closely positioned genes in the TNF locus, LT-α, TNF, and LT-β, have different patterns of expression depending on cell type (Fig. 7A). In stimulated T cells, LT-α, TNF, and LT-β are all active, whereas in stimulated monocytes, only the TNF gene is expressed, and both the LT-α and LT-β genes are silent (search of microarray-based expression profiling using ArrayExpress, available on the European Informatics Institute Database). A number of differences in chromatin organization at the TNF locus are evident in monocytes and T cells, and these can elucidate the mechanisms underlying the cell type-specific expression of genes in the TNF locus. There is differential DNA accessibility at the TNF locus in T cells and monocytes; for example, in T cells, hypersensitive sites are present upstream of the LT-α gene (HSS−3.5 and HSS−4), whereas HSS−7 does not appear (Fig. 7A). Strikingly, in T cells, the TNF promoter and the distal enhancers at HSS−9 and HSS+3, all of which activate transcription in an NF-AT-dependent fashion, undergo activation-dependent intrachromosomal interactions (Fig. 7B). The resulting double-loop TNF locus conformation would enhance efficient and relatively independent transcription of each gene by isolating TNF and LT-α in two separate loops (8Tsytsykova A.V. Rajsbaum R. Falvo J.V. Ligeiro F. Neely S.R. Goldfeld A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 16850-16855Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, in monocytes, the selective DNase I sensitivity of HSS−7 exposes a MAR, suggesting that, in monocytes, the TNF transcriptional unit is defined in a cell type-specific manner by the tethering of the locus to the nuclear matrix by HSS−7, which could selectively sequester TNF in a region of active transcription (Fig. 7C). This could be further enhanced by relief of transcription-induced topological stress via the Top2/HSS−7 interaction. Given that etoposide inhibits TNF expression in monocytes and T cells, we are characterizing additional AT-rich regions in the TNF locus that are accessible in T cells and may thus functionally interact with Top2. However, although the expression of NFKBIL1 and LST1 also provides a source of topological stress in T cells, the expression of LT-α and LT-β, as well as TNF, in T cells suggests that, in monocytes, the Top2/HSS−7 interaction plays a more selective role in TNF expression.

In contrast, in monocytes, the selective DNase I sensitivity of HSS−7 exposes a MAR, suggesting that, in monocytes, the TNF transcriptional unit is defined in a cell type-specific manner by the tethering of the locus to the nuclear matrix by HSS−7, which could selectively sequester TNF in a region of active transcription (Fig. 7C). This could be further enhanced by relief of transcription-induced topological stress via the Top2/HSS−7 interaction. Given that etoposide inhibits TNF expression in monocytes and T cells, we are characterizing additional AT-rich regions in the TNF locus that are accessible in T cells and may thus functionally interact with Top2. However, although the expression of NFKBIL1 and LST1 also provides a source of topological stress in T cells, the expression of LT-α and LT-β, as well as TNF, in T cells suggests that, in monocytes, the Top2/HSS−7 interaction plays a more selective role in TNF expression. In this study, we have identified HSS−7, a highly conserved cell type-specific DNase I-hypersensitive site in monocytes (but not in T cells) that is located 7 kb upstream of the TNF gene. HSS−7 is an AT-rich noncoding region that binds to proteins involved in altering chromatin organization and DNA architecture and topology such as acetylated histones, HMGA1a, and Top2. HSS−7 does not exhibit the properties of a transcriptional enhancer, but it functions as a MAR that can be cleaved by Top2. This interaction between Top2 and HSS−7 presents a potential molecular mechanism to facilitate TNF induction by LPS in monocytes, given that the Top2 inhibitor etoposide inhibits TNF gene expression. Type II topoisomerases are DNA topology-modifying enzymes that are critical in gene transcription and that relieve DNA supercoiling in a two-stage process. First, they cleave both strands of the DNA double helix and pass another uncut double-stranded DNA molecule through the cleaved segment. This is followed by religation of the cleaved segment in an ATP- and Mg2+-dependent manner (37Wang J.C. Untangling the Double Helix: DNA Entanglement and the Action of the DNA Topoisomerases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2009Google Scholar). Top2 recognizes DNA targets with high potential for the formation of secondary stem-loop structures, including hairpins, Holliday junctions, cruciforms, and crossovers (37Wang J.C. Untangling the Double Helix: DNA Entanglement and the Action of the DNA Topoisomerases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2009Google Scholar). AT-rich areas that have the potential of forming secondary stem-loop structures are found across the murine and human genomes. Given the high AT-rich content of HSS−7 and its accessibility to DNase I cleavage and, in particular, our finding that preincubation heat denaturation promotes Top2 binding to an HSS−7 oligonucleotide probe, the probability that HSS−7 can adopt such a secondary structure is high. Indeed, a computational analysis using Mfold (39Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10081) Google Scholar) predicting structures that can potentially be formed by HSS−7 revealed a variety of stem-loop geometries that Top2 would recognize (supplemental Fig. 3). As transcription proceeds, the separation of strands of the DNA duplex results in the creation of a bubble that alters the local topology of DNA by creating positive supercoils ahead of the bubble and negative supercoils behind it (40Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). We note that the TNF gene is located ∼15 kb downstream of the NFKBIL1 gene (which encodes a divergent member of the IκB family of proteins, whose function remains to be elucidated), which itself occupies >12 kb of the chromosome's length. Activation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages by the Toll-like receptor ligand LPS, via TLR4, leads to overexpression of the NFKBIL1 gene (41Ramsey S.A. Klemm S.L. Zak D.E. Kennedy K.A. Thorsson V. Li B. Gilchrist M. Gold E.S. Johnson C.D. Litvak V. Navarro G. Roach J.C. Rosenberger C.M. Rust A.G. Yudkovsky N. Aderem A. Shmulevich I. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4e1000021Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) as well as TNF (1Falvo J.V. Tsytsykova A.V. Goldfeld A.E. Curr. Dir. Autoimmun. 2010; 11: 27-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is interesting to speculate that the transcription bubble created by the polymerase II complex moving along 12 kb of the chromosomal double helix occupied by NFKBIL1 would create a number of positive writhes, or supercoils, toward the LT-α and TNF genes in LPS-stimulated monocytes. As a substrate of Top2, HSS−7 could resolve the conflicting DNA topology generated by transcription of the upstream gene and relieve the stress of excessive positive supercoiling and thus promote TNF gene transcription in activated monocytes. This is consistent with our observation that LPS-induced TNF gene expression in monocytes is suppressed by the Top2 inhibitor etoposide. Notably, our BLAST analysis of HSS−7 indicated that many similar sequences are present in intergenic regions (supplemental Fig. 2), indicating that these conserved sequences may play a specific role in gene transcription and have functions in other gene loci similar to the role HSS−7 plays in the TNF locus in monocytes. We note that although the TNF locus-flanking genes, NFKBIL1 (upstream) and LST1 (downstream), are ubiquitously expressed in both T lymphocytes and monocytes, the three closely positioned genes in the TNF locus, LT-α, TNF, and LT-β, have different patterns of expression depending on cell type (Fig. 7A). In stimulated T cells, LT-α, TNF, and LT-β are all active, whereas in stimulated monocytes, only the TNF gene is expressed, and both the LT-α and LT-β genes are silent (search of microarray-based expression profiling using ArrayExpress, available on the European Informatics Institute Database). A number of differences in chromatin organization at the TNF locus are evident in monocytes and T cells, and these can elucidate the mechanisms underlying the cell type-specific expression of genes in the TNF locus. There is differential DNA accessibility at the TNF locus in T cells and monocytes; for example, in T cells, hypersensitive sites are present upstream of the LT-α gene (HSS−3.5 and HSS−4), whereas HSS−7 does not appear (Fig. 7A). Strikingly, in T cells, the TNF promoter and the distal enhancers at HSS−9 and HSS+3, all of which activate transcription in an NF-AT-dependent fashion, undergo activation-dependent intrachromosomal interactions (Fig. 7B). The resulting double-loop TNF locus conformation would enhance efficient and relatively independent transcription of each gene by isolating TNF and LT-α in two separate loops (8Tsytsykova A.V. Rajsbaum R. Falvo J.V. Ligeiro F. Neely S.R. Goldfeld A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 16850-16855Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).
