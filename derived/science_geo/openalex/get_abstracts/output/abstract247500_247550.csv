https://openalex.org/W2156629568,"RNA interference is implemented through the action of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Although Argonaute2 has been identified as the catalytic center of RISC, the RISC polypeptide composition and assembly using short interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes has remained elusive. Here we show that RISC is composed of Dicer, the double-stranded RNA binding protein TRBP, and Argonaute2. We demonstrate that this complex can cleave target RNA using precursor microRNA (pre-miRNA) hairpin as the source of siRNA. Although RISC can also utilize duplex siRNA, it displays a nearly 10-fold greater activity using the pre-miRNA Dicer substrate. RISC distinguishes the guide strand of the siRNA from the passenger strand and specifically incorporates the guide strand. Importantly, ATP is not required for miRNA processing, RISC assembly, or multiple rounds of target-RNA cleavage. These results define the composition of RISC and demonstrate that miRNA processing and target-RNA cleavage are coupled."
https://openalex.org/W2141729181,"In the Drosophila and mammalian RNA interference pathways, siRNAs direct the protein Argonaute2 (Ago2) to cleave corresponding mRNA targets, silencing their expression. Ago2 is the catalytic component of the RNAi enzyme complex, RISC. For each siRNA duplex, only one strand, the guide, is assembled into the active RISC; the other strand, the passenger, is destroyed. An ATP-dependent helicase has been proposed first to separate the two siRNA strands, then the resulting single-stranded guide is thought to bind Ago2. Here, we show that Ago2 instead directly receives the double-stranded siRNA from the RISC assembly machinery. Ago2 then cleaves the siRNA passenger strand, thereby liberating the single-stranded guide. For siRNAs, virtually all RISC is assembled through this cleavage-assisted mechanism. In contrast, passenger-strand cleavage is not important for the incorporation of miRNAs that derive from mismatched duplexes.

Previous models have proposed that an ATP-dependent helicase first separates the siRNA duplex, and then the resulting single-stranded guide binds Ago2 (Zamore et al., 2000Zamore P.D. Tuschl T.

Our data indicate that the RLC loads an siRNA duplex, not an siRNA single strand, into Ago2. Which 5′ end of the siRNA duplex is lodged in the phosphate binding pocket of the Ago2 Piwi domain (Ma et al., 2005Ma J.B. Yuan Y.R. Meister G. Pei Y. Tuschl T. Patel D.J.

Structural insights into mRNA recognition from a PIWI domain-siRNA guide complex.Nature. 2005; 434: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) would be determined by the RLC. Once bound to the siRNA duplex, Ago2 cleaves the passenger strand, triggering its dissociation from the complex and the concomitant maturation of the active RISC. Passenger-strand cleavage is not obligatory but is the normal mechanism for loading siRNA into Ago2. For standard siRNAs, passenger-strand cleavage follows rapidly after Ago2 binds the double-stranded siRNA, but when cleavage is blocked by chemical modification or by mismatches between the siRNA guide and passenger strands, a slower “backup” pathway dissociates and destroys the passenger strand, liberating mature RISC. This bypass pathway explains the loading of miRNAs into RISC and the loading of silencing RNAs into complexes that are not capable of Ago-mediated cleavage. Is the passenger strand cleaved during RISC assembly? Human and Drosophila Ago2 cleave their target RNAs at the phosphodiester bond that lies across from nucleotides 10 and 11 of the guide strand (Elbashir et al., 2001bElbashir S.M. Lendeckel W.

The equivalent phosphodiester bond lies between nucleotides 9 and 10 of the passenger strand. Cleavage of the passenger strand, directed by the siRNA guide strand and catalyzed by Ago2, is therefore predicted to yield a 9 nt 5′ cleavage product. To determine if the siRNA passenger strand is cleaved during RISC assembly, we 5′-32P-radiolabeled each strand of a highly asymmetric siRNA targeting the human sod1 mRNA (Figure 1A ). This siRNA loads one strand (red) to the near exclusion of the other (blue) because it contains an unpaired nucleotide at the 5′ end of the guide (Schwarz et al., 2003Schwarz D.S. Hutvágner G. Du T. Xu Z. Aronin N. Zamore P.D. Asymmetry in the assembly of the RNAi enzyme complex.Cell. 2003; 115: 199-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). Upon incubation in Drosophila embryo lysate, the radiolabeled passenger strand was converted to a 9 nt, 5′-radiolabeled species whose accumulation peaked at 5 min, then disappeared (Figure 1A). In contrast, no 9 nt product was detected for the guide strand. The 9 nt passenger-strand cleavage fragment was also produced when this siRNA was incubated in S2 cell lysate that supports in vitro Ago2 RISC assembly and RNAi (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Next, we 5′-radiolabeled each strand of a second highly asymmetric siRNA in which the guide (red) had the sequence of the microRNA let-7. Again, when the siRNA was incubated in an in vitro RNAi reaction, we detected a 9 nt, 5′-radiolabeled product for the passenger strand (blue), but not the guide (Figure 1B). We also examined an siRNA targeting the firefly luciferase mRNA, 5′-32P-radiolabeled on its antisense strand (red; Figure 1C). When this siRNA is fully base paired, the local thermodynamic difference between the two 5′ ends favors assembly of the antisense strand into RISC (Schwarz et al., 2003Schwarz D.S. Hutvágner G. Du T. Xu Z. Aronin N. Zamore P.D. Asymmetry in the assembly of the RNAi enzyme complex.Cell. 2003; 115: 199-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar), making the radiolabeled strand the guide. Changing a C to a U at position 19 of the sense strand (blue) inverts the asymmetry of the siRNA, converting the radiolabeled strand into the passenger. When incubated in the RNAi reaction, only the siRNA in which the radiolabeled strand served as passenger produced a 9 nt, 5′ product. These data indicate that cleavage is restricted to the passenger strand of the siRNA duplex. The siRNAs in Figure 1 include examples in which the nucleotide 5′ to the cleavage site is a purine or a pyrimidine and in which the nucleotide 3′ to the cleavage site is a purine or a pyrimidine (Figure 1D), suggesting that passenger-strand cleavage does not depend on siRNA sequence. Treatment of the purified 9 nt cleavage product with sodium periodate followed by β elimination generated an 8 nt RNA bearing a 3′ phosphate, demonstrating that the 9 nt passenger-strand product contains a 2′,3′ hydroxy terminus (Figure 1E). A 3′ hydroxy terminus is consistent with passenger-strand cleavage by Ago2, which cleaves target RNAs to yield 5′ cleavage products bearing a 3′ hydroxyl group (Martinez and Tuschl, 2004Martinez J.

A micrococcal nuclease homologue in RNAi effector complexes.Nature. 2003; 425: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Consistent with the view that Ago2 cleaves the passenger strand, the 9 nt cleavage product was not produced when an siRNA, 5′-radiolabeled on the passenger strand, was incubated in ovary lysate from ago2414 mutant flies (Figure 2A ), which contain little (Deshpande et al., 2005Deshpande G. Calhoun G. Schedl P.

Distinct roles for Argonaute proteins in small RNA-directed RNA cleavage pathways.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1655-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) detectable Ago2 protein. These data also indicate that Dcr-2, which, like Ago2, produces 5′ cleavage products bearing 3′ hydroxy termini, is not the nuclease that cleaves the passenger strand, because ago2414 mutants contain normal levels of Dcr-2 protein (Tomari et al., 2004bTomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. A protein sensor for siRNA asymmetry.Science. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), and Dcr-2 needs no protein cofactors to act as an endonuclease (Liu et al., 2003Liu Q. Rand T.A. Kalidas S. Du F. Kim H.E. Smith D.P. Wang X. R2D2, a bridge between the initiation and effector steps of the Drosophila RNAi pathway.Science. 2003; 301: 1921-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Our model postulates that passenger-strand cleavage occurs as a normal step in Ago2 RISC loading and not as a consequence of association of the siRNA with Ago2 through a mechanism independent from the RLC. Passenger-strand cleavage should therefore require the core components of the RLC, Dcr-2, and R2D2 (Lee et al., 2004Lee Y.S. Nakahara K. Pham J.W. Kim K. He Z. Sontheimer E.J. Carthew R.W.

RISC assembly defects in the Drosophila RNAi mutant armitage.Cell. 2004; 116: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Indeed, both Dcr-2 and R2D2 were required for cleavage of the passenger strand, in that ovary lysates prepared from dcr-2L811fsX and r2d2 mutant flies do not cleave the passenger strand (Figure 2B). We can envision two distinct mechanisms in which an siRNA passenger strand might act as a substrate for Ago2 cleavage: in trans, after the strands separate and mature RISC has been formed, or in cis, before the two strands dissociate. A trans model predicts that passenger-strand cleavage requires the function of mature RISC, so cleavage should be blocked by an antisense oligonucleotide that binds siRNA-programmed Ago2. In contrast, in a cis model, an antisense inhibitor of RISC should have no effect on passenger-strand cleavage, although it would block the subsequent ability of RISC to cleave a bona fide target mRNA in trans. To distinguish between these two possibilities, RISC was programmed by combining Drosophila embryo lysate, a double-stranded siRNA, 5′-32P-radiolabeled on the passenger strand, and a 29 nt long, 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide in a standard in vitro RNAi reaction (Figure 3A ). The 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide contained a central 21 nt region complementary to the guide strand of the siRNA so that it could bind to and block the function of mature RISC. Such 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotides act as stoichiometric inhibitors of RISC function in vitro and in vivo (Hutvágner et al., 2004Hutvágner G. Simard M.J. Mello C.C. Zamore P.D.

Antisense-mediated depletion reveals essential and specific functions of microRNAs in Drosophila development.Cell. 2005; 121: 1097-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We monitored the production of cleaved passenger strand for both the experimental and the control reactions. After 30 min, RISC assembly was quenched by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide (Nykänen et al., 2001Nykänen A. Haley B. Zamore P.D. ATP requirements and small interfering RNA structure in the RNA interference pathway.Cell. 2001; 107: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), then a 32P-radiolabeled target RNA was added to the reaction, and we monitored target cleavage, a measure of the concentration of active RISC. Neither 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide had any detectable effect on passenger-strand cleavage (Figure 3B). Yet, in the same reaction, the 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide complementary to the siRNA guide strand, but not a control oligonucleotide of unrelated sequence, completely blocked target cleavage (Figure 3C). These data indicate that passenger-strand cleavage occurs in cis, during RISC assembly. In further support of the cis cleavage model, we found that passenger-strand cleavage of a standard, double-stranded siRNA preceded the production of single-stranded guide strand, i.e., the production of mature RISC (Figure 3D). In order to accurately measure the rate of production of cleaved passenger strand, the reaction included a 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide trap complementary to the 5′-32P-radiolabeled passenger strand. The trap oligo can bind single-stranded, cleaved passenger strand, helping to protect it from subsequent degradation (Figure S2 and below). At each time point, cleaved passenger strand was resolved from full-length passenger strand by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Single-stranded guide production was measured in parallel by native gel analysis using the same siRNA duplex, except the siRNA was 5′-32P-radiolabeled on the guide. These two assays revealed that nearly one-fifth of the passenger strand was cleaved after 2 min incubation, a time when little or no single-stranded guide could be detected (Figure 3D). This observation was counter to the trans model of passenger-strand cleavage, in which single-stranded guide would need to form prior to 9-mer production, but it concurred with the cis model, in which single-stranded guide must appear after or concurrently with 9-mer production. The observed lag between 9-mer production and single-stranded guide formation suggests that passenger-strand fragments remain paired to the guide strand for several minutes after cleavage. Only after these fragments dissociate is the guide strand liberated and available for detection as single-stranded. Control experiments (not shown) demonstrated that although the passenger-strand-specific trap oligonucleotide significantly improved capture of the 9 nt species produced by passenger-strand cleavage, the 9-mer was eventually degraded even in the presence of the trap. Thus, our method underestimated the amount of 9-mer produced from the passenger strand and therefore likely underestimated the speed of this cleavage event relative to the production of mature RISC containing a single-stranded guide. We conclude that, within the limits of detection of our assay, one molecule of passenger strand was cleaved for every molecule of guide strand assembled into RISC. Supporting this view, we have been unable to detect the production of any full-length, single-stranded passenger strand during RISC assembly (Figure 3E). We incubated an siRNA, 32P-radiolabeled on its passenger strand, in a standard RNAi reaction that contained a 29 nt, 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide complementary in its central 21 nts to the passenger strand. At each time point, the samples were deproteinized at room temperature and then analyzed by native gel electrophoresis using a gel system containing 1.5 mM Mg2+ in both the gel and the running buffer. In parallel, the analysis was performed using the same siRNA, but radiolabeled on the guide strand and using a 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide complementary to the guide. We readily detected the production of single-stranded, full-length guide strand, but were unable to detect any full-length, single-stranded passenger strand, observing only the production of single-stranded, 9 nt passenger-strand cleavage fragment. Together, the results presented in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 suggest a revised model for the assembly of Ago2-containing RISC (Figure 4A ). This model predicts the existence of a new siRNA species in the Ago2 RISC assembly pathway: a double-stranded siRNA bearing a nick on the passenger strand (yellow box 2, Figure 4A). To determine if such a species exists, we assembled RISC in vitro using an siRNA containing a radiolabeled passenger strand. At each time point, a sample of the reaction was deproteinized at room temperature in the presence of a 20-fold excess of a 2′-O-methyl oligo nucleotide containing at its center the 21 nt sequence of the guide-strand RNA, designed to prevent reannealing of the original passenger strand with the guide strand. Next, the reaction was analyzed by native gel electrophoresis. Like the gel system used in Figure 3E, this gel system could resolve the double-stranded siRNA from the heteroduplex formed between the 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide and the 9 nt passenger-strand cleavage product and from the heteroduplex formed between the 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide and the full-length passenger strand. During the first five minutes of the reaction, most of the labeled passenger strand migrated in the native gel as double-stranded siRNA, although some 9 nt passenger-strand cleavage fragment released from the siRNA duplex was also detected (Figure S2). To examine whether some of the double-stranded RNA represented the nicked duplex predicted by the model, the double-stranded siRNA population was eluted from the native gel and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis to resolve full-length passenger strand from the 9 nt, 5′ passenger-strand cleavage fragment (Figure 4B). For comparison, the total reaction was analyzed in parallel. We found that at early times in RISC assembly, the double-stranded siRNA was a mixture of guide strand bound to full-length passenger strand and guide strand bound to cleaved passenger strand. Moreover, a 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide trap intended to capture and protect the 9 nt cleavage product increased only slightly the amount of 9-mer recovered at early times (≤5 min) in RISC assembly but dramatically increased the recovery of this species later (≥10 min) (Figures 4C and S1B). These data suggest that early in RISC assembly, the 9 nt fragment of the passenger strand is protected from degradation even in the absence of the 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotide trap. The simplest explanation is that early in RISC assembly, the 9 nt passenger-strand fragment remains bound to the guide strand, in the target RNA binding cleft of Ago2, and is therefore naturally protected from nucleolytic destruction. Our data suggest that, under normal conditions, passenger-strand cleavage is the dominant mechanism for initiating siRNA strand dissociation during the production of Ago2-containing RISC. To assess more quantitatively the contribution of passenger-strand cleavage to Ago2 RISC assembly, we sought an siRNA chemical modification that would inhibit passenger-strand cleavage while leaving intact the essential structure of the siRNA. Phosphorothioate modification of the scissile phosphodiester bond inhibits Ago2-catalyzed cleavage of an mRNA target, and this inhibition is partially but not fully rescued by Mn2+ (Schwarz et al., 2004Schwarz D.S.

We surmised that a single phosphorothioate at the scissile phosphate of the passenger strand of an siRNA should inhibit passenger-strand cleavage (Figure 5A ).

MC4Rs are expressed in multiple CNS sites, any number of which could mediate these effects. To identify the functionally relevant sites of MC4R expression, we generated a loxP-modified, null Mc4r allele (loxTB Mc4r) that can be reactivated by Cre-recombinase. Mice homozygous for the loxTB Mc4r allele do not express MC4Rs and are markedly obese. Restoration of MC4R expression in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) and a subpopulation of amygdala neurons, using Sim1-Cre transgenic mice, prevented 60% of the obesity. Of note, increased food intake, typical of Mc4r null mice, was completely rescued while reduced energy expenditure was unaffected.

Disassociation of food intake and energy expenditure reveals unexpected divergence in melanocortin pathways controlling energy balance. The brain controls fat storage (i.e., energy homeostasis) by regulating food intake and energy expenditure. Sensory input is received from the body in the form of circulating hormones (leptin, ghrelin, etc.), fuels (glucose, fatty acids, etc.), and vagal afferents from the gut (for review Saper et al., 2002Saper C.B. Chou T.C. Elmquist J.K. The need to feed: Homeostatic and hedonic control of eating.Neuron. 2002; 36: 199-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). This information is integrated with cues from the outside world as well as the emotional state of the organism. The brain then initiates appropriate alterations in food intake and energy expenditure with the ultimate goal of maintaining energy balance. Obesity develops when this system malfunctions. Because obesity is linked with serious comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc.), there is tremendous interest in understanding the neuronal mechanisms by which the brain maintains energy balance. The last decade has seen the identification of a number of proteins that are critical components of this system. One such protein is the melanocortin-4-receptor (MC4R), a G protein-coupled receptor expressed by a number of neurons in the brain (Kishi et al., 2003Kishi T. Aschkenasi C.J. Lee C.E. Mountjoy K.G.

The essential role of MC4Rs is evident from the presence of severe obesity in both gene knockout mice (Huszar et al., 1997Huszar D. Lynch C.A. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H. Fang Q. Berkemeier L.R. Gu W. Kesterson R.A.

In the case of Mc4r null mice, in which energy balance has been studied in great detail, obesity has been found to be caused by the combined effects of increased food intake (hyperphagia) and decreased energy expenditure (Chen et al., 2000Chen A.S. Metzger J.M. Trumbauer M.E. Guan X.M. Yu H. Frazier E.G. Marsh D.J. Forrest M.J. Gopal-Truter S.

While the importance of MC4R signaling is clear, the neural substrate responsible for MC4R-mediated regulation of food intake and energy expenditure is presently unknown. MC4Rs are expressed widely in the central nervous system (CNS), including a number of sites that could plausibly contribute to coordinated control of body-weight homeostasis (Kishi et al., 2003Kishi T.

One site of dense MC4R expression is the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) (Harris et al., 2001Harris M. Aschkenasi C. Elias C.F. Chandrankunnel A. Nillni E.A. Bjoorbaek C.

The PVH is a microcosm of hypothalamic control as it regulates a variety of neuroendocrine, behavioral, and autonomic functions. The following findings suggest an important role for these MC4R-bearing neurons. First, the PVH receives strong input from proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, which release the MC4R agonist and antagonist, α-MSH and AgRP, respectively (Bagnol et al., 1999Bagnol D.

Second, stereotaxic microinjection of MC4R ligands into the PVH alters food intake and energy expenditure (Cowley et al., 1999Cowley M.A. Pronchuk N. Fan W. Dinulescu D.M. Colmers W.F. Cone R.D.

Third, obesity develops in mice and humans heterozygous for a null allele of Sim1 (single-minded 1), a transcription factor that controls development of the PVH (Holder et al., 2000Holder Jr., J.L. Butte N.F. Zinn A.R. Profound obesity associated with a balanced translocation that disrupts the SIM1 gene.Hum. Mol.

Fourth, the PVH has been linked with regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. The link with food intake comes from observations of marked hyperphagia in animals with PVH lesions (Gold, 1973Gold R.M. Hypothalamic obesity: the myth of the ventromedial nucleus.Science. 1973; 182: 488-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, Sawchenko, 1998Sawchenko P.E.

Comparison of the metabolic and behavioral disturbances following paraventricular- and ventromedial-hypothalamic lesions.Brain Res. Bull. 1985; 14: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The link with energy expenditure is primarily derived from studies showing direct descending inputs from PVH neurons to sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord (Saper et al., 1976Saper C.B. Loewy A.D. Swanson L.W. Cowan W.M. Direct hypothalamo-autonomic connections.Brain Res. 1976; 117: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, Swanson and Kuypers, 1980Swanson L.W.

The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus: cytoarchitectonic subdivisions and organization of projections to the pituitary, dorsal vagal complex, and spinal cord as demonstrated by retrograde fluorescence double-labeling methods.J. Comp. Neurol. 1980; 194: 555-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). The sympathetic nervous system plays a critical role in regulating energy expenditure, and the sympathetic preganglionic neurons are the final common pathway for its activation (Bachman et al., 2002Bachman E.S. Dhillon H. Zhang C.Y. Cinti S. Bianco A.C. Kobilka B.K. Lowell B.B. betaAR signaling required for diet-induced thermogenesis and obesity resistance.Science. 2002; 297: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, Landsberg et al., 1984Landsberg L. Saville M.E. Young J.B. Sympathoadrenal system and regulation of thermogenesis.Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: E181-E189PubMed Google Scholar). Another potential site of MC4R action relevant to the control of energy homeostasis is the sympathetic preganglionic neurons themselves, which also express abundant MC4Rs (Kishi et al., 2003Kishi T. Aschkenasi C.J. Lee C.E. Mountjoy K.G. Saper C.B. Elmquist J.K. Expression of melanocortin 4 receptor mRNA in the central nervous system of the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 457: 213-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). These neurons are located in the intermediolateral nucleus of the spinal cord (IML) and receive direct inputs from POMC neurons (Elias et al., 1998Elias C.F. Lee C. Kelly J. Aschkenasi C. Ahima R.S. Couceyro P.R. Kuhar M.J. Saper C.B. Elmquist J.K. Leptin activates hypothalamic CART neurons projecting to the spinal cord.Neuron. 1998; 21: 1375-1385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, Kishi et al., 2003Kishi T. Aschkenasi C.J. Lee C.E. Mountjoy K.G. Saper C.B. Elmquist J.K. Expression of melanocortin 4 receptor mRNA in the central nervous system of the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 457: 213-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Thus, it is plausible that MC4Rs on sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord could mediate melanocortin’s effects on energy expenditure. It is currently unknown whether MC4Rs in one specific brain region are entirely responsible for regulating energy balance or whether regulation by MC4Rs is distributed over more than one area throughout the brain. Also, if more than one area is involved, it is unknown whether control of food intake and energy expenditure track together or whether there is divergence in the pathways controlling energy balance, with one site controlling food intake and another site controlling energy expenditure. To understand the neuronal logic of melanocortin regulation of energy homeostasis, it is critical that these questions be addressed. Using the Cre/loxP system to manipulate gene expression in a small subpopulation of neurons, it is now possible to directly and definitively test proposed neuronal pathways. The overall goal of the present study is to genetically dissect central melanocortin pathways and identify the roles of MC4Rs on specific subpopulations of neurons. Toward these ends, we have engineered a loxP-modified, null Mc4r allele, which can be reactivated by Cre-recombinase. A distinct advantage of this reactivation approach, as opposed to transgenically reexpressing MC4Rs on a null Mc4r background, is that MC4R reexpression can only occur in sites that normally express the receptor and at levels of endogenous MC4R expression. Thus, this approach avoids expression of MC4Rs at levels and in areas where they are not normally expressed. We chose this approach of Cre-mediated reactivation, as opposed to Cre-mediated inactivation, because reexpression of MC4Rs in a functionally relevant site, in an animal that is otherwise devoid of MC4Rs and therefore obese, is expected to have significant effects on body weight. This should occur even if functional redundancy exists in neuronal pathways controlling body weight. Using homologous recombination in ES cells, a loxP-flanked transcriptional blocking (loxTB) sequence was inserted between the transcription start site and the ATG of the Mc4r gene, thus causing disruption of normal Mc4r transcription (Figure 1A ). The transcriptional blocking sequence consists of the neoR coding sequence, driven by the SV-40 promoter, with an HSV TK poly(A) (contains two AATAAA sequences) and an additional transcriptional pause signal. The function of this disrupted, null allele can be restored (i.e., “reactivated”) by the enzymatic activity of Cre-recombinase, which deletes the loxP-flanked sequences (Figure 1A). To establish that the loxP-flanked transcriptional blocker prevents Mc4r mRNA expression, an in situ hybridization for Mc4r mRNA was performed in mice homozygous for the disrupted allele (loxTB Mc4r) and their wild-type littermates. In wild-type mice, the previously described Mc4r mRNA expression pattern was detected in all areas of the CNS. Examples of this expression pattern are shown in Figure 1B, where Mc4r expression was detected in the PVH and nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (NLOT, a structure of the olfactory amygdala subdivision) and in the hindbrain in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV; Figure 1B). In contrast, loxTB Mc4r mice lacked detectable Mc4r mRNA expression in all areas, demonstrating that the loxTB Mc4r allele is indeed a null allele. Even if transcription were not completely stopped by the transcriptional blocker and a small amount of “read-through” mRNA below the detectable limit of the Mc4r in situ hybridization assay were generated, no functional MC4R protein would be made from the resulting chimeric mRNA. Both male and female mice homozygous for the disrupted Mc4r allele had severe early-onset obesity (Figure 1C, males). Furthermore, the obesity was accompanied by hyperphagia, increased snout-anus length and hyperinsulinemia, demonstrating that loxTB Mc4r mice are phenotypically identical to previously published Mc4r null mice (Huszar et al., 1997Huszar D. Lynch C.A. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H. Fang Q. Berkemeier L.R. Gu W. Kesterson R.A. Boston B.A. Cone R.D. et al.Targeted disruption of the melanocortin-4 receptor results in obesity in mice.Cell. 1997; 88: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2547) Google Scholar; see Figures S1A–S1C in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). It has previously been shown that Mc4r null mice do not respond to the food-intake-reducing effects of the MC4R agonist, MTII (Marsh et al., 1999Marsh D.J. Hollopeter G. Huszar D. Laufer R. Yagaloff K.A. Fisher S.L. Burn P. Palmiter R.D. Response of melanocortin-4 receptor-deficient mice to anorectic and orexigenic peptides.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Wild-type and loxTB Mc4r mice were injected intraperitoneally (ip) with MTII (100 μg), and food intake was recorded over the ensuing 3.5 hr. While wild-type mice reduced their food intake by 50% in response to MTII treatment, this response was absent in loxTB Mc4r mice (Figure S1D). Collectively, the observed obesity phenotype and the lack of response to MTII demonstrate that loxTB Mc4r mice lack functional MC4Rs. Cre-recombinase (Cre) mediated deletion of the loxP-flanked transcriptional blocker, and thus reactivation of the Mc4r allele leaves one loxP sequence in the 5′ untranslated region of the Mc4r gene (Figure 1A). To test whether the reactivated Mc4r allele functions similarly to a wild-type Mc4r allele, homozygous loxTB Mc4r mice were crossed with mice expressing Cre in the developing oocyte prior to completion of the first meiotic division (Zp3-Cre mice, Jackson Laboratories; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This results in deletion of the transcriptional blocker in the female germline. The resulting reactivated allele, with one loxP site in the 5′ untranslated region, was then bred to homozygosity. In mice homozygous for this reactivated allele, in situ hybridization studies revealed that Mc4r mRNA was reexpressed in a pattern identical to that of wild-type mice (data not shown). Also, mice homozygous for the reactivated Mc4r allele had body weights identical to those of wild-type mice (Figure 2A ), demonstrating that reactivation completely restores normal function of the Mc4r allele. Recently Mc4r mRNA expression has been observed in several peripheral tissues, including cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and integumentary systems (Mountjoy et al., 2003Mountjoy K.G. Jenny Wu C.S. Dumont L.M. Wild J.M. Melanocortin-4 receptor messenger ribonucleic acid expression in rat cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and integumentary systems.Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5488-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To test the role of MC4Rs on neurons in mediating melanocortin’s effects on body-weight homeostasis, loxTB Mc4r mice were crossed with mice heterozygous for the Nestin-Cre (Nes-Cre) transgene (Jackson Laboratories; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This transgene has been shown to direct Cre expression specifically to neural stem cells (Zimmerman et al., 1994Zimmerman L. Parr B. Lendahl U. Cunningham M. McKay R. Gavin B. Mann J. Vassileva G. McMahon A. Independent regulatory elements in the nestin gene direct transgene expression to neural stem cells or muscle precursors.Neuron. 1994; 12: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Therefore, loxTB Mc4r mice carrying the Nes-Cre transgene reexpress MC4Rs on neurons only. In situ hybridization for Mc4r mRNA showed reexpression of Mc4rs in all expected CNS sites. Figure 2C shows an example of Mc4r reexpression in the PVH of Nes-Cre, loxTB Mc4r mice at expression levels comparable to those of wild-type littermates. Notably, reactivation of MC4R expression specifically in neurons returned body weights of Nes-Cre, loxTB Mc4r mice to normal (Figure 2B). In addition, the increased snout-anus length observed in loxTB Mc4r mice was completely rescued by reexpressing neuronal Mc4rs (Figure 2D). Therefore, neuronal MC4Rs are responsible for mediating melanocortin’s effects on body weight and length. To establish the role of MC4Rs in the PVH, Mc4r mRNA reexpression was targeted specifically to the PVH by stereotaxic injections of AAV (adeno-associated virus) vectors driving Cre expression (AAV-Cre) in loxTB Mc4r mice (Chamberlin et al., 1998Chamberlin N.L. Du B. de Lacalle S. Saper C.B. Recombinant adeno-associated virus vector: use for transgene expression and anterograde tract tracing in the CNS.Brain Res. 1998; 793: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Anaesthetized mice were injected unilaterally with AAV-Cre, and body weight and food intake were measured for 80 days. Following perfusion, Cre immunohistochemistry was used to identify each injection site (Figure 3A ), and Mc4r in situ hybridization was performed on adjacent sections to assess Mc4r reexpression on the injected side of the PVH (Figure 3B). loxTB Mc4r mice were scored as PVH “hit” or “missed” by the presence or absence of Mc4r mRNA in the PVH. Additional control groups consisted of loxTB Mc4r mice injected with AAV-eGFP and wild-type mice injected with AAV-Cre. In both control groups, hitting or missing the PVH did not alter body-weight gain (Figure 3C). These data argue that stereotaxic AAV-injections into the PVH have no effect on body weight by themselves. In contrast, unilateral reactivation of PVH MC4Rs resulted in significantly reduced body-weight gain, compared with loxTB Mc4r mice, in which the PVH was missed (Figure 3C). PVH AAV-Cre-injected loxTB Mc4r mice were still significantly more obese than wild-type mice. There was also a trend for food intake to be lower in mice in which the PVH was hit compared with “missed” loxTB Mc4r mice (hit = 5.39 ± 0.22 g/day; miss = 5.88 ± 0.19; n = 8–11; mean ± SEM). Thus, PVH MC4Rs are involved in the regulation of body weight. Due to the low “hit rate” of stereotaxic AAV-Cre injections, generating a large number of PVH MC4R-reactivated mice is inherently laborious. The nature of individual stereotaxic injections leads to a group of PVH-injected loxTB Mc4r mice that are somewhat heterogeneous in their exact PVH Mc4r mRNA reexpression pattern. Furthermore, specific bilateral reactivation of PVH MC4Rs would be extremely difficult. For these reasons, we sought to express Cre by the use of a transgene driving Cre expression in PVH neurons. The transcription factor Sim1 is strongly expressed throughout the PVH during development and after birth (Fan et al., 1996Fan C.M. Kuwana E. Bulfone A. Fletcher C.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Crews S. Martinez S. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L. Tessier-Lavigne M. Expression patterns of two murine homologs of Drosophila single-minded suggest possible roles in embryonic patterning and in the pathogenesis of Down syndrome.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The PVH fails to develop in mice homozygous for a Sim1 null allele (Michaud et al., 1998Michaud J.L. Rosenquist T. May N.R. Fan C.M. Development of neuroendocrine lineages requires the bHLH-PAS transcription factor SIM1.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3264-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In addition, mice heterozygous for a Sim1 null allele are obese (Michaud et al., 2001Michaud J.L. Boucher F. Melnyk A. Gauthier F. Goshu E. Levy E. Mitchell G.A. Himms-Hagen J. Fan C.M. Sim1 haploinsufficiency causes hyperphagia, obesity and reduction of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To achieve PVH-specific Cre expression, a Sim1 BAC (RPCI23-20F11) was engineered, using recombineering techniques (Lee et al., 2001Lee E.C. Yu D. Martinez de Velasco J. Tessarollo L. Swing D.A. Court D.L. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. A highly efficient Escherichia coli-based chromosome engineering system adapted for recombinogenic targeting and subcloning of BAC DNA.Genomics. 2001; 73: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar), such that Cre would be driven by Sim1 regulatory elements (Figure 4A ). To localize Cre activity, Sim1-Cre transgenic mice were crossed with Rosa-eGFP reporter mice, which express eGFP after Cre-mediated deletion of a loxP-flanked transcriptional blocker (Jackson Laboratories; Mao et al., 2001Mao X. Fujiwara Y. Chapdelaine A. Yang H. Orkin S.H. Activation of EGFP expression by Cre-mediated excision in a new ROSA26 reporter mouse strain.Blood. 2001; 97: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Comparison of Sim1 mRNA in situ hybridization in wild-type mice with the eGFP immunohistochemistry in Sim1-Cre, Rosa-eGFP mice showed that Sim1-Cre transgenic mice had Cre activity in all areas that endogenously express Sim1 (Figures 4B and S2). Strong Sim1 mRNA expression and Cre activity were demonstrated throughout the PVH, the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (NLOT) and the supraoptic (SON) and posterior (PH) hypothalamic nuclei (Figures 4B and S2). Scattered Sim1 mRNA and Cre activity were also found in the medial and basomedial amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial preoptic nucleus, and in anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas, ventromedial thalamic and ventral and medial premammilary nucleus, ventral periaqueductal gray (PAG), and a small area ventrolateral to the PAG (Figures 4B and S2). However, no Sim1 mRNA or Cre activity was found in any other hindbrain areas, such as the DMV (Figures 4B and S2). In peripheral tissues, Cre was only expressed in cells of the kidney and not in pancreas, liver, brown adipose tissue, heart, or adrenals (data not shown), as previously reported for expression of Sim1 (Fan et al., 1996Fan C.M. Kuwana E. Bulfone A. Fletcher C.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Crews S. Martinez S. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L. Tessier-Lavigne M. Expression patterns of two murine homologs of Drosophila single-minded suggest possible roles in embryonic patterning and in the pathogenesis of Down syndrome.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A second line of Sim1-Cre transgenic mice showed Cre activity only in the posterior hypothalamic area, dorsal to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (PH-Cre mice; data not shown). Both, Sim1-Cre and PH-Cre transgenic mice were crossed with loxTB Mc4r mice, and Mc4r in situ hybridization was performed to analyze Mc4r mRNA reexpression (Figures 5A and S3A). In Sim1-Cre, loxTB Mc4r mice, Mc4r mRNA was restored throughout the PVH, in the NLOT, in scattered cells of the medial amygdala, and the PH (Figures 5A and S3A). PH-Cre mice showed Mc4r mRNA expression only in the posterior hypothalamus (Figure S3A). No Mc4r mRNA was detected in any hindbrain areas of Sim1-Cre, loxTB Mc4r or PH-Cre, loxTB Mc4r mice (Figure 5A). Both male and female Sim1-Cre, loxTB Mc4r mice gained significantly less weight than their loxTB Mc4r littermates (Figures 5B and 5C). Importantly, mice bearing the Sim1-Cre transgene on a wild-type background showed no body-weight phenotype compared to nontransgenic littermates (data not shown), demonstrating that the transgene, by itself, has no effect on body weight. At 12 weeks of age, male and female Sim1-Cre, loxTB Mc4r mice had only 37% and 46%, respectively, of the obesity seen in loxTB Mc4r mice. PH-Cre, loxTB Mc4r mice showed no amelioration of their obesity compared with loxTB Mc4r mice (Figures S3B and S3C), arguing that MC4Rs in the posterior hypothalamus play"
https://openalex.org/W2123184492,"Alpha-synuclein and cysteine-string protein-alpha (CSPalpha) are abundant synaptic vesicle proteins independently linked to neurodegeneration. Dominantly inherited mutations in alpha-synuclein cause Parkinson's disease, but the physiological role of alpha-synuclein remains unknown. Deletion of CSPalpha produces rapidly progressive neurodegeneration in mice, presumably because the cochaperone function of CSPalpha is essential for neuronal survival. Here, we report the surprising finding that transgenic expression of alpha-synuclein abolishes the lethality and neurodegeneration caused by deletion of CSPalpha. Conversely, ablation of endogenous synucleins exacerbates these phenotypes. Deletion of CSPalpha inhibits SNARE complex assembly; transgenic alpha-synuclein ameliorates this inhibition. In preventing neurodegeneration in CSPalpha-deficient mice, alpha-synuclein does not simply substitute for CSPalpha but acts by a downstream mechanism that requires phospholipid binding by alpha-synuclein. These observations reveal a powerful in vivo activity of alpha-synuclein in protecting nerve terminals against injury and suggest that this activity operates in conjunction with CSPalpha and SNARE proteins on the presynaptic membrane interface."

A comprehensive understanding of cellular life requires a multitiered description of its organizing principles. This involves cataloging the molecular activities of individual proteins, obtaining information on how proteins are organized into pathways and complexes, and describing how the different biological processes influence each other. A variety of genomic and proteomic strategies for systematically obtaining such information exist, including identification of genes that are coregulated by DNA microarrays (Eisen et al., 1998Eisen M.B.

An alternate approach for exploring function is to look for genetic interactions. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this has been accomplished in a systematic manner by exploiting the library of deletion strains to qualitatively identify pairs of gene deletions that lead to a synthetic sick/lethal (SSL) phenotype (Pan et al., 2004Pan X. Yuan D.S. Xiang D. Wang X. Sookhai-Mahadeo S. Bader J.S. Hieter P. Spencer F. Boeke J.D. A robust toolkit for functional profiling of the yeast genome.Mol.

Chang M. et al.Global mapping of the yeast genetic interaction network.Science. 2004; 303: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). The information collected using this approach is highly complementary to transcriptional and physical interaction data since it identifies processes that act in parallel to support viability. However, because SSL interactions are most often found between genes involved in distinct processes (Kelley and Ideker, 2005Kelley R. Ideker T. Systematic interpretation of genetic interactions using protein networks.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), interpretation of the cause and significance of such interactions is often challenging. SSL analysis, in fact, represents only a specific case of the broader phenomenon of epistasis in which the phenotypic consequence of altering one gene is modulated by the presence or absence of a second one. This includes both negative (aggravating) interactions detected in SSL studies as well as positive ones such as buffering interactions where the cost of eliminating one gene is mitigated by the loss of a second one and true suppressor interactions in which the double mutant is healthier than the sickest single mutant. Theoretical considerations suggest that comprehensive and quantitative epistatic data could provide detailed information not only on protein function but on higher levels of cellular organization (Segre et al., 2005Segre D. Deluna A. Church G.M. Kishony R. Modular epistasis in yeast metabolism.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 77-83PubMed Google Scholar). However, interpretation of such data requires high-density maps since much of the information is distributed across patterns of interactions (Segre et al., 2005Segre D. Deluna A. Church G.M. Kishony R. Modular epistasis in yeast metabolism.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 77-83PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the ability to measure positive interactions provides a critical supplement to SSL (which typically connects distinct processes) as genes that act together in a single complex or pathway will often have buffering interactions with each other. Thus, the quality and completeness of a genetic-interaction map will determine the precision by which the function and organization of proteins can be resolved. More broadly, knowledge of the spectrum of epistatic relationships is crucial for analyzing the manifestation of quantitative traits, for guiding efforts to tailor drug treatments to an individual’s genetic makeup, and for developing rational strategies for drug-combination therapies. Finally, central features of evolutionary biology, including maintenance of genetic variability, sexual reproduction, and speciation, are dependent on the structure of genetic interactions (Elena and Lenski, 1997Elena S.F. Lenski R.E. Test of synergistic interactions among deleterious mutations in bacteria.Nature. 1997; 390: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, Phillips et al., 2000Phillips P.C. Otto S.P. Whitlock M.C. Beyond the average: the evolutionary importance of gene interactions and variability of epistatic effects.in: Wolf J.B. Brodie III, E.D. Wade M.J. Epistasis and the Evolutionary Process. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 20-38Google Scholar). Efforts to construct high-density, quantitative epistatic interaction maps face three major technical challenges. First, the number of gene pairs is enormous (nearly 20 million in S. cerevisiae) and the density of interactions is low (estimated [Tong et al., 2004Tong A.H. Lesage G. Bader G.D. Ding H. Xu H. Xin X. Young J. Berriz G.F. Brost R.L. Chang M. et al.Global mapping of the yeast genetic interaction network.Science. 2004; 303: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar] to be 1 in 200 for SSL pairs involving nonessential genes). This puts a tremendous demand on the quantity and quality of data needed to generate a complete, whole-cell network of genetic interactions. However, the spatial and functional compartmentalization of cells results in “neighborhood clustering” in which there is a far higher density of genetic interactions between genes encoding colocalized and coregulated proteins (Huh et al., 2003Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O’Shea E.K. Global analysis of protein localization in budding yeast.Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar, Tong et al., 2004Tong A.H. Lesage G. Bader G.D. Ding H. Xu H. Xin X. Young J. Berriz G.F. Brost R.L. Chang M. et al.Global mapping of the yeast genetic interaction network.Science. 2004; 303: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Because the number of possible interactions scales as the square of the number of genes, screening for genetic interactions within a limited, predominantly self-contained gene subset greatly increases the density of hits (and thus the signal-to-noise ratio) while drastically reducing the number of gene pairs that need to be tested. The second obstacle is that detection of positive interactions requires quantitative comparisons between the growth of double and single mutants. This can be far more challenging than detection of SSL interactions, which involves only the identification of inviable double mutants. The collection of high-density interaction data enables an elegant solution to this challenge. Because it provides a large data set for each gene, it allows precise comparisons between the observed viability of a given double mutant and that typical of other double mutants involving each of the two genes. The final important limitation to the construction of comprehensive epistatic maps is that there is no simple method for generating hypomorphic alleles of essential genes. However, essential proteins are most likely to be conserved across phyla and to play central roles in cellular function (Giaever et al., 2002Giaever G. Chu A.M. Ni L. Connelly C. Riles L. Veronneau S. Dow S. Lucau-Danila A. Anderson K. Andre B. et al.Functional profiling of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome.Nature. 2002; 418: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar). In order to include genes essential for cell viability, we have developed a simple strategy for generating such alleles, termed DAmP (decreased abundance by mRNA perturbation), which enables large-scale genetic and functional analyses. Based on the above considerations, we present a strategy for generating comprehensive descriptions, termed E-MAPs (epistatic miniarray profiles), of genetic interactions between logically connected subsets of genes. We further describe the construction and analysis of an E-MAP of genes acting in the yeast early secretory pathway (ESP). We chose this particular subset of proteins because the pathway is spatially restricted and its central functions (e.g., lipid biosynthesis and translocation, folding, processing, and trafficking of secreted proteins) are highly conserved and crucial to many metazoan processes, including development and the function of the immune, neuronal, and endocrine systems. To enable the systematic analysis of the essential genes of S. cerevisiae, we developed a robust and efficient technique, DAmP, for generating hypomorphic alleles. DAmP utilizes simple, PCR-based homologous recombination to disrupt the natural 3′UTR by insertion of an antibiotic-resistance marker, thus greatly destabilizing the corresponding messages (Muhlrad and Parker, 1999Muhlrad D. Parker R. Aberrant mRNAs with extended 3′ UTRs are substrates for rapid degradation by mRNA surveillance.RNA. 1999; 5: 1299-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The DAmP strategy yields proteins under their natural transcriptional regulation but at substantially reduced levels (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). For the large majority of essential genes, in the absence of additional stress, the DAmP alleles are expressed at levels sufficient to support viability. This approach complements promoter replacement alleles (Mnaimneh et al., 2004Mnaimneh S. Davierwala A.P. Haynes J. Moffat J. Peng W.T. Zhang W. Yang X. Pootoolal J. Chua G. Lopez A. et al.Exploration of essential gene functions via titratable promoter alleles.Cell. 2004; 118: 31-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), which often are not well suited for large-scale genetic-interaction studies due to difficulties in achieving intermediate expression levels (N.J.K. and J.F.G., unpublished data). To evaluate the utility of DAmP alleles, we focused on five well-characterized, essential proteins of the ESP. First, we showed that DAmP alleles of two genes, SEC62 and SEC63, that encode components of the translocon have greatly reduced protein levels compared to wild-type (Figure 1A , top panel). These alleles show strong aggravating interactions with genes encoding seven nonessential components of the translocation process (Figure 1A, bottom panel). Second, we show that the DAmP strain of the major ER chaperone and HSP70 homolog, KAR2, has an approximately 2-fold reduction in protein level (Figure 1B, top left panel). Here, the relatively small decrease results from induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Figure 1B, bottom panel), an ESP-specific stress response that induces KAR2 transcription (Patil and Walter, 2001Patil C. Walter P. Intracellular signaling from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus: the unfolded protein response in yeast and mammals.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). This leads to a synthetic-lethal genetic interaction between a kar2-DAmP strain and a Δire1 strain that cannot induce the UPR (Figure 1B, top right panel). Finally, we used the DAmP method on PDI and ERO1, which together are responsible for promoting disulfide formation (Tu and Weissman, 2004Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. Oxidative protein folding in eukaryotes: mechanisms and consequences.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Pdi1p levels were greatly reduced (Figure 1C, top panel), and both strains showed the strong sensitivity to the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) (Figure 1C, bottom panels) characteristic of strains with reduced Pdi1p or Ero1p activity (Tu and Weissman, 2004Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. Oxidative protein folding in eukaryotes: mechanisms and consequences.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). The ease of implementation and robustness of the DAmP approach (illustrated here and below) now make the essential part of the yeast genome readily accessible to the type of comprehensive chemical sensitivity, genetic, and functional studies that have revolutionized the analysis of the set of nonessential genes (Giaever et al., 2002Giaever G.

We took advantage of the available functional and intracellular localization data to identify 424 genes (367 deletion strains of nonessential genes and 57 strains carrying DAmP alleles of essential ones) whose products are localized to, or impact on, the ESP (Balakrishnan et al., 2005Balakrishnan R.

By using cellular localization data derived from large-scale GFP fusion studies (Huh et al., 2003Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O’Shea E.K.

To obtain an accurate and homogeneous functional nomenclature for our genes, we assigned each protein to a functional category by reviewing the literature (Figure 2A and Table S2). We developed a strategy for providing quantitative metrics of the strength of genetic interactions. Using the synthetic genetic array (SGA) approach (Tong et al., 2001Tong A.H. Evangelista M. Parsons A.B. Xu H. Bader G.D. Page N. Robinson M. Raghibizadeh S. Hogue C.W. Bussey H. et al.Systematic genetic analysis with ordered arrays of yeast deletion mutants.Science. 2001; 294: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar), we generated double mutants for each of the genes in our ESP set. All double-mutant spores were plated under identical conditions, and colony sizes were measured by digital imaging (Parsons et al., 2004Parsons A.B. Brost R.L. Ding H. Li Z. Zhang C. Sheikh B. Brown G.W. Kane P.M. Hughes T.R. Boone C. Integration of chemical-genetic and genetic interaction data links bioactive compounds to cellular target pathways.Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). In order to quantitatively evaluate both negative and positive epistatic relationships, we needed to compare the growth rate of each double mutant to that which would be expected given the growth rates of the two single mutants. One strategy for evaluating epistatic interactions would be to directly measure the growth rate of each single and double mutant and assume, as is typically done, that in the absence of an interaction the growth defect of a double mutant will be the product of the growth defects of the two single mutants (Phillips et al., 2000Phillips P.C. Otto S.P. Whitlock M.C. Beyond the average: the evolutionary importance of gene interactions and variability of epistatic effects.in: Wolf J.B. Brodie III, E.D. Wade M.J. Epistasis and the Evolutionary Process. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 20-38Google Scholar, Segre et al., 2005Segre D. Deluna A. Church G.M. Kishony R. Modular epistasis in yeast metabolism.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 77-83PubMed Google Scholar). However, uncertainty about the validity of this assumption as well the introduction of error associated with the measurement of single mutants makes this approach less desirable. Instead, we took advantage of the comprehensive nature of our data, and the fact that significant genetic interactions are rare, to empirically determine with high precision the expected size for each double mutant given its two mutations (S.R.C. and J.S.W., unpublished data). By comparing the observed colony sizes to these expected values, we obtained quantitative (Figure S1) measures for both negatively scored (aggravating) interactions, in which double mutants grow more slowly than expected, and positively scored (alleviating) interactions, where the double mutants grow more rapidly than expected (Figures 2B and 2C). The quality of our data was greatly improved by the fact that each deletion was made independently with both antibiotic-resistance markers and both pairwise interactions were measured (Figure 2C). This 2-fold redundancy allowed us to identify incorrect strains (e.g., revertants or contaminants [∼11% of the library]), which, along with strains that gave highly irreproducible results, we removed and, when practical, replaced. Having full biological replicates also eliminated many sources of systematic error. It further provided a direct measure of the experimental variability and allowed us to evaluate rigorously the significance of our measures as a function of the observed interaction score (S.R.C. and J.S.W., unpublished data) (Figure 2C, inset). In addition to allowing the evaluation of positive interactions, our quantitative metric provided a more sensitive approach than SGA or conventional tetrad analysis for detection of synthetic-lethal interactions (see Figure 2C, Figure S2A, and the UPR analysis below). For most of the following analyses, we used a continuous score to describe interaction strength. However, where it was advantageous to have a discrete evaluation of interactions, we used a 95% confidence threshold (which corresponds to |score| > 2.5 [Figure 2C, inset]). Counting such significant interactions, we found that both the DAmP alleles of the essential and the deletions of nonessential genes, on average, showed SSL interactions with approximately 3% of this library, which is notably higher than the observed rate of 0.5% for the set of genome-wide SSL screens performed on the nonessential-deletion-mutant collection (Tong et al., 2004Tong A.H. Lesage G. Bader G.D. Ding H. Xu H. Xin X. Young J. Berriz G.F. Brost R.L. Chang M. et al.Global mapping of the yeast genetic interaction network.Science. 2004; 303: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Thus, by studying a dense, largely self-interacting set of genes, we obtained a high-confidence data set spanning a large fraction of each gene’s interactions despite screening only a small fraction of possible gene pairs. Nonetheless, concentrating on a functional subset of genes means that some interactions will be missed, and therefore it would be advantageous to combine this approach with single-gene genome-wide screens. The distribution of interactions varied widely for the different functional categories within the ESP, with UPR components having the highest mean number of interactions and uncharacterized ORFs having the lowest (Figure 2D). We selected the UPR category to evaluate experimentally the accuracy and completeness of our interaction measurements. Because deletion strains showing aggravating interactions with IRE1 typically induce the UPR, we could assess the accuracy of our scoring independently of tetrad analysis. By measuring UPR activation using a fluorescent reporter, we confirmed that 34 of the 35 nonessential genes that were scored as having aggravating interactions with IRE1 actually led to induction of the UPR. Analysis of the UPR data also argues for a low false-negative rate for genetic interactions as only 4 of these 34 genes failed to show a significant interaction with the IRE1-dependant UPR inducer HAC1 (Table S3). Once quantitative measures of epistatic interactions have been obtained for each gene, the resulting pattern of scores can be regarded as a phenotypic signature. Hierarchical clustering (Eisen et al., 1998Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Cluster analysis and display of genome-wide expression patterns.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (12828) Google Scholar) of these signatures yielded a remarkably large number of functionally homogeneous subtrees (Figure 3). Perhaps even more notable was the ability of the clustering algorithm to make subtle distinctions within cellular processes, pointing to the high precision of the phenotypic signatures made possible by the comprehensive nature of the interaction data. This analysis also highlighted the value of obtaining quantitative data as well as data on positive interactions since the quality of the clusters deteriorated substantially when such information was not included (S.R.C. and J.S.W., unpublished data). To illustrate the depth of biological information in the genetic-interaction map, we present an interaction-dense area of the cluster (Figure 3A) and highlight five functionally homogeneous trees (entire cluster and raw data can be downloaded from the authors’ website at http://phoibe.med.utoronto.ca/erg). This cluster consists exclusively of 11 well-characterized proteins dedicated to the generation of high-mannose chains. The cluster is further divided into two functionally distinct groups, one consisting of the ALG genes (involved in oligosaccharyl synthesis) and the other consisting of OST genes (involved in transfer of the sugar moiety onto nascent proteins). (See Figure 3B.) Proximal to the N-linked glycosylation cluster are genes involved in O-linked glycosylation, GPI anchor biosynthesis, and other processes required for proper cell-wall formation (Lipke and Ovalle, 1998Lipke P.N. Ovalle R. Cell wall architecture in yeast: new structure and new challenges.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within this cluster are a number of functionally homogeneous subclusters, including that of ROT2, CWH41, and CNE1. These two glucosidases and a lectin chaperone mediate sugar trimming and subsequent recognition of N-linked glycans. The presence of these genes in this cluster, as opposed to the N-linked glycosylation cluster, reflects their role in maintaining integrity of the cell wall (Shahinian et al., 1998Shahinian S. Dijkgraaf G.J. Sdicu A.M. Thomas D.Y. Jakob C.A. Aebi M. Bussey H.

Similarly, the presence of the Ca2+/Mn2+ transporter, PMR1, may reflect its described role in Golgi-mediated carbohydrate modifications (Vashist et al., 2002Vashist S. Frank C.G. Jakob C.A. Ng D.T. Two distinctly localized p-type ATPases collaborate to maintain organelle homeostasis required for glycoprotein processing and quality control.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3955-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). (See Figure 3C.) This cluster includes five essential and nonessential core components of the posttranslational translocon. Significantly, these proteins are well distinguished from those involved in cotranslational translocation, which are found in a distinct subcluster. A sixth gene in this same cluster, SPF1, while not part of the translocation machinery, is known to contribute to establishing the correct orientation of transmembrane proteins during translocation (Tipper and Harley, 2002Tipper D.J. Harley C.A. Yeast genes controlling responses to topogenic signals in a model transmembrane protein.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1158-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). (See Figure 3D.) This extensive cluster reveals multiple levels of functional organization. Globally, the distinct steps (ER/Golgi traffic, intra-Golgi traffic, and post-Golgi traffic) of vesicle transport were distinguished. Locally, there exists a high degree of functional structure (e.g., subtrees for the RIC1/RGP1 heterodimer, the COG complex, and the AP-3 complex members [APL5, APS3, APL6, and APM3]). An intriguing subtree embedded within the ER/Golgi-traffic components consists of three poorly characterized genes, MDM39, RMD7, and ARR4, which we show to be in a physical complex involved in Golgi-to-ER traffic (see below). Thus, we propose that they be referred to as"

The initiation event for the RNAi pathway is cleavage of double-stranded RNA into small interfering RNAs by an enzyme called Dicer (Carmell and Hannon, 2004Carmell M.A. Hannon G.J. RNase III enzymes and the initiation of gene silencing.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, after being generated by a specific Dicer enzyme, Dicer-2, the small interfering RNA binds to the Dicer-2/R2D2 (D2/R2) complex (Liu et al., 2003Liu Q. Rand T.A. Kalidas S. Du F.

Formation of this complex precedes and is essential to RISC formation in vitro and in vivo (Liu et al., 2003Liu Q. Rand T.A. Kalidas S. Du F. Kim H.E. Smith D.P. Wang X.

Interestingly, the D2/R2 complex orients the siRNA duplex so that the 5′ end with lower melting temperature preferentially interacts with D2 (Tomari et al., 2004bTomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. A protein sensor for siRNA asymmetry.Science. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). This orientation allows the strand with its 5′ end at the siRNA end with the lower melting temperature to become the single-stranded guide RNA of RISC, which is held by Ago2 (Martinez et al., 2002Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Urlaub H. Luhrmann R. Tuschl T. Single-stranded antisense siRNAs guide target RNA cleavage in RNAi.Cell. 2002; 110: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). RISC uses the guide RNA to find complementary mRNA sequences via Watson-Crick base pairing and endonucleolytically cleaves the target molecules phosphodiester bond between the tenth and eleventh nucleotide as measured from the guide strand’s 5′ end (Elbashir et al., 2001Elbashir S.M.

Functional anatomy of siRNAs for mediating efficient RNAi in Drosophila melanogaster embryo lysate.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Recently, Ago2’s biochemical role within the RISC complex was clarified when its PIWI domain was identified as RNase H-like by crystallography (Song et al., 2004Song J.J. Smith S.K. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L. Crystal structure of Argonaute and its implications for RISC slicer activity.Science. 2004; 305: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) and endonuclease V-like by a bioinformatics tool, metaBASIC analysis (Rand et al., 2004Rand T.A.

USA. 2004; 101: 14385-14389Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Importantly, Ago2 was identified as the sole protein required for mRNA cleaving RISC activity (Liu et al., 2004Liu J. Carmell M.A. Rivas F.V. Marsden C.G. Thomson J.M. Song J.J. Hammond S.M. Joshua-Tor L. Hannon G.J.

USA. 2004; 101: 14385-14389Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The endonucleolytic RISC activity has also been demonstrated using bacterially expressed human Ago2 loaded with a single-stranded siRNA (Rivas et al., 2005Rivas F.V. Tolia N.H. Song J.J. Aragon J.P. Liu J. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L. Purified Argonaute2 and an siRNA form recombinant human RISC.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). How the double-stranded siRNA generated by D2/R2 complex gets loaded onto Ago2 protein and becomes the single-stranded guide RNA is not clear. The prevailing model addresses the loading of siRNA by invoking a helicase activity. In this model, a helicase activity is activated or recruited upon formation of the D2/R2/siRNA complex (Meister and Tuschl, 2004Meister G. Tuschl T. Mechanisms of gene silencing by double-stranded RNA.Nature. 2004; 431: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar). Three previous observations are consistent with the existence of a helicase during RNA interference. First, siRNA-triggered RISC activity was reduced upon removal of ATP in a Drosophila embryo extract (Nykanen et al., 2001Nykanen A. Haley B. Zamore P.D. ATP requirements and small interfering RNA structure in the RNA interference pathway.Cell. 2001; 107: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Helicases utilize ATP to separate the RNA strands. Secondly, though both double-stranded (ds) and single-stranded (ss) siRNA (at higher concentrations) can activate RISC in cell extracts, only ss siRNA can be directly loaded onto recombinant Ago2 (Nykanen et al., 2001Nykanen A.

Tolia N.H. Song J.J. Aragon J.P. Liu J. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L. Purified Argonaute2 and an siRNA form recombinant human RISC.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Finally, though their biochemical roles have not been demonstrated, several helicases have been identified by genetic or biochemical studies as potentially playing a part in RNAi in various systems (Meister and Tuschl, 2004Meister G. Tuschl T. Mechanisms of gene silencing by double-stranded RNA.Nature. 2004; 431: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar). To illustrate the molecular mechanism of siRNA loading onto RISC and its subsequent activation process, we conducted a detailed biochemical analysis of this process. Our results are surprising and as reported here, suggest an alternative model for siRNA loading and RISC activation. In an effort to further understand the siRNA loading mechanism of RISC, we depleted ATP from the S100 extracts prepared from Drosophila S2 cells by treating the extracts with Hexokinase in the presence of 100 mM glucose. The removal of ATP was followed using Sigma’s luciferase-based ATP assay. After treatment, the ATP level remaining, 0.8 pM, was at the detection limit of the kit (∼2 pM) and orders of magnitude less than the mock-treated extracts (data not shown). The ATP-depleted extracts and mock-treated extracts (addition of glucose and buffer in place of Hexokinase supplemented with 1 mM ATP) were then used to measure mRNA-cleaving RISC activity and double-stranded RNA-cleaving Dicer activity. As shown in Figure 1, when compared to mock-treated extracts (+ATP lanes), the ATP-depleted extracts (−ATP lanes) demonstrated comparable siRNA-induced RISC activity (upper panel). As a control for ATP removal, we checked the Dicer activity in the same samples (lower panel). The main Dicer activity in S2 100,000 × g supernatant (S100) is Dicer-2, which requires ATP to process dsRNA into siRNA (Liu et al., 2003Liu Q. Rand T.A. Kalidas S. Du F. Kim H.E. Smith D.P. Wang X. R2D2, a bridge between the initiation and effector steps of the Drosophila RNAi pathway.Science. 2003; 301: 1921-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The Hexokinase-treated extracts (−ATP lanes, Figure 1, bottom panel) were deficient for Dicer activity relative to the mock-treated sample (+ATP lanes, Figure 1, bottom panel), which demonstrated strong Dicer activity. This result, together with the luciferase-based quantification of ATP, demonstrated that siRNA-activated RISC activity is largely ATP independent in S2 extract. This result does not support the requirement of an ATP-dependent helicase in removing the anti-guide strand during RISC activation. In light of the intrinsic endonuclease activity of Ago2, we entertained the possibility that the anti-guide strand of siRNA was removed from RISC through cleavage by Ago2 itself via the same ATP-independent cleavage mechanism used for mRNA substrates. The hypothesized cleavage of the anti-guide RNA and the subsequent release of the cleaved fragment from RISC would result in the production of two fragments from the original 21 nucleotide anti-guide siRNA strand. The 5′ fragment, containing the 5′ end phosphate, would be 9 bases long. The 3′ fragment would consist of the remaining 12 bases. In an attempt to detect the 5′ cleavage product, one strand of the let-7 siRNA was radio-phosphorylated with P32 and the other strand was phosphorylated with nonradioactive phosphate (Figure 2A ). After loading onto RISC, the RNA was recovered and analyzed by urea/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by phosphorimaging. As shown in Figure 2B, no hint of cleavage product was detected (lane 11). We reasoned that the failure to see this cleaved 9 base fragment could be due to cellular RNase activities that readily degrade non-G-capped, nonpolyadenylated small RNAs. To increase the likelihood of seeing the small RNA product, we added 100-fold excess (relative to the siRNA) of a nuclease-resistant, 2′-O-methylated, single-stranded RNA oligonucleotide that could base pair with the radiolabeled product once it was released from its complementary siRNA strand (as shown in cartoon form in Figure 2A). Using this trapping technique, we easily detected a radiolabeled RNA (Figure 2A, lanes 1–4) that perfectly comigrates with a radiolabeled synthetic RNA 9-mer of the same sequence (Figure 2A, lanes 5 and 10). A 2′-O-methylated RNA trap consisting of the complementary sequence (UGA…) did not rescue the 9-mer, demonstrating that the trap was working by sequence-specific annealing, rather than, for instance, clogging an RNA degradation pathway (Figure 2B, lane 12). Furthermore, the 9-mer RNA was completely absent in reactions using Ago2 null fly extract indicating its production was Ago2-dependent (Figure 2B, lanes 6–9 compared to lanes 1–4). Using the same procedure except the siRNA was labeled at 3′ end with 5′ α-32P-pCp, the cleaved 3′ 12-mer was also observed although the radio label is much less stable than the 5′ phosphate (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Ago2 is known to cleave target RNAs leaving a 3′ hydroxyl and 5′ phosphate at the site of cleavage (Martinez and Tuschl, 2004Martinez J. Tuschl T. RISC is a 5′ phosphomonoester-producing RNA endonuclease.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). If the observed radiophosphorylated product is in fact generated by Ago2 cleavage, it is predicted to contain a 5′ phosphate and a 3′ hydroxyl group. To test if the ends of the observed RNA fragment had these functional groups, the radiolabeled fragment was excised, gel extracted, and then used as substrate in a T4-RNA ligase reaction. T4-RNA ligase catalyzes a reaction wherein RNA ends are ligated together creating a phosphodiester bond between a 5′ phosphate and a 3′ hydroxyl ends. In a control reaction using a synthetic RNA with 5′ phosphate and 3′ hydroxyl, the addition of ligase resulted in the production of a ligated radiolabeled product that ran faster than the unligated substrate (see Figure 2C, left panel). The faster migration is likely due to a self-ligated RNA species (closed-circular), the most common product of ligation reactions. Likewise, the gel-extracted 9-mer RNA fragment could also be converted to a faster migrating ligation product, indicating that the RNA fragment contained 5′ phosphate and 3′ hydroxyl groups (Figure 2C, right panel). Ago2-dependent production of 9-mer from the anti-guide strand could potentially occur subsequent to, rather than during, the loading process. For instance, after helicase-mediated strand separation, RISC might relocate, anneal to, and cleave the previously liberated anti-guide strand (the “reunion” model). Presumably, if such a mechanism were to account for 9-mer formation, RISC activity would have to occur even in the presence of trap. To check whether this was possible, we performed RISC assays in the presence of UAU trap. As shown in Figure 2D, RISC activity was completely lost in the presence of trap, while in the absence of trap, there was normal RISC activity (Figure 2D, lanes 1–8). This indicates that there is a significant difference between the anti-guide strand cleavage activity and the mRNA cleavage activity of RISC—only the anti-guide strand cleavage activity remains intact even with a large excess of trap molecule present. The cleaved anti-guide strand 9-mer was observed at comparable levels with or without ATP (Figure 2E). This is in agreement with the observation that ATP has little effect on the total process of siRNA-triggered RISC loading and activity as shown in Figure 1. If anti-guide strand cleavage were important to the activation mechanism, chemical modification at the cleavage site would be predicted to inhibit RISC activity. 2′-O-methyl modification of ribose residues have widely been used to site specifically block ribonuclease activity including RISC activity toward RNA targets (Martinez and Tuschl, 2004Martinez J. Tuschl T. RISC is a 5′ phosphomonoester-producing RNA endonuclease.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The effect of 2′-O-methyl inhibition is due to the ability of the methyl group to cause steric hindrance of the Mg2+-based cleavage mechanism (Schwarz et al., 2004Schwarz D.S. Tomari Y. Zamore P.D. The RNA-induced silencing complex is a Mg2+-dependent endonuclease.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 787-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We incorporated this chemical modification on base 9 of the anti-guide RNA. To ensure that the chemically modified RNA would in fact become the anti-guide, rather than the guide RNA, we used an asymmetrical RNA with a bubble A-G mismatch on one end as previously described (Tomari et al., 2004bTomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. A protein sensor for siRNA asymmetry.Science. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar; see Figure 3A for the sequence). No RISC activity against the anti-guide strand’s target was detected (Figure 3C, lanes 1–9), whereas the RISC activity generated by the guiding strand (green strand) was readily detected (Figure 3B, lanes 1–9). As shown in Figure 3B, the 2′-O-methyl modification at position 9 of the anti-guide strand reduced the RISC activity of the guide strand by over 50% (Figure 3B, lanes 1–3 compared to lanes 4–6). When the modification was moved to the neighboring position, base 8 from the 5′ end of the anti-guide strand, activity returned to the level of unmodified siRNA (Figure 3B, lanes 1–3 and 7–9). Similarly, the modification at the 10 position also had full activity (data not shown). This indicates the sensitivity to chemical modification was site specific and the effect was limited only to the predicted Ago2 cleavage site. Though we find it plausible that a chemical modification could also reduce loading in a helicase-dependent mechanism, we think it unlikely that it would do so site specifically. Consistently, compared to an unmodified or 8-modified anti-guide-containing siRNA, the 9 2′-O-methyl modification reduced anti-guide strand cleavage activity as measured by 9-mer production (Figure 3D). It is important to note that 9 modification is does not completely block 9-mer formation. In general, there is a good correlation between the reduction in RISC activity and 9-mer formation resulting from the addition of the 2′-O-methyl modification at the 9 position. As demonstrated in Figures 3B and 3C, the green-labeled strand is exclusively selected as the guide strand of RISC. We checked to see if 9-mer fragments were produced from the guide as well as the anti-guide strand. As shown in Figure 3E, 9-mer was only generated from the anti-guide (lanes 1–4), while the guide produced no detectable 9-mer (lanes 5–8). We directly compared which causes a greater reduction in RISC activity in S2 cell extract—removal of ATP or chemical modification of the anti-guide strand and the results are shown in Figure 4. Unmodified siRNA was loaded in mock-ATP-depleted extract containing 1 mM supplemented ATP, and RISC activity was followed over time (Figure 4, left panel). Similarly, to measure the effect of ATP depletion, we used Hexokinase-treated extracts with unmodified siRNA (Figure 4, middle panel). Finally, the effect of the 9-2′-O-methyl modification in the siRNA anti-guide strand was measured using the RISC assay on mock-ATP-depleted extract containing 1 mM supplemented ATP (Figure 4, right panel). As quantified in Figure 4B, it is apparent that ATP depletion did not affect the initial loading of siRNA or RISC activity. However, over time ATP depletion began to have an effect. On the other hand, the 9-modification’s effect on RISC activity was immediately apparent and remained constant throughout the time course. Because 2′-O-methyl 9 modification of the anti-guide strand of siRNA reduces RISC activation, we attempted to detect an increased interaction between the endogenous nuclease-active Ago2 with modified siRNA. Using the same modification strategy, we synthesized biotinylated unmodified, 9-modified, and 8-modified anti-guide strands. The biotin modification of 3′ hydroxyl group of either the guide or anti-guide strand of siRNA does not affect RISC activity (Martinez et al., 2002Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Urlaub H. Luhrmann R. Tuschl T. Single-stranded antisense siRNAs guide target RNA cleavage in RNAi.Cell. 2002; 110: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar and data not shown). Each of these anti-guide strands was annealed to a nonbiotinylated guide strand. Likewise, we synthesized a biotinylated guide strand, which was annealed to nonbiotinylated unmodified, 9-modified, or 8-modified anti-guide RNAs. Each of the six siRNAs was then added into two types of S2 cell extracts. The first type of extracts contained HisFlagAgo2 as well as the endogenous Ago2 protein. The second type of extracts contained exogenously expressed HisFlag-tagged Ago2 containing a D965A active site mutation (again, in addition to the endogenous Ago2). The D965 position of Drosophila Ago2 is part of a well-conserved GADV motif previously demonstrated to be required for nuclease activity in human Ago2 (Liu et al., 2004Liu J. Carmell M.A. Rivas F.V. Marsden C.G. Thomson J.M. Song J.J. Hammond S.M. Joshua-Tor L. Hannon G.J. Argonaute2 is the catalytic engine of mammalian RNAi.Science. 2004; 305: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 5, when biotinylated guide strand-containing siRNA was used, the endogenous as well as both forms of tagged, recombinant Ago2 got pulled down (lower panels). In contrast, the anti-guide strand pulled down wild-type Ago2 protein (endogenous as well as the HisFlag-tagged recombinant protein) only when it contained a 2′-O-methyl modification at the ninth position (Figure 5, upper right panel, upper and lower band). Unlike wild-type Ago2, the active site mutant Ago2 was found to bind all three anti-guide strands regardless of its modification status (Figure 5, upper left panel, upper band). The above experimental results support a model for how siRNA, generated from long double-stranded RNA by Dicer enzyme, becomes the single-stranded guide of Ago2 nuclease. It seems that both strands of siRNA are loaded onto Ago2 and the anti-guide strand becomes the first substrate of Ago2. The cleavage and subsequent disassociation of the anti-guide strand fragments produces active RISC capable of targeting cognate mRNA for endonucleolytic cleavage. The clue for this model originated from the lack of ATP requirement in siRNA activated RISC activity in S2 cell extracts. We observed almost normal siRNA induced RISC activity in extracts prepared from Drosophila S2 cells in which ATP was depleted to a very low level. This result argued against the requirement for an ATP-dependent helicase that unwinds the two strands of siRNA to form functional RISC. In 2001, Nykanen et al., 2001Nykanen A. Haley B. Zamore P.D. ATP requirements and small interfering RNA structure in the RNA interference pathway.Cell. 2001; 107: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar published a seminal description of the ATP requirements in RNA interference using Drosophila embryo extracts. First, ATP was found to be required for the formation of siRNA from dsRNA. This ATP requirement is also found in S2 cell extracts. Second, ATP was found to be required for siRNA to become single stranded and for RISC activity. In contrast, this requirement appears to be absent from S2 cell extract (Figure 1). One potential reconciliation of this observed difference could be that there is a more prominent phosphatase activity in Drosophila embryonic extracts that rapidly dephosphorylates exogenously add siRNA duplexes (Nykanen et al., 2001Nykanen A. Haley B. Zamore P.D. ATP requirements and small interfering RNA structure in the RNA interference pathway.Cell. 2001; 107: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). In this case, ATP would be necessary to allow the dephosphorylated siRNA to reenter the RNAi pathway via phosphorylation by an endogenous kinase (Nykanen et al., 2001Nykanen A. Haley B. Zamore P.D. ATP requirements and small interfering RNA structure in the RNA interference pathway.Cell. 2001; 107: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 5′ phosphate of siRNA in S2 extracts is rather stable. The small amount of ATP enhancement seen in S2 cell extracts is consistent with a weak phosphatase activity because early on (before the phosphatase has time to dephosphorylate many of the siRNAs) the siRNA population is observed to load normally resulting in full RISC activity (Figure 4B). However, in later time points, dephosphorylated siRNAs might accumulate, thereby dropping the effective concentration of siRNA. ATP would be needed to replenish the siRNA pool through a nucleotide kinase. Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that there is a much more active helicase in the Drosophila embryonic extracts that unwinds siRNAs before they are cleaved by Ago2. In any case, at least in S2 cell extracts, RISC can be activated by siRNA even when ATP was depleted. The ATP independence of RISC activation by siRNA suggested that both strands of siRNA might get passed to Ago2 from D2/R2/siRNA complex without being separated by a helicase. Indeed, using a 3′ biotin-modified siRNA, we detected interaction between both strands of siRNA and Ago2 protein (Figure 5). As predicted, the interaction between the guide strand and Ago2 was readily detected. However, the anti-guide strand and Ago2 interaction was only detected when we used the 2′-O-methyl-modified siRNA at the ninth position or when an active-site mutant Ago2 protein was used. Since in both cases, the cleavage of anti-guide strand is impaired, it seems to us that the cleavage event is important for the anti-guide strand to leave Ago2 and therefore activate RISC to cleave mRNA substrates. If both strands of siRNA get loaded onto Ago2 protein without separation, it is logical that the anti-guide strand will be cleaved by Ago2 endonuclease since it could closely mimic the mRNA substrate, differing only in length. However, direct detection of cleaved products from the anti-guide strand was not possible because of its instability and was only observed w"

Here, we show that the Drosophila nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase enzyme, dual oxidase (dDuox), is indispensable for gut antimicrobial activities. Adult flies in which dDuox expression is silenced showed a marked increase in mortality rate even after a minor infection through ingestion of microbe-contaminated food. This could be restored by the specific reintroduction of dDuox, demonstrating that this oxidase generates a unique epithelial oxidative burst that limits microbial proliferation in the gut. Thus, oxidant-mediated antimicrobial responses are not restricted to the phagocytes, but rather are used more broadly, including in mucosal barrier epithelia."

Inhibition of SIRT1 function in cells without HIC1 abolishes the resistance to apoptosis. Since aging increases promoter hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing of HIC1, we speculate that the resultant upregulation of SIRT1 may be a double-edged sword that both promotes survival of aging cells and increases cancer risk in mammals.

Epigenetic gene silencing can disrupt tumor suppressor gene function as an alternative to inactivating genetic mutations (Jones and Baylin, 2002Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. The fundamental role of epigenetic events in cancer.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 415-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tumor suppressor HIC1, an essential gene for mammalian development (Carter et al., 2000Carter M.G. Johns M.A. Zeng X. Zhou L. Zink M.C. Mankowski J.L. Donovan D.M. Baylin S.B.

Germline disruption of one copy of the gene predisposes mice to an age- and gender-dependent spectrum of malignant tumors in which the wild-type Hic1 allele promoter is hypermethylated (Chen et al., 2003Chen W.Y.

HIC1 synergizes in tumor suppression with p53. Germline disruption of one copy each of Hic1 and p53 on opposite chromosomes (trans) or on the same chromosome (cis) in mice results in an altered spectrum, earlier appearance, increased prevalence, and aggressiveness of tumors (Chen et al., 2004Chen W.Y.

However, how HIC1 functions as a tumor suppressor and how it cooperates with p53 remain unclear. HIC1 encodes a zinc-finger transcriptional factor (Wales et al., 1995Wales M.M. Biel M.A. el Deiry W.

The N-terminal POZ domain is conserved from yeast to human and mediates protein-protein interaction (Bardwell and Treisman, 1994Bardwell V.J. Treisman R.

The second repression domain of HIC1, a central proline-rich region, recruits HDAC1 through an adaptor protein, CtBP, and represses transcription in a TSA-sensitive manner (Deltour et al., 2002Deltour S.

Histone deacetylases are divided into three categories based on their homology to yeast proteins Rpd3p (class I), Hda1p (class II), and Sir2p (class III) (de Ruijter et al., 2003de Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B. Histone deacetylases (HDACs): characterization of the classical HDAC family.Biochem.

Sirtuins: Sir2-related NAD-dependent protein deacetylases.Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). While the class I and II HDACs are generally sensitive to TSA, class III HDACs are not, and the deacetylase activity of class III enzymes relies on the cofactor NAD. The founding member of the class III enzymes, yeast Sir2p, has broad biological functions linking metabolism to transcriptional silencing, suppression of recombination, and chromatin functions (Guarente, 2000Guarente L. Sir2 links chromatin silencing, metabolism, and aging.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1021-1026PubMed Google Scholar). Sir2p is required for yeast life span extension upon calorie restriction (Lin et al., 2000Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Requirement of NAD and SIR2 for life-span extension by calorie restriction in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar), and the reduction of one copy of the Sir2 gene shortens yeast replicative life span, whereas the addition of an extra copy of the Sir2 gene extends life span (Kaeberlein et al., 1999Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. The SIR2/3/4 complex and SIR2 alone promote longevity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by two different mechanisms.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). Similarly, an additional copy of the Sir2 homolog in C. elegans extends its life span (Tissenbaum and Guarente, 2001Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Increased dosage of a sir-2 gene extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2001; 410: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). Small molecules that enhance Sir2 enzymatic activity also prolong life span of yeast and worm (Howitz et al., 2003Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E.

Sirtuin activators mimic caloric restriction and delay ageing in metazoans.Nature. 2004; 430: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar). In mammals there are seven homologs of yeast Sir2p, termed sirtuins, with nuclear protein SIRT1 having the highest homology (reviewed by North and Verdin, 2004North B.J. Verdin E. Sirtuins: Sir2-related NAD-dependent protein deacetylases.Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). SIRT1 levels increase upon calorie restriction or nutrient starvation (Cohen et al., 2004Cohen H.Y. Miller C. Bitterman K.J. Wall N.R. Hekking B. Kessler B. Howitz K.T. Gorospe M. de Cabo R.

Fergusson M.M. Finkel T. Nutrient availability regulates SIRT1 through a forkhead-dependent pathway.Science. 2004; 306: 2105-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). SIRT1 deacetylates nonhistone proteins and allows mammalian cell survival under oxidative stress and DNA damage through at least three mechanisms. First, SIRT1 deacetylates p53 and attenuates its ability to trans-activate its downstream target genes, such as p21 for cell-cycle arrest and Bax for apoptosis (Luo et al., 2001Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W.

Second, SIRT1 deacetylates the DNA damage-repair protein Ku70. The deacetylated form of Ku70 sequesters Bax protein in the cytoplasm and prevents it from translocating to mitochondria to initiate apoptosis (Cohen et al., 2004Cohen H.Y. Miller C. Bitterman K.J.

Calorie restriction promotes mammalian cell survival by inducing the SIRT1 deacetylase.Science. 2004; 305: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). Third, SIRT1 deacetylates FOXO family proteins (Brunet et al., 2004Brunet A. Sweeney L.B. Sturgill J.F. Chua K.F. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Tran H. Ross S.E. Mostoslavsky R.

The involvement of SIRT1 in transcriptional regulation is through deacetylation of histones and non-histone proteins that interact with SIRT1. SIRT1 preferentially deacetylates core histone H3 lysine 9, 14 and H4 lysine 16 in vitro (Imai et al., 2000Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L.

Deacetylation of core histones in vivo by recruitment of SIRT1 to specific promoters results in gene silencing (Senawong et al., 2003Senawong T. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Shepherd D.M. Frye R.A. Minucci S. Leid M. Involvement of the histone deacetylase SIRT1 in chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF)-interacting protein 2-mediated transcriptional repression.J.

Meanwhile, the recruitment of SIRT1 also induces deacetylation of linker histone H1 and further promotes formation of facultative heterochromatin (Vaquero et al., 2004Vaquero A. Scher M. Lee D.

Cell. 2004; 16: 93-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Deacetylation of nonhistone proteins, such as p53, could affect their capability to access local chromatin and thus gene transcription (Luo et al., 2004Luo J. Li M. Tang Y. Laszkowska M. Roeder R.G. Gu W. Acetylation of p53 augments its site-specific DNA binding both in vitro and in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 2259-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Given that HIC1 and p53 functionally cooperate in tumor suppression and that overexpression of p53 trans-activates HIC1 in cancer cells (Guerardel et al., 2001Guerardel C. Deltour S. Pinte S. Monte D. Begue A. Godwin A.K. Leprince D. Identification in the human candidate tumor suppressor gene HIC-1 of a new major alternative TATA-less promoter positively regulated by p53.J. Biol.

Med. 1995; 1: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), we have previously proposed that HIC1 may be involved in a feedback regulation of p53 in the process of tumorigenesis (Chen et al., 2004Chen W.Y. Cooper T.K. Zahnow C.A. Overholtzer M. Zhao Z. Ladanyi M. Karp J.E. Gokgoz N. Wunder J.S. Andrulis I.L. et al.Epigenetic and genetic loss of Hic1 function accentuates the role of p53 in tumorigenesis.Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that HIC1 regulates p53-dependent apoptotic DNA-damage responses. HIC1, via the POZ domain, is complexed with SIRT1, and both HIC1 and SIRT1 bind directly to the promoter of SIRT1 itself and thus control homeostatic SIRT1 expression. This interaction and the transcriptional regulation of SIRT1 appear essential for DNA-damage responses controlled by p53, whose activity is modulated through deacetylation by SIRT1. Therefore, this study provides evidence that the longevity-regulating protein SIRT1 is under the direct control of tumor suppressor HIC1 and that the roles of SIRT1 in regulating cellular responses to DNA damage involve a complex feedback loop encompassing HIC1 and p53. Since heterozygous loss of Hic1 predisposes mice to late-onset tumor development, and aging itself increases promoter hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing of Hic1, we discuss the possibility that resultant upregulation of SIRT1 could both prolong survival of aging cells and also increase the risk of cancer. To study mechanisms underlying HIC1 tumor suppression, we first examined the impact of Hic1 disruption on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). MEF from Hic1−/− mice grew normally and had no significant difference in their karyotypes compared to wild-type MEF (data not shown). However, these cells had a markedly abnormal response to DNA damage. When treated overnight with increasing etoposide concentrations, which induce double-strand DNA breaks, wild-type MEF began to die one to two days after removal of the drug. However, Hic1−/− MEF were about 2-fold more resistant to etoposide treatment (Figure 1A and data not shown). TUNEL assay revealed a striking decrease in apoptotic cells in Hic1−/− as compared to wild-type MEF (Figure 1B), and ratios of apoptotic cells over total DAPI-positive cells were 4.4% (SD = 1.6%) for HIC1−/− and 32.8% (SD = 4.2%) for Hic1+/+ MEF. We next examined whether HIC1 might induce DNA-damage responses in human cancer cells in which endogenous HIC1 is inactivated by promoter hypermethylation. Infection of MCF-7 cells with recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying full-length HIC1 (Ad/HIC1) with a GFP expression cassette produced high levels of HIC1 protein (Figure 1F). Growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells was not affected (not shown). However, after overnight treatment of infected MCF-7 cells with 20 μM etoposide, massive cell death started two days after the drug removal in cells infected with Ad/HIC1 but not Ad/lacZ (Figure 1C); 90% of the cells were dead within four to seven days of etoposide removal, whereas control cells remained healthy (Figures 1C and 1D). The Ad/HIC1-infected cells exhibited a characteristic DNA degradation ladder, indicating apoptosis (Figure 1E). These data suggest that HIC1 can modulate DNA damage-induced apoptosis in both mouse and human cells. Accumulation of phosphorylated histone H2AX is known to occur rapidly at DNA-damage foci as a consequence of the phosphorylation cascade mediated by ATM (Burma et al., 2001Burma S. Chen B.P. Murphy M. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. ATM phosphorylates histone H2AX in response to DNA double-strand breaks.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42462-42467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar, Paull et al., 2000Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. A critical role for histone H2AX in recruitment of repair factors to nuclear foci after DNA damage.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). However, we found that histone H2AX foci formed normally in Hic1−/− MEF and in MCF-7 cells with overexpression of HIC1 (Figure S1), suggesting that HIC1 does not alter initiation of DNA-damage responses. Since p53 is critical for controlling apoptosis (Johnstone et al., 2002Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W. Apoptosis: a link between cancer genetics and chemotherapy.Cell. 2002; 108: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar), we determined whether the above-observed DNA-damage response is p53 dependent. Using RNA interference, we stably knocked down wild-type p53 in MCF-7 cells (Figure 2A ). Upon Ad/HIC1 infection, the pooled p53 knockdown cells appeared more resistant to etoposide treatment than cells transfected with a scrambled control shRNA (Figure 2A). We also isolated individual p53 knockdown clones by limiting dilution and found that six clones with more than 75% knockdown of p53 were more resistant to DNA damage than mock knockdown (Figure 2B), suggesting reliance of HIC1 on p53 for mediating an apoptotic response. Notably, significant cell death still occurred in all six p53 knockdown clones with Ad/HIC1 infection (Figure 2B), either due to residual amounts of p53 or additional pathways being involved. Consistent with the role of p53 in HIC1-mediated apoptosis, overexpression of HIC1 in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, which has a null p53 status, did not confer additional impact on DNA damage-induced apoptosis (Figure 2C). We next searched for potential mechanisms through which HIC1 might mediate p53-dependent DNA-damage control. As mentioned above, the HIC1 N-terminal POZ domain represses transcription in a manner that is resistant to treatment of cells with TSA (Figure 3A ). The TSA-resistant histone deacetylase SIRT1 regulates p53 for stress and DNA-damage response, and we therefore hypothesized that the HIC1 POZ domain might recruit SIRT1 for transcriptional repression. By overexpressing both HIC1 and mouse SIRT1 in COS7 cells, we observed such interaction in that immunoprecipitation of HIC1 with an affinity-purified HIC1 antibody that is specific to a C-terminal peptide of the protein conserved between mouse and human (Chen et al., 2003Chen W.Y. Zeng X. Carter M.G. Morrell C.N. Chiu Yen R.W. Esteller M. Watkins D.N. Herman J.G. Mankowski J.L. Baylin S.B. Heterozygous disruption of Hic1 predisposes mice to a gender-dependent spectrum of malignant tumors.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), coimmunoprecipitated SIRT1 in a manner proportional to the amount of mouse SIRT1 cDNA transfected (Figure 3B). The two endogenous proteins also interact; HIC1 antibody coimmunoprecipitated endogenous SIRT1 from the nuclear extract of NIH 3T3 cells (Figure 3C) and comparison of coprecipitated protein to input suggest that about 0.8% of endogenous SIRT1 protein is associated with HIC1. We then determined whether the Hic1 POZ domain is sufficient to mediate the above interaction. By coexpression in COS-7 cells, HA-tagged fusion protein for the Hic1 POZ domain coimmunoprecipitated with mouse SIRT1 in an HA-POZ dose-dependent manner (Figure 3D), suggesting that the Hic1 POZ domain can, indeed, directly or indirectly interact with SIRT1 in a complex. This interaction has biological significance since a mutant HIC1 construct with POZ-domain truncation, expressed from an adenoviral vector (Ad/ΔPOZ), failed to mediate the apoptotic DNA-damage response as does wild-type HIC1 (Figure 3E). Together, these data suggest that HIC1 recruits SIRT1 through its N-terminal POZ domain and that this interaction is crucial for the biological function of HIC1 in mediating DNA-damage responses. Since Sir2 expression level is critical in influencing life span of yeast and worm (Kaeberlein et al., 1999Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. The SIR2/3/4 complex and SIR2 alone promote longevity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by two different mechanisms.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar, Tissenbaum and Guarente, 2001Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Increased dosage of a sir-2 gene extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2001; 410: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar), homeostatic regulation of this protein would seem essential. We thus sought a role for HIC1 in mediating such homeostasis through direct transcriptional regulation of the SIRT1gene. We first found that both SIRT1 protein (8-fold) and mRNA (2.8-fold) levels were increased significantly in MEF from Hic1−/− mice (Figures 4A and 4B ). These increases are not a nonspecific consequence of Hic1 knockout since SIRT1 levels were not elevated in MEF derived from either mice genetically deleted for lymphoid-specific helicase (LSH or PASG) or INK4a locus (Figure 4A). Loss of LSH/PASG results in mouse growth retardation and premature aging (Sun et al., 2004Sun L.Q. Lee D.W. Zhang Q. Xiao W. Raabe E.H. Meeker A. Miao D. Huso D.L. Arceci R.J. Growth retardation and premature aging phenotypes in mice with disruption of the SNF2-like gene, PASG.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1035-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), while knockout of the INK4a locus allows MEF bypass of senescence and results in malignant tumorigenesis in mice (Serrano et al., 1996Serrano M.

We also found increased Sirt1 expression in primary tumors derived from Hic1+/− mice (Chen et al., 2003Chen W.Y. Zeng X. Carter M.G. Morrell C.N. Chiu Yen R.W. Esteller M. Watkins D.N. Herman J.G.

We found that overexpression of HIC1 suppressed levels of SIRT1 in MCF-7 cells 2-fold, and the mutant HIC1 with POZ domain deletion failed to induce such repression (Figure 4C). To further characterize this repression, we isolated a 2.1 kb SIRT1 promoter fragment spanning −1231 to +900 bp, which contains the entire SIRT1 promoter CpG island and four potential HIC1 binding sites as described in detail below, to drive a luciferase expression cassette. Again, overexpression of wild-type HIC1 resulted in 3-fold reduction of luciferase activity compared to control lacZ, while HIC1 POZ domain deletion nullified the repression (Figure 4D). We next examined whether HIC1 directly represses SIRT1 transcription. Using CAST (cyclic amplification and selection of targets; Wright et al., 1991Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W.

Using a quantitative assay of net serine 845 (Ser-845) phosphorylation in the GluR1 subunit of AMPARs, we investigated the relationship between phospho-Ser-845, GluR1 surface expression, and synaptic strength in hippocampal neurons. About 15% of surface AMPARs in cultured neurons were phosphorylated at Ser-845 basally, whereas chemical potentiation (forskolin/rolipram treatment) persistently increased this to 60% and chemical depression (N-methyl-d-aspartate treatment) decreased it to 10%. These changes in Ser-845 phosphorylation were paralleled by corresponding changes in the surface expression of AMPARs in both cultured neurons and hippocampal slices. For every 1% increase in net phospho-Ser-845, there was 0.75% increase in the surface fraction of GluR1. Phosphorylation of Ser-845 correlated with a selective delivery of AMPARs to extrasynaptic sites, and their synaptic localization required coincident synaptic activity. Furthermore, increasing the extrasynaptic pool of AMPA receptors resulted in stronger theta burst LTP. Our results support a two-step model for delivery of GluR1-containing AMPARs to synapses during activity-dependent LTP, where Ser-845 phosphorylation can traffic AMPARs to extrasynaptic sites for subsequent delivery to synapses during LTP.

Importantly, Ser-845 phosphorylation can also regulate the surface expression of AMPARs by increasing the pool of GluR1 recycled back to the surface after their endocytosis (13Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). CaM-KII activity is also critical for synaptic incorporation of AMPARs but requires a serine at position 845, which is not phosphorylated by CaM-KII, in GluR1 (14Esteban J.A. Shi S.H. Wilson C.

Shi S.H. Wilson C. Nuriya M. Huganir R.L. Malinow R. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), exactly how Ser-845 phosphorylation contributes to trafficking is unclear. Current understanding of the functional role of Ser-845 phosphorylation in GluR1 during synaptic plasticity is limited because previous studies have analyzed only relative changes in phospho-Ser-845. In fact, the functional significance of these changes is determined by the net level of phospho-Ser-845. In this report, we quantified the net Ser-845 phosphorylation and surface expression of GluR1 in hippocampal neurons during bidirectional synaptic plasticity. We observed that receptors phosphorylated at the Ser-845 trafficked specifically to extrasynaptic sites but not to synapses. However, extrasynaptic AMPARs can be incorporated into synapses by synaptic activity. Thus, Ser-845 phosphorylation serves as a “priming” step in enhancing synaptic strength during LTP by enhancing the extrasynaptic delivery of AMPARs. Cultured Hippocampal Neurons and Biochemistry—Hippocampal neurons were cultured from postnatal day 1–2 Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described (15Brewer G.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 71: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 16Atkins C.M. Nozaki N. Shigeri Y. Soderling T.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5193-5201Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and used on 13–15 days in vitro. For chemical stimulations, cultures were first incubated in ACSF for 30 min at room temperature (in mm): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 33 d-glucose, and 25 HEPES (pH 7.3; 320 mosm final), followed by stimulation with 50 μm forskolin (Sigma) and 0.1 μm rolipram (Calbiochem) in ACSF (no MgCl2) or 50 μm NMDA. After 10 min of stimulation, neurons were replaced in regular ACSF and then subjected to surface biotinylation at indicated time points. Surface Biotinylation—After F/R or NMDA stimulations, cultured neurons or slices were transferred to ice-cold ASCF for 2 min, followed by biotinylation in 1 mg/ml of biotin (EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin; Pierce) for 20 or 45 min with slow agitation for cultured neurons or slices, respectively. This results in complete biotinylation throughout 400-μm hippocampal slices (17Thomas-Crusells J. Vieira A. Saarma M. Rivera C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2003; 125: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After three rinses in cold Tris-based ACSF (HEPES replaced with Tris) to quench free biotin, slices were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cultures were immediately scraped without freezing in cold 1% Triton X-100 homogenization buffer (150 μl/35-mm well) (in mm: 50 NaCl, 10 EDTA, 10 EGTA, 1 Na3VO4, 50 NaF, 25 NaPPi, 1 β-glycerophosphate, 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.001 microcystine, 1× protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science), 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture set I (Calbiochem), and 50 HEPES (pH 7.5). Solubilization was performed in 1% Triton X-100 because this protocol does not solubilize postsynaptic densities (36Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and is therefore selective for extrasynaptic AMPARs. Two frozen slices were pooled for each condition and homogenized in 150 μl of cold 1% Triton X-100 homogenization buffer. An additional 150 μl of homogenization buffer was added to obtain 300 μl of total slice homogenate. Homogenates from cultures (2 wells per condition) and slices were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to pellet the insoluble fraction. For the total fraction of GluR1 (surface plus internal), 75 μl of the supernatant was mixed and heated with 25 μl of 6× SDS sample buffer. Biotinylated surface proteins in the remaining supernatant (∼225 μl) were immunoprecipitated with 40 μl of 50% avidin-agarose beads (ImmunoPure Immobilized Avidin; Pierce) for >2 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted, and 75 μl of the supernatant (internal fraction) was mixed and heated with 25 μl of 6× SDS sample buffer. The beads were then rinsed three times with 1% Triton X-100 homogenization buffer and heated in 100 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (surface fraction). Equal volumes of the total and internal fractions were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, probed for total GluR1, and normalized to tubulin. The surface fraction was calculated as the following: surface = 1 – (internal/total). Quantitative Western Blotting—Primary antibodies were: anti-phospho-Ser-831-GluR1 (UBI), anti-phospho-Ser-845-GluR1 (UBI and Chemicon), anti-GluR1 (UBI), and anti-tubulin (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). All surface GluR1 obtained from cultured neurons and slices were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE with a set of calibration samples (at least 5/gel) on the same and every blot for net quantitation of phospho-Ser-845 (Fig. 2a). Calibration samples were prepared by phosphorylating a GST-fused consensus phosphorylation sequence (CPS) mutant for PKA (P842R) (10 μm) with PKA (100 nm) in vitro for 30 min at 30 °C in phosphorylation buffer (Fig. 1d). This fully phosphorylated Ser-845 GluR1 was mixed with specific amounts of non-phosphorylated proteins (10 μm) to obtain 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% phosphorylated calibration samples. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted using infrared dye-coupled secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 680, anti-mouse IgG IRdye800; Rockland). Image acquisition and data quantitation were performed on the Odyssey Infrared Imaging system (Li-Cor). Preliminary blots were run to normalize for the differences in GluR1 amount between biotinylated GluR1 and calibration samples. Calibration curves were calculated by determining the fraction of phospho-Ser-845 signals over total GluR1 signals and then plotting this fraction against percentage of phospho-Ser-845 of calibration standards. Only linear curves with R2 >0.90 were used for analysis (Fig. 2a).FIGURE 1In vitro CaM-KII and PKA phosphorylation of GST-GluR1 C terminus. a, CaM-KII (10 nm) phosphorylated wild-type GluR1 (10 μm) to a molar stoichiometry of ∼1, and this was completely blocked by S831A mutation. b, PKA (10 nm) did not phosphorylate wild-type GluR1, but mutating Ser-845 into consensus phosphorylation site for PKA (P842R) allowed robust phosphorylation (d), whereas a similar mutation at the CaM-KII site (P828R) had no effect (c). Panels a–d, n = 4. e, amino acid sequence around the two phosphorylation sites revealed that neither Ser-831 nor Ser-845 sites are consensus phosphorylation sequences for CaM-KII or PKA, respectively, with a proline rather than an arginine at the p-3 position. f, Western blot analysis using phospho-specific and total GluR1 antibodies of in vitro CaM-KII and PKA phosphorylated GST-GluR1-CTs gave similar results as 32P incorporation assays (a–d).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Electrophysiology and Biochemistry of Hippocampal Slices—Acute hippocampal slices were prepared and recorded from 4–6-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described (18Schmitt J.M.

Recordings were digitized at 100 kHz, and initial linear slopes of fEPSPs were analyzed. Basal stimulation was induced every min, and recordings were averaged to 3-min bins for analysis. Control and test conditions were interleaved within each animal to control for differences between animals. After 20 min of stable baseline, 25 μm forskolin and 0.1 μm rolipram (no MgCl2) were added in slice recording buffer for 10 min with or without basal stimulation. Theta burst stimulation protocols were used as described (18Schmitt J.M. Guire E.S. Saneyoshi T. Soderling T.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).

For Chem-LTD experiments (Fig. 2, b and c), F/R stimulations were immediately followed by 3 min of 25 μm NMDA. Slices were replaced in regular slice recording buffer after stimulation and then subjected to surface biotinylation without microdissection at indicated time points.

This was accomplished by in vitro phosphorylation of purified GST fusions of the C-terminal 75 residues of GluR1 (GST-GluR1-CT) with purified protein kinases (11Barria A. Derkach V. Soderling T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32727-32730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Using [γ-32P]ATP, CaM-KII (10 nm) catalyzed phosphorylation of Ser-831 to a molar stoichiometry of ∼1 (Fig. 1a). Surprisingly, PKA (10–200 nm) gave a stoichiometry of <0.1 for Ser-845 (Fig. 1b). Examination of the sequence around both Ser-831 and Ser-845 revealed that neither is a CPS for CaM-KII or PKA, respectively, since neither contains an arginine in the p-3 position (Fig. 1e). Therefore, the CPS GST-GluR1-CT fusion mutants P828R and P842R were expressed, purified, and examined for phosphorylation. CaM-KII phosphorylated the P828R mutant the same as wild-type (Fig. 1c), but now PKA catalyzed stoichiometric phosphorylation of the CPS P842R mutant (Fig. 1d). The results obtained by 32P incorporation were verified using phospho-specific antibodies for Ser-831 and Ser-845 (Fig. 1f). The CPS mutant P842R was stoichiometrically phosphorylated by PKA on Ser-845 and mixed with known amounts of non-phosphorylated GST-GluR1-CT to make calibrations standards. These in vitro phospho-Ser-845 calibration standards were run on every SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2a) with extracts of cultured neurons or hippocampal slices and used for Western blotting with phospho-specific antibody to quantify the net Ser-845 phosphorylation levels of endogenous GluR1 in cultured hippocampal neurons. To induce Ser-845 phosphorylation (12Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), we used a recently described chemical stimulation protocol of forskolin plus rolipram (F/R) that results in prolonged NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent LTP (cLTP) (20Otmakhov N. Khibnik L. Otmakhova N. Carpenter S. Riahi S. Asrican B. Lisman J. J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and recruits CaM-KII to dendritic spines (21Otmakhov N. Tao-Cheng J.H. Carpenter S. Asrican B. Dosemeci A. Reese T.S. Lisman J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9324-9331Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Treatment of hippocampal cultures with F/R (50 μm/0.1 μm) for 10 min persistently increased basal Ser-845 phosphorylation (10–20%) of surface GluR1 to ∼60% at 30–40 min (Fig. 2b), which correlated with a significant increase in surface expression of GluR1 (Fig. 2c). Importantly, there was no net increase in Ser-831 phosphorylation during this same time period (Fig. 2e), suggesting that Ser-845 phosphorylation may play a specific role in GluR1 trafficking (13Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 14Esteban J.A. Shi S.H. Wilson C. Nuriya M. Huganir R.L. Malinow R. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The Ser-845 phosphorylation stoichiometry did not differ between the surface and total GluR1 fractions (data not shown). Neither Ser-845 phosphorylation nor surface GluR1 delivery was blocked by the NMDAR antagonist d-2 amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (d-APV) (Fig. 2, b and c) or tetrodotoxin (data not shown). The plot of net phospho-Ser-845 versus normalized surface GluR1 yielded a linear relationship with an R2 value of 0.997 and slope of 0.75 (Fig. 2d). This tight relationship strongly implicates GluR1 Ser-845 phosphorylation in regulating surface expression of AMPARs. Dephosphorylation of Ser-845 Is Associated with a Decrease in Surface GluR1—Bath application of NMDA induces chemical LTD (Chem-LTD) and Ser-845 dephosphorylation in hippocampal slices (22Kameyama K. Lee H.K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1163-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 23Lee H.K. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. Bear M.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1151-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that blocking Ser-845 phosphorylation during F/R stimulation may also block the surface delivery of new AMPARs. Bath application of NMDA (50 μm) to cultured hippocampal neurons resulted in a significant Ser-845 dephosphorylation of surface GluR1 and also prevented subsequent F/R-mediated Ser-845 phosphorylation (Fig. 3a). Importantly, the decrease in phospho-Ser-845 was associated with a decrease in the surface pool of GluR1 (Fig. 3b). These results suggest that the fraction of GluR1 delivered to the surface was closely correlated with net phospho-Ser-845 (13Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Ser-845-phosphorylated AMPARs Are Trafficked to Extrasynaptic Sites in Hippocampal Slices—The functional role of GluR1 Ser-845 phosphorylation was further investigated in acute hippocampal slices by testing whether F/R increases phospho-Ser-845, surface GluR1, and synaptic strength. Surface GluR1 was measured by biotinylation using conditions previously shown to penetrate the entire slice (17Thomas-Crusells J. Vieira A. Saarma M. Rivera C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2003; 125: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Similar percentages of AMPARs (∼30–35%) were found on the surface in both slices and cultured neurons, indicating that biotinylation was equally effective in these preparations (data not shown). A 10-min F/R (25 μm/0.1 μm) stimulation resulted in a robust Ser-845 phosphorylation from a basal value of 15 to ∼50% that persisted for at least 1 h after the washout of drugs (Fig. 4a) that was associated with a significant increase in surface GluR1 fraction (Fig. 4c). Bath treatment with 25 μm NMDA for 3 min induced Chem-LTD (65 min after NMDA treatment, normalized fEPSP slope: Control = 0.94 ± 0.4, n = 6; NMDA = 0.75 ± 0.5, n = 12; p <0.05) (19Atkins C.M. Davare M.A. Oh M.C. Derkach V. Soderling T.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5604-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and completely blocked F/R-mediated Ser-845 phosphorylation (Fig. 4b) and surface delivery of GluR1 (Fig. 4c). Thus, pharmacological stimulations that either increased (F/R) or decreased (NMDA) net phospho-Ser-845 significantly increased or decreased the surface pool of GluR1, respectively, supporting the hypothesis that Ser-845 phosphorylation is involved in regulating the size of surface pool of GluR1 in hippocampal slices. We evaluated the functional effect of GluR1 Ser-845 phosphorylation on synaptic strength by recording fEPSPs from the CA1 region of hippocampal slices. After 20 min of stable baseline, basal stimulation was stopped and F/R was applied to slices for 10 min, followed by basal stimulation 40 min later to assess changes in synaptic strength. The 40-min pause was chosen to allow surface GluR1 phospho-Ser-845 to increase to almost 50% (Fig. 4, a and b). When basal stimulation was resumed, synaptic strength in F/R treated slices was comparable with the control (Me2SO) (Fig. 5a, closed diamonds and open circles, respectively). This was surprising because the increase in surface GluR1 phospho-Ser-845 (Fig. 5b) should increase surface AMPARs (Fig. 4c), thereby enhancing synaptic strength. There was also no detectable presynaptic effect, as the pair-pulse facilitation (PPF) ratio remained at 1.5 during baseline and 40 min after F/R treatment (data not shown). These findings revealed that in the absence of basal stimulation, F/R treatment was sufficient to robustly increase surface AMPA receptors (Fig. 4c) but not synaptic strength (Fig. 5a), indicating that AMPA receptors phosphorylated at Ser-845 were probably trafficked to extrasynaptic sites. Ser-845 Phosphorylation Primes GluR1 for Synaptic Incorporation—What additional signal is required to drive the extrasynaptic receptors into synapses? When F/R was applied with basal synaptic stimulation, the synaptic responses were dramatically increased, resulting in cLTP (20Otmakhov N. Khibnik L. Otmakhova N. Carpenter S. Riahi S. Asrican B. Lisman J. J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) that persisted for over 1 h (Fig. 5a, open squares). As shown previously, cLTP required concurrent synaptic activity, involving NMDARs (20Otmakhov N. Khibnik L. Otmakhova N. Carpenter S. Riahi S. Asrican B. Lisman J. J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Based on our finding that synaptic activity is not required for surface expression of AMPARs in response to F/R, we hypothesized that Ser-845 phosphorylation primed AMPARs for synaptic potentiation by trafficking them to extrasynaptic sites, possibly followed by synaptic incorporation requiring synaptic activity. Can extrasynaptic AMPARs regulate synaptic strength during activity-evoked plasticity? To test this hypothesis, we primed hippocampal slices with F/R treatment in the absence of basal stimulation to increase extrasynaptic AMPARs, followed by theta burst stimulation to induce electrical LTP. Indeed, three theta trains resulted in significantly larger LTP in slices pretreated with F/R (1.63-fold over baseline, p <0.05) compared with control slices (1.34-fold over baseline) (Fig. 5c). In this and subsequent experiments, pair-pulse facilitation ratios were not significantly different between F/R ± NMDA and control groups (data not shown), suggesting a predominantly postsynaptic locus of expression under these conditions. Furthermore, CA1 regions microdissected after recordings had significantly elevated phospho-Ser-845 in slices pretreated with F/R compared with controls (Fig. 5d). These results support the hypothesis that GluR1 Ser-845 phosphorylation increases the number of AMPARs available for synaptic incorporation (14Esteban J.A. Shi S.H. Wilson C. Nuriya M. Huganir R.L. Malinow R. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) by increasing the extrasynaptic surface pool. Blocking Ser-845 Phosphorylation Prevents Priming of AMPARs for Synaptic Incorporation—If Ser-845 phosphorylation is important for regulating the surface pool of extrasynaptic AMPARs, then blocking Ser-845 phosphorylation should also prevent priming of AMPARs and the corresponding enhancement of LTP observed in Fig. 5c. We tested this hypothesis by using a Chem-LTD paradigm (3-min bath application of 25 μm NMDA) that alone resulted in basal dephosphorylation of Ser-845 (Figs. 1e and 2b) and decreased the surface pool of GluR1 (Figs. 1f and 2c) (28Ashby M.C. De La Rue S.A. Ralph G.S. Uney J. Collingridge G.L. Henley J.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We anticipated that NMDA treatment may block F/R-mediated Ser-845 phosphorylation and thus the priming of LTP. Indeed, application of NMDA after F/R treatment significantly suppressed Ser-845 phosphorylation from 46% (Fig. 5d) in slices treated with F/R alone to 19% (Fig. 5f) when F/R was followed by NMDA (p <0.001). This NMDA treatment also completely blocked F/R-induced cLTP in the presence of basal stimulation (data not shown). More importantly, NMDA treatment completely blocked the priming effect of F/R on theta burst LTP (Fig. 5e). These results suggest that GluR1 Ser-845 phosphorylation plays an important role in modulating the dynamic range of LTP amplitude by regulating the amount of extrasynaptic AMPARs available for synaptic incorporation (Fig. 5g). The major finding of this study was that GluR1 Ser-845 phosphorylation primes AMPARs for synaptic incorporation by trafficking AMPARs to extrasynaptic sites on the surface membrane. Previous studies (3Banke T.G. Bowie D. Lee H. Huganir R.L. Schousboe A. Traynelis S.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 89-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Esteban J.A. Shi S.H. Wilson C. Nuriya M. Huganir R.L. Malinow R. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 24Lee H.K. Barbarosie M. Kameyama K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) examined Ser-845 phosphorylation in GluR1 upon various stimulation paradigms, but only relative changes were analyzed, making it difficult to interpret the likely physiological significance of these changes. This report is the first investigation to quantify the net phosphorylation state of Ser-845 in endogenous hippocampal GluR1 during chemically induced bidirectional synaptic plasticity. This allowed analyses of functional effects in changes of net phospho-Ser-845 and surface GluR1 delivery during bidirectional synaptic plasticity by combining quantitative immunoblotting, surface biotinylation, and slice field recordings. Under basal conditions ∼30 –35% of GluR1 was on the surface membrane, and only 15% was phosphorylated at Ser-845. Induction of cLTP, in the absence of electrical stimulation, increased surface expression and Ser-845 phosphorylation without affecting Ser-831 phosphorylation, whereas Chem-LTD decreased surface expression and Ser-845 phosphorylation. Combined with a functional analysis of synaptic responses, we demonstrated that Ser-845 phosphorylation-regulated surface GluR1 delivery was to extrasynaptic sites. Results from this study indicate that Ser-845 phosphorylation can modulate the dynamic range of synaptic plasticity by regulating the pool of AMPARs available for synaptic incorporation. Thus, Ser-845 phosphorylation might be one of several mechanisms that neurons may use to regulate the amplitude of synaptic potentiation. Although there are likely other mechanisms for GluR1 delivery to the surface membrane during synaptic plasticity, the critical role of Ser-845 phosphorylation is in the enrichment of extrasynaptic AMPARs by shifting the equilibrium between the surface and internal pools of AMPARs. It is interesting that F/R treatment gave equivalent increases in Ser-845 phosphorylation of surface and total GluR1. A possible model to explain this observation is that in the absence of Ser-845 phosphorylation the equilibrium between surface and internal AMPARs strongly favors the internal pool (i.e. endocytosis). Upon Ser-845 phosphorylation, this equilibrium between surface insertion and endocytosis changes (13Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar), such that approximately equal numbers of AMPAR may cycle between the surface and internal pools. Thus, F/R treatment could increase the pool of total Ser-845-phosphorylated AMPAR, thereby favoring surface expression by mass action. Another essential finding of our study was that the surface delivery of AMPARs can be dissociated from synaptic targeting that required concomitant synaptic activity (Fig. 5a), suggesting that synaptic NMDAR activation is required (20Otmakhov N. Khibnik L. Otmakhova N. Carpenter S. Riahi S. Asrican B. Lisman J. J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Ser-845 phosphorylation has previously been proposed to be important for regulating the amount of GluR1-containing AMPARs available for synaptic incorporation, whereas CaM-KII activity appears to be critical for synaptic incorporation (14Esteban J.A. Shi S.H. Wilson C. Nuriya M. Huganir R.L. Malinow R. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Our results provide a specific mechanism for this previous finding; Ser-845 phosphorylation-dependent delivery is selective to extrasynaptic sites. The increase in extrasynaptic pool of GluR1 resulted in larger LTP following triple theta burst stimulation (Fig. 5c), suggesting that synaptic NMDAR activity can drive GluR1-containing AMPARs into synapses from the extrasynaptic pools. This priming effect was suppressed by Chem-LTD, which blocked the F/R-mediated increase in phospho-Ser-845 and surface GluR1 (Fig. 3) (25Snyder E.M. Colledge M. Crozier R.A. Chen W.S. Scott J.D. Bear M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar). Therefore, our results support a two-step model for synaptic delivery of AMPARs (Fig. 5g), where GluR1-containing AMPARs are first delivered to the extrasynaptic sites in a Ser-845 phosphorylation-regulated manner. Activated synaptic NMDARs then cause an influx of calcium that likely triggers the signal transduction cascades necessary for anchoring AMPARs in synapses. Thus, Ser-845 phosphorylation primes the GluR1-containing AMPARs for synaptic incorporation. The two-step model for synaptic delivery of AMPARs (Fig. 5g) is consistent with reports from other laboratories. For example, studies show that extrasynaptic AMPARs in hippocampal dendrites are increased nearly 2-fold during LTP (26Andrasfalvy B.K. Magee J.C. J. Physiol. 2004; 559: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and extrasynaptic AMPARs are significantly depleted in GluR1 knock-out mice (27Andrasfalvy B.K. Smith M.A. Borchardt T. Sprengel R. Magee J.C. J. Physiol. 2003; 552: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent data show that removal of GluR2-containing AMPARs also occurs first at extrasynaptic sites, immediately followed by a decrease in synaptic AMPARs (28Ashby M.C. De La Rue S.A. Ralph G.S. Uney J. Collingridge G.L. Henley J.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). AMPARs have been shown to rapidly move in and out of synapses via lateral movement along the surface membrane, which may account for the increase in postsynaptic AMPAR responses during LTP (29Groc L. Heine M. Cognet L. Brickley K. Stephenson F.A. Lounis B. Choquet D. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 30Borgdorff A.J. Choquet D. Nature. 2002; 417: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 31Tardin C. Cognet L. Bats C. Lounis B. Choquet D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4656-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 32Triller A. Choquet D. Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 133-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Elevating local intracellular calcium causes accumulation of AMPARs on the surface membrane, suggesting that calcium triggers the mechanism for synaptic anchoring of laterally diffusing AMPARs (30Borgdorff A.J. Choquet D. Nature. 2002; 417: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 31Tardin C. Cognet L. Bats C. Lounis B. Choquet D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4656-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Whether calcium first increases the number of anchors at synapses or blocks the lateral diffusion of AMPARs, which then recruit the anchors, remains to be determined. Because AMPARs diffuse freely in extrasynaptic sites (31Tardin C. Cognet L. Bats C. Lounis B. Choquet D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4656-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), it seems more likely that synaptic calcium recruits more anchors to postsynaptic densities, which then sequester laterally diffusing AMPARs. One potential component of this anchor might be postsynaptic density-95, which has been shown to be important for regulating the number of synaptic AMPARs (33Ehrlich I. Malinow R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 916-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 34El-Husseini A.E. Schnell E. Chetkovich D.M. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1364-1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Stein V. House D.R. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5503-5506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data do not exclude that AMPARs can be incorporated into synapses directly from the cytoplasm but do indicate that extrasynaptic AMPARs are important contributors to synaptic plasticity. An important regulator of AMPAR trafficking is stargazin, which has been shown to be critical for the delivery of AMPARs to the surface membrane (36Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Importantly, overexpression of stargazin significantly increases AMPA-mediated currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons but not their synaptic currents (36Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), mirroring present findings with F/R treatment and leading to similar conclusions on stargazin-mediated delivery of AMPARs selectively to extrasynaptic sites. Alternatively, direct regulation of AMPA receptor function by stargazin (37Tomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K. Howe J.R. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Nature. 2005; 435: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 38Turetsky D. Garringer E. Patneau D.K. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7438-7448Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) is also consistent with its potentiating effects. However, our data showed unambiguously, using surface biotinylation, that AMPARs can be trafficked to extrasynaptic sites. Interestingly, postsynaptic density-95 overexpression results in synaptic potentiation of AMPARs (33Ehrlich I. Malinow R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 916-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 39Schnell E. Sizemore M. Karimzadegan S. Chen L. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13902-13907Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). What might be the Ca2+-sensitive transducer that promotes anchoring of AMPARs at synapses? CaM-KII has been implicated in inserting AMPARs into synapses (7Hayashi Y. Shi S.H. Esteban J.A. Piccini A. Poncer J.C. Malinow R. Science. 2000; 287: 2262-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 14Esteban J.A. Shi S.H. Wilson C. Nuriya M. Huganir R.L. Malinow R. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), and F/R stimulation is known to recruit CaM-KII to dendritic spines (21Otmakhov N. Tao-Cheng J.H. Carpenter S. Asrican B. Dosemeci A. Reese T.S. Lisman J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9324-9331Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Thus, calcium influx through synaptic NMDARs can activate CaM-KII (40Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar), which may then drive extrasynaptic AMPARs into synapses. The exact target of CaM-KII important for this delivery is unknown, as it does not appear to be Ser-831 in GluR1 (7Hayashi Y. Shi S.H. Esteban J.A. Piccini A. Poncer J.C. Malinow R. Science. 2000; 287: 2262-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, stargazin has multiple phosphorylation sites, including CaM-KII and PKC sites that appear to be involved in regulating AMPAR trafficking (37Tomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K. Howe J.R. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Nature. 2005; 435: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Clearly, additional studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of synaptic capture of AMPARs."

This Hox regulatory network directs the downstream transcriptional identity of motor neuron pools and defines the pattern of target-muscle connectivity."

https://openalex.org/W2145345398,"The Myc oncoprotein forms a binary activating complex with its partner protein, Max, and a ternary repressive complex that, in addition to Max, contains the zinc finger protein Miz1. Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase HectH9 ubiquitinates Myc in vivo and in vitro, forming a lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chain. Miz1 inhibits this ubiquitination. HectH9-mediated ubiquitination of Myc is required for transactivation of multiple target genes, recruitment of the coactivator p300, and induction of cell proliferation by Myc. HectH9 is overexpressed in multiple human tumors and is essential for proliferation of a subset of tumor cells. Our results suggest that site-specific ubiquitination regulates the switch between an activating and a repressive state of the Myc protein, and they suggest a strategy to interfere with Myc function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2018554421,"In mammalian excitatory neurons, dendritic spines are separated from dendrites by thin necks. Diffusion across the neck limits the chemical and electrical isolation of each spine. We found that spine/dendrite diffusional coupling is heterogeneous and uncovered a class of diffusionally isolated spines. The barrier to diffusion posed by the neck and the number of diffusionally isolated spines is bidirectionally regulated by neuronal activity. Furthermore, coincident synaptic activation and postsynaptic action potentials rapidly restrict diffusion across the neck. The regulation of diffusional coupling provides a possible mechanism for determining the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials and the accumulation of plasticity-inducing molecules within the spine head."

Mice with a null mutation of P2X7R have osteopenia in load bearing bones, suggesting that the P2X7R may be involved in the skeletal response to mechanical loading. We found the skeletal sensitivity to mechanical loading was reduced by up to 73% in P2X7R null (knock-out (KO)) mice. Release of ATP in the primary calvarial osteoblasts occurred within 1 min of onset of fluid shear stress (FSS). After 30 min of FSS, P2X7R-mediated pore formation was observed in wild type (WT) cells but not in KO cells. FSS increased prostaglandin (PG) E2 release in WT cells but did not alter PGE2 release in KO cells. Studies using MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and MLO-Y4 osteocytes confirmed that PGE2 release was suppressed by P2X7R blockade, whereas the P2X7R agonist BzATP enhanced PGE2 release.

After 30 min of FSS, P2X7R-mediated pore formation was observed in wild type (WT) cells but not in KO cells. FSS increased prostaglandin (PG) E2 release in WT cells but did not alter PGE2 release in KO cells. Studies using MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and MLO-Y4 osteocytes confirmed that PGE2 release was suppressed by P2X7R blockade, whereas the P2X7R agonist BzATP enhanced PGE2 release. We conclude that ATP signaling through P2X7R is necessary for mechanically induced release of prostaglandins by bone cells and subsequent osteogenesis. Mechanical loads applied to bone tissue increase bone formation and improves bone strength (1Robling A.G. Hinant F.M. Burr D.B. Turner C.H. J. Bone Miner Res. 2002; 17: 1545-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar).

Numerous cell culture studies have demonstrated an increased production of PGs in osteoblasts and osteocytes subjected to fluid shear stresses (for review, see Ref. 6Chow J.W. Exerc. Sport Sci. Rev. 2000; 28: 185-188PubMed Google Scholar). Several PGs have independent anabolic effects on bone tissue. In particular PGE2 greatly enhances the synthetic activities of osteoblasts (7Jee W.S.

Both osteoblasts and osteoclasts express several types of P2 receptors (for review, see Ref. 14Bowler W.B. Buckley K.A. Gartland A. Hipskind R.A. Bilbe G. Gallagher J.A. Bone. 2001; 28: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Activation of P2 receptors in bone cells by ATP has been shown to increase [Ca2+]i (15Jorgensen N.R. Geist S.T. Civitelli R.

Based on their molecular structure and activated signal pathways, P2 purinergic receptors are divided into two classes: P2X and P2Y (21North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). The P2X receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that, in general, are nonselective for monovalent cations. However, some of these receptors are also permeable to Ca2+ or even anions. P2Y receptors are G protein-linked receptors that in many cases are coupled through phospholipase C to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Seven P2X subtypes and six P2Y subtypes have been identified in mammalian cells (22Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) appears to be the most divergent member among P2X family. P2X7Rs have the unique ability to form large aqueous pores in the membrane, permeable to hydrophilic molecules as large as 900 Da with prolonged exposure to agonists (21North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). Activation of P2X7Rs stimulates the release of the inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β in immune cells (23Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar). P2X7R activation also results in cell membrane blebbing (24Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Dal Susino M. Melchiorri L. Baricordi O.R. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1451-1458PubMed Google Scholar) and changes in cellular morphology, which eventually leads to cell death by both necrotic and apoptotic mechanisms (25Ferrari D. Los M. Bauer M.K. Vandenabeele P. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The P2X7R forms a complex with several proteins including β2 integrin, receptor-like tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP), α-actinin, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, membrane-associated guanylate kinase, and several heat shock proteins (26Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Several of these proteins are associated with mechanotransduction. For instance, RPTP is involved in force-dependent formation of focal adhesion complexes (27von Wichert G. Jiang G. Kostic A. De Vos K. Sap J. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and α-actinin links β integrins with the actin cytoskeleton promoting transduction of mechanical forces (28Pavalko F.M. Chen N.X. Turner C.H. Burr D.B. Atkinson S. Hsieh Y.F. Qiu J. Duncan R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1591-C1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, mice with a null mutation of the P2X7R were shown to have reduced total bone mineral content, smaller periosteal circumference in the femur, increased trabecular bone resorption, and reduced periosteal bone formation (29Ke H.Z. Qi H. Weidema A.F. Zhang Q. Panupinthu N. Crawford D.T. Grasser W.A. Paralkar V.M. Li M. Audoly L.P. Gabel C.A. Jee W.S. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. Thompson D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1356-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This phenotype of suppressed periosteal bone formation coupled with increased trabecular bone resorption resembles the effects of disuse on the skeleton. When a weight-bearing limb is placed in disuse, e.g. with a plaster cast, periosteal bone formation is suppressed and trabecular bone resorption increases (30Uhthoff H.K. Jaworski Z.F. J. Bone Joint Surg. Br. 1978; 60-B: 420-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the nature of the protein complex interacting with P2X7R and the observation that P2X7R null mice resemble the skeletal disuse phenotype, we hypothesized that the P2X7R may be necessary for the proper skeletal response to mechanical loading. To answer the question whether mice lacking the P2X7R have decreased skeletal sensitivity to mechanical loading, we measured the skeletal response to loading in P2X7R knock-out (KO) mice. To further study the role of P2X7R in the osteoblastic response to mechanical loading, calvarial cells isolated from newborn KO and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to a steady laminar fluid flow (FSS). We found that 30 min FSS increased the cellular uptake of 4-[(3-methyl-2(3H)-benzoxazolylidene)methyl]-1[3-(trimethylammonio)propyl]iodide (YO-PRO-1) (molecular mass = 630 daltons) mediated by P2X7R mediated pore formation in WT cells but not in KO cells. Application of FSS for 15–60 min significantly increased PGE2 release in WT cells but not in KO cells. In addition, we demonstrated that mechanical signals induced ATP signaling in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and MLO-Y4 osteocytes and that ATP activation of P2X7 is necessary for the subsequent release of PGE2. Animals—The P2X7R KO mouse was generated as reported by Solle et al. (31Solle M. Labasi J. Perregaux D.G. Stam E. Petrushova N. Koller B.H. Griffiths R.J. Gabel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 125-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). The P2X R KO (P2X7R–/–) mice as well as the WT (P2X7R+/+) mice (C57BL/6) were purchased from Taconic (Germantown, NY) at 4–5 weeks of age. The animals were housed at Indiana University School of Medicine Animal Care Facility for 13–14 weeks (acclimation period) before the experiment began. All animals were allowed free access to standard mouse chow and water during the whole experimental period. All procedures performed were in accordance with the Indiana University Animal Care and Use Committee Guidelines. In Situ Mechanical Properties of the Ulna and Radius—When the animals reached 18 weeks of age, five mice from male and female WT and KO mice were chosen at random, anesthetized and killed by cervical dislocation. Immediately after killing, each animal was weighed, and the forearm was tested using a miniature materials testing machine (Vitrodyne V1000; Liveco, Inc., Burlington, VT), which has a force resolution of 0.05 newton. The right arm was minimally dissected to expose the medial surface of the midshaft ulna. A single element strain gauge (model EA-06–015DJ-120; Measurements Group, Inc., Raleigh, NC) was fixed to the exposed medial ulnar surface with cyanoacrylete (M-Bond 200; Measurements Group, Inc.) at a point 3.35 mm distal to the brachialis insertion based on the previous report in our laboratory (32Robling A.G. Turner C.H. Bone. 2002; 31: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Once fitted with a strain gauge, the voltage was zeroed, and the forearm was loaded in cyclic axial compression using an electromagnetic actuator with force feedback control. Using a 2-Hz haversine waveform, the forearms were laded at 0.95, 1.40, 1.85, and 2.3 newtons, during which peak-to-peak voltage was measured on a digital oscilloscope. Voltage measurements were converted to strain as reported previously (32Robling A.G. Turner C.H. Bone. 2002; 31: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In Vivo Ulnar Loading—Animals in each gender WT or KO mice were subdivided randomly into 3 groups for in vivo loading: low magnitude, medium magnitude, or high magnitude loading groups. Under anesthesia with inhalation of isoflurane (2%), the right forearm of each mouse was loaded at 120 cycles per day for 3 consecutive days with a 2-Hz haversine waveform using the electromagnetic actuator. The left forearms were not loaded and served as an internal control for loading effects. All mice were allowed normal cage activity between loading sessions and afterward. Intraperitoneal injections of calcein (30 mg/kg body weight; Sigma) and alizarin (50 mg/kg body weight; Sigma) were administered 5 and 11 days after the first loading day. All animals were killed 18 days after the first loading day. Tissue Processing, Histomorphometry, and Ulnar Strain Calculations—Right and left ulnae were processed as reported previously (32Robling A.G. Turner C.H. Bone. 2002; 31: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Transverse thick sections (70 μm) were cut at the ulnar midshaft and further ground to a final thickness of 20 μm and then mounted unstained on microscope slides. One section per limb was read on a Nikon Optiphot flurescence microscope (Nikon, Inc., Garden City, NJ) using the Bioquant digitizing system (R&M Biometrics, Nashville, TN). The following primary data were collected from the periosteal surface at ×250 magnification: total perimeter (B.Pm); single label perimeter (sL.Pm); double label perimeter (dL.Pm), and double label area (dL.Ar). From these primary data, the following derived quantities were calculated: mineralizing surface (MS/BS = [1/2sL.Pm + dL.Pm]/B.Pm ×100; %); mineral apposition rate (MAR = dL.Ar/dL.Pm/6 days; μm/day) and bone formation rate (BFR/BS = MAR × MS/BS × 3.65; μm3/μm2 per year). A new set of relative (r) values: rMS/BS, rMAR, and rBFR/BS using the left ulna (nonloaded) values subtracted from the right ulna (loaded) values showed purely mechanically induced bone formation. Each ulnar cross-section used for histomorphometry was digitally captured through the microscope and imported into SCIONIMAGE, in which total area (Tt.Ar; mm2), cortical area (Ct.Ar; mm2), maximum second moment of inertia (IMAX; mm4); IMIN and Se.Dm were calculated. Mechanical strain was calculated for the medial periosteal surface of each histological section using methods described in Robling and Turner (32Robling A.G. Turner C.H. Bone. 2002; 31: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Calvarial osteoblasts were obtained from 3–5-day-old neonatal calvariae from WT and KO mice. Calvariae halves of the same genotype were grouped and subjected to four sequential 20-min digestions with enzyme mixture of 1.5 units/ml collagenase (Sigma) in PBS and 0.05% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA (Invitrogen) at room temperature on a rocking platform. The first digest was discarded. The second to the fourth digest were pooled, and cell pellet was collected after centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min. Cells were resuspended in α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) and passed through a 40-μm cell strainer (Falcon, BD Biosciences). Cell numbers were counted, and cells were plated at an initial density of 2,000 cells/cm2 in a T25 culture flask (Costar, Corning, NY) in α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), 100 units/ml penicillin G (Sigma), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), and maintained in a 95% air/5% CO2-humidified incubator at 37 °C. The cells were subcultured every 72 h. MC3T3-E1 cells, a preosteoblastic cell line (passage 10–20), were also cultured in α-MEM containing 10% FBS under the same conditions as the primary cells. MLO-Y4 osteocytes were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 5% calf serum. Fluid Shear—Primary cells, MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts, and MLO-Y4 osteocytes were seeded at a density of 2,000/cm2 and grown on 75 × 38-mm2 glass slides (Fisher Scientific) coated with 10 μg/cm2 collagen (BD Biosciences). Upon reaching 90% confluence (2–3 days), the cells were serum-starved for 24 h in 0.2% FBS-supplemented culture medium (the same medium used for flow). During the experiment, fluid flow was applied to the cell monolayer in a parallel plate flow chamber using a closed flow loop. This system subjected the cells to a steady laminar flow thus producing a 12 dynes/cm2 FSS. The apparatus was maintained at 37 °C, and the medium was aerated with 95% air/5% CO2 during experiment. In functional studies, the agonists were added immediately prior to flow, while the antagonists were applied to the cells for 30 min prior to flow. The cells were fluid-sheared for either 30 (for pore formation) or 15–60 min (for PGE2 assay). Control groups were set under the same conditions without flow or drug treatments. Agonists and Antagonists—To determine the functions of P2X7 ion channel, several agonists and antagonists were used. BzATP (300 μm, which has been shown to have a high affinity for the P2X7R (33Naemsch L.N. Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39107-39114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), was used to activate P2X7 ion channel and pore formation. The P2X7R-selective inhibitor, Brilliant Blue G (BBG) (1 μm), was used to block the P2X7 ion channel and pore formation. To determine the roles of FSS-induced ATP release in activation of P2X7R, apyrase (5 units/ml) was used. All the above reagents were purchased from Sigma. The P2X7 antibody that binds to the extracellular portion of the receptor to inhibit activation was obtained from Alomone Laboratories. Pore Formation Assay—Fluid shear stress-induced pore formation was determined by measuring cellular uptake of YO-PRO-1, molecular mass = 629 daltons; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in primary cells as well as MC3T3-E1 cells. As described above, the cells were fluid sheared for 30 min. After shear, the cells were rinsed once in PBS without Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions, which have been shown to inhibit pore formation (34Virginio C. Church D. North R.A. Surprenant A. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The YO-PRO-1 iodide dye (1 mm in Me2SO) was diluted to a final concentration of 2 μm in PBS (without Mg2+ and Ca2+) and then placed on the cells immediately and incubated for 10 min. Afterward, the cells were washed again with PBS without Mg2+ and Ca2+. The stain-positive cells were observed under an UV-lighted microscope. YO-PRO-1-positive cells were normalized to total cells in the same vision field. The ratios of YO-PRO-1-positive cells over total cells were compared between different treatment groups, and a statistical difference was considered significant when p value was less than 0.05 (5% level). The pore formation assays were repeated three times for each of the experimental conditions. Measurement of ATP—An ATP bioluminescence assay containing luciferin/luciferase reagent is used to detect ATP (ATP bioluminescence assay kit HS II, Roche Applied Science). This assay utilizes the conversion of d-luciferin by luciferase into oxyluciferin and light that requires ATP as a cofactor. The resultant luminescence, measured using a Monolight 3010 (Pharmingen), reflects ATP concentration. Media samples were taken 1 or 5 min after beginning fluid shear stress and immediately frozen at –80 °C for further analysis. Prostaglandin E2 Assay—Cells were subjected to fluid shear stress for either 15 or 60 min. After 60 min of fluid shear flow, 2 ml of 0.2% FBS α-MEM media was added onto the monolayer of cells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the incubator. After 30 min, the conditioned media were collected for PGE2 assay using a commercially available, competitive binding enzyme immunoassay kit (BioTrak, Amersham Biosciences). PGE2 release to the conditioned media was normalized to total cell protein. The protein assay was accomplished by Amino Black method as used in Western blot. Apoptosis Assay—To obtain a positive control for apoptosis, MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with TNF-α and cyclohexamide (CHX) for 6 h, then lysed for Western blot analysis (35Pavalko F.M. Gerard R.L. Ponik S.M. Gallagher P.J. Jin Y. Norvell S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 194: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Together with this positive control, cell lysates from different treatment groups of FSS, BzATP, as well as static control were resolved through 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted with caspase-3 antibody (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) as described below. Western Blot—Following treatment, cells were washed with cold PBS (1×), lysed with 2× sample buffer on ice, and immediately boiled for 5 min. The lysis buffer contained 150 mm NaCl, 26% glycerol (v/v), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and buffered with 5 mm Na+-HEPES (pH 7.9). The protein samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature to remove cellular debris and then quantified using the Amido Black method. Whole cell lysate (20 μg) and a prestained molecular weight marker (Bio-Rad) were boiled for 5 min and separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated with 1 μg/ml (1:250 in blocking buffer) rabbit anti-P2X7R antibody (Calbiochem) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed three times with TBST and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG hydroperoxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000 in blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBST, immunodetection was accomplished using the ECL method (Fuji machine). Statistical Analysis—All the data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between parameters in the loaded (right) and nonloaded (left) ulnae were tested using a paired t test. Dose response to different load magnitudes and mechanical strain within each gender WT or KO mice were tested for significance with least square regression. Differences in slope and x intercept (bone formation versus mechanical strain) between same gender WT and KO mice were tested for significance by analysis of covariance. For all tests, α = 0.05. In cellular studies, Western blots were made from either three separate isolations for primary cells or three different passages of cell lines. Significance was established from densitometry measurements using Dunnett's comparison to the static controls or Bonferroni post hoc test for multiple comparisons. P2X7R Null Mice Were Grossly Normal—In general, P2X7R KO mice appeared normal. At 18 weeks of age, body weights for male KO mice were higher (+5%; p = 0.02) than male WT controls. There were no differences in body weights between KO and WT female mice (p = 0.62). No differences in femoral length were found between KO and WT in female (p = 0.63) or male (p = 0.62) mice. The Osteogenic Response to Mechanical Loading Was Suppressed in P2X7R Null Mice—We hypothesized that the long bones of P2X7R null mice would be less responsive to mechanical loading. A verified experimental approach involving axial loading of the mouse ulna induced new bone formation, mainly at the medial and lateral quadrants of the periosteal surface (Fig. 1). The load-induced bone was lamellar based on the observation under polarized light microscope. Bone formation parameters rMS/BS, rMAR, and rBFR/BS were increased in a magnitude-dependent manner with mechanical loading. All bone formation parameters were significantly greater in WT mice than KO mice (p < 0.01). Of the bone formation parameters rBFR/BS best represents the new bone formation rate, which was closely correlated with peak mechanical strain calculated at the midshaft ulna (Fig. 2). Analysis of the correlations between mechanical strain and rBFR/BS revealed significant differences between WT and KO female mice (p < 0.01; Fig. 2A). Sensitivity to loading (the slope of rBFR/BS versus strain) in female KO mice was reduced by 61% compared with female WT mice, demonstrating that female WT mice exhibited significantly higher rBFR/BS per unit mechanical strain than female KO mice. Sensitivity to mechanical loading in male KO mice was reduced by 73% compared with male WT mice (p < 0.0001; Fig. 2B). In addition, the x intercept of the dose-response curve for the male KO mice was about 31% greater (p = 0.02) in comparison with male WT mice, indicating that more mechanical strain was required to initiate a response in KO mice.FIGURE 2Relative (right minus left) bone formation rate was normalized to peak mechanical strain. A, female P2X7R knock-out mice exhibited lower sensitivity than female wild type mice; B, male P2X7R knock-out mice exhibited a higher osteogenic threshold and a lower rBFR/BA versus strain slope (lower sensitivity).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ATP Release Is Not Suppressed in Osteoblasts from P2X7R Null Mice—To study the role of P2X7R in osteoblastic responsiveness to mechanical loading, we completed a series of experiments using cultured bone cells from newborn mouse calvaria osteoblasts. Western blot analysis revealed that the P2X7R receptor was present in WT but not KO cells, whereas MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and MLO-Y4 osteocytes expressed high levels of P2X7R (Fig. 3). We have shown that FSS produces a 10-fold increase in ATP release in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts within 1 min of the onset of FSS (36Genetos D.C. Geist D.J. Liu D. Donahue H.J. Duncan R.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 41-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

In pathogenic microorganisms extracellular proteases may be adapted to interactions with host cells. Here we describe two cell surface-associated aspartic proteases, Sap9 and Sap10, which have structural similarities to yapsins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and are produced by the human pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Sap9 and Sap10 are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored and located in the cell membrane or the cell wall. Both proteases are glycosylated, cleave at dibasic or basic processing sites similar to yapsins and Kex2-like proteases, and have functions in cell surface integrity and cell separation during budding. Overexpression of SAP9 in mutants lacking KEX2 or SAP10, or of SAP10 in mutants lacking KEX2 or SAP9, only partially restored these phenotypes, suggesting distinct target proteins of fungal origin for each of the three proteases. In addition, deletion of SAP9 and SAP10 modified the adhesion properties of C. albicans to epithelial cells and caused attenuated epithelial cell damage during experimental oral infection suggesting a unique role for these proteases in both cellular processes and host-pathogen interactions.

Proteases possess multiple functions in nature ranging from regulation of subtle cellular processes by activating distinct proproteins to nonspecific degradation of proteins for recycling of biomolecules. Several pathogenic microorganisms have adapted this biochemical property to fulfill a number of specialized functions during the infective process. The substrate specificities of these proteases may be very narrow, as in the case of bacterial toxins responsible for botulism or anthrax. In contrast, facultative pathogens may secrete proteases that have more general and much broader effects and play important roles in both saprophytic growth and infection. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has served as a eukaryotic model organism to study functions of regulatory proteases including the Kex2 protein, a proprotein processing subtilisin-like serine protease of the late Golgi compartment (1Fuller R.S.

Characteristic of target proteins of Kex2-like proteases are N-terminal processing sites with dibasic amino acids, in particular Lys-Arg. Although Kex2 was shown to be the major protease for processing at dibasic residues, alternative pathways exist in S. cerevisiae (10Egel-Mitani M. Flygenring H.P. Hansen M.T.

However, the biological roles of yapsins are unknown. glycosylphosphatidylinositol secretory aspartic protease green fluorescent protein buccal epithelial cell synthetic defined medium reconstituted human epithelium. The human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans is closely related to S. cerevisiae, sharing over 60% orthologous genes (14d'Enfert C. Goyard S. Rodriguez-Arnaveilhe S. Frangeul L. Jones L. Tekaia F. Bader O. Albrecht A. Castillo L. Dominguez A. Ernst J.F. Fradin C. Gaillardin C. Garcia-Sanchez S. de Groot P. Hube B. Klis F.M. Krishnamurthy S. Kunze D. Lopez M.C. Mavor A. Martin N. Moszer I.

However, the function of these genes may have altered, because C. albicans has been long adapted to the human host, and these alterations may therefore be directly linked to survival and pathogenicity. Furthermore, the C. albicans genes with no counterpart in S. cerevisiae may have evolved because of the specific demands of the human host environment. These include a gene family encoding secretory aspartic proteases (Sap) (15Naglik J.R. Challacombe S.J. Hube B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 400-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Saps were shown to contribute to several virulence attributes of C. albicans during the infection process, with Sap1–3 required for mucosal infections and Sap4–6 for systemic infections (16Felk A. Kretschmar M. Albrecht A. Schaller M. Beinhauer S. Nichterlein T. Sanglard D. Korting H.C. Schafer W. Hube B. Infect.

Microbiol. 1999; 34: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). All SAP genes are translated into preproenzymes with dibasic motifs in the propeptide. For Sap2, a prototypic member of this family that can digest a variety of host proteins in the extracellular space, processing by Kex2 has been demonstrated (18Newport G. Agabian N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28954-28961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, alternative processing pathways appear to exist in C. albicans, as a Δkex2 mutant was able to activate proSap2 in a yapsin-like manner. In this study we show that Sap9 and Sap10 are crucial for the infection process. In contrast to the other family members, they are GPI-anchored yapsin-like aspartic proteases that target proteins of fungal origin necessary for cell surface integrity, cell separation, and adhesion. Strains and Growth Conditions—C. albicans strains SC5314 (19Gillum A.M. Tsay E.Y. Kirsch D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 198: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) and CAI-4 carrying CIp10 (20Murad A.M. Lee P.R. Broadbent I.D. Barelle C.J. Brown A.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 325-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used as wild type controls. CAI-4 (21Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to produce mutants either lacking or overexpressing SAP genes. For phenotypic screening, cells were diluted to give concentrations of 2000, 200, 20, and 2 cells/μl. Five μl of these cell suspensions were dropped onto agar supplemented as indicated. To determine differences in cell separation cells were grown in liquid SD medium until mid-log phase. Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Cells were harvested in mid-log phase in liquid SD medium. Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into cDNA, and SAP9 and SAP10 were amplified using the Qiagen QuantiTect™ reverse transcription-PCR kit as described by the manufacturer. The gene ACT1 was used as an internal standard. Amplification and detection of specific products was performed with the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (PE-Applied Biosystems). In Vivo SAP Expression in Patient Oral Samples—Whole saliva samples were collected from 40 patients with active C. albicans infection (clinical signs of disease and >2000 C. albicans colony-forming units/ml of saliva) and 29 asymptomatic C. albicans carriers (no clinical signs and harboring 50–800 C. albicans colony-forming units/ml of saliva) attending the Oral Medicine clinic at Guy's Hospital, London. Upon collection, the total RNA was isolated and examined for ACT1 (positive control), SAP9, and SAP10 expression using a modified radioactive 32P-based reverse-transcriptase-PCR system (Access, Promega) as described previously (23Naglik J.R. Newport G. White T.C. Fernandes-Naglik L.L. Greenspan J.S. Greenspan D. Sweet S.P. Challacombe S.J. Agabian N. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2482-2490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Naglik J.R.

Gene Disruption and Overexpression—The Ura-blaster protocol (21Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to disrupt SAP9 and SAP10. An internal fragment (bp +1169 to +1246) of SAP9 was replaced with the hisG-URA3-hisG cassette to give pAF9ura. For deletion of SAP10, the hisG-URA3-hisG cassette was flanked with the SAP10 region from positions +11 to +521 and +804 to +1206 to give pAA10ura. pAF9ura and pAA10ura were linearized and transformed into strain CAI-4 and 5-fluoroorotic acid-treated (Ura–) Δsap9. Two rounds of Ura-blasting were performed to disrupt both alleles of SAP9 and SAP10 to give Δsap9 and Δsap10 and the double mutant Δsap9/Δsap10, respectively. Each step of integration and disruption was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot. To rescue the wild type phenotype in mutants lacking SAP9 and SAP10, the entire regions from SAP9 (bp –981 to +1769 bp) and SAP10 (bp –807 to +1567) were cloned into CIp10 to give CIp10-SAP9 and CIp10-SAP10. Plasmids were transformed into Ura– Δsap9 or Δsap10, respectively, after linearization. For overexpression of SAP9 (bp +1to +1879) and SAP10 (bp +1to +1567), fragments were cloned under the control of the C. albicans ACT1 promoter (25Barelle C.J. Manson C.L. MacCallum D.M. Odds F.C. Gow N.A. Brown A.J. Yeast. 2004; 21: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) to obtain pACT1-SAP9 and pACT1-SAP10. Plasmids were linearization and transformed into CAI-4. In the corresponding controls, linearized CIp10 and pACT1 (22Fradin C. De Groot P. MacCallum D. Schaller M. Klis F. Odds F.C. Hube B. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 397-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) were transformed into CAI-4, (Ura–) Δsap9, or Δsap10. Single integration of these plasmids at the RPS1 (formerly RPS10) locus was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Sap-Gfp Protein Fusion—To construct pACT1-SAP9-GFP and pACT1-SAP10-GFP, GFP was fused to 5′- and 3′-fragments of SAP9 and SAP10 containing sequences encoding the putative Kex2 processing sites and the entire C-terminal sequences that prevented secretion into the culture in Pichia pastoris clones (Fig. 1). Plasmids were integrated into the RPS1 locus of CAI-4. Immunoelectron Microscopy—Sap9 and Sap10 were localized ultrastructurally by immunoelectron microscopy of C. albicans strains containing pACT1-SAP9-GFP, pACT1-SAP10-GFP, pACT1-GFP (control 1), or pGFP (control 2) with anti-Gfp, as described previously (22Fradin C. De Groot P. MacCallum D. Schaller M. Klis F. Odds F.C. Hube B. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 397-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). N-Glycosidase F Treatment—To verify putative N-glycosylation of Sap9 and Sap10, heterologously expressed proteins were incubated with and without N-glycosidase F according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained. Adherence Assay—Strains SC5314, CAI-4::CIp10, Δsap9, Δsap9[SAP9], Δsap10, Δsap10[SAP10], and Δsap9/Δsap10 were grown on SD-agar plates. Buccal epithelial cells (BECs) were gently scraped from a healthy donor with cotton swabs. C. albicans, and BEC suspensions were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and resuspended at a concentration of 107 cells/ml and 105 cells/ml, respectively. Suspension were mixed in equal volumes (100 μl) and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. BECs were collected on a polycarbonate filter, and nonadherent C. albicans cells were washed through the filter pores. The percentage of BECs with C. albicans cells attached was monitored for at least 100 epithelial cells per sample. Infection Models—To model systemic infection, mice were injected intravenously and monitored as described previously (20Murad A.M. Lee P.R. Broadbent I.D. Barelle C.J. Brown A.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 325-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All animal work was carried out under the terms and conditions stipulated by the Home Office, United Kingdom. Reconstituted human epithelium (RHE) infected with C. albicans as described previously (22Fradin C. De Groot P. MacCallum D. Schaller M. Klis F. Odds F.C. Hube B. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 397-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) provided a model for oral infection. RHE medium was sampled to assay the release of lactate dehydrogenase as a measure of epithelial cell damage, and histological sections of the RHE were examined. Cell Wall Isolation and Determination of Protein and Chitin Contents—To assess any possible changes in cell wall composition resulting from deletion of SAP9 or SAP10, cell walls were isolated as described previously (26de Groot P.W. de Boer A.D. Cunningham J. Dekker H.L. de Jong L. Hellingwerf K.J. de Koster C. Klis F.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 955-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Protein and chitin contents were determined using a modified method according to Yabe et al. (27Yabe T. Yamada-Okabe T. Kasahara S. Furuichi Y. Nakajima T. Ichishima E. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 477-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which involves acid hydrolysis to break down chitin to glucosamine. Production of Recombinant Proteases—Expression plasmids were constructed by insertion of PCR products into the P. pastoris expression vector pKJ113 (28Eisenhaber B. Schneider G. Wildpaner M. Eisenhaber F. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). P. pastoris transformation, and production of recombinant enzymes was described previously (29Olsen V. Guruprasad K. Cawley N.X. Chen H.C. Blundell T.L. Loh Y.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2768-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Culture supernatants were harvested and dialyzed against 20 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 150 mm NaCl (buffer A). Proteases were purified on a Superdex™ 75 column equilibrated in buffer A using Acta explorer FPLC (Amersham Biosciences). Synthesis of Peptides and Substrate Specificity—Peptides derived from protein sequences of C. albicans Sap2, Sap7, and Sap9 and human vimentin were synthesized by the solid-phase method. Standard conditions for the cleavage of peptides were as follows. 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 200 mm NaCl, 330 μm peptide, and 0.6 μm purified heterologously expressed Sap9 or Sap10 in a total volume of 120 μl, incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cleavage products were separated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18 column in a methanol/H2O system, and fractions were analyzed by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry analysis on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF, Bruker Daltonics). SAP9 and SAP10 Encode Aspartic Proteases with Structural Similarities to Yapsins—SAP9 and SAP10 code for preproenzymes with a signal peptide removed in the endoplasmic reticulum and a propeptide with Lys-Arg residues, known as proteolytic processing sites for Kex2 (Fig. 1). Like all other members of the Sap family, the mature Sap9 and Sap10 proteins possess four conserved cysteine residues and two conserved aspartate residues. Sequence comparisons revealed that C. albicans Sap9 and Sap10 differ from the other Sap1–8 isoenzymes not only by sequence similarity (Fig. 2) but also by multiple N-glycosylation sites and putative GPI anchor attachment sequences at their C termini (28Eisenhaber B. Schneider G. Wildpaner M. Eisenhaber F. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), a recognized structural property of yapsins. Sap9 and Sap10 are N-Glycosylated and GPI-anchored on the Cell Surface—To determine whether Sap9 and Sap10 are in fact GPI proteins, we used a series of constructs to express native and C-terminal truncated versions of Sap9 and Sap10 in the yeast P. pastoris (Fig. 1). Expression of native Sap9 and Sap10 prevented secretion of these proteases. However, secretion was observed when parts of the C-terminal sequences of the GPI anchor consensus sequence were deleted and was highest when the complete consensus sequence was removed. These data suggest that the C termini prevent secretion of Sap9 and Sap10. For cellular localization of the two proteases, we constructed Sap9- and Sap10-Gfp fusion proteins by inserting the GFP gene into the protease sequences directly after the Kex2 processing site and attaching the C-terminal sequences that prevented secretion in P. pastoris. Immunoelectron microscopy using an anti-Gfp antibody revealed that both fusion proteins are located on the cell surface of C. albicans (Fig. 1). However, the distribution of antigen was different for the two fusion proteins; Sap9-Gfp was predominantly located in cell membranes, whereas Sap10-Gfp was located in both the cell membrane and the cell wall (Fig. 1). SDS protein gel analysis of purified Sap9 and Sap10 proteins revealed two subunits for Sap9, with sizes of ∼68 and 10 kDa and only one polypeptide with 60 kDa for Sap10 (Fig. 3). In contrast to other members of the Sap family, which possess a maximum of one potential N-glycosylation site within the sequence of the mature enzyme, Sap9 and Sap10 contain, respectively, five and eight such sites. Treatment of Sap9 and Sap10 with N-glycosidase F caused a clear band shift for both proteases, suggesting that Sap9 and Sap10 are N-glycosylated (Fig. 3). Thus, Sap9 and Sap10 are highly N-glycosylated proteases, which are GPI-anchored on the cell surface. Sap9 and Sap10 Digest Peptides at Distinct Sites—Because Sap9 and Sap10 were exposed to the extracellular space but attached to the cell membrane or cell wall, we concluded that proteolysis by Sap9 and Sap10 must take place on the cell surface and that putative substrates of these proteases may be of either host or fungal origin. To identify possible target proteins of Sap9 and Sap10, several host proteins known to be substrates of other Saps (15Naglik J.R. Challacombe S.J. Hube B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 400-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) were exposed to heterologously expressed enzymes. None of the tested proteins, including serum albumin, collagen, hemoglobin, keratin, mucin, or immunoglobulins, were hydrolyzed in a Sap2-like manner (data not shown). In contrast, several synthetic peptides containing basic or dibasic amino acid motifs were digested by Sap9 or Sap10 or by both proteases (Table 1). Digests were similar to the activity of S. cerevisiae yapsins or Kex2-regulatory proteases with hydrolysis at KR, KK, or single Lys (K) sites (Table 1). Sap9 and Sap10 preferred cleavage after dibasic (KR, KK) or monobasic (Lys, Arg) residues, similar to yapsin 1 and 2, whereas the Kex2 protease cleaves only C-terminally to clusters of dibasic residues (13Komano H. Rockwell N. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24431-24437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Olsen V. Guruprasad K. Cawley N.X. Chen H.C.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3386-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Addition of uncharged Asn into the P1′ side in the peptide PISKRNERS abolished cleavage by Sap9 but maintained the processing with Sap10 (Table 1). In addition, Sap10 digested at sites previously unknown for yapsin-like aspartic proteases (between Phe-Ser and His-Asn). Interestingly, the peptide KIHNKLFGF, which is identical to an internal sequence of Sap9 (Lys149 to Phe157 from the N terminus), was processed by Sap9 between Lys and Leu154. This suggests self-processing activity of Sap9 at this site, which possibly accounts for the two subunits observed in this study and by others (11Cawley N.X. Chino M. Maldonado A. Rodriguez Y.M. Loh Y.P. Ellman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5523-5530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of the larger β-subunit was previously shown to be Leu154-Phe-Gly-Phe (11Cawley N.X. Chino M. Maldonado A. Rodriguez Y.M. Loh Y.P. Ellman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5523-5530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), identical to the N-terminal sequence of one fragment of the digested peptide. These data suggest that Sap9 and Sap10 are proteases that hydrolyze polypeptides at distinct processing sites.TABLE 1Digestion by Sap9 or Sap10Processing after Arg and LysProcessing after Lys, Phe, or HisTTTKR*SAGFF*S¯VVK*T̲PKAPISKR*N¯ERSKIH*N¯K*L̲FGFR*F¯VKR*D̲̲GSLNVTVK*DLSFPISKR*E̲̲RSRTNEK*VELQK*T¯SKR*Q̲AVPNTEFK*NTRTKGQGK*SRLGANKK*T̲̲GAFF Open table in a new tab Sap9 and Sap10 Are Necessary for Cell Surface Integrity and Cell Separation during Budding—To determine the possible functions of the two proteases, we constructed Δsap9 and Δsap10 single mutants and a Δsap9/Δsap10 double mutant. All mutant strains grew normally on media containing different carbon sources, at different pH values, on hyphal inducing media or when incubated at different temperatures (data not shown). However, components that directly or indirectly target the fungal cell surface such as hygromycin B (Fig. 4A), amorolfine, calcofluor, Congo red, and itraconazole (not shown) caused significant growth defects for all mutants. In addition, nikkomycin inhibited growth of the Δsap9 mutant (not shown). Observed phenotypes were at least partially restored by mutants carrying plasmid-borne Sap9 or Sap10 (Fig. 4A). Together, these data suggest a role of Sap9 and Sap10 in cell surface integrity. Furthermore, all three mutants exhibited an abnormal budding phenotype, as daughter cells did not separate from mother cells and remained associated in cell chains (Fig. 4B). Because it is known that blockage of protein activities involved in cell membrane or cell wall maintenance can be compensated for by the up-regulation of proteins involved in the production of alternative structural elements, we quantified the protein and chitin levels in the cell walls of the mutants. Chitin levels of the Δsap9 mutant were significantly increased (4.0 ± 0.9% S.D.; t test, p = 0.05), whereas the Δsap10 mutant showed increased levels of both protein (7.5 ± 0.6%; t test, p = 0.05) and chitin (3.4 ± 0.7%; t test, p = 0.05) as compared with the parental strain (protein 5.8 ± 0.7%; chitin 1.9 ± 0.5%). Sap9, Sap10, and Kex2 Have Distinct Cellular Functions—Our results, together with previous data (18Newport G. Agabian N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28954-28961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), suggest that Sap9 and Sap10 and the processing serine protease Kex2 in C. albicans all may be involved in the maintenance of cell surface integrity. To investigate whether Sap9, Sap10, and Kex2 have overlapping functions, we constructed SAP9 and SAP10 overexpression vectors, which were integrated into the single mutants (SAP9 into Δsap10 or Δkex2, respectively; SAP10 into Δsap9 or Δkex2, respectively). Phenotypic screening of these strains showed little or no overlapping function of the three proteases. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis of the mutants revealed a 2-fold over-expression of SAP9 in the Δkex2 mutant, a 2-fold over-expression of SAP9 in the Δsap10 mutant, and a 4-fold over-expression of SAP10 in the Δsap9 mutant, suggesting that the loss of one processing protease gene induces up-regulation of the other genes (data not shown). Deletion of SAP9 or SAP10 Modifies Adhesion to Epithelial Cells and Causes Attenuated Epithelial Cell Damage during Experimental Oral Infections—To investigate whether dysfunctions in cell surface integrity resulting from SAP9 or SAP10 deletion influenced virulence of C. albicans, we investigated the potential of Δsap9 and Δsap10 mutants to cause infections. Both mutants were only moderately attenuated in a mouse model of systemic infection after intravenous challenge (not shown). However, the same mutants had a significantly reduced ability to invade and damage epithelial cells in a model of oral infection based on RHE (Fig. 5). One possible explanation for the attenuated virulence phenotype in the RHE model could be a reduced ability of the mutant strains to adhere to epithelial cells, thus resulting in reduced invasion and cell damage. This may indeed be the case for Δsap10, as adherence of this mutant to BECs was reduced (Fig. 6). However, the ability of the Δsap9 mutant to adhere to epithelial cells was dramatically increased as compared with the wild type, suggesting that properties other than reduced adhesion attributes were responsible for the decreased epithelial cell damage of Δsap9. Interestingly, the phenotype of the double mutant Δsap9/Δsap10 showed reduced adhesion resembling the phenotype of the Δsap10 and not the Δsap9 single mutant (Fig. 6). Therefore, activity of Sap9 and Sap10 is necessary for wild type adhesion properties and invasion and cell damage of oral epithelial cells. In Vivo SAP Expression in Oral Samples from Patients—If SAP9 and SAP10 play a virulence role during oral infections, both of these genes would be predicted to be expressed in vivo by C. albicans strains colonizing and infecting the oral cavity. To demonstrate this possibility, we analyzed SAP9 and SAP10 expression in total RNA samples isolated from the saliva of a large number of patients (40 symptomatic C. albicans infected and 29 asymptomatic C. albicans carriers). SAP9 and SAP10 transcripts were detected in 98 and 93% of C. albicans-infected patients, respectively, and in 83 and 86% of C. albicans carriers, respectively. This indicates that both SAP genes are frequently expressed both in the commensal stage and during infection, suggesting an important role for growth and/or survival in the oral cavity. The model yeast S. cerevisiae and the human pathogenic fungus C. albicans share a large portion of similar genes, which may, however, have different functions because of the different natural environments of these two fungal species. Data presented in this study suggest that C. albicans is equipped with 10 extracellular aspartic proteases, Sap1–10, which are either secreted (Sap1–8) or associated with the cell surface (Sap9 and Sap10). However, the functions of these two subclasses of extracellular aspartic proteases seem to be fundamentally different. Proteases Sap1–6 are known to hydrolyze host proteins and consequently to cause tissue damage (15Naglik J.R. Challacombe S.J. Hube B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 400-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). In contrast, our data suggest that Sap9 and Sap10 are linked to regulatory processes on the fung"
https://openalex.org/W1997341464,"One model to explain the relationship between patterning and growth during development posits that growth is regulated by the slope of morphogen gradients. The Decapentaplegic (DPP) morphogen controls growth in the Drosophila wing, but the slope of the DPP activity gradient has not been shown to influence growth. By employing a method for spatial, temporal, and quantitative control over gene expression, we show that the juxtaposition of cells perceiving different levels of DPP signaling is essential for medial-wing-cell proliferation and can be sufficient to promote the proliferation of cells throughout the wing. Either activation or inhibition of the DPP pathway in clones at levels distinct from those in surrounding cells stimulates nonautonomous cell proliferation. Conversely, uniform activation of the DPP pathway inhibits cell proliferation in medial wing cells. Our observations provide a direct demonstration that the slope of a morphogen gradient regulates growth during development."
https://openalex.org/W2164760302,"Amino acid deprivation triggers dramatic physiological responses in all organisms, altering both the synthesis and destruction of RNA and protein. Here we describe, using the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, a previously unidentified response to amino acid deprivation in which mature transfer RNA (tRNA) is cleaved in the anticodon loop. We observed that anticodon loop cleavage affects a small fraction of most or all tRNA sequences. Accumulation of cleaved tRNA is temporally coordinated with the morphological and metabolic changes of adaptation to starvation. The starvation-induced endonucleolytic cleavage activity targets tRNAs that have undergone maturation by 5′ and 3′ end processing and base modification. Curiously, the majority of cleaved tRNAs lack the 3′ terminal CCA nucleotides required for aminoacylation. Starvation-induced tRNA cleavage is inhibited in the presence of essential amino acids, independent of the persistence of other starvation-induced responses. Our findings suggest that anticodon loop cleavage may reduce the accumulation of uncharged tRNAs as part of a specific response induced by amino acid starvation.

Our findings suggest that anticodon loop cleavage may reduce the accumulation of uncharged tRNAs as part of a specific response induced by amino acid starvation. Transfer RNA (tRNA) plays a critical role in gene expression by linking mRNA sequence to protein synthesis. Amino acids are brought to the ribosome and transferred to nascent polypeptides with specificity dictated by tRNAs (1Ibba M. Soll D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mature eukaryotic tRNAs must be extensively processed from precursor transcripts by removal of the 5′ leader and 3′ trailer sequences and, for intron-containing tRNAs, by splicing (2Hopper A.K. Phizicky E.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 162-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Maturation also requires 3′ end addition of three nucleotides, cytidinecytidine-adenosine (CCA), and extensive base modification. Most eukaryotic tRNA maturation steps are completed in the nucleus with the exception of some base modifications and intron splicing in yeast (3Yoshihisa T. Yunoki-Esaki K. Ohshima C. Tanaka N. Endo T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A properly processed tRNA can be aminoacylated in the nucleus, which facilitates its nuclear export (4Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1998; 282: 2082-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In contrast, unmodified or mis-folded tRNAs are polyadenylated in a manner that promotes nuclear exosome-mediated degradation (5Vanacova S. Wolf J. Martin G. Blank D. Dettwiler S. Friedlein A.

Thus, quality control mechanisms destroy improperly processed eukaryotic tRNAs that might otherwise interfere with optimal cellular function. Similar tRNA quality control exists in prokaryotes as well (8Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45041-45044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Li Z. Reimers S. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1132-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Transfer RNA serves a second, less well characterized role in gene expression by acting as a signaling molecule. This function of tRNAs has been studied most extensively in prokaryotes and yeasts during amino acid starvation (10Chatterji D. Ojha A.K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 11Hinnebusch A.G. Natarajan K. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Starvation accelerates the degradation of existing RNA and protein molecules, primarily those of the ribosome. This recycling of nucleotides and amino acids, along with a general repression of transcription and translation, is coupled to selective synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins required for cell survival. In Escherichia coli, these changes in metabolism are initiated by an increased ratio of uncharged tRNA to aminoacylated tRNA, which in turn induces accumulation of the transcriptional regulator ppGpp (10Chatterji D. Ojha A.K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In yeast, uncharged tRNA binds and activates Gcn2p, a kinase that phosphorylates the α-subunit of eIF2 (translation initiation factor 2) (12Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This reduces global protein synthesis while stimulating synthesis of Gcn4p, a transcriptional regulator for amino acid biosynthesis genes (11Hinnebusch A.G. Natarajan K. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 14Gebauer F. Hentze M.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). In contrast to prokaryotes and yeast, which can synthesize all 20 amino acids, animals must rely on diet to provide an essential 10 amino acids. A role for GCN2 is conserved, however, as indicated by activation of the murine GCN2 ortholog in mice fed diets lacking essential amino acids (15Dever T.E. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 141-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These studies reveal a critical role for murine GCN2 in regulating feeding behavior. The ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila requires exogenous sources of the same 10 essential amino acids as animals, as well as serine and nucleotides (16Frankel J. Methods Cell. Biol. 2000; 62: 27-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Starvation induces metabolic changes in T. thermophila that can be grouped into an early response lasting ∼6 h followed by a longer term response. These two phases are characterized on the cellular level by changes in morphology and swimming behavior and are distinguished on the metabolic level by different rates of ribosome degradation (17Nelsen E.M. Dev. Biol. 1978; 66: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Sutton C.A. Hallberg R.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 101: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We have made the surprising finding in T. thermophila that tRNA “halves” accumulate during the early response to essential amino acid starvation. Our study suggests that endonucleolytic cleavage in the tRNA anticodon loop targets uncharged tRNA for degradation. We propose that this regulated degradation contributes to starvation adaptation. Possible biological functions for this novel tRNA cleavage activity are discussed. Strains and Cell Culture—For vegetative growth and starvation, T. thermophila strain SB210 was cultured as described (19Witkin K.L. Collins K. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1107-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For amino acid feeding, vegetatively growing cells were harvested and washed two times in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, before resuspension in Tris containing various amino acids at concentrations defined previously for nutritionally complete media (20Szablewski L. Hove Andreasen P. Tiedtke A. Florin-Christensen J. Florin-Christensen M. Rasmussen L. J. Protozool. 1991; 31: 62-65Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cultures were returned to 30 °C for 2–4 h. Essential amino acids in T. thermophila are Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Ser, Thr, Trp, and Val. Cycloheximide treatment was performed as described (21Miller M.C. Collins K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 827-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). RNA Detection, Cloning, and Identification—Total RNA was isolated from whole cells using Trizol (Invitrogen). Aminoacylated and uncharged tRNA were separated on acid-urea 6–9% polyacrylamide gels as described (22Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deacylated tRNA markers were generated by incubation of RNA samples at pH 9.0 for 30 min at 30 °C. SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes) staining was used to visualize RNAs on denaturing 12–15% acrylamide-urea 0.6× Tris borate-EDTA gels and acid-urea gels. To detect tRNAs by Northern blotting, RNA was transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with 5′ end-labeled DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the terminal 22 nucleotides, excluding the 3′ CCA, of individual tRNAs. As a control for induction of starvation, Northern blot probes were designed against the noncoding RNA G8 (23Kraus K.W. Good P.J. Hallberg R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Hallberg E.M. Fung P. Hallberg R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 912Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). RNA cloning was performed according to established methods (25Pfeffer S. Lagos-Quintana M. Tuschl T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York2005: 26.24.18-26.24.21Google Scholar), with some modifications. The RNAs to be cloned were treated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science), gel-fractionated, and eluted in 0.3 m sodium acetate at 37 °C. DNA/RNA adapters (Integrated DNA Technologies, see below) with BanI sites were ligated to sRNA ends with T4 RNA ligase (Amersham Biosciences). Concatamers of BanI-digested RT-PCR products obtained with T4 DNA ligase (200 units/ml, New England Biolabs) were treated with alkaline phosphatase and TOPO-cloned (Invitrogen). The cloned RNAs were from cells starved for 3 h (29% of total cell equivalents) and for 6.5–7 h (71%). The 3′ adapter was: 5′-/5′-phosphate/rCrCrCTAGGCACCTACAA/3′-amino modifierC7/-3′. The 5′ adapter was: 5′-AATCATGGCACCATrGrGrG-3′. Predicted and/or known tRNAs were identified using preliminary T. thermophila macronuclear sequence data from The Institute for Genomic Research (www.tigr.org) and tRNAscan-SE 1.21 (www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/tRNAscan-SE/). Starvation Induces Cleavage of tRNA in the Anticodon Loop—In characterizing the small noncoding RNAs expressed in starving T. thermophila, we observed a population of ∼30–35-nucleotide RNAs on gels stained directly for RNA with SYBR Gold (Fig. 1). Accumulation of these RNAs was highest during early starvation, peaking around 3 h after transfer from nutrient-rich to inorganic media. These RNAs were not evident in total RNA or small RNA-enriched samples isolated from vegetatively growing, mating, or heat-shocked cells (data not shown). Stationary phase cultures exhibited a low level of the ∼30–35-nucleotide RNAs (data not shown). To characterize these RNAs further, we isolated the starvation-induced small RNA population by elution from gel slices and cloned 203 representative cDNAs. The majority of sequences matched the recently sequenced T. thermophila genome at multiple, clustered loci. Of the 198 cDNAs with genomic matches, only 89 were unique (see supplemental data), indicating that nearly all of the RNA species amenable to cloning were identified. To our surprise, GenBank™ searches and analysis using tRNAscan-SE (26Lowe T.M. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (7899) Google Scholar) revealed these cloned sequences to be derived from tRNAs. The vast majority of tRNAs represented in the cloned population are encoded by the macronuclear genome; only a single tRNA is encoded by the mitochondrial genome. The cloverleaf tRNA representation shown in Fig. 2 depicts the basepairing of four helices that stack to form the functional tRNA (27Soll D. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 157-184Google Scholar). The starvation-induced tRNA fragments included both the left and right halves of the cloverleaf, with a distribution of 5′ and 3′ ends summarized in Fig. 2. Independently cloned halves derived from the same side of any given tRNA differed only slightly in their 5′ and 3′ ends (see supplemental data). A number of cDNA mismatches with genomic sequence were evident. Depending on the fidelity of reverse transcription through modified bases, some modifications will be detected as apparent mutations in cDNA sequence. Although tRNA modification has not been studied extensively in T. thermophila, it is likely to be similar to other eukaryotes. Close examination of the cloned tRNA fragment sequences revealed that several mismatches with genomic sequence occurred at predicted sites of tRNA modification. For example, the conserved adenosine at tRNA consensus position 58 is often modified to 1-methyladenosine (28Auffinger P. Westof E. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 569-576Google Scholar), and this position was frequently represented by non-adenosine residues in cloned tRNA halves (see supplemental data). This evidence for base modification, combined with the observation that none of the tRNA fragments contained 5′ leader, intron, or 3′ trailer sequences of pre-tRNA, suggests that the starvation-induced tRNA halves are generated from fully mature or substantially processed tRNAs rather than from nascent tRNA transcripts. The most frequently cloned tRNA halves were from asparagine, glycine, and threonine isoacceptors (TABLE ONE). The abundance of tRNAs has been found to be proportional to their corresponding gene copy number (29Percudani R. Pavesi A. Ottonello S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 30Dong H. Nilsson L. Kurland C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 31Kanaya S. Yamada Y. Kudo Y. Ikemura T. Gene. 1999; 238: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, no correlation was found between the representation of a given tRNA in the cloned fragment pool and its gene copy number. Additionally, the population of cloned tRNA halves did not appear to reflect relative codon usage in the limited set of expressed genes analyzed to date (32Larsen L.K. Andreasen P.H. Dreisig H.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the actual distribution of tRNAs cleaved without potential bias from cloning, we probed for individual tRNAs in total RNA samples by Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 3). Northern blot analysis revealed that upon induction of starvation, tRNA halves accumulate from all tRNAs examined including those not represented in the cloned population. Because our cloning approached saturation, it is likely that some tRNA halves were simply not amenable to the cloning protocol used, perhaps because of base modification or RNA secondary structure. Consistent with the slight end heterogeneity of cloned tRNA halves, distinct species differing in size by a few nucleotides were observed on Northern blots probed for the 3′ halves of individual tRNAs. A few exceptions to the anticodon loop specificity of cleavage were observed; cleavage occurred in the loop of the extended variable stems in the leucine and serine isoacceptors with predicted anticodons UAA and AGA, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3 and supplemental data). Because tRNA halves do not persist into the longer term phase of the starvation response (Fig. 1), we suggest that loop cleavage initiates a complete degradation of targeted tRNAs. Together, these findings suggest that endonucleolytic cleavage of most or all tRNA sequences can occur at one or more sites in the anticodon (or variable) loop. This cleavage could be catalyzed by a site-specific nuclease that recognizes tRNA structure or by an enzyme that targets structured RNAs generally. In either scenario, endonucleolytic cleavage would provide exonuclease access to the loop residues. Site-specific tRNA splicing endonucleases catalyze removal of introns that interrupt the tRNA anticodon loop (36Abelson J. Trotta C.R. Li H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12685-12688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, because a splicing endonuclease specifically recognizes the intron, it would be unlikely to mediate the starvation-induced tRNA cleavage, which targets tRNAs encoded by both intron-containing and intron-less genes. Starvation-induced tRNA Cleavage May Target Deacylated tRNAs—The tRNA 3′ CCA must be added to allow aminoacylation (37Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, only a small minority of right-side tRNA halves in the cloned population bore evidence of terminal CCA addition; one contained all three nucleotides, whereas another one carried a single C (Fig. 2 and supplemental data). This finding suggests that cleavage occurs preferentially for tRNAs that are deacylated and thus unprotected from turnover of the terminal CCA (38Deutscher M.P. Lin J.J. Evans J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1081-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because only a small percentage of any given tRNA was cleaved (Fig. 3), we next sought to determine the extent of tRNA deacylation in starved cells. We compared levels of aminoacylated and deacylated tRNA using acid-urea gel electrophoresis, which separates charged from uncharged tRNA by mobility (22Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Charged tRNA migrates with significantly slower mobility than uncharged tRNA on acid-urea gels, allowing the two populations to be easily distinguished (for example, see Fig. 4B, top panel, compare lanes 1 and 2). Bulk tRNA detected by direct staining and individual tRNAs detected by Northern blot hybridization remained predominantly aminoacylated throughout starvation (Fig. 4; additional data not shown). The minor fraction of apparently full-length, deacylated tRNA present in all samples did not change upon transition from vegetative growth to starvation (Fig. 4B, top panel). Given the uniform and minor population of deacylated tRNA, we cannot be certain whether deacylation occurred in vivo or during isolation of RNA from whole cells. In contrast, at early time points of starvation, we detected the differential accumulation of a species with slightly faster mobility than deacylated, full-length tRNA. This species reproducibly peaked in accumulation just before the peak in levels of the tRNA halves (Fig. 4B, bottom panel; additional data not shown). We suggest that this tRNA population represents deacylated tRNAs lacking 3′ terminal CCA nucleotides. These truncated tRNAs may accumulate only transiently because of complete degradation following cleavage in the anticodon loop. Essential Amino Acids Block Starvation-induced tRNA Cleavage—T. thermophila starvation in laboratory culture typically includes deprivation of all organic compounds and metals. To determine whether starvation-induced tRNA cleavage is a response to reduced availability of amino acids specifically, we performed a series of amino acid supplementation experiments. Vegetatively growing cultures were transferred to 10 mm Tris starvation media supplemented with various combinations of amino acids. After 3 h, total RNA was analyzed in bulk by direct staining and for specific tRNAs by Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 5). We found that cleavage was inhibited by the addition of all amino acids or just the essential amino acids (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 4 and 6). In contrast, in the presence of only nonessential amino acids, cleavage appeared to occur at a level similar to cleavage in the absence of all amino acids (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 2 and 7). The absence of an essential amino acid should not affect the uptake of other available amino acids in T. thermophila (39Campbell J.M. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4691-4697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that omission of even a single essential amino acid from supplemented media was sufficient to induce cleavage of cognate and non-cognate tRNAs at a low level, but the presence of a single essential amino acid failed to protect cognate and non-cognate tRNAs from being cleaved (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 6 and 7; additional data not shown). Together, these findings suggest that tRNA cleavage occurs in response to limitation for an essential amino acid. Cleavage of tRNA Can Be Regulated Independently of Other Starvation Responses—We speculated that tRNA cleavage could be influenced by the rate of translation, if limited amino acid availability is signaled by ribosome stalling. To investigate whether ribosome stalling is sufficient to trigger tRNA cleavage, vegetatively growing cells were transferred to 10 mm Tris either with or without the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The tRNA halves did not accumulate if starvation occurred in the presence of cycloheximide, with or without essential amino acids present, although a significantly smaller 3′ tRNA fragment was detected under both conditions (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 5). We suggest that the process of translation is required to induce anticodon loop cleavage of tRNAs as well as the starvation response in general, because cycloheximide also blocked starvation-induced accumulation of the noncoding RNA G8 (Fig. 5A) and characteristic starvation-associated morphological changes (17Nelsen E.M. Dev. Biol. 1978; 66: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Starvation plays a crucial role in T. thermophila biology, as it is required for cells to acquire mating competence (40Wellnitz W.R. Bruns P.J. Exp. Cell. Res. 1979; 119: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In 10 mm Tris, the requisite period of starvation for “initiation” into the mating pathway is at least 75 min. Starvation is uncoupled from initiation in 50 mm Tris, which induces a starvation response but blocks cells before initiation is complete. Under this condition of starvation, the degradation of rRNA and proteins still occurs (18Sutton C.A. Hallberg R.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 101: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and G8 RNA was induced (Fig. 5A, lane 8, bottom), but tRNA cleavage was prevented (Fig. 5A, lane 8, top). These results suggest that the induction of anticodon loop cleavage of tRNAs is coordinated with life cycle progression, rather than occurring solely in response to the absence of essential amino acids. In our analyses of small noncoding RNAs in T. thermophila, we have discovered a previously unidentified response to amino acid starvation: cleavage of tRNAs in the anticodon loop (and/or extended variable stem-loop). During vegetative growth, T. thermophila maintains abundant and highly active machinery for translation in order to double its large cell volume in only 2–3 h (41Collins K. Gorovsky M.A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R317-R318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The abundance of tRNA may have enabled direct observation of tRNA cleavage products during the initial phase of starvation. Cleavage of tRNAs may also occur upon starvation in other organisms but may not have been detected due to incomplete time course analysis, different kinetics of the starvation response, or general RNA breakdown obscuring detection of the tRNA halves. The tRNA halves that accumulate in starving T. thermophila likely represent most, if not all, tRNA sequences. The general absence of terminal CCA residues on the cloned 3′ halves of tRNAs suggests that the tRNAs targeted for cleavage may not be aminoacylated. We found no indication of aminoacylated tRNA halves on acid-urea gels (data not shown), consistent with the idea that tRNAs are deacylated prior to cleavage. In E. coli and yeast, uncharged tRNAs are susceptible to 3′ residue loss, with repair dependent on the CCA-adding tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (38Deutscher M.P. Lin J.J. Evans J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1081-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 42Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2473-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 43Wolfe C.L. Hopper A.K. Martin N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4679-4686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The transient accumulation of a putative 3′ end-truncated tRNA species at early time points in starvation suggests that CCA loss occurs prior to tRNA cleavage. Preferential cleavage of uncharged and 3′ end-truncated tRNAs could explain the lack of increase in deacylated tRNA levels upon amino acid starvation. If uncharged tRNAs have more rapid turnover than charged tRNAs, tRNA cleavage could impact a greater percentage of the total tRNA pool than suggested by the ratio of intact and cleaved tRNA at steady state. Loss of the 3′ terminal CCA could be promoted upon starvation through numerous possible mechanisms. Existing populations of tRNA could be rendered more susceptible to CCA loss due to decreased amino acid availability, reduced tRNA synthetase activity, and/or the activation of nucleases acting at the 3′ end of tRNAs. Indeed, reduced expression of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase has been reported in starved T. thermophila (44Csank C. Martindale D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4592-4599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli and yeast, nucleolytic activity directed at unprotected tRNA 3′ ends increases in non-log phase compared with log phase growth (38Deutscher M.P. Lin J.J. Evans J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1081-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 43Wolfe C.L. Hopper A.K. Martin N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4679-4686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, 3′ end repair of truncated tRNAs could be limited through repression of the CCA-adding enzyme. Our findings indicate that tRNA cleavage occurs only under a subset of starvation conditions. Cleavage of tRNA appeared to be induced upon omission of even a single essential amino acid and was blocked by starvation in either 10 mm Tris supplemented with all essential amino acids or in 50 mm Tris. The inhibition of tRNA cleavage was unlinked to other starvation-induced phenotypes. We suggest that when cells are in environmental conditions suitable for mating, essential amino acid starvation induces a regulatory pathway that targets deacylated tRNAs. As the starvation response progresses and adaptation is achieved through a combination of proteolysis and selective gene expression, either the tRNA cleavage activity is down-regulated or its substrates decrease in abundance. Anticodon loop cleavage of tRNAs has been observed in prokaryotes (45Masaki H. Ogawa T. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 46Kaufmann G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 70-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), yet the nucleases responsible are likely to be distinct from the starvation-induced tRNase activity in T. thermophila we report here. The prokaryotic plasmid-encoded colicins and the anticodon nuclease PrrC target tRNAs for cleavage in the anticodon loop in response to stress-induced signals and T4 phage infection, respectively. However, the prokaryotic nucleases exhibit specificity for certain tRNA species, whereas the starvation-induced tRNA cleavage uncovered and characterized in this study appears to be unrestricted with regard to isoacceptor specificity. Also, tBLASTn searches of the T. thermophila genome did not yield matches of significant homology to the prokaryotic proteins. Thus, to our knowledge, cleavage of tRNAs in response to essential amino acid depletion represents a newly discovered phenomenon. Because only a small fraction of the total tRNA population appears to be targeted for cleavage, it is unlikely that tRNA cleavage inhibits translation overall or that tRNA degradation is needed for the recycling of ribonucleotides. The observed tRNA cleavage could serve as a mechanism to eliminate uncharged and/or 3′-truncated tRNAs, which might otherwise interfere with translational accuracy or efficiency. None of the tRNA halves cloned bore untemplated 3′-adenosine residues, suggesting that if tRNA cleavage reflects a quality control mechanism, it is distinct from the polyadenylation-dependent pathway that degrades aberrant tRNAs (5Vanacova S. Wolf J. Martin G. Blank D. Dettwiler S. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keith G. Keller W. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: 986-997Crossref Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 6Kadaba S. Krueger A. Trice T. Krecic A.M.

Cell. 2005; 121: 713-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that tRNA cleavage limits uncharged tRNA function as a signaling molecule. Activation of Gcn2p kinase by uncharged tRNA leads to a general repression of translation due to phosphorylation of eIF2, which in turn promotes the selective expression of genes required for adaptation to amino acid starvation (12Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Predicted GCN2 homologues are evident in the sequenced T. thermophila genome (www.ciliate.org), indicating that activation of a Gcn2p ortholog could occur during starvation. Targeting uncharged tRNA for degradation may thus promote progression from an initial starvation adjustment phase to an adapted state competent for mating or longer term survival under nutrient-poor conditions. In conclusion, we have identified a novel response to essential amino acid starvation in the ciliate T. thermophila in which tRNAs are cleaved in the anticodon loop. It remains to be determined whether this type of tRNA cleavage is ciliate-specific or more broadly conserved. E. coli strains lacking the CCA-adding enzyme show an apparent reduction in 3′-truncated tRNAs during non-log phase growth, leading to the suggestion that an unknown degradation mechanism limits the accumulation of uncharged, 3′-truncated tRNAs (38Deutscher M.P. Lin J.J. Evans J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 1081-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In yeast, truncated tRNAs do accumulate in strains with reduced cytosolic CCA repair activity (43Wolfe C.L. Hopper A.K. Martin N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4679-4686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); it is unknown whether a fraction of the shortened tRNAs undergo degradation similar to that described in this report. Further insight into the mechanism and significance of T. thermophila tRNase activity will be facilitated by complete sequencing of the genome, ongoing annotation, and the application of genomic tools to study the physiological response to amino acid starvation.

The voltage sensitivity of these channels arises from the motion of charged arginine residues located on the S4 helices of the channel’s voltage sensors. In KvAP, a prokaryotic voltage-dependent K+ channel, the S4 helix forms part of a helical hairpin structure, the voltage-sensor paddle. We have measured the membrane depth of residues throughout the KvAP channel using avidin accessibility to different-length tethered biotin reagents. From these measurements, we have calibrated the tether lengths and derived the thickness of the membrane that forms a barrier to avidin penetration, allowing us to determine the magnitude of displacement of the voltage-sensor paddles during channel gating. Here we show that the voltage-sensor paddles are highly mobile compared to other regions of the channel and transfer the gating-charge arginines 15–20 Å through the membrane to open the pore."

SAGA is targeted to promoters through interactions with sequence-specific DNA binding transcriptional activators and facilitates preinitiation-complex assembly and transcription. Here, we show that the 19S proteasome regulatory particle (19S RP) alters SAGA to stimulate its interaction with transcriptional activators. The ATPase components of the 19S RP are required for stimulation of SAGA/activator interactions and enhance SAGA recruitment to promoters. Proteasomal ATPases genetically interact with SAGA, and their inhibition reduces global histone H3 acetylation levels and SAGA recruitment to target promoters in vivo. These results indicate that the 19S RP modulates SAGA complex using its ATPase components, thereby facilitating subsequent transcription events at promoters."

https://openalex.org/W2120496470,"In previous studies examining the structural determinants of antidepressant and substrate recognition by serotonin transporters (SERTs), we identified Tyr-95 in transmembrane segment 1 (TM1) of human SERT as a major determinant of binding for several antagonists, including racemic citalopram ((RS)-CIT). Here we described a separate site in hSERT TM3 (Ile-172) that impacts (RS)-CIT recognition when switched to the corresponding Drosophila SERT residue (I172M). The hSERT I172M mutant displays a marked loss of inhibitor potency for multiple inhibitors such as (RS)-CIT, clomipramine, RTI-55, fluoxetine, cocaine, nisoxetine, mazindol, and nomifensine, whereas recognition of substrates, including serotonin and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, is unaffected. Selectivity for antagonist interactions is evident with this substitution because the potencies of the antidepressants tianeptine and paroxetine are unchanged. Reduced cocaine analog recognition was verified in photoaffinity labeling studies using [125I]MFZ 2-24. In contrast to the I172M substitution, other substitutions at this position significantly affected substrate recognition and/or transport activity. Additionally, the mouse mutation (mSERT I172M) exhibits similar selective changes in inhibitor potency. Unlike hSERT or mSERT, analogous substitutions in mouse dopamine transporter (V152M) or human norepinephrine transporter (V148M) result in transporters that bind substrate but are deficient in the subsequent translocation of the substrate. A double mutant hSERT Y95F/I172M had a synergistic impact on (RS)-CIT recognition (∼10,000-fold decrease in (RS)-CIT potency) in the context of normal serotonin recognition. The less active enantiomer (R)-CIT responded to the I172M substitution like (S)-CIT but was relatively insensitive to the Y95F substitution and did not display a synergistic loss at Y95F/I172M. An hSERT mutant with single cysteine substitutions in TM1 and TM3 resulted in formation of a high affinity cadmium metal coordination site, suggesting proximity of these domains in the tertiary structure of SERT. These studies provided evidence for distinct binding sites coordinating SERT antagonists and revealed a close interaction between TM1 and TM3 differentially targeted by stereoisomers of CIT.

Bauman A.L. Moore K.R. Han H. Yang-Feng T. Chang A.S. Ganapathy V. Blakely R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2542-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) and is a major target for treatment of mood disorders, including major depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and obsessive-compulsive disorders (2Barker E.L. Blakely R.D. Bloom F.E. Kupfer D.J. Psychopharmacology: The Fourth Generation of Progress. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1995Google Scholar). Agents that target SERT include tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that block 5HT binding and uptake. Despite its clinical significance, very little is understood concerning the structural aspects of SERT and how they relate to its function and antagonist recognition. The current data predict that SERT proteins are composed of 12 transmembrane-spanning segments, intracellular NH2 and COOH termini and a large second extracellular loop bearing sites for N-linked glycosylation. Additionally, there is growing evidence that SERT forms a homomultimer in the plasma membrane, although most evidence suggests autonomous function of each monomer (3Jess U. Betz H. Schloss P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 44-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 4Kilic F. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3106-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The studies presented here utilize the strength of species variation at the SERT locus to direct our efforts in identification of residues that impact the structural and functional characteristics of the transporter. For example, in previous studies, we found that human and Drosophila SERTs possess distinct differences in recognition of mazindol and citalopram. To investigate these differences, human/Drosophila SERT chimeras were created and resulted in identification of TM1 and eventually a single residue, Tyr-95, as the residue responsible for these potency differences. Additional chimera studies looking at SERT substrates again identified TM1 and residue Tyr-95 as responsible for selective recognition of tryptamine analogs, particularly those with substitutions at the 4- and 7-position. A conserved Asp found in TM1 of all biogenic amine transporters also appears to play a role in substrate recognition and may also impact coupling (5Ramsey I.S. DeFelice L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14475-14482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, we performed a systematic analysis of TM1 of hSERT by using the substituted Cys accessibility method (SCAM) (6Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 7Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These studies implicated TM1 as forming part of an aqueous pore for 5HT permeation. Tyr-95, Asp-98, Gly-100, Asn-101, and Trp-103 appeared to form a critical stripe of amino acids that could be protected from MTS inactivation by 5HT co-incubation. Additional analyses revealed that aqueous accessibility of TM1 was lost at Val-97, a feature consistent with the cytoplasmic end of this domain contributing to an occluded pore. Together, these data strongly implicate TM1 of SERT as an important contributor to substrate, ion, and inhibitor interactions. In addition to TM1, TM3 has also been the subject of considerable structure/function studies. SCAM analysis revealed that TM3 plays a role in substrate and inhibitor binding. Specifically, residues Ile-172, Tyr-176, and Ile-179 were suggested to lie on one face of an α-helix with Ile-172 and Tyr-176 proximal to the binding sites for 5HT and cocaine (8Chen J.-G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 45: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition to SCAM analysis, chimera and substitution mutagenesis in TM3 have implicated Met-180 as contributing to antidepressant interactions (9Mortensen O.V. Kristensen A.S. Wiborg O. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Larsen M.B. Elfving B. Wiborg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42147-42156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Given the utility of analysis of species variants in SERT TM1, we examined TM3 for conspicuous changes that might support functional differences between Drosophila and human orthologs. We established a substitution of Met for Ile at TM3 172 within the region previously ascribed as contributing to substrate/antagonist recognition. We found that the hSERT I172M substitution has a dramatic impact on the potencies of many SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and cocaine yet no impact on substrate recognition or translocation properties. Further characterization of I172M in the context of the Y95F substitution in TM1 supports the hypothesis that these two sites collaborate to establish high affinity CIT recognition. Moreover, differential recognition at Tyr-95 suggests that it alone is responsible for SERT stereoselective interaction with the R- and S-enantiomers of citalopram. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Construction of Mutant Plasmids—Mutation of hSERT, mDAT, or hNET in pcDNA3.1 to generate the following mutants was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange kit as described previously (11Barker E.L.

Subsequent sequencing (Center for Molecular Neuroscience Neurogenomics and Sequencing Core Facility) confirmed the presence of only the intended mutations. The wild type hSERT and I172M mutant cDNAs were also subcloned into the retroviral vector pBABE (12Morgenstern J.P. Land H.

For initial evaluation of mutant transporter activity, cells were plated at a density of 100,000 cells per well in 24-well culture plates. Cells were transfected with SERT, NET, or DAT constructs with TransIT transfection reagent (Mirus Inc., 6 μl per μg of DNA), also in Opti-MEM medium as described previously (11Barker E.L.

Following transfection (24–48 h), cells were washed with KRH assay buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and assayed for [3H]5-HT (5-hydroxy[3H]tryptamine-trifluoroacetate (121 Ci/mmol); Amersham Biosciences) transport as described previously (7Henry L.K.

DA and NE transport assays were performed as for 5HT except concentrations of 50 nm [3H]DA (3,4-[7-3H]dihydroxyphenylethylamine; 23.5 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or [3H]NE (1-[7,8-3H]noradrenaline; 33 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) were used. Assays maintained linearity under these conditions for up to 15 min. Saturation kinetics for derivation of 5HT Km and Vmax values were established in 24-well plates as described above except serial dilutions (5 to 0.035 μm) of a hot/cold mixture of 5HT with constant specific activity were used. Transport assays were terminated by washing three times with ice-cold assay buffer, and cells were dissolved in MicroScint 20 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) scintillation fluid. Transport assays on stable cells for 5HT or MPP+ uptake were performed 1 day after plating of 20,000 cells in 96-well microwell plates or 100,000 cells in 24-well plates. The extent of [3H]5-HT or [3H]MPP+ ([3H]MPP+ (N-methyl-[3H]4-phenylpyridinium, acetate; 80 Ci/mmol) PerkinElmer Life Sciences; diluted to 0.1% with nonradioactive MPP+) accumulation was determined by liquid scintillation counting on a TopCount System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Uptake in mock-transfected cells was subtracted from transporter-transfected cells to determine specific uptake. Nontransfected cells exhibited comparable uptake to assays performed in the presence of 1 μm paroxetine, 1 μm RTI-55, or 100 nm cocaine. Km and Vmax values obtained from evaluation of transport activity were derived using a nonlinear curve fit as a function of 5HT concentration (40 nm to 5 μm) (Prism 4 for Mac, Graphpad Software). All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated in three or more separate assays. Western Blot and Surface Expression Analysis—To determine total and surface expression of hSERT, mDAT, and hNET constructs, HeLa cells were plated in 24- or 12-well dishes at 100,000 or 500,000 cells per well and transfected 18–24 h later as detailed above. Seventy two hours after transfection, the cell surface proteins were biotinylated and analyzed by Western blot as described previously (7Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol.

Competition Binding Assays—HEK-293 cells stably expressing hSERT or hSERT I172M or HEK-293T cells transiently transfected with hNET and mDAT constructs were grown to confluency in 150 × 25-mm tissue culture-treated Petri plates. Medium was aspirated from cells, and cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to detach from the plate and transferred to 50-ml conical tubes. Following low speed centrifugation, 700 × g, in a table top clinical centrifuge, supernatant was aspirated, and cells were resuspended in ice-cold TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) for cell disruption. The suspension was subjected to 20 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer to disrupt intact cells. Homogenate was transferred to cold 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min (Sorvall Discovery M150 centrifuge). Supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in chilled binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl). A portion of each sample was quantitated for protein content. For hSERT studies, [phenyl-6′-3H]paroxetine (paroxetine; 19 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (1.5 nm final) and cold competitor were combined in 12 × 75-mm borosilicate glass tubes. For hNET and mDAT studies, [125I]RTI-55 (2200 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (0.5 nm final concentration) and cold competitor were combined in 12 × 75 mm borosilicate glass tubes. Binding buffer and membrane suspension were added, and tubes were gently mixed and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. Samples were processed as described previously (7Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Data resulting from hSERT studies were analyzed by using one-site competition binding parameters on Prism 4 (Graphpad) to calculate Ki values. Data from hNET and mDAT studies were expressed as femtomoles of RTI-55 bound and plotted using Prism 4. 5HT Uptake Blockade by Cadmium in Cysteine Mutants—Assays were performed as listed above for transport measurements except that cells were incubated for 10 min with the indicated concentrations of CdCl followed by addition of [3H]5-HT. Cell-incorporated label was determined by scintillation counting as detailed above. Counts were normalized to percentage of 5HT uptake with control and plotted versus cadmium concentration. Photoaffinity Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—LLC-PK1 cells expressing rDAT and HEK-293 cells expressing hSERT or I172M hSERT were grown to 70% confluency in 6-well plates. Medium was removed, and 1 ml of [125I]MFZ 2-24 prepared in KRH buffer was added to a final concentration of 5 nm for 1 h at room temperature. For pharmacological studies, nonradioactive transporter ligands were included in the binding mixture at 1 μm final concentration. Cells were irradiated with shortwave ultraviolet light (254 nm, Fotodyne UV Lamp model 3-6000) for 45 s at a distance of 15–20 mm to photoactivate the radioligand. Complete medium for HEK-293 cells or LLC-PK1 medium (α-minimum essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) for LLC-PK1 cells was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold KRH buffer.

Multiple Sequence Alignment of TM3 from Various SERT Orthologs and Construction of hSERT I172M Mutant—Based on our previous work indicating that (RS)-CIT and mazindol potency differences between Drosophila and human SERT were localized to TM1 and TM3 (11Barker E.L.

A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we sought evidence for divergent residues in TM3 that contribute to species-specific ligand recognition. The amino acid sequences of TM3 of SERT from various organisms were compared using the Megalign module within the DNAstar program (Lasergene, Inc.) (Fig. 1). An alignment of TM3 of SERT from various organisms illustrates the high degree of amino acid identity present in TM3. Although the majority of SERTs we sampled have an Ile at the position homologous to Ile-172 in hSERT, a subset of insect species consisting of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly, Diptera), Anophelese gambiae (mosquito, Diptera), and Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm, Lepidoptera) contain a Met at this position. Based on previous suggestions that Ile-172 in hSERT participates in both substrate and antagonist interactions (8Chen J.-G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 45: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we proceeded to investigate the impact of Ile substitution with Met at this position in hSERT. The function of the hSERT I172M mutant construct was initially compared with hSERT using radiolabeled 5HT uptake and Western blot techniques with transiently transfected HeLa cells. Single time point uptake analyses revealed that both hSERT and mutant exhibited equivalent levels of [3H]5-HT uptake (10 min, 20 nm) (Fig. 2A). Kinetic measurements of [3H]5-HT uptake confirm indistinguishable rates of uptake between the hSERT WT and I172M (Fig. 2B). Consistent with these data, Western blot analyses of whole cell lysates from transiently transfected HeLa cells reveal the presence of relatively similar amounts of mature and immature SERT protein from hSERT or I172M (Fig. 2C). Saturation binding analysis of [3H]paroxetine revealed comparable Kd values between mutant and wild type hSERT (0.4 versus 0.7 nm), data not shown.FIGURE 2Analysis of hSERT I172M mutant function. A, relative activity of hSERT I172M was compared with wild type hSERT by determining the amount of radiolabeled 5HT transported into cells during a 10-min incubation. The data were normalized to the activity of the wild type. B, saturation uptake analysis of SERT wild type and I172M mutant. HeLa cells transiently expressing wild type or I172M substituted SERT were monitored for uptake of radio-labeled 5HT. The resulting counts were converted to femtomoles/cell/min and plotted versus 5HT concentration that ranged from 0 to 5 μm. The data were fit to a Michaelis-Menten nonlinear regression curve using Prism 4.0 for Mac (Graphpad) C, analysis of expression levels of the I172M substitution. HeLa cells transiently expressing wild type or I172M were evaluated for SERT expression by Western blot analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” Nontransfected cells served as a negative control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of I172M on Potency of Substrates and Inhibitory Compounds—To evaluate the pharmacological consequences of the I172M mutation, the IC50 values for [3H]5-HT uptake inhibition for various neurotransmitter substrates and inhibitors were determined. All the substrates tested displayed little or no change in their ability to compete for uptake of 5HT in hSERT versus I172M mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Similarly, the Km values (14 μm WT versus 12 μm I172M) for transport of the neurotoxic substrate MPP+ did not change with the Ile to Met substitution. Most surprisingly, more than half of the nontransported inhibitors of SERT showed decreases in potency in the I172M background ranging from 9-fold for mazindol to >1000-fold loss for (RS)-CIT. Additionally, cocaine and its structural analog RTI-55 displayed 69- and 178-fold losses in potency, respectively. Most interestingly, a few compounds like the SSRI paroxetine and the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline exhibited less than a 2.5-fold change in potency.TABLE 1Impact of hSERT I172M mutant on 5HT uptake inhibition constants for SERT substrates and inhibitorsCompoundhSERT Ki (m)hSERT I172M Ki (m)Fold ΔSubstrates5HT1.8 × 10-7 ± 0.301.8 × 10-7 ± 0.201.0tryptamine2.0 × 10-7 ± 0.092.0 × 10-7 ± 0.051.04HT6.8 × 10-6 ± 0.805.8 × 10-6 ± 0.500.9α-MST1.2 × 10-6 ± 0.501.4 × 10-6 ± 0.701.15H7MT2.1 × 10-6 ± 0.201.5 × 10-6 ± 0.200.7MDMAaThe following abbreviations are used: MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; 5MIT,s 5-methoxyindoletryptamine.5.2 × 10-4 ± 1.506.5 × 10-4 ± 1.001.35MITaThe following abbreviations are used: MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; 5MIT,s 5-methoxyindoletryptamine.4.2 × 10-2 ± 1.803.3 × 10-2 ± 1.400.8RU-249694.3 × 10-7 ± 0.049.8 × 10-7 ± 0.102.3MPP+7.0 × 10-4 ± 0.102.0 × 10-4 ± 0.010.37HT2.8 × 10-6 ± 0.207.4 × 10-7 ± 1.100.3Inhibitorstianeptine3.2 × 10-6 ± 0.802.8 × 10-6 ± 0.200.9amitriptyline7.6 × 10-8 ± 2.004.8 × 10-8 ± 1.501.6paroxetine5.5 × 10-10 ± 0.901.1 × 10-9 ± 0.032.1nomifensene3.3 × 10-6 ± 1.401.1 × 10-5 ± 0.503.3mazindol3.2 × 10-7 ± 1.202.8 × 10-6 ± 0.208.8(RS)-fluoxetine6.7 × 10-9 ± 1.202.0 × 10-7 ± 0.2029.9sertraline4.9 × 10-9 ± 0.501.6 × 10-7 ± 0.0732.7cocaine7.4 × 10-7 ± 2.605.1 × 10-5 ± 0.7068.6(R)-citalopram1.8 × 10-7 ± 0.902.2 × 10-5 ± 0.40120clomipramine2.3 × 10-9 ± 0.403.6 × 10-7 ± 1.70157RTI-556.5 × 10-10 ± 2.101.2 × 10-7 ± 0.05178(S)-citalopram1.3 × 10-9 ± 0.901.0 × 10-6 ± 0.50752(RS)-citalopram4.5 × 10-9 ± 0.905.6 × 10-6 ± 2.101240a The following abbreviations are used: MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; 5MIT,s 5-methoxyindoletryptamine. Open table in a new tab Reciprocal Mutation of the Ile-172 Homologous Residue Met-167 in dSERT to Ile Results in a Gain of Function Phenotype in Regard to Inhibitor Potency—To validate the unique ability of the I172M substitution to impact inhibitor potencies to such a large degree, the same mutagenesis methods described earlier were employed to convert the dSERT residue Met at position 167 (homologous to Ile-172 in hSERT) to Ile. The mutant was then evaluated by [3H]5-HT competition uptake assays with either unlabeled 5HT or antagonists. As seen in the hSERT I172M mutation, 5HT (2.9 → 3.1 μm) and paroxetine (26 → 9.7 nm) potencies showed little to no change in the dSERT M167I background (Fig. 3, bottom). However, cocaine (22 → 0.37 μm), fluoxetine (840 → 25 nm), and (RS)-citalopram (400 → 9.3 nm) showed marked increases in potency in the mutant dSERT compared with native dSERT. Characterization of I172M Substitution in Mouse SERT—We wanted to extend the analysis to rodent SERTs to determine whether the impact of the substitution was compatible with future in vivo manipulations in a murine model. To evaluate this idea, we expressed mSERT I172M in HeLa cells and performed competition uptake studies. The compounds tested yielded results that were strikingly comparable with those seen with the hSERT mutant (Table 2). As with the hSERT mutant, none of the substrates tested were impacted by Met substitution. Potency losses for (RS)-CIT and fluoxetine were comparable with those seen in hSERT. Most interestingly, clomipramine exhibited a 10-fold greater loss in potency in mSERT compared with hSERT, suggesting somewhat distinct conformations or binding contacts for tricyclics at hSERT versus mSERT.TABLE 2Impact of mSERT I172M mutant on 5HT uptake inhibition constants for SERT substrates and inhibitorsCompoundmSERT Ki (m)mSERT I172M Ki (m)Fold Δ5HT9.30 × 10-7 ± 0.81.20 × 10-6 ± 0.615MT3.23 × 10-5 ± 3.34.73 × 10-5 ± 1.61tyramine1.20 × 10-4 ± 0.37.80 × 10-5 ± 0.51(RS)-fluoxetine4.20 × 10-8 ± 2.91.80 × 10-6 ± 0.643(RS)-citalopram5.00 × 10-9 ± 0.26.85 × 10-6 ± 1.51370clomipramine6.15 × 10-10 ± 5.39.45 × 10-7 ± 3.61537 Open table in a new tab Competitive Binding Analysis of the hSERT I172M Mutation Yields Similar Results as Competitive Uptake Assays—Loss of antagonist recognition at the I172M substitution could arise from a modification of ligand-binding sites or be indirect via long range conformational perturbations linked to transport. Therefore, we wanted to confirm that loss of potency with the I172M substitution reflects a concomitant loss of binding affinity, and thus we employed [3H]paroxetine competitive binding assays (Table 3). [3H]Paroxetine was used to label SERT as the SSRI showed little to no change in apparent Ki values for either hSERT or I172M SERT (Fig. 3). Our results revealed binding trends similar to those observed with the uptake inhibition studies. For instance, (S)-CIT, which showed a 750-fold loss in potency for the I172M mutant, exhibited a comparable 1000-fold reduction in potency for displacement of [3H]paroxetine binding for I172M versus hSERT. Similarly, (R)-CIT (120-versus 58-fold), cocaine (69-versus 39-fold), and clomipramine (157-versus 276-fold) showed comparable fold loss values for inhibition of 5HT uptake and paroxetine binding comparing hSERT and the I172M mutant. One exception was amitriptyline, whose potency for 5HT inhibition was unaffected by the Met substitution but showed a modest 80-fold loss in potency for [3H]paroxetine binding.TABLE 3Impact of hSERT I172M on inhibition constants for competition of [3H]paroxetine bindingCompound"

Intercellular communication by gap junctions, slow electrical potentials, action potentials initiated in dendrites, neuromodulatory effects, extrasynaptic release of neurotransmitters, and information flow between neurons and glia all contribute to information processing. Revisiting the Neuron Doctrine suggests that future research outside its limits may lead to new insights into the unique capabilities of the human brain.

Here we show that testis-specific TAF (TBP-associated factor) homologs required for terminal differentiation of male germ cells may activate target gene expression in part by counteracting repression by Polycomb . Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that testis TAFs bind to target promoters, reduce Polycomb binding, and promote local accumulation of H3K4me3, a mark of Trithorax action. Testis TAFs also promoted relocalization of Polycomb Repression Complex 1 components to the nucleolus in spermatocytes, implicating subnuclear architecture in the regulation of terminal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2105988430,"The molecular pathways involved in retrograde signal transduction at synapses and the function of retrograde communication are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that postsynaptic calcium 2+ ion (Ca2+) influx through glutamate receptors and subsequent postsynaptic vesicle fusion trigger a robust induction of presynaptic miniature release after high-frequency stimulation at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions. An isoform of the synaptotagmin family, synaptotagmin 4 (Syt 4), serves as a postsynaptic Ca2+ sensor to release retrograde signals that stimulate enhanced presynaptic function through activation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway. Postsynaptic Ca2+ influx also stimulates local synaptic differentiation and growth through Syt 4-mediated retrograde signals in a synapse-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2156812020,"Hepatic gluconeogenesis is essential for maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting and is the major contributor to postprandial and fasting hyperglycemia in diabetes. Gluconeogenesis is a classic cAMP/protein kinase A-dependent process initiated by glucagon, which is elevated in the blood during fasting and in diabetes. In this study, we have shown that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) was activated in liver by fasting and in primary hepatocytes by glucagon or forskolin. Fasting plasma glucose levels were reduced upon blockade of p38 with either a chemical inhibitor or small interference RNA in mice. In examining the mechanism, inhibition of p38 suppressed gluconeogenesis in liver, along with expression of key gluconeogenic genes, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha and cAMP-response element-binding protein have been shown to be important mediators of hepatic gluconeogenesis. We have shown that inhibition of p38 prevented transcription of the PPARgamma coactivator 1alpha gene as well as phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein. Together, our results from in vitro and in vivo studies define a model in which cAMP-dependent activation of genes involved in gluconeogenesis is dependent upon the p38 pathway, thus adding a new player to our evolving understanding of this physiology."

Mitochondria form a complex reticular structure that is maintained by a balance between ongoing mitochondrial division and fusion events (1Nunnari J. Marshall W. Straight A. Murray A. Sedat J.W.

In contrast, disruption of mitochondrial division causes simple tubules to form highly interconnected net-like structures (3Bleazard W. McCaffery J.M. King E.J. Bale S. Mozdy A. Tieu Q. Nunnari J.

Numerous studies have established that the human orthologs of these components also function to regulate mitochondrial dynamics, indicating that the fundamental mechanisms underlying these events are conserved (9Chen H. Chan D.C. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2004; 59: 119-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there is increasing evidence suggesting that in human cells mitochondrial division and fusion components have been co-opted to regulate apoptosis (10Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 298-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Existing experimental evidence indicates that the yeast dynamin-related protein, Dnm1, is the master regulator of mitochondrial division. Dnm1 self-assembles and in vivo exists at steady state in punctate structures associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane, often at points of membrane constriction and fission (3Bleazard W. McCaffery J.M. King E.J. Bale S. Mozdy A. Tieu Q. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 4Sesaki H. Jensen R.E. J.

Cell. 2003; 14: 1953-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical and structural analysis of pure Dnm1 indicates that Dnm1 self-assembly functions to drive the membrane constriction and fission events associated with mitochondrial division (13Ingerman E. Perkins E.M. Marino M. Mears J.A. McCaffery J.M. Hinshaw J.E. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Specifically, Dnm1 forms extended spirals, which possess diameters greater than dynamin-1 spirals, but which are, remarkably, equal to diameters of mitochondrial constriction sites in vivo. Dnm1 self-assembly proceeds through a rate-limiting nucleation step and nucleotide hydrolysis by assembled Dnm1 structures is highly cooperative with respect to GTP (13Ingerman E. Perkins E.M. Marino M. Mears J.A. McCaffery J.M. Hinshaw J.E. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). These kinetic features of Dnm1 suggest that the key rate-limiting event in division is the regulation of Dnm1 self-assembly. In yeast, two additional components, Fis1 and Mdv1, are required and function together with Dnm1 in mitochondrial division (5Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 178-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Fis1 is a highly conserved C-tail anchored outer membrane protein comprised largely of a cytosolic superhelical tetratricopeptide repeat domain (14Suzuki M. Neutzner A. Tjandra N. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21444-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). An interaction of the human ortholog, hFis1, with the human Dnm1 ortholog, Drp1, has been reported, but the role of this interaction in division is unknown (15Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5409-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). To date, however, no interaction between Fis1 and Dnm1 has been detected, raising the possibility it is labile or not essential in yeast. In yeast, the most well defined role of Fis1 is as a mitochondrial receptor for Mdv1, where the Fis1·Mdv1 complex functions to trigger division (16Tieu Q. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 17Tieu Q. Okreglak V. Naylor K. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Mdv1 is a multidomain protein containing three major regions, an N-terminal extension of unknown structure (NTE), 3The abbreviations used are: NTE, N-terminal extension; C-C, coiled-coil; WD, WD repeat β-propeller; SD, synthetic media with dextrose; S-Raf, synthetic media with raffinose; S-Gal, synthetic media with galactose; mito, mitochondrial targeting sequence; EM, electron microscopy; GMP-PCP, guanylyl 5′-(β,γ-methylenediphosphonate); GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; dsRed, red fluorescent protein from Discoma sp. 3The abbreviations used are: NTE, N-terminal extension; C-C, coiled-coil; WD, WD repeat β-propeller; SD, synthetic media with dextrose; S-Raf, synthetic media with raffinose; S-Gal, synthetic media with galactose; mito, mitochondrial targeting sequence; EM, electron microscopy; GMP-PCP, guanylyl 5′-(β,γ-methylenediphosphonate); GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; dsRed, red fluorescent protein from Discoma sp. a central predicted coiled-coil (C-C), and a C-terminal WD repeat (WD), predicted to form a seven-bladed propeller. Previous two-hybrid and cytological observations indicate that the Mdv1 NTE mediates an interaction with Fis1, the Mdv1WD mediates the interaction with Dnm1, and the central Mdv1 C-C mediates homo-oligomer formation (17Tieu Q. Okreglak V. Naylor K. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The WD is both necessary and sufficient for Mdv1 to interact with Dnm1 punctate structures (17Tieu Q. Okreglak V. Naylor K. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 18Cerveny K.L. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4126-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, Mdv1 functions as an adaptor linking Fis1 with Dnm1 during division. Yeast cells possess a close Mdv1 structural homolog, Caf4, which also interacts and forms a complex with Fis1 (19Griffin E.E. Graumann J. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the absence of Mdv1, a Fis1·Caf4 complex targets Dnm1 to the membrane; however, the Fis1·Caf4 complex only supports minimal division activity. Consistent with this, in cells lacking Caf4, mitochondrial morphology is reticular and indistinguishable from that of wild type. In cells lacking both Mdv1 and Caf4, Dnm1 is not stably targeted to mitochondria, an identical phenotype to fis1-Δ cells. Thus, Fis1 targets Dnm1 to mitochondria only through its ability to interact with either Mdv1 or Caf4. Analysis of Mdv1 indicating that it functions as a linker between Fis1 and Dnm1 supports this conclusion (17Tieu Q. Okreglak V. Naylor K. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The role of the Caf4·Fis1 complex in mitochondrial division is unknown at present, but it is clearly dispensable and most likely regulatory. In this report, we further examine the role that Mdv1 plays in mitochondrial division subsequent to Dnm1 targeting. Our analysis suggests that Mdv1 interacts with Dnm1 only when it is self-assembled into GTP-dependent ring-like structures and not when it exists as extended filaments, which form in the absence of GTP. We also show that the Mdv1 WD domain plays both regulatory and structural roles in division via its interaction with Dnm1 and indicates that membrane division requires a dynamic Mdv1/Dnm1 interaction. We postulate that the critical activity of Mdv1 in division is to promote the assembly of Dnm1 into a division competent spiral-like structure.

Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab Standard genetic techniques and yeast media, including yeast extract peptone glycerol (3% glycerol), SD, S-Raf (2% raffinose), and S-Gal (2% galactose), were prepared as previously described (20Guthrie C. Fink G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-933PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were performed as previously described (21Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). Plasmids—A plasmid containing GAL-regulated MDV1 was constructed by inserting the KpnI-SacI piece of p416GALL (American Type Culture Collection) containing the GALL promoter and MCS into pRS314 to create p414GALL. GFP-MDV1 was removed from p416GALL-MDV1 (17Tieu Q. Okreglak V. Naylor K. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) by SpeI and XhoI digest and inserted in p414GALL resulting in p414GALL-GFP-MDV1. p416GALL-dsRed/dimer2-MDV1 was created by ligating MDV1 into p416GALL (American Type Culture Collection) using BamHI and EcoRI sites. EcoRI and BamHI sites were introduced by PCR amplification of the MDV1 open reading frame and this construct was ligated into p416GALL resulting in p416GALLMDV1. XbaI and BamHI sites were introduced into the dsRed/dimer2 open reading frame by PCR amplification (22Campbell R. Tour O. Palmer A. Steinbach P. Baird G. Zacharius D. Tsien R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). This construct was ligated into p416GALL-MDV1 resulting in p416GALL-dsRed/dimer2-MDV1. A mitochondrial targeted dsRedT1 was created by removing GFP from VT100U-mitoGFP (23Westermann B. Neupert W. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) by KpnI-NotI digest, blunting the KpnI site in the vector backbone with Vent polymerase, dsRed.TI (24Bevis B.J. Glick B.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) was inserted creating a mitochondrially targeted dsRedT1. A mitochondrial targeted CFP was created by removing GFP from pYX223-mitoGFP (23Westermann B. Neupert W. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) by SmaI digest and replacing it with CFP, which was PCR amplified from pDH3 obtained from the Yeast Resource Center, resulting in pYX223mitoCFP. Generation of Mdv1 and Dnm1 Mutants—Site-directed mutations were created using a complementary primer PCR method (QuikChange® kit, Invitrogen). Primers 40-60 bases in length were constructed with 20-30 nucleotides on either side of the altered nucleotide(s) and were purified by polyacrylamide gel as described (25Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983Google Scholar). Whole plasmid amplification was performed and PCR products were digested with DpnI for 2 h at 37°C to remove template DNA. The amplified plasmid DNA was transformed into DH5α cells. Plasmid DNA was isolated from selected colonies and sequenced to confirm mutations. Expression of mutant proteins was determined by Western analysis using anti-Mdv1 and anti-Dnm1 antibodies (11Otsuga D. Keegan B.R. Brisch E. Thantcher J.W. Hermann G.J. Bleazard W. Shaw J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 16Tieu Q. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). All Mdv1 and Dnm1 mutant proteins used in this study were determined to be stable and expressed at levels similar to wild type protein. All mutants were analyzed under conditions where expression levels were similar to chromosomal wild type protein levels with the exception of Mdv1 mutants expressed under the GALL promoter, where levels were ∼10-20-fold higher (data not shown). Random mutagenesis was performed using mutagenic PCR conditions to amplify nucleotides 1-687 of MDV1 and the resultant PCR products were used as megaprimers for whole plasmid amplification (26Miyazaki K. Takenouchi M. BioTechniques. 2002; 33 (1036-1038): 1033-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Whole plasmid PCR products were transformed into DH5α cells to create a DNA library. Mdv1 mutants were screened and identified by their inability to rescue the glycerol growth defect in mdv1-Δ cells harboring the temperature-sensitive fusion mutant fzo1-1 (16Tieu Q. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Potential mutants were tested for Mdv1 expression by Western analysis and sequenced before further analysis. Dnm1 Purification and Electron Microscopy—Both procedures were performed as previously described (13Ingerman E. Perkins E.M. Marino M. Mears J.A. McCaffery J.M. Hinshaw J.E. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). GTPase Assay—A GTPase assay in which substrate was continuously regenerated and GTPase activity measured continuously was performed as previously described (13Ingerman E. Perkins E.M. Marino M. Mears J.A. McCaffery J.M. Hinshaw J.E. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in 25 mm HEPES, 25 mm PIPES, pH 7, 110 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 7.5 mm KCl, 160 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phospho(enol)pyruvate, 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase, 600 μm NADH, 5.5% Me2SO, and 250 μm GTP. In each reaction, the concentration of wild type Dnm1 was 0.048 mg/ml (0.55 μm). To assess the effect of mutants Dnm1K41A, Dnm1S42N, and Dnm1T62D/F on wild type Dnm1 GTPase activity, increasing amounts of each mutant were added to wild type Dnm1. Increasing concentrations of each of the mutant proteins, contained in a 40-μl volume of freezing buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20 mm PIPES, pH 7, 400 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 400 mm NaCl, 20% Me2SO), were preincubated with 10 μg of wild type Dnm1. GTPase assay reactions were started by the addition of reaction buffer to the preincubated proteins. All GTPase assay reactions were performed in 200-μl volumes, of which 150 μl was placed into wells of a 96-well plate. Depletion of NADH over time was measured for a duration of 40 min using a SpectraMAX 250 96-well plate reader (Molecular Devices). Spectrophotometric data were transferred to Excel and the measured depletion of NADH over time was converted to a protein activity. GTP Binding Assay—GTP binding assays were performed in 25 mm HEPES, 25 mm PIPES, pH 7, 90 mm NaCl, 60 mm imidazole, 0.5 μm [α-32P]GTP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2. Approximately 2.3 μg of protein was added to the GTP binding buffer in a 20-μl reaction volume. After incubating at room temperature for 5 min, the reactions were placed directly onto parafilm that was resting on top of the ice. The reactions were irradiated in a Spectrolinker XL-1500 (Spectrontics Corp.) at 254 nm for 300 s, ∼10 cm from the UV source. After cross-linking, 15 μl of each cross-linked reaction were placed into tubes containing 5 μl of 4× sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie, destained, dried onto Whatman paper, and wrapped in plastic. A phosphorscreen was exposed to the dried gel and scanned using a Storm system (Amersham Biosciences). Two-hybrid Analysis—Full-length MDV1, 1-2142 nucleotides, or the WD region, 903-2142 nucleotides, were PCR amplified, introducing EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites, and ligated into pGAD and pGBDU to create pGAD-MDV1, pGAD-WD, pGBDU-MDV1, and pGBDU-WD (27James P. Halladay J. Craig E.E. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pGAD-FIS1tr and pGBDU-FIS1tr were created by ligation of PCR-amplified FIS11-381 nucleotides with introduced BamHI and SalI restriction sites into pGAD and pGBDU. pGADDNM1 and pGBDU-DNM1 were created by removing DNM1 from pRU23BD-DNM1 (28Fukushima N.H. Brisch E. Keegan B.R. Bleazard W. Shaw J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2756-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and ligating it into pGAD and pGBDU using BamHI and SalI sites. For two-hybrid analysis, plasmids constructed as described above for pGBDU and pGAD were co-transformed into the yeast strain PJ69-4A and tested for interactions as previously described (27James P. Halladay J. Craig E.E. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytological Analysis—Mitochondrial morphology was visualized using mito-dsRed or mito-CFP, created as described above. Dnm1-GFP was visualized by transforming cells with pHS20 as previously described (16Tieu Q. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 17Tieu Q. Okreglak V. Naylor K. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Mdv1 was visualized by transforming cells with p414GALL-GFP-MDV1. To analyze Mdv1 and Dnm1 together, cells were transformed with pHS20 and p416GALL-dsRed/dimer2-MDV1. Transformants were grown in SD, subcultured into S-Raf media, further subcultured into S-Gal to induce expression of dsRed-tagged Mdv1 and mito-CFP, or supplemented with 1% dextrose to induce expression of GFP-tagged Mdv1, and imaged after 12 h of logarithmic growth. Cells were concentrated and mounted in 1.5% low melt agarose. All samples were imaged using a DeltaVision microscope with either a 100× 1.4 NA or 60× 1.4 NA objective. Step size of 0.2 μm was used for fixed time point analyses. For time-lapse analysis a single 0.2-μm section was imaged. Quantification and localization of Mdv1 puncta was performed using Volocity software to analyze movies of single yeast cell sections of mdv1-Δ strains expressing GFP-Mdv1 and GFPMdv1N544R. Mdv1 and Dnm1 mutants were determined to complement the respective null strains by the recovery of net-like mitochondria to reticular structures upon expression of Mdv1 and Dnm1 mutant alleles. Dominant negative phenotypes were determined by the interference of Mdv1 and Dnm1 mutants with wild type proteins as observed by the formation of nets upon the expression of the mutant alleles in an otherwise wild type background. Mdv1 Is Present in the Division Complex during Division—Previously it has been shown by fixed time point analysis that Dnm1 is found in punctate structures associated with mitochondria and at mitochondrial constriction sites in cells (3Bleazard W. McCaffery J.M. King E.J. Bale S. Mozdy A. Tieu Q. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 4Sesaki H. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 11Otsuga D. Keegan B.R. Brisch E. Thantcher J.W. Hermann G.J. Bleazard W. Shaw J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). More recently, time-lapse analysis has shown that Dnm1 puncta are associated at sites of mitochondrial division in vivo (12Legesse-Miller A. Massol R.H. Kirchhausen T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1953-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We have also characterized the behavior of Dnm1 and mitochondria in wild type cells using time-lapse microscopy analysis of Dnm1-GFP and mito-dsRed. Consistent with published observations, our analysis revealed that Dnm1-GFP was present in punctate structures of two distinct classes: those associated with mitochondria (Fig. 1, arrow), and those present in the cytosol (Fig. 1, arrowhead). Also consistent with previous observations (12Legesse-Miller A. Massol R.H. Kirchhausen T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1953-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we observed that the mitochondrial associated Dnm1 puncta are restricted in movement. In contrast, we observed that cytosolic Dnm1 puncta were more dynamic and relatively less abundant than the mitochondrial associated Dnm1 puncta (Fig. 1, arrow). Cytosolic puncta exhibited velocities greater than 1 μm/s and also changed trajectory with greater frequency. The differences in behavior of the cytosolic and mitochondrial populations of puncta likely reflect a regulation of Dnm1 activity by mitochondrial localized Fis1 and Mdv1. It has been shown that Mdv1 functions as an adaptor, interacting with both Fis1 and Dnm1 at a late step in the division pathway. Cytological analysis of the Mdv1·Dnm1 complex has shown that Mdv1 co-localizes with mitochondrial Dnm1 puncta (16Tieu Q. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 30Cerveny K.L. McCaffery J.M. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), but it is not known when during the division reaction Mdv1 interacts with Dnm1. Using time-lapse microscopy of GFP-Mdv1 and mito-dsRed, we found that Mdv1 puncta spend the majority of the time on the mitochondria and, unlike Dnm1 puncta, are rarely found in the cytosol (Fig. 2A). To determine when Mdv1 assembles with Dnm1 and the relationship of co-labeled structures with sites of fission, we conducted triple label experiments of GFP-Dnm1, dsRed-Mdv1, and mito-CFP. We observed from the analysis of fission events in triple labeled cells that Dnm1 puncta are first targeted to mitochondria, and then Mdv1 accumulates at sites of assembled Dnm1 structures (Fig. 2, B and C). This association was maintained until mitochondrial fission was completed (Fig. 2, B and C). This observation indicates that a structure(s) containing both Mdv1 and Dnm1 is required for the completion of mitochondrial fission. Mdv1 Interacts Specifically with Assembled Dnm1 Ring Structures—We examined the effect of Dnm1 mutants predicted to affect both GTPase and self-assembly on the formation of the Mdv1·Dnm1 complex to determine its role during mitochondrial division. We mutated and analyzed three different residues within the GTPase domain of Dnm1, Dnm1K41A, Dnm1S42N, and Dnm1T62D/F, known from studies of orthologous dynamin mutations to be involved in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. It has been shown by yeast two-hybrid assays that Dnm1 self-interacts through its GED and middle domains (28Fukushima N.H. Brisch E. Keegan B.R. Bleazard W. Shaw J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2756-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the GTPase mutants, we also analyzed Dnm1G385D, a previously reported middle domain mutant, which blocks self-assembly in vivo and in vitro (13Ingerman E. Perkins E.M. Marino M. Mears J.A. McCaffery J.M. Hinshaw J.E. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 31Jensen R.E. Aiken-Hobbs A.E. Cerveny K.L. Sesaki H. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Asexpectedandconsistentwithpreviousobservations all four Dnm1 mutants block division as observed by the inability to rescue dnm1-Δ. Additionally they are dominant negative as indicated by net formation in wild type cells (data not shown) (18Cerveny K.L. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4126-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Jensen R.E. Aiken-Hobbs A.E. Cerveny K.L. Sesaki H. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We characterized this bank of Dnm1 mutants for GTPase activity, self-assembly, and in vivo behavior (Table 2). Recently we have characterized the kinetic and structural properties of Dnm1 (13Ingerman E. Perkins E.M. Marino M. Mears J.A. McCaffery J.M. Hinshaw J.E. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that, like dynamin, Dnm1 self-assembly stimulates its own GTPase activity ∼16-fold (wild type activity, 50 min-1) and that in the presence of GTP or non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs, Dnm1 self-assembles into spiral-like structures (13Ingerman E. Perkins E.M. Marino M. Mears J.A. McCaffery J.M. Hinshaw J.E. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the absence of nucleotides or the presence of GDP, Dnm1 forms extended slightly curved filaments. In addition, we have shown that Dnm1G385D cannot self-assemble and, as a consequence, exhibits lower GTPase activity (3 min-1) (13Ingerman E. Perkins E.M. Marino M. Mears J.A. McCaffery J.M. Hinshaw J.E. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Our studies have demonstrated that Dnm1G385D exists as a nucleotide-independent stable dimer, suggesting that dimeric Dnm1 is the building block for the formation of higher order Dnm1 structures (13Ingerman E. Perkins E.M. Marino M. Mears J.A. McCaffery J.M. Hinshaw J.E. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Using identical experimental conditions, we have characterized the activity of the Dnm1 GTPase domain mutants and observe that, in contrast to wild type, and as predicted, no GTPase activity can be detected (up to 2 mm GTP) for any of these GTPase mutants. Interestingly, although Dnm1K41A possessed no activity on its own, it uniquely stimulated wild type Dnm1 GTPase activity, suggesting that Dnm1K41A can promote the self-assembly of wild type Dnm1 into structures that are activated for GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 3A).TABLE 2Summary of Dnm1 and Dnm1 mutant activitiesSelf-assemblyLocalization of puncta in vivoInteraction with Mdv1EMTwo-hybridCytologyaAs defined by Dnm1 puncta co-localization with Mdv1Two-hybridbNo growth on selective medium; + growth on selective medium.

https://openalex.org/W2090166684,"Little is known about directed motility of bacteria that move by type IV pilus–mediated (twitching) motility. Here, we found that during periodic cell reversals of Myxoccocus xanthus , type IV pili were disassembled at one pole and reassembled at the other pole. Accompanying these reversals, FrzS, a protein required for directed motility, moved in an oscillatory pattern between the cell poles. The frequency of the oscillations was controlled by the Frz chemosensory system, which is essential for directed motility. Pole-to-pole migration of FrzS appeared to involve movement along a filament running the length of the cell. FrzS dynamics may thus regulate cell polarity during directed motility."

Here we showed that MAS activity in brain mitochondria is stimulated by extramitochondrial Ca2+ with an S0.5 of 324 nm. By employing primary neuronal cultures from control and aralar-deficient mice and NAD(P)H imaging with two-photon excitation microscopy, we showed that lactate utilization involves a substantial transfer of NAD(P)H to mitochondria in control but not aralar-deficient neurons, in agreement with the lack of MAS activity associated with aralar deficiency. The increase in mitochondrial NAD(P)H was greatly potentiated by large [Ca2+]i signals both in control and aralar-deficient neurons, showing that these large signals activate the Ca2+ uniporter and mitochondrial dehydrogenases but not MAS activity. On the other hand, small [Ca2+]i signals potentiate the increase in mitochondrial NAD(P)H only in control but not in aralar-deficient neurons. We concluded that neuronal MAS activity is selectively activated by small Ca2+ signals that fall below the activation range of the Ca2+ uniporter and plays an essential role in mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling.

We concluded that neuronal MAS activity is selectively activated by small Ca2+ signals that fall below the activation range of the Ca2+ uniporter and plays an essential role in mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling. Ca2+ signaling in mitochondria is mainly achieved through the entry of Ca2+ across the Ca2+ uniporter, a highly selective Ca2+ channel whose identity remains unknown (1Gunter T.E. Yule D.I.

Because of its apparent low affinity for Ca2+, the fact that there is a substantial mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake despite modest changes in average [Ca2+]i is explained by the strategic location of mitochondria close to the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channels, or plasma membrane Ca2+ channels, and therefore to microdomains of very high [Ca2+]i (3Rizzuto R.

Indeed, the Ca2+ binding domains of aralar face the mitochondrial intermembrane space, and increases in [Ca2+]i result in the activation of aspartate-glutamate exchange, in the absence of calcium entry in mitochondria (20Palmieri L. Pardo B. Lasorsa F.M. del Arco A. Kobayashi K. Iijima M. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Saheki T. Satrustegui J. Palmieri F.

The AGCs are one of the transporters responsible for the malateaspartate NADH shuttle (MAS). Because of the electrogenic nature of Asp/Glu exchange (20Palmieri L. Pardo B. Lasorsa F.M. del Arco A.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 161: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the AGC reaction is irreversible under physiological conditions and thus a potential site for regulation. The first aim of this work was to explore the potential of aralar as a brain AGC isoform to regulate MAS activity in brain at low Ca2+ concentrations, below those required for the function of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter. MAS activity in brain mitochondria was found to have Ca2+-activation properties adequate for this purpose. The second aim of this work was to study the role of the aralar-MAS pathway in the supply of reducing equivalents to neuronal mitochondria. Aralar is expressed postnatally in rat and mouse brain, and it is located in neurons. Both MAS activity and aralar expression are acquired in parallel during neuronal maturation (22del Arco A.

Aralar is important for neuronal function as underscored by the finding that alterations in aralar gene and protein are associated with central nervous system diseases such as Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome, in which there is an impaired targeting of aralar to mitochondria (24Roesch K. Hynds P.J. Varga R. Tranebjaerg L. Koehler C.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2101-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and autism (25Ramoz N. Reichert J.G. Smith C.J. Silverman J.M. Bespalova I.N. Davis K.L. Buxbaum J.D. Am. J. Psychiatry. 2004; 161: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Aralar null mice also exhibit prominent motor coordination defects along with deficient myelination (26Jalil M.A. Begum L. Contreras L. Pardo B. Iijima M. Li M.X. Ramos M. Marmol P. Horiuchi M.

We have employed primary neuronal cultures from control and aralar-deficient mice (26Jalil M.A. Begum L. Contreras L. Pardo B. Iijima M. Li M.X. Ramos M. Marmol P. Horiuchi M. Shimotsu K. Nakagawa S. Okubo A. Sameshima M. Isashiki Y. del Arco A. Kobayashi K. Satrústegui J. Saheki T. J. Biol.

We show that MAS is the main pathway to transfer reducing equivalents to neuronal mitochondria. High [Ca2+]i signals activate the Ca2+ uniporter-mitochondrial dehydrogenases signaling pathway, whereas small [Ca2+]i signals selectively activate MAS activity in neurons. We conclude that the aralar-MAS pathway plays an essential role to transduce small [Ca2+]i signals into neuronal mitochondrial energization. Animals—Male Wistar rats (3 months old) were used to prepare rat brain and skeletal muscle mitochondria. SVJ129/C57BL mice carrying a deficiency for aralar expression, Aralar-/-, Aralar+/-, and Aralar+/+, which had been obtained from Lexicon Genetics Inc. (The Woodlands, TX) (26Jalil M.A. Begum L.

Chem. 2005; 280: 31333-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), were used to obtain primary neuronal cultures. Genotypes—Genotype was determined by PCR using genomic DNA obtained from tail or embryonic tissue samples (Nucleospin tissue kit, Macherey-Nagel). The following primers were used for genomic DNA amplification: sense primer mAra3′ LTRF3 (5′-GTTCTCTAGAAACTGCTGAGG-3′) that detects only mutated alleles, sense primer mAra int 13F1 (5′-GATGTGAGAACTCACCAGTGT-3′) that detects wild-type alleles, and antisense primer mAra int 13B (5′-ACCACCACCAGCGTGTCAGC-3′) that detects both wild-type and mutant alleles (data not shown). PCR mixtures were preincubated at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of DNA amplification at 94 °C for 60 s, 58 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s; the process was finished with an incubation at 72 °C for 5 min. Wild-type (271 bp) and mutant (406 bp) fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. Isolation of Brain and Skeletal Muscle Mitochondrial Fractions— Whole rat brains were homogenized in 250 mm sucrose, 25 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm iodoacetamide, and 0.1% BSA (w/v), pH 7.4 (1:10 w/v). Nuclei and cell debris were first removed by 10 min of centrifugation at 700 × g, and mitochondrial fractions were then spun down (15 min, 10,000 × g) and washed in 75 mm mannitol, 25 mm sucrose, 5 mm potassium phosphate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4 (mannitol/sucrose/K+medium, MSK). Brain mitochondrial fractions were suspended in the same medium (10-20 mg protein/ml) and corresponded to crude preparations containing synaptosomes and free mitochondria (27Martinez-Serrano A. Satrustegui J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Rat skeletal muscle mitochondria were obtained as described by Rolfe et al. (28Rolfe D.F. Hulbert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and suspended in MSK until used. Respiration rates were determined with a Clark-type oxygen electrode. Skeletal muscle mitochondria (0.1 to 0.2 mg protein) were added to 0.5 ml of MSK, and different Ca2+ concentrations and the respiration rate in the presence of 5 mm glutamate + 5 mm malate + 0.5 mm ADP was recorded. The free Ca2+ concentrations in each media was determined with fura-2 or Ca2+-Green as indicated below. Reconstitution of MAS Activity in Brain Mitochondria—The reconstitution of MAS is described in Jalil et al. (26Jalil M.A. Begum L. Contreras L. Pardo B. Iijima M. Li M.X. Ramos M. Marmol P. Horiuchi M. Shimotsu K. Nakagawa S. Okubo A. Sameshima M. Isashiki Y. del Arco A. Kobayashi K. Satrústegui J. Saheki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31333-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondrial fractions (0.1 to 0.15 mg protein) were suspended in 3 ml of MSK and 100 μm digitonin, and the shuttle was reconstituted in the presence of 4 units/ml glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, 6 units/ml malate dehydrogenase, 66 μm NADH, 5 mm aspartate, 5 mm malate, 0.5 mm ADP, 200 nm ruthenium red, and appropriate CaCl2 additions. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 mm glutamate, was determined from the decay in NADH fluorescence (excitation at 340 nm, emission at 465 nm), and was calibrated with appropriate NADH standards. The free Ca2+ concentrations at each Ca2+ addition were determined fluorimetrically with fura-2 (below 1 μm free Ca2+) and Ca2+-Green (above 1 μm free Ca2+). The concentrations of fura-2 (Kd = 224 nm; excitation, 340 and 380 nm; emission, 510 nm) and Ca2+-Green (Kd = 14 μm; excitation, 506 nm; emission, 532 nm) were 5 and 0.1 μm, respectively. The free Ca2+ concentration was obtained by established procedures for ratiometric or nonratiometric probes (29Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To test the effect of intramitochondrial Asp on shuttle activity, mitochondria were preloaded with Asp following published procedures (21LaNoue K.F. Meijer A.J. Brouwer A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 161: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To this end, digitonin-permeabilized mitochondrial fractions were first suspended (16 mg of protein/ml) in a glutamate-containing medium (100 mm potassium glutamate, 100 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) for 10 min at 0 °C to allow for glutamate accumulation in mitochondria. Then the suspension was diluted 1:10 in 320 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min). Glutamate-loaded mitochondria were washed with the same medium and resuspended (7 mg of protein/ml) in an Asp-loading medium (150 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4). Asp loading was started by adding 3 mm oxaloacetate, and after 3 min at 28 °C, the incubation was stopped (0 °C, 5 min of centrifugation at 10,000 × g). Asp-loaded mitochondria were washed with Asp-loading medium and resuspended in MSK to assay MAS activity. Ca2+ uptake in brain and muscle mitochondria preparations was measured in the presence of 0.1 μm Ca2+-Green 5N (excitation 506 nm, emission 532 nm) in modified MSK (without EDTA and supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2). Experiments were performed at 25 °C under constant stirring, with ADP (0.2 mm), glutamate (5 mm), and malate (5 mm) as respiratory substrates. Measurements were started by the addition of mitochondria (to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml protein; not shown). After 4 min of preincubation, a first addition of Ca2+ (50 μm) was made, followed by sequential additions of 20 μm Ca2+ as indicated. Where appropriate, 200 nm ruthenium red was added. Neuronal Cultures—Cortical neuronal cultures were prepared from 16-day-old mouse embryos, following the procedure used for rat embryos (23Ramos M. del Arco A. Pardo B. Martinez-Serrano A. Martinez-Morales J.R. Kobayashi K. Yasuda T. Bogonez E. Bovolenta P. Saheki T. Satrustegui J. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 143: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 30Ruiz F. Alvarez G. Pereira R. Hernandez M. Villalba M. Cruz F. Cerdan S. Bogonez E. Satrustegui J. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1277-1282PubMed Google Scholar) modified as follows. Mouse embryos were obtained from crosses between SVJ129/C57BL6 Aralar+/- mice, and nonbrain tissue was used for determination of DNA genotype of every embryo. Because the number of Aralar+/- embryos doubled that of Aralar+/+, Aralar+/- mice were employed as controls, unless indicated otherwise. Cerebral cortices were removed free of meninges, cut into small pieces, and enzymatically dissociated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% BSA, 0.4 mg/ml papain, and 6 mm glucose and then mechanically dissociated, in the presence of DNase, by using glass pipettes of different pore size. Dissociated cells were collected by centrifugation (800 × g, 5 min) and seeded in medium containing 20% horse serum for 3 h. After this time, medium was completely replaced with serum-free B27-supplemented Neurobasal medium (31Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). The culture medium was partially replaced every 2nd day. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 on poly-l-lysine and laminin-coated pretreated glass coverslips for the determination of [Ca2+]i (30Ruiz F. Alvarez G. Pereira R. Hernandez M. Villalba M. Cruz F. Cerdan S. Bogonez E. Satrustegui J. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1277-1282PubMed Google Scholar), or on glass coverslips sealed at the bottom of plastic wells (4-well LabTek cover slides, NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark), for two-photon microscopy. The different cell types in these neuronal cultures were characterized with specific antibodies as described earlier (30Ruiz F. Alvarez G. Pereira R. Hernandez M. Villalba M. Cruz F. Cerdan S. Bogonez E. Satrustegui J. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1277-1282PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ruiz F. Alvarez G. Ramos M. Hernandez M. Bogonez E. Satrustegui J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 404: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Under the present culture conditions, neurons represented more than 90% of the total cell population. Cultures were used for experimentation between 9 and 11 days in vitro. Two-photon Microscopy in Neuronal Cultures—Neuronal cultures, seeded on 4-well LabTek cover slides, were washed once and incubated in glucose-free HCSS (1 mm CaCl2, 120 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Hepes, 5.4 mm KCl, pH 7.4) for 1 h before experimentation. When Ca2+-free conditions were needed, cells were washed once and maintained with Ca2+-free HCSS in the presence of 100 μm EGTA. Two-photon excitation microscopy was performed by using Olympus IX70 inverted microscope with an ×60 Plan Apo NA 1.4 objective, coupled to a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 MP confocal/multiphoton microscopy system. An infrared multiphoton laser (Coherent Mira 690-1000 nm) provided excitation of intrinsic NADH fluorescence. The laser settings used for imaging were as follows: 4 milliwatts of power, with a neutral filter set to reduce the excitation light in 80%, and long wave at 735 nm with 150-fs pulses. Images were collected with a 390-460 nm emission filter. Cells were maintained at 37 °C with a temperature-controlled microscopic stage. Additions (0.1 ml) were made as a bolus to the cell chamber (initial volume, 0.5 ml). Images (averages of three frames, 512 × 512 pixels per frame, 0.4 μm/pixel) were taken every 5 or 10 s for about 2-5 min. Image analysis was carried out with MetaMorph (Universal Imaging). Mitochondrial and cytosolic intensities were determined in individual cells or groups of cells following procedures used in islet beta cells (33Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Arkhammar P. Thastrup O. Piston D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5203-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 34Rocheleau J.V. Head W.S. Nicholson W.E. Powers A.C. Piston D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30914-30920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because of their movement in and out of the focal plane, a particular mitochondria may not be imaged at all time points. Thus, the analysis was carried out only on those mitochondria that stood in the focal plane at each time point. Selected regions (with 4-10 cells) or individual cells were outlined, and intensity thresholds were set that highlighted the bright areas shown to correspond to in-focus mitochondria (from Mitotracker labeling, see below). With these thresholds, which may underestimate the mitochondrial fluorescence but avoid contamination from the cytoplasmic compartment, the intensity of these bright areas was calculated. To estimate the cytoplasmic fluorescence, intensity thresholds were set in order to include the dim areas within cells and to exclude mitochondrial fluorescence. This probably entails an overestimation of the cytosol because of the dense neurite network where neurites and background are hard to tell apart. Changes in NAD(P)H fluorescence were then calculated as mitochondrial/cytosolic (mit/cyt) NAD(P)H ratios or as normalized fluorescence values (cyt/cyt0, mit/mit0). By using a more restrictive estimation of the cytosol, mit/cyt NAD(P)H ratios were increased, but the differences between genotypes or stimuli were maintained. In each case, measurements to determine changes in NAD(P)H autofluorescence were performed in at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance was calculated for every experimental condition (genotype and/or stimuli applied) by using time course data sets of mit/cyt NAD(P)H fluorescence ratios and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Thereafter, time courses for mit/cyt NAD(P)H fluorescence ratios obtained from different genotypes or stimuli were compared by a two-factor ANOVA test. The statistically significant results of the previous comparisons are indicated in the figure legends. In addition, data at the indicated time points were used to calculate the reducing equivalent transfer ratio (quotient between maximum and initial mit/cyt NAD(P)H ratios) and were analyzed for significance (unpaired two-tailed t test or Bonferroni's test). To label mitochondria with MitoTracker, neurons were first incubated with lactate and malate to reduce mitochondrial NAD(P)H. After capturing the NAD(P)H fluorescence images, they were then incubated for 15 min with 100 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) on the microscope stage, where confocal images were captured using a He-Ne laser (543 nm excitation) and a 560-600 nm emission filter (resolution, 0.16 μm/pixel). Pyruvate Determination—Pyruvate content was measured in the neuronal cultures exposed to the same experimental conditions used for two-photon microscopy. To measure pyruvate content, cells were washed once and incubated for 1 h in glucose-free HCSS and were then incubated for 3 min in glucose- and Ca2+-free HCSS (100 μm EGTA) with 20 mm lactate and 5 mm malate. Cells were placed on ice, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and scraped into 0.5 n perchloric acid. Deproteinized cellular pellets obtained in this way were lyophilized. Pyruvate content in these samples were spectrofluorimetrically measured by a standard enzymatic end points method (35Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1974: 1452-1456Google Scholar). Determination of [Ca2+]i and [Ca2+]mit in Neuronal Cultures—It was determined that [Ca2+]i neurons were grown on coverslips and loaded with fura-2AM by incubation in Ca2+-free HCSS with 5 μm fura-2AM and 50 μm pluronic acid (Molecular Probes), for 20 min at 37 °C, and rinsed with HCSS, 1 mm CaCl2, for 30 min. The [Ca2+]i was then determined by Ca2+ imaging as described before (30Ruiz F. Alvarez G. Pereira R. Hernandez M. Villalba M. Cruz F. Cerdan S. Bogonez E. Satrustegui J. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1277-1282PubMed Google Scholar). To determine [Ca2+]mit, cells were loaded with rhod-2 as described previously (15Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Cortical neurons were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min in HCSS containing 4 μm rhod-2 AM. The dye-containing buffer was then replaced by culture medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C, under 95% air and 7% CO2, to dissipate any cytosolic dye. The combination of cold loading, to decrease the activity of intracellular cytosolic esterases, and the cationic properties of rhod-2 allowed a preferential accumulation of the dye into mitochondria. Rhod-2-loaded neurons were preincubated exactly under the same conditions used for two-photon microscopy, mounted on the stage of a confocal laser scanning (LSM510META) microscope (Axiovert 200, Zeiss), and imaged using a 40× oil Plan-Neofluar objective (1.3 NA) and an additional digital magnification of 1.2×. Images were obtained upon illumination with a helium-neon laser at 543 nm, and the emitted light was recorded with a 560 nm long-pass filter. Images (averages of 200 frames: 512 × 512 pixels, 192 μm × 192 μm) were acquired with a confocal slit aperture setting of 72 μm, once every 5 s. Confocal images were analyzed with MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). To study the variations of Ca2+ concentrations in mitochondria in single neurons, individual cells were outlined manually, and the variations in fluorescence were expressed as F/F0, where F is the emitted fluorescence at any given time, and F0 is the fluorescence of the same zone at time = 0. Ca2+ Activation of the Malate-Aspartate NADH Shuttle in Brain Mitochondria—MAS activity in brain mitochondria, measured as a decrease in NADH in the incubation medium, was dependent upon Glu addition, and under our assay conditions, it did not require Asp-preloading of mitochondria (Fig. 1, A and B). MAS activity was completely absent in brain mitochondrial fractions from Aralar-/- mice (26Jalil M.A. Begum L. Contreras L. Pardo B. Iijima M. Li M.X. Ramos M. Marmol P. Horiuchi M. Shimotsu K. Nakagawa S. Okubo A. Sameshima M. Isashiki Y. del Arco A. Kobayashi K. Satrústegui J. Saheki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31333-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition, respiration on glutamate plus malate was extremely reduced in skeletal muscle mitochondria with no compensatory increase in respiration with pyruvate plus malate (26Jalil M.A. Begum L. Contreras L. Pardo B. Iijima M. Li M.X. Ramos M. Marmol P. Horiuchi M. Shimotsu K. Nakagawa S. Okubo A. Sameshima M. Isashiki Y. del Arco A. Kobayashi K. Satrústegui J. Saheki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31333-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Similarly, the lack of citrin, the liver AGC isoform, is not accompanied by compensatory increases in the activity of the glycerol phosphate NADH shuttle (36Sinasac D.S. Moriyama M. Jalil M.A. Begum L. Li M.X. Iijima M. Horiuchi M. Robinson B.H. Kobayashi K. Saheki T. Tsui L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To study Ca2+ activation of MAS, shuttle activity was measured after the addition of calibrated Ca2+ loads in the presence of 200 nm ruthenium red (RR) to block Ca2+ uptake through the Ca2+ uniporter. Under these conditions, any activation of the shuttle can be attributed to the effect of Ca2+ on the external face of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where the Ca2+ binding domains of aralar are located (20Palmieri L. Pardo B. Lasorsa F.M. del Arco A. Kobayashi K. Iijima M. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Saheki T. Satrustegui J. Palmieri F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5060-5069Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, C and D, shows that MAS activity increased with Ca2+. The maximal activation was about 3.1-fold (from 26.7 ± 5.28 to 85.18 ± 10.4 nmol × mg protein-1 × min-1, in the absence of Ca2+ or at saturating Ca2+ concentrations, respectively) with an S0.5 of 324 ± 114 nm. A similar increase in activity (2.55 ± 0."

Cohesion and condensation require the SMC complexes, cohesin and condensin, respectively. Here we use budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to show that condensin and Cdc5, a Polo-like kinase, facilitate the removal of cohesin from chromosomes prior to the onset of anaphase I when homologs segregate. This cohesin removal is critical for homolog segregation because it helps dissolve the recombination-dependent links between homologs that form during prophase I. Condensin enhances the association of Cdc5 with chromosomes and its phosphorylation of cohesin, which in turn likely stimulates cohesin removal.

During meiosis, segregation of homologous chromosomes requires three chromosomal processes, sister chromatid cohesion, condensation, and recombination (reviewed by Zickler and Kleckner, 1999Zickler D. Kleckner N. Meiotic chromosomes: integrating structure and function.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 603-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Concomitant with DNA replication, newly replicated chromosomes (sister chromatids) become associated through sister chromatid cohesion. Sister chromatids then undergo condensation, which shortens their lengths and individualizes them such that the paired sister chromatids lie adjacent to each other in distinct domains. In the first meiotic division (MI), specialized machinery induces and regulates reciprocal recombination between homologs. This recombination coupled with cohesion generates a physical link between homologs that is critical for their subsequent segregation. How sister chromatid cohesion, condensation, and recombination are coordinated in MI remains poorly understood. Sister chromatid cohesion and condensation require two protein complexes, cohesin and condensin, respectively. Cohesin and condensin are conserved in all eukaryotes and function in both mitosis and meiosis (reviewed by Losada and Hirano, 2005Losada A. Hirano T. Dynamic molecular linkers of the genome: the first decade of the SMC proteins.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1269-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, Nasmyth and Haering, 2005Nasmyth K. Haering C.H. The structure and function of SMC and Kleisin complexes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 595-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Cohesin and condensin are structurally similar to each other, composed of two subunits belonging to the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family proteins and several additional non-SMC subunits. By studying the function and regulation of cohesin and condensin in meiosis, it has been possible to begin to address the mechanism for the coordination of sister chromatid cohesion, condensation, and recombination. Cohesin is loaded on the newly replicated sister chromatids during meiotic S phase to generate cohesion around the centromeres and along the arms (reviewed by Nasmyth and Haering, 2005Nasmyth K. Haering C.H. The structure and function of SMC and Kleisin complexes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 595-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). As a consequence of sister chromatid cohesion on the arms and reciprocal recombination between homologs, the homologs become physically linked (see diagram in Figure 1A ). This linkage is critical to a tension-sensing mechanism that ensures that homologs attach to microtubules from opposite poles of the meiosis I spindle. To initiate anaphase I and allow homologs to separate, homolog linkage is dissolved by removing cohesin from the arms (Figure 1A, steps d and e). To achieve this, separase, a cysteine protease, is activated by the degradation of its inhibitor, securin (Buonomo et al., 2000Buonomo S.B. Clyne R.K. Fuchs J. Loidl J. Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K.

Separase then cleaves a cohesin subunit, Rec8, resulting in cohesin dissociation from the chromosome arms. Rec8 phosphorylation by the Aurora-B kinase AIR-2 in C. elegans and by the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 in yeast is also required for cohesin removal, possibly because phosphorylated Rec8 is a better separase substrate (Rogers et al., 2002Rogers E.

Tham W.-H. Shah H. Amon A. A genome-wide screen identifies genes required for centromeric cohesion.Science. 2004; 303: 1367-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In meiosis II (MII), this centromere proximal cohesion is used, as in mitosis, to ensure sister chromatids segregate from each other. Like cohesin, condensin also plays a critical role in meiosis. In prophase of meiosis, condensin is activated to help promote chromosome compaction and individualization in both yeast and C. elegans (Yu and Koshland, 2003Yu H.-G. Koshland D.E. Meiotic condensin is required for proper chromosome compaction, SC assembly, and resolution of recombination-dependent chromosome linkages.J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 613-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Condensin together with cohesin is also required for formation of the synaptonemal complex, a protein filament that forms between homologs and regulates homologous recombination to ensure proper chromosome segregation (Yu and Koshland, 2003Yu H.-G. Koshland D.E. Meiotic condensin is required for proper chromosome compaction, SC assembly, and resolution of recombination-dependent chromosome linkages.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Another meiotic function for condensin is suggested from an unusual phenotype of condensin mutants in budding yeast and C. elegans. Portions of the chromosomes lag between the spindle poles of the elongating spindle, forming chromosome bridges. In condensin mutants of budding yeast, the formation of these bridges is dependent upon recombination (Yu and Koshland, 2003Yu H.-G. Koshland D.E. Meiotic condensin is required for proper chromosome compaction, SC assembly, and resolution of recombination-dependent chromosome linkages.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, the bridged region contains tightly paired telomeres from homologs of chromosome V. Based on these two observations, we postulated an explanation for chromosome bridging. During meiosis, homologs are linked by recombination. In condensin mutants, these linkages are not dissolved efficiently. As a result, homologs remain inappropriately paired and cannot be properly segregated when the spindle elongates, leading to the bridging phenotype. Thus, condensin appears to be required to dissolve recombination-dependent linkages between homologs; however, the molecular function of condensin in this resolution is unknown. In order to better understand this potential new function for condensin, we initiated experiments to characterize the spatial and temporal characteristics of the homolog linkages, to assess the molecular basis of the linkage, and to determine condensin’s role in dissolving the linkage. Our results suggest that the homolog linkages in anaphase I of condensin mutants reflect the persistence of the normal linkages that form in prophase I as consequence of reciprocal exchange and sister chromatid cohesion. Condensin helps dissolve these linkages by promoting the removal of a subset of cohesin prior to and possibly also at the onset of anaphase I. Condensin appears to promote cohesin removal through the activation of Cdc5, the Polo-like kinase of budding yeast. We discuss the importance of these results for understanding chromosome morphogenesis and for coordinating chromosome morphogenesis in meiosis. Our previous studies had shown that condensin mutants caused chromosome bridges in MI, and in one condensin mutant, ycg1-2, these bridges contained paired telomeres from homologs of chromosome V (Yu and Koshland, 2003Yu H.-G. Koshland D.E. Meiotic condensin is required for proper chromosome compaction, SC assembly, and resolution of recombination-dependent chromosome linkages.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To better understand this failure to dissolve pairing between telomeres, we first asked whether a similar defect could be observed in other condensin mutants. A temperature-sensitive allele (ycs4-2) of the Ycs4 subunit of condensin was introduced into a strain in which the two homologs of chromosome V were marked with the TetO/TetR-GFP system either at the centromere or at the right telomere (Figure 1B). Wild-type and ycs4-2 cells were induced to enter meiosis and then raised to the nonpermissive temperature for ycs4-2 inactivation. The number of GFP spots were scored in cells post-anaphase I, that is between telophase I (elongated spindles and absence of Pds1 staining, see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) and early MII (two short spindles), when homologs have normally segregated from each other. Indeed, in post-anaphase I wild-type cells, centromeres and telomeres of chromosome V homologs are separated greater than 99% of time as evidenced by the detection of separated GFP spots (Figures 1C and 1D). Centromeres of chromosome V homologs segregate with similar efficiency in ycs4-2 cells. However, ycs4-2 cells fail to separate efficiently telomeres of chromosome V homologs, as evidenced by a single GFP spot in approximately 13% of post-anaphase I cells (Figures 1C and 1D). The similarity in phenotype between mutations in different condensin subunits suggests that a function of the condensin complex is needed for the efficient resolution of linkages between telomeres of chromosome V homologs. To assess whether condensin is required for dissolving linkages between other homologs and at places other than the telomere, we generated additional wild-type and ycs4-2 strains in which we marked both homologs of chromosome IV (1532 kb), the second largest, with GFP tethered at one of three loci: centromere-proximal (12 kb to CEN4), the middle of the chromosome arm (482 kb to CEN4), and the telomere-proximal (∼5 kb from the end of the chromosome; Figure 1B). These strains were induced to undergo meiosis, raised to the nonpermissive temperature to inactivate condensin, and then analyzed for homolog pairing post-anaphase I. In wild-type cells, the centromere, arm, and telomere regions of chromosome IV homologs all segregated from each other greater than 95% of the time (data not shown). CEN4 segregated to opposite poles in ycs4-2 as efficiently as wild-type, while homologous telomeres from chromosome IV often remained paired (29% in post-anaphase I cells, Figure 1D). The arm locus also remained paired, albeit by a reduced frequency (14%, Figure 1D). This reduced frequency could reflect that homolog linkage is restricted to telomeres, and telomere pairing causes unlinked arm regions to overlap occasionally. While we cannot rule this possibility out, the efficient segregation of the centromere sequences indicates that the homologs are being pulled apart. This pulling should separate unlinked arm sequences apart as well. Therefore, we favor the interpretation that the presence of paired arm sequences in ycs4-2 mutants reflects the existence of homolog linkages on the arms. Thus, our data suggest that condensin is needed to dissolve homolog linkages both on arms and telomeres. The persistence of homolog linkages post-anaphase I might reflect that these linkages result from an aberrant process and cannot be dissolved by normal meiotic machinery. Alternatively, these linkages may be produced by the normal pathway of reciprocal recombination and sister chromatid cohesion in prophase I. In this case, the linkages would persist post-anaphase I in condensin mutants because of a defect in a normal pathway to dissolve these linkages, specifically the removal of cohesin and the dissolution of sister chromatid cohesion on chromosome arms (Figure 1A). To assess whether there is a defect in cohesin removal in condensin mutants, we asked whether in ycs4-2 cells chromosome-associated cohesin remains inappropriately on the arms of homologs after anaphase I. To follow chromosome bound cohesin, we generated YCS4 and ycs4-2 strains with epitope tags on two cohesin subunits, REC8 or SMC1. Nuclear spreads were prepared from these strains and then processed for indirect immunofluorescence (Figures 2A and S2). After anaphase I, wild-type cells have Rec8 and Smc1 foci near the spindle pole bodies consistent with their localization to centromeres but not arm regions of chromosomes. In contrast, after anaphase I, ycs4-2 cells with bridges have Rec8 and Smc1 localized throughout the chromosomes (Figures 2A and S2). Chromosome arm-associated Rec8 is not removed efficiently in ycg1-2, a mutant allele of another condensin subunit (Figure 2A). These results strongly suggest that condensin is required for the efficient removal of cohesin from chromosome arms. If the persistence of cohesin and in turn sister chromatid cohesion on chromosome arms is the cause of homolog linkages in condensin mutants, then the inactivation of cohesin should allow homologs to segregate. To disrupt sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis, we introduced a null allele of REC8 (rec8Δ) into ycs4-2. In ycs4-2 rec8Δ, less than 2% of anaphase I cells exhibited linkage at telomere V as compared to 13% in ycs4-2 cells (Figure 1D). This result is consistent with the hypothesis that homolog linkage occurs in condensin mutants because of a failure to remove cohesin. That is, in wild-type cells, condensin is required to help dissolve sister chromatid cohesion on chromosome arms. Our interpretation of our results with cohesin condensin double mutants is complicated by the fact that cohesin is needed for normal levels of meiotic recombination and cell cycle progression (Klein et al., 1999Klein F. Mahr P. Galova M. Buonomo S.B. Michaelis C. Nairz K. Nasmyth K. A central role for cohesins in sister chromatid cohesion, formation of axial elements, and recombination during yeast meiosis.Cell. 1999; 98: 91-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, Cha et al., 2000Cha R.S. Weiner B.M. Keeney S. Dekker J. Kleckner N. Progression of meiotic DNA replication is modulated by interchromosomal interaction proteins, negatively by Spo11p and positively by Rec8p.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 493-503PubMed Google Scholar). Since we showed previously that recombination is necessary for homolog linkage in condensin mutants (Yu and Koshland, 2003Yu H.-G. Koshland D.E. Meiotic condensin is required for proper chromosome compaction, SC assembly, and resolution of recombination-dependent chromosome linkages.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the deletion of Rec8 may eliminate linkages by reducing recombination rather than eliminating cohesion. To circumvent this caveat, we attempted to remove the persistent cohesin in condensin mutants by enhancing the cell’s ability to inactivate cohesin in anaphase I. For this purpose, the expression of ESP1 was increased about 2-fold in meiosis by replacing one copy of the endogenous ESP1 promoter with the DMC1 promoter (data not shown). Unlike rec8Δ, this increased separase expression had no detectable effect on the level of recombination (Figure S3). However, this increased separase expression in condensin mutants caused a 2-fold reduction of Rec8 on chromosome arms and a greater than 2-fold reduction in the pairing of chromosome V homologs in post-anaphase I cells (Figures 2B and 2C). This result suggests that in condensin mutants, it is indeed the persistence of cohesin on chromosome arms that prevents the dissolution of homolog linkage. While chromosome V homologs separate efficiently in ycs4-2 rec8Δ or ycs4-2 PDMC1ESP1 cells, chromosome bridging is still observed in these double mutants, suggesting that some homologs remain linked even in the absence of cohesin (Figure S4). This cohesin-independent bridging is due to a failure to separate the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats on homologs of chromosome XII (Figure S4). Therefore, in condensin mutants, chromosome bridging between homologs results from cohesin-dependent linkage between most homologs and cohesin-independent linkage between the rDNA repeats. Interestingly, in mitosis, condensin is also required to dissolve cohesin-independent linkages between sister chromatids that occur at the rDNA (D’Amours et al., 2004D’Amours D. Stegmeier F. Amon A.

The nature of this linkage at the rDNA and condensin’s role in dissolving it both in mitosis and meiosis is the subject of additional studies. Having shown that condensin is required for the removal of cohesin from chromosome arms in MI, we addressed when condensin is needed to facilitate cohesin removal. As a guide, we turned to studies of metazoan mitosis. A subset of cohesin dissociates from chromosomes at prophase by one pathway, and the remainder is removed at the onset of anaphase by a second pathway (Losada et al., 1998Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T.

Two distinct pathways remove mammalian cohesin from chromosome arms in prophase and centromeres in anaphase.Cell. 2000; 103: 399-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). While previous studies have shown that meiotic cohesin is removed at the onset of anaphase I (Buonomo et al., 2000Buonomo S.B. Clyne R.K. Fuchs J. Loidl J. Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K. Disjunction of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I depends on proteolytic cleavage of the meiotic cohesin Rec8 by separin.Cell. 2000; 103: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), the removal of a subset of cohesin during prophase I or metaphase I had not been addressed. Therefore, we first tested whether meiotic cohesin can be removed prior to anaphase I. To follow chromosome-associated cohesin, nuclear spreads were prepared from meiotic cells with the epitope-tagged alleles of the cohesin subunits, REC8, SCC3, or SMC1, and the amount of chromosomal bound cohesin subunit was quantified by indirect immunofluorescence (Figures 3 and S5). We used spindle and chromosome morphology to identify nuclei at the stages prior to anaphase I. Prophase I (in particular pachytene) cells have morphologically distinct and individualized chromosomes and either unseparated or closely juxtaposed spindle pole bodies. In metaphase I cells, chromosomes are no longer individualized, and short- to medium-sized spindles (∼2 μm) have formed (Figures 3A and 3E and see below). Using these criteria, the intensity of chromosome bound Rec8 in metaphase I cells is reduced compared to prophase I cells (Figure 3A). Similarly, chromosome bound Scc3 and Smc1 are also reduced at metaphase I compared to prophase I (Figures 3E and S5). These observations suggest that a subset of meiotic cohesin is removed from the chromosomes between prophase I and metaphase I. One potential problem with this conclusion is that cells have the same morphology at metaphase I and just after anaphase I onset when cohesin is known to be removed by separase. To address further the timing of cohesin removal, we analyzed chromosome-associated cohesin in cells that were unable to progress beyond metaphase I because they lacked Cdc20 (PCLB2CDC20), an activator of the anaphase promoting complex (Lee and Amon, 2003Lee B.H. Amon A. Role of Polo-like kinase CDC5 in programming meiosis I chromosome segregation.Science. 2003; 300: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Using the same criteria to distinguish cells at prophase I or metaphase I, we found that the amount of chromosome-associated cohesin in cells arrested in metaphase I is reduced to about 50% of prophase I for both Rec8 and Scc3 (Figures 3C, 3D, and 3G). Thus, from these analyses of both normal and metaphase-arrested meiotic cells, a subset of cohesin appears to be removed from chromosomes between prophase I and metaphase I. To test the validity of this conclusion, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to assess the chromosome association of cohesin. While immunofluorescence allowed us to focus on individual cells, ChIP allowed us to evaluate a much larger population of cells. During synchronous meiosis of Cdc20-depleted cells, the majority of cells are at prophase I by 6 hr after induction of meiosis, while ∼95% of cells are arrested at metaphase I by 11 hr after induction of meiosis (data not shown). We analyzed two representative cohesin-associated regions, a centromere site, CEN3, and a chromosome arm site, CARC7 (Figure 4A ). At both sites, the chromosome association of Rec8 decreases ∼2-fold between prophase I and metaphase I (Figures 4B and 4C), in agreement with the value obtained by cytological analysis (Figures 3C and 3D). Thus, both by indirect immunofluorescence and ChIP, we show that a subset of cohesin is removed prior to anaphase I. Having established that meiotic cohesin is removed prior to anaphase I, we next addressed if condensin is required for this phase of cohesin removal. Using the same immunofluorescence and ChIP methods, we analyzed chromatin bound cohesin in meiotic ycs4-2 cells in which Ycs4 function was inactivated. Both Rec8 and Scc3 are localized along the entire length of the chromosomes at metaphase I in ycs4-2, essentially no different from prophase I (Figures 3B and 3F, lower panels), and the total intensity of chromosomal Rec8 and Scc3 is similar between prophase I and metaphase I in ycs4-2 (Figures 3D and 3G). The inhibition of cohesin removal is also observed in ycg1-2 (our unpublished data). Consistent with the immunofluorescence data, the cohesin binding pattern as determined by ChIP at CEN3 and CARC7 does not change significantly between prophase I and metaphase I in ycs4-2 cells (Figures 4D and 4E). Taken together, the immunofluorescence and ChIP analyses show that condensin is required for removal of a subset of cohesin between prophase I and metaphase I. We reasoned that condensin may mediate cohesin removal from chromosomes by influencing established regulators of cohesin removal. One obvious candidate is the separase, Esp1. Indeed, previous studies of ESP1 mutant cells showed that they are defective for cohesin removal at the anaphase I onset (Buonomo et al., 2000Buonomo S.B. Clyne R.K. Fuchs J. Loidl J. Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K. Disjunction of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I depends on proteolytic cleavage of the meiotic cohesin Rec8 by separin.Cell. 2000; 103: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). To test whether cohesin removal prior to anaphase I onset is also dependent on Esp1 function, we constructed an esp1-1 PCLB2CDC20 strain. This strain was induced to undergo meiosis, raised to the nonpermissive temperature to inactivate esp1-1, and then analyzed for chromosome bound cohesin in prophase I and metaphase I as described above. Rec8 removal prior to anaphase I was unaffected in this strain (Figures 3C and 3D), suggesting that condensin-dependent removal of cohesin at this stage is independent of Esp1. Two other potential regulators of condensin-dependent cohesin removal are the Aurora B and Polo-like kinases since both have been shown to have defects in cohesin removal in meiosis (Rogers et al., 2002Rogers E. Bishop J.D. Waddle J.A. Schumacher J.M. Lin R. The aurora kinase AIR-2 functions in the release of chromosome cohesion in Caenorhabditis elegans meiosis.J.

Role of Polo-like kinase CDC5 in programming meiosis I chromosome segregation.Science. 2003; 300: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that condensin might influence either directly or indirectly these kinases to regulate cohesin removal. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether cohesin removal prior to anaphase I require either Cdc5 (Polo), Ipl1 (Aurora), or both. We used indirect immunofluorescence to monitor chromatin bound cohesin in prophase I and metaphase I cells in which either Cdc5 or Ipl1 was depleted during meiosis (Figure 5). Depletion of Cdc5 and Ipl1 was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis. Cdc5 or Ipl1 protein was not detectable 2 hr after induction of meiosis, nor at any time thereafter (Lee and Amon, 2003Lee B.H. Amon A. Role of Polo-like kinase CDC5 in programming meiosis I chromosome segregation.Science. 2003; 300: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar; our unpublished data). In Cdc5-depleted cells, Rec8 removal prior to anaphase I is completely inhibited (Figure 5A, upper panels), while in Ipl1-depleted cells, Rec8 removal occurs albeit less efficiently (Figure 5A, lower panels). Thus, Cdc5, and Ipl1 to a lesser extent, is critical for cohesin removal prior to anaphase I. Having implicated Cdc5 and Ipl1 in cohesin removal, we next addressed whether condensin might be required for Cdc5 and Ipl1 activity. In order to address this question, we needed a substrate to monitor the activity of these kinases. Rec8 had been shown in C. elegans to be phosphorylated by an Ipl1 ortholog, AIR-2, and in budding yeast to be hyperphosphorylated by Cdc5 (Rogers et al., 2002Rogers E. Bishop J.D. Waddle J.A.

In addition to Cys-184, the hydrophilic side chains of His-120 and Arg-197 are absolutely required for catalysis (20Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Alksne L. Schneewind O. J. Biol.

Using NMR and crystallography, the LPXTG sorting signal binding site has recently been localized to a surface formed by strands β4 and β7, and to a proximal loop that connects strands β6 to β7(the β6/β7 loop) (18Zong Y.

Substrate binding may occur through an induced-fit mechanism involving conformational changes in the β6/β7 loop, because it is disordered in the absence of the sorting signal substrate (17Ilangovan U.

A. 2001; 98: 6056-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and may enable S. aureus to increase the rate of surface protein anchoring as it encounters elevated concentrations of this ion at sites of infection. Because many surface proteins function as virulence factors, the stimulatory effect of Ca2+ likely plays an important role in the infection process. Previously we showed that Ca2+ bound to an ordered pocket positioned distal to the active site (hereafter referred to as the β3/β4 pocket) (17Ilangovan U. Ton-That H. Iwahara J. Schneewind O. Clubb R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6056-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, this work did not reveal how Ca2+ stimulated enzyme activity. Here we show using enzyme kinetic and detailed NMR nitrogen-15 measurements that a single Ca2+ ion bound to the β3/β4 pocket promotes substrate binding. We provide evidence that ion binding to this distal site allosterically controls enzyme activity by altering motions in the active site β6/β7 loop. In particular, we show that Ca2+ retards motions and induces slow micro- to millisecond time-scale dynamics within the loop that may promote the adaptive recognition of the substrate. The results of relaxation compensated Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) experiments suggest that the active site motions are correlated with the rate of ion binding. The results of site-directed mutagenesis suggest that this motional coupling is mediated by the side chain of Glu-171, which is located at the C-terminal end of the β6/β7 loop and required for high affinity ion binding. This work represents the first NMR dynamics study of a sortase enzyme and reveals that complex conformational dynamics contribute to the function of these enzymes.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Preparation and Purification—Uniformly 15N-enriched SrtAΔN59 (residues 60–206) was obtained as previously described (17Ilangovan U. Ton-That H. Iwahara J. Schneewind O. Clubb R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6056-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Three separate samples of 3 mm 15N SrtAΔN59 were prepared for relaxation studies by dissolving weighed lyophilized protein in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 7% D2O, and 0.01% NaN3. The pH of the sample was adjusted to 6.20 (uncorrected for the deuterium effect). Each sample differed in the amount of Ca2+ present: 1) no Ca2+ (apo-Ca2+ SrtAΔN59), 2) 20 μm of CaCl2, or 3) 20 mm Ca2+ (Ca2+-bound SrtAΔN59). Where needed, the water used for the samples was preconditioned with Chelex resin. The Mn2+ and Ca2+ titration experiments were conducted on similar samples of 15N SrtAΔN59 using defined amounts of these ions. The histidine-tagged single amino acid mutants of sortase were purified using a nickel column and exchanged into the appropriate buffer for enzymatic and NMR studies.Modification of SrtAΔN59 by the Peptidyl-Sulfhydryl Compound—A peptidyl-sulfhydryl compound (benzoyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Pro-Ala-Thr with a C-terminal -CH2SH group) was used to modify SrtAΔN59 (the synthesis of the compound will be reported elsewhere). A 5-fold molar excess of the compound was added to two samples of SrtAΔN59 (500 μl ofa20 μm protein solution) in buffer I (pH 8.0, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and 100 mm NaCl), one without Ca2+ and one containing 20 mm CaCl2. The mixture was incubated on a rotating wheel at room temperature, and samples were removed periodically and analyzed using reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column (Waters, Mildford, MA). The areas under the peaks corresponding to modified and unmodified SrtA in the chromatogram were integrated to calculate the percentage of modification at each time point.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Wild-type SrtAΔN59 plasmid containing a C-terminal 6-His tag was generated as described previously (24Mao H. Hart S.A. Schink A. Pollok B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 2670-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Single amino acid mutations of SrtAΔN59 were generated by PCR using the SrtAΔN59 plasmid template and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The Glu-108 codon was mutated to encode Ala-108 using the primers E108A-F (TAAGCTTTGCAGAAGAAAATGCATCACTAGATGATCAAAATATTT) and E108A-R (AAATATTTTGATCATCTAGTGATGCATTTTCTTCTGCAAAGCTTA). The Asp-170 codon was mutated to encode Ala-170 using the primers D170A-F (ACAGATGTAGGAGTTCTAGCAGAACAAAAAGGTAAAGATAA) and D170A-R (TTATCTTTACCTTTTTGTTCTGCTAGAACTCCTACATCTGT). The Glu-171 codon was mutated to encode Ala-171 using the primers E171A-F (CAGATGTAGGAGTTCTAGATGCACAAAAAGGTAAAGATAAACAATT) and E171A-R (AATTGTTTATCTTTACCTTTTTGTGCATCTAGAACTCCTACATCTG) (underlined nucleotides mark mutational changes). The identity of the mutants was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Purification of the wild-type and mutant enzymes was performed as previously described (24Mao H. Hart S.A. Schink A. Pollok B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 2670-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar).Enzyme Kinetics Measurements—A self-quenched fluorescent peptide, o-aminobenzoyl-LPETG-2,4-dinitrophenyl, was used as a substrate in the cleavage reaction as previously described (25Huang X. Aulabaugh A. Ding W. Kapoor B. Alksne L. Tabei K. Ellestad G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11307-11315Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 1.5 μm SrtAΔN59 enzyme in the assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with various concentrations of CaCl2). The aminobenzoyl-LPETG-dinitrophenyl substrate was dissolved in Me2SO and added to the reaction to a final concentration between 6.25 and 25 μm, for a total reaction volume of 200 μl. The increase in fluorescence intensity was monitored at room temperature using excitation at 335 nm and recording the emission maximum at 420 nm on a SPEX spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ). The steady-state velocities (Vs) from the biphasic progress curves were calculated as described previously (25Huang X. Aulabaugh A. Ding W. Kapoor B. Alksne L. Tabei K. Ellestad G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11307-11315Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The progress curves were fit to the following equation, P=π[1-exp(-kobst)+Vst](Eq. 1) where π is the amplitude of the burst phase. The kinetic parameters were calculated from the substrate dependence of Vs as described previously (25Huang X. Aulabaugh A. Ding W. Kapoor B. Alksne L. Tabei K. Ellestad G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11307-11315Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).Relaxation Data Acquisition and Processing—NMR data were acquired on Bruker Avance 500- and 600-MHz spectrometers equipped with 5-mm triple resonance cryo-probes and single axis pulsed field gradients. The chemical shift assignments have been reported previously for SrtA in the presence of 20 mm CaCl2 (17Ilangovan U. Ton-That H. Iwahara J. Schneewind O. Clubb R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6056-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) (BioMagResBank Code 4879), and near complete backbone assignments for the apo-Ca2+ form of the protein were obtained using standard triple resonance techniques. 3M. T. Naik, N. Suree, U. Ilangovan, C. K. Liew, W. Thieu, D. O. Campbell, J. J. Clemens, M. E. Jung, and R. T. Clubb, unpublished observation. The 15N spin-lattice/longitudinal (R1), and spin-spin/transverse (R2) relaxation rates, and the steady-state heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE values were measured as previously described (26Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2415) Google Scholar, 27Kordel J. Skelton N.J. Akke M. Palmer 3rd, A.G. Chazin W.J.

Reson. 1993; 102: 253-264Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Ten R1 two-dimensional experiments were performed in random order, with relaxation delays of 42 (duplicate), 167, 335, 544 (duplicate), 816, 1172, 1591, and 2428 ms. Similarly, R2 experiments were performed randomly with relaxation delays of 17 (duplicate), 35, 52 (duplicate), 69, 86, 104, 121, and 138 ms. The NOE experiment was carried out in an interleaved manner, with and without proton saturation and repeated thrice under identical conditions. All experiments were acquired with 2048 × 256 complex points in the F2 and F1 dimensions with corresponding spectral widths of 10,000 and 2,027 Hz, and the proton carrier frequency was set to the water resonance. The data sets were processed using nmrPipe (29Delaglio F. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11379) Google Scholar), and peak heights were determined using Sparky (30Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. Sparky 3 NMR Software. University of California, San Francisco2001Google Scholar) operating on a Linux work station.The following programs used to analyze the relaxation data were kindly provided by Prof. Arthur G. Palmer 3rd at Columbia University: Curvefit, Pbdinertia, R2R1_Diffusion, Quadric Diffusion, and Model-free 4.01. The rate constants were evaluated using the program Curvefit, assuming mono-exponential decay of the peak intensities. The errors in peak intensities were calculated from the two duplicate experiments using a Perl language script kindly provided by Prof. Patrick Loria at Yale University. The error in the Heteronuclear NOEs was calculated by propagating the base-plane noise as calculated from the signal-to-noise ratio and is the average derived from three experiments. The 1H-15N HSQC spectra of SrtAΔN59 in both the absence and presence of Ca2+ are well resolved, enabling the reliable measurement of relaxation parameters for 92 and 98 residues respectively, out of a total of 148. The average R1, R2, and {1H}-15N NOE parameters for apo-Ca2+ SrtAΔN59 are, respectively, 1.59 ± 0.08 s-1, 13.95 ± 5.80 s-1, and 0.72 ± 0.29 at 500 MHz and 1.29 ± 0.08 s-1, 14.84 ± 5.72 s-1, and 0.77 ± 0.25 at 600 MHz. For Ca2+-bound SrtAΔN59, the average values are, respectively, 1.62 ± 0.10 s-1, 13.38 ± 5.68 s-1, and 0.80 ± 0.19 at 500 MHz and 1.30 ± 0.06 s-1, 15.10 ± 8.71 s-1, and 0.83 ± 0.16 at 600 MHz.Optimization of Diffusion Tensor—Multiple approaches were used to assess the overall motion of SrtAΔN59, because motional anisotropy also contributes to the R2 values, and if miss-identified can cause erroneous internal correlation times (τe) and Rex values (31Tjandra N. Kuboniwa H. Ren H. Bax A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1014-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 32Kneller J.M. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 1852-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The principal moments of the inertia tensor were calculated using the program Pdbinertia, and the values are 1.00:0.90:0.80 and 1.00:0.90:0.78, for the NMR solution structure of Ca2+-bound SrtAΔN59 (PDB accession code: 1IJA) and the Ca2+-free crystal structure (PDB accession code: 1T2P) after the addition of hydrogen atoms using the program MolMol (33Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6468) Google Scholar), respectively. Similar moments were obtained using the program HydroNMR version 5a (34Garcia de la Torre J. Huertas M.L. Carrasco B. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 147: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), where the proteins were assumed to be hydrated with a 3.1 Å water shell (1.00:0.88:0.84 for Ca2+-bound SrtAΔN59 and 1.00:0.88: 0.86 for apo-Ca2+ SrtAΔN59). The latter analysis also provided an estimate of the molecular correlation time (τm) of each form of the protein: 11.03 and 9.89 ns for apo-Ca2+ and Ca2+-bound SrtAΔN59, respectively. Because the relative moments for both apo-Ca2+ and Ca2+-bound SrtAΔN59 vary significantly from a perfect sphere, the approach outlined by Tjandra et al. (31Tjandra N. Kuboniwa H. Ren H. Bax A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1014-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) was used to check the statistical significance of fitting the relaxation data to an axially symmetric model versus an isotropic model (R2R1_Diffusion program). These calculations were performed using data from residues whose R2/R1 ratios were within one standard deviation from the average R2/R1 ratio, and which had NOE ratios > 0.65 (35Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). The results from 500 MHz (and 600 MHz) data suggested a τm of 9.69 ns (9.54 ns) for Ca2+-bound SrtAΔN59 and a τm of 10.35 ns (9.94 ns) for apo-Ca2+ SrtAΔN59. The data also showed a statistically significant improvement when using the axial symmetric model over the simple isotropic diffusion model. Interestingly, the Ca2+-bound SrtAΔN59 data fit best to a prolate ellipsoid, whereas the apo-Ca2+ SrtAΔN59 data fit best assuming an oblate ellipsoid. This variation is mostly due to subtle differences in the β6/β7 loop orientation in the two structures. The tensor parameters were also calculated using the approach outlined by Bruschweiler et al. (36Lee L.K. Rance M. Chazin W.J. Palmer 3rd., A.G. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 37Bruschweiler R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 38Bruschweiler R. Liao X. Wright P.E. Science. 1995; 268: 886-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) using the program Quadric_Diffusion, which gave slightly elevated correlation times of 9.86 ns (9.80 ns) for Ca2+-bound SrtAΔN59 and 10.62 ns (10.17 ns) for apo-Ca2+ SrtAΔN59 from 500 MHz (and 600 MHz) data, but the axial symmetric model was preferred over the isotropic or fully anisotropic models. The results from this final calculation were used as an initial guess for Modelfree analysis described below.Modelfree Analysis—The amplitudes and effective correlation times for a protein's internal motions can be extracted from relaxation data using the Lipari-Szabo Modelfree formalism (39Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3364) Google Scholar, 40Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4559-4570Crossref Scopus (1862) Google Scholar). The analysis considers five semi-empirical forms of the spectral density function with each form composed of terms describing the motion of the N–H bond vector. This internal motion can be assumed to occur on two different, fast and slow time scales and can be characterized by effective correlation times, τf and τs (where τf << τs << τm) and the square of order parameters, S2f and S2s. The square of the generalized order parameters is defined as S2 = S2f S2s and corresponds to the spatial restriction of the N–H bond vector (where 0 ≤ S2 ≤ 1). The analysis also accounts for line broadening due to chemical exchange, Rex. All these motional parameters were fit to the spin-relaxation data using the program Modelfree 4.01 (41Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer 3rd., A.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16009-16023Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 42Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer 3rd., A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). For each model, 500 randomly distributed data sets were generated, and model selection was done using a statistical testing protocol described by Mandel et al. (42Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer 3rd., A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Initially, models were selected at fixed diffusion tensor parameters by comparing the sum-squared error of optimal fit with the 0.05 critical value of the distribution and wherever applicable, by F-test comparisons to the 0.20 critical value of the distribution. In the next step, after a model had been assigned to each spin, both the diffusion tensor and model parameters were optimized simultaneously. We used an N–H bond length of 1.02 Å and 15N chemical shift anisotropy values of -160 ppm in our backbone spin calculations. For the sole tryptophan (Trp-136) side-chain spin, a chemical shift anisotropy value of -126 ppm was used (43Hu W. Lee K.C. Cross T.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7035-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A minimum 3% base error is assumed in all parameters in the Modelfree analysis (44Korzhnev D.M. Salvatella X. Vendruscolo M. Di Nardo A.A. Davidson A.R. Dobson C.M. Kay L.E. Nature. 2004; 430: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 45Mueller G.A. Pari K. DeRose E.F. Kirby T.W. London R.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9332-9342Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Out of 92 quantifiable residues in apo-Ca2+ SrtAΔN59, 89 could be satisfactorily fit using Modelfree analysis (the relaxation data of Ser-70, Glu-95, and Ile-123 could not be fit). Model 1 (S2-only) was an appropriate fit for 63 residues, 3 residues fit to model 2 (S2 and τe), 13 residues fit to model 3 (S2 and Rex), 2 fit to model 4 (S2, τe, and Rex), and 11 residues fit to model 5(S2f, S2s, and τe). In the Ca2+-bound SrtAΔN59 data, 94 out of a total of 98 quantifiable spins could be fit satisfactorily (the exceptions were Glu-95, Arg-99, Ile-123, and Gln-172). In the Ca2+-bound SrtAΔN59 analysis, Model 1 (S2) was selected for 75 residues, 3 residues fit to model 2 (S2 and τe), 12 residues fit to model 3 (S2 and Rex), 2 fit to model 4 (S2, τe, and Rex), and 6 residues fit to model 5 (S2f, S2s, and τe). Interestingly, in both Ca2+-bound and apo-Ca2+ SrtAΔN59, the relaxation data from Glu-95 and Ile-123 could not be fit to any model, suggesting that they undergo more complicated motions. The results of the model-free analysis for both conditions are provided in supplemental Tables S1 and S2. The average order parameters for apo-Ca2+and Ca2+-bound SrtAΔN59 are 0.88 ± 0.14 and 0.89 ± 0.10, respectively. If only residues located in regions of regular secondary structure are considered, the order parameters are 0.943 ± 0.030 and 0.935 ± 0.016, for apo-Ca2+and Ca2+-bound SrtAΔN59, respectively.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCa2+ Promotes Substrate Binding—To identify the step(s) at which Ca2+ stimulates catalysis, we monitored the in vitro activity of SrtAΔN59 using an internally quenched fluorescent substrate analogue (o-aminobenzoyl-L-P-E-T-G-2,4-dinitrophenyl) (25Huang X. Aulabaugh A. Ding W. Kapoor B. Alksne L. Tabei K. Ellestad G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11307-11315Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The SrtAΔN59 mediated cleavage of the peptide bond between the threonine and glycine residues in this substrate results in an increase in fluorescence and can be used to monitor both hydrolysis and transpeptidation. The presence of Ca2+ stimulates both the hydrolytic and transpeptidation activities of SrtAΔN59 (data not shown). Because both reactions differ only in the nucleophile used to resolve the acyl-intermediate, these results indicate that ion binding activates an early step in catalysis (e.g. sorting signal binding, activation of the Cys-184 thiol, or resolution of the enzyme-sorting signal thioacyl intermediate). To further pinpoint the step at which it acts, we monitored the hydrolytic activity of SrtAΔN59 in the presence of varying amounts of Ca2+. The hydrolysis reaction can be represented as in Reaction 1, where E, E·RCO-X, and RCO-E represent the free enzyme, the enzyme-bound to the sorting signal, and the acyl enzyme·substrate complex, respectively; RCO2H and XH are the cleav"

Here we investigated the role of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan, perlecan, in the formation of human epidermis, by utilizing in vitro engineered human skin. By disrupting perlecan expression either in the dermis or the epidermis, we found that epidermally derived perlecan is essential for epidermal formation. Perlecan-deficient keratinocytes formed a strikingly thin and poorly organized epidermis because of premature apoptosis and failure to complete their stratification program. Exogenous perlecan fully restored epidermal formation. Perlecan deposition in the basement membrane zone correlated with formation of multilayered epidermis. Perlecan deficiency, however, had no effect on the lining and deposition of major basement membrane components as was evident by a continuous linear staining of laminin and collagen IV. Similarly, perlecan deficiency did not affect the distribution of β1 integrin. Addition of the perlecan ligand, fibroblast growth factor 7, protected perlecan-deficient keratinocytes from cell death and improved the thickness of the epidermis. Taken together, our results revealed novel roles for perlecan in epidermal formation. Perlecan regulates both the survival and terminal differentiation steps of keratinocytes. Our results suggested a model whereby perlecan regulates these processes via controlling the bioavailability of perlecan-binding soluble factors involved in epidermal morphogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2091591759,"The GLUT4 glucose transporter is predominantly retained inside basal fat and muscle cells, and it is rapidly recruited to the plasma membrane with insulin stimulation. There is controversy regarding the mechanism of basal GLUT4 retention. One model is that GLUT4 retention is dynamic, based on slow exocytosis and rapid internalization of the entire pool of GLUT4 (Karylowski, O., Zeigerer, A., Cohen, A., and McGraw, T. E. (2004) Mol. Biol. Cell 15, 870–882). In this model, insulin increases GLUT4 in the plasma membrane by modulating GLUT4 exocytosis and endocytosis. The second model is that GLUT4 retention is static, with ∼90% of GLUT4 stored in compartments that are not in equilibrium with the cell surface in basal conditions (Govers, R., Coster, A. C., and James, D. E. (2004) Mol. Cell Biol. 24, 6456–6466). In this model, insulin increases GLUT4 in the plasma membrane by releasing it from the static storage compartment. Here we show that under all experimental conditions examined, basal GLUT4 retention is by a bipartite dynamic mechanism involving slow efflux and rapid internalization. To establish that the dynamic model developed in studies of the extreme conditions of >100 nm insulin and no insulin also describes GLUT4 behavior at more physiological insulin concentrations, we characterized GLUT4 trafficking in 0.5 nm insulin. This submaximal insulin concentration promotes an intermediate effect on both GLUT4 exocytosis and endocytosis, resulting in an intermediate degree of redistribution to the plasma membrane. These data establish that changes in the steady-state surface/total distributions of GLUT4 are the result of gradated, insulin-induced changes in GLUT4 exocytosis and endocytosis rates.

Insulin regulates glucose uptake into fat and muscle cells by eliciting a redistribution of the GLUT4 from its predominantly intracellular localization to the plasma membrane (1Czech M.P. Corvera S.

This redistribution corresponds to a shift from less than 5% GLUT4 in the plasma membrane in basal conditions to about 50% of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane in the presence of insulin. The mechanism by which insulin causes the redistribution of GLUT4 has not been elucidated. Intracellular retention of GLUT4 in basal conditions, by establishing a low basal glucose flux into muscle and fat, has a role in maintaining basal glucose homeostasis and in maximizing the potential range of stimulatory effects of insulin on glucose uptake. Consequently, understanding the mechanism of basal retention is critical for understanding regulated glucose transport into muscle and adipose.

An alternative retention model has recently been proposed in which intracellular retention of GLUT4 is maintained by a “static” mechanism, with the vast majority of GLUT4 not in equilibrium with the plasma membrane in basal conditions (15Govers R. Coster A.C. James D.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6456-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These different models suggest different molecular mechanisms for the basal retention of GLUT4. In the dynamic model, insulin regulates steady-state GLUT4 distribution by affecting the kinetics of its cycling (both exocytosis and endocytosis). In contrast, the static retention model suggests that insulin regulates the pool size of GLUT4 that moves to the plasma membrane and consequently that basal exclusion of GLUT4 from the plasma membrane is achieved because the majority of GLUT4 is fixed inside the cell. To understand insulin regulation of GLUT4 trafficking, it is imperative that we understand the retention mechanism. In addition, this controversy raises questions about the methods used to analyze GLUT4 trafficking, warranting a detailed comparison of these widely used methods. Here we compare the different methods used to examine GLUT4 trafficking. We find that GLUT4 continually cycles between intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane in the basal conditions, regardless of transfection method (electroporation versus retroviral infection) and the GLUT4 reporter used (HA-GLUT4 versus HA-GLUT4-GFP). These data are in agreement with our previous results, and they provide additional support for the dynamic, bipartite retention model (8Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the second part of this paper, we explore the mechanism of insulin regulation of GLUT4 trafficking from a different perspective. In order to provide a view of the transition between the two end points of basal (no insulin) and maximal stimulation (200 nm insulin), we examined the trafficking kinetics of GLUT4 at submaximal insulin concentrations. Here we report that in submaximal insulin (0.5 nm), the changes in the rates of GLUT4 exocytosis and internalization are intermediate between basal and maximal insulin. Thus, the dynamic, bipartite GLUT4 trafficking model describes the behavior of GLUT4 at 0.5 nm insulin, a more physiological insulin concentration (16Akirav E.M. Chan O. Inouye K. Riddell M.C.

(West Grove, PA). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA.11) was purified from ascites (Covance, Berkley, CA) using a protein G affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). The concentration of HA.11 required to saturate the HA epitope of HA-GLUT4-GFP was determined for each preparation of antibody by measuring cell-associated HA.11 antibody after a 10-min pulse at 37 °C. Typically, 50 μg/ml HA.11 was a saturating concentration. HA.11 and transferrin were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Biological Detection System, Pittsburg, PA). Monoclonal anti-GLUT4 antibody was a gift from Sam Cushman. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 cells were differentiated into adipocytes as described previously (18Subtil A. Lampson M.A. Keller S.R. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4787-4795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected by electroporation 5 days after differentiation and plated into coverslip bottom dishes (6Zeigerer A. Lampson M. Karylowski O. Sabatini D. Adesnik M. Ren M. McGraw T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Stable expression of HA-GLUT4 was achieved using the retroviral expression vector pBABE-Puro (19Shewan A. Marsh B. Melvin D. Martin S. Gould G. James D. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The pBABE HA-GLUT4 construct was a gift from David James. Retroviral stocks of HA-GLUT4 were generated using AmphoPack-293 cells (CloneTech, Mountain View, CA). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were infected with the virus in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene. After a 24-h recovery period, the cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin for 1 week. The selected cells were grown to confluence and differentiated. On day 5 after differentiation, cells were transferred to coverslip bottom dishes. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2/air during growth and differentiation and for all incubations in the kinetic experiments. All experiments were conducted on cells 6 days after differentiation unless noted otherwise. Fluorescence Quantification—All images were collected on a DMIRB inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems, Deerfield, IL) with a cooled charge-coupled device 12-bit camera (Princeton Instruments, West Chester, PA). Images for quantification of retrovirally infected cells were taken with a 10 × 0.30 numerical aperture dry objective. All other images were taken using a 40 × 1.25 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. Exposure times for each fluorescence channel were chosen such that >95% of the image pixel intensities were below camera saturation. Exposure times were kept constant within each experiment. Image quantification was done as described previously using Metamorph (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) image processing software (20Dunn K. Mayor S. Myers J. Maxfield F. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Lampson M.A. Racz A. Cushman S.W. McGraw T.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4065-4076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All images were background-corrected using nonexpressing cells. For transiently transfected cells, the background cells were chosen from within the same dish as the expressing cells. For stably transfected cells expressing HA-GLUT4, the background cells were collected from separate dishes of untransfected cells that were treated with antibodies in the same way as the transfected cells. Indirect Immunofluorescence—For indirect immunofluorescence, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, incubated with primary antibody in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2 (medium 1) with 250 μm saponin (for permeabilization) and 1% calf serum for 30 min at 37 °C, washed and incubated with fluorescent secondary antibody in medium 1/saponin/calf serum. Measurement of Total HA-GLUT4 Expression in Transiently Transfected Cells—Adipocytes transfected by eletroporation with HA-GLUT4 were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 220 mm bicarbonate and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (DMEMBB), supplemented with Cy3-HA.11 antibody and 170 nm insulin for 2 h to label the entire cycling pool of GLUT4. The cells were washed to remove unbound antibody and insulin and returned to basal during a 2-h incubation in DMEMBB (8Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The cell-associated Cy3 fluorescence is a measure of the total HA-GLUT4 expressed per cell (i.e. HA-GLUT4 recruited to the plasma membrane during the 2-h preincubation with Cy3-HA.11 and insulin). HA.11 binding does not alter GLUT4 trafficking, and it remains bound to the epitope during transit through intracellular compartments (5Lampson M.A. Schmoranzer J. Zeigerer A. Simon S.M. McGraw T.E.

GLUT4 Surface/Total Distribution—The procedure for measurement of HA-GLUT4-GFP translocation to the plasma membrane has been described (5Lampson M.A. Schmoranzer J. Zeigerer A. Simon S.M. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3489-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 6Zeigerer A. Lampson M. Karylowski O. Sabatini D. Adesnik M. Ren M. McGraw T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For translocation measurements of HA-GLUT4, the total HA-GLUT4 expressed by electroporation in individual adipocytes was measured by uptake of Cy3-HA.11 as described above. Cells were then either stimulated for 15 min with 170 nm insulin and fixed or immediately fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde (basal). HA-GLUT4 on the surface was measured by incubating the fixed cells with a Cy5-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody. The Cy5 fluorescence associated with surface-exposed HA.11 was normalized to total exogenously expressed GLUT4 per cell using the Cy3-HA.11. The surface/total ratio of exogenous GLUT4 was determined for 20 cells/condition/experiment. GLUT4 Trafficking Kinetics in Submaximal Insulin—We found that a large volume of insulin solution to cell density was required (e.g. 2 ml/∼5 × 104 cells) to maintain the steady-state surface/total distribution of GLUT4 in 0.5 nm insulin (supplemental Fig. 1A). The response of cells to insulin, as measured by redistribution of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, declined over time when cells were incubate in small volumes of 0.5 nm insulin (100 μl/∼5 × 104 cells; supplemental Fig. 1A). This effect was not observed when cells were incubated in small volumes of 200 nm insulin. The addition of a protease inhibitor mixture (catalog no. P1860; Sigma) (containing aprotinin, bestatin, E-64, leupeptin, and pepstatin) to the solution abrogated the decay of the 0.5 nm response (supplemental Fig. 1B). The protease inhibitor mixture had no effect on the response to 200 nm insulin (supplemental Fig. 1C). The protease inhibitor mixture was used at a 1:200 dilution. It is likely that a protease produced by the cells is degrading the insulin. The decline over time of the response of cells to insulin does not occur when incubating either with large volumes of insulin solution or with small volumes of high insulin concentration. In the experiments measuring the trafficking of GLUT4 in submaximal insulin, the protease inhibitor was added to the DMEMBB medium containing HA.11 antibody for incubations in a small volume longer than 45 min. GLUT4 Exocytosis—For experiments comparing the efflux of HA-GLUT4 and HA-GLUT4-GFP expressed by eletroporation, the entire pool of exogenous GLUT4 was prelabeled with Cy3-HA.11 as described above. Cells were incubated in DMEMBB and Cy5-goat anti-mouse antibody (basal) or prestimulated with 170 nm insulin for 15 min and then incubated in DMEMBB and Cy5-goat anti-mouse antibody (insulin). For each cell, the cell-associated Cy5-goat anti-mouse antibody fluorescence was normalized to the Cy3-HA.11 fluorescence. The Cy5/Cy3 ratio was determined for at least 20 cells/time point/experiment. For measurement of exocytosis of HA-GLUT4 expressed by retroviral infection, adipocytes were preincubated in DMEMBB for 2 h and then incubated in DMEMBB and HA.11 antibody in the presence or absence of 170 nm insulin. The amount of HA.11 taken up in a given amount of time was determined in fixed, saponin-permeabilized cells by staining with Cy3-goat anti-mouse antibody. Cell-associated HA.11 was determined for 20 fields of confluent cells (about 200 cells)/time point/condition. No correction for expression level was made because the average expression level/field was fairly constant. For experiments comparing the GLUT4 efflux in 0.5 nm versus 200 nm insulin, 3T3-L1 adipocytes electroporated with HA-GLUT4-GFP were incubated in DMEMBB for 2 h. Cells were prestimulated with 2 ml of insulin (200 or 0.5 nm) for 1 h. Following this, cells were incubated with a saturating concentration of HA.11 antibody in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture and insulin. The amount of HA.11 taken up in a given amount of time was determined by permeabilizing (250 μm saponin) the cells and staining with Cy3-goat anti-mouse antibody. Cy3 fluorescence was normalized for expression level of GLUT4 using GFP. Endocytosis—Internalization was measured using a modification of a previously published method (7Zeigerer A. McBrayer M.K. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4406-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in DMEMBB for 2 h, following which they were incubated in 2 ml of medium containing 0, 0.5, or 200 nm insulin for 1 h. The cells were then incubated in medium containing the 0.5 or 200 nm insulin and a saturating concentration of HA.11 for 3, 5, 7, or 9 min or in medium with no insulin and a saturating concentration of HA.11 for 10, 15, 20, or 30 min. After each time point, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and surface-exposed HA.11 was stained with a saturating concentration of Cy3-goat anti-mouse antibody. The cells were refixed, permeabilized with 250 μm saponin, and stained with Cy5-goat anti-mouse antibody to reveal all internal HA.11 (the Cy5-goat anti-mouse antibody used binds the same epitopes as the Cy3 antibody and therefore does not bind to the surface-exposed epitopes already bound by Cy3-goat anti-mouse antibody). For transferrin receptor (TR) internalization, cells electroporated with human transferrin receptor were incubated in DMEMBB for 210 min, with 200 nm insulin included for the last 30 min of incubation for half of the samples. Cells were incubated in DMEMBB and 10 μg/ml Cy5-transferrin with or without 200 nm insulin for 3, 5, 7, or 9 min. Cy5-transferrin bound to TR on the cell surface was removed by alternating acidic and neutral washes on ice (8Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Cy5-transferrin remaining cell-associated after these washes was the portion internalized during the incubations. The cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and TR on the plasma membrane was stained with monoclonal anti-TR antibody (B3/25). Cy3-goat anti-mouse antibody was used to detect the B3/25. For both GLUT4 and TR internalization experiments, the slope of the line generated by plotting the time-dependent increase in the ratio of the internal to surface fluorescence is proportional to the internalization rate. The Mechanism of Basal GLUT4 Retention: Dynamic or Static Retention?—It has previously been shown that the targeting of GLUT4 to the insulin-regulated pathway can be saturated at high levels of GLUT4 expression (22Marsh B.J. Alm R.A. McIntosh S.R. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Al-Hasani H. Yver D.R. Cushman S.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To determine whether targeting of HA-GLUT4-GFP to the specialized pathway is saturated at the expression levels achieved by electroporation, we compared HA-GLUT4-GFP expression with endogenous GLUT4 expression. The amount of total GLUT4/cell in 3T3-L1 adipocytes transiently transfected with HA-GLUT4-GFP was determined by quantitative indirect immunofluorescence (IF) using an antibody against the carboxyl cytoplasmic domain of GLUT4. The transfected cells expressing HA-GLUT4-GFP were identified by GFP fluorescence, and in these cells, total GLUT4 detected by IF is the sum of endogenous GLUT4 and HA-GLUT4-GFP. In cells that did not express HA-GLUT4-GFP (no GFP fluorescence), the IF signal reflects the amount of endogenous GLUT4 alone. The overall morphology of the GLUT4 compartments was perinuclear with small punctuate structures around the periphery of the cell and was unaltered by the expression of exogenous GLUT4 (Fig. 1A). Total GLUT4 in cells expressing HA-GLUT4-GFP was about 2-fold greater than in cells expressing endogenous GLUT4 alone (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that, on average, HA-GLUT4-GFP was expressed at the same level as endogenous GLUT4. Analysis of the data on a cell-by-cell basis revealed that: (a) the range of expression of total GLUT4 in cells expressing HA-GLUT4-GFP was similar to that observed for endogenous GLUT4; (b) in both cases, the distribution of GLUT4 expression was normal; and (c) only a small fraction of the transfected cells (less than 10%) expressed total GLUT4 to a level that was greater than the range of endogenous expression in untransfected cells (Fig. 1C). For the IF to be a valid measure of the relative expression of HA-GLUT4-GFP and endogenous GLUT4, the affinity of the antibody for the two proteins must be similar. We examined the effect of varying the antibody concentration on the ratio of HA-GLUT4-GFP and endogenous GLUT4 to endogenous GLUT4. If the affinity of the anti-GLUT4 antibody is lower for HA-GLUT4-GFP than for endogenous GLUT4, this ratio will decrease as the concentration of antibody decreases. Decreasing the antibody concentration did not significantly decrease the ratio (Fig. 1D), indicating that the affinity of the anti-GLUT4 antibody used is similar for HA-GLUT4-GFP and for endogenous GLUT4. To directly examine the relationship between the amount of HA-GLUT4-GFP expressed and its intracellular retention, we correlated, on an individual cell basis, the basal surface-to-total ratio (Cy3/GFP) of HA-GLUT4-GFP to the amount of HA-GLUT4-GFP expressed (Fig. 1E). There was no increase in the Cy3/GFP ratio in the cells that express more of the HA-GLUT4-GFP (higher GFP signal), as would be expected if, at levels of expression, retention was saturated. These data demonstrate that HA-GLUT4-GFP expressed by electroporation does not saturate the basal retention mechanism. HA-GLUT4-GFP is a convenient reporter for endogenous GLUT4 because the GFP provides a way to normalize the distribution of HA-GLUT4-GFP to the expression level per cell (6Zeigerer A. Lampson M. Karylowski O. Sabatini D. Adesnik M. Ren M. McGraw T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 21Lampson M.A. Racz A. Cushman S.W. McGraw T.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4065-4076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the carboxyl terminus of GLUT4 contains sequences essential for the proper trafficking and localization of GLUT4 (19Shewan A. Marsh B. Melvin D. Martin S. Gould G. James D. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Verhey K.J. Yeh J.I. Birnbaum M.J. J.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1705-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is therefore possible that the GFP interferes with the function of these signals. Our previous assessment that HA-GLUT4-GFP traffics like endogenous GLUT4 was based on comparisons of insulin-stimulated translocation (5Lampson M.A. Schmoranzer J. Zeigerer A. Simon S.M. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3489-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 6Zeigerer A. Lampson M. Karylowski O. Sabatini D. Adesnik M. Ren M. McGraw T. Mol. Biol.

To more completely assess possible effects of the carboxyl-terminal GFP, we examined the behavior of the HA-GLUT4 construct by electroporation (27Quon M.J. Guerre-Millo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To analyze the trafficking of HA-GLUT4 transiently expressed by electroporation, the total expression of the construct was measured by incubating cells for 2 h at 37 °C in medium with insulin and Cy3-HA.11, followed by a 2-h, 37 °C incubation in medium without insulin to return to basal conditions (supplemental Fig. 2). This method of measuring total expression was validated by comparing the translocation of HA-GLUT4-GFP using either GFP or Cy3-HA.11 as a measure of total HA-GLUT4-GFP expression (supplemental Fig. 2). Basal retention and insulin-stimulated translocation were similar whether the Cy3 or GFP fluorescence was used, indicating that prelabeling GLUT4 with Cy3-HA.11 at the start of the experiment does not perturb HA-GLUT4-GFP trafficking, and therefore it can be used to normalize for exogenous GLUT4 expression. Furthermore, translocation of HA-GLUT4-GFP prebound by HA.11 is within the range observed for translocation of HA-GLUT4-GFP unbound by HA.11, confirming that antibody binding does not detectably alter HA-GLUT4-GFP trafficking (5Lampson M.A. Schmoranzer J. Zeigerer A. Simon S.M. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3489-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 6Zeigerer A. Lampson M. Karylowski O. Sabatini D. Adesnik M. Ren M. McGraw T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 8Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Next, we compared the translocation of HA-GLUT4 to HA-GLUT4-GFP as a means of assessing the effect of the carboxyl-terminal GFP. Cells, preincubated with Cy3-HA.11 at 37 °C to label total HA-GLUT4, were fixed, and surface-exposed HA.11 was detected with Cy5-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody. There was no difference in the magnitude of insulin-stimulated translocation of these two constructs to the cell surface, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal GFP does not globally alter the trafficking of GLUT4 in either basal or insulin-stimulated conditions (Fig. 2A). To examine the exocytosis of the HA-GLUT4 in more detail, we measured the basal efflux kinetics. Cells preincubated with Cy3-HA.11 to label total HA-GLUT4 were incubated at 37 °C for varying times with Cy5-goat anti-mouse antibody (basal) or pretreated with insulin for 15 min and then incubated with Cy5-goat anti-mouse antibody at 37 °C in the presence of insulin for varying times (insulin). The HA.11·HA-GLUT4 complex that cycles to the plasma membrane is bound by the Cy5-goat anti-mouse antibody; therefore, a rise in the Cy5/Cy3 ratio over time reflects the exocytosis of HA-GLUT4 to the cell surface, with this ratio reaching a plateau when all of the cycling HA-GLUT4 has equilibrated with the plasma membrane (8Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 28Ghosh R.N. Mallet W.G. Soe T.T. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 923-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The plateau level reached after about 6 h of incubation in basal conditions was similar to the plateau reached after 1 h in the presence of insulin, providing evidence that the basal cycling pool of HA-GLUT4 is similar in size to the pool recruited by insulin (Fig. 2B). The half-time to reach the plateau in the basal state was similar to what was previously seen for HA-GLUT4-GFP (8Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with our previous experiments demonstrating that GLUT4 effluxes slowly in the basal state and quickly in the insulin state, and they demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal GFP of the HA-GLUT4-GFP reporter does not affect the exocytosis kinetics of GLUT4. To determine whether the method of expression of the reporter had an effect on the behavior of GLUT4 in basal conditions, we studied the behavior of HA-GLUT4 expressed by retroviral infection. The average expression level of total GLUT4 in cells infected with a retrovirus coding for HA-GLUT4 was less than twice that of endogenous GLUT4 in control cells (Fig. 3A). The efflux kinetics of HA-GLUT4 in the basal and the insulin-stimulated states were measured using a modification of the HA.11 antibody uptake assay discussed above. Day 5 adipocytes expressing HA-GLUT4 were incubated at 37 °C for various times in DMEMBB containing HA.11 (without prior pretreatment with insulin). At each time point, the amount of cell-associated HA.11 was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. The expression level of HA-GLUT4 within an individual cell was not accounted for, since the average expression level did not vary significantly from dish to dish within an experiment. As was the case for HA-GLUT4 expressed by electroporation (Fig. 2B), in basal conditions HA-GLUT4 expressed by retroviral expression cycles to the cell surface with a halftime of about 3–4 h (Fig. 3B). The same plateau level of labeling was reached in the basal as in the insulin-stimulated state. After 10 h of uptake, the HA.11 is localized to the perinuclear region of the cell in a pattern that corresponds to the pattern of endogenous GLUT4 staining in untransfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3C). Therefore, HA-GLUT4 expressed by retroviral infection is in equilibrium with the plasma membrane in the basal state to the same extent as in insulin-stimulated conditions, only with significantly slower kinetics, as we have previously reported for HA-GLUT4-GFP expressed by electroporation. Intermediate GLUT4 Redistribution Is Achieved by Submaximal Stimulation of Exocytosis and Submaximal Inhibition of Endocytosis—To analyze the behavior of GLUT4 in submaximal insulin concentrations, we first determined that 0.5 nm insulin promoted an approximate half-maximal redistribution of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4A). A similar half-maximal insulin concentration for stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes has been reported (29Gibbs E.M. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16597-16603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The average intermediate response of the population of cells could result from individual cells responding to an intermediate extent or heterogeneity in the population of cells, with some cells responding fully and others not at all. To address this question, the results from the experiments in Fig. 4A were analyzed on a cell-by-cell basis. In the majority of cells treated with 0.5 nm insulin, the amount of GLUT4 on the surface was intermediate between basal and the 200 nm, indicating that the partial translocation is due to individual cells responding to an intermediate extent (Fig. 4B). We next measured the time required to achieve a new surface steadystate level of HA-GLUT4-GFP in 0.5 nm insulin. The time required to reach the plateau level in surface HA-GLUT4-GFP was longer in 0.5 nm than in 200 nm insulin (Fig. 4C). This difference is unlikely to be due entirely to a delay in the signaling from the insulin receptor, since the half-time of the initiation of the signaling cascade, 1.5 min for IRS in 10 and 100 nm insulin (30Sedaghat A.R. Sherman A. Quon M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E1084-E1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 31Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 32Giorgetti S. Ballotti R. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Cormont M. Van Obberghen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), is fast compared with the time needed to reach the steady-state distribution of GLUT4. Additionally, because of the amplification of the signal, the sensitivity to insulin increases for the molecules further downstream in the signaling cascade (30Sedaghat A.R. Sherman A. Quon M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E1084-E1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The observed slower rate of response to 0.5 nm insulin may instead be the consequence of slower overall kinetics of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane. If the rate of GLUT4 efflux is slower, then it will take longer to accumulate enough GLUT4 at the plasma membrane to reach the new surface population level. We next measured the steady-state efflux rate of GLUT4 in the presence of 0.5 nm insulin. The cells were preincubated for 1 h, at 37 °C, with insulin to ensure that GLUT4 trafficking between the interior and surface of cells was at steady state. The halftime to reach the plateau was longer in 0.5 nm insulin than in 200 nm insulin, establishing that the overall exocytosis kinetics in submaximal insulin are slower (Fig. 5A). Both the 200 and 0.5 nm insulin curves fit well to a single exponential, indicating that GLUT4 is cycling as a single kinetic pool under both conditions. The plateau level reached was the same in 0.5 nm insulin as in 200 nm insulin, demonstrating that, as in basal conditions, the entire intracellular pool recruited to the plasma membrane in 200 nm insulin was recruited in submaximal insulin conditions, just with different kinetics. We conclude that an intermediate steady-state surface-to-total GLUT4 distribution is the result of the entire pool of GLUT4 cycling to the plasma membrane at a net intermediate rate. Another parameter of GLUT4 trafficking regulated by insulin is its internalization (7Zeigerer A. McBrayer M.K. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4406-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 12Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Czech M.P. Buxton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9187-9190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin inhibition of GLUT4 internalization contributes to the net accumulation of GLUT4 on the cell surface. We found that GLUT4 internalization was inhibited by about 70% in 200 nm insulin and about 50% in 0.5 nm insulin (Fig. 5B). Thus, like exocytosis, submaximal insulin mediates an intermediate effect on GLUT4 internalization kinetics, indicating that regulation of endocytosis and exocytosis is gradated rather then binary. To determine whether the effect of insulin on internalization is specific to GLUT4, and not a general perturbation of membrane trafficking, we measured the effect of insulin on TR internalization. We found that TR internalization was not slowed by the presence of insulin. There was actually a slight increase in the internalization rate in the presence of 200 nm insulin (Fig. 5C). This may be due to a general increase in membrane flux in the presence of insulin (34Gibbs E.M. Lienhard G.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 121: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The effect of insulin on slowing internalization is therefore specific to GLUT4. The results of this study demonstrate that intracellular GLUT4 is in equilibrium with the plasma membrane in basal adipocytes and that insulin stimulates this exchange rate. Our data show that neither attachment of GFP on the carboxyl terminus of GLUT4 nor the means of transfection, electroporation or retroviral infection, detectably influence the trafficking behavior of the GLUT4 reporters. These data provide additional support for the dynamic, bipartite retention model (8Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The dynamic, bipartite mechanism of GLUT4 retention proposed here is not unlike other retention mechanisms used in the cell. Retention of ER- and Golgi-resident proteins is achieved by repeated cycles of release and retrieval (35Lee M.C. Miller E.A. Goldberg J. Orci L. Schekman R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 87-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 36Sannerud R. Saraste J. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Even in the tightly regulated system of synaptic vesicle release, a basal current is maintained during the unstimulated state (37Sara Y. Virmani T. Deak F. Liu X. Kavalali E.T. Neuron. 2005; 45: 563-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The dynamic bipartite nature of such systems may facilitate the ability of the cell to respond rapidly to acute environmental changes. This retention mechanism might be expected to be analogous to a rheostat. By having a resistor on the system that can change the “current” allowed to flow through the system, without ever cutting off the flow entirely, the system would remain in continual motion and thus be more sensitive to changes. Perhaps it is more efficient for a cell to make kinetic changes in an already mobile system than to continually stop and start the system. To further our understanding of insulin action, we examined GLUT4 trafficking at submaximal concentrations of insulin. Such studies can provide a glimpse of the transition state between the basal and maximal insulin states and thus help us to build a better model of the mechanism of insulin action. Additionally, most studies of GLUT4 trafficking in 3T3-L1 adipocytes have made comparisons between basal (no insulin) and insulin concentrations greater than 100 nm. These experimental conditions probably do not reflect normal physiologic conditions (16Akirav E.M. Chan O. Inouye K. Riddell M.C. Matthews S.G. Vranic M. Metabolism. 2004; 53: 1558-1564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The submaximal concentration of insulin (0.5 nm) used in this study is within the physiological range (16Akirav E.M. Chan O. Inouye K. Riddell M.C. Matthews S.G. Vranic M. Metabolism. 2004; 53: 1558-1564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Satoh H. Nguyen M.T. Trujillo M. Imamura T. Usui I. Scherer P.E. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1304-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We found that the cellular distribution of GLUT4 in submaximal insulin conditions, like in basal, and maximal insulin conditions is established by changes in the rate of exchange of GLUT4 between the intracellular storage pool and the plasma membrane. The mechanism of insulin action is dependent on the modulation of kinetic rates of GLUT4 trafficking at multiple steps of the pathway. These results are consistent with a gradated transition from the basal to the maximal insulin stimulated state; as the concentration of insulin is increased, there is a proportional increase in the efflux rate and a decrease in the internalization rate. The submaximal insulin studies establish that the models for GLUT4 trafficking developed using extreme insulin concentrations (no insulin and greater than 100 nm insulin) are applicable to the behavior of GLUT4 in an insulin concentration more in the physiological range, 0.5 nm. The consequence of this bipartite mechanism of regulation of GLUT4 distribution can be better understood by examining a three-dimensional model of the calculated fraction of GLUT4 on the cell surface for any given set of exocytosis and endocytosis rate constants based on the equation, GLUT4Surface/GLUT4Total = 1/(1 + (kEndocytosis/kExocytosis)). The shape of the contour plot of plasma membrane GLUT4 as a function of varying exocytosis and endocytosis constants illustrates that within the range of rate constants found in the basal state (noted by red bars along the x and y axes), small changes in either parameter do not have a large impact on the surface level of GLUT4 (Fig. 6). In contrast, within the range of rate constants measured in insulin-stimulated adipocytes (noted by blue bars along the x and y axes), the change in plasma membrane GLUT4 is considerably steeper, and therefore the system has an increased sensitivity to small changes in rate constants. Thus, the insulin concentration may regulate not only the amount of GLUT4 on the cell surface but also the sensitivity of the system to insulin.

Whereas the expression and function of this pathway has been documented during mammalian development, evidence demonstrating the physiologic importance of this pathway in murine preimplantation embryos is beginning to emerge. This study demonstrates that inhibition of the PI3K pathway leads to the induction of apoptosis in both murine blastocysts and trophoblast stem cells. The apoptosis induced in both model systems correlates with a decrease in the expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 at the plasma membrane. In addition, blastocysts cultured in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY-294002 display a decrease in both 2-deoxyglucose uptake and hexokinase activity as compared with control blastocysts. To determine the impact of PI3K inhibition on pregnancy outcome, embryo transfer experiments were performed. Blastocysts cultured in the presence of LY-294002 demonstrate a dramatic increase in fetal resorptions as compared with control embryos. Finally, we demonstrate that impairment of glucose metabolism via iodoacetate, a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor, is sufficient to induce apoptosis in both blastocysts and trophoblast stem cells. Moreover, blastocysts treated with iodoacetate result in poor pregnancy outcome as determined by embryo transfer experiments.

The blastocyst stage of murine preimplantation development occurs approximately 4 days post-fertilization. At this stage of embryonic development the first cell differentiation step has occurred. The blastocyst is comprised of the epithelial trophectoderm, which is the layer of cells that develop into the placenta, and the inner cell mass, which consists of the pluripotent cells that gives rise to the embryo proper. Prior to implantation, the developing embryo is dependent on signals generated by growth factors that are either made by the embryo itself or are present in the maternal environment.

The phosphorylation of phosphoinositides by PI3K results in the recruitment of the serine-threonine kinase Akt to the plasma membrane. Once at the membrane Akt itself becomes phosphorylated and thus activated and can go on to phosphorylate downstream targets including both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins (17Alessi D.R.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, active forms of Akt have been shown to stimulate the activity of hexokinase, the first enzyme in the glycolytic pathway (25Gottlob K. Majewski N. Kennedy S. Kandel E. Robey R.B. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1406-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 26Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Plas D.R. Hammerman P.S. Cinalli R.M. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7315-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Thus in some cell types the PI3K/Akt pathway regulates glycolysis by controlling both glucose entry into the cell via the expression of glucose transporters at the cell surface and by regulating the activity of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. The PI3K/Akt pathway has been examined during different developmental processes, however, relatively little is known about this pathway during the preimplantation period. This is a critical stage during development as several studies have suggested that perturbations in glucose and amino acid metabolism may have long lasting effects on later development (27Chi M.M. Pingsterhaus J. Carayannopoulos M. Moley K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40252-40257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28Lane M. Gardner D.K. Biol.

Previously we demonstrated that the 85-kDa regulatory subunit and the 110-kDa catalytic subunit of PI3K as well as the serine-threonine kinase Akt are expressed from the 1-cell through the blastocyst stage of murine preimplantation embryo development (32Riley J.K. Carayannopoulos M.O. Wyman A.H. Chi M. Ratajczak C.K. Moley K.H. Dev. Biol. 2005; 284: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These proteins are localized predominantly at the cell surface from the 1-cell through the morula stage. At a blastocyst stage, both PI3K and Akt exhibit a largely apical staining pattern suggesting that these proteins are expressed on the apical surface of the polarized trophectoderm cells. Interestingly, we found that Akt is phosphorylated throughout murine preimplantation development implying that this pathway is being continuously activated by endogenous growth factors during this early developmental period. Prior studies demonstrated the importance of the PI3K pathway for cell survival during the preimplantation period. Deletion of the p110β subunit of PI3K leads to early embryonic lethality (33Bi L. Okabe I. Bernard D.J. Nussbaum R.L. Mamm. Genome. 2002; 13: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). There is a deficit in the number of homozygous knock-out embryos detected at E3.5 (blastocyst stage) implying that this protein is important during early development. In addition, studies have shown that the inhibition of PI3K leads to decreased numbers of embryos that develop to the morula and blastocyst stage when cultured in vitro and to the induction of apoptosis during this developmental period (34Lu D.P. Chandrakanthan V. Cahana A. Ishii S. O'Neill C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1567-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 35Gross V.S. Hess M. Cooper G.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2005; 70: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Previously we showed that inhibition of PI3K activity also has significant effects on the normal physiology of the blastocyst. Specifically, inhibition of this pathway results in decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (32Riley J.K. Carayannopoulos M.O. Wyman A.H. Chi M. Ratajczak C.K. Moley K.H. Dev. Biol. 2005; 284: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibiting PI3K activity results in a significant delay in blastocyst hatching, a developmental step required for implantation. We also determined that trophoblast stem cells express the functional proteins of the PI3K pathway making this a useful in vitro model to study this signaling cascade. To date, however, there is no data regarding the physiologic and mechanistic impact of inhibiting the PI3K pathway on glucose uptake and metabolism in preimplantation embryos and the effect on later developmental potential. Therefore in this study the physiologic importance of this pathway for glucose metabolism and embryo survival in the murine preimplantation blastocyst and in a TS cell line is examined. These experiments demonstrate that the PI3K pathway inhibits apoptosis in both murine blastocysts and trophoblast stem cells. Inhibition of this pathway leads to the induction of apoptosis, associated with a decrease in GLUT1 expression at the plasma membrane and with a decrease in glucose uptake and hexokinase activity. Notably, inhibition of the PI3K pathway at the blastocyst stage results in increased fetal resorptions as well; suggesting that short-term inhibition at the blastocyst stage results in later pregnancy failure. We demonstrate that impairment of glucose metabolism alone is sufficient to induce apoptosis in both blastocysts and TS cells. Moreover, the inhibition of glycolysis at the blastocyst stage results in poor pregnancy outcome. Thus, elucidating the functional importance of the PI3K pathway in maintaining glucose metabolism during preimplantation development is critical for understanding the mechanisms involved in preimplantation embryo survival and reproductive success. Embryo Recovery and Culture—Embryos were recovered as previously described (36Moley K.H. Chi M. Mueckler M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E38-E47PubMed Google Scholar). In short, three-week-old female mice (B6×SJL F1, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were given free access to food and water and were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Female mice were superovulated with an intraperitoneal injection of 10 IU/animal of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (Sigma) followed 48 h later by 10 IU/animal of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, Sigma). Female mice were mated with males of proven fertility overnight following the hCG injection. Mating was confirmed by identification of a vaginal plug. Mice were sacrificed 96 h post-hCG injection to recover embryos at the blastocyst stage. Embryos were recovered by flushing dissected uterine horns and ostia with human tubal fluid medium (HTF, Irvine Scientific, Santa Anna, CA) containing 0.25% BSA (bovine serum albumin fraction V, Sigma). To determine the effect of the PI3K inhibitor 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride (LY-294002 hydrochloride, Sigma) on apoptosis induction, GLUT1 expression, basal glucose uptake, and hexokinase activity blastocysts were harvested 96 h post-hCG injection and subsequently incubated in vitro for an additional 30 h in HTF plus Me2SO (also known as DMSO; vehicle control) (Sigma) or HTF supplemented with 250 μm LY-294002. To determine the effect of the GAPDH inhibitor sodium iodoacetate (Sigma) on apoptosis induction, blastocysts were harvested 96 h post-hCG injection and subsequently incubated in vitro for an additional 30 h in HTF media alone or HTF supplemented with 2.5, 5, or 7 μm iodoacetate. These experiments were conducted at least three times each. All procedures described above were reviewed and approved by the animal studies committee at Washington University and were performed in accordance with IACUC approval. Cells—Primary TS cells were a generous gift from Dr. Leonidas Carayannopoulos (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and were generated from C57/B6 mice following published protocols (37Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). To confirm the trophoblast lineage of this cell line, several genetic markers were analyzed. These markers included two TS-specific genes, Errβ and Hand1, which were both expressed in this cell line, one embryonic stem cell-specific marker, Oct3/4, which was not expressed in this cell line and one mesoderm-specific gene, T Brachyury, which was not expressed in this cell line. TS cells were maintained in the absence of mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder layers, cultured instead in the presence of mouse embryonic fibroblast conditioned media. Briefly cells were grown in 70% feeder-conditioned medium and 30% TS medium supplemented with fibroblast growth factor-4 (25 ng/ml) (Sigma) and heparin (1 μg/ml) (Sigma). TS medium consisted of 20% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Cambrex BioScience, Walkersville, MD), 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine (Cambrex BioScience), and 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Cambrex BioScience) in RPMI 1640 (Cambrex BioScience). To generate feeder-conditioned medium, mouse embryo fibroblasts were irradiated (5000 Rads) and plated in 10-cm dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml in TS medium (10 ml/plate). The cells were cultured for at least 72 h and the media was subsequently collected. Floating cells were removed from the cultured medium via centrifugation and the medium was then 0.22-μm filtered and stored at -20 °C. TS cells were cultured in either Me2SO or 150 μm LY-294002 for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h or HTF media alone or 20 μm IA for 6, 12, and 24 h and the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined using the TUNEL assay followed by flow cytometry. In experiments that examined the effect of LY-294002 on GLUT1 surface expression, TS cells were cultured in either Me2SO or 150 μm LY-294002 for 12 h and plasma membrane fractions were subsequently isolated and analyzed by Western blot. These experiments were conducted at least three times each and the results shown are from one representative experiment. TUNEL Assay—Apoptosis was assayed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling (TUNEL) as previously described (38Moley K.H. Chi M.M.-Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Mueckler M.M. Nature Med. 1998; 12: 1421-1424Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Embryos were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 20 min and then permeabilized in 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) for 30 min. TS cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 1 h and then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 2 min. Apoptosis was assessed using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, TMR (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After the TUNEL assay was performed the nuclei of the embryos were stained using 4 μm To-Pro-3-iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 20 min. In experiments in which the embryos were both immunofluorescently labeled and the TUNEL assay was performed, the TUNEL assay was performed first followed by antibody staining of the embryos. A Z-series consisting of 5 sections was taken for each embryo using a Nikon C1 laser-scanning confocal microscope. The total number of nuclei and apoptotic nuclei per embryo were quantitated manually for each Z-series. The sum of the apoptotic nuclei and total nuclei within each treatment group was then utilized to calculate the percentage of TUNEL positive nuclei per embryo. This experiment was performed at least three times with a minimum of 5 embryos per group. Flow Cytometry—TS cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 106 per 10-cm dish. The cells were cultured in the presence of Me2SO or 150 μm LY-294002 or HTF media alone or 20 μm IA for 6, 12, or 24 h. The TS cells were subsequently harvested, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the TUNEL assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cells were analyzed using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). An arbitrary gate was drawn and the percentage of cells within the gate was determined using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). This experiment was performed at least three times and the results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake and Hexokinase Assay—Glucose uptake into single blastocysts was measured using a nonradioactive microanalytic procedure described previously (36Moley K.H. Chi M. Mueckler M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E38-E47PubMed Google Scholar, 39Chi M.M.-Y. Manchester J.K. Carter J.G. Pusateri M.E. McDougal D.B. Lowry O.H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In short, blastocysts after 30 h in culture in the presence of Me2SO or 250 μm LY-294002 were incubated at 25 °C in 200 μm 2-deoxyglucose for 15 min, washed in 2-deoxyglucose- and BSA-free buffer for 1 min, and then were quick-frozen on a glass slide. After freeze drying overnight, the embryos were extracted in microliter volumes under oil and assayed for 2-deoxyglucose as described previously. The final measurements are expressed as picomoles per embryo per 15 min. Experiments were performed in triplicate on 20 individual embryos per group for each experiment and the results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. For the hexokinase measurements, embryos were treated as described above and hexokinase levels were measured on individual blastocysts as described previously (40Passonneau J.L. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis. Humana Press, To-towa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar). Hexokinase activity is expressed as picomoles per embryo per hour. This experiment was performed at least three times with a minimum of 20 embryos per treatment group and the results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Immunofluorescent Staining—Immunofluorescence staining techniques have been described for embryo preparations previously (36Moley K.H. Chi M. Mueckler M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E38-E47PubMed Google Scholar). All labeling was performed in microdroplets. Embryos were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 20 min and then permeabilized in 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) for 30 min. The embryos were subsequently blocked for 1 h with 20% normal goat serum (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin (PBS/BSA). Embryos were then washed three times for 10 min each in PBS/BSA and then incubated for 40 min in 20 μg/ml of one of the following antibodies: anti-GLUT1 (kindly provided by Dr. Michael Mueckler, Washington University), or anti-GLUT3 (kindly provided by Dr. Sherin Devaskar, Los Angeles, CA). The embryos were then washed three times for 10 min each in PBS/BSA and incubated with the secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) at a concentration of 2 μg/ml for 30 min followed by 4 μm To-Pro-3-iodide (Molecular Probes), a nuclear stain, for 20 min. Finally the embryos were washed three times for 10 min each in PBS and mounted in drops of Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) under a coverslip. Fluorescence was detected with a Nikon C1 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Confocal images were taken at ×63 magnification. These experiments were performed three times with at least 5 embryos per group for each experiment. Plasma Membrane Preparation—TS cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 106/10-cm dish. The cells were cultured in the presence of either Me2SO or 150 μm LY-294002 for 12 h. The TS cells were subsequently harvested, washed once in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 255 mm sucrose), and then resuspended in homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitors (HB+PI) (EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA). The cells were lysed using a Dounce homogenizer and then centrifuged at 1,750 × g for 10 min. The pellet was then rehomogenized and centrifuged and the pooled supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of HB+PI and homogenized using a Dounce. The homogenate was overlaid on a 38.5% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 33,000 × g for 1 h. The interface containing the plasma membrane fraction was collected and diluted with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The membrane fraction was centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 1 h. The plasma membrane pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris and the protein level was quantitated. Protein contents were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). 2 μg of protein was loaded per lane on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by Western blot using an anti-GLUT1 antibody. The membrane was simultaneously probed with an anti-actin antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) to normalize for protein loading. Embryo Transfers—Blastocysts were harvested as described above and then cultured in vitro for 24 h in HTF/BSA containing either Me2SO or 250 μm LY-294002 or HTF media alone or 2.5 μm IA. Unhatched blastocysts were then transferred back into the uterine horn of pseudopregnant female recipient mice at 2.5 days post coitum (41Nagy A. Gertsenstein M. Vintersten K. Behringer R. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual.Third Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003Google Scholar). 8-10 blastocysts were transferred to a single uterine horn, resulting in 16-20 embryos per recipient. The mice were sacrificed and the embryos examined at E14.5. Four independent experiments were performed. A total of 7 control mice with 72 implantation sites and 8 LY-294002 mice with 121 implantation sites were analyzed. For the IA transfer experiments four independent experiments were performed. A total of 7 control mice with 87 implantation sites and 7 IA mice with 78 implantation sites were analyzed. The percentage of fetal resorption per mouse was calculated by dividing the number of resorptions by the total number of implantation sites. The per mouse resorption percentage was then averaged for the control or the treated group over all four experiments. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical Analysis—Differences between Me2SO and LY-294002 and control and IA-induced apoptosis in blastocysts were analyzed using analysis of variance with a Fisher’s post-hoc test, whereas differences in TS cell apoptosis were analyzed using analysis of variance with a Bonferoni/Dunn post-hoc test (Statview 4.5, Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Differences in 2-deoxyglucose uptake, hexokinase activity, and fetal resorption percentages between Me2SO- and LY-294002-treated blastocysts were analyzed using an unpaired Student’s t test. Differences in fetal resorption percentages for control versus IA-treated blastocysts were analyzed using an unpaired Student’s t test. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Previously we and others demonstrated that the PI3K pathway is present and functional during murine preimplantation development (32Riley J.K. Carayannopoulos M.O. Wyman A.H. Chi M. Ratajczak C.K.

Reprod. 2005; 73: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); however, there is still relatively little data regarding the physiologic ramifications of inhibiting this pathway in preimplantation embryos. Because of the connection between the PI3K signal transduction pathway, growth factors, and cell survival in other systems (18Thompson J.E. Thompson C.B. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22: 4217-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 43Katso R. Okkenhaug K. Ahmadi K. White S. Timms J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 615-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), we first investigated whether inhibition of PI3K results in the induction of apoptosis. Blastocysts were cultured in vitro in either Me2SO (vehicle control) or increasing concentrations of the PI3K inhibitor LY-294002 and the TUNEL assay was performed. A dose-dependent increase in the percentage of apoptotic nuclei per blastocyst was seen (Fig. 1A). The number of TUNEL-positive nuclei per embryo was quantitated and found to be 4.0 (±0.9) and 18.6% (±3.1) (p < 0.001) at the 250 and 500 μm doses of LY-294002, respectively (Fig. 1B).

Fourteen mutant PanK2 proteins with single amino acid substitutions, associated with either early or late onset disease, were evaluated for activity. The PanK2(G521R), the most frequent mutation in pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, was devoid of activity and did not fold properly. However, nine of the mutant proteins associated with disease possessed catalytic activities that were indistinguishable from wild type, including the frequently encountered PanK2(T528M) missense mutation. PanK2 was extremely sensitive to feedback inhibition by CoA thioesters (IC50 values between 250 and 500 nm), and the regulation of the active PanK2 mutants was comparable with that of the wild-type protein. Coexpression of the PanK2(G521R) and wild-type PanK2 did not interfere with wild-type enzyme activity, arguing against a dominant negative effect of the PanK2(G521R) mutation in heterozygous patients.

PKAN patients have a pathological accumulation of iron in the basal ganglia and a combination of motor symptoms in the form of dystonia, dysarthria, intellectual impairment, and gait disturbance (3Thomas M.

Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the clinical sequelae associated with an assumed loss of PanK2 activity: accumulation of cysteine-containing substrates because of the inhibition of CoA synthesis, which may undergo rapid auto-oxidation in the presence of iron, leading to free radical generation and cell damage (1Zhou B.

The PanK2 protein translated from the most 5′ start site is sequentially cleaved at two sites by the mitochondrial processing peptidase, generating a long-lived 48-kDa mature protein (10Kotzbauer P.T. Truax A.C. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.Y J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Two shorter PanK2 isoforms have been described, the first one also localizes to mitochondria (5Johnson M.A. Kuo Y.M. Westaway S.K. Parker S.M. Ching K.H. Gitschier J. Hayflick S.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Genet. 2003; 12: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The PKAN mutations described thus far occur in the coding sequence of the shorter mitochondrial form (1Zhou B. Westaway S.K. Levinson B. Johnson M.A. Gitschier J. Hayflick S.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 4Hayflick S.J. Westaway S.K. Levinson B. Zhou B. Johnson M.A. Ching K.H. Gitschier J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), and it is thought that early onset patients tend to have more severe mutations resulting in truncated PanK2 proteins, whereas the later onset patients would have mutations with amino acid changes that compromise activity (12Hayflick S.J. J. Neurol. Sci. 2003; 207: 106-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cell lines expressing three of the PanK2 mutant proteins have decreased activity, although cell lines expressing three other mutants appear active (10Kotzbauer P.T. Truax A.C. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.Y J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), raising questions about the relationship between PanK2 activity and the PKAN phenotypes. Disruption of the Pank2 gene in mice does not produce a neurodegenerative phenotype (13Kuo Y.M. Duncan J.L. Westaway S.K. Yang H. Nune G. Xu E.Y. Hayflick S.J. Gitschier J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), although it does result in retinal degeneration, often linked with the human disease, and azoospermia, which is also associated with reduced PanK activity in Drosophila melanogaster (14Afshar K. Gonczy P. DiNardo S. Wasserman S.A. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of understanding the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of this disorder prompted us to examine the biochemical and regulatory properties of the PanK2 isoforms and a comprehensive set of the most frequently encountered mutant proteins. Cloning of the Human PanK2—The splice variant of PanK2 (spPanK2) was amplified by PCR from a human brain Marathon-Ready cDNA library (BD Biosciences). The forward primer (spPanK2-F) (Table 1) contained an NheI restriction site, and the reverse primer (PanK2-R) contained an EcoRI restriction site downstream of the stop codon. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR2.1 and sequenced. The NheI- and EcoRI-digested fragment was then ligated into pcDNA3.1(–), and the resultant plasmid was named pKM3 (Table 2). The full-length PanK2 (pPanK2) was assembled from two ESTs of the human cDNA obtained from ATCC, EST 603204447F1 (Image clone ID 5270218; GenBank™ accession number BI463406) and EST 603241690F1 (Image clone ID 5284174; GenBank™ accession number BI544308). The iPanK2 constructed for this work was based on the predicted cleavage site of pPanK2 at position 44 (11Hortnagel K. Prokisch H. Meitinger T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). After our work was completed, the actual cleavage site was determined to be at amino acid position 32, upstream of the predicted site (10Kotzbauer P.T. Truax A.C. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.Y J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, our iPanK2 constructs lack 12 amino acids at the N terminus that are present in the cellular intermediate (iPanK2). An NheI restriction site was introduced upstream of the Kozak sequence with primers pPanK2-F, iPanK2-F1, and sPanK2-F to clone the pPanK2, iPanK2, and sPanK2 between the NheI and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1(–) to yield pKM4, pKM5, and pKM31, respectively. iPanK2 was also expressed with an N-terminal His tag from pKM7, which was constructed by ligation of the iPanK2 sequence into pcDNA3.1-HisA within a KpnI (introduced by primer iPanK2-F2) and the EcoRI sites. Plasmid pKM56 contained the mature form of PanK2 with an N-terminal His tag cloned into pcDNA3.1-HisA.TABLE 1Primers used in this studyPrimerSequence (5′-3′, restriction site underlined)spPanK2-FGGCTAGCACCATGCCTGCTTTTATTCAAATGGGCPanK2-RGGAATTCTCACGGGATCTTCAACAGCTCAAGGpPanK2-FGGCTAGCACCATGAGGAGGCTCGGGCCCTTCiPanK2-F1GGCTAGCACCATGGATAGCCTCTCATTGGACiPanK2-F2GGGTACCTGATAGCCTCTCATTGGACsPanK2-FGGCTAGCACCaTGGGGGGCTTGCTCiPanK2-PmeI-FGTTTAAACAACATGGATAGCCTCTCATTGGACGGAGiPanK2-BlpI-2GCTCAGCATGATCACGGGATCTTCAACAGiPanK2-PstI-FCTGCAGATAGCCTCTCATTGGACGiPanK2-BstZ17I-R2GTATACGGGATCTTCAACAGCTCAAGG Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Plasmids used in this studyPlasmidMassDescriptionkDapKM330.8spPanK2 in pcDNA3.1(—)pKM462.7pPanK2 in pcDNA3.1(—)pKM557.6iPanK2 in pcDNA3.1(—)pKM761.2iPanK2 with N-terminal His tag in pcDNA3.1-HisApKM3150.6sPanK2 in pcDNA3.1(—)pKM5648.7mPanK2 with N-terminal His tag in pcDNA3.1-HisApPJ27357.6iPanK2 in pTandempKM6160.9C-terminal His-iPanK2(G521R) in pTandempKM6257.6/60.9Coexpression of iPanK2 plus C-terminal His-iPanK2(G521R) in pTandem Open table in a new tab Construction of the Plasmid for Coexpression of iPanK2 with iPanK2(G521R)—To test whether the PanK2(G521R) mutation had a dominant negative effect on PanK2, we constructed a plasmid to coexpress the wild-type and G521R forms of iPanK2 in tandem from a bicistronic mRNA. iPanK2-PmeI and iPanK2-BlpI-2 primers were used to introduce a PmeI and a BlpI restriction site by PCR at the beginning and end of the wild-type iPanK2 coding sequence, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO® (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Then the wild-type iPanK2 sequence was inserted into the pTandem-1 vector (Novagen) within the PmeI and BlpI sites, and the resulting plasmid was named pPJ273. iPanK2-PstI-F and iPanK2-BstZ17I-R2 primers were used to introduce a PstI and a BstZ17I restriction site into the iPanK2(G521R) sequence by PCR. The PCR product was cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO® and sequenced. The plasmid containing the correct mutant sequence was digested with PstI, treated with Klenow polymerase to generate blunt ends, and then digested with BstZ17I. The gel-purified mutant fragment was inserted into the pTandem-1 vector digested previously with PstI, treated with Klenow, and digested with BstZ17I to yield pKM61. The PmeI and BlpI double-digested wild-type fragment from pPJ273 was inserted into pKM61 giving rise to plasmid pKM62, which contained both the native wild-type and C-terminal His-tagged mutant sequences. Site-directed Mutagenesis of PanK2—Point mutations that occurred twice or more in PKAN patients were generated in plasmid pKM7 (iPanK2 in pcDNA3.1-HisA) using the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's procedure (Stratagene). Lys-224 was predicted to be important for ATP binding by sequence analysis and was mutated to alanine to serve as a catalytically inactive control. Gly-219 → Val was found in only one late onset patient but was also included in the mutagenesis because Gly-219 is part of the “DIGGS” motif of PanK proteins. The expression levels of the PanK2 mutants were determined by quantitative Western blots as described below, and their activities were normalized to the protein expression levels. Transfection of HEK 293T Cells and Preparation of Cell Lysates—The different forms of PanK2 protein were overexpressed in HEK 293T cells (from Suzanne Baker, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital), which were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals) following transfection with FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Roche Applied Science). Cells were collected 48 h after transfection, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 5 μg/ml of leupeptin). After incubation on ice for 1 h, cells were lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove the unbroken cells. The supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate. After incubation on ice for 1 h, the protein precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 30 min. The precipitated protein was resuspended in the lysis buffer without leupeptin and dialyzed against the same lysis buffer overnight at 4 °C. The dialyzed protein sample was stored in 50% glycerol at –20 °C. Western Blot Detection of PanK2 Proteins—A peptide, SKDNYKRVTGTSLGC, was synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by the Hartwell Center for Biotechnology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and was sent to Rockland Inc. (Gilbertsville, PA) for raising rabbit polyclonal antiserum that recognized PanK1, PanK2, and PanK3. Affinity purification of the polyclonal antibody was performed as described previously (8Rock C.O. Karim M.A. Zhang Y.-M. Jackowski S. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 291: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HEK 293T cells were transfected and lysed using hypotonic lysis buffer as described above. Aliquots of the crude cell lysate from transfected cells were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 10% NuPAGE® NOVEX bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). The separated proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the PanK2 proteins were detected by PanK-specific, affinity-purified antibody at a dilution of 1:500 (stock is 1.4 mg/ml), which was incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. The His-tagged wild-type and mutant iPanK2 proteins were detected with anti-His rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the primary antibody at a dilution of 1:500 (stock is 0.2 mg/ml). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody and was diluted to 1:5,000 prior to incubation with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed five times with 100 ml of TBS-T and developed using the ECF detection reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The fluorescent signal was detected using a Typhoon 9200 (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitatively analyzed with ImageQuant software, version 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences). Pantothenate Kinase Activity Assay—Briefly, the standard pantothenate kinase assays (8Rock C.O. Karim M.A. Zhang Y.-M. Jackowski S. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 291: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Rock C.O. Park H.-W. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3410-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) contained d-[1-14C]pantothenate (90 μm; specific activity 55 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), ATP (2.5 mm,pH 7.0), MgCl2 (10 mm), Tris-HCl (0.1 m, pH 7.5), and the indicated amount of protein from the cell extracts containing PanK2 in a total volume of 40 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 4 μl of 10% (v/v) acetic acid, and 40 μl of the mixture was then deposited onto a Whatman DE81 ion-exchange filter disk that was washed in three changes of 1% acetic acid in 95% ethanol (25 ml/disk) to remove unreacted pantothenate. 4′-Phosphopantothenate was quantified by counting each dried disk in 3 ml of scintillation fluid. Background counts from assays in the absence of PanK2 protein were subtracted from those obtained with PanK2 preparations. The effects of different CoA species on the enzymatic activity of PanK2 were determined by including the indicated concentrations of CoA species in the assay mix prior to the addition of PanK2 protein. The extracts from cells carrying the empty vector contained endogenous PanK activity at less that 0.2% of the level expressed by the wild-type protein. This same value was found with the iPanK2(K224A) mutant. The activities of the mutants were compared with the wild-type protein as follows. The protein concentrations in the dialyzed extracts were determined by the Bradford method (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Aliquots containing 2.5, 5, and 10 μg of protein were assayed for PanK activity as described above, and the apparent specific activity was calculated by regression analysis. These same three protein concentrations were also fractionated by SDS-gel electrophoresis, and the PanK2 proteins were detected by immunoblotting with the anti-PanK antibody as described above. The relative amount of each PanK mutant was determined by quantitation of the fluorescent signal obtained from the Typhoon 9200. The ECF method was employed for quantification because there is a linear relationship between the fluorescent signal and the amount of protein over a 25-fold dilution range. These values were normalized to the wild-type protein, which was given a value of 1, and the normalization factor was multiplied by the specific activity to obtain the normalized activity reported in the tables and figures. In the case where multiple PanK2 species were detected by immunoblotting, the signals from each band were added together. A wild-type protein expression control was used in all transfection experiments, which were performed at least twice, and the data were combined. Determination of the Oligomerization State of PanK2—The Stokes radius of PanK2 was evaluated by using gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex™ 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein molecular weight markers were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Because spPanK2 was not expressed in 293T cells, we used the TNT® Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) to express spPanK2 in vitro according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the 50-μl reaction mix contained 1 μg of pKM3 (template plasmid for spPanK2), 40 μl of TNT® Quick Master Mix, and 2 μl of l-[35S]methionine (1,000 Ci/mmol at 16.7 mCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences). After 90 min of incubation at 30 °C, 5 μl of the reaction mix was loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel to determine the expression level of spPanK2. The dried gel was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and the autoradiograph was scanned using a Typhoon 9200 (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with ImageQuant software, version 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences). The activity of the spPanK2 expressed in vitro was tested using 15 μlofthe reaction mix in the standard PanK assay as described above. Reactions using template plasmid for iPanK2 (pKM5), pcDNA3.1(–) vector and no template DNA were included as controls. Expression and Activity of Human PanK2 Isoforms—Four homologous human PANK genes have been identified in silico (1Zhou B. Westaway S.K. Levinson B. Johnson M.A. Gitschier J. Hayflick S.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), and multiple transcripts were thought to arise from the PANK2 gene (1Zhou B. Westaway S.K. Levinson B. Johnson M.A. Gitschier J. Hayflick S.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 10Kotzbauer P.T. Truax A.C. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.Y J.

The longest cDNA encodes a precursor protein, termed pPanK2, consisting of 570 residues (10Kotzbauer P.T. Truax A.C. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.Y J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The validity of the larger pPanK2 isoform being the primary transcript is supported by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA end results (11Hortnagel K. Prokisch H. Meitinger T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), PCR cloning from a Marathon cDNA library (10Kotzbauer P.T. Truax A.C. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.Y J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and the identification of an EST clone corresponding to the 5′ end of the transcript we used to assemble the cDNA. This protein is sequentially processed by peptidase(s) to yield a transient 57.6-kDa intermediate, termed iPanK2, and a long lived 48-kDa mature form, mPanK2 (Fig. 1A). The first cDNA that was isolated encoded a smaller 50.6-kDa isoform, termed sPanK2, that initiates at Leu-111 (1Zhou B. Westaway S.K. Levinson B. Johnson M.A. Gitschier J. Hayflick S.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), and subsequently a 288-amino acid splice variant, termed spPanK2, with a predicted size of 30.8 kDa was described that arises from a putative alternate initiation exon (11Hortnagel K. Prokisch H. Meitinger T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We cloned and expressed by transient transfection all of these PanK2 isoforms in 293T cells, and we determined their apparent molecular sizes by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with an antibody that recognizes a common element within the catalytic core domain (Fig. 1B). Both the pPanK2 and iPanK2 were expressed well and were partially converted to mPanK2. The sPanK2 expressed well but was not processed to the mPanK2 form (Fig. 1B). The expressed mPanK2 protein was not processed further (Fig. 1B). All of the PanK2 isoforms that were expressed in 293T cells were catalytically active (Fig. 1C). This was not a surprising result, because the catalytic core identified in all mammalian PanKs encompasses residues 211–570 (7Rock C.O. Calder R.B. Karim M.A. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1377-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8Rock C.O. Karim M.A. Zhang Y.-M. Jackowski S. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 291: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and all of the isoforms, except spPanK2, possess this identical central sequence. Furthermore, normalization of the expression levels using Western blotting and activity determinations over a range of protein concentrations showed that the overall activities of the different isoforms were nearly identical (Fig. 1C). The only exception was the sPanK2 species, which had a slightly lower specific activity in these experiments. Pantothenate kinase activity above base line was never detected in the spPanK2-transfected cell lysates, and neither were we able to detect the presence of immunoreactive protein (not shown). Therefore, we expressed the spPanK2 cDNA by using an in vitro coupled transcription/translation system. In this expression system, the amount of spPanK2 protein expressed was equal to or higher than the level of iPanK2 (Fig. 1D). Thus, we concluded that the reason the spPanK2 was not detected when expressed in 293T cells was because of rapid protein degradation. The transcription/translation products were then assayed for pantothenate kinase activity (Fig. 1E). Although the iPanK2 extract possessed pantothenate kinase activity, the spPanK2 extract did not. We concluded that spPanK2 cDNA does not encode a functional pantothenate kinase. This finding is consistent with the spPanK2 protein lacking the highly conserved DIGGT(S)XXK motif present in all eukaryotic PanK catalytic domains (Fig. 1A). The mutagenesis experiments described below demonstrate that this motif is essential for pantothenate kinase activity. Biochemical and Regulatory Properties of PanK2—A distinguishing feature of PanK2 is its extremely high sensitivity to feedback inhibition by CoA and its thioesters. The mPanK2 was potently inhibited by all four CoA species tested with IC50 values between 250 and 500 nm (Fig. 2A). These findings were in sharp contrast to the significantly weaker inhibition of the highly related PanK1β isoform by acetyl-CoA (IC50 = 10 μm) and the lack of inhibition of the PanK1β isoform by CoA and palmitoyl-CoA (9Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32594-32601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Another related isoform is PanK3, which exhibits differential sensitivity to the panel of CoA thioesters and is most potently inhibited by acetyl-CoA (IC50 = 1 μm) and the least inhibited by CoA (IC50 = 125 μm) (9Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32594-32601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The protein domain of PanK3 responsible for the higher affinity CoA thioester binding was identified as residues 56–104 (9Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32594-32601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the catalytic core region of PanK2 is related to residues 56–104 of PanK3 and was clearly distinct from the same region of PanK1. This stringent regulation of PanK2 explains why we were unable to detect PanK2 activity in 293T cell lysates unless they were first dialyzed to remo"
https://openalex.org/W2064540629,"Growth hormone (GH) plays an important role in growth and metabolism by signaling via at least three major pathways, including STATs, ERK1/2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt. Physiological concentrations of insulin promote growth probably by modulating liver GH receptor (GHR) levels in vivo, but the possible effects of insulin on GH-induced post-GHR signaling have yet to be studied. We hypothesized that short-term insulin, similar to the fluctuations that occur following feeding, affects GH-induced post-GHR signaling. Our present studies suggest that, in rat H4IIE hepatoma cells, insulin (4 h or less) selectively enhanced GH-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, but not GH-induced activation of STAT5 and Akt. Although insulin pretreatment altered GH-induced formation of Shc·Grb2·SOS complex, it did not significantly affect GH-induced activation of other signaling intermediates upstream of MEK/ERK, including JAK2, Ras, and Raf-1. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that insulin pretreatment facilitated GH-induced cell membrane translocation of MEK1/2. Insulin pretreatment also increased the amount of MEK association with its scaffolding protein, KSR. In summary, short-term insulin treatment of cultured, liver-derived cells selectively sensitized GH-induced MEK/ERK phosphorylation independent of JAK2, Ras, and Raf-1, but likely resulted from increased cell membrane translocation of MEK1/2. These findings suggest that insulin may be necessary for sensitization of cells to GH-induced ERK1/2 activation and provides a potential cellular mechanism by which insulin promotes growth.

By contrast, activation of ERK1/2 pathway is dependent on a 46-amino acid stretch of the GHR located adjacent to the cell membrane (11Sotiropoulos A. Perrot-Applanat M. Dinerstein H. Pallier A.

Activation of GHR/JAK2 results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, which then interacts with the adapter protein Grb2. Pre-associated with Grb2 is SOS, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which is recruited to the cell membrane via Shc·Grb2 association, stimulates formation of active GTP-bound Ras, which then initiates a sequence of phosphorylation events that activate a cascade of protein serine/threonine kinases. Ras activates Raf-1 kinase leading to phosphorylation and activation of MEK1/2, which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2. A JAK2-independent mechanism of ERK1/2 activation via Src-dependent activation of Ral and phospholipase D was also reported (18Zhu T. Ling L. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45592-45603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). GH-induced ERK1/2 activation can activate downstream gene expression and transcription factors, including c-Fos, Egr-1, Jun-B, and Elk-1 (5Hodge C. Liao J.F. Stofega M. Guan K.L. Cartersu C. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31327-31336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Responsiveness to GH can be regulated by other hormones, such as insulin. A previous report from our laboratory found that, in rat H4IIE hepatoma cells, prolonged insulin treatment (8–24 h) inhibits GH signaling via the GHR/JAK2/STAT5B pathway, probably by down-regulating GHR levels (19Ji S. Guan R. Frank S.J. Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13434-13442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This suggests that hepatic GH resistance may develop when a patient exhibits chronic hyperinsulinemia, a condition often observed in patients with obesity and in the early stage of Type 2 diabetes. However, physiological levels of insulin appear to be necessary for normal liver GH responsiveness, possibly by maintaining liver GHR levels (20Baxter R.C. Bryson J.M. Turtle J.R. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1176-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 21Bereket A. Lang C.H. Blethen S.L. Gelato M.C. Fan J. Frost R.A. Wilson T.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Endocrinol. 1994; 142: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition to the role of insulin in maintaining liver GHR levels, insulin may also affect GH-induced post-receptor signaling. In the present study, we investigated the effects of short-term insulin pretreatment, to mimic the fluctuations that occur following feeding, on GH signaling in cultured rat H4IIE hepatoma cells. We found that insulin selectively enhanced GH-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, but not GH-stimulated phosphorylation/activation of STAT5 or Akt. ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by GH, alone or following insulin pretreatment, required MEK1/2 activation. Insulin pretreatment increased GH-induced Shc·Grb2 association and accelerated GH-induced Grb2·SOS dissociation, leading to increased SOS dissociation from Shc and Grb2. GH-induced activation of other signaling intermediates located upstream of MEK1/2, such as JAK2, Ras, and Raf-1, was not significantly changed following insulin pretreatment. However, there was an increase in GH-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 following insulin pretreatment, which correlated with increased cell membrane translocation of MEK1/2. Furthermore, insulin increased the association of MEK and its scaffolding protein, kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), and GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KSR. In summary, short-term insulin treatment of cultured, liver-derived cells, selectively sensitized GH-induced MEK/ERK phosphorylation, most likely by facilitating the formation of a MEK·KSR complex and subsequent cell membrane translocation of MEK1/2. These findings suggest that insulin may sensitize liver GH-induced signaling via the MEK/ERK pathway and provide a potential mechanism by which insulin promotes growth.

At ∼50% confluence, cells were removed from serum and maintained in serum-free (and bovine serum albumin-free) medium for 48 h prior to the start of experimental treatments. PD 98059 was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and LY 294002 was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Protein Extraction—Cells were collected in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell lysates were gently rocked at 4 °C for 1 h, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were stored at -80 °C until use. Cell lysate protein concentrations were measured by Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of protein in lysis buffer was incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose (fast flow, Amersham Biosciences) was then added, and incubations were continued for 4 h at 4 °C. Both immunoprecipitated proteins or whole cell lysate protein (50 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad MiniProtean II System) and transferred to Schleicher & Schuell Protran BA85 membranes. The Western transfers were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween (TBST) and 5% milk, rinsed in TBST, and incubated 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody, washed in TBST, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled conventional secondary antibody or TrueBlot™ for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized by ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) or SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate reagents (Pierce) and autoradiography. Determination of GTP-bound Ras—According to the manufacturer's instructions, cells were lysed with magnesium-containing lysis buffer (MLB) containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10% glycerol, and 25 mm NaF. 10 μg of Raf-1 Ras-binding domain-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was added to 1 mg of cell lysate and gently rocked at 4 °C for 30 min. The agarose beads were washed three times with MLB and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min, the supernatant was then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Protran BA85 membrane. GTP-bound Ras was determined by immunoblotting with total Ras antibody. Raf-1 Kinase Assay—Raf-1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of cell lysate with mouse Raf-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase assay buffer with 1.5 mm MgCl2 and 7.5 μm ATP along with 0.4 μg of GST-MEK1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and the reaction was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The kinase reaction was terminated by adding 40 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Protran BA85 membrane. Raf-1 activity was evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-MEK1/2 antibody (BIOSOURCE International, Inc.). Immunofluorescence—Serum-starved cells were treated with various stimuli and then washed with PBS and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 45 min. The cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Thereafter, the cells were incubated with rabbit anti-MEK1/2 antibody (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h. Cells were mounted in VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and analyzed by confocal microscopy using a Leica DMIRBE Inverted SP1 confocal microscope (Bannockburn, IL) with a 100× oil immersion objective. Densitometric and Statistical Analysis—Chemiluminescent images of immunoblots were analyzed by scanning densitometry. Multiple exposures of each blot were used to obtain gray-scale images of each chemiluminescent band and were quantified with the Fluorchem FC imager system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). All data were analyzed by analysis of variance using the InStat statistical program (version 3) by GraphPad Software, Inc. (San Diego, CA), with * or # = p < 0.05, ** or ## = p < 0.01, and *** or ### = p < 0.001, upon comparison to the corresponding control group. Insulin Pretreatment Selectively Enhanced GH-induced ERK1/2 Phosphorylation in Rat H4IIE Hepatoma Cells—In rat H4IIE hepatoma cells, GH significantly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 by 5 min, reached a peak by 10–20 min, and returned to basal levels after 60 min (Fig. 1A, row 1, lanes 1–6). GH also induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (P-ERK1/2) by 5 min, with a maximal 8-fold induction by 10 min, and returned toward basal levels after 20 min (Fig. 1, A (rows 3 and 4, lanes 1–6), B, and C). Insulin-induced P-ERK1/2 peaked by 5 min, quickly decreased after 5 min and returning toward basal levels between 60 and 120 min (Fig. 1, B and C). Following insulin pretreatment for 120 min, P-ERK1/2 induced by GH 10 min was 30- to 40-fold, approximately equal to the maximal effect of insulin alone for 5 min. This induction of P-ERK1/2 was much greater than the sum of induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation by GH alone for 10 min plus the induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation by insulin alone at 120 min, indicating much more than a simple additivity of effects (Fig. 1, A (rows 3–4 and lanes 7–12) and B). To determine whether insulin pretreatment would affect the other two signaling pathways activated by GH, GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 (PY-STAT5) and serine phosphorylation of Akt (PS-Akt) were also characterized. The magnitude of GH-induced PY-STAT5 was not significantly altered by insulin pretreatment (Fig. 1A, row 1, compare lanes 1–5 to lanes 8–12). Induction of PS-Akt by GH was much weaker than by insulin and, due to the short exposure time, the PS-Akt induced by GH alone was difficult to observe (Fig. 1A, row 2 and lanes 1–6). However, with longer autoradiography exposure, the GH effect on PS-Akt is clearly evident (data not shown) (26Ji S. Frank S.J. Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28384-28393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After insulin pretreatment for 120 min, phosphorylation of Akt (PS-Akt) was still highly elevated (Fig. 1A, row 2), and there was little effect of GH on top of this elevated PS-Akt. Therefore, the enhanced activation of GH-induced signaling following insulin pretreatment was selective to the ERK1/2 pathway and was not observed for GH-induced activation of STAT5 or Akt. Similar to insulin pretreatment for 120 min (Fig. 1, A and B), pretreatment with insulin for 30, 60, and 240 min also significantly enhanced GH-induced P-ERK1/2 (Fig. 1C). In the following experiments, to investigate the mechanism by which insulin enhanced GH-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, we chose insulin pretreatment for 120 min. After insulin pretreatment for 120 min, insulin-induced P-ERK1/2 had returned almost to basal levels (not true following 30–60 min of insulin pretreatment) and the enhanced GH-induced P-ERK1/2 by insulin 120 min was greater than or equal to insulin pretreatment for 240 min (Fig. 1, B and C). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 Induced by Insulin and GH, Alone or Combined, Depended on MEK1/2 Activation—Two major cellular signaling pathways activated by insulin are the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways (27Maassen J.A. Ouwens D.M. Front. Horm. Res. 1997; 22: 201-221Crossref Google Scholar). Activation of PI3K is required for ERK1/2 activation by GH in 3T3F442A cells, and GH-induced ERK1/2 activation is significantly augmented in insulin receptor substrate-1-expressing 32D-rGHR cells (6Liang L. Jiang J. Frank S.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3328-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Kilgour E. Gout I. Anderson N.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This suggests that the insulin receptor substrate-1/PI3K pathway may play an important role in GH signaling to ERK1/2. In H4IIE cells, PI3K signaling was not a major pathway activated by GH (Fig. 1A, row 2), but it could be significantly activated by insulin and remained activated at all insulin pretreatment time points used in the present studies. Thus, it was possible that insulin induction of PI3K was necessary for the enhanced GH-induced ERK1/2 activation following insulin pretreatment. To investigate the pathways involved in the enhanced GH-induced ERK1/2 activation following insulin pretreatment, H4IIE cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor (PD 98059) or the PI3K inhibitor (LY 294002) before insulin pretreatment. The MEK inhibitor (PD 98059) blocked P-ERK1/2 induced by GH and insulin, alone or combined (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that MEK1/2 activation is an absolute requirement for GH- and insulin-induced activation of ERK1/2. However, the PI3K inhibitor (LY 294002) did not significantly block the effect of GH alone to induce P-ERK1/2. Most important for the present studies, the addition of LY 294002 did not alter the effect of insulin to greatly augment GH-induced P-ERK1/2 levels (Fig. 2, A and B). This implies that PI3K does not play a major role in the enhancement of GH-induced P-ERK1/2 following insulin pretreatment. Insulin Did Not Alter GH-induced Tyrosine Phosphorylation of JAK2—Following GH binding to GHR, JAK2 is phosphorylated and transphosphorylates GHR. To investigate the mechanisms by which insulin enhanced GH-induced ERK1/2 signaling, we first characterized the effects of insulin on GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 (PY-JAK2). In H4IIE cells, GH significantly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 by 5 min, reached a peak by 10–20 min (3-fold), and returned to basal levels by 60 min or later (Fig. 3, A and B). It has been reported that insulin can directly activate JAK2 in some cell types (29Chen J. Sadowski H.B. Kohanski R.A. Wang L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 30Sawka-Verhelle D. Filloux C. Tartare-Deckert S. Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but insulin did not induce PY-JAK2 in H4IIE cells (Fig. 3A and data not shown). After insulin pretreatment, there was no significant change in GH-induced PY-JAK2 (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that insulin may affect GH signaling either independent from or downstream of JAK2 activation. GH, Alone or Combined with Insulin, Did Not Induce an Interaction between Insulin and GH Receptors in H4IIE Cells—We recently reported that GH induces association of GHR and the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor (IGF-1R) in murine 3T3-F442A preadipocytes, and GH and IGF-1 synergize in signaling via STAT5 and ERK1/2 pathways (31Huang Y. Kim S.O. Yang N. Jiang J. Frank S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1471-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Insulin pretreatment did not affect GH activation of JAK2 (Fig. 3), but it is possible that GH might utilize the insulin receptor (IR) to enhance its activation of intracellular signaling, similar to the use of the IGF-1R, and due to the high level of similarity between insulin and IGF-1 receptors. As a control for the techniques used, we were able to find, as previously reported (31Huang Y. Kim S.O. Yang N. Jiang J. Frank S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1471-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), that treatment of 3T3-F442A cells with GH resulted in the appearance of a diffuse tyrosine phosphorylation of roughly 100–120 kDa in the anti-IGF-1R precipitate (Fig. 4, rows 1 and 2 and lane 2 versus 1), which is the GHR. GH did not induce association of phosphorylated GHR and IR in 3T3-F442A cells (Fig. 4, rows 1 and 2, lanes 3 and 4 versus 2), possibly due to the low abundance of the IR protein in these cells (Fig. 4, row 3, lanes 3 and 4). In rat H4IIE hepatoma cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of IR was strongly induced by insulin at 5 min and still remained highly elevated at 120 min (Fig. 4, rows 1 and 2, lanes 6 and 8 versus 5). GH did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of IR, alone, or following insulin 120 min (Fig. 4, rows 1 and 2, lanes 7 and 9 versus 5). No GHR was co-immunoprecipitated with IR in response to GH, alone or following insulin pretreatment (Fig. 4, rows 1 and 2, lanes 5–9). IR was not detected in the immunoprecipitates with anti-GHR antibody under these conditions in H4IIE cells (data not shown), further suggesting a lack of interaction between insulin and GH receptors in the H4IIE cells used in the present study. Effects of Insulin on GH-induced Formation of the Shc·Grb2·SOS Complex—When activated, both JAK2 and the IR can phosphorylate Shc. Activated Shc recruits Grb2·SOS, bringing SOS to the cell membrane, resulting in activation of the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway (32Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Unlike the phylogenetically disperse adenosine (A) to inosine (I) editing, cytosine (C) to uridine (U) editing has only been previously described in organellar tRNAs. We have shown that cytoplasmic tRNAThr(AGU) undergoes two distinct editing events in the anticodon loop: C to U and A to I. In vivo, every inosine-containing tRNAThr is also C to U edited at position 32. In vitro, C to U editing stimulates conversion of A to I at the wobble base. Although the in vivo and in vitro requirements differ, in both cases, the C to U change plays a key role in A to I editing. Due to an unusual abundance of A34-containing tRNAs, our results also suggest that the unedited and edited tRNAs are functional, each dedicated to decoding a specific threonine codon. C to U editing of cytoplasmic tRNA expands the editing repertoire in eukaryotic cells, and when coupled to A to I changes, leads to an interrelation between editing sites.

The degeneracy of the genetic code is implied in the need for 61 sense codons to specify 20 different amino acids and, with the exception of methionine and tryptophan, each amino acid is encoded by more than one codon (1Agris P.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This discrepancy between codon and amino acid numbers was first explained by Crick's wobble hypothesis, which invoked flexibility between the first anticodon and third codon positions during decoding (2Crick F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 19: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Since the inception of the wobble rules, over 100 posttranscriptional modifications have been described with the largest number affecting the anticodon of tRNA (3Agris P.F. Malkiewicz A. Guenther R. Basti M. Sengupta R. Stuart J. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1995; : 254-255PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sprinzl M. Vassilenko K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D139-D140Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). As anticodon modifications accrue, new findings lead to a constant reinterpretation of the wobble rules to include novel effects on tRNA function. Although some anticodon modifications play key roles in translational fidelity and efficiency (1Agris P.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 5Esberg B. Bjork G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1967-1975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), anticodon-sequence alterations that permit decoding of multiple codons are part of a growing number of posttranscriptional changes collectively known as tRNA editing. Thus decoding changes imparted by tRNA editing provide a mechanism to effectively accommodate genetic code degeneracy. To date, well characterized anticodon editing events include editing of C34 to lysidine of methionyl tRNAs in bacteria, which permits decoding of AUA codons as isoleucine (6Soma A. Ikeuchi Y.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 149: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), its involvement in codon alterations in eukaryotes was first demonstrated by the discovery of A to I editing in mRNAs (12Bass B.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1988; 55: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 13Wagner R.W. Smith J.E. Cooperman B.S. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2647-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Inosine in mRNA expands the number of proteins that can be encoded from a single gene and is a significant source of genetic diversity (14Gott J.M. Emeson R.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 499-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In tRNA, adenosines at the first position of the anticodon (A34, wobble position) are almost universally changed to inosine by hydrolytic deamination of the 6-amino group of the base (4Sprinzl M. Vassilenko K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D139-D140Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 15Auxilien S. Crain P.F. Trewyn R.W. Grosjean H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 437-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This editing reaction is so efficient that under steady-state conditions, A34-containing tRNAs are difficult to detect, tRNAThr from Mycoplasma, thus far, being the only naturally occurring exception (16Andachi Y. Yamao F. Iwami M. Muto A. Osawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7398-7402Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). C to U editing of tRNA is less prevalent and, until now, restricted to eukaryotic organelles. In marsupial mitochondria, a single C to U editing event at the second position of the anticodon (C35) changes a tRNA such that it recognizes aspartate in place of glycine codons (9Borner G.V. Morl M. Janke A. Paabo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5949-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Janke A. Paabo S.

Some evidence supports the requirement for methylation and pseudouridylation reactions prior to editing (19Morl M. Dorner M. Paabo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3380-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). C to U editing in this system is also required for creating the proper substrate for further modification of the first anticodon position (G34) (19Morl M. Dorner M. Paabo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3380-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This C to U editing also generates structural features important for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase recognition (9Borner G.V. Morl M. Janke A. Paabo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5949-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The only other example of C to U editing of tRNA occurs in the mitochondria of trypanosomatids (8Alfonzo J.D. Blanc V. Estevez A.M. Rubio M.A. Simpson L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7056-7062Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), where the nucleus-encoded tryptophanyl tRNA (tRNATrp) is transcribed with a CCA anticodon. A subpopulation of this tRNA is imported into the mitochondrion, where RNA editing of C34 creates the U34CA anticodon required to translate the UGA tryptophan codons found in mitochondrial mRNAs. Following mitochondrial import, tRNATrp undergoes an unprecedented number of posttranscriptional modifications, which, as in the marsupial system, may play a role in editing specificity (8Alfonzo J.D. Blanc V. Estevez A.M. Rubio M.A. Simpson L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7056-7062Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Simpson L. Thiemann O.H. Savill N.J. Alfonzo J.D. Maslov D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6986-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have shown that the cytoplasmic tRNAThr-(AGU) of Trypanosoma brucei undergoes two distinct editing events in the anticodon loop, where A34 is changed to inosine and C32 is changed to uridine. We demonstrated that C to U editing at position 32 affects the efficiency of A to I editing of the anticodon. These findings represented the first example of C to U editing of tRNAs outside organelles and demonstrated an interrelation between two different editing sites in a single anticodon loop. Unlike most organisms, we also reported an abundance of unedited tRNAs, which are substrates for aminoacylation in vivo. Together, our findings have raised new and important questions about the prevalence of tRNA editing in eukaryotes and demonstrated a functional role for double editing of tRNAs in trypanosomatids. Cell Culture and Preparation of Cell-free Extracts—T. brucei cells were grown in SDM-79 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Fisher) and 10 g/ml hemin (Calbiochem). Exponentially growing cultures (2 × 106 cells/ml) were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The resulting pellets were suspended in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. 3The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolRTreverse transcriptase. The suspension was sonicated with a Sonifier 450 sonicator (Branson) using a microprobe at 50% output for a total of five intervals with 1-min rest between sonication. The resulting lysate was initially spun at 10,000 rpm in a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-25 centrifuge JA25.50 rotor for 15 min at 4 °C followed by a 30-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a Beckman Coulter Optima L-90K ultracentrifuge Type 60TI rotor at 4 °C. To the clarified lysate, glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20% and stored frozen in 4 mg/ml aliquots at –80 °C. dithiothreitol reverse transcriptase. cDNA Synthesis and Amplification by PCR—RNA was isolated from cells (total RNA) and/or nuclear fractions by the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and as described previously by us (22Kapushoc S.T. Alfonzo J.D. Rubio M.A. Simpson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37907-37914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). RNA was further treated with RQ1 (RNA qualified) RNase-free DNase I (Promega). Two picomoles of reverse oligonucleotide primer (57R: 5′-AGGCCACTGGGGGGATCGAACCC-3′) complementary to the 3′-end of tRNAThr(AGU) was added to 5 μg of total or nuclear RNA with 10 μmol of all four deoxynucleotide triphosphates and heated at 65 °C for 5 min and then quick-cooled at 4 °C for 1 min followed by the addition of 1 μl of SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase-(RT) in 1× first strand buffer and incubation at 50 °C, as described (Invitrogen). Following the RT reaction, the cDNA was amplified from 2 μl of the 20-μl RT reaction as a template in a 100-μl (PCR) with 40 pmol of forward (56F: 5′-GGCCGCTTAGCTCAATGGCAGAG-3′) and 40 pmol of reverse (57R) oligonucleotide primers. PCR reactions were performed using Taq DNA polymerase and incubated in a thermal cycler using a program consisting of a 94 °C denaturation step, a 50 °C annealing step for 40 s, and an elongation step of 72 °C repeated for a total of 20 cycles, following manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Controls included a mock reaction in which the RT was left out of the reaction and used as a negative control to test for DNA contamination in the RNA samples and a reaction in which total genomic DNA was used as a template serving as a positive control for amplification. RT-PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). Independent clones were isolated after transformation of DH5α Escherichia coli and sequenced using Sequenase™ Version 2.0 DNA polymerase (USB), per the manufacturer's instructions. The dideoxynucleotide terminated sequencing reactions were separated in a 6% acrylanmide/7 m urea denaturing gel, and the resulting sequences were used to ascertain the state of editing for each clone. In Vitro Editing Assays—In vitro transcribed tRNAs with internally incorporated [α-32P]ATP were heated in water at 70 °C for 3 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. After 1 min, reaction buffer was added to a final concentration of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol), and the mixture was allowed to cool for an additional 5 min. The reaction was started by the addition of cell extract and incubated at 27 °C. For the time course experiments, a large reaction (446 μl) containing 40 pmol of RNA (200,000 cpm) in reaction buffer was assembled. As a negative control, an aliquot of 49 μl was transferred into a separate tube and incubated at 27 °C for 480 min. To the remaining 397-μl reaction mix, 8.1 μl of cell extract was added and incubated at 27 °C. Eight individual aliquots of 50 μl were removed after 1, 30, 50, 120, 180, 240, 360, and 480 min, respectively). Each sample was extracted using an equal volume of phenol (previously saturated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). The RNA in the aqueous phase was recovered after precipitation with a 0.1 volume equivalent of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 2.5 volumes of ethanol and incubated at –20 °C. After centrifugation, the resulting pellet was dissolved in 30 mm ammonium acetate and 10 mm zinc acetate containing 0.4 units nuclease P1 in a 20-μl reaction (MPBiomedicals). The digestion reaction was incubated at 37 °C for at least 12 h. The reaction was dried down in a SpeedVac DNA 110 concentrator system (Savant) for 10 min under high heat. The dried sample was resuspended in 3 μl of double distilled H2O, where 1 μl (13.33 pmol) was spotted and dried individually onto a cellulose TLC sheet (EMD Chemicals). On the same sheet, 2.5 pmol of a cold mix containing adenosine 5′-monophosphate and inosine 5′-monophosphate was spotted in a separate lane and used as cold markers. The TLC was allowed to develop using liquid chromatography in Solvent C (0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 6.8):ammonium sulfate:n-propyl alcohol (100:60:2, v/w/v). The TLC plate was allowed to dry and was then exposed to a PhosphorImager™ screen. The resulting images were visualized and quantified using an Amersham Biosciences Storm® imaging system with an ImageQuant® program (Amersham Biosciences). Cold markers were visualized by a hand-held ultraviolet lamp at 260 nm and used to assess the relative migration of the 32P-labeled individual nucleoside 5′-monophosphates from the radiolabeled samples. Two-dimensional TLC was used to further confirm the relative positions of nucleoside 5′-monophosphates assignments. The first dimension of the TLC plate was developed in Solvent A (isobutyric acid:25% ammonium hydroxide:H2O; 50:1.1:28.9, v/v/v). The TLC plate was removed and allowed to dry before separation in the second dimension by developing in Solvent B (isopropyl alcohol:concentrated HCl: water, 68:18:14, v/v/v) or solvent C (0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 6.8): ammonium sulfate:n-propyl alcohol, 100:60:2, v/w/v). Nucleotide assignments were made using published maps (23Grosjean H. Keith G. Droogmans L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 265: 357-391PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Aminoacylation and Oxidation Assays—To corroborate the editing state of aminoacylated species, total aminoacyl-tRNAs were extracted under acidic conditions (using phenol equilibrated with 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and 10 mm EDTA), ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and 1 mm EDTA. The RNA was then split into two fractions. One fraction was deacylated by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h in a basic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 9.0) followed by oxidation of the 3′-ribose by treatment with 40 mm NaIPO4 in ice for 90 min. The second fraction was directly oxidated by NaIPO4 followed by deacylation as above. Both fractions were individually polyadenylated by incubation of the RNA at 37 °C for 45 min in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.7 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 500 μm ATP and 1,700 units of yeast poly-A polymerase in 100 μl of reaction buffer. The reaction was then supplemented with 30 μl of 5× E. coli poly-A buffer (200 mm Tris, 7.0, 1 m NaCl, and 25 mm MgCl2), 15 μl of 5 mm ATP, 1 μlof 0.1 m DTT, 3.5 μl of Mn Cl2, and 3 units of E. coli poly-A polymerase and incubated further for 45 min at 37 °C. The reactions were phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. Both reactions were then used in RT-PCR reactions. First, a 3′-primer specific for the poly-A tail was used to RT-PCR the poly-adenylated RNA followed by PCR with the RT primer and a 5′-specific primer specific for tRNAThr(AGU) in a 100-μl PCR reaction as above. One μl of this reaction was used as a template for a second PCR reaction in which both primers were specific for tRNAThr-(AGU). The resulting product was purified, cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), and transformed into E. coli, and individual clones were sequenced to establish editing levels. For in vitro aminoacylation, all assays were performed at 37 °C as follows. A 35-μl pre-reaction mixture was first prepared containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 5 mm DTT, 15 μm in vitro transcribed tRNAThr variants (see “Results” for details), and 28 μm l-[3-3H]threonine. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl (1 μg/μl total protein) of T. brucei extract. Eight-μl aliquots were removed periodically and spotted onto 3MM filter disks presoaked in 5% trichloroacetic acid (w/v), washed three times in 5% trichloroacetic acid (w/v), rinsed in ethanol, and dried, and the remaining radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. In the search for examples of interdependence between different editing sites, we have focused on the formation of inosine at the wobble base (position 34) of tRNAs in T. brucei. In these organisms, eight different tRNA species contain an encoded A at the first position of the anticodon (A34). These tRNAs are proposed to undergo A to I editing to allow the decoding of the C-ending codons for the amino acids Ile, Ala, Leu, Pro, Val, Ser, Arg, and Thr (see Supplementary Fig. 1). We decided to determine the A to I editing levels of threonyl tRNA. The genome of T. brucei encodes three different tRNAThr genes with anticodons UGU, CGU, and AGU responsible for decoding ACA, ACG, and ACU codons, respectively. As in most organisms, trypanosomatids use a fourth threonine codon (ACC), which presumably cannot be decoded by tRNAThr(AGU), because A34 cannot efficiently wobble with C at the third codon position (Fig. 1A). To permit wobbling, this tRNA must undergo an A to I editing at position 34, where inosine (a guanosine analog) can then pair with the third position C (Fig. 1). To determine the levels of A to I editing in vivo, we designed oligonucleotide primers specific for tRNAThr(AGU) (Fig. 1B), where a 3′-specific oligomer was used to reverse-transcribe tRNAThr from total T. brucei RNA. The resulting cDNA was then used as a template for PCR amplification with the same 3′-primer and a 5′-specific oligomer. A specific amplification product was obtained with this set of primers when the reaction was performed in the presence of reverse transcriptase (Fig. 2A) but was absent in a mock control in which the enzyme was omitted from the reaction. A product of identical size was obtained when both primers were used to amplify tRNAThr from total genomic DNA used as a positive control for amplification (Fig. 2A). Both the cDNA-derived and the genomic DNA-derived products were then cloned into a plasmid vector and transformed into E. coli, and 30 independent clones were sequenced to assess the levels of A to I editing. As expected, we found that A34 is posttranscriptionally changed to I34 (G34 in the DNA sequence), where 18 out of 30 clones (60%) contained a G at position 34 (corresponding to inosine in the RNA sequence) (Fig. 2, B and C). These sequences also showed a second editing event at position 32 of the same tRNA. Position 32 is a genomically encoded cytidine, which as shown here is posttranscriptionally changed to uridine (Fig. 2B). In fact, under the conditions described, all of the inosine-containing tRNAs also have the C to U change (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate the first example of two different editing events in a single tRNA in any organism. A similar type of editing, but at much lower levels, was also observed with L. tarentolae, a slose relative of T. brucei.FIGURE 2tRNAThr(AGU) undergoes two different editing events in the same anticodon loop.

First, we tested for A to I editing in vitro.A 32P-labeled tRNAThr(AGU) was generated by in vitro transcription whereby every adenosine is radioactively labeled. This substrate was then incubated for various times with total cell-free extracts from T. brucei. Following this incubation, the labeled tRNA was gel-purified followed by digestion with nuclease P1. The nucleotide mixture generated by the nuclease treatment was then separated by TLC as described previously (8Alfonzo J.D. Blanc V. Estevez A.M. Rubio M.A. Simpson L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7056-7062Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Unlabeled adenosine and inosine were used as cold markers during the TLC separation. These markers, when visualized by UV shadowing, serve to corroborate the position of labeled adenosine and inosine generated during the assay. We found that >50% of adenosine 34 was efficiently converted to inosine by the T. brucei extract under the assay conditions described (Figs. 3A and 6C, and data not shown). No detectable inosine was observed in a control reaction using a substrate in which A34 was changed to G34, indicating that the observed A to I conversion is specific for position 34 (Fig. 3B). A two-dimensional-TLC was also performed to confirm the identity of the reaction products (Fig. 4).FIGURE 6The presence of U32 stimulates A to I conversion at the wobble base.

Grosjean H. Topics in Current Genetics. 12. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2005: 71-86Google Scholar). We have now expanded this model to include cytoplasmic tRNAs in these organisms. We propose that double editing of tRNAThr occurs in a sequential manner, where editing at one position affects subsequent editing at a second position (Fig. 5). To test a possible connection between the two sites, we created in vitro transcribed tRNA substrates representing the unedited tRNA and a possible intermediate in the editing reaction (Fig. 5, I and II) so that every adenosine in the various tRNAs is radioactively labeled. Upon incubation of the different substrates with cell-free extracts, we found that the C32-containing substrate could support editing; however, a similar substrate in which C32 was replaced by U32 (Fig. 5, II) supported editing with reproducibly higher efficiency and significantly higher initial rate (compare Fig. 3A and Fig. 6, A and C). We also found that tRNA substrates, in which C32 was replaced by A or G, showed no stimulation (data not shown). Taken together, the in vivo observation that every inosine-containing tRNAThr is also edited at position 32 and the observed in vitro stimulation of inosine formation led us to conclude that editing at one site affects editing at a second site and that indeed, the two editing events are interrelated. In our model, editing at position 32 occurs first, and it promotes efficient A to I editing at position 34 of the anticodon. If C to U editing at position 32 occurs first, this may impart subtle changes in the loop structure, providing the proper substrate for further editing at position 34 (Fig. 5, I). In this scheme, C to U editing may also affect tRNA aminoacylation in addition to modulating the ability of the tRNA to undergo further A to I editing. Alternatively, C to U editing may affect translational efficiency by affecting A to I formation, thus regulating wobbling. Recent evidence supports a role for I34 as a key determinant for synthetase recognition of tRNAIle in yeast (25Senger B. Auxilien S. Englisch U. Cramer F. Fasiolo F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8269-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that A to I editing affects charging of tRNAThr, substrates were generated corresponding to the two partially edited intermediates (Fig. 5, I and II) and incubated with partially purified synthetase fractions from T. brucei in the presence of 3H-labeled threonine. We found no significant difference in aminoacylation efficiency when the in vitro transcripts were compared with native tRNA (see Supplementary Fig. 2). However, in vitro, the presence of C32, in the A34-containing tRNA (the unedited tRNA), supported a reproducible 2-fold difference in amino acylation when compared with a similar substrate with a U at position 32. Interestingly, similar experiments performed with either substrate but with a G at position 34 supported similar charging efficiencies as the unedited tRNA (Fig. 7). The observed in vitro aminoacylation efficiency rules out the possibility that the differences in editing levels in vitro between the various substrates could be due to problems in the global folding of the in vitro transcribed tRNA substrates when compared with native substrates. To further assess the editing state of the aminoacylated tRNAs in vivo, we designed a coupled oxidation/polyadenylation assay. In this assay, RNA fractions were isolated under acidic conditions and then subjected to a combination of in vitro oxidation, polyadenylation, and RT-PCR (see “Materials and Methods”). In these reactions, oxidation by sodium periodate led to formation of a dialdehyde at the 3′-end of uncharged tRNAs, whereas the 3′-end of aminoacylated tRNAs is protected from oxidation by the covalently attached amino acid. The oxidized tRNA is not a substrate for polyadenylation, whereas following deacylation, only the charged tRNA will have an intact 3′-end and will thus serve as a substrate for poly-A polymerase (Fig. 8A). Under these conditions, we observed an RT-PCR product when total RNA was oxidized as described, whereas no product was detected in a similar reaction, where the total RNA was deacylated prior to oxidation to de-protect every tRNA present in the mixture (Fig. 8B). The product from the reaction above was then purified, cloned, and sequenced. We found that, as in the in vitro situation, both the edited and the unedited tRNA were substrates for aminoacylation, where the majority of the charged species (23 out of 30 clones) corresponded to that of the double-edited tRNA (Fig. 8C). We previously proposed an interdependence model for editing and modification in tRNA (24Rubio M.A.T Alfonzo J.D. Grosjean H. Topics in Current Genetics. 12. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2005: 71-86Google Scholar). This model suggests that editing and modifications at multiple sites act in concert to help achieve the degree of substrate specificity that different systems demand. To further expand this model, we have focused on the process of inosine formation in the tRNAs of trypanosomatids. Here we have described the first example of two different editing events in a single tRNA anticodon loop, whereby positions 32 and 34 of tRNAThr undergo C to U and A to I editing, respectively. The finding that every inosine-containing tRNA also undergoes C to U editing at position 32 (5′ of the wobble position) raised important questions as to what role the two editing events play in the function of this tRNA. In vivo, every I34-containing tRNAThr(AGU) also has the C to U change at position 32. By establishing an A to I editing assay, we have demonstrated that C to U stimulates A to I editing in vitro, indicating interdependence between the two editing sites. The fact that the C32-containing in vitro transcribed tRNA (devoid of naturally occurring posttranscriptional modifications) can still be edited in vitro raises the possibility that in addition to C to U editing, other factors in vivo (e.g. posttranscriptional modifications) make the requirements for double editing stricter. The observed interdependence also suggested that these cells might be able to regulate A to I editing of tRNAThr through changes in C to U editing activity. A to I editing is conserved in many organisms and occurs by hydrolytic deamination of adenosine (26Grosjean H. Auxilien S. Constantinesco F. Simon C. Corda Y. Becker H.F. Foiret D. Morin A. Jin Y.X. Fournier M. Fourrey J.L. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 488-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In yeast, the enzyme involved has two subunits, resembling cytidine deaminases, that upon association specifically deaminates A34 to generate I34 and requires an intact tRNA structure for activity (26Grosjean H. Auxilien S. Constantinesco F. Simon C. Corda Y. Becker H.F. Foiret D. Morin A. Jin Y.X. Fournier M. Fourrey J.L. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 488-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). E. coli contains a homolog of the smaller, but not the larger, subunit of the yeast enzyme (28Wolf J. Gerber A.P. Keller W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3841-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The E. coli enzyme catalyzes the same A to I editing but, unlike the yeast enzyme, deaminates much smaller substrates, including molecules that are essentially short versions of the anticodon stem-loop (27Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 28Wolf J. Gerber A.P. Keller W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3841-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 29Grosjean H. Edqvist J. Straby K.B. Giege R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 67-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The E. coli enzyme, however, is very specific in that it is able to deaminate the cognate bacterial tRNAArg but is unable to edit any of the eukaryotic A34-containing tRNAs (26Grosjean H. Auxilien S. Constantinesco F. Simon C. Corda Y. Becker H.F. Foiret D. Morin A. Jin Y.X. Fournier M. Fourrey J.L. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 488-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Wolf J. Gerber A.P. Keller W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3841-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although the enzyme that performs A to I editing in trypanosomatids has not been identified, it is likely that this enzyme also utilizes a similar mechanism to that described for yeast and E. coli. The mechanism of C to U editing at position 32 is less clear. To date, a C to U tRNA editing enzyme has not been identified in any organism. However, C to U editing via a deamination mechanism plays a key role in the processing of the apoB mRNA in mammalian cells (30Driscoll D.M. Wynne J.K. Wallis S.C. Scott J. Cell. 1989; 58: 519-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 31Tennyson G.E. Sabatos C.A. Eggerman T.L. Brewer Jr., H.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32Teng B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Given this precedent, it is possible that the tRNA C to U editing enzyme also utilizes a deamination mechanism. Furthermore, in the case of ribose methylation, one enzyme, TRM7, is responsible for the methylation of both positions 32 and 34 in yeast tRNAs (33Pintard L. Lecointe F. Bujnicki J.M. Bonnerot C. Grosjean H. Lapeyre B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A similar situation may have arisen in the double editing of tRNAThr in trypanosomatids, where a single tRNA could be edited twice in the anticodon loop by a single deaminase with multisite and multinucleotide specificity. Although the analysis of tRNAThr(AGU) in T. brucei confirmed the presence of the two editing events, it also revealed that under steady-state conditions, one could detect A34-containing tRNAs. This is unlike other organisms, where the A to I reaction occurs so efficiently in vivo that the levels of the A34 intermediate are difficult to detect. The fact that both the in vivo and the in vitro data (Figs. 7 and 8) demonstrate the ability of the A34-containing tRNA to support amino acylation also argues for it to be functional in cytoplasmic translation. The wobble rules establish that inosine at position 34 may decode codons ending in A, C, or U. Inosine in tRNAThr may thus be sufficient to decode both the ACU and the ACC codons by wobbling. Why then do these cells keep a lower but significant number of A34-containing tRNAs? We suggest that in the trypanosomatid system, the I34-containing tRNA cannot readily wobble with a U-ending codon. Therefore both tRNAs are dedicated to the decoding of one specific codon, where the ACC codon is decoded by the double-edited and ACU codon by the unedited tRNA, respectively. In addition, recent evidence supports the view that posttranscriptional modifications play an essential role in achieving tRNA functional uniformity helping offset differences among various aminoacyl-tRNAs regarding their binding to the ribosome (34Fahlman R.P. Dale T. Uhlenbeck O.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 799-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We could also envisage a situation in which C to U32 editing is not only required for inosine formation in vivo but also enhances translational efficiency by providing the necessary changes for structural tRNA uniformity during translation. However, an in vitro translation system is not currently available for trypanosomatids, and answering these important questions will thus await further experimentation. We thank J. Rinehart, D.

Riboflavin (vitamin B2) serves as the precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), essential cofactors for several oxidoreductases that are indispensable in most living cells.

LS from fungi are c5-symmetric homopentamers, whereas the enzymes from plants, Archaea, and most eubacteria studied are 532 symmetric capsids of 60 identical subunits, which are best described as dodecamers of pentamers. The subunit folding patterns of pentameric and icosahedral LS are similar. In Bacillaceae, lumazine synthase and riboflavin synthase form a complex comprising an icosahedral capsid of 60 lumazine synthase subunits and a core of three riboflavin synthase subunits; historically, these unusual enzyme complexes were designated heavy riboflavin synthase (18Bacher A.

Riboflavin synthases from eubacteria are homotrimers where each subunit folds into two topologically similar domains, but the protein fails to obey trigonal symmetry. An active site is formed at the interface between the C-terminal domain of one subunit (serving as the donor site with regard to transfer of a for carbon moiety) and the N-terminal domain of an adjacent subunit (serving as acceptor site) (20Gerhardt S.

Crystals of wild-type MjaRS were grown at 18 °C using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal amounts of protein (6 mg/ml) in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 30 mm Tris and 2 mm dithiothreitol with a reservoir solution containing 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, and 40% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Crystals appeared within several days and belonged to space group P1 with cell parameters a = 41.9 Å, b = 72.9 Å, c = 72.7 Å, and α = 68.9°, β = 74.9°, γ = 75.1° corresponding to five monomers per asymmetric unit. Selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted MjaRS (6 mg/ml) was crystallized by mixing equal amounts of protein (6 mg/ml) at 18 °C with a reservoir solution containing 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.3, 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, and 20% polyethylene glycol 4000. The composition of cryoprotectant of the SeMet-substituted crystal was: 25% glycerol, 100 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. These crystals belonged to space group P63, with cell constants a = b = 103.8 Å, c = 129.4 Å and α = β = 90°, γ = 120°, also containing five monomers per asymmetric unit. The protein-inhibitor complex of native MjaRS with 6,7-dioxo-8-ribityllumazine (DORL) was obtained by adding the inhibitor in excess to native crystals. After an incubation period of 2 h, the crystals were flash-frozen in mother liquor in the cryostream. All crystals were measured at 100 K.

Bulk solvent, overall anisotropic B-factor corrections and non-crystallographic restraints were introduced depending on the behavior of the free R index. The complex crystals suffered from the soaking procedure and showed a diffraction pattern with large and smeared spots which might explain the rather high R-values.

Analysis and Graphical Representation—The pentacyclic reaction intermediates were energy minimized using SYBYL modeling software (32Tripos, I.

Correct atom types, stereocenters, hybridization states, and bond types were defined, and Gasteiger-Hückel charges were assigned to each atom. Positioning of these intermediates in the active site formed between adjacent monomers were carried out using the coordinates of the MjaRS-DORL complex and molecule A as the potential acceptor site. All interactions of molecule A of the complex structure, concerning its pteridine ring system and ribityl side chain persist in the model of the intermediate placed in the active site.

Protein Data Bank Accession Codes—The coordinates were deposited at the RCSB Protein Data Bank under the accession numbers 2B98 (native enzyme) and 2B99 (DORL complex). Recombinant RS of M. jannaschii (MjaRS) was expressed and purified as described (21Fischer M. Schott A.K. Römisch W. Ramsperger A. Augustin M. Fidler A. Bacher A. Richter G. Huber R. Eisenreich W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Crystals of MjaRS grew in space group P1, containing one pentamer in the asymmetric unit. The crystals diffracted to a resolution of 2.3 Å, and the structure was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion using selenomethionine-substituted protein, which was crystallized in the space group P63. An initial model was built in the experimental electron density and was used to position the molecule in the triclinic unit cell. Both crystal forms contain identical pentamers in the asymmetric unit that presumably correspond to the solution state of the protein. The final model of the pentameric RS of M. jannaschii consists of 725 residues with a well defined protein backbone. Poor electron density is present at the C-terminal region for three subunits of the pentamer (residues 143-153), but most of the side chains are clearly defined, except for some surface-exposed residues. The pentamer has a size of roughly 80 × 80 × 45 Å. The MjaRS-monomer forms a three-layered (αβα) structure with a parallel four-stranded β-sheet that is flanked on both sides by two α-helices (Fig. 2A). The secondary structure and topology of the monomer is described as β1α1β2α2β3α3β4α4α5β5β6. The active site is formed by the interface between two subunits of the pentamer. As mentioned above, the partial sequence identity between LS from different organisms and RS of M. jannaschii implicates a similar three-dimensional structure. Indeed, both monomer structure and the type and character of the interactions involved in pentamer formation are highly similar to LS. LSs exhibit a three-layered structure (αβα). The core of the monomer is reminiscent of the flavodoxin fold and consists of a central parallel β-sheet of four strands with topology β2β3β4β5 that is flanked on both sides by the α-helix motifs α1α4α5 and α2α3, respectively. A DALI search (37Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar) for similar structures found similarities to numerous proteins with a DMRL fold (SCOP 52121). The top DALI hits are the lumazine synthases from the following organisms: Brucella abortus (Protein Data Bank code 1DIO-A, Z-score 18.4, r.m.s.d. for 132 Cα atoms = 2.2 Å, sequence identity 14%) and Bacillus subtilis (Protein Data Bank code 1RVV-1, Z-score 16.7, r.m.s.d. for 129 Cα atoms = 2.1, sequence identity 22%). There are also considerable structural similarities to other proteins. One specific example with low sequence identity and an apparently different mode of substrate binding is the d-ribose-binding protein from Escherichia coli (Protein Data Bank code 2DRI, Z-score 11.1, r.m.s.d. for 121 Cα atoms = 2.6 Å, sequence identity 13%). Despite the small overall deviation between MjaRS and known lumazine synthase structures, there is a significant difference at the C terminus. At this region, MjaRS contains an alpha-helix and a two stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (Fig. 2B). This C-terminal anti-parallel β-sheet of MjaRS is located at the interface between adjacent subunits of the pentamer. The overall structure of the pentameric assembly of M. jannaschii riboflavin synthase viewed along the 5-fold non-crystallographic symmetry axis is shown in Fig. 2C. Details of the refinement and model statistics are given in Table 1. To identify the active site of the enzyme we soaked crystals of riboflavin synthase with the substrate analog inhibitor DORL. The refinement statistics of the inhibitor complex structure are summarized in Table 1. The overall folding of the enzyme in complex with the inhibitors is identical to that of the native structure (data not shown), except at the C terminus, which is involved in binding of one inhibitor molecule. Consequently this region is better defined by electron density. The chemical reaction catalyzed by RS requires the binding of two substrate molecules to the catalytically competent active site. In the crystal structure, nine out of these ten positions are occupied by the inhibitor molecules, although with slightly different occupancies as deduced from different temperature factors. The individual subunits of the pentamer are very similar with r.m.s.d. values between 0.1 and 0.36 Å, which is in the range of the experimental error. Pairs of DORL molecules are located in an anti-parallel orientation in the active site formed by two adjacent subunits facing very different environments (Fig. 3). The binding of the substrate analog inhibitors shows that one molecule lies at the bottom of the catalytic center and forms a hydrogen bond network with protein subunit C involving its extended ribityl side chain and the pteridine ring-system (Figs. 4 and 5). The ribityl side chain forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain of nitrogen Gly41, nitrogen Ile42, nitrogen and oxygen Glu97 and with the γ-carboxyl group of Asp44 (protein subunit E), and two hydroxyl groups (OH-2, OH-3) are linked to water molecules. In addition, the pteridine ring system of molecule A is sandwiched between the aromatic ring of Phe12 on one side and Ile42 and Cys76 on the other side (Fig. 5A). The carbonyl O-2 of A is in hydrogen-bonding distance to a water molecule, which in turn makes hydrogen bonds to the side chain of Thr10 and the backbone carbonyl of Met66. The amide group of Ile42 is directed toward the carbonyl O-2, and a similar interaction is found between the carbonyl O-4 and the backbone amide group of Gly68 (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 5Bonding topology of 6,7-dioxo-8-ribityllumazine bound to M. jannaschii riboflavin synthase.

The ribityl side chain of molecule B is exposed in the direction of the solvent, and the ribityl hydroxyl groups OH-1 and OH-4 interact with the side chain of Asp73 (chain C) and a water molecule, whereas the ribityl hydroxyl group OH-3 is directed to the side chain of Arg145 (Fig. 5B). The side chain of Arg118, which forms a salt-bridge to Glu104, lies coplanar to the pteridine ring system. The ϵ-NH1-group of Arg118 and O-δ of Glu104 are in a distance of about 3.5 Å to the N-8. Further hydrogen bonds are observed between the carbonyl O-4 and the side chain of His122. The carbonyl O-2 forms a hydrogen bond to the peptide amide group of Gln146 and to a water molecule, which is coordinated by the backbone groups of O Gln146, nitrogen Phe148, and N-1 of the pteridine ring-system (Fig. 5, B and C). Superposition of the four well defined substrate analog inhibitor pairs show no significant differences in the coordination and geometry (data not shown). The two pteridine ring systems are orientated at an angle of ∼60°. The pteridine ring system of the natural substrate DMRL has two methyl groups in position 6 and 7, while the inhibitor used in this study has two carbonyl groups at these positions. In the complex structure, the 7-carbonyl-O of molecule A points to the N-5 of molecule B at a distance about 2.8 Å (3.3 Å). The residues of the active site involved in coordination of the two substrate analog inhibitors are highly conserved in putative archaeal riboflavin synthases (Fig. 6). In all sequences, the phenylalanine stacking to molecule A is found in a position corresponding to Phe12 of the MjaRS. Structural superposition of the MjaRS-DORL complex with the Schizosaccharomyces pombe LS-riboflavin complex (1KYV (38Gerhardt S. Haase I. Steinbacher S. Kaiser J.T. Cushman M. Bacher A. Huber R. Fischer M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1317-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) reveals that the pteridine ring system of molecule A lies coplanar to the isoalloxazin ring of riboflavin. Likewise, the ribityl moieties of this substrate analog inhibitor and riboflavin have a similar orientation, suggesting that molecule A marks the acceptor site and molecule B the donor site (Fig. 3). The residue Ile42 at the opposite side of the pteridine ring system is also conserved. At position 76 of MjaRS, archaeal riboflavin synthases display a serine or cysteine residue. Similarly for the second binding site (molecule B) of the substrate analog inhibitor, residues Asp73, His101, Arg118, His122, and Arg145 are all invariant in putative archaeal riboflavin synthases (Fig. 6). Recent studies have identified a pentacyclic intermediate in the reaction trajectories of riboflavin synthases of an eubacterium, Escherichia coli, and an Archaeon, M. jannaschii which have been designated as Compound Q and Compound Q′, respectively (Fig. 7). Whereas these intermediates have identical constitutions, their respective chromophores are enantiotopic, and the intermediates per se are diastereotopic (since the ribityl side chains invariantly obey d-configuration in both pentacyclic intermediates). Notably, the intermediate Q produced by the eubacterial enzyme can serve as a kinetically competent substrate for the eubacterial but not for the archaeal enzyme; the intermediate Q′ produced by the archaeal enzyme is a kinetically competent substrate for the archaeal enzyme and not for the eubacterial enzyme (39Illarionov B. Eisenreich W. Schramek N. Bacher A. Fischer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28541-28546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The absolute stereochemistry of the pentacyclic intermediate of the E. coli enzyme could be determined by the comparison between the x-ray structures of the trimeric E. coli enzyme (that had been crystallized without a ligand) and an artificial monomeric form of the S. pombe enzyme (that had been co-crystallized with 6-carboxyethyl-7-oxo-8-ribityllumazine), and the configurations at the newly formed ring carbons were assigned to be 6R and 7S (Fig. 7) (20Gerhardt S. Schott A.K. Kairies N. Cushman M. Illarionov B. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Fischer M. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1371-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The DORL used for soaking experiments in the present study is isosteric with the natural substrate, DMRL. Hence, it appears plausible that the topological relation of the two inhibitor molecules at the active site emulate the topology of the actual substrate molecules prior to the dismutation reaction. Naturally, that topology defines the sterical constraints for dimer formation. Unless one assumes very far-reaching conformational reorganization at the active site in the course of the reaction (which appears unlikely in light of the rather rigid active site cavity), the only possible stereochemical outcome of the dimerization catalyzed by the pentameric Mja riboflavin synthase is the diastereomer Compound Q′ with 6S/7R configuration (Figs. 7 and 8). We are not aware of any other case in the literature where a given reaction proceeds via diastereomeric intermediates under the catalytic influence of enzymes from two different species. On the other hand, we must assume that the uncatalyzed formation of riboflavin from DMRL is bound to proceed via both possible stereochemical trajectories, although the free energy difference of the two diastereomers should result in different velocities. In any case, the stereochemical information of the pentacyclic chromophore is lost in the final steps of the trajectory, and the stereochemical course of the reaction does not influence the stereochemistry of the products (which is exclusively determined by the chiral polyol side chains). The fragmentation of the pentacyclic intermediates affording the products riboflavin and 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidine-dione (1) is believed to proceed via two consecutive and highly plausible elimination steps (Fig. 7) (40Illarionov B. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7224-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the trajectory conducive to dimerization is far from clear. Early work by Plaut, Wood, Pfeiderer, and their respective groups had established that the position 7 methyl group of DMRL is acidic with a pKa around 9 (41Pfleiderer W. Hutzenlaub W. Chem. Ber. 1973; 106: 3149-3174Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This unusually high CH acidity has been attributed to the resonance stabilization of the lumazine anion (13Beach R.L.

The authors quoted above have proposed several variations on a common theme for the transformation of DMRL into riboflavin (11Paterson T. Wood H.C.S J. Chem. Soc.

Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., Amsterdam1976: 737-746Google Scholar). Based on the x-ray structures reported in this work and in the paper by Gerhardt et al. (20Gerhardt S. Schott A.K.

Flavins and Flavoproteins, Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium. Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., Amsterdam1976: 737-746Google Scholar). Following the discovery of the pentacyclic intermediate, the consensus mechanism arising from the early work of the Wood and Plaut groups could be easily modified to incorporate the experimentally observed intermediate. Nevertheless, the revised mechanism (40Illarionov B. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7224-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) remains a matter of speculation, and the three-dimensional structures that are now available fail to resolve that dilemma. Thus, further study will be required on this highly unusual reaction that is conducive to the formation of one of the most widely used redox cofactor classes. The riboflavin synthases of Archaea have no detectable sequence similarity with those of eubacteria, yeasts and plants. However, their sequences and structures closely resemble those of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthases. Completely sequenced archaeal genomes typically comprise sets of two similar genes, which specify a riboflavin synthase and a lumazine synthase. Sequence arguments also showed that the divergence between the paralogous lumazine synthases and riboflavin synthases occurred early in evolution (21Fischer M. Schott A.K. Römisch W. Ramsperger A. Augustin M. Fidler A. Bacher A. Richter G. Huber R. Eisenreich W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The five topologically equivalent active sites of pentameric lumazine synthases are located at the interfaces between adjacent monomers of the pentamer. Two substrates, 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate (2) and 5-amino-6-(d-ribitylamino)-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione (1), have to be bound in the active site (38Gerhardt S. Haase I. Steinbacher S.

Recent studies with the lumazine synthase from B. subtilis suggested that the rate enhancement by the lumazine synthase is predominantly achieved by establishing a favorable topological relation of the two substrates. The cavity harboring the active site of the closely related pentameric riboflavin synthase of M. jannaschii is similar to that of lumazine synthases, but the enzyme has no detectable lumazine synthase activity. The binding mode of lumazine molecule A in pentameric riboflavin synthase closely resembles the pyrimidinedione binding site of lumazine synthases. On the other hand, the other part of the active site cavity forming the binding site for lumazine molecule B is structurally rather different compared with lumazine synthases (Fig. 3). Hence, it is not surprising that the activity of the ancestor is lost in pentameric riboflavin synthases. We thank Dr. Peter Goettig for his expert technical assistance."

In B16 melanoma cells, cAMP activates the Ras/Erk pathway, leading initially to stimulation but subsequently to long term (>24-h) inhibition of melanogenesis (dendrite extension and melanin production). Here we identify CNrasGEF as the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) involved. We demonstrate that CNrasGEF is expressed endogenously in B16 melanoma cells and that cAMP-mediated activation of Ras and Erk1/2 in these cells can be augmented by CNrasGEF overexpression and reduced by its knockdown by RNA interference. Moreover, we show that CNrasGEF participates in the regulation of melanogenesis. Knockdown of CNrasGEF leads to increased dendrite extension and melanin production observed ∼50 h after forskolin/isobutylmethylxanthine treatment, suggesting that CNrasGEF inhibits melanogenesis in the long term. Independently, we find that overexpression of CNrasGEF leads to apoptosis, whereas its knockdown by RNAi enhances cell proliferation, independent of cAMP. Collectively, these results suggest that CNrasGEF regulates melanogenesis but that it also has a distinct role in regulating cell proliferation/apoptosis. cAMP-dependent Ras activation has been demonstrated in numerous cell types, particularly of neuronal (including melanoma cells) and endocrine origin, but the Ras activator involved has not been identified.

Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). In several endocrine, neuronal, or Schwann cells and in some 3T3 cells, cAMP promotes cell proliferation, often by activating Ras. For example, in thyroid cells, cAMP-stimulated mitogenesis following thyroid stimulating hormone binding to its receptor is mediated via Ras activation, independent of protein kinase A (2Tsygankova O.M. Kupperman E. Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3609-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, cAMP-dependent activation of Erk in NIH-3T3 cells was recently demonstrated to be carried out independently of Rap1-Epac and instead was proposed to be mediated via Ras activation (3Enserink J.M.

The cAMP-dependent Ras activator involved in these cases has not been identified. Recently, a pathway for cAMP-dependent Ras/Erk activation (independent of protein kinase A or Rap1) has been proposed in melanoma cells (4Busca R. Abbe P. Mantoux F. Aberdam E. Peyssonnaux C.

Pigment Cell Res. 2000; 13: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Melanin synthesis takes place in intracellular organelles called melanosomes. Upon stimulation by UV radiation, several factors are released, including α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (10Hunt G. Todd C. Cresswell J.E. Thody A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 205-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a strong melanogenic factor that acts by binding to the melanocortin receptor, MC1R. MC1R is a G protein-coupled receptor coupled to Gαs, causing elevation of intracellular cAMP upon ligand binding. cAMP is a critical component of melanogenesis, which comprises both melanin synthesis and movement of melanosomes to newly formed dendrites at the cell periphery, from where melanin can be released and distributed. The melanogenic effects of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone can be mimicked by elevation of intracellular cAMP (e.g. with forskolin and IBMX) 4The abbreviations used are: IBMXisobutylmethylxanthineFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingGEFguanine nucleotide exchange factor8-Br-cAMP8-bromocyclic AMPGFPgreen fluorescent proteinFBSfetal bovine serumRNAiRNA interferenceWTwild type.4The abbreviations used are: IBMXisobutylmethylxanthineFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingGEFguanine nucleotide exchange factor8-Br-cAMP8-bromocyclic AMPGFPgreen fluorescent proteinFBSfetal bovine serumRNAiRNA interferenceWTwild type.

The latter effect was unraveled by demonstrating sustained inhibition (observed after 48 h) of melanogenesis with a specific mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor (PD98059) or overexpression of constitutively active Ras or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (16Englaro W.

This is believed to be caused by phosphorylation of microphthalmia transcription factor (also on Ser73), resulting in its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, leading to attenuation of melanogenesis (5Busca R.

Cell Res. 2000; 255: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).Based on the critical role played by cAMP-mediated Ras activation in melanogenesis, Busca et al. (4Busca R. Abbe P. Mantoux F.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2900-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) have proposed the existence of a cAMP-dependent Ras activator (guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GEF) in melanoma cells. We and others have previously identified a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, called CNrasGEF (also known as PDZ-GEF1, nRapGEF, RA-GEF, and RAPGEF2) (20Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L.

Our previous work showed that when expressed heterologously in HEK293T cells, CNrasGEF can activate Ras in response to elevation of cAMP levels (independent of protein kinase A), achieved by treatment with 8-Br-cAMP or forskolin plus IBMX (20Pham N.

We thereforeinvestigatedwhetherCNrasGEFcouldparticipateinthecAMP-dependent Ras activation in melanoma cells. Our work here shows that CNrasGEF is highly expressed in B16 melanoma cells, it can activate Ras and Erk1/2 in these cells upon cAMP elevation, and it plays an important role in regulating melanogenesis. We also show that CNrasGEF regulates cell survival of B16 cells, an effect not dependent on cAMP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstructs and Vectors—FLAG-tagged WT-CNrasGEF and FLAG-tagged ΔCDC25-CNrasGEF (lacking the catalytic Ras/Rap1-activating domain) were expressed from a pCMV5 vector as described previously (20Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Constructs expressing GFP-tagged WT- and ΔCDC25-CNrasGEF were generated by cloning the respective cDNA sequences from the pCMV5 constructs into pEGFP-c3 (WT) or pEGFP-c2 (ΔCDC25-CNrasGEF). A 64-bp oligonucleotide was inserted into the multiple cloning sites of pSuper-EGFP, a modified pEGFP-c1 vector (Clontech) that incorporates the promoter from pSuper H1 RNA flanked by multiple cloning sites (kindly provided by Dr. C. C. Hui, The Hospital for Sick Children). The 64-bp oligonucleotide was designed to form a small hairpin RNA targeting the following sequence unique to the N-terminal region of mouse CNrasGEF (mKIAA0313): AAACTGCACCTCACTGACAGC. As a control, a scrambled version of the above oligonucleotide was designed, containing the following sequence (not recognizing any coding regions in the mouse genome): AAGAACCTGTCAGCCACCTAC. The oligonucleotide strands were purchased from Sigma Genosys and were annealed and phosphorylated before cloning into pSuper-EGFP.pCGT vectors containing T7-tagged V12-H-Ras or N17-H-Ras were kindly provided by Dr. Dafna Bar-Sagi (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY).Cell Culture and Transfections—B16-F10 murine melanoma cells (hereafter called B16 cells), purchased from ATCC, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and 100 units of penicillin, 100 μg of streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's (Invitrogen) instructions.Analysis of Cell Proliferation and Morphology—Cells were transfected with pEGFPc1, pSuper-EGFP-CNrasGEF-RNAi (hereafter called GFP-CNrasGEF-RNAi or CNrasGEF-RNAi for short), pEGFPc3-WT-CNrasGEF (called WT-CNrasGEF), or pEGFPc2-ΔCDC25-CNrasGEF (called ΔCDC25-CNrasGEF) and sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) the next day to obtain a homogeneously transfected population, since transfection efficiencies ranged from ∼30 to 80%. The GFP-positive cells were reseeded at low density onto 6-well plates in medium containing 2% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin, since complete serum depletion did not allow the cells to survive for more than 24 h. After attaching overnight, cells were stimulated (or not) with 20 μm forskolin and 20 μm IBMX (Sigma) for periods of up to 72 h.Cells were photographed using a Leica DM IRE2 microscope with Openlab software at different sections of the wells, at 0, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h after stimulation, returning to the same cells at every time point. Cells with and without dendrites were counted, where “dendrites” were cell extensions that appeared over time. The percentage of cells with dendrites was calculated, and the 95% confidence interval for proportions of cells with dendrites (±1.96√(p(1-p)/n, where p represents proportion and n is total number of cells) was determined as described (25Motulsky H. Intuitive Biostatistics. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 11-21Google Scholar) and shown as error bars where appropriate (see Fig. 3).To construct growth curves, the total cell number/mm2 was plotted against growth time. The 95% confidence interval for counted cells (±1.96√n, where n = total number of cells) was determined, corrected for cells/mm2, and shown as error bars where applicable (25Motulsky H. Intuitive Biostatistics. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 11-21Google Scholar). The growth rate was determined by normalizing the number of cells/mm2 to the number obtained at the first measured time point, calculating the 2log value, and plotting against time.Short term dendrite formation was analyzed as follows. B16 cells were transfected as described above. Transfected cells were recovered for 15 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and with or without 20 μm forskolin/IBMX. Cells were analyzed using a Leica DM IRE2 microscope with Openlab software by counting GFP-fluorescent cells with and without dendrites, as described above.Apoptosis Analysis—Cells were transfected and sorted as described above and reseeded onto 4-well polystyrene vessel glass slides (BD Falcon). After 20–24 h, cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and permeabilized using ethanol/acetic acid (2:1). Fixed cells were stained for DNA damage using the ApopTag Red kit (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and mounted using Vectashield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). Cells were visualized and photographed using a Leica DM IRE2 microscope with Openlab software. Cells stained for apoptosis were counted and presented as percentage of total cells. The 95% confidence interval for proportions (±1.96√(p(1-p)/n), where p represents proportion, and n is the total number of cells) was determined as described (25Motulsky H. Intuitive Biostatistics. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 11-21Google Scholar).Determination of Melanin Production—B16 cells were grown to 50% confluence and transfected (or not) with CNrasGEF-RNAi or the scrambled control as described above. The next day, cells were reseeded 1:2 into new dishes, and the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and with or without 20 μm forskolin/100 μm IBMX. After 54 h of stimulation, cells were collected by trypsinization and divided into two equal batches. Half of the collected cells were lysed for protein analysis as described below. The other half was used to isolate melanin, according to a previously described protocol with slight modifications (26Ando H. Funasaka Y. Oka M. Ohashi A. Furumura M. Matsunaga J. Matsunaga N. Hearing V.J. Ichihashi M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1312-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 200 μl of double-distilled H2O and 1 ml of ethanol/ether (1:1), and incubated at room temperature for up to 1 h to remove impurities. Subsequently, the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 1 n NaOH, 10% Me2SO, and melanin was dissolved for 15–30 min at 70 °C. Melanin absorption was measured with a Beckman Coulter DU640B spectrophotometer at 470 nm.To determine the effect of Ras on melanin synthesis, cells were transfected with V12-Ras or N17-Ras and collected 48 h after stimulation with forskolin/IBMX. Melanin was isolated as described above.Western Blot Analysis—For protein analysis in growth, morphology, and melanin production experiments, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, 1% Triton X, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Total protein levels were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. An antibody generated against the carboxyl terminus of human CNrasGEF (20Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) was used to detect mouse CNrasGEF in all experiments. β-Actin (antibody from Sigma) was used as a loading control and to ensure that knockdown (where applicable) was not affecting all proteins in the cell nonspecifically. Relative CNrasGEF levels were quantified as protein band intensities using FluorChem densitometry software and normalized to β-actin levels.Ras Activation Assay—B16 cells were transfected, serum-starved overnight, and then subjected to treatments with 500 μm 8-Br-cAMP (Sigma) for 15 min. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaVO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the level of Ras-GTP in the lysates was determined using an activation-specific probe, as described (27de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, to determine the levels of active Ras (Ras-GTP) in cells, agarose-bound glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was used to precipitate Ras-GTP from cell lysates, and the amount of Ras-GTP was determined by immunoblotting with anti-H/N-Ras antibodies (Quality Biotech), since our unpublished work 5E. M. Amsen, N. Pham, Y. Pak, and D. Rotin, unpublished observations. demonstrated endogenous expression of N- and H-Ras (but not K-Ras) in B16 cells. Relative Ras and CNrasGEF levels were quantified as protein band intensities using FluorChem densitometry software and normalized to total Ras levels.Analysis of Erk1/2 Activation—B16 cells were transfected with GFP-CNrasGEF-RNAi, GFP-scrambled RNAi (control), and GFP-WT-CNrasGEF or GFP-ΔCDC25-CNrasGEF and FACS-sorted the next day. Sorted cells were reseeded in 6-well dishes and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% FBS for 24 h before serum starvation overnight. To study the effect of cAMP elevation, cells were stimulated (or not) with 20 μm forskolin/100 μm IBMX for 15 min and lysed on ice in a buffer with phosphatase inhibitors (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaVO4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaPPi, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Western blot was carried out on these lysates using antibodies against CNrasGEF and phosphorylated Erk1/2 (Promega). Total Erk1/2 levels were determined after stripping the blot and reprobing with an antibody against Erk1/2 (Promega).cAMP Production Assay—B16 cells were cultured as described above, and grown overnight in medium with different serum concentrations (0, 2, or 10% FBS). Cells were stimulated (or not) with 20 μm forskolin/IBMX for 1 h or 500 μm 8-Br-cAMP for 15 min. Intracellular cAMP levels were measured using the cAMP Biotrak enzyme immunoassay system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol.RESULTSCNrasGEF Is Expressed Endogenously in B16 Melanoma Cells and Is Able to Activate Ras and Erk1/2 in These Cells—To study the role of CNrasGEF in B16 cells, we first tested the level of its endogenous expression in these cells. As seen in Fig. 1, CNrasGEF is highly expressed in B16 (F10) melanoma cells relative to other cell lines analyzed. We have previously shown that overexpressed CNrasGEF in HEK293T cells activates Ras upon cAMP elevation (20Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24Pak Y. Pham N. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7942-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we tested whether it can also activate Ras in B16 cells in response to cAMP. Fig. 2, A and C, demonstrates that treatment of B16 cells with the membrane-permeant analogue of cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP, leads to Ras activation, in agreement with previous studies of Busca et al. (4Busca R. Abbe P. Mantoux F. Aberdam E. Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2900-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CNrasGEF in these cells causes an increase in Ras activation, which is further augmented by treatment with 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 2A). Thus, CNrasGEF can enhance Ras activation in B16 melanoma cells.FIGURE 1Endogenous expression of CNrasGEF in B16 melanoma cells. Cell lysate (50 μg of protein/lane) from HEK293T (293T), NG108-15 (NG108), or B16-F10 (B16) cells, as well as HEK293T cells overexpressing CNrasGEF, were immunoblotted with anti-CNrasGEF antibodies (right) or preimmune serum (left). The rightmost lane (HEK293T-transfected) represents a lower exposure time than the rest of the autoradiogram.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 2CNrasGEF leads to cAMP-dependent Ras and Erk1/2 activation in B16 melanoma cells. A–C, activation of Ras by CNrasGEF. B16 cells were transfected (or not) with wild type FLAG-tagged CNrasGEF (Flag-CNrasGEF), CNrasGEF-RNAi, or a scrambled sequence used as a control for the RNAi (B). Cells were then treated (or not) with the cAMP analogue, 8-Br-cAMP, and activated Ras (Ras-GTP) was precipitated from lysates with the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1. The lower panels in A and the top and bottom panels in C represent controls for total Ras, amount of transfected CNrasGEF (immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibodies), and amount of endogenous CNrasGEF, depicting knockdown of CNrasGEF with RNAi and some nonspecific knockdown with the scrambled control. There was some variability in the extent of knockdown by the scrambled control (compare B and C, top), but it was consistently smaller than the CNrasGEF-RNAi. The knockdown of CNrasGEF in B and C depicted is from cells treated with 8-Br-cAMP, but a similar effect was seen with untreated cells. Results shown in A–C are representative of seven experiments. Cells were not FACS-sorted for analysis of Ras activation. D, activation of Erk1/2 by CNrasGEF. Cells were transfected (or not) with GFP-WT-CNrasGEF, GFP-ΔCDC25-CNrasGEF, or GFP-tagged CNrasGEF-RNAi or a scrambled control. The population of transfected cells was enriched by FACS sorting. Sorted cells were treated (or not) with forskolin/IBMX. Active Erks were detected using Western blot with an antibody against phosphorylated Erk1/2, and levels were normalized to levels for total Erk1/2, detected after stripping and reprobing of the blot. The levels of endogenous or ectopic CNrasGEF were determined using an antibody against CNrasGEF. The top and bottom panels of Fig. 2D are representative of three experiments. Tfxn, transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further analyze the requirement of CNrasGEF for Ras activation in B16 cells, we knocked down CNrasGEF in these cells by RNAi. To achieve knockdown, we utilized a modified pEGFPc1 vector with an incorporated pSuper H1 RNA promoter and multiple cloning sites, where we introduced the CNrasGEF-RNAi hairpin oligonucleotide (see “Experimental Procedures”). This vector (called GFP-CNrasGEF-RNAi, or CNrasGEF-RNAi for short) thus expresses EGFP from a separate (cytomegalovirus) promoter than the RNAi. As seen in Fig. 2, overexpression of the CNrasGEF-RNAi construct in B16 cells resulted in a substantial reduction in the amount of CNrasGEF (but not of total Ras), suggesting that our knockdown strategy is effective. Some (variable) nonspecific knockdown due to overexpression of GFP alone or the scrambled control was also seen (Fig. 2, B and C, top), but it was not as pronounced as the knockdown by the specific CNrasGEF-RNAi. On average, specific knockdown by RNAi accounted for a ∼35% difference in CNrasGEF levels compared with the scrambled control. Transfection efficiency of both knockdown construct and scrambled control was ∼40–50%. We then tested the effect of knockdown of CNrasGEF on cAMP-stimulated Ras activation in these cells.

https://openalex.org/W2089648076,"Endostatin is an endogenous inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. It has two pairs of disulfide bonds in a unique nested pattern, which play a key role in its native conformation, stability, and activity. Here, we constructed a disulfide-deficient variant of endostatin, endo-all-Ala, to examine the effects of the two disulfide bonds on fibrillogenesis of endostatin under nondenaturing conditions. Based on thioflavin T fluorescence, atomic force microscopy, far-UV circular dichroism, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, we found that endo-all-Ala, which has a higher α-helical content compared with wild type, is prone to forming fibrils in a pH-dependent manner. Subsequently, more hydrophobic patches with a lower stability of endo-all-Ala were observed when compared with wild type, which possibly contributes to the propensity of amyloid formation of endo-all-Ala. To our surprise, the significant increase of the α-helical content in endostatin induced by trifluoroethanol can also facilitate fibril formation. In addition, the cytotoxicity of fibrillar aggregates of endo-all-Ala, which were generated at different stages of the fibril formation process, was evaluated by cell viability assay. The results indicate that the cytotoxicity is not due to the fibrils but rather due to the granular aggregates of endo-all-Ala. Moreover, endostatin was interestingly found to be reduced by glutathione at physiological concentrations. Our present work not only elucidates the correlation between the existence of disulfide bonds and the fibril formation of endostatin but also may provide some insights into the structural and functional basis of endostatin in Alzheimer disease brains.

Olsen B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4414-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Endostatin is a globular protein with two pairs of disulfide bonds (Cys33-Cys173 and Cys135-Cys165) in a unique nested pattern (14Ding Y.H. Javaherian K. Lo K.M. Chopra R. Boehm T. Lanciotti J. Harris B.A. Li Y. Shapiro R. Hohenester E. Timpl R. Folkman J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10443-10448Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These disulfide bonds, making the whole molecule tightly packed, are intimately related to the native conformation, stability, and activity of endostatin (15Zhou H. Wang W. Luo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11303-11312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been reported that endostatin is acid-resistant with slow kinetics upon acid-induced unfolding, which may be attributed to the two pairs of disulfide bridges (16Li B. Wu X. Zhou H. Chen Q. Luo Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2550-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, endostatin is highly resistant to trypsin digestion at 37 °C when the two pairs of disulfide bonds are removed (15Zhou H. Wang W. Luo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11303-11312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which may be considered to be one of the characteristics of fibrillar proteins like PrPsc (17Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5099) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between fibrillogenesis of endostatin and the two pairs of disulfide bonds under nondenaturing conditions has not been investigated so far. To investigate the effects of the disulfide bonds on fibrillogenesis of endostatin, an endostatin variant (endo-all-Ala), which is a genetically engineered disulfide-deficient variant of endostatin wild type (endo-WT), was constructed. In this study, substitution of all four cysteine residues with alanine, which is a conservative change (18Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19302-19307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was shown to lead to an enhanced pH-dependent fibrillogenic tendency when compared with endo-WT in aqueous buffer with no denaturants. Unlike disulfide-reduced endo-WT (19Kranenburg O. Kroon-Batenburg L.M. Reijerkerk A. Wu Y.P. Voest E.E. Gebbink M.F. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), however, endo-all-Ala is free of thiol residues and thus cannot cause intermolecular covalent cross-linking and aggregation via disulfide bonds. Therefore, endo-all-Ala is a good model for the study of fibril formation without the complications of added denaturants or reductants. Furthermore, the fibrillogenesis of endo-all-Ala can be investigated without consideration of the intermolecular covalent cross-linking caused by thiol residues. In our work, we found that endo-all-Ala rapidly forms amyloid-like fibrils at a mildly acidic pH. This mildly acidic pH always occurs in aged brains with cerebral acidosis (20Yates C.M. Butterworth J. Tennant M.C. Gordon A. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1624-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In contrast to endo-WT, endo-all-Ala at this acidic pH was shown to have more hydrophobic patches with a lower stability, which possibly contributes to the amyloid formation propensity of endo-all-Ala. Surprisingly, endostatin with a higher α-helical content induced by either mutagenesis or 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) is especially prone to generating fibrils. Moreover, during the fibrillogenic process at various time periods, endo-all-Ala produces distinct morphological types of aggregates. Among these aggregates, the granular aggregates can cause cytotoxicity toward rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Recently, Meyermann and co-workers (21Deininger M.H. Fimmen B.A. Thal D.R. Schluesener H.J. Meyermann R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10621-10626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) manifested the production of endostatin by neuronal cells and the localization of endostatin to Aβ plaques in Alzheimer disease brains. In the cytosolic environment of the nervous system, proteins may be exposed to strong reducing influences, such as GSH (22Freedman R.B. Cell. 1989; 57: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 23Raina S. Missiakas D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 179-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), antioxidants (24Rice M.E. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), and thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases (25Prinz W.A. Aslund F. Holmgren A. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15661-15667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Furthermore, superoxide produced under pathological conditions is a potent reducing reagent, which can reduce disulfides in proteins (26Peterson D.A. Archer S.L. Weir E.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our current study reveals that endostatin can be reduced by GSH in a simulated physiological environment in vitro. The structure of disulfide-reduced endostatin is similar to that of endo-all-Ala, which was verified by tryptophan emission fluorescence and far-UV CD spectra. Thus, the behavior of endo-all-Ala may be relevant to that of disulfide-reduced endostatin in vivo. These findings, combined with the in vitro cytotoxicity study, not only elucidate the effects of the unique nested disulfide bonds on fibrillogenesis of endostatin but also may provide some insights into the structural and functional mechanisms of endostatin in Alzheimer disease brains. Besides, protein aggregation can result in major economic and technical problems in biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries (27Fink A.L. Fold Des. 1998; 3: R9-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Our study may consequently illuminate some basic mechanisms for inhibiting the aggregation of endostatin during its extensive preparation, storage, and delivery for therapy. Protein Expression and Purification—Endo-WT and endo-all-Ala were expressed and purified essentially as described elsewhere (15Zhou H. Wang W. Luo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11303-11312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) with MGGSHHHHH at their N termini and purified via affinity chromatograph on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). Endo-WT and endo-all-Ala were refolded and purified by Protgen. The activity of refolded endostatin was analyzed and verified on the basis of the endothelial cell proliferation and migration assays as described (28O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3151) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined according to Edelhoch's method (29Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar). Fibril Formation—Endo-WT and endo-all-Ala were first dissolved in 30 mm acetate (pH 5.5) to make a stock solution, which was then diluted by aliquots into 10 mm sodium acetate buffer at different pH values. The stock proteins were filtered through a 0.2-μm cut-off filter to remove large particles that may act as seeds for fibril growth prior to the addition of buffer. The final protein concentration was 37.5 μm. ThT fluorescence was carried out after the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 81 h. ThT Binding Assay—Fluorescence was measured with a Hitachi FL-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer using cuvettes that have an optical path length of 1 cm. The temperature was maintained constant at 20 °C using an external bath circulator. Prepared fibril samples were diluted to 30 μm ThT in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, with a final concentration of 5 μm, and then the emission fluorescence intensity at 485 nm was monitored with the excitation at 442 nm. The slit widths were 5 and 10 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. For each sample, the fluorescence intensity at 485 nm was corrected by subtracting the emission intensity recorded before the protein was added to the ThT solution. In fibril growth kinetics experiments, at chosen time points, 70-μl aliquots of protein were removed from the fibril solution prepared above for the ThT binding assay. The ThT stock was filtered three times before use. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)—Fibril formation was monitored by AFM to identify and characterize intermediate species appearing on the aggregation pathway. At the time points of 0, 11, 41, and 81 h, a diluted aliquot (10 μl; 1:70 dilution in water for endo-WT and endo-all-Ala) of protein was sampled from the protein solution and deposited on a piece of freshly cleaved mica for 5 min. The mica was then rinsed with deionized water and blow-dried with compressed nitrogen. The dried substrate was transferred to AFM (Nanoscope IIIa Multimode AFM equipped with an E-scanner; Digital Instruments). Tapping mode images were obtained. The scan size was 2 μm. The image of endo-WT in 30% TFE was acquired with the same procedure. At least three regions of the mica surface were examined to confirm that similar structures existed through the sample. AFM image analysis was measured using the Nanoscope software (version 5.12r3). CD Measurements—Far-UV CD was recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature-controlled liquid system. The stock of proteins was diluted in 2 mm sodium acetate by aliquots to a final protein concentration of 2 μm. Cuvettes of 1-cm path length were used over the wavelength range between 190 and 250 nm. An average of four scans was obtained for all of the spectra. Photomultiplier absorbance did not exceed 600 V in the spectral region analyzed. Data were corrected for the buffer contributions. All of the measurements were performed under nitrogen flow. The results are expressed as mean residue ellipticity [θ] in units of degrees × cm2 × dmol-1 × 103. When the α-helical propensity of endo-WT was examined, endo-WT was dissolved into the sodium acetate buffer at pH 6.0 containing different concentrations of TFE (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30%), and then CD measurements were performed after the pH was checked. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy—Labile hydrogens in endostatin were replaced by deuterium through repeated cycles of lyophilization and dissolution in D2O. The spectra of endo-WT and endo-all-Ala were recorded using freshly dissolved solutions of proteins (20 mg/ml). Amyloid fibrils were formed by incubation of endo-WT and endo-all-Ala in D2O, pD 6.0 (measurements not corrected for isotope effects) for 81 h at 37 °C. The fibrils were concentrated by centrifugation before analysis. The FTIR spectra were collected on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences FTIR spectrophotometer equipped with a variable path length cell and purged with a continuous flow of dry nitrogen. Sample aliquots were placed between CaF2 windows separated by a 0.2-mm Teflon spacer. The cell path length was kept constant during all experiments. For each spectrum, a 256-scan interferogram was collected in single beam mode at 20 °C using a 4 cm-1 resolution. Fitting of the amide I′ band was performed using Gaussian curves. 1-Anilinonaphthalene 8-Sulfonate (ANS) Binding Assay—ANS binding assay was carried out with an FL-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi). ANS was added with a final concentration of 10 μm in 10 mm sodium acetate at different pH values. Endo-WT and endo-all-Ala were added with a final concentration of 1 μm. The ANS emission was scanned between 400 and 600 nm with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. The titration curves of ANS binding were monitored with the emission wavelength at 478 nm. A circulating water bath was connected to the fluorescence spectrophotometer with the temperature adjusted to 37 °C. Light Scattering—Protein samples were prepared as described under “Fibril Formation.” To monitor the protein polymerization, light scattering was performed immediately once the pH of the protein solutions was adjusted. Light scattering was measured in an FL-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi). Both the excitation and emission wave-lengths were set to 400 nm with a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm. All data were collected at 37 °C. Measurements of Tryptophan Emission Fluorescence—Fluorescence measurements were taken using a Hitachi FL-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer with a 1-cm light path at 37 °C. The excitation wave-length at 288 nm was chosen for the main contribution of tryptophan residues. The emission fluorescence spectra were collected between 300 and 400 nm with slit widths of 5 and 10 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. The scan speed was 240 nm/min. The protein concentration was 1 μm in 2 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.0) or 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). To avoid intermolecular cross-linking, the fluorescence of reduced endostatin was immediately tested after the pH of the solution was adjusted. Urea-induced Unfolding and Data Analysis—Stock solutions of endo-WT and endo-all-Ala were diluted into urea of different concentrations with a final protein concentration of 1 μm. The solution buffer is 2 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.0). The chosen temperature was 37 °C for mimicking the physiological condition. After the solutions were incubated at this temperature for enough time to reach the kinetic equilibrium, fluorescence measurements were performed. The excitation wavelength was 288 nm, and the emission was monitored at 350 nm. Urea-induced unfolding curves were analyzed by a two-state equation using the procedure of Santoro and Bolen, in which the native and unfolded base lines were determined by the data inside as well as outside the transition zone (30Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). Endo-all-Ala cannot be normalized to a two-state curve because of the marginal stability and the difficulties in finding its base lines. Cell Culture—PC12 cells (rat pheochromocytoma) were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Hyclone) containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin were added to the medium. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Assay—Aliquots of solutions containing different morphological types of aggregates of endo-all-Ala prepared as described under “Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM),” with 10μm final concentration or granular aggregates of endo-all-Ala with 1-10 μm final concentrations were added to the cell medium. After a 24-h incubation, 10 μl of a stock MTT solution in phosphate-buffered saline was added to give a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and incubated for another 4 h. After removing the medium with phenol red, 100 μl of cell lysis buffer (Me2SO) was added to each well, and the samples were mixed thoroughly by repeated pipetting with a multichannel pipettor. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the absorbance at 570 nm was measured on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Bio-Rad) with a reference wavelength of 630 nm. Each sample was assayed in hexad, and the assays were repeated twice. Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as mean values ± S.E. Multiple comparisons were performed by one-way analysis of variance, and differences with p < 0.05 were considered significant. Protein Reduction Assay—Endo-WT was incubated with GSH of 5-20 mm at 37 °C, pH 7.4. The concentration of protein was 0.5 mg/ml. The reactions were terminated at different time intervals by adding Laemmli SDS-PAGE nonreducing loading buffer. The samples were not boiled and then were analyzed on 12% SDS gels followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. pH Dependence of Fibril Formation of Endo-all-Ala—It has been well established that fibril formation requires appropriate physicochemical conditions, among which pH exerts a significant influence on the whole process of fibrillogenesis (31Lai Z. Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6470-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Hereby, the pH dependence of fibril formation of endo-WT and endo-all-Ala was evaluated initially. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 81 h at pH ranging from 3.6 to 6.6, and fibrils were quantified by ThT fluorescence. The enhancement in the fluorescence intensity of ThT upon binding to ordered protein aggregates is a rapid and sensitive method to show the presence of fibrils (6Levine H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). ThT fluorescence as a function of pH for endo-WT and endo-all-Ala was shown in Fig. 1A. As to endo-WT, no increased fluorescence was observed regardless of various pH values. The fluorescence for endo-all-Ala, however, increased rapidly from pH 4.3 to 6.0 and reached a maximum at pH 6.0. Above pH 6.0, the ThT fluorescence dropped markedly, and this process was accompanied by the spontaneous precipitation of endo-all-Ala (data not shown). These results therefore reveal that fibrils from endo-all-Ala form most readily under mildly acidic conditions from pH 4.3 to 6.0, whereas fibrils from endo-WT are not present, and only within this range of pH does endo-all-Ala exist in a well defined aggregated conformation after incubation for 81 h. The ThT fluorescence of endo-all-Ala increased nearly 200-fold from pH 4.0 to 6.0 in Fig. 1A. Then we determined the time course of the fibril formation of endo-all-Ala at pH 4.0 and 6.0 and 37 °C using ThT fluorescence (Fig. 1B). Amyloid fibril formation is a nucleation-dependent process, in which protein molecules gradually cluster together to form a nucleus, and the kinetics of fibrillogenesis can be described as a characteristic sigmoidal time course curve (32Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the fibril kinetic curve of endo-all-Ala at pH 6.0 was not sigmoidal and exhibited no observable lag phase, which suggests that endo-all-Ala forms fibrils rapidly without nucleation phases. After 81 h of incubation, the ThT fluorescence of endo-all-Ala at pH 6.0 increased to a maximal platform, indicating the end of fibril formation, whereas it kept unchanged at pH 4.0, which coincided with the results shown in Fig. 1A. Fibril Formation of Endo-all-Ala at pH 6.0—AFM images of time-dependent morphological types of endo-all-Ala aggregates generated by incubation at pH 6.0 and 37 °C in vitro were shown in Fig. 2. Consistent with our previous fibril kinetics data in Fig. 1B, amorphous granular aggregates composed of spherical particles predominated immediately after the pH was adjusted (Fig. 2A). Eleven hours later, short fibrils emanated from the globular granules, which indicated that fibrillar protein aggregates were beginning to form (Fig. 2B). In a similar sample recovered at 41 h, the fibrillar material was clearly evident, and the fibril extension continued (Fig. 2C). This fibrillar type resembles the protofilaments observed in other fibrillogenic systems, according to the size and characteristics of the aggregates (33Chiti F. Webster P. Taddei N. Clark A. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3590-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). After prolonged incubation for 81 h, the AFM image showed that the fibrils produced were long, smooth, and unbranched and possessed a rope-like structure with a width of 30-40 nm (Fig. 2D). In some instances, the image may represent overlapping fibrils. Based on the different morphological types of the aggregates, we classified them as granule, short fibril, protofilament, and fibril, respectively. The dimensions, including heights, widths, and lateral sizes, of the four types of the aggregates on mica were quantified by section analysis, and the results are shown in Table 1. Along with the increased height and width, the aggregates of endo-all-Ala continued to elongate as the growth of fibrils progressed. In contrast, when endo-WT was incubated under the same conditions for 81 h, there were only small spherical particles, which were probably the protein monomer molecules in appearance, with no evidence for extended fibrils characteristic of fibril formation (Fig. 2E).TABLE 1Dimensions of different types of fibrils from endo-all-ala grown on mica at pH 6.0 Protein was incubated at 37 °C, with a concentration of 37.5 μm.TimeHeightWidthLengthhnmnmnm01.7 ± 0.520 ± 435–50112.4 ± 0.622 ± 350–100412.6 ± 0.929 ± 4≤ 300812.8 ± 0.838 ± 5100–600 Open table in a new tab To further probe the properties of fibrils, we explored the secondary structural changes of endo-all-Ala due to the fibril formation at pH 6.0 by far-UV CD (Fig. 3). The difference of the spectra between endo-all-Ala before and after being incubated for 81 h showed a negative peak at 215 nm, which is a diagnostic mark for the presence of β-structure (34Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1338: 161-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Cross-β-structure has been represented as the fundamental polypeptide arrangement of fibrils (5Sunde M. Blake C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 123-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the secondary structure of endo-WT did not alter after the incubation. Finally, we used FTIR to test the presence of fibrils. FTIR spectroscopy can be used in the study of protein secondary structure in the dissolved, aggregated, and solid state (35Cooper E.A. Knutson K. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy Investigations of Protein Structure. Plenum Press, New York1995: 101-143Google Scholar). It is therefore a powerful tool for the study of conformational changes occurring during endostatin aggregation. As expected, the FTIR spectrum of endo-WT after the incubation did not make any change compared with that of the protein incubated before (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, the FTIR spectrum in the amide I′ region of endo-all-Ala before incubation was dominated by a strong band at 1640 cm-1, indicating a high proportion of random coil structure. Moreover, endo-all-Ala had a little amount of intermolecular β-structure based on the bands of 1618 and 1681 cm-1, which is accordant with the previous results in Figs. 1B and 2A. When the pD of the solution was adjusted to 6.0, endo-all-Ala could form g"

In a recent study in Nature Genetics, Hodges et al., 2005Hodges, C.A., Revenkova, E., Jessberger, R., Hassold, T.J., and Hunt, P.A. (2005). Nat. Genet., in press.Google Scholar show that mice with a mutation in the meiosis-specific cohesin protein SMC1β exhibit age-dependent defects in meiosis. These defects are similar to those observed in oocytes of older human mothers. Their results implicate an age-dependent loss of function in SMC1β (or related proteins) in the maternal age effect of humans. During meiosis in human oocytes, chromosome nondisjunction increases with maternal age, leading to disorders such as Down’s syndrome. In a recent study in Nature Genetics, Hodges et al., 2005Hodges, C.A., Revenkova, E., Jessberger, R., Hassold, T.J., and Hunt, P.A. (2005). Nat. Genet., in press.Google Scholar show that mice with a mutation in the meiosis-specific cohesin protein SMC1β exhibit age-dependent defects in meiosis. These defects are similar to those observed in oocytes of older human mothers. Their results implicate an age-dependent loss of function in SMC1β (or related proteins) in the maternal age effect of humans. The two divisions of meiosis are crucial for the production of male and female gametes. In the first step in meiosis, each of the two homologous chromosomes replicates to create two identical sister chromatids, and then the two homologs undergo pairing. These paired homologs, referred to as bivalents, are held together by crossover events. The sites at which crossovers occur are visualized as chiasmata. The actual segregation of homologs to opposite poles of the spindle occurs during anaphase of meiosis I, whereas the segregation of sister chromatids occurs at meiosis II. As human females age from 25 to 45, their risk of undergoing meiotic errors that result in failed homolog segregation (nondisjunction) increases dramatically. This rapid increase in the rate of nondisjunction causes the frequency of eggs and zygotes that are aneuploid for at least one autosome to increase by more than two logs as women age (see Figure 1, top panel). Since its discovery in the early twentieth century, this “maternal age effect” on meiotic nondisjunction has fascinated researchers who study meiosis (Hassold and Hunt, 2001Hassold T.J. Hunt P.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). In younger women, much of the observed nondisjunction reflects the aberrant segregation of chromosomes that either failed to cross over or recombined too distally to ensure segregation (Lamb et al., 2005Lamb N.E. Sherman S.L. Hassold T.J. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2005; 111: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Properly positioned crossovers play a central role in ensuring accurate segregation. Therefore, it is not surprising that those bivalents that have either no crossovers or crossovers located at the ends of chromosome arms are more likely to segregate incorrectly (nondisjoin) (Champion and Hawley, 2002Champion M.D. Hawley R.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: S50-S56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, as women grow older, the distribution of exchanges among nondisjoining bivalents becomes more similar to the distribution seen in normally segregating bivalents (Lamb et al., 2005Lamb N.E. Sherman S.L. Hassold T.J. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2005; 111: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, as a woman ages, the meiotic segregation machinery is impaired to the point that even bivalents with properly placed crossovers are likely to be nondisjoined. Accordingly, a real understanding of the maternal age effect will require identifying a defect that is powerful enough to disrupt the segregation of even those bivalents with properly placed crossovers. One significant insight into the events that might underlie these meiotic failures comes from the work of Angell and others (Angell, 1995Angell R.R. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 69: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, Pellestor et al., 2003Pellestor F. Andreo B. Arnal F. Humeau C. Demaille J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 112: 195-203PubMed Google Scholar, Wolstenholme and Angell, 2000Wolstenholme J. Angell R.R. Chromosoma. 2000; 109: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These researchers observed an age-dependent weakening of sister-chromatid cohesion that allows both the precocious separation of homologs (creating univalents) and the premature separation of chromosomes into separated sister chromatids. These observations suggest that the weakening of sister-chromatid cohesion might be an important component of the maternal age effect. Moreover, studies of meiotic nondisjunction in the fruit fly Drosophila support the theory that cohesion defects might underlie a maternal age effect. Bickel and colleagues have demonstrated that fly oocytes with a defect in sister-chromatid cohesion display a dramatic defect in the segregation of nonexchange bivalents, which increases in severity as the flies age (Jeffreys et al., 2003Jeffreys C.A. Burrage P.S. Bickel S.E. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 498-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Hodges et al., 2005Hodges, C.A., Revenkova, E., Jessberger, R., Hassold, T.J., and Hunt, P.A. (2005). Nat. Genet., in press.Google Scholar now present molecular evidence in favor of a cohesion defect mediating the maternal age effect in mammalian females. These authors characterized a mutation in a mouse gene encoding a meiotic cohesin protein, SMC1β. The mutant mice display age-dependent defects in the ability of chiasmata to hold bivalents together and in sister-chromatid cohesion. Most importantly, the meiotic defects in these mutant mice mimic those observed in oocytes produced by older human females. The Hodges et al. study raises the intriguing possibility that the age-dependent loss of either SMC1β or one of its protein partners within the cohesin complex may contribute to the maternal age effect. SMC1β is a meiosis-specific component of the cohesin complex, which plays a critical role in holding sister chromatids together in both meiosis and mitosis (Revenkova et al., 2004Revenkova E. Eijpe M. Heyting C. Hodges C.A. Hunt P.A. Liebe B. Scherthan H. Jessberger R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In meiosis, the maintenance of sister-chromatid cohesion is controlled in an exquisitely complex manner (Petronczki et al., 2003Petronczki M. Siomos M.F. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2003; 112: 423-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Until anaphase I, cohesin along chromosome arms is required for chiasmata to hold homologs together long enough to orient their centromeres to opposite poles on the meiosis I spindle. The release of cohesion along the chromosome arms, but not near the centromeres, then allows homologous chromosomes to segregate faithfully while holding sister chromatids together. In anaphase II, the centromeric cohesins are removed, and sister chromosomes segregate to complete meiosis II. Although mice homozygous for this smc1β disruption mutant are sterile in both sexes, the observed defects are quite different. Meiosis in male mutant mice is arrested quite early in meiotic prophase. In females, much of the observed sterility appears to result not from an arrest of the meiotic process but rather from the production of massively aneuploid oocytes. For example, both pairing and synapsis (as assessed by formation of the synaptonemal complex) and meiotic recombination appear to occur on schedule. Although the synaptonemal complexes in the smc1β disruption mutant are shorter than those observed in wild-type oocytes and recombination is somewhat reduced, a substantial fraction of the oocytes complete prophase and undergo apparently normal growth and maturation. However, following the completion of prophase, multiple defects in chromosome separation and segregation are observed. First, these oocytes exhibit a dramatic defect in their ability to bind exchanges in place. The sites at which crossovers actually occurred were distributed normally along the length of the chromosomes in pachytene. During diakinesis, the distribution of the resulting chiasmata displayed a strong skew toward the ends of the bivalents. Second, these authors also observed a much higher frequency of univalents than was expected based on the observed frequency of exchanges. For example, synaptonemal complexes lacking a crossover at pachytene were rare (< 1%), but univalents were commonly observed at diakinesis (19%). Thus, crossovers are occurring as they should, but, by diakinesis, the resulting chiasmata either have been displaced to the ends of chromosomes or, worse yet, have fallen off entirely, allowing the premature dissolution of the bivalent into two unconnected univalents. Given this apparent tendency of exchanges to simply “slide off” the bivalent, an expected defect in the absence of proper sister-chromatid cohesion along the arms of the chromosome, it is easy to understand why bivalents that start out with a crossover at the very end of a chromosome arm might be more susceptible to nondisjunction than bivalents with more central crossovers. One might also expect to see a preferentially strong effect on the separation of smaller chromosomes into univalents, which the authors indeed observe. Third and finally, the authors also saw clear evidence of well-separated sister chromatids at diakinesis. Perhaps most striking is the fact that the frequency of these defects, and especially the frequency of precociously separated sister chromatids, increases with the age of the mouse. The frequency of homologs exhibiting separated sister chromatids increases from 0% in mice aged 1 month to 83% in oocytes obtained from 6-month-old females (see Figure 1, lower panel). Thus, in oocytes obtained from 1-month-old mothers, the fraction of homologs observed as bivalents is 93.8%; by 2 months, this fraction declines to 35%, and by 4 months, it plummets to 0.3%. Clearly, Hodges et al., 2005Hodges, C.A., Revenkova, E., Jessberger, R., Hassold, T.J., and Hunt, P.A. (2005). Nat. Genet., in press.Google Scholar have created a mouse model that mimics several aspects of the maternal age effect observed in humans. How much of the maternal age effect does this model explain? Given that the cohesin complex is normally laid down during replication (which occurs in the human female in utero), the question is whether some components of the cohesin complex simply deteriorate with age. Alternatively, as the authors suggest, could meiotic cohesins be replaced during the process of oocyte growth and maturation, and is it this process of replacement that becomes defective with advancing age? Finally, as tempting as it may be to focus on the cohesin complex as the basis of the maternal age effect, there may be a variety of other processes, such as the change in the proper hormonal regulation of oogenesis, that might underlie this event (Hunt et al., 2003Hunt P.A.

https://openalex.org/W1990095884,"Members of the FXYD family are tissue-specific regulators of the Na,K-ATPase. Here, we have investigated the contribution of amino acids in the transmembrane (TM) domain of FXYD7 to the interaction with Na,K-ATPase. Twenty amino acids of the TM domain were replaced individually by tryptophan, and combined mutations and alanine insertion mutants were constructed. Wild type and mutant FXYD7 were expressed in Xenopus oocytes with Na,K-ATPase. Mutational effects on the stable association with Na,K-ATPase and on the functional regulation of Na,K-ATPase were determined by co-immunoprecipitation and two-electrode voltage clamp techniques, respectively. Most residues important for the structural and functional interaction of FXYD7 are clustered in a face of the TM helix containing the two conserved glycine residues, but others are scattered over two-thirds of the FXYD TM helix. Ile-35, Ile-43, and Ile-44 are only involved in the stable association with Na,K-ATPase. Glu-26, Met-30, and Ile-44 are important for the functional effect and/or the efficient association of FXYD7 with Na,K-ATPase, consistent with the prediction that these amino acids contact TM domain 9 of the α subunit (Li, C., Grosdidier, A., Crambert, G., Horisberger, J.-D., Michielin, O., and Geering, K. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 38895–38902). Several amino acids that are not implicated in the efficient association of FXYD7 with the Na,K-ATPase are specifically involved in the functional effect of FXYD7. Leu-32 and Phe-37 influence the apparent affinity for external K+, whereas Val-28 and Ile-42 are implicated in the apparent affinity for both external K+ and external Na+. These amino acids act in a synergistic way. These results highlight the important structural and functional role of the TM domain of FXYD7 and delineate the determinants that mediate the complex interactions of FXYD7 with Na,K-ATPase.

These results highlight the important structural and functional role of the TM domain of FXYD7 and delineate the determinants that mediate the complex interactions of FXYD7 with Na,K-ATPase. By using the free energy from the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule, Na,K-ATPase, a ubiquitous P-type ATPase, transports three Na+ out of the cell in exchange for two K+ into the cell. The minimal functional unit of Na,K-ATPase consists of a catalytic α subunit and a regulatory β subunit. Four α and 3 β isoforms exist and are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The major physiological role of Na,K-ATPase is to create and maintain the Na+/K+ gradient across the cell membrane, which is important for the maintenance of cell volume and membrane potential. Moreover, the Na+ gradient serves as an energy source for numerous secondary transport systems. Finally, Na,K-ATPase is essential for specialized functions of various tissues. In renal epithelial cells, Na,K-ATPase is exclusively expressed at the basolateral membrane and becomes the driving force for transepithelial Na+ reabsorption. In Na,K-ATPase the nervous tissue, restores Na+ and K+ gradients during action potentials and In skeletal and heart muscle, thus ensures neuronal excitability. the Na+ gradient coupled to Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity controls the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which influences muscle contractility. The activity of Na,K-ATPase is subjected to short- and long-term regulation (1Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mediated by the intracellular Na+ concentration, neurotransmitters, and hormones. Recently, members of the FXYD family (2Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) have been shown to be tissue-specific regulators of the Na,K-ATPase (3Crambert G. Geering K. Science's STKE. 2003; 166: RE1Google Scholar). FXYD proteins are small membrane proteins that are characterized by an N-terminal FXYD motif, two highly conserved glycine residues in the TM domain, and a serine residue at the cytoplasmic end of the TM domain. FXYD7, an O-glycosylated protein, is only expressed in brain, in both neurons and glial cells (4Béguin P. Crambert G. Monnet-Tschudi F. Uldry M. Horisberger J.-D. Garty H. Geering K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). FXYD7 associates with αβ1 isozymes, but not with αβ2 isozymes, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Stable association of FXYD7 with Na,K-ATPase modifies its apparent affinity for external K+ by increasing by ∼2-fold the K1/2 value for K+ over a large range of membrane potentials in the presence and absence of external Na+. In addition, FXYD7 modifies the apparent affinity for extracellular Na+ of Na,K-ATPase, probably by influencing the rebinding or release of Na+ to or from the extracellular medium (4Béguin P. Crambert G. Monnet-Tschudi F. Uldry M. Horisberger J.-D. Garty H. Geering K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In previous studies (5Li C. Grosdidier A.

In particular, Leu-964 and Phe-967 in TM9 contribute to the stable association, whereas Phe-956 and Glu-960 are involved in the transmission of the functional effect of FXYD proteins to Na,K-ATPase. Moreover, mutational analysis has revealed that the TM domain of FXYD7 plays a role in the structural and functional interaction of FXYD7 (6Crambert G. Li C. Swee L.K. Geering K. J. Biol.

To better understand the functional importance of the TM domain of FXYD proteins and the individual contribution of each of the twenty amino acid residues, we have in the present study replaced the amino acids of the TM domain of FXYD7 by tryptophan individually or in combination and have investigated their roles in the structural and functional association with Na,K-ATPase. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutations and alanine were introduced into the TM domain of mouse FXYD7 (4Béguin P. Crambert G. Monnet-Tschudi F. Uldry M. Horisberger J.-D. Garty H. Geering K.

Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The insert of FXYD7 was subcloned into a pSD5 vector using EcoR I/NotI restriction sites. The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. cDNAs for rat Na,K-ATPase α1 and β1 subunits were kindly provided by J. Lingrel. Protein Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—cRNAs were obtained by in vitro transcription (11Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Stage V-VI Xenopus oocytes were obtained as described (12Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with cRNAs coding for rat Na,K-ATPase α1 and β1 subunit (10 and 1 ng/oocyte) either alone or together with cRNAs for wild type or mutant mouse FXYD7 (2 ng/oocyte). To ensure that FXYD7 is expressed in excess over Na,K-ATPase for association and function analysis, we determined in preliminary experiments that maximal association of FXYD7 with Na,K-ATPase is achieved after injection of 1 ng of wild type FXYD7 cRNA (data not shown). Oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's solution in the presence of 0.8–1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (Easy Tag Express 35S protein labeling kit; PerkinElmer) at 19 °C and subjected to a 6-h pulse and to 24- and 48-h chase periods in modified Barth's solution containing 10 mm cold methionine or to 24 h pulse and 48 chase periods. After the pulse and chase periods, oocyte extracts were prepared as previously described (12Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with a digitonin-containing buffer (0.5% w/v final concentration) and subjected to immunoprecipitations with FXYD7 antibodies (4Béguin P.

Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (5–13% gradients) or Tricinepolyacrylamide gels (16.5%) (prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions) and revealed by fluorography. Protein quantification was performed using a laser densitometer (KB Ultrascan 2202). Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired Student's t-tests. Electrophysiological Measurements—Electrophysiological measurements were performed 3 days after injection of Xenopus oocytes with rat wild type α1 and β1 cRNAs alone or together with FXYD cRNAs by using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Measurements of the apparent external K+ affinity were carried out as described previously (4Béguin P. Crambert G. Monnet-Tschudi F. Uldry M. Horisberger J.-D. Garty H. Geering K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) in the presence of 1 μm ouabain, which inhibits the endogenous oocyte Na,K pump, but not the expressed ouabain-resistant rat Na,K-ATPase. The maximal Na,K pump current and the apparent K+ affinity (K1/2K+), measured in the presence of 100 mm external Na+, were obtained by fitting the Hill equation to the data using a Hill coefficient of 1.6 (14Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Measurements of the inhibiting effect of 100 mm external Na+ on the K+-activated current of Na,K-ATPase were performed in the presence of 1 mm external K+ as described previously (15Horisberger J.D. Kharoubi-Hess S. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) in oocytes expressing rat Na,K-ATPase alone or together with wild type or mutant FXYD7. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired Student's t-test. Expression and Processing of FXYD7 TM Mutants—To analyze the role of the TM domain of FXYD7 in the structural and functional interactions with Na,K-ATPase, we have 1) inserted an alanine residue in three different positions (Fig. 1A, Ala1, Ala2, Ala3) and 2) replaced individually twenty amino acids of the TM domain by tryptophan (Fig. 1A). Alanine insertion into an α helix is believed to dislocate the N-terminal part of the helix by 100° with respect to the C-terminal part and consequently impede the structural and/or functional continuity of the helix (16Braun P. Persson B. Kaback H.R. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29566-29571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Tryptophan scanning has been used successfully to determine functionally important amino acids in integral membrane proteins (16Braun P. Persson B. Kaback H.R. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29566-29571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Hasler U. Crambert G. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 7946-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mutants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, metabolically labeled, and immunoprecipitated with an FXYD7 antibody. The expression level of all mutants was comparable with that of wild type FXYD7 (3 out of 23 mutants are shown in Fig. 1B). FXYD7 is O-glycosylated on three threonine residues (4Béguin P. Crambert G. Monnet-Tschudi F. Uldry M. Horisberger J.-D. Garty H. Geering K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). After a 24-h chase period, wild type FXYD7 and Q26W, T27W, G29W, M30W, T31W, L32W, A33W, T34W, M36W, V38W, G40W, and I44W mutants were completely processed from a core protein, seen after a 6-h pulse, to the glycosylated form (wild type FXYD7 and the I44W mutant are shown as examples in Fig. 1B). On the other hand, Ala1, Ala2, Ala3, V28W, I35W, F37W, L39W, I41W, I42W, I43W, and L45W exhibited a delayed processing as reflected by the presence of the core protein after a 24-h chase (for examples see Fig. 1B). However, all mutants were fully processed after a 48-h chase period, indicating that they are not severely misfolded and can exit the endoplasmic reticulum. Efficiency of Association of FXYD7 Mutants with Na,K-ATPase—FXYD7 mutants were co-expressed with Na,K-ATPase α and β subunits in Xenopus oocytes, and the efficiency of association was studied by co-immunoprecipitations under non-denaturing conditions using an FXYD7 antibody. Examples of such co-immunoprecipitations are shown in Fig. 2A. The association efficiency of all FXYD7 mutants was quantitated as the amount of co-immunoprecipitated α subunit after a 24-h pulse and a 48-h chase period corrected by the expression level of the α subunit (Fig. 2B). As previously shown (6Crambert G. Li C. Swee L.K. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30888-30895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), more α subunit is co-immunoprecipitated with an FXYD7 antibody after a 48-h chase period than after a 24-h pulse (Fig. 2C), indicating that FXYD7 associates post-translationally with Na,K-ATPase. All three alanine insertion mutants exhibited a strongly reduced association efficiency (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the integrity of the TM helix of FXYD7 and/or the relative orientation of the N-terminal extracellular domain and C-terminal intracellular domain are essential for correct association with Na,K-ATPase. In agreement with a role of the transmembrane domain, single mutations of Gln-26, Gly-29, Met-30, Ala-33, Ile-35, Gly-40, Ile-43, and Ile-44 significantly decreased the association efficiency with Na,K-ATPase after a 48-h chase period (Fig. 2C). Functional Effects of FXYD7 Mutants on Na,K-ATPase—FXYD7 increases the K1/2 value for extracellular K+ of Na,K-ATPase by ∼2-fold over a large range of membrane potentials (4Béguin P. Crambert G. Monnet-Tschudi F. Uldry M. Horisberger J.-D. Garty H. Geering K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We first determined the K1/2 values for K+ at –50 mV of Na,K-ATPase either expressed alone or together with wild type or mutant FXYD7 (Fig. 3A). None of the mutations completely abolished the regulatory effect of FXYD7. Ala2, Ala3, Q26W, G29W, and G40W mutants produced a significantly smaller change in the K1/2 value for K+ of Na,K-ATPase compared with that produced by wild type FXYD7, possibly reflecting the lower association efficiency. In contrast, the L32W, A33W, and I42W mutants had significantly higher K1/2 values for K+. On the other hand, Ala1, M30W, I35W, I43W, and I44W mutants produced K1/2 K+ values comparable with wild type FXYD7 despite their lower association efficiency (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the degree of co-immunoprecipitation observed in the presence of digitonin does not necessarily reflect the actual proportion of complexes between Na,K-ATPase and the mutants in intact cells but rather the detergent sensitivity for dissociation of these complexes, which is higher than that of complexes including wild type FXYD7. Finally, despite their efficient association, the V28W mutant induced a decreased and the L32W and I42W mutants an increased K1/2 value for K+ of Na,K-ATPase. Because FXYD7 mutations could have effects on the K1/2 value for K+ of Na,K-ATPase at membrane potentials other than –50 mV, we also evaluated the voltage dependence of the K+ effect for each mutant. Fig. 3B shows the voltage dependence of the K1/2 value for K+ of Na,K-ATPase alone or together with wild type FXYD7. FXYD7 mutants that induced a decrease or an increase in the K1/2 value for K+ at –50 mV showed a voltage dependence of the K1/2 value for K+ similar to that produced by wild type FXYD7 (the G29W mutant is shown as an example in Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained for FXYD7 mutants that did not change the K1/2 value for K+ at –50 mV (the L39W mutant is shown as an example in Fig. 3C). The only exception was the F37W mutant, which showed a slight modification of the voltage dependence of the K1/2 value for K+ of Na,K-ATPase at very negative membrane potentials compared with wild type FXYD7 (Fig. 3D). Thus, Val-28, Leu-32, Ile-42, and Phe-37, which produce an increase or a decrease in the K1/2 value for K+ or a slight modification of its voltage dependence, are important for the functional effect of FXYD7 on the apparent K+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase without being implicated in the association efficiency. To further confirm the functional significance of these residues, we replaced Phe-37 by an alanine residue that is less similar to phenylalanine than tryptophan and produced a double V28W/I42W and a triple V28W/I42W/L32W mutant. All mutants associated efficiently with Na,K-ATPase, comparable with wild type FXYD7 (Fig. 4, A and C). As shown in Fig. 4D, the F37A mutant produced a different and much more pronounced effect on the voltage dependence of the K+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase than the F37W mutant (Fig. 3D), confirming the role of Phe-37 in the K+ effect of FXYD7. As shown in Fig. 3A, the V28W mutant decreased and the I42W mutant increased the K1/2 value for K+. Significantly, double mutations of Val-28 and Ile-42 abrogated the functional effect of FXYD7 (Fig. 4E). When a L32W mutation, which on its own produced a more pronounced effect on the K1/2 for K+ than wild type FXYD7 (Fig. 3A), was included into the V28W/I42W mutant, the functional effect on the apparent K+ affinity was regained (Fig. 4F). Altogether, these results indicate that Val-28, Leu-32, Ile-42, and Phe-37 play a specific role in the transmission of the functional effect of FXYD7 on the apparent K+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase. FXYD7 not only has an effect on the apparent affinity for extracellular K+ but also increases the apparent affinity for extracellular Na+ of Na,K-ATPase (4Béguin P. Crambert G. Monnet-Tschudi F. Uldry M. Horisberger J.-D. Garty H. Geering K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Extracellular Na+ binding is reflected in a voltage-dependent inhibition of the K+-activated pump current by extracellular Na+ measured at 1 mm extracellular K+ (20Vasilets L.A. Ohta T. Noguchi S. Kawamura M. Schwarz W. Eur. Biophys. J. 1993; 21: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, FXYD7 increased the inhibition of the Na,K pump current by 100 mm extracellular Na+ over a large range of membrane potentials and thus increased the apparent affinity for extracellular Na+ of Na,K-ATPase. Most FXYD mutants produced an inhibition of Na,K pump currents by extracellular Na+ similar to that produced by wild type FXYD7 (the I44W mutant is shown as an example in Fig. 5B). However, M30W (Fig. 5C), A33W (Fig. 5D), V28W (Fig. 5E), and I42W (Fig. 5F) mutants further increased the inhibition by extracellular Na+. A double mutant, V28W/I42W (Fig. 5) abolished the effect of the I42W mutant observed at negative membrane potentials and decreased the effect of the V28W mutant observed at less negative and positive membrane potentials. These results show that Val-28 and Ile-42 are involved in the effect of FXYD7 on the apparent affinity for K+ (Fig. 3) as well as on the apparent affinity for extracellular Na+ of Na,K-ATPase and that they act in a synergistic way to produce their effect. In this study, we have demonstrated the importance of the TM domain of FXYD7 in the interaction with Na,K-ATPase and have identified amino acids that are implicated in the efficient association and/or the functional effects of FXYD7 (Fig. 6). Our results show that Val-28, Leu-32, Phe-37, and Ile-42 in FXYD7 do not play a role in the efficient association with Na,K-ATPase but contribute to the functional effect of FXYD7 on the apparent affinity for extracellular Na+ and/or K+. Phe-37 and Leu-32 have an effect only on the apparent affinity for extracellular K+, indicating that the intrinsic affinity of the K+ binding site of Na,K-ATPase is modified. On the other hand, Val-28 and Ile-42 influence the apparent affinity for both extracellular K+ and Na+. Mutations of other amino acids such as Gln-26, Ala-33, Gly-29, Met-30, and Gly-40 lead to a decrease in the association efficiency as well as a perturbation of the functional effect on Na,K-ATPase. In this case, it is difficult to decide whether the reduction in the functional effect observed after mutation of these residues is due to inefficient association of FXYD7 with Na,K-ATPase or to a direct effect of the mutated residue inside the Na,K-ATPase-FXYD7 complex. However, rather than a decreased function, mutation of Met-30 produces an increase in the inhibition of Na,K-ATPase by extracellular Na+ and A33W an increase in the inhibition by extracellular Na+ and an increase of the K1/2 value for extracellular K+. These results suggest a functional role of these amino acids independent of their role in the association efficiency. Finally, mutation of Ile-35, Ile-43, and Ile-44 lead to a reduced association efficiency with Na,K-ATPase but do not perturb the functional effect of FXYD7. This result may indicate that co-immunoprecipitation experiments do not reflect the real amount of Na,K-ATPase-FXYD7 complexes in intact cells but rather give an indication of their detergent sensitivity. As indicated in Fig. 6, the strength of association of FXYD7 is determined by several amino acids in the TM domain of FXYD7. Any of the different contacts may weaken the strength of the association with the Na,K-ATPase α subunit and therefore affect efficiency of co-immunoprecipitation yet not prevent the association with the α subunit in native membranes. A distinction between amino acids that determine the structural and functional interaction of FXYD proteins has previously also been observed in TM9 of the α subunit of Na,K-ATPase (5Li C. Grosdidier A. Crambert G. Horisberger J.-D. Michielin O. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38895-38902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, our data on FXYD7 are in line with results obtained with FXYD2 and FXYD4 that suggest that the functional interaction is different from that determining the detergent resistance of FXYD-Na,K-ATPase complexes (8Lindzen M. Aizman R. Lifshitz Y. Lubarski I. Karlish S.J.D Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18738-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, amino acids such as Ala-33, Ile-43, and Ile-44 that were found to be important for the stable interaction of mouse FXYD7 with Na,K-ATPase correspond to Ala-34, Leu-44, and Ile-45 in rat FXYD2 that were shown to be involved in the greater detergent resistance of FXYD2-Na,K-ATPase complexes compared with FXYD4-Na,K-ATPase complexes (8Lindzen M.

Moreover, both in FXYD7 (this study) and in FXYD4 (8Lindzen M. Aizman R. Lifshitz Y. Lubarski I. Karlish S.J.D Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18738-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), mutations at positions Ile-42, Leu-39, and Met-36 in FXYD7 or the corresponding amino acids Leu-48, Ala-51, and Ala-54 in FXYD4 had no effect on the stability of interaction with Na,K-ATPase. These results strongly suggest that amino acids at similar positions determine the stability of interaction with Na,K-ATPase in all FXYD proteins. The results of our study permit us to delineate two distinct regions of the TM helix with different importance for the structural and functional interaction of FXYD7 with Na,K-ATPase (Fig. 6). Region A does not contain any residue that is involved in the structural or functional association with Na,K-ATPase. On the other hand, region B, which contains all structural and functional determinants of FXYD7 and which covers two-thirds of the TM helix, is likely to face the potential binding pocket for FXYD proteins composed of TM2, TM4, TM6, and TM9 of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit (21Hebert H. Purhonen P. Vorum H. Thomsen K. Maunsbach A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 479-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although TM9 of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit was shown to be involved in the interaction with FXYD proteins (5Li C. Grosdidier A. Crambert G. Horisberger J.-D. Michielin O. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38895-38902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), little is known about which part of domain B interacts with this α TM domain. A docking model of Na,K-ATPase-FXYD7 complex predicts contacts of TM9 with Gln-26, Met-30, and Phe-37 of FXYD7 (5Li C. Grosdidier A. Crambert G. Horisberger J.-D. Michielin O. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38895-38902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These amino acids were shown in this study to be involved in the structural and/or functional interaction of FXYD7, which would be consistent with their interaction with TM9 of the α subunit. More studies are needed to position FXYD proteins in the binding pocket and to determine the TM domains of the α subunit and possibly the β subunit of Na,K-ATPase that interact with FXYD proteins and contribute to the stable interaction and the functional effects. It is, however, clear that several TM domains of Na,K-ATPase must contribute to the interaction with FXYD proteins. Amino acids that are important for the stable interaction and the functional effects of FXYD proteins are present in at least two faces of the FXYD7 TM helix. Interestingly, similar results were obtained for the inhibitory protein phospholamban of sarco (endo) plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) that is supposed to be located also in a transmembrane groove made up of TM2, TM4, TM6, and TM9 (22Toyoshima C.

It should be noted that no single mutation of amino acids in the TM domain completely abolishes the functional effects of FXYD7 and that amino acids involved in the functional effects are scattered over a large region of the FXYD7 TM helix. This result indicates that the functional effects are produced by a complex interplay of FXYD7 interactions with different TM helices of Na,K-ATPase. Most likely, these interactions influence the conformational changes during the transport cycle and, in consequence, the cation affinities of Na,K-ATPase. Alternatively or in addition, a modification of the closely located third Na+ binding site (19Li C. Capendeguy O. Geering K. Horisberger J.-D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12706-12711Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) could explain some of the effects. For instance, mutation of Met-30 increases the inhibition of Na,K-ATPase by extracellular Na+. A docking model between Na,K-ATPase-FXYD7 complexes predicts contacts between Met-30 and TM9 of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit (5Li C. Grosdidier A. Crambert G. Horisberger J.-D. Michielin O. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38895-38902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that is part of the third Na+ binding site (19Li C. Capendeguy O. Geering K. Horisberger J.-D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12706-12711Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the present study has provided new insights into the structure-function relationship of FXYD proteins in general and FXYD7 in particular and has emphasized the important role of transmembrane interactions of FXYD proteins and Na,K-ATPase.

Although the αHL pore is a homoheptamer, the Luk pore is formed by the co-assembly of four copies each of the two distantly related polypeptides, LukF and LukS, to form an octamer. Here, we examine N- and C-terminal truncation mutants of LukF and LukS. LukF subunits missing up to nineteen N-terminal amino acids are capable of producing stable, functional hetero-oligomers with WT LukS. LukS subunits missing up to fourteen N-terminal amino acids perform similarly in combination with WT LukF. Further, the simultaneous truncation of both LukF and LukS is tolerated. Both Luk subunits are vulnerable to short deletions at the C terminus. Interestingly, the N terminus of the LukS polypeptide becomes resistant to proteolytic digestion in the fully assembled Luk pore while the N terminus of LukF remains in an exposed conformation. The results from this work and related experiments on αHL suggest that, although the N termini of βPFTs may undergo reorganization during assembly, they are dispensable for the formation of functional pores.

The pathophysiological effects of these proteins have been attributed to pore formation on target cells, leading to cell permeation or lysis. Leukocidin, in particular, has received widespread attention as an important virulence factor in wound and soft tissue infections (5Diep B.A. Sensabaugh G.F. Somboona N.S. Carleton H.A.

Excluding the amino latch and putative pre-stem regions, the protein displays a fold that is closely similar to the fold of an individual αHL protomer within the structure of the heptameric αHL pore (Fig. 1) (7Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar).

Together, the structures of the leukocidin monomers and the αHL heptamer represent beginning and end points in βPFT assembly. Additional evidence suggests that these proteins bind to membranes as monomers, associate on the membrane surface to form oligomeric prepores, and finally insert into the lipid bilayer (7Song L.

Chem. 2006; 281: 2195-2204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)).It has been proposed that the N termini of these βPFTs are crucial for the formation of functional pores (21Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N termini are believed to reorganize during the insertion step to form a “latch” that reinforces the interactions between neighboring subunits (7Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S.

Biol. 1999; 6: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, recent work from our laboratory suggests that, whereas this can occur, it is not required for pore formation in the case of αHL (Jayasinghe et al., preceding report (36Jayasinghe L. Miles G. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2195-2204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). Here, we use truncation mutagenesis to examine the contributions of the N and C termini of both LukF and LukS to the assembly of the leukocidin pore. We find the following: 1) Neither N terminus is required for pore formation; therefore, latch formation is not necessary for assembly of the pore. 2) The N termini of LukF and LukS reside in different conformation in the WT Luk pore: one is in the latch conformation and the other is not. 3) The C termini of LukF and LukS must be intact for efficient oligomerization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDeletion Mutagenesis—All constructs were made in the pT7-SC1 expression vector (9Miles G.

Synthesis was carried out for 60 min at 30 °C, and reactions were terminated with chloramphenicol (100 μm final). The complete amino acid mixture minus cysteine and the complete amino acid mixture minus methionine were mixed in equal volumes and replaced the individual amino acid mixture minus methionine (or cysteine) (2.5 μl) to yield “warm” radiolabeled proteins. Unlabeled (cold) proteins were generated by replacing the [l-35S]methionine or [35S]cysteine (1 μl) with water (1 μl).Oligomer Formation on Rabbit Erythrocyte Membranes—[35S]Met-labeled truncated polypeptide (IVTT, 25 μl) and its unlabeled wild-type counterpart (IVTT, 25 μl) (e.g. [35S]Met-labeled truncated LukF and unlabeled WT LukS), or in some cases both [35S]Met-labeled truncated components, were mixed and incubated with rRBC membranes (10 μl, 3.0 mg of protein/ml) (27Cheley S. Braha O. Lu X. Conlan S. Bayley H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1257-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in MBSA (10 mm 3-[N-morpholino]propane sulfonic acid (MOPS), 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), in a final volume of 100 μl. After 1 h at 25 °C,themixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant discarded. The membrane pellet was washed and resuspended in MBSA (80 μl) prior to solubilization by the addition of 5× Laemmli sample buffer (20 μl) (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). A portion (20 μl) was subjected to electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed in destaining solution (40% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 50% H2O) for 1 h prior to drying and autoradiography. Radiolabeled markers (14C-methylated proteins, no. CFA626) were from Amersham Biosciences: myosin (Mr 220,000), phosphorylase b (Mr 97,400), bovine serum albumin (Mr 66,000), ovalbumin (Mr 46,000), carbonic anhydrase (Mr 30,000), and lysozyme (Mr 14,300).Quantitative Hemolysis Assay—LukF, LukS, and the truncated polypeptides (IVTT, 5 μl of each LukF and LukS component) were diluted into MBSA (90 μl) in the first well of each column or row of a 96-well microtiter plate. The proteins were then subjected to eight or twelve 2-fold serial dilutions in the same buffer down the columns or across the rows (final volume 50 μl per well). An equal volume of 1% washed rabbit erythrocytes (rRBC) in MBSA was added to each well. Hemolysis was recorded for 2 h at 25°C by monitoring the decrease in light scattering at 595 nm with a Bio-Rad microplate reader (Model 3550-UV) and the Microplate Manager 4.0 software.Trypsin Treatment of Polypeptides on Membranes—Trypsin solutions (5.0, 0.5, and 0.05 mg/ml in water, Sigma, T-7309) were prepared by dilution of an enzyme stock (10 mg/ml in water) and used immediately. Wild-type LukF, wild-type LukS, truncated variants, and αHL were allowed bind to rRBC membranes before limited proteolysis was performed. The membranes were resuspended in MBSA (0.19 mg of membrane protein per ml) and divided into four tubes (18 μl in each). Trypsin or water (2 μl) was added to each tube. After 5 min at room temperature, the reactions were stopped by treatment with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (9 mm final, added in 2 μl of isopropanol) for 5 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of 2× Laemmli loading buffer. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.RESULTSHemolytic Activity and Oligomerization Properties of LukF N-terminal Truncation Mutants—Genes encoding truncation mutants of LukF in which the first 22 residues were removed one-by-one (Table 1) were generated by ligation-free in vivo recombination. The corresponding [35S]Met-labeled “warm” proteins were prepared by coupled IVTT by using an S30 extract from E. coli (29Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Kasianowicz J. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10902-10909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The truncated LukF polypeptides were tested for the ability to form SDS-stable oligomers on rRBC membranes with unlabeled (cold) wild-type LukS (9Miles G. Cheley S. Braha O. Bayley H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8514-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The lytic activity of leukocidin toward rRBC is normally at least 500-fold lower than that of αHL (2Prevost G. Menestrina G. Colin D.A. Werner S. Bronner S. Serra M.D. Moussa L.B. Coraiola M. Gravet A. Monteil H. Menestrina G. Serra M.D. Lazarovici P. Pore-forming Peptides and Protein Toxins. Taylor and Francis, London2003: 3-26Google Scholar). Accordingly, the extent of oligomerization of leukocidin is also significantly lower. Nevertheless, the N-terminal truncation mutants of LukF lacking up to 19 amino acids were capable of producing SDS-stable hetero-oligomers (Fig. 2A). Although, the extent of oligomerization of LukF-NΔ2 and LukF-NΔ3 is lower than that of the WT protein, mutants with more extensive deletions (LukF-NΔ5 to LukF-NΔ19) produced enhanced bands of leukocidin oligomer (Fig. 2A). Only a very weak oligomer band was detected (after prolonged exposure of film to the gels) after deletion of 20 or 21 residues (data not shown). We were unable to detect any SDS-stable oligomers on rRBC membranes after the removal of 22 amino acids or more (NΔ27, NΔ30, NΔ32, and NΔ43), even after prolonged exposure. All constructs (up to NΔ43), however, retained the ability to bind to the same extent to rRBC membranes as monomers (data not shown).FIGURE 2Oligomerization and hemolytic activity of LukF N-terminal truncation mutants. A, oligomer formation by LukF N-terminal truncation mutants examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. [35S]Met-labeled, truncated LukF polypeptides and unlabeled WT LukS were synthesized by IVTT. The two proteins were then mixed and incubated in the presence of rRBC membranes. An autoradiogram of a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel displaying the membrane-bound proteins is shown. Bands containing the Luk oligomer and the LukF monomer are indicated. B, quantitative hemolysis assays of LukF N-terminal truncation mutants in the presence of WT LukS. Both proteins were synthesized by IVTT. The assay was carried out for 2 h. Two-fold serial dilutions from top to bottom are shown, beginning with 5 μl each of truncated LukF and LukS in the first well (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The activities of wild-type LukF and the LukF deletion mutants were also compared in a quantitative hemolytic assay. Mutant LukF polypeptides with N-terminal truncations of up to 19 residues exhibited hemolytic activity comparable to WT LukF when mixed with WT LukS (Fig. 2B). Mutants with an additional one or two deleted residues, NΔ20 and NΔ21, showed a marked reduction in hemolytic activity (at least 30-fold less than the WT protein). LukF truncation mutants missing 22 amino acids or more (NΔ27, NΔ30, NΔ32, and NΔ43) did not lyse rRBC with WT LukS, even after 24-h incubation (data not shown).Hemolytic Activity and Oligomerization of LukS N-terminal Truncation Mutants—In a similar fashion, a series of N-terminal truncation mutants of LukS labeled with [35S]Met (warm, see “Experimental Procedures”) were produced with deletions ranging from 1 to 36 amino acid residues (Table 2). The truncated LukS polypeptides were tested for their ability to form SDS-stable oligomers on rabbit erythrocyte membranes with unlabeled WT LukF (9Miles G. Cheley S. Braha O. Bayley H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8514-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As in the case of the LukF truncations, all of the LukS mutants were capable of binding to rRBC membranes. SDS-stable oligomers were observed with N-terminal deletions of up to 14 residues, with the exception of LukS-NΔ8 (Fig. 3A). However, no oligomers could be seen with deletions of 15 or more amino acids (LukS-NΔ15 to NΔ18).FIGURE 3Oligomerization and hemolytic activity of LukS N-terminal truncation mutants. A, oligomer formation by LukS N-terminal truncation mutants examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. [35S]Met-labeled truncated LukS polypeptides and unlabeled WT LukF were synthesized by IVTT. The two proteins were then mixed and incubated in the presence of rRBC membranes. An autoradiogram of a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel displaying the membrane-bound proteins is shown. Bands containing the Luk oligomer and the LukF monomer are indicated. B, quantitative hemolysis assays of LukS N-terminal truncation mutants in the presence of WT LukF. Both proteins were synthesized by IVTT. The assay was carried out for 2 h. The first well contained 5 μl each of LukF and truncated LukS. Two-fold serial dilutions from top to bottom are shown (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Hemolytic activity similar to WT LukS was seen with N-terminal truncations of up to 14 residues, with the exception of LukS-NΔ8, in which case the activity was decreased at least by 15-fold (Fig. 3B). LukS-NΔ15 displayed a more pronounced lag in lysis (∼3-fold increase in lag time, defined as the time to lysis of 5% of a red blood cell suspension). No hemolysis was recorded with truncations of 16 or more residues, even when the microtiter plates were examined 24 h later (data not shown).Hemolytic Activity and Oligomerization of Mixed LukS and LukF N-terminal Truncation Mutants—To determine whether leukocidin could tolerate truncations of both components simultaneously, we studied the pore formed by LukF-NΔ16 and LukS-NΔ14. LukF-NΔ16 assembled with LukS-NΔ14 to form stable oligomers, albeit less efficiently than the WT subunits or one truncated subunit with its WT partner (Fig. 4A, lane 2). The hemolytic activity of the pair was at least 8-fold less than that of the WT components and the initial lag time was increased significantly (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Oligomer formation and lytic activity by combined LukF and LukS N-terminal truncation mutants. A, oligomer formation by LukF-NΔ16 with LukS-NΔ14 on erythrocyte membranes. The WT or truncated mutants (both components were labeled with [35S]Met) were assembled in the presence of rRBC membranes and subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. B, 2-h quantitative hemolytic assays of the subunit combinations shown in panel A. The first well contained 5μl of each LukF and LukS component. Two-fold serial dilutions were carried out from left to right (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Conformations of Leukocidin Polypeptides Probed by Limited Proteolysis—Trypsin has previously been shown to cleave αHL in solution at Lys-8 near the N terminus and at Lys-131 in the pre-stem domain, and has been used to probe the conformational changes at various stages of pore assembly (30Tobkes N. Wallace B.A. Bayley H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31Blomqvist L. Thelestam M. Microb. Pathog. 1988; 4: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The N terminus of αHL remains accessible in the membrane-bound monomer and in the non-lytic prepore state (21Walker B. Krishnasastry M. Zorn L. Bayley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21782-21786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Walker B. Braha O. Cheley S. Bayley H. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 99-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Upon insertion of the stem domain to form the transmembrane β barrel, the N terminus becomes occluded within the heptameric pore and is protease resistant (22Walker B. Braha O. Cheley S. Bayley H. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 99-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).However, the conformations of the N termini of Luk proteins in the assembled pore have not been studied thoroughly. We therefore probed the LukF and LukS polypeptides by proteolysis with trypsin and compared the results to those obtained with αHL. The N terminus of LukS was labeled by generating the LukS-D3C mutant by IVTT in the presence of [35S]Cys. The first trypsin site in this mutant is positioned after the cysteine, at position 9 (Fig. 5, A and B). Therefore, the radiolabeled [35S]Cys at position three acts as a marker for an intact N terminus in LukS (24Cheley S. Malghani M.S. Song L. Hobaugh M. Gouaux J.E. Yang J. Bayley H. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis and comparison of the crystal structures of the monomers revealed that the position equivalent to LukS-D3 is occupied by Ser-9 in LukF (Fig. 5A). Therefore, we also labeled the N terminus of LukF by generating the mutant LukF-S9C by IVTT, in the presence of [35S]Cys. Although the first trypsin cleavage site of LukF lies before the"
https://openalex.org/W2123783167,"Our previous studies showed that thymosin β4 (Tβ4) induced the synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) via the AP-1 dependent mechanism and its enhanced secretion. In this work we provide evidence that the released PAI-1 is accumulated on the surface of HUVECs, exclusively in its active form, in a complex with α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) that is also up-regulated and released from the cells. This mechanism is supported by several lines of experiments, in which expression of both proteins was analyzed by flow cytometry and their colocalization supported by confocal microscopy. PAI-1 did not bind to quiescent cells but only to the Tβ4-activated endothelial cells. In contrast, significant amounts of AGP were found to be associated with the cells overexpressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) without Tβ4 treatment. The AGP·PAI-1 complex was accumulated essentially at the basal surface of endothelial cells, and such cells showed (a) morphology characteristic for strongly adhered and spread cells and (b) significantly reduced plasmin formation. Taken together, these results provide the evidence supporting a novel mechanism by which active PAI-1 can be bound to the Tβ4-activated endothelial cells, thus influencing their adhesive properties as well as their ability to generate plasmin.

However, the precise molecular mechanism through which it functions and its potential role in solid organ wound healing remains unknown. In our studies of the biological activity of Tβ4 we found that this 43-amino acid peptide strongly activates endothelial cells to express and release plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). It occurs via the mechanism involving the signaling pathway leading to activation of the MAPK cascade and enhanced c-Fos/c-Jun DNA binding activity (4Al-Nedawi K.N. Czyz M. Bednarek R. Szemraj J. Swiatkowska M. Cierniewska-Cieslak A. Wyczolkowska J. Cierniewski C.S. Blood. 2004; 103: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Such a role of AP-1 in activation of transcriptional events by Tβ4 was confirmed by independent studies (5Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Tanom T. Bernard O. Narumiya S. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 29-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Recently, Tβ4 was reported to stimulate migration of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and promote survival of cardiomyocytes by formation of a functional complex with PINCH and integrin-linked kinase, resulting in activation of the survival kinase Akt (6Bock-Marquette A. Saxena M. White M.D. DiMaio J.M. Srivastava D. Nature. 2004; 432: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). These observations revealed that Tβ4 affects cellular functions by activation of several signaling pathways and induces changes in the cell properties necessary for both migration and survival. Here, we show that Tβ4 up-regulates expression and induces the surface accumulation of α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) known to bind PAI-1 and prolong its inhibitory activity (7Boncela J. Papiewska I. Fijal/kowska I. Walkowiak B. Cierniewski C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35305-35311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). AGP is expressed by activated endothelial cells and exerts its effect by interacting with components of the endothelial glycocalyx (8Sorensson J. Matejka G.L. Ohlson M. Haraldsson B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H530-H534PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we identify a previously unrecognized function of AGP, a direct and primary role in plasminogen activation. We provide evidence that the AGP·PAI-1 complex is assembled on the cellular surface, and formation of such a complex inhibits generation of plasmin. Interestingly all major components tested in these studies, namely PAI-1, AGP, and Tβ4 are up-regulated during inflammation. Therefore, the present results may indicate that a normally endogenous protein such as Tβ4, expressed in all types of cells, may be re-deployed to protect endothelium, for example, in the setting of acute inflammation events. thymosinβ4 plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 α1-acid glycoprotein horseradish peroxidase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum human umbilical vein endothelial cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Tris-buffered saline bovine serum albumin fluorescein isothiocyanate phosphate-buffered saline tissue plasminogen urokinase-type plasminogen lipoprotein receptor-related protein green fluorescent protein enhanced green fluorescent protein plasminogen. Reagents—Human PAI-1, α1-acid glycoprotein, Glu-plasminogen, and plasminogen-free fibrinogen were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co.

Declerck (Louvain, Belgium). Antibodies to AGP, mouse monoclonal antibody AAG2, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Aurora, OH). Monoclonal antibody to uPAR (#3936) was from American Diagnostica. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to PAI-1, MAI-12, were purchased from Biopool (Umea, Sweden). Anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and Wizard Miniprep and Maxiprep kits for isolation of plasmid DNA were purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). All standard tissue culture reagents including DMEM, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and Lipofectamine Plus reagent were from Invitrogen (Eggenstein, Germany). Cell Cultures—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from freshly collected umbilical cords by collagenase treatment (10Jaffe E.A. Minick R. Adelman B. Becker C.G. Nachman R.L. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 144: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and cell cultures were maintained as described previously (11Cieslak M. Niewiarowska J. Nawrot M. Koziolkiewicz M.

For the experiments, confluent cultures were used at the third passage. Human endothelial cell line EA.hy926, derived by fusion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with continuous human lung carcinoma cell line A549 (12Emeis J.J. Edgell C.J. Blood. 1988; 71: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained as a gift from Professor Cora-Jean S. Edgell (Pathology Department, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). This endothelial hybrid cell line is presently the best characterized macrovascular EC line (for review, see Bouis et al. (13Bouis D. Hospers G.A. Meijer C. Molema G. Mulder N.H. Angiogenesis. 2001; 4: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar)). The cells were cultured in DMEM with high glucose, supplemented with 10% FBS, hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine (100 μm hypoxanthine, 0.4 μm aminopterin, and 16 μm thymidine), and antibiotics in a 90-95% humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Monocytic cells (U937) cells were from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and cultured as described by the supplier. Measurements of PAI-1 and AGP mRNA—For this purpose, EA.hy926 cells were stimulated for 4 and 24 h with different concentrations of Tβ4 (0-160 nm), then total cellular RNA was extracted by the TRIzol reagent method (Invitrogen) using a single-step purification protocol (14Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar). RNA pellets were dissolved in water, and their concentrations and purity were determined by spectrophotometer readings at 260 and 280 nm. The relative amounts of specific mRNAs were quantified by RT PCR as described previously (5Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Tanom T. Bernard O. Narumiya S. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 29-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The following primers, 5′-GTCGAATTCCTGGAGCTCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCGCCACCTGCTGAAACA-3′ and 5′-GAGCATTTCGGATCCTTGCTGATCCTC-3′ and 5′-CAAGGCTGCTCGAGCTAGGATTCCCC-3′, specific for mRNA of PAI-1 and AGP, respectively, were used. In the same samples, β-actin mRNA was amplified with primers 5′-GTGGGGCGCCCCAGGCACCA-3′ and 5′-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′ and used as an intrinsic control of mRNA quantity PCR amplification. The final products were separated by electrophoresis in 7% polyacrylamide gels in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) using the genetic size marker 100 bp DNA Ladder (Promega). Bands were visualized by UV, the results were recorded photographically and analyzed densitometrically using an LKB Ultrascan XL Enhanced Laser Densitometer. Measurements of PAI-1, AGP, and Vitronectin by ELISA—HUVECs or U937 cells were plated in 48-well plates at the density of 2 × 105 cells/ml. On the next day, they were starved overnight in medium containing 0.1% FBS, and then stimulated for 24 or 48 h with different concentrations of Tβ4 or Tβ10 (0-80 nm). Afterward, the supernatants were collected and assayed for PAI-1 antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the Elisa-Imulyse PAI-1 kit. To measure AGP concentration in the conditioned media, a competitive inhibition ELISA was employed. For this purpose, the wells of 96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with recombinant AGP at 1.0 μg/ml in PBS. Unbound proteins were washed from the wells, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with TBS, pH 7.5, containing 1% BSA and 0.01% Tween 20 for an hour at room temperature. In competitive inhibition experiments, 50-μl aliquots of anti-AGP polyclonal antibodies, producing 60% of the binding to the immobilized AGP, were preincubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of the serial dilutions of the conditioned media. Then, 100-μl aliquots of the incubation mixtures were added to the wells coated with AGP and incubated over-night at 4 °C. Plates were then extensively washed with TBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The reaction was developed using ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) from Sigma at 1 mg/ml in 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 4.5, and the change in color was determined at 405 nm. To detect nonspecific binding, all assays were simultaneously done on plates coated with BSA alone and processed as described above. The background binding to BSA was subtracted from all samples before data analysis. Vitronectin was analyzed by a sandwich-type immunoassay using the ELISA assay kit HVNKT (Innovative Research Inc., Southfield, MI). Immunoprecipitation Experiments—The conditioned media were diluted 2-fold with TBS and incubated for 1 h with 10 μg/ml anti-AGP polyclonal antibodies and then precipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed with TBS and used for Western blot analysis with anti-AGP, anti-PAI-1 or anti-vitronectin antibodies, respectively. For the detection of AGP·PAI-1 complex in endothelial cells, EA.hy926 control cells, unstimulated and stimulated with Tβ4 (40 nm) or transfected with pEGFP-N1-AGP, were washed three times with Hank's balanced salt solution and treated with 200 nm AGP for 1 h at 37°C in serum-free medium or left untreated as controls. After addition of EGTA to a final concentration 10 mm, extraction of membrane-bound proteins was performed at room temperature for 20 min. Protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was added to extracts and they were centrifuged to remove cell debris. Supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-AGP polyclonal antibodies followed by Western blot analysis. Flow Cytometry—Subconfluent HUVECs and U937s were harvested and washed with serum-free DMEM. To evaluate PAI-1 bound to the cellular surface, cells were stimulated for 24 h with different concentrations of Tβ4 (0-80 nm), then incubated with FITC conjugated antibodies to PAI-1 (MAI-12) used at the concentration of 50 μg/ml. In other experiments, Tβ4 stimulated cells were incubated in the serum-supplemented medium containing AGP (200 nm) and PAI-1 (100 nm) or PAI-1 (100 nm) alone at 4 °C for 45 min. Then after washing, cells (2 × 105) suspended in DMEM containing 1% BSA were incubated in the dark at 4 °C for 30 min with FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against PAI-1 or AGP. After double washing with 1% BSA/PBS, the cells were fixed by mixing the sedimented cells with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS and resuspended in appropriate fluid for flow cytometry analysis. Fluorescence was measured with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed with CELLQuest software (BD Biosciences). Solid Phase Binding Assays—Binding of PAI-1 forms, active, latent, and substrate, to immobilized AGP was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The wells of 96-well microtiter plates were coated with AGP at 4 μg/ml in PBS. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Direct binding assays were performed by adding increasing concentrations of PAI-1 molecular forms in PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.002% Tween 80, pH 7.4. Then the plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C followed by detection of bound PAI-1 using MA-55F4C12-HRP. The background binding to BSA was subtracted from all samples before data analysis. Construction of EGFP-AGP Fusion Protein—Human AGP sequence was amplified from pGAD10 plasmid containing human cDNA library by PCR using primers 5′-CCTCCTGGTCTCGAGATGGCGCTGTCCTGGGTTCTTACAG-3′ and 5′-CCAAGGCTGTGTCCGGATCCGATTCCCCCTCCTCC-3′ and subcloned into XhoI and BamH I sites in pEGFP-N1. The obtained pEGFP-N1-AGP was propagated in Escherichia coli, purified with Wizard Midiprep (Promega), and sequenced to confirm the open reading frame. Plasmids containing the EGFP-AGP fusion construct were transfected into EA.hy926 cells with Lipofectamine. Briefly, 1.0 μg of plasmid DNA and 5 μl of Lipofectamine solution were incubated for 45 min in 200 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and then diluted with 800 μl Opti-MEM. This solution was added to growing EA.hy926 cells in 20% FBS medium. Expression of the fusion construct was evaluated by confocal microscopy after 24 and 48 h. Confocal Microscopy—For microscopic examination, cells (5 × 104 cells/ml) were plated on Permanox coverslips in 8-well tissue culture chamber slides (Nunc) with detachable chambered upper structures. After 24-h incubation, they were fixed with ice cold 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with blocking buffer (PBS containing 3% BSA). After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with biotinylated PAI-1 (100 nm) in the absence or presence of AGP (200 nm). After washing, the biotinylated PAI-1 was detected by incubation for 30 min with avidin-conjugated Texas Red rhodamine. The cells were then visualized using a helium/neon ion laser (543 nm excitation) and analyzed with MultiScan v.8.08 software. For intracellular probe visualization the confocal laser scanning microscope CLSM Phoibos 1000 (Amersham Biosciences) was used, which is based on a Nikon Optiphot microscope (equipped with Nikon oil immersion objectives 60 × NA 1.4 and 100 × NA 1.4 and with an argon laser with fluorescein filter, line selection 488 nm, dichroic mirror 510, emission 510 nm). Plasminogen Activation on the Cellular Surface—EA.hy926 and U937 cells were grown in the presence of different concentrations of Tβ4 (0-80 nm) for 24 h, and subconfluent cells were harvested, washed with serum-free DMEM, and suspended in 0.01 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.14 m NaCl and 0.1% BSA. After addition of uPA to a concentration of 1.4 nm, the cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, followed by three washes in 0.01 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.14 mm NaCl and 0.1% BSA. The cells were incubated at a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in 0.01 m Tris-HCl, 0.14 m NaCl with plasminogen (0.175 μm), and 0.2 mm H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-AMC (Bachem), a plasmin-specific fluorogenic peptide substrate. These incubations were made in 1-cm fluorometer cuvettes, which were maintained at 37 °C and gently stirred in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50 spectrofluorometer equipped with a micromagnetic stirrer. The fluorescence was measured continuously at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 480 nm. These data were converted to plasmin concentrations by calculating the rate of change in fluorescence between 1-min intervals and comparison with a calibration curve constructed using a standard plasmin. AGP Expression in Tβ4-stimulated Endothelial Cells—AGP, one of the major acute phase proteins, can interact with PAI-1 and stabilize its inhibitory activity toward plasminogen activators (7Boncela J. Papiewska I. Fijal/kowska I. Walkowiak B. Cierniewski C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35305-35311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Since AGP is synthesized by activated endothelial cells (8Sorensson J. Matejka G.L. Ohlson M. Haraldsson B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H530-H534PubMed Google Scholar), in preliminary experiments we tested whether its expression is influenced by Tβ4. Fig. 1A shows that treatment of endothelial cells with Tβ4 for 24 h resulted in up-regulation of AGP mRNA, even to a higher extent than PAI-1 mRNA. When used at 80 nm, Tβ4 increased the concentrations of PAI-1 and AGP mRNA by 8- and 10-fold, respectively. The specificity of this effect was evidenced by the fact that there was no increase in mRNA of t-PA, vWF or actin analyzed in the same samples. The specificity of the Tβ4 enhancing effect on expression of PAI-1 and other endothelial cells was well documented in our recent work (7Boncela J. Papiewska I. Fijal/kowska I. Walkowiak B. Cierniewski C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35305-35311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The same effect of Tβ4 on endothelial cells (HUVECs) and U937 cells could be observed at the level of AGP synthesis and secretion. In this experiment, endothelial cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of Tβ4, and aliquots of the conditioned media were collected at different time points then subjected to ELISA. Fig. 1B shows that Tβ4 significantly increased the levels of AGP secreted from HUVECs and U937 cells into the culture medium in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximum of AGP release was approached after treatment of the cells for 24 h with extracellular Tβ4 concentrations as low as 80 nm. To determine whether endogenous AGP is expressed on the surface of endothelial cells (HUVECs and EA.hy926) and U937 cells, each type was stained with anti-AGP monoclonal antibody AAG2 labeled with fluorescein. Unstimulated cells did not show the presence of AGP to be associated with their membranes (data not shown). However, treatment of the cells with increasing concentrations of Tβ4 (10-80 nm) for 24 h resulted in a marked increase of the relative fluorescence intensity of the FITC immunolabeling for AGP, indicating association of this protein with the activated cells (Fig. 2A-C).FIGURE 2Expression of AGP on cells activated by Tβ4. HUVECs (A), EA.hy926 cells (B), and U937 cells (C) were treated for 24 h with different concentrations of Tβ4 (20, 40, or 80 nm). The cells were detached, washed, and briefly fixed with paraformaldehyde. AGP was stained by fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody AAG2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Formation of the AGP·PAI-1 Complex on Endothelial Cells—Since PAI-1 14-1B showed the same binding characteristics as the active form of wild PAI-1 when its interaction with AGP was analyzed (15Smolarczyk K. Gils A. Boncela J. Declerck P.J. Cierniewski C.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12384-12390Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), it was used in all remaining experiments to maintain PAI-1 functional activity during the extended incubations required for different assays. The next experiments were designed to detect the PAI-1·AGP complex formation on HUVECs, EA.hy926 cells, and U937 cells. Immunolocalization by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and confocal microscopy were used to confirm the cell surface colocalization of PAI-1 and AGP. Similar to AGP, PAI-1 was not detectable on unstimulated HUVECs (Fig. 3A). However, incubation of Tβ4 stimulated HUVEC, EA.hy926, and U937 cells with anti-PAI-1 monoclonal antibody MAI-12 showed that these cells express substantial amounts of endogenous PAI-1 bound to their membranes (Fig. 3, B-D). Preincubation of both types of cells with stable PAI-1 mutant 14-1B (100 nm) resulted in a marked increase of the surface associated PAI-1 expression. When cells were first preincubated with AGP (200 nm) and then with PAI-1 (100 nm), the increase in PAI-1 expression on these cells was much more profound (Fig. 3, B-D). Since the presence of anti-AGP IgG virtually eliminated this additional increase in the binding of MAI-12 IgG to the cellular surface (data not shown), it thereby indicated that the binding of PAI-1 to endothelial cells was mediated by AGP. These experiments show that there are two pools of AGP and PAI-1 on Tβ4 activated cells: (a) the first one results from the enhanced endogenous expression of AGP upon activation of the cells with Tβ4 at the mRNA and protein level followed by their secretion, and (b) the second one caused by binding of added AGP and then PAI-1 to the membrane. We next turned to confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to explain which molecular forms of PAI-1 bind to endothelial cells and search for colocalization of AGP and PAI-1 at the cellular surfaces. EA.hy926 cells were transfected with pEGFP-N1-AGP expressing EGFP-AGP and then incubated with either active or latent PAI-1. Specifically bound PAI-1 was identified by staining with avidin-conjugated Texas Red rhodamine. Unstimulated endothelial cells did not show any binding of active PAI-1 (Fig. 4A, panels a-c) or latent PAI-1 (data not shown). EA.hy926 cells transfected with pEGFP-N1-AGP showed increased expression of AGP and bound exclusively the active form of PAI-1 which well colocalized with AGP (Fig. 4A, panels d-f). Since these cells were not stimulated it indicates that overexpression of AGP led to its secretion and thus the released AGP at least partly becomes associated with the cells. When such cells were stimulated with Tβ4, they showed higher expression of EGFP-AGP and bound significantly more PAI-1 (data not shown). There was actually no interaction of latent PAI-1 with the endothelial cells overexpressing AGP (Fig. 4A, panels g-i). This is clearly seen when fluorescence intensity was quantitated using ImageJ program (Fig. 4, B-D) To further support this observation, we analyzed the interactions of active, latent, and substrate PAI-1 with isolated AGP. For this purpose, increasing concentrations of PAI-1 were incubated with AGP immobilized on ELISA plate wells, and the bound PAI-1 was monitored with anti PAI-1 monoclonal antibody MA-55F4C12. Fig. 4E shows that AGP binds exclusively to the active PAI-1 molecule and does not interact either with substrate or latent PAI-1. Fig. 5A shows that when cells overexpressing AGP were activated by Tβ4, their morphology was strikingly changed. The cells containing the AGP·PAI-1 complexes were flattened and spread. In some cells, AGP was focally enriched in regions located subjacent to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5A, panels a-c), while in others AGP was diffusely present throughout the cytoplasm and was concentrated at the basal surface of the cell (Fig. 5A, panels d-f). Interestingly, PAI-1 is also enriched within these same regions (Fig. 5A, panels c and f) supporting our flow cytometry results indicating an association between AGP and PAI-1. Interestingly, such cells shed numerous microparticles that contained both AGP and PAI-1, as evidenced by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5A). These observations are supported by immunoprecipitation experiments, in which the conditioned media were tested for the presence of AGP (Fig. 5B). Significantly higher amounts of AGP could be immunoprecipitated by anti-AGP polyclonal antibodies from the conditioned media of EA.hy926 cells transfected with pEGFP-N1-AGP (Fig. 5B, lane c) when compared with control cells (Fig. 5B, lane b). This immunoprecipitate contained PAI-1 as detected by western immunoblotting but did not show any presence of vitronectin, even when tested by using a commercial sandwich-type immunoassay kit for vitronectin (Vitronectin ELISA assay kit HVNKT, Innovative Research Inc., Southfield, MI). The AGP·PAI-1 Complex and Plasmin Generation on Endothelial Cells—Accumulation of active PAI-1 in the complex with AGP on Tβ4-treated cells raised the possibility that this interaction might influence plasmin activation. To test this hypothesis, we measured plasmin generation by Tβ4 activated endothelial cells using the fluorogenic plasmin-specific peptide substrate, and conditions were established under which no plasmin was detected unless both plasminogen and sc-uPA were added to the cells. Substrate hydrolysis was subsequently monitored at 480 nm. Fig. 6A shows that when the concentration of Tβ4 added to EA.hy926 cells was increased from 0 to 80 nm, the rates of plasmin generation significantly decreased. The same direction of changes was observed when U937 cells treated with Tβ4 were used as a control (Fig. 6B), indicating that the released PAI-1 modified the fibrinolytic potential on both types of cells. The inhibition was abolished to a large extent by antibodies to AGP and PAI-1 in both types of cells (Fig. 6C). Similarly, a function blocking monoclonal antibody to uPAR neutralized the inhibitory effect of Tβ4 on U937 cells and EA.hy926 cells, while anti-αVβ3 antibodies used as a control did not show any effect. These observations support the role of AGP in accumulation of active PAI-1 on Tβ4 activated cells and its contribution for optimizing inhibition of plasmin formation on the cellular surface. In the present study, we have shown that activation of endothelial cells with Tβ4 results in accumulation of active PAI-1 on their cellular membranes complexed with AGP and, thereby, influences their fibrinolytic response. Specifically, we have provided evidence that (a) PAI-1, in contrast to AGP, does not bind to quiescent cells but only to the Tβ4 activated endothelial cells. The cell surface accumulation of PAI-1 on EA.hy926 cells is dependent on the synthesis of AGP induced by Tβ4. (b) AGP colocalizes with PAI-1 on activated endothelial cells, (c) cells enriched in such complexes showed a changed morphology by becoming larger and spread with the AGP·PAI-1 complex mostly located on their basal surface, (d) they have a reduced ability to generate plasmin on their surface in an AGP-dependent manner, and (e) the mechanism underlying this involvement depends upon the direct and simultaneous binding of active PAI-1 released by Tβ4. These interactions were demonstrable both with purified AGP in vitro (7Boncela J. Papiewska I. Fijal/kowska I. Walkowiak B. Cierniewski C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35305-35311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and on the surface of endothelial cells. The capacity of PAI-1 and AGP to interact on intact endothelial cells was detected by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy and further supported by contribution of both components in inhibition of plasminogen activation on the surfaces of both endothelial and U937 cells. A number of previous studies showed that components of the plasminogen system such as plasminogen, plasminogen activators, and their inhibitor, PAI-1, are localized or accumulated at the cell surface through specific receptors and hence are able to regulate pericellular proteolysis-related events (16Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Yutzy B. Lijnen H.R. Preissner K.T. Blood. 1998; 91: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bu G. Warshawsky I. Schwartz A.L. Blood. 1994; 83: 3427-3436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are differentially expressed on activated and motile cells including invading tumor cells, leukocytes, and migrating endothelial cells. However, there is little or no expression of these proteins on most normal, quiescent cells (18Mazar A.P. Henkin J. Goldfarb R.H. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 15-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). PAI-1 has the ability to interact, reversibly and irreversibly, with several proteins. In addition to plasminogen activators and other proteolytic enzymes, it is known to interact with the cell surface through (a) the uPA-receptor, thus inducing the internalization of the resulting PAI-1·uPA·uPAR complex. Such binding also leads to the deactivation and internalization of integrins that are bound to uPAR (19Simon D.I. Rao N.K. Xu H. Wei Y. Majdic O. Ronne E. Kobzik L. Chapman H.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3185-3194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) and inhibition of uPA-induced cell migration (21Czekay R-P. Aertgeerts K. Curriden S.A. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 60: 781-791Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In addition, (b) PAI-1, both free and in a complex with uPA, binds to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). All free forms of PAI-1, active, latent, and cleaved, can interact with LRP with a relatively low affinity and promote cell migration (22Degryse B. Neels J.G. Czekay R.P. Aertgeerts K. Kamikubo D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22595-22604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). PAI-1 in a complex with u-PA or t-PA interacts with LRP with high affinity and is efficiently endocytosed by cells. In this work we provide evidence that PAI-1 can also interact with AGP associated with cellular membranes. Recently, by screening the human liver cDNA library to search for proteins that bind PAI-1, we discovered AGP to have such an ability (7Boncela J. Papiewska I. Fijal/kowska I. Walkowiak B. Cierniewski C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35305-35311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Since AGP is known to localize at inflammation foci, it may provide the basic molecular framework for the concentration of PAI-1. Interestingly, Tβ4 is also accumulated in such areas, and particularly in wound fluid (3Grant D.S. Rose W. Yaen C. Goldstein A. Martinez J. Kleinman H. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Frohm M. Gunne H. Bergman A.C. Agerberth B. Bergman T. Boman A. Liden S. Jornvall H. Boman H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 24Huang W.Q. Wang Q.R. Exp. Hematol. 2001; 29: 12-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It suggests that AGP may serve as a receptor for PAI-1 on cells that naturally express low concentrations of membrane PAI-1 receptors. This may be the case with endothelial cells, which do not contain LRP (25Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Pallesen G. Cell Tissue Res. 1992; 269: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 26Lupu F. Heim D. Bachmann F. Kruithof E.K.O Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1438-1444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and show low expression of uPAR. In summary, the major observation of this work shows that vascular cells produce appreciable quantities of AGP, which may serve as a bridge for active PAI-1 on cells and in extracellular matrix, thereby concentrating and redistributing PAI-1 related biological activities. These cross-regulatory interactions provide additional points of control for cellular processes pertinent to cell adhesion and migration."

 The conceptual framework of evolution by natural selection that Charles Darwin laid out in the mid-19th century cannot help but clash with fundamentalist creation stories that invoke divine intervention operating on time scales that are inconsistent with myriad lines of scientific, observational evidence. In the United States, that tension has waxed and waned over the years. Lately, champions of creationism and its latest incarnation as intelligent design have been making inroads in the public education sector, often fomenting acrimonious debates about how biology and evolution ought to be taught. Antonio Lazcano, a biology professor at the Universidad Nacional AutA³noma de MA©xico (UNAM) in Mexico City, chronicles the way his own country has successfully negotiated what he argues is a healthy, reason-driven acceptance of Darwinian evolution even within a strongly faith-based Catholic context. While raising concerns that zealots from his country9s powerful neighbor to the north are trying to export their creationist views to Mexico and elsewhere, he suggests ways by which the vastly different realms of science and religion can let each other flourish in their own distinct cognitive domains.
