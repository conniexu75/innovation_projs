https://openalex.org/W1528985492,"The fate of vanadate (+5 oxidation state of vanadium) taken up by the red cell was studied using EPR spectroscopy. The appearance of an EPR signal indicated that most of the cytoplasmic vanadate is reduced to the +4 oxidation state with axial symmetry characteristic of vanadyl ions. The signal at 23 degrees C was characteristic of an immobilized system indicating that the vanadyl ions in the cytoplasm are associated with a large molecule. [48V]Vanadium eluted with hemoglobin when the lysate from Na3[48V[O4-treated red cells was passed through a Sephadex G-100 column and rabbit anti-human hemoglobin serum caused a hemoglobin-specific precipitation of 48V when added to the red cell lysate. Both results indicate that hemoglobin is the protein which binds cytoplasmic vanadyl ions. However, neither sodium vanadate nor vanadyl sulfate bound to purified hemoglobin in vitro. Finally, transient kinetics of vanadyl sulfate interaction with the sodium-and potassium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase showed that the +4 oxidation state of vanadium is less effective than the +5 oxidation state in inhibiting this enzyme. These results indicate that oxidation-reduction reactions in the cytoplasm are capable of relieving vanadate inhibition of cation transport."

https://openalex.org/W1494501092,"When nucleosomal core histones were isolated from rat liver nuclei incubated with [14C]NAD+ and fractionated into the individual components (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), [14C]adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADP-Rib) was found to be associated with all of them. However, while about 15% of the H2B molecules were modified, less than 2% of the other fractions contained radioactive ADP-Rib. The nucleotide attached to H2B was identified as a single monomer of ADP-Rib. On subjectint H2B to electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing 2.5 M urea and 0.9 N acetic acid, one single band of H2B with 5% less mobility than the unomdified control was obtained. The linkage between H2B and ADP-Rib was rapidly hydrolyzed with 0.1 N NaOH or with 1 M neutral hydroxylamine. Hydrolysis of ADP-ribosylated H2B with trypsin generated a single peptide linked to ADP-Rib, which corresponded to the sequence Pro-Glu-Pro-Ala-Lys. We were able to dansylate the NH2-terminal proline, which proved that the imino group of this amino acid was not substituted. These findings, together with the chemical properties of the linkage, which were typical of those of an ester-like bond, strongly suggest that the ADP-Rib residue was linked to the gamma-COOH group of the glutamic acid in position 2 of H2B."

https://openalex.org/W1535002454,"The photoaffinity label 8-azido[32P]adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (8-azido-cyclic [32P]AMP) was used to analyze both the cAMP-binding component of the purified cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and the cAMP-binding proteins present in crude tissue extracts of bovine cardiac muscle. 8-Azido-cyclic [32P]AMP reacted specifically and in stoichiometric amounts with the cAMP-binding proteins of bovine cardiac muscle. Upon phosphorylation, the purified cAMP-binding protein from bovine cardiac muscle changed its electrophoretic mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels from an apparent molecular weight of 54,000 to an apparent molecular weight of 56,000. In tissue extracts of bovine cardiac muscle, most of the 8-azido-cyclic [32P]AMP was incorporated into a protein band with an apparent molecular weight of 56,000 which shifted to 54,000 upon treatment with a phosphoprotein phosphatase. Thus a substantial amount of the cAMP-binding protein appeared to be in the phosphorylated form. Autoradiograms following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of both the pure and impure cAMP-binding proteins labeled with 8-azido-cyclic [32P]AMP revealed another binding component with a molecular weight of 52,000 which incorporated 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP without changing its electrophoretic mobility. Limited proteolysis of the 56,000- and 52,000-dalton proteins labeled with 32P from either [gamma-32P]ATP.Mg2+ or 8-azido-cyclic [32P]AMP showed patterns indicating homology. On the other hand, peptide maps of the major 8-azido-cyclic [32P]AMP-labeled proteins from tissue extracts of bovine cardiac muscle (Mr = 56,000) and rabbit skeletal muscle (Mr = 48,000) displayed completely different patterns as expected for the cAMP-binding components of types II and I protein kinases. Both phospho- and dephospho-cAMP-binding components from the purified bovine cardiac muscle protein kinase were also resolved by isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide slab gels containing 8 M urea. The phosphorylated forms labeled with 32P from either [gamma-32P]ATP or 8-azido-cyclic [32P]AMP migrated as a doublet with a pI of 5.35. The 8-azido-cyclic [32P]AMP-labeled dephosphorylated form also migrated as a doublet with a pI of 5.40. The phosphorylated and dephosphorylated cAMP-binding proteins migrated with molecular weights of 56,000 and 54,000, respectively, following a second dimension electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The lower molecular weight cAMP-binding component (Mr = 52,000) was also apparent in these gels. Similar experiments with the cAMP-binding proteins present in tissue extracts of bovine cardiac muscle indicate that they are predominantly in the phosphorylated form."

https://openalex.org/W1550470922,"Two distinct deoxyguanosine kinase activities have been identified in calf thymus tissue. They can be differentiated by subcellular location, electrophoretic mobility, chromatographic behavior, nucleoside specificity, apparent Km values, and end product inhibition. After a 130-fold purification from mitochondrial extract, the newly discovered kinase was specific primarily for deoxyguanosine and deoxyinosine. Unlike the cytosol enzyme, which proved to be the broadly specific deoxycytidine kinase studied previously, the mitochondrial enzyme does not phosphorylate deoxycytidine. Its apparent Km for deoxyguanosine, 6 micromolar, is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the cytosol enzyme. The mitochondrial enzyme is strongly inhibited by dGTP and dITP and activated up to 6-fold by dTDP and UDP, whereas neither dCTP nor dATP had much effect."

https://openalex.org/W1593980522,"Apolipoprotein B, the polypeptide moiety of human serum low density lipoprotein, is subject to degradation (as evidenced by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) both in the intact particle and after delipidation. Protease inhibitors, sodium azide, and nitrogen saturation did not influence the rate or degree of degradation. Lipid-free apolipoprotein B prepared by gel exclusion chromatography in sodium dodecyl sulfate bound a limited number of detergent molecules (up to 300) in monomeric sodium dodecyl sulfate solutions; circular dichroic spectra of this complex were similar to spectra of the intact lipoprotein. Near the critical micelle concentrations, a large, cooperative increase in detergent binding occurred, accompanied by circular dichroic changes indicating increased alpha helicity. By sucrose density centrifugation, lysopalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine could be substituted for the anionic detergent; about 300 mol of lysolipid were bound to the polypeptide. Replacement of detergent with guanidine hydrochloride by dialysis produced a soluble polypeptide with no ordered structure at denaturant concentrations above 7 M. At lower guanidine hydrochloride concentrations, structural elements were regained in a broad, reversible transition. It appears that apolipoprotein B is an easily degraded polypeptide with regions resembling water-soluble proteins but other regions which interact with lipid (or synthetic amphiphiles) and produce an overall insolubility in aqueous solution in the absence of amphiphilic ligands."

https://openalex.org/W1584102526,"The apolipoprotein B polypeptide of human serum low density lipoprotein exists (after reduction of disulfide bonds) as a random coil with a molecular weight of 250,000 in concentrated solutions of guanidine hydrochloride. With intact disulfide bonds, there is a limited restraint on the polypeptide conformation in this denaturing solvent. In the presence of saturating amounts of bound sodium dodecyl sulfate, the apolipoprotein is dimeric and highly asymmetric. This work substantiates the monomeric molecular weight of 250,000 for apolipoprotein B reported by others (Smith, R., Dawson, J.R., and Tanford, C. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 3376-3381) and demonstrates that the dimeric state of the polypeptide extant in vivo is maintained in micellar detergent solution."

While all of the recombinants studied contain the complete, potentially infectious viral DNA, in no case was the intact recombinant PY-plasmid DNA, or live Escherichia coli containing the recombinant plasmids, capable of inducing PY infection of mice, either by feeding or by parenteral injection."

https://openalex.org/W1677811082,"We have examined endogenous cyclic AMP-stimulated phosphorylation of subcellular fractions of rat brain enriched in synaptic plasma membranes (SPM), purified synaptic junctions (SJ), and postsynaptic densities (PSD). The analyses of these fractions are essential to provide direct evidence for cyclic AMP-dependent endogenous phosphorylation at discrete synaptic junctional loci. Protein kinase activity was measured in subcellular fractions using both endogenous and exogenous (histones) proteins as substrates. The SJ fraction possessed the highest kinase activity toward endogenous protein substrates, 5-fold greater than SPM and approximately 120-fold greater than PSD fractions. Although the kinase activity as measured with histones as substrates was only slightly higher in SJ than SPM fractions, there was a marked preference of kinase activity toward endogenous compared to exogenous substrates in SJ fractions but in SPM fractions. Although overall phosphorylation in SJ fractions was increased only 36% by 5 micron cyclic AMP, there were discrete proteins of Mr = 85,000, 82,000, 78,000, and 55,000 which incorporated 2- to 3-fold more radioactive phosphate in the presence of cyclic AMP. Most, if not all, of the cyclic AMP-independent kinase activity is probably catalyzed by catalytic subunit derived from cyclic AMP-dependent kinase, since the phosphorylation of both exogenous and endogenous proteins was greatly decreased in the presence of a heat-stable inhibitor protein prepared from the soluble fraction of rat brain. The specific retention of SJ protein kinase(s) activity during purification and their resistance to detergent solubilization was achieved by chemical treatments which produce interprotein cross-linking via disulfide bridges. Two SJ polypeptides of Mr = 55,000 and 49,000 were photoaffinity-labeled with [32P]8-N3-cyclic AMP and probably represent the regulatory subunits of the type I and II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases. The protein of Mr = 55,000 was phosphorylated in a cyclic AMP-stimulated manner suggesting autophosphorylation as previously observed in other systems."
https://openalex.org/W2023403288,"Sixty-eight independent hybrid clones were isolated after irradiated normal human lymphocytes were fused with Chinese hamster fibroblasts lacking hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity. The cells were grown under selective conditions requiring retention of the X chromosome-linked locus for human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. The frequency and patterns of cotransference of human phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase with the selected marker and with additional X-linked enzymatic markers confirm X linkage of the structural gene for human phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase and support assignment of this gene to a position on the long arm of the X, between the loci for alpha-galactosidase and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1586677548,"The region of the mtDNA containing the structural gene for apocytochrome b is called the cob or box region. There is evidence that the same region is also involved in the regulation of cytochrome oxidase. We have isolated eight mit- mutants in this region and have ordered them using petite deletion mapping. Four of these mutants appear to map outside the boxII region on the oli2-proximal end. Analysis of restriction endonuclease fragments of the mtDNA from peptides used in the deletion mapping suggests a minimum size of 3.1 x 10(3) base pairs for the whole cob region. Although none of our mutants contained any cytochrome b or cytochrome b-linked activities, polypeptides apparently related to apocytochrome b were present in some but not all mutants. Additional regulatory effects (both positive and negative) on cytochrome oxidase by virtue of control of its subunit I were also observed. In addition to these phenotypic traits, some of the mutants accumulated novel, mitochondrially translated polypeptides not seen in wild type."

https://openalex.org/W1502779904,"The ATP requirement during RNA transcription by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase associated with purified vesicular stomatitis virus was studied during chain initiation and chain elongation steps. Initiation of transcription in vitro has an apparent Km for ATP of approximately 500 micron, whereas the apparent Km for ATP during chain elongation is almost identical with those for the other three ribonucleoside triphosphates, i.e. 20 to 30 micron. Further analysis of the transcription process demonstrated that the beta-gamma imido analogue of ATP cannot be used for the initiation step. However, it can be incorporated into RNA during chain elongation. These results indicate that a hydrolyzable form of the beta-gamma phosphodiester bond in ATP is required for the initiation process and also support the hypothesis for a single promoter site for the initiation of transcription on the genome of vesicular stomatitis virus."
https://openalex.org/W177542464,"The enzyme succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase from pig brain has been 2000-fold purified by a combination of DEAE-cellulose, hydroxyapatite, and AMP-Sepharose chromatography. This preparation has a molecular weight of 160,000 and a specific activity of 5.3 mumol/min.mg at 25 degrees C. The inhibition of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase by carbonyl compounds, i.e. P-pyridoxal and o-phthalaldehyde was investigated in detail. The enzyme is reversible, inhibited by preincubation with P-pyridoxal (mixing molar ratio, 300:1) at either 25 degrees or 37 degrees C. Reduction with NaBH1 results in the incorporation of approximately 4 mol of P-pyridoxyl residues/mol of enzyme. NAD+ protects the enzyme against inactivation by P-pyridoxal, whereas the substrate succinic semialdehyde failed to prevent the reaction of P-pyridoxal with lysine residues of the protein. The binding of approximately 10 mol of o-phthalaldehyde/mol of enzyme results in irreversible loss of catalytic activity. The reaction is fast and easily monitored by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy."

https://openalex.org/W2052821654,The biological activity of recombinant phage and recombinant phage DNA containing monomeric or dimeric polyoma DNA inserts was examined in mice and cultured mouse cells. Recombinant preparations containing a single copy of viral DNA were invariably noninfectious; molecules containing a dimeric polyoma DNA insert were at least seven orders of magnitude less infectious than polyoma virions after parenteral inoculation. No infection was detected with any recombinant preparation after oral administration.
https://openalex.org/W1479913717,"The interaction of beta-endorphin with opiate receptors was studied by using the radioiodinated, metabolically stable D-Ala2 derivative of human beta-endorphin. This analog binds specifically to rat brain membrane preparations with an apparent Kd of about 2.5 x 10-9 M. The ability of various enkephalin analogs, as well as opiate agonists and antagonists, to inhibit the binding of beta-endorphin clearly demonstrates that this peptide can bind to opiate receptors. However, the effects of various cations on the binding of 125I-[D-Ala2]beta-endorphin are markedly different from those found for enkephalin binding. Sodium ion at physiological concentrations decreases substantially the binding of enkephalins but only slightly decreases endorphin binding, whereas manganese enhances enkephalin binding but has no effect on endorphin binding. Moreover, potassium (100 mM) decreases the binding of beta-endorphin but does not affect enkephalin binding. These results suggest that beta-endorphin and enkephalin bind differently to the same receptor or bind to different receptors with overlapping specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1971127559,"The cleavage sites of eight restriction endonucleases in linear spleen necrosis virus (SNV) DNA were mapped, and the map was oriented with respect to viral RNA. With the aid of this map, several structural features of the viral DNA were elucidated: unintegrated linear SNV DNA is terminally redundant; the majority of SNV DNA molecules integrated in chicken DNA, which were previously shown to be present in many sites in cellular DNA, are colinear with unintegrated viral DNA; no tandem integration of proviral molecules is detectable; and the majority of integrated SNV DNA molecules, including integrated SNV DNA molecules previously shown to be noninfectious, do not have an altered restriction enzyme digestion pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2010938080,"A rabbit antiserum has been prepared against the B95-8 transforming strain of EBV. The antiserum has a high virus neutralizing titer (approximately 1:1000) against both the marmoset B95-8 EBV and the human P3HR-1 EBV. The neutralizing antibodies may be absorbed completely with EBV producer cell lines, but not with nonproducer cell lines or producer cell lines treated with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) so as to be nonproducer. After repeated absorption with PAA-treated B95-8, the serum remains reactive with the membranes of producer cell lines as judged by immunofluorescence or the 125I--Staphylococcal protein A radioimmunoassay. Thus the neutralizing antigens are expressed on the membranes of producer cell lines and may be purified from this source using the serum and 125I--Staph A binding as an assay. The ability of the serum to differentiate between producer and nonproducer cells by means of cell surface determinants has been exploited to achieve a separation of these two populations from the same culture. Immunoprecipitation by the protein A technique shows that the serum recognizes two polypeptides from producer cells of approximate molecular weights 150,000 and 75,000."

https://openalex.org/W1643558629,"These studies describe the properties of three mit- mutants designated EM17, EM25, and PZ1, all mapping at two closely linked sites near one of the boundaries of the region of the mitochondrial genome concerned with the specification of cytochrome b. They all exhibit complex phenotypes affecting cytochrome b, cytochrome aa3, and additional polypeptides not found in the wild type. In the case of EM 17 this complexity can be ascribed to the presence of two mutations induced in the course of the initial mutagenic treatment: one, the cob2 mutation proper, is responsible for the loss of cytochrome b which is replaced by an altered, functionally inactive polypeptide, cytochrome b. This polypeptide can be further modified, or even eliminated, by the controlled introduction of another mutation in the cob1 segment of the cob region. The reduction in cytochrome oxidase subunit I, responsible for the effects on cytochrome aa3 and enzymatic activity in EM17, is due to a second (not mit-) mutation that has been located in the par1-proximal segment of the oxi3 region. This second mutation as well as the cob mutation can be overcome, and the respective aspect of wild type function restored to EM17, by recombination with rho- strains retaining the appropriate segment(s) of the wild type genome. The phenotype of the other two mutants is due to a single mutagenic event. This conclusion is confirmed by their ability to restore wild type functions by reversion. The mutation in EM25 appears to be due to a frameshift, which has led to premature chain termination, producing a polypeptide of Mr = 15,000 related to apocytochrome b. This change is accompanied by a decrease in the amount of subunit I of cytochrome oxidase. Revertants fall into three classes: on galactose two produce a polypeptide indistinguishable from apocytochrome b, but vary in its amount, while the third fails to increase apocytochrome b above mutant levels. Production of subunit I is increased but fails to reach wild type levels. Complete restoration of wild type functions can, however, be obtained by recombination of EM25 with rho- (cob2+) strains. Mutation PZ1 results in a complete absence of any polypeptide related to apocytochrome b and of cytochrome oxidase subunit I. These cells produce a novel polypeptide with a Mr = 45,000 not found in the wild type, and unrelated to all its normal polypeptides. Reversion or recombination with rho- (cob2+) strains results in virtually complete restoration of all wild type functions and the elimination of the novel polypeptide."

https://openalex.org/W1578737104,"Adipose tissue contains a high level of neutral esterase active against emulsions of cholesteryl oleate. The present studies show that this enzyme can also effectively hydrolyze the cholesterol esters in native rat plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL). The hydrolysis of lipoprotein cholesterol esters by a pH 5.2 isoelectric precipitate fraction from the freshly prepared 100,000 X g supernatant of chicken adipose tissue was low, but increased more than 50-fold on activation with cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Rat adipose tissue homogenates were also very active against lipoprotein cholesterol esters, hydrolyzing as much as 60% of the total labeled cholesterol ester in HDL or LDL in 1 h. Activity was optimal at pH 7 and very low at pH 4. No protease activity was detected at pH 7 and, since assays were done in 2 mM EDTA, phospholipase A activity was presumably negligible. The results show that hormone-sensitive cholesterol esterase of adipose tissue has ready access to the neutral lipid core of plasma lipoproteins, either because the enzyme penetrates the polar shell or because the cholesterol ester in the core is exposed, at least intermittently, to allow enzyme-substrate complex formation. Whether or not this enzyme activity plays a role in lipoprotein degradation by adipose tissue remains to be determined."

https://openalex.org/W1553384494,"Polysomes or mRNA prepared from cultured AtT-20/D16v mouse pituitary adenocarcinoma cells direct the efficient incorporation of amino acid into newly synthesized material in the presence of wheat germ translational factors. A significant franction of the total cell-free product is specifically immunoprecipitable with corticotropin antibody purified by immune affinity chromatography. Analysis of the cell-free synthesized immunoreactive products by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals that two high molecular weight corticotropin species (Mr congruent to 32,500 and 28,000) are synthesized in an approximate 2:1 ratio. Neither product contains carbohydrate based upon concanavalin A chromatography or exposure to polysaccharidases. The smaller molecular weight product does not appear to arise from proteolytic processing since both species are synthesized in approximately the same ratio in cell-free reaction mixtures directed by either polysomes or mRNA. These results suggest that AtT-20/D16v cells contain two distinct mRNA poluations specifying the synthesis of two different high molecular weight forms of mouse corticotropin."
https://openalex.org/W1557958120,"When isolated mitochondria which have been labeled with [3H]leucine are solubilized and treated with anti-serum specific for cytochrome c oxidase, labeled polypeptides which correspond to the three largest polypeptides of this enzyme are immunoprecipitated. This indicates that the three largest polypeptides of cytochrome c oxidase which have Mr of 66,000, 39,000, and 23,000 are synthesized by isolated mitochondria whereas the three smallest ones which have Mr of 14,000, 12,500, and 10,000 are not. The smallest polypeptides are probably synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes as has been demonstrated in other systems by in vivo studies. These results are the first demonstration that isolated mammalian mitochondria are capable of synthesizing some of their own polypeptide components. The antiserum used in this study was prepared to highly purified cytochrome c oxidase (12.4 nmol of heme a + a3/mg of protein) from rat liver mitochondria. This antiserum gives a single precipitin line when tested by the Ouchterlony double diffusion technique. Its specificity has been demonstrated by the fact that it: 1) only precipitates heme a + a3, not hemes b, c, or c1, when added to solubilized mitochondria, 2) inhibits cytochrome c oxidase activity at least 85%, and 3) precipitates only those polypeptides found in purified cytochrome c oxidase when added to solubilized mitochondria labeled in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1490945397,"To determine the structure needed for the biologic activity of human placental lactogen (hPL), we have cleaved hPL with the proteolytic enzyme plasmin. Plasmin modified hPL (PL-hPL) was purified by gel chromatography. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before and after reduction showed that cleavage had occurred within the Cys53-Cys165 loop and tryptic peptide maps revealed that a single peptide consisting of residues 135 to 140 had been removed. 5-Dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl end group analysis and digestion with carboxypeptidase B confirmed that cleavage was complete and only the single hexapeptide was removed. In a membrane binding assay for lactogenic activity PL-hPL was 2- to 3-fold more potent than hPL. Using growth hormone receptors from rabbit liver membranes, PL-hPL was also more potent than hPL, but still much less potent than growth hormone. The lactogenic activity of PL-hPL in an in vitro bioassay was 75% above that of unmodified hormone. It is concluded that plasmin cleaves homologous peptides from hPL and growth hormone and that removal of the hexapeptide from hPL results in enhanced biologic activity."
