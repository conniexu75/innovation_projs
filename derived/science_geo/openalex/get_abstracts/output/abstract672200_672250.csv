https://openalex.org/W3142226569,"Measuring the dynamics of neural processing across time scales requires following the spiking of thousands of individual neurons over milliseconds and months. To address this need, we introduce the Neuropixels 2.0 probe together with newly designed analysis algorithms. The probe has more than 5000 sites and is miniaturized to facilitate chronic implants in small mammals and recording during unrestrained behavior. High-quality recordings over long time scales were reliably obtained in mice and rats in six laboratories. Improved site density and arrangement combined with newly created data processing methods enable automatic post hoc correction for brain movements, allowing recording from the same neurons for more than 2 months. These probes and algorithms enable stable recordings from thousands of sites during free behavior, even in small animals such as mice."

Pompili et al. present a three-node remote quantum network based on solid-state spin qubits (nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond) coupled by photons. The implementation of two quantum protocols on the network. entanglement distribution and entanglement swapping, illustrates a key platform for exploring, testing, and developing multinode quantum networks and quantum protocols.

https://openalex.org/W3163903440,"Strongly interacting electrons in solid-state systems often display tendency towards multiple broken symmetries in the ground state. The complex interplay between different order parameters can give rise to a rich phase diagram. Here, we report on the identification of intertwined phases with broken rotational symmetry in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Using transverse resistance measurements, we find a strongly anisotropic phase located in a 'wedge' above the underdoped region of the superconducting dome. Upon crossing the superconducting dome, a reduction of the critical temperature is observed, similar to the behavior of certain cuprate superconductors. Furthermore, the superconducting state exhibits a anisotropic response to an directional-dependent in-plane magnetic field, revealing a nematic pairing state across the entire superconducting dome. These results indicate that nematic fluctuations might play an important role in the low-temperature phases of magic-angle TBG, and pave the way for using highly-tunable moir\'{e} superlattices to investigate intertwined phases in quantum materials."
https://openalex.org/W3154431974,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor for which current immunotherapy approaches have been unsuccessful. Here, we explore the mechanisms underlying immune evasion in GBM. By serially transplanting GBM stem cells (GSCs) into immunocompetent hosts, we uncover an acquired capability of GSCs to escape immune clearance by establishing an enhanced immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, this is not elicited via genetic selection of tumor subclones, but through an epigenetic immunoediting process wherein stable transcriptional and epigenetic changes in GSCs are enforced following immune attack. These changes launch a myeloid-affiliated transcriptional program, which leads to increased recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages. Furthermore, we identify similar epigenetic and transcriptional signatures in human mesenchymal subtype GSCs. We conclude that epigenetic immunoediting may drive an acquired immune evasion program in the most aggressive mesenchymal GBM subtype by reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment."

Intestinal goblet cells are assumed to be a homogeneous cell type. In this study, however, we delineated their specific gene and protein expression profiles and identified several distinct goblet cell populations that form two differentiation trajectories. One distinct subtype, the intercrypt goblet cells (icGCs), located at the colonic luminal surface, produced mucus with properties that differed from the mucus secreted by crypt-residing goblet cells. Mice with defective icGCs had increased sensitivity to chemically induced colitis and manifested spontaneous colitis with age. Furthermore, alterations in mucus and reduced numbers of icGCs were observed in patients with both active and remissive ulcerative colitis, which highlights the importance of icGCs in maintaining functional protection of the epithelium."

Hafnia-oxide is a ferroelectric material, but whether the polarization switching comes from the polar crystal phases or the migration of oxygen vacancies has remained an open question. Nukala et al. attempted to resolve this controversy by conducting electron microscopy during the operation of a hafnium zirconium oxide capacitor. The authors found that vacancy migration is intertwined with the ferroelectric switching, which has implications for the use of these materials in a range of microelectronic applications.

https://openalex.org/W3156726833,"The Weyl semimetals [1-6] are three-dimensional (3D) gapless topological phases with Weyl cones in the bulk band, and host massless quasiparticles known as Weyl fermions which were theorized by Hermann Weyl in the last twenties [7]. The lattice theory constrains that Weyl cones must come in pairs, with the minimal number of cones being two. The semimetal with only two Weyl cones is an ideal Weyl semimetal (IWSM) which is the optimal platform to explore broad Weyl physics but hard to engineer in solids. Here, we report the experimental realization of the IWSM band by synthesising for the first time a 3D spin-orbit (SO) coupling for ultracold atoms. Engineering a 3D configuration-tunable optical Raman lattice [8], we realize the Weyl type SO coupling for ultracold quantum gas, with which the IWSM band is achieved with controllability. The topological Weyl points are clearly measured via the virtual slicing imaging technique [8, 9] in equilibrium, and further resolved in the quench dynamics, revealing the key information of the realized IWSM bands. The realization of the IWSM band opens an avenue to investigate various exotic phenomena based on the optimal Weyl semimetal platforms."
https://openalex.org/W3155379073,"Individual neurons in visual cortex provide the brain with unreliable estimates of visual features. It is not known whether the single-neuron variability is correlated across large neural populations, thus impairing the global encoding of stimuli. We recorded simultaneously from up to 50,000 neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and in higher order visual areas and measured stimulus discrimination thresholds of 0.35° and 0.37°, respectively, in an orientation decoding task. These neural thresholds were almost 100 times smaller than the behavioral discrimination thresholds reported in mice. This discrepancy could not be explained by stimulus properties or arousal states. Furthermore, behavioral variability during a sensory discrimination task could not be explained by neural variability in V1. Instead, behavior-related neural activity arose dynamically across a network of non-sensory brain areas. These results imply that perceptual discrimination in mice is limited by downstream decoders, not by neural noise in sensory representations."
https://openalex.org/W3152826503,"The value of dirty DNA Environmental DNA can identify the presence of species, even from the distant past. Surveying three cave sites in western Europe and southern Siberia, Vernot et al. identified nuclear DNA and confirmed that it is from the close relatives of anatomically modern humans—Neanderthal and Denisovan individuals. A phylogenetic analysis and modeling show that the DNA in sediment samples from several layers corresponds to previously studied skeletal remains. These results demonstrate that environmental data can be applied to study the population genetics of the extinct Neanderthal and Denisovan lineages, identifying a turnover of Neanderthal populations ∼100,000 years ago.

https://openalex.org/W3155304180,"Obesity is a global epidemic that causes morbidity and impaired quality of life. The melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) is at the crux of appetite, energy homeostasis, and body-weight control in the central nervous system and is a prime target for anti-obesity drugs. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human MC4R-Gs signaling complex bound to the agonist setmelanotide, a cyclic peptide recently approved for the treatment of obesity. The work reveals the mechanism of MC4R activation, highlighting a molecular switch that initiates satiation signaling. In addition, our findings indicate that calcium (Ca2+) is required for agonist, but not antagonist, efficacy. These results fill a gap in the understanding of MC4R activation and could guide the design of future weight-management drugs."

Aiming to expand treatment opportunities, recent studies have begun to explore the utility of tumor transcriptome to guide patient treatment. Here, we introduce SELECT (synthetic lethality and rescue-mediated precision oncology via the transcriptome), a precision oncology framework harnessing genetic interactions to predict patient response to cancer therapy from the tumor transcriptome. SELECT is tested on a broad collection of 35 published targeted and immunotherapy clinical trials from 10 different cancer types. It is predictive of patients' response in 80% of these clinical trials and in the recent multi-arm WINTHER trial. The predictive signatures and the code are made publicly available for academic use, laying a basis for future prospective clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W3154864724,"Move aside, aluminum Some of the most promising schemes for quantum information processing involve superconductors. In addition to the established superconducting qubits, topological qubits may one day be realized in semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures. The superconductor most widely used in this context is aluminum, in which processes that cause decoherence are suppressed. Pendharkar et al. go beyond this paradigm to show that superconducting tin can be used in place of aluminum (see the Perspective by Fatemi and Devoret). The authors grew nanowires of indium antimonide, which is a semiconductor, and coated them with a thin layer of tin without using cumbersome epitaxial growth techniques. This process creates a well-defined, “hard” superconducting gap in the nanowires, which is a prerequisite for using them as the basis for a potential topological qubit.

https://openalex.org/W3154601095,"Protocadherin-19 (PCDH19) mutations cause early-onset seizures and cognitive impairment. The PCDH19 gene is on the X-chromosome. Unlike most X-linked disorders, PCDH19 mutations affect heterozygous females (PCDH19HET♀ ) but not hemizygous males (PCDH19HEMI♂ ); however, the reason why remains to be elucidated. We demonstrate that PCDH19, a cell-adhesion molecule, is enriched at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. Pcdh19HET♀ but not Pcdh19HEMI♂ mice show impaired mossy fiber synaptic structure and physiology. Consistently, Pcdh19HET♀ but not Pcdh19HEMI♂ mice exhibit reduced pattern completion and separation abilities, which require mossy fiber synaptic function. Furthermore, PCDH19 appears to interact with N-cadherin at mossy fiber synapses. In Pcdh19HET♀ conditions, mismatch between PCDH19 and N-cadherin diminishes N-cadherin-dependent signaling and impairs mossy fiber synapse development; N-cadherin overexpression rescues Pcdh19HET♀ phenotypes. These results reveal previously unknown molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the female-specific PCDH19 disorder phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W3155825640,"Background Acute augmentation of stress and disruption of training, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, may impact resident wellbeing. Objectives We investigated how residents in various specialties in the United States were impacted by COVID-19 on mental wellbeing and resilience levels, and the methodology for coping with the stress incurred. Methods In April 2020, the authors electronically surveyed 200 residency programs of all specialties nationally. The survey utilized two validated questionnaires to assess wellbeing and resilience, while investigating demographics and coping mechanisms. The authors used student t-test and ANOVA to quantitatively analyze the data. Results The sample consisted of 1115 respondents (with an 18% response rate). Male gender &amp; Age &gt;39 years were associated with more favorable average well-being indices (both p&lt;0.01). Regarding resources, institutional support (IS) appeared favorable for resident well-being (IS 2.74, SD1.96 vs NoIS 3.71, SD2.29, p&lt;0.01) &amp; resilience (IS 3.72, SD0.70 vs NoIS 3.53, SD0.73, p = 0.05). The effects of mindfulness practices (MP) were not statistically significant for improvement of wellness (MP 2.87, SD 1.99 vs No MP 2.76, SD 2.15, p = 0.85) or resilience (MP 3.71, SD 0.70 vs No MP 3.72, SD 0.68, p = 0.87). Conclusions Findings highlight the critical importance of resident mental status in cases of augmented stress situations. Institutional support may contribute to promotion of resident wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W3154517924,"It is already known that the process of photosynthesis depends on the quality and intensity of light. However, the influence of the new light sources recently used in horticulture, known as Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), on this process is not yet fully understood. Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurement has been widely used as a rapid, reliable, and noninvasive tool to study the efficiency of the photosystem II (PSII) and to evaluate plant responses to various environmental factors, including light intensity and quality. In this work, we tested the responses of the tomato photosynthetic apparatus to different light spectral qualities. Our results showed that the best performance of the photosynthetic apparatus was observed under a mixture of red and blue light (R7:B3) or a mixture of red, green and blue light (R3:G2:B5). This was demonstrated by the increase in the effective photochemical quantum yield of PSII (Y[II]), photochemical quenching (qP) and electron transport rate (ETR). On the other hand, the mixture of red and blue light with a high proportion of blue light led to an increase in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Our results can be used to improve the production of tomato plants under artificial light conditions. However, since we found that the responses of the photosynthetic apparatus of tomato plants to a particular light regime were cultivar-dependent and there was a weak correlation between the growth and photosynthetic parameters tested in this work, special attention should be paid in future research."

https://openalex.org/W3153497124,"Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is a predominantly nuclear RNA-binding protein with key functions in RNA processing and DNA damage repair. Defects in nuclear import of FUS have been linked to severe neurodegenerative diseases; hence, it is of great interest to understand this process and how it is dysregulated in disease. Transportin-1 (TNPO1) and the closely related transportin-2 have been identified as major nuclear import receptors of FUS. They bind to the C-terminal nuclear localization signal of FUS and mediate the protein's nuclear import and at the same time also suppress aberrant phase transitions of FUS in the cytoplasm. Whether FUS can utilize other nuclear transport receptors for the purpose of import and chaperoning has not been examined so far. Here, we show that FUS directly binds to different import receptors in vitro. FUS formed stable complexes not only with TNPO1 but also with transportin-3, importin β, importin 7, or the importin β/7 heterodimer. Binding of these alternative import receptors required arginine residues within FUS-RG/RGG motifs and was weakened by arginine methylation. Interaction with these importins suppressed FUS phase separation and reduced its sequestration into stress granules. In a permeabilized cell system, we further showed that transportin-3 had the capacity to import FUS into the nucleus, albeit with lower efficiency than TNPO1. Our data suggest that aggregation-prone RNA-binding proteins such as FUS may utilize a network of importins for chaperoning and import, similar to histones and ribosomal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3156734176,"Tobacco use is a serious public health concern as it causes various deleterious health problems. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of tobacco use and various types of tobacco used among a population-based sample of adults 18 years and above in Qatar (residents and expatriates). The study also attempted to assess tobacco use initiation age, tobacco dependency, and to identify factors associated with current tobacco use. This 2019 cross-sectional study was conducted among governmental employees and University students in Qatar using cluster sampling methodology. Study participants completed a self-administered, country-adapted summarized version of the Global Adult Tobacco Survey. 25.2% (n = 1741; N = 6904) of the surveyed sample reported current tobacco use. 21.5% (n = 1481) smoked tobacco (cigarettes, waterpipe, medwakh and cigar) concomitant with other forms of tobacco and only 1.0% (n = 69) were using other forms of tobacco (electronic cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and heat-not-burn tobacco products) and 2.7% (n = 191) did not mention the type of tobacco products used by them. Of the 1550 tobacco users, 42.8% were cigarette smokers, 20.9% waterpipe, 3.2% medwakh (Arabic traditional pipe) and 0.7% cigar. Moreover, 1.9% reported smokeless tobacco use ( sweika ), 2.0% electronic cigarette use, and 0.3% heat-not-burn tobacco use. The mean age for smoking initiation was 19.7±5.3 (Qataris 18.6±4.8 and non-Qataris 20.3±5.6). Using multivariable logistic regression, significant association was observed between tobacco use and gender, nationality, age, monthly income, living with a smoker, and self-rated health. This large population-based cross-sectional survey provides the first evidence for the prevalence of different types of tobacco use including medwakh smoking among adults (Qataris and non-Qataris) 18 years and above in Qatar. This can serve as a baseline for future research studies on the topic. Based on the review of previous and current tobacco survey findings, it is evident that the prevalence of tobacco use (current) in Qatar has declined suggesting that tobacco control measures implemented by the country have been effective in reducing tobacco consumption."
https://openalex.org/W3152713889,"In 2017–2018, a group of international development funding agencies launched the Crops to End Hunger initiative to modernize public plant breeding in lower-income countries. To inform that initiative, USAID asked the International Food Policy Research Institute and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service to estimate the impacts of faster productivity growth for 20 food crops on income and other indicators in 106 countries in developing regions in 2030. We first estimated the value of production in 2015 for each crop using data from FAO. We then used the IMPACT and GLOBE economic models to estimate changes in the value of production and changes in economy-wide income under scenarios of faster crop productivity growth, assuming that increased investment will raise annual rates of yield growth by 25% above baseline growth rates over the period 2015–2030. We found that faster productivity growth in rice, wheat and maize increased economy-wide income in the selected countries in 2030 by 59 billion USD, 27 billion USD and 21 billion USD respectively, followed by banana and yams with increases of 9 billion USD each. While these amounts represent small shares of total GDP, they are 2–15 times current public R&amp;D spending on food crops in developing countries. Income increased most in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Faster productivity growth in rice and wheat reduced the population at risk of hunger by 11 million people and 6 million people respectively, followed by plantain and cassava with reductions of about 2 million people each. Changes in adequacy ratios were relatively large for carbohydrates (already in surplus) and relatively small for micronutrients. In general, we found that impacts of faster productivity growth vary widely across crops, regions and outcome indicators, highlighting the importance of identifying the potentially diverse objectives of different decision makers and recognizing possible tradeoffs between objectives."
https://openalex.org/W3155994967,"Introduction Several serum inflammatory markers are associated with poor clinical outcomes in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, the prognosis and early treatment response in hospitalized CAP patients based on serial neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) measurement has never been investigated. Methods We performed a retrospective observational study for 175 consecutive patients hospitalized with CAP between February 2016 and February 2018. NLR, C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin levels were measured on admission day (D1) and on hospital day 4 (D4). The Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) was also assessed on admission. The primary endpoint was all-cause death within 30 days after admission. The secondary endpoint was early treatment response such as intensive care unit (ICU) admission during hospitalization and clinical unstability on day 4. Results The 30-day mortality rate was 9.7%. In multivariate analysis, NLR D4 (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.04–1.18; P = 0.003) and its incremental change (NLR D4/D1 &gt;1) (OR: 7.10; 95% CI: 2.19–23.06; P = 0.001) were significant predictors of 30-day mortality. NLR D4 and its incremental change were significant predictors of ICU admission and clinical unstability on day 4 in multivariate analyses. Adding of incremental NLR change significantly improved the prognostic ability of the PSI. The additive value of incremental NLR change for the prognostic ability of the PSI was larger than that of incremental CRP change. Conclusion Serial NLR measurement represents useful laboratory tool to predict the prognosis and early treatment response of hospitalized CAP patients."
https://openalex.org/W3154832597,"Background Cervical cancer imposes considerable economic burden on societies and individuals. There is lack of evidence regarding this from the developing world and particularly from sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the study aimed to estimate the societal costs of cervical cancer in Eswatini. Materials and methods The cost of illness study (CoI) was applied using national specific clinical and registry data from hospitals, registries and reports to determine the prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer in Eswatini in 2018. Cost data included direct medical costs (health care utilization in inpatient and outpatient care), direct non-medical costs (patient costs for traveling) and indirect costs based on productivity loss due to morbidity (patient time during diagnosis and treatment) and premature mortality. Results The estimated total annual cost for cervical cancer was $19 million (ranging between $14 million and $24 million estimated with lower and upper bounds). Direct cost represented the majority of the costs at 72% ($13.7 million) out of which total pre-cancerous treatment costs accounted for 0.7% ($94,161). The management of invasive cervical cancer was the main cost driver with costs attributable to treatment for FIGO III and FIGO IV representing $1.7 million and $8.7 million respectively. Indirect costs contributed 27% ($5.3 million) out of which productivity loss due to premature mortality represented the majority at 67% ($3.5 million). Conclusion The economic burden of cervical cancer in Eswatini is substantial. National public health prevention strategies with prophylactic HPV vaccine and screening for cervical lesions should therefore be prioritized to limit the extensive costs associated with cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3156010961,"After a decade of civil war and the 2014–2016 West African Ebola outbreak, Sierra Leone now faces the COVID-19 pandemic with a fragile health system. As was demonstrated during Ebola, preparedness is key to limiting a health crisis’ spread and impact on health systems and ensuring continued care for vulnerable populations including people living with HIV (PLHIV). To assess COVID-19 preparedness and inform interventions to ensure continuity of HIV services at health facilities (HFs) and community service points (CSPs), we conducted site readiness assessments in Freetown, the epicenter of COVID-19 in Sierra Leone. Data were collected at nine high-volume HIV HFs and seven CSPs in April 2020, a month after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. CSPs comprised three community drop-in centers providing HIV counseling and testing services as well as HIV prevention services (e.g., condoms and lubricants) for key and priority populations and four community-based support groups serving PLHIV. At the time of assessment, CSPs did not provide antiretroviral therapy (ART) but were considered potential sites for expansion of differentiated service delivery (DSD)—a client-centered approach to HIV care—in the context of COVID-19. Overall, 5/9 HFs had trained staff on use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Most had access to masks (5/9) and gloves (7/9) for management of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 4/9 HFs had triage procedures for isolation of suspected cases. Conversely, few CSPs had access to masks (2/7) or gloves (2/7) and no staff were trained on PPE use or COVID-19 transmission. 7/9 HFs had adequate ART stock for multi-month dispensing though few had procedures for (3/9) or had trained staff in providing DSD (2/9). Among CSPs where measures were applicable, 2/4 had procedures for DSD, 1/3 had staff trained on DSD and none had adequate ART stock. Identification of gaps in COVID-19 preparedness is a critical step in providing support for infection control and modified service delivery. Findings from this assessment highlight gaps in COVID-19 preparedness measures at sites supporting PLHIV in Sierra Leone and indicate CSPs may require intensive supervision and training to ensure HIV services are uninterrupted while minimizing COVID-19 risk, especially if used as sites to scale up DSD."

The homo-oligomeric nature of Hfq favors recognition of nucleotide repeats in target RNAs, such as the ARN-triplet repeat motif (where A is an adenine and R and N are a purine and any nucleotide, respectively), which binds on the distal side (Fig. 1B) (13Robinson K.E.

Mapping Hfq-RNA interaction surfaces using tryptophan fluorescence quenching.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 2736-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Hfq was identified as a versatile contributor to metabolic regulation (14Sonnleitner E. Bläsi U. Regulation of Hfq by the RNA CrcZ in Pseudomonas aeruginosa carbon catabolite repression.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10e1004440Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) whose influences on different pathways are facilitated via interactions with other proteins (15Van den Bossche A. Ceyssens P.-J. De Smet J. Hendrix H. Bellon H. Leimer N. Wagemans J. Delattre A.-S. Cenens W. Aertsen A. Landuyt B. Minakhin L. Severinov K. Noben J.-P. Lavigne R. Systematic identification of hypothetical bacteriophage proteins targeting key protein complexes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Proteome Res. 2014; 13: 4446-4456Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One such partner is the catabolite repression control (Crc) protein (16Milojevic T. Grishkovskaya I. Sonnleitner E. Djinovic-Carugo K. Bläsi U. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa catabolite repression control protein Crc is devoid of RNA binding activity.PLoS One. 2013; 8e64609Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In Pseudomonas, Crc is responsible for directing the metabolic pathways toward preferring succinate over other potential carbon sources (17Wolff J.A. MacGregor C.H. Eisenberg R.C. Phibbs P.V. Isolation and characterization of catabolite repression control mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO.J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4700-4706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of Hfq and Crc cooperation involves binding of both proteins to ARN repeats in the 5′-untranslated region of target mRNAs, thus repressing expression of enzymes involved in alternative metabolic pathways (14Sonnleitner E. Bläsi U. Regulation of Hfq by the RNA CrcZ in Pseudomonas aeruginosa carbon catabolite repression.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10e1004440Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). When succinate is depleted, the sRNA CrcZ is expressed (18Sonnleitner E. Abdou L. Haas D. Small RNA as global regulator of carbon catabolite repression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 21866-21871Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and proceeds to sequester Hfq and Crc from their mRNA targets, allowing the mRNAs of alternative metabolic genes, such as the amiE, to be translated (6Sonnleitner E. Wulf A. Campagne S. Pei X.-Y. Wolfinger M.T. Forlani G. Prindl K. Abdou L. Resch A. Allain F.H.-T. Luisi B.F. Urlaub H. Bläsi U. Interplay between the catabolite repression control protein Crc, Hfq and RNA in Hfq-dependent translational regulation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 1470-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Crc has no intrinsic RNA-binding or Hfq-binding capabilities of its own (16Milojevic T. Grishkovskaya I. Sonnleitner E. Djinovic-Carugo K. Bläsi U. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa catabolite repression control protein Crc is devoid of RNA binding activity.PLoS One. 2013; 8e64609Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), yet it can bind to Hfq–RNA complexes and strengthen Hfq interactions with target RNAs (14Sonnleitner E. Bläsi U. Regulation of Hfq by the RNA CrcZ in Pseudomonas aeruginosa carbon catabolite repression.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10e1004440Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The structural basis of this cooperative action has been unraveled by cryo-EM, which showed Hfq, Crc, and a short segment of amiE mRNA forming a quaternary complex (19Pei X.Y. Dendooven T. Sonnleitner E. Chen S. Bläsi U. Luisi B.F. Architectural principles for Hfq/Crc-mediated regulation of gene expression.Elife. 2019; 8e43158Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The structure of this complex encompasses two Hfq hexamers, each complexed with an RNA octadecamer containing six ARN repeats, the amiE6ARN fragment. At a minimum, there is a homodimer of two Crc proteins positioned between the two Hfq–RNA complexes. We henceforth refer to this structure as the quaternary complex (Fig. 1C). Depending on availability, up to two additional Crc proteins can be recruited into the quaternary complex (19Pei X.Y. Dendooven T. Sonnleitner E. Chen S. Bläsi U. Luisi B.F. Architectural principles for Hfq/Crc-mediated regulation of gene expression.Elife. 2019; 8e43158Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The cryo-EM structures of the quaternary complex reveal a recognition motif seen in earlier X-ray structures of Hfq complexed with polyadenine RNAs (8Link T.M. Valentin-Hansen P. Brennan R.G.

Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the crystal structures, the A and R nucleotides of ARN repeats are specifically bound by the Hfq, whereas the N nucleotides are bulged away from Hfq and interact with the neighboring crystallographic cells. The same RNA recognition pattern is present in the quaternary complex except that the N nucleotides are instead engaged in nonspecific interactions with the Crc proteins (19Pei X.Y. Dendooven T.

In this study, we used atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the conformational variation of the Hfq–RNA binary complex and the higher order quaternary complexes formed with Crc.

Although simulation timescales are generally short, well-executed simulations can provide insights into biomolecular dynamics that are not apparent from static models obtained by structural experiments, for which the data are typically time- and ensemble-averaged (23Campagne S. Krepl M. Sponer J. Allain F.H.T. Chapter fourteen - combining NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamic simulations to solve and analyze the structure of protein–RNA complexes.in: Wand A.J.

RuvC uses dynamic probing of the holliday junction to achieve sequence specificity and efficient resolution.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10e4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Biomolecular dynamics can be invaluable for understanding the nature of complex intramolecular interfaces, such as those of protein–RNA complexes, where it underpins binding affinities, specificities, and formation rates. The interface dynamics between biomolecules can involve competing local conformational substates rather than a fixed geometry (30Ripin N. Boudet J. Duszczyk M.M. Hinniger A. Faller M. Krepl M. Gadi A. Schneider R.J. Šponer J. Meisner-Kober N.C. Allain F.H.-T. Molecular basis for AU-rich element recognition and dimerization by the HuR C-terminal RRM.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 2935-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), resulting in dynamic recognition. The substates associated with the dynamical ensemble may be important for the detailed mechanisms of the process of binding and unbinding (31Borkar A.N. Bardaro M.F. Camilloni C. Aprile F.A. Varani G. Vendruscolo M. Structure of a low-population binding intermediate in protein-RNA recognition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: 7171-7176Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Dynamic recognition can be biologically significant as it could facilitate highly specific recognition of RNAs by a protein and would provide a mechanism by which a large pool of cellular RNAs can be interrogated with speed, specificity, and high affinity for target sequences. Different interaction intermediates can be preferred by different binding partners in quaternary complexes. We propose that Hfq must utilize a form of dynamic recognition because its in vivo RNA cycling at both proximal and distal sides was shown to be disproportionally fast relative to its low-nanomolar RNA-binding affinity, as measured by in vitro experiments (32Fender A. Elf J. Hampel K. Zimmermann B. Wagner E.G.H. RNAs actively cycle on the Sm-like protein Hfq.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2621-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 33Wagner E.G.H. Cycling of RNAs on Hfq.RNA Biol. 2013; 10: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that extensive equilibrium local dynamics indeed occur at the distal side interface of the Hfq–RNA complex and offer a concrete example of a conformational switch that can influence rates of translocation along a length of RNA. Namely, the first nucleotide in each ARN repeat (i.e., the adenines) can undergo frequent syn/anti flips, before Crc binding. The anti and syn conformations are supported by Hfq via unique adenine-specific interactions in both positions. The frequency of the flips is lowered upon formation of the quaternary complex, that is, after Crc is bound, and the syn conformation becomes less favored. We also identify a previously unknown binding pocket at the distal side of Hfq which can weakly bind the N nucleotides of the ARN repeats in the absence of Crc. Finally, we suggest a potential assembly pathway in which the Crc initially recognizes an intramolecular RNA interaction in the amiE6ARN. The simulations of Hfq–RNA and quaternary complexes showed no loss of structural compactness and integrity, which indicates good performance of the force field (21Šponer J. Bussi G. Krepl M. Banáš P. Bottaro S. Cunha R.A. Gil-Ley A. Pinamonti G. Poblete S. Jurečka P. Walter N.G. Otyepka M. RNA structural dynamics as captured by molecular simulations: A comprehensive overview.Chem.

Architectural principles for Hfq/Crc-mediated regulation of gene expression.Elife. 2019; 8e43158Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) used as the starting states for the simulations. For such large systems, we did not expect to achieve a full thermodynamic convergence within affordable computational time (34Krepl M. Havrila M. Stadlbauer P. Banas P. Otyepka M. Pasulka J. Stefl R. Sponer J. Can we execute stable microsecond-scale atomistic simulations of protein-RNA complexes?.J. Chem. Theor. Comput. 2015; 11: 1220-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In fact, such convergence is not fully achieved even in longer MD simulations of much smaller systems such as RNA tetraloops and tetranucleotides (35Bergonzo C. Henriksen N.M. Roe D.R. Cheatham T.E. Highly sampled tetranucleotide and tetraloop motifs enable evaluation of common RNA force fields.RNA. 2015; 21: 1578-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, even without achieving full quantitative convergence, the MD simulations can provide a wealth of information about the RNA systems (21Šponer J. Bussi G. Krepl M. Banáš P. Bottaro S.

The simulations presented here can be considered qualitatively converged in a sense that the same simulation trends were observed in multiple independent parallel trajectories of the individual systems (Table 1). In addition, we extended selected simulations up to 5, 10, or 15 μs (Table 1), observing the same trends even on these longer timescales. The analyses presented in the main text are based mainly on these extended trajectories.

Open table in a new tab Crc, catabolite repression control; PDB, Protein Data Bank. The bound RNA in the quaternary complex consists of six ARN trinucleotide repeats while the Hfq itself is a hexamer (Fig. 1B). All ARN motif nucleotides in the positions “A” (includes A1, A4, A7, A10, A13, and A16) and “R” (includes A2, A5, A8, A11, A14, and G17), respectively, are bound in identically organized binding pockets, and their positions are clearly defined by H-bonds, base stacking, and van der Waals (vdW) interactions (Fig. 2A). The pockets exhibited highly similar behavior in simulations, and their protein–RNA interactions were all maintained with only reversible fluctuations (Tables S1 and S2). To simplify descriptions, we will collectively refer to the first and second nucleotides of the repeats as either AA or AR/GR, with the lower index signifying the nucleotide’s position within the ARN repeat. For example, notation Q33(N)–AA(N7) describes backbone amide nitrogen of residues Q33 in the individual Hfq chains forming H-bonds with N7 of RNA nucleotides A1, A4, A7, A10, A13, or A16. Wherever the behavior significantly differed among the repeats, we refer directly to the specific nucleotides by their residue numbering (Fig. 1). To help distinguish Crc amino acids, they are labeled with an accent (e.g., R162′). The most significant conformational change observed in the simulations of Hfq–RNA complexes, in absence of Crc, was the dynamic equilibrium between anti and syn conformations of the AA nucleobases. Most strikingly, the anti-AA and syn-AA nucleotides established interactions with the same amino acids. Structurally, this was possible by the N7 atom replacing the N1 atom as the H-bond acceptor and vice versa, whereas the second hydrogen of the N6 amino group was utilized as a H-bond donor (Fig. 2). There is also a single water bridge between AA and AR, which is formed solely with AA in anti (Fig. 3B). This water bridge is present in the X-ray structure of poly-A RNA bound to Hfq (8Link T.M. Valentin-Hansen P. Brennan R.G. Structure of Escherichia coli Hfq bound to polyriboadenylate RNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 19292-19297Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and was regularly observed in all our MD simulations as long as AA was in anti while being abolished in syn. Finally, there is a close presumable repulsive atomic contact between O4′ atom of AA ribose and the backbone carbonyl of K31 associated with the anti conformation of AA (Fig. 3B). In MD simulations, the K31(O)-AA(O4′) distance increased when AA flipped into syn, thus relieving the repulsion. The average simulation time between the flips differed significantly among the individual simulations and AA nucleotides, ranging from tens to hundreds of nanoseconds (Fig. 3; Fig. S2). The transition intermediate of these flips (Fig. 2B) was stabilized by a temporary formation of an intranucleotide H-bond, and the transition time of the flips was in the range of tens of picoseconds. In each simulation, several back-and-forth syn/anti flips were ob"
https://openalex.org/W3153310212,"Background Attainment of healthcare in respectful and dignified manner is a fundamental right for every woman regardless of the individual status. However, social exclusion, poor psychosocial support, and demeaning care during childbirth at health facilities are common worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We concurrently examined how women with varying socio-demographic characteristics are treated during childbirth, the effect of women’s empowerment on mistreatment, and health services factors that contribute to mistreatment in secondary-level public health facilities in Pakistan. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted during August–November 2016 among 783 women who gave birth in six secondary-care public health facilities across four contiguous districts of southern Sindh. Women were recruited in health facilities and later interviewed at home within 42 days of postpartum using a WHO’s framework-guided 43-item structured questionnaire. Means, standard deviation, and average were used to describe characteristics of the participants. Multivariable linear regression was applied using Stata 15.1. Results Women experiencing at least one violation of their right to care by hospital staff during intrapartum care included: ineffective communication (100%); lack of supportive care (99.7%); loss of autonomy (97.5%); failure of meeting professional clinical standards (84.4%); lack of resources (76.3%); verbal abuse (15.2%); physical abuse (14.8%); and discrimination (3.2%). Risk factors of all three dimensions showed significant association with mistreatment: socio-demographic: primigravida and poorer were more mistreated; health services: lesser-education on birth preparedness and postnatal care leads to higher mistreatment; and in terms of women’s empowerment: women who were emotionally and physically abused by family, and those with lack of social support and lesser involvement in joint household decision making with husbands are more likely to be mistreated as compared to their counterparts. The magnitude of relationship between all significant risk factors and mistreatment, in the form of β coefficients, ranged from 0.2 to 5.5 with p-values less than 0.05. Conclusion There are glaring inequalities in terms of the way women are treated during childbirth in public health facilities. Measures of socio-demographic, health services, and women’s empowerment showed a significant independent association with mistreatment during childbirth. At the health system level, there is a need for urgent solutions for more inclusive care to ensure that all women are treated with compassion and dignity, complemented by psychosocial support for those who are emotionally disturbed and lack social support."
https://openalex.org/W3154462561,"Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are important for pollutant removal from wastewater, elimination of point discharges of nutrients into the environment and water resource protection. The anaerobic/anoxic/oxic (A2/O) process is widely used in WWTPs for nitrogen removal, but the requirement for additional organics to ensure a suitable nitrogen removal efficiency makes this process costly and energy consuming. In this study, we report mixotrophic denitrification at a low COD (chemical oxygen demand)/TN (total nitrogen) ratio in a full-scale A2/O WWTP with relatively high sulfate in the inlet. Nitrogen and sulfur species analysis in different units of this A2/O WWTP showed that the internal sulfur cycle of sulfate reduction and reoxidation occurred and that the reduced sulfur species might contribute to denitrification. Microbial community analysis revealed that Thiobacillus , an autotrophic sulfur-oxidizing denitrifier, dominated the activated sludge bacterial community. Metagenomics data also supported the potential of sulfur-based denitrification when high levels of denitrification occurred, and sulfur oxidation and sulfate reduction genes coexisted in the activated sludge. Although most of the denitrification genes were affiliated with heterotrophic denitrifiers with high abundance, the narG and napA genes were mainly associated with autotrophic sulfur-oxidizing denitrifiers. The functional genes related to nitrogen removal were actively expressed even in the unit containing relatively highly reduced sulfur species, indicating that the mixotrophic denitrification process in A2/O could overcome not only a shortage of carbon sources but also the inhibition by reduced sulfur of nitrification and denitrification. Our results indicate that a mixotrophic denitrification process could be developed in full-scale WWTPs and reduce the requirement for additional carbon sources, which could endow WWTPs with more flexible and adaptable nitrogen removal."
https://openalex.org/W3155725654,"Background Acne is a common skin disease that can affect a person’s quality of life (QoL), self-esteem, and mood in an adverse manner. The aim of the current study was to assess QoL among Montenegrin pupils with acne. Methods This cross-sectional survey was conducted over October and November 2020 in four randomly selected secondary schools in Podgorica, Montenegro. All 500 pupils were asked to fill in a short questionnaire which included questions on age, sex, presence of acne, and for those with acne their duration and location, visits to doctors, presence of any other coexisting skin disease, and family history of acne. Only pupils who self-reported acne were asked to complete the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) and the Cardiff Acne Disability Index (CADI). Results Self reported acne were presented in 49.8% (249/500) of all pupils. The mean CDLQI score of the total sample was 4.27 ± 5.13. Overall, the CDLQI domains that were most affected by acne were symptoms and feelings (mean score 1.49 ± 1.43), leisure (mean score 0.94 ± 1.72), and treatment (0.66 ± 0.79). The mean total CADI score was 3.53 ± 3.11 which was higher in girls (4.07 ± 3.11) than in boys (2.90 ± 3.00). There was good correlation between the two questionnaires (Rho = 0.76; P &lt; 0.01). According to multiple linear regressions, higher overall CDLQI score was found in pupils with acne who reported other skin diseases, while girls, pupils who reported both acne on face and back, and who had any concomitant skin disease had higher CADI total score. Conclusions Acne affects QoL of young adolescents in Montenegro with greater impact in girls. Our findings should point out the importance of timely diagnosis, treatment, and education of adolescents with acne."

Mobile phone surveys (MPS) offer the opportunity to collect real-time data on behavior, exposure, knowledge, and perception, as well as care and treatment to inform decision making. The surveys aimed to collect coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related information in Ecuador and Sri Lanka using mobile phones. In Ecuador, a Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) survey was conducted. In Sri Lanka, an evaluation of a novel medicine delivery system was conducted. Using the established mobile network operator channels and technical assistance provided through The Bloomberg Philanthropies Data for Health Initiative (D4H), Ministries of Health fielded a population-based COVID-19-specific MPS using Surveda, the open source data collection tool developed as part of the initiative. A total of 1,185 adults in Ecuador completed the MPS in 14 days. A total of 5,001 adults over the age of 35 in Sri Lanka completed the MPS in 44 days. Both samples were adjusted to the 2019 United Nations Population Estimates to produce population-based estimates by age and sex. The Ecuador COVID-19 MPS found that there was compliance with the mitigation strategies implemented in that country. Overall, 96.5% of Ecuadorians reported wearing a face mask or face covering when leaving home. Overall, 3.8% of Sri Lankans used the service to receive medicines from a government clinic. Among those who used the medicine delivery service in Sri Lanka, 95.8% of those who used a private pharmacy received their medications within one week, and 69.9% of those using a government clinic reported the same. These studies demonstrate that MPS can be conducted quickly and gather essential data. MPS can help monitor the impact of interventions and programs, and rapidly identify what works in mitigating the impact of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3154134389,"The integrin αvβ6 is an antigen expressed at low levels in healthy tissue but upregulated during tumorigenesis, which makes it a promising target for cancer imaging and therapy. A20FMDV2 is a 20-mer peptide derived from the foot-and-mouth disease virus that exhibits nanomolar and selective affinity for αvβ6 versus other integrins. Despite this selectivity, A20FMDV2 has had limited success in imaging and treating αvβ6+ tumors in vivo because of its poor serum stability. Here, we explore the cyclization and modification of the A20FMDV2 peptide to improve its serum stability without sacrificing its affinity and specificity for αvβ6. Using cysteine amino acid substitutions and cyclization by perfluoroarylation with decafluorobiphenyl, we synthesized six cyclized A20FMDV2 variants and discovered that two retained binding to αvβ6 with modestly improved serum stability. Further d-amino acid substitutions and C-terminal sequence optimization outside the cyclized region greatly prolonged peptide serum stability without reducing binding affinity. While the cyclized A20FMDV2 variants exhibited increased nonspecific integrin binding compared with the original peptide, additional modifications with the non-natural amino acids citrulline, hydroxyproline, and d-alanine were found to restore binding specificity, with some modifications leading to greater αvβ6 integrin selectivity than the original A20FMDV2 peptide. The peptide modifications detailed herein greatly improve the potential of utilizing A20FMDV2 to target αvβ6 in vivo, expanding opportunities for cancer targeting and therapy.

From 2009 through 2015, pancreatic, liver, lung, and esophageal cancers had the lowest survival rates of any cancer and are projected to contribute to 38% of cancer-related deaths in 2020 (1Siegel R.L. Miller K.D. Jemal A. Cancer statistics, 2020.C. A. Cancer J. Clin. 2020; 70: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (7921) Google Scholar). Patients are often asymptomatic at early stages with these cancers, preventing timely diagnosis and thereby limiting effective treatment options at later stages of disease. Consequentially, there is a significant need for targeted diagnostics and therapeutics that could identify and treat these cancers at early stages to improve patient outcomes. Integrins are a family of heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that interact with proteins in the extracellular matrix and on other cells to mediate cell adhesion and migration. While integrins are involved in a variety of healthy biological functions, including embryogenesis, tissue regeneration, and immune cell trafficking (2Huttenlocher A. Horwitz A.R. Integrins in cell migration.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: a005074Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), their aberrant expression and activity can drive cancer initiation and metastasis (3Hamidi H. Ivaska J.

Modification of A20FMDV2 with two short PEG chains (∼1 kDa each) reduces peptide degradation and thereby increases tumor retention but also slows peptide clearance from healthy tissue and increases renal retention (50Hausner S.H.

For these reasons, we sought to engineer an A20FMDV2 peptide with chemistries and amino acid modifications that increase the peptide's inherent metabolic stability. Here, we report the design of cyclized A20FMDV2 variants with selective amino acid modifications and their characterization in vitro. We demonstrate that these peptide variants have prolonged stability in serum and retain their binding affinity for αvβ6+ cells. Importantly, some of these optimized peptides demonstrate improved αvβ6 specificity over the original A20FMDV2 peptide, further increasing the benefit for future in vivo application. A20FMDV2 has a hairpin loop structure with the RGD motif at the tip of hairpin turn followed by a 310 helix (Fig. 1A) (38Logan D. Abu-Ghazaleh R. Blakemore W. Curry S. Jackson T. King A. Lea S.

Accordingly, we postulated that chemistries involving the N- and C-terminal amino-acid positions of the peptide could increase serum stability without negatively affecting peptide binding to αvβ6. Cyclization is a well-established technique for stabilizing peptides and improving their pharmacokinetic profiles (35Vlieghe P. Lisowski V. Martinez J. Khrestchatisky M.

Today. 2010; 15: 40-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar), and cysteine perfluoroarylation is a facile cyclization approach that uses perfluoroaromatic molecular linkers to staple together cysteine thiol moieties on unprotected peptides (53Spokoyny A.M. Zou Y. Ling J.J. Yu H. Lin Y.-S. Pentelute B.L. A perfluoroaryl-cysteine SNAr chemistry approach to unprotected peptide stapling.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013; 135: 5946-5949Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has previously used this technique for peptide cyclization with a decafluorobiphenyl (DFBP) linker (Fig. 1B) and demonstrated increased serum stability and affinity of DFBP-cyclized peptides compared with counterparts with disulfide, amide, or triazole cyclization (54Ngambenjawong C. Pineda J.M.B. Pun S.H. Engineering an affinity-enhanced peptide through optimization of cyclization chemistry.Bioconjug. Chem. 2016; 27: 2854-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 55Sellers D.L. Tan J.-K.Y. Pineda J.M.B. Peeler D.J. Porubsky V.L. Olden B.R. Salipante S.J. Pun S.H. Targeting ligands deliver model drug cargo into the central nervous system along autonomic neurons.ACS Nano. 2019; 13: 10961-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We therefore synthesized six unique A20FMDV2 peptide sequences with cysteine substitutions primarily at N- and C-terminal amino-acid positions for cyclization by DFBP to stabilize and close the hairpin peptide structure (Fig. 1C). Biotin was conjugated on the N terminus of all peptides for labeling with streptavidin-AF647 to assess cell binding by flow cytometry. Peptides were also synthesized with a C-terminal lysine to mimic a prospective methyltrityl-lysine that could be added for selective modification or synthesis of branched peptides at the lysine side chain. The binding of cyclized A20FMDV2 sequences to αvβ6 was evaluated with the matched erythroleukemia K562 and K562 αvβ6:mCherry cell lines. Both cell lines endogenously express the α5β1 integrin (56Hewish M.J. Takada Y. Coulson B.S. Integrins α2β1 and α4β1 can mediate SA11 rotavirus attachment and entry into cells.J. Virol. 2000; 74: 228236Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar), but only the K562 αvβ6:mCherry cells express the αvβ6 integrin. Of the DFBP-cyclized sequences, we observed binding of the C1C18 DFBP (N1C; A18C), C1C20 DFBP (N1C; T20C), and C2C18 DFBP (A2C; A18C) peptides to K562 αvβ6:mCherry cells with high affinity and specificity comparable to the original A20FMDV2 peptide (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, peptide sequences C1C19 DFBP (N1C; R19C) and C2C19 DFBP (A2C; R19C) exhibited not only high binding to K562 αvβ6:mCherry cells but also poor specificity. Both peptides significantly bound to parental K562 cells at high concentrations, suggesting that Arg19 in A20FMDV2 is important for αvβ6 specificity. Similarly, the peptide cyclized via cysteine substitutions proximal to the RGDLXXL motif, C6C17 DFBP (L6C; V17C), displayed minimal binding to K562 αvβ6:mCherry cells. It is known that Val12 and Val17 are important for the structure of the post-RGD helix in A20FMDV2 (57DiCara D. Burman A. Clark S. Berryman S. Howard M.J. Hart I.R. Marshall J.F. Jackson T. Foot-and-Mouth disease virus forms a highly stable, EDTA-resistant complex with its principal receptor, integrin αvβ6: Implications for Infectiousness.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1537-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), so the cysteine substitutions in the C6C17 DFBP peptide and their cyclization likely impaired the 310 helix structure. Given that the DFBP-cyclized C1C18, C1C20, and C2C18 peptides retained the favorable binding properties of the original A20FMDV2 peptide, we moved forward with these variants for characterization of serum stability. As the original A20FMDV2 peptide is degraded by over 50% in normal mouse serum within a 4 h incubation at 37 °C (58Hung K. Harris P.W.R. Desai A. Marshall J.F. Brimble M.A. Structure-activity relationship study of the tumour-targeting peptide A20FMDV2 via modification of Lys16, Leu13, and N- and/or C-terminal functionality.Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2017; 136: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that our DFBP-cyclized variants would have prolonged serum stability because of added structural stability from their cyclization. To investigate this, we incubated the DFBP-cyclized C1C18, C1C20, and C2C18 peptides in normal mouse serum at 37 °C for up to 6 h and measured the presence of intact peptide and any degradation products at different time points by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 2, A–C). As shown, the partially cyclized C1C18 DFBP and C2C18 DFBP peptides formed degradation products that are 385 Da smaller after incubation in serum for 2 h, corresponding C-terminal cleavage of the arginine–threonine–lysine (RTK) group outside the DFBP-cyclized region (Fig. 2, A and C). C1C18 DFBP had prolonged intact peptide presence compared with C2C18 DFBP (6 h versus 2 h), suggesting that the C1C18 cyclization scheme better protects the exocyclic C-terminal RTK group. Importantly, the 385 Da smaller degradation products for both peptides persisted up to the last time point sampled, and no further degradation peaks were observed, demonstrating good protection of amino acids within their cyclized regions. We also assayed a disulfide-cyclized C1C18 peptide (C1C18 S–S) and observed faster degradation to the 385 Da smaller product compared with C1C18 DFBP (Fig. S1), emphasizing the importance of the DFBP molecular linker. To our surprise, the fully cyclized C1C20 DFBP peptide degraded within 2 h in serum; we could not detect any peptide or degradation products at the 4 and 6 h time points (Fig. 2B). We detected a low-intensity 135 smaller Da degradation product at the 2 h time point, but it was near background, and we could not predict the amino acid sequence. The molecular weight difference is near what would be expected from an internal arginine deletion (138 Da smaller), so Arg7 or Arg19 may have been metabolically cleaved from the sequence. These data suggest that the complete cyclization of a peptide from N to C terminus is not always beneficial for stability, and that peptide structure sh"

https://openalex.org/W3155055134,"In tennis, coaches consider balance fundamental for the acquisition of skilled motor performance. However, the potential relationship between balance and tennis expertise and performance has not been explored yet. Therefore, this study assessed the relationship between balance and tennis performance using linear and non-linear parameters through 1) the comparison of tennis players of different ages and levels of expertise, and 2) analyzing the relationship between balance and tennis serving speed and accuracy. One hundred and six recreational and expert male tennis players took part in the study (age range 10–35 years old). Temporal dynamics of postural control during a balance task on an unstable surface were analyzed through the mean velocity and the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA V ) of center of pressure (COP). Tennis serve performance was quantified by measuring accuracy and speed. Traditional variables measuring balance performance only showed differences according to age but not to sport performance. COP showed a reduction of auto-correlated variability (reflected by DFA V ) with age but mainly in expert players. COP dynamics was the only balance parameter discriminating sport expertise and it was related to age. Balance dynamics exhibited by expert tennis players DFA V results support the idea that, along the years, sport experience induces balance adaptations characterized by a higher ability to perform postural adjustments. These results also reinforce the use of non-linear analysis to reveal subtle balance adaptations produced by sport practice. Finally, the lack of correlations suggests that balance, measured with scattering variables, in a non-specific task is not a main determinant of sport performance in tennis serve."

Users should understand the impacts that data representations may have on their results in order to prevent distortions in their outcomes. We study the consequences of two common data preparations when locating a linear feature performing shortest path analysis on raster terrain data: 1) the connectivity of the network generated by connecting raster cells to their neighbors, and 2) the range of the attribute scale for assigning costs. Such analysis is commonly used to locate transmission lines, where the results could have major implications on project cost and its environmental impact. Experiments in solving biobjective shortest paths show that results are highly dependent on the parameters of the data representations, with exceedingly variable results based on the choices made in reclassifying attributes and generating networks from the raster. Based on these outcomes, we outline recommendations for ensuring geographic information system (GIS) data representations maintain analysis results that are accurate and unbiased."
https://openalex.org/W3155423409,"Aims The aim of this study was to determine the association between social determinants of health and direct economic burden on Chinese middle-aged and elderly individuals living with diabetes in China. Methods This study used data from the baseline wave of The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) database, covering 17,708 middle-aged and elderly residents in China. The population with diabetes was grouped into those diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DDM) and those undiagnosed with diabetes mellitus (UDM). Direct economic cost data, including total direct medical costs (TC) and out-of-pocket (OOP) payments, were extracted as outcome variables. A two-part model was applied to analyze the association between social determinants of health and direct economic burden. Results In our analysis, we included 958 patients with DDM and 1,285 patients with UDM. The mean TC and OOP payments were 11,193 CNY (US $1,733; 6.46 CNY = 1 USD) and 7,266 CNY (US $1,125) in DDM patients, and 3,700 CNY (US $573) and 3,060 CNY (US $474) in UDM patients. Rural-urban status (p&lt;0.05), regional status (p&lt;0.05), household personal consumption expenditures (p&lt;0.05), and comorbidities(p&lt;0.05) were crucial factors associated with medical costs in people with diabetes. Conclusion Although progress has been made in the development of current health policies intended to contain the direct economic burden of diabetes, the gaps in that burden in populations with different social characteristics remains a burning issue. More policy breakthroughs are needed to achieve health equity."
https://openalex.org/W3152718532,"Neuromedin U (NMU), a highly conserved peptide in mammals, is involved in a wide variety of physiological processes, including impairment of pancreatic β-cell function via induction of mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ultimately suppressing insulin secretion. NMU has two receptors, NMU receptor 1 (NMUR1) and NMUR2, both of which are G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). Only NMUR1 is expressed in mouse islets and β cell–derived MIN6-K8 cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying the insulinostatic action mediated by NMUR1 in β cells have yet to be elucidated. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism driving impairment of insulin secretion in β cells by the NMU–NMUR1 axis. Pretreatment with the Gα i/o inhibitor Bordetella pertussis toxin (PTX), but not the Gα q inhibitor YM254890, abolished NMU-induced suppression of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and calcium response in β cells. Knockdown of Gα i2 and Gα o in β cells counteracted NMU-induced suppression of insulin secretion and gene alterations related to mitochondrial fusion ( Mfn1 , Mfn2 ), fission ( Fis1 , Drp1 ), mitophagy ( Pink1 , Park2 ), mitochondrial dynamics ( Pgc-1α , Nrf1 , and Tfam ), ER stress ( Chop , Atp2a3 , Ryr2 , and Itpr2 ), intracellular ATP level, and mitochondrial membrane potential. NMU decreased forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP in both mouse and human islets. We concluded that NMUR1 coupled to PTX-sensitive Gα i2 and Gα o proteins in β cells reduced intracellular Ca 2+ influx and cAMP level, thereby causing β-cell dysfunction and impairment. These results highlight a novel signaling mechanism of NMU and provide valuable insights into the further investigation of NMU functions in β-cell biology."

In the future, we expect even more jobs submitted to PATRIC will use metagenomic data. One in-demand use case is the extraction of near-complete draft genomes from assembled contigs of metagenomic origin. The PATRIC metagenome binning service utilizes the PATRIC database to furnish a large, diverse set of reference genomes. We provide a new service for supervised extraction and annotation of high-quality, near-complete genomes from metagenomically-derived contigs. Reference genomes are assigned to putative draft genome bins based on the presence of single-copy universal marker roles in the sample, and contigs are sorted into these bins by their similarity to reference genomes in PATRIC. Each set of binned contigs represents a draft genome that will be annotated by RASTtk in PATRIC. A structured-language binning report is provided containing quality measurements and taxonomic information about the contig bins. The PATRIC metagenome binning service emphasizes extraction of high-quality genomes for downstream analysis using other PATRIC tools and services. Due to its supervised nature, the binning service is not appropriate for mining novel or extremely low-coverage genomes from metagenomic samples."

The spread of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria poses a challenge to disease control and highlights the need for novel antimicrobials. Owing to their critical role in protein synthesis, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, including the methionyl-tRNA synthetases MetRS1 and MetRS2, are attractive drug targets. MetRS1 has long been exploited as a drug target in Gram-positive bacteria and protozoan parasites. However, MetRS1 inhibitors have limited action upon Gram-negative pathogens or on Gram-positive bacteria that produce MetRS2 enzymes. The underlying mechanism by which MetRS2 enzymes are insensitive to MetRS1 inhibitors is presently unknown. Herein, we report the first structures of MetRS2 from a multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterium in its ligand-free state and bound to its substrate or MetRS1 inhibitors. The structures reveal the binding mode of two diaryldiamine MetRS1 inhibitors that occupy the amino acid–binding site and a surrounding auxiliary pocket implicated in tRNA acceptor arm binding. The structural features associated with amino acid polymorphisms found in the methionine and auxiliary pockets reveal the molecular basis for diaryldiamine binding and selectivity between MetRS1 and MetRS2 enzymes. Moreover, we show that mutations in key polymorphic residues in the methionine and auxiliary pockets not only altered inhibitor binding affinity but also significantly reduced enzyme function. Our findings thus reinforce the tRNA acceptor arm binding site as a druggable pocket in class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and provide a structural basis for optimization of MetRS2 inhibitors for the development of new antimicrobials against Gram-negative pathogens.

These bacterial pathogens are not only responsible for important losses in agriculture and livestock production but are also the major cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. In fact, one of the major concerns regarding human bacterial infections nowadays is the escalating development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) developed by many Gram-negative pathogens (1Mansfield J.

MetRS recognizes both the initiator and elongator cognate tRNAs and charges L-methionine (L-Met) to their acceptor arms (7Kozak M.

In addition, the functional relevance of the so-called ‘auxiliary pocket’, usually occupied by MetRS1 inhibitors, remains elusive. In this work, we report the first free and ligand-bound structures of the single MetRS2 enzyme (XcMetRS) found in the Gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas citri, an economically important citrus disease pathogen (50Abe V.Y. Benedetti C.E. Additive roles of PthAs in bacterial growth and pathogenicity associated with nucleotide polymorphisms in effector-binding elements of citrus canker susceptibility genes.Mol.

Plant Pathol. 2003; 4: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) that, as shown here, is naturally resistant to multiple antibiotics. The structures reported here revealed the binding mode of two MetRS1 inhibitors (REP8839 and REP3123) that occupy both the methionine site and so-called auxiliary pocket formed upon ligand binding. Our data also provide a structural basis for the selectivity of MetRS1 inhibitors between MetRS1 and MetRS2 enzymes, which is consistent with the observation that such inhibitors display low binding affinities to XcMetRS and weakly inhibited X. citri growth. The low affinity of XcMetRS to REP8839, for instance, was reverted by a mutation in the auxiliary pocket, which, as proposed here, is the binding site of the tRNA acceptor arm, a feature that appears to prevail in all class Ia AaRS. X. citri is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes all commercial citrus varieties (50Abe V.Y. Benedetti C.E. Additive roles of PthAs in bacterial growth and pathogenicity associated with nucleotide polymorphisms in effector-binding elements of citrus canker susceptibility genes.Mol. Plant Pathol. 2016; 17: 1223-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 51Brunings A.M. Gabriel D.W. Xanthomonas citri: Breaking the surface.Mol. Plant Pathol. 2003; 4: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Some X. citri strains were reported to be resistant against bacteriocins, and penicillin (52Gholami D. Aminzadeh S. Alavi S.M. Kazemipour N. Ghoroghi A. Emruzi Z. Comparison of antibiotics and bacteriocins antibacterial activity on Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri.Iran. J. Fish. Sci. 2018; 17: 162-1778Google Scholar). To investigate whether the X. citri strain 306 also displays natural resistance against antibiotics, we performed antibiograms using agar disc-diffusion assays. The results reveal that the X. citri strain 306 is resistant to several beta-lactams including ampicillin and amoxicillin, monobactams (Aztreonam), cephalosporins of first (cephalothin), second (cefaclor and cefoxitin), third (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime), and fourth (cefepime) generations, and to imipenem, which are widely used in clinical medicine (Fig. S1). In addition, X. citri is resistant to nitrofurantoin, a nitrofuran antibiotic commonly used to treat urinary tract infections and showed inhibition halos for tobramycin and neomycin that are close to breakpoint values considered for a resistant phenotype (Fig. S1). This makes X. citri an attractive Gram-negative plant pathogen model for studies of AMR and susceptibility to new antibiotics. Taking this into account and considering that X. citri carries a single MetRS gene, this work provides the first biochemical and structural characterization of a phytopathogen MetRS that can be exploited as a drug target. As observed for the majority of Xanthomonas species that infect plants, X. citri encodes only one MetRS, here called XcMetRS. Protein sequence analyses show that XcMetRS is a 75-kDa protein that is closely related to MetRS2 found in Gram-negative bacteria and in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells (Fig. 1). In addition to the canonical anticodon-binding domain and the classical signature motifs ‘HLGH’ and ‘KMSKS’ of class I AaRS, XcMetRS has a CP domain comprising two knuckles and a C-terminal extension that generally acts as a dimerization domain (53Crepin T.

https://openalex.org/W3155496693,"Objective We sought to identify plasma protein biomarkers that are predictive of the outcome of rescue cerclage in patients with cervical insufficiency. Methods This retrospective cohort study included 39 singleton pregnant women undergoing rescue cerclage for cervical insufficiency (17–25 weeks) who gave plasma samples. Three sets of pooled plasma samples from controls (cerclage success, n = 10) and cases (cerclage failure, n = 10, defined as spontaneous preterm delivery at &lt;33 weeks) were labeled with 6-plex tandem mass tag (TMT) reagents and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Differentially expressed proteins between the two groups were selected from the TMT-based quantitative analysis. Multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) analysis was further used to verify the candidate proteins of interest in patients with cervical insufficiency in the final cohort (n = 39). Results From MRM-MS analysis of the 40 proteins showing statistically significant changes ( P &lt; 0.05) from the TMT-based quantitative analysis, plasma IGFBP-2, PSG4, and PGLYRP2 levels were found to be significantly increased, whereas plasma MET and LXN levels were significantly decreased in women with cerclage failure. Of these, IGFBP-2, PSG4, and LXN levels in plasma were independent of cervical dilatation. A multiple-biomarker panel was developed for the prediction of cerclage failure, using a stepwise regression procedure, which included the plasma IGFBP-2, PSG4, and LXN (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.916). The AUC for this multiple-biomarker panel was significantly greater than the AUC for any single biomarker included in the multi-biomarker model. Conclusions Proteomic analysis identified useful and independent plasma biomarkers (IGFBP-2, PSG4, and LXN; verified by MRM) that predict poor pregnancy outcome following rescue cerclage. Their combined analysis in a multi-biomarker panel significantly improved predictability."
https://openalex.org/W3155211318,"Purpose To investigate the association between peripheral vasospasm and the visual field (VF) progression rate in patients with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) with low-teen intraocular pressure (IOP). Methods The finger temperature of 113 NTG patients was measured before and after exposure to ice water using a Temperature gun (cold pressor test). These patients had confirmed VF progression, despite a low-teen IOP during a follow-up period of &gt;5 years. VF progression rates were calculated as the slope of the visual field index (VFI) and mean deviation (MD) over time. Demographic, systemic, and ocular factors and VF progression rates were compared, based on the cold pressor test results. A regression analysis was used to investigate the factors affecting VF progression rates. Results Mean age, initial IOP, mean IOP during the follow-up period, and initial VF MD were 57.1 years, 15.8 mmHg, 12.0 mmHg, and -5.2 dB, respectively. When patients were divided into two groups (less vasospasm and more vasospasm) according to changes in temperature after exposure to ice water, the VF progression rate was significantly faster in the group with more vasospasm. In a multiple regression analysis, older age, worse initial VF MD, and greater decrease in finger temperature after ice water exposure were significantly associated with faster VF progression rates. Conclusion An excessive drop in finger temperature after exposure to ice water was significantly associated with faster VF progression in patients with low-teen NTG. This suggests that the blood flow in the optic nerve head may also be disturbed by peripheral vasospasm, accelerating glaucomatous damage regardless of IOP."

The aim of this study was to assess the role played by the human HLA-DRβ molecule containing the shared epitope supplied as a transgene to I-A˚ (murine class II null) C57BL/6 (B6) mice in driving these findings. We compared various immune response parameters as well as alveolar and peri-articular bone loss between humanized B6.DR1 (or B6.DR4) mice and their WT (B6) counterparts. We found that the presence of the shared epitope in the context of inoculation with P. gingivalis enhanced the percentage of Th17 cells generated, dramatically enhanced bone loss and importantly allowed for the generation of CCP2⁺ ACPAs that are not found in C57BL/6 or DBA/1 arthritic mouse serum. Due to the exceedingly complex nature of environmental factors impacting on genetic elements, it has been difficult to unravel mechanisms that drive autoimmune arthritis in susceptible individuals. The findings in this study may provide one small piece of this puzzle that can help us to better understand part of this complexity."
https://openalex.org/W3156547836,"Purpose To evaluate the impact of modifications to anatomical apical dissection including a puboprostatic open-collar technique, which visualizes the lateral aspect of the apex and dorsal vein complex (DVC) covering the rhabdosphincter while preserving the puboprostatic collar, on positive surgical margin (PSM) and continence recovery. Methods One-hundred-and-sixty-seven patients underwent gasless single-port retroperitoneoscopic radical prostatectomy using a three-dimensional head-mounted display system. Sequentially modified surgical techniques comprised puboprostatic open-collar technique, sutureless transection of the DVC, retrograde urethral dissection, and anterior reconstruction. The associations of these modifications with PSM and continence recovery were assessed. Results The puboprostatic open-collar technique, sutureless DVC transection, and retrograde urethral dissection were significantly associated with lower apical PSM (P = 0.003, 0.003, and 0.010, respectively). The former two also showed similar associations in 84 patients with anterior apical tumor (P = 0.021 and 0.030, respectively). Among 92 patients undergoing all of these three procedures, overall and apical PSM rates were 13.0% and 3.3%, respectively. Retrograde urethral dissection (odds ratio [OR] 2.73, P = 0.004) together with nerve sparing (OR 2.77, P = 0.003) and anterior apical tumor (OR 0.45, P = 0.017) were independently associated with immediate continence recovery. A multivariable model for 3-month continence recovery included anterior apical tumor (OR 0.28, P = 0.003) and puboprostatic open-collar technique (OR 3.42, P = 0.062). Immediate and 3-month continence recovery rates were 56.3% and 85.4%, respectively, in 103 patients undergoing both the puboprostatic open-collar technique and retrograde urethral dissection. Conclusion Novel anatomical apical dissection utilizing a puboprostatic open-collar technique may favorably impact on both apical surgical margin and continence recovery."

https://openalex.org/W3152857553,"Background The incidence of invasive meningococcal disease due to serogroup C (MenC) decreased in Portugal since the introduction of the conjugate vaccine (MCC) in the free market in 2001 and in the National Immunisation Plan in 2006. Considering the potential waning of the antibody response reported in the literature, the different vaccination schemes that were used in our country over the past decade, and that Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C continues to circulate, the Portuguese population may currently be at increased risk of infection. In the absence of national data, we evaluated the seroprotection level of the Portuguese population against MenC, in order to identify the protected fraction of the population and ponder on the necessity of a booster dose of the MCC vaccine. Methods We measured serum bactericidal antibody levels against MenC in a representative sample of the population (n = 1500) aged 2–64 years who participated in the 2015/2016 National Serological Survey. Results A total of 31.1% (466/1500, 95%CI: 29–33%) of the individuals studied were protected against MenC. The geometric mean titre was 6.5. The proportion of seroprotected was particularly low in children aged 2–4 years (&lt;16%) who received a single dose of the vaccine at 12 months of age (vaccination strategy since 2012). The proportion of seroprotected was higher (44.7% to 53.5%) in adolescent and young adults (15–24 years of age), resulting from vaccination during the catch-up campaign at 5–15 years of age. The highest protection rates were observed when the vaccine was administered during adolescence. Conclusion The small fraction of population seroprotected, combined with the already known waning effect of the antibody response over time, may indicate that the Portuguese population will become progressively more exposed to the risk of infection. Taking in consideration our results, we recommend to change the current vaccination strategy and introduce a booster dose of the MCC vaccine during adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W3153999236,"Background The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) entered Cameroon’s childhood national immunization programme (NIP) in July 2011 under a 3-dose schedule (6, 10, 14 weeks of age) without any catch-up. We described the impact of PCV13 onserotype distribution among pneumococcal meningitis cases over time. Methods We used laboratory-based sentinel surveillance data to identify meningitis cases among 2- to 59-month-old children with clinically-suspected bacterial meningitis (CSBM) admitted to hospitals in Yaoundé (August 2011-December 2018). Purulent meningitis cases had a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell (WBC) count ≥20 per mm 3 . Pneumococcal meningitis cases had S . pneumoniae identified from CSF, with serotyping by polymerase chain reaction. Years 2011-2014 were described as early PCV13 era (EPE) and years 2015-2018 as late PCV13 era (LPE) impact periods. Results Among children hospitalized with CSBM who had a lumbar puncture obtained, there was no significant change from the EPE versus the LPE in the percentage identified with purulent meningitis: 7.5% (112/1486) versus 9.4% (154/1645), p = 0.0846. The percentage of pneumococcal meningitis cases due to PCV13 vaccine-serotype (VST) decreased from 62.0% (31/50) during the EPE to 35.8% (19/53) in the LPE, p = 0.0081. The most frequent pneumococcal meningitis VSTs during the EPE were 6A/6B (30%) and 5 (6%), and during the LPE were 14 (13.2%), 3 (7.6%), 4 (5.6%) and 18C (5.6%). Conclusion Four to seven years after PCV13 introduction, the proportion of pneumococcal meningitis due to vaccine serotypes has declined, mainly due to reductions of serotypes 6A/6B, 1, 19A, and 23F; nevertheless, PCV13 VSTs remain common. Because the analyzed surveillance system was not consistent or population based, we could not estimate incidence or overall impact; this emphasizes the need for improved surveillance to document further the utility of PCV13 immunization in Cameroon."

One of the major post-translational modifications is the isomerization of aspartate residues (L-isoAsp), which could be non-enzymatically and spontaneously occurring in proteins, resulting in various effects on the structure and function of proteins including short peptides. We have reported that the structure and function of an αA66–80 peptide, corresponding to the 66–80 ( 66 SDRDKFVIFLDVKHF 80 ) fragment of human lens αA-crystallin, was dramatically altered by the isomerization of aspartate residue (Asp) at position 76. In the current study, we observed amyloid-like fibrils of L-isoAsp containing αA66–80 using electron microscopy. The contribution of each amino acid for the peptide structure was further evaluated by circular dichroism (CD), bis-ANS, and thioflavin T fluorescence using 14 alanine substituents of αA66–80, including L-isoAsp at position 76. CD of 14 alanine substituents demonstrated random coiled structures except for the substituents of positively charged residues. Bis-ANS fluorescence of peptide with substitution of hydrophobic residue with alanine revealed decreased hydrophobicity of the peptide. Thioflavin T fluorescence also showed that the hydrophobicity around Asp76 of the peptide is important for the formation of amyloid-like fibrils. One of the substitutes, H79A (SDRDKFVIFL(L-isoD)VKAF) demonstrated an exact β-sheet structure in CD and highly increased Thioflavin T fluorescence. This phenomenon was inhibited by the addition of protein-L-isoaspartate O -methyltransferase (PIMT), which is an enzyme that changes L-isoAsp into Asp. These interactions were observed even after the formation of amyloid-like fibrils. Thus, isomerization of Asp in peptide is key to form fibrils of αA-crystallin-derived peptide, and L-isoAsp on fibrils can be a candidate for disassembling amyloid-like fibrils of αA-crystallin-derived peptides."
https://openalex.org/W3156699374,"For the requirement in container nursery culture that growing media should be achieved the appropriate degree compaction, this paper presents an experiment on the compaction dynamics of air-dried soil under repetitive drop shocks, as a preliminary step toward the mechanization of this compaction method. The drop height used to adjust the shock intensity included 2 mm, 4 mm, 5 mm and 6 mm. And the overall packing density of soil in a vertically stratified cylinder vessel and the local packing density in each layer were taken as indicators of soil compaction states. The stretched exponential function derived from KWW law than the empirical inverse-logarithmic function has been found to be more suitable for expressing the temporal evolution of soil compaction, according to the results of curve-fitting to test values of the overall and local density. It is inherent in this experimental configuration that the drop shock intensity even at a constant drop height varies with drop times, owing to the interaction between the soil packing itself and drop shocks caused by the combination of the packing and the container. But the function t / τ f ( t,H ) is manifested as a straight line on the drop times t with the line slope related to the drop height H , so the soil compaction dynamics caused by its drop shocks and that under the condition with actively controlled intensity actually share the common relaxation law. In addition, the soil’s one-dimensional distribution of local packing density showed a slight positive gradient as similar as monodisperse particles did."
https://openalex.org/W3153116860,"In the present study, we examined the importance of Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) in the regulation of cardiac function using genetically modified CaMKIV-null mice. RT-PCR analysis revealed decreased expression of voltage-dependent calcium channels in the cardiac myocytes of CaMKIV-null mice compared with wild-type mice. CaMKIV-null mice showed shortened QT time on electrocardiograms. Pharmacological analysis revealed decreased responsiveness to the β-adrenergic blocker propranolol in CaMKIV-null mice, whereas the plasma norepinephrine level was not affected. CaMKIV-null mice showed decreased baroreflex on electrocardiograms. Heart rate variability analysis showed unstable R-R intervals, a decreased low frequency power/high frequency power (LF/HF) ratio, and increased standard deviation of the normal to normal R-R intervals (SDNN) in CaMKIV-null mice, suggesting decreased responsiveness to β-adrenergic stimulation in CaMKIV-null mice. Atrial contraction analysis and cardiac action potential recording showed a decreased response to the β-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol in CaMKIV-null mice. Furthermore, fluorescence imaging in a CRE-hrGFP assay revealed a decreased response to isoproterenol in CaMKIV-null cardiac myocytes. Taken together, our data strongly suggest a significant effect of CaMKIV gene ablation on cardiac β-adrenergic signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W3154066093,"Ethnic and gendered employment gaps are mainly explained by individual characteristics, while less attention is paid to occupational structures. Drawing on administrative data, this article analyses the impact of occupational characteristics on top of individual attributes in the urban labour market of Vienna. Both set of variables can explain observed employment gaps to a large extent, but persistent gaps remain, in particular among females. The article’s main finding is that the occupational structure appears to have gendered effects. While men tend to benefit from ethnic segregation, women face difficulties when looking for jobs with high shares of immigrant workers. Looking for jobs in occupations that recruit from relatively few educational backgrounds (credentials) is beneficial for both sexes at the outset unemployment, but among females this competitive advantage diminishes over time. The article concludes by discussing potential strategies to avoid the traps of occupational segregation."
https://openalex.org/W3155134608,"Understanding the factors that underlie the epigenetic regulation of genes is crucial to understand the gene regulatory machinery as a whole. Several experimental and computational studies examined the relationship between different factors involved. Here we investigate the relationship between transcription factors (TFs) and histone modifications (HMs), based on ChIP-seq data in cell lines. As it was shown that gene regulation by TFs differs depending on the CpG class of a promoter, we study the impact of the CpG content in promoters on the associations between TFs and HMs. We suggest an approach based on sparse linear regression models to infer associations between TFs and HMs with respect to CpG content. A study of the partial correlation of HMs for the two classes of high and low CpG content reveals possible CpG dependence and potential candidates for confounding factors in our models. We show that the models are accurate, inferred associations reflect known biological relationships, and we give new insight into associations with respect to CpG content. Moreover, analysis of a ChIP-seq dataset in HepG2 cells of the HM H3K122ac, an HM about little is known, reveals novel TF associations and supports a previously established link to active transcription."
