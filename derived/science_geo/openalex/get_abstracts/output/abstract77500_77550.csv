https://openalex.org/W2040343620,"Taste preferences of mature male and female rats for caloric and noncaloric sweet solutions have been found to differ. Although females do not drink more water than males, they consume significantly greater quantities of a slightly sweet 3 percent glucose and a very sweet 0.25 percent saccharin solution. When given a choice, males switch their initial preference for a saccharin solution to a preference for a glucose solution after several days, while females maintain a preference for the saccharin solution. Females also prefer significantly higher concentrations of saccharin than males do."
https://openalex.org/W2035827400,"A small Neotropical frog, Dendrobates pumilio, undergoes interpopulational variation in color, degree of toxicity, size, and habits. Differences in body coloration encompass the visible spectrum from red to blue, as well as achromatic black and white. There are wide variations in the degree of toxicity, but these variations are not correlated with supposed warning colors. Extracts of skin yield two toxic compounds characterized as steroidal alkaloids with molecular formulae C(19)H(33)NO(2) and C(l9)H(33)NO(3). The rapid rate of divergent evolution among populations of this frog may result from isolation and chance restriction of original heterozygosity, with subsequent selection acting on different and greatly limited mixtures of alleles."
https://openalex.org/W1501231487,"Hydroxyurea inhibits deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in mouse fibroblast (L) cells by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase. No other site of action could be found. Inhibition can be reversed either by removal of the drug or by addition of deoxyribonucleosides. Although pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides are readily phosphorylated by the cells, the corresponding purine compounds are largely converted to ribonucleotides. Following incubation for 18 hours in hydroxyurea, L cells washed free of inhibitor showed a burst of DNA synthesis lasting about 8 hours and involving 70% of the cells."
https://openalex.org/W2013508219,"Populations of synaptic vesicles within cerebellar terminals considered excitatory or inhibitory on the basis of physiological evidence differ with respect to size and shape. Size rather than shape appears to be the main morphological difference between these populations. Elongation of vesicles is depenident on fixation with aldehyde fixatives, and both size and elongation change with age mainly during maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2055666151,"The fluorescence decay time (tau) was 2 to 5 nanoseconds for proteins and 4 to 5 nanoseconds for flavin, pyridine nucleotide, and vitamin B(6)coenzymes; tau varied widely in 48 compounds measured in water. Altholugh reported values of tau for a few of the soluttions studied were in excellenlt agreement. previously ""calculated"" lifetimes, in severall instances, are apparently erroneous. Nonexponential decay was detectable with our ""nanosecond-flash"" apparatus, a modification of the first commercially aavilable unit for determination of tau."
https://openalex.org/W2058659438,Ethylene at low concentrations inhibits the light-induced opening of the bean hypocotyl hook; auxin inhibits the opening by inducing production of ethylene. Light causes a decrease in ethylene production and an increase in the production of carbon dioxide. Hook opening appears to be a response in which ethylene serves as a natural growth regulator and in which carbon dioxide may be involved also as a growth regulator through its antagonism of the action of ethylene.
https://openalex.org/W1602522283,Abstract Insulin administered in vivo activates dog liver uridine diphosphate glucose-glycogen transferase within 7 to 13 min. It also inactivates phosphorylase. Glucagon reverses these changes equally rapidly. Transferase I has an apparent Km for UDP-glucose which is calculated to be 17-fold lower than that for transferase D. Interconversion of transferase D and I activities in liver is suggested to occur and to be catalyzed by an enzymic system which may be similar to that in muscle.
https://openalex.org/W2063918831,The nerve-impuilse-blocking actions of derivatives of tetrodotoxin have been tested on lobster and squid axons. The block produced by deoxytetrodotoxin was similar to that produced by tetrodotoxin and was probably caused by tetrodotoxin contamination. Tetrodaminotoxin and anhydrotetrodotoxin also produced a similar block but at such high concentrations that tetrodotoxin contamination cannot be ruled out. The hydroxyl group of C(4) and the hemilactal oxygen links play an important role for the nerve-blocking action.
https://openalex.org/W2090483167,"Differentiation of mouse mammary gland in vitro requires insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin. The epithelial cells must first divide in order to synthesize casein in response to these hormones. Insulin is required for the initiation of DNA synthesis and is also necessary during G1 phase (after mitosis). Prolactin can elicit the overt differentiative responses after mitosis. Activity of hydrocortisone precedes that of prolactin, that is, after mitosis it is not capable of eliciting the differentiative response."

Magnetic signals with amplitudes of 10(-8) to 10(-7) gauss were detected synchronously with the electrocardiogram, confirming previous reports. A magnetocardiographic chest map, consisting of the magnetic field plotted against time at various spatial positions, shows genteral QRS and T-wave structure, as in the electrocardiogram; this structure varies with spatial position."
https://openalex.org/W1487492836,"Abstract The separation, base composition, and determination of the nucleotide sequences of the products of pancreatic ribonuclease and RNase T1 digestion of yeast tyrosine transfer ribonucleic acid are described. Analyses of the two digests are in excellent agreement and indicate that the tyrosine RNA is composed of 78 nucleotides. There are 16 residues of 9 different modified nucleotides present. The 5'-phosphate terminal residue is pCp, the first time any nucleotide other than pGp has been detected in this position in a purified transfer RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2007324177,"Pigeons learned to discriminate between a white vertical line on a dark background (S+) and a monochromatic circle of light (S—) either with or without responses to s—(errors). Gradients of inhibition, which were centered around S—, and which had greater than zero slopes, were obtained only from those subjects who learned to discriminate with errors. The results indicate that the occurrence of errors is a necessary condition for S—to function as an inhibitory stimulus. This finding is consistent with other performance differences in subjects who have learned to discriminate with and without errors."

https://openalex.org/W1573797413,"Abstract Glutamyl ribonucleic acid synthetase was purified approximately 150-fold from homogenates of rat liver to a specific activity of 60 mµmoles of glutamyl-RNA formed per min per mg of protein. The enzyme at this stage of purification was judged to be about 40% pure, but in a state of aggregation. Although the enzyme was quite stable to storage, it was very heat labile, and lost activity during its assay. The purified enzyme required Mg++, adenosine triphosphate, l-glutamate, and soluble RNA for activity. Evidence is presented for the existence of distinct enzymes for glutamyl-RNA and glutaminyl-RNA formation. A rapid method for obtaining pure soluble RNA from liver is also described."
https://openalex.org/W2095057599,A protein that inhibited mitosis of normal human diploid cells was demonstrated in extracts of WI-38 cells that were infected with rubella virus and that had gone into mitotic arrest subsequent to infection. A possible mechanism for the pathogenesis of the rubella syndrome is suggested.
https://openalex.org/W1973225907,"As judged by the number of species, or of individuals, arthropods are an extremely successful group of desert inhabitants. There is very great structural and physiological diversity within the group, and since adaptations to desert life open to one are not open to all. we should not expect to find the maximum possible development of adaptive features in any arthropod simply because it lives in a desert. Most adult insects fly; their larvae and all other arthropods do not, and their adaptations will differ accordingly. Desert beetles have very impermeable cuticles and tolerate high body temperatures, while desert cockroaches live below the sand. have more permeable cuticles, and absorb water vapor. There is probably no single respect in which all desert arthropods differ from insects of other environments. Perhaps a profitable way of viewing desert animals is to recognize that each is a whole organism with a specific collection of adaptations that must be consistent within themselves and which are associated with a specific mode of life and a specific evolutionary history. The arthropod organization is capable of producing highly efficient desert species. There is, however, a converse way of looking at the situation, Which is often neglected but which may be of general biological interest: does the evolution of adaptations to desert environments necessarily involve loss of viability in more mesic habitats? If so, then what are these disavantages- what, for example, is the disadvantage of a highly impermeable cuticle? In some cases the answer is clear: sandroaches need sand dunes to live in because they are morphologically and behaviorly specialized for this habitat. More often the answer is not obvious."
https://openalex.org/W1531743539,Abstract The isolation and analysis of large oligonucleotides produced by partial digestion of yeast tyrosine transfer ribonucleic acid with ribonuclease T1 are described. The analyses provided sufficient information to complete the nucleotide sequence of yeast tyrosine transfer RNA.
https://openalex.org/W1511706565,"Abstract The effect of a number of heavy metal ions on the energy-linked accumulation of Mg++ by isolated heart mitochondria has been studied with the use of ascorbate and tetramethylphenylenediamine as the energy source. With this substrate Mg++ uptake is activated strongly by Zn++ and Cd++, and to a lesser degree by Cu++, Hg++, and Ag+. In contrast to this activation of Mg++ accumulation, these reagents depress oxidative phosphorylation and the energy-linked accumulation of Ca++. The cation-dependent increase in Mg++ accumulation requires phosphate or arsenate and is inhibited by inhibitors of respiration and uncouplers of phosphorylation. It is strongly inhibited by adenosine diphosphate and by sulfhydryl group reagents, but is insensitive to oligomycin. It is also depressed by Na+ and K+. The increased ion uptake in the presence of Zn++ is accompanied by increased respiration. This observation is consistent with a greater demand for free energy to support the increased ion accumulation. Zn++ has little effect on the loss of accumulated ions to the suspending medium, and appears to act by stimulating the rate of uptake of Mg++. A large portion of the available Zn++ is taken up by the mitochondria in a reaction which does not require the expenditure of free energy. Mitochondria which are tightly coupled accumulate Mg++ rather slowly compared to preparations which show poorer respiratory control. Mg++ accumulation in tightly coupled mitochondria is activated to a greater degree by Zn++ and Cd++ than is the corresponding reaction in more loosely coupled preparations. It is suggested that specific membrane lesions which favor the energy-linked uptake of Mg++ can be induced by the addition of Zn++ or Cd++, and perhaps by other procedures. The relationship of the Zn++-dependent uptake of Mg++ to other induced ion transport systems of the mitochondrion is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2066076301,"Hexokinase activity in human erythrocytes is associated with three electrophoretically distinct bands. Normal adult erythrocytes contain hexokinases Types I and III. Type II hexokinase is present in the erythrocytes of newborn infants and absent from those of normal adults; it is, however, present in erythrocytes of adults with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. Type II hexokinase and fetal hemtoglobin appear to be associated."
https://openalex.org/W2116636838,The long-range repulsion observed between bileaflets of lecithin cannot be explained either with the usual view that the polar groups are arrayed coplanar with the bileaflet surface or by the assumption that charges protrude straight into the aqueous environment. Statistical-thermodynamic analysis of experimental data suggests rather that structure of the leaflet surface is better described as a diffuse charge layer. Forces between leaflets are caused largely by entropy changes in the surface with leaflet separation.
https://openalex.org/W2016953803,The effects of amino acids or mixtures of amino acids on the spike discharges from the optic ganglion cells were studied. Mixtures of amino acids have different effects than single amino acids. Proper composition of excitatory and inhibitory amino acids can enhance only the light-induced spikes without giving rise to any spontaneous discharges. It is implied that amino acids may play an important role in the regulation of the general sensitivity of cells in the central nervous system.

https://openalex.org/W1565199939,Sodium borohydride reduces selectively two disulfide bonds in trypsinogen and trypsin which are nonessential for activity. Chymotrypsinogen and chymotrypsin are not reduced under these conditions. The disulfide which is modified in trypsinogen is located in a homologous position in chymotrypsinogen which suggests that the two proteins differ in conformation in this region.

https://openalex.org/W2065377204,"During transformation and division of lymphocytes in culture, the lactic dehydrogenase isozymes migrate increasingly toward the cathode. With extension of the time in culture, the mitotic index declines, and the isozyme pattern reverts to dominance of those bands that move toward the anode, despite the cellular tendency to anaerobic metabolism. These findings suggest that synthesis of the more slowly migrating lactic dehydrogenase isozymes in this system is related to mitotic activity, and not to the aerobic or anaerobic conditions of cell culture."

This decrease is related to the time of birth rather than the gestational age of the piglets, although the latter is also associated with a gradual decrease in brain protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1580670950,"Abstract In order to clarify the mechanism of activation of l-threonine deaminase by adenosine diphosphate, the enzyme was purified about 700-fold from sonic extracts of Clostridium tetanomorphum, and kinetic and ADP-binding studies were carried out. Plots of reaction rates against l-threonine concentrations gave a sigmoid curve in the absence of ADP, whereas a hyperbolic curve was obtained in the presence of 10-3 m ADP. Double reciprocal plots were parabolic in the former and linear in the latter case. Different pH profiles of the apparent Km and maximal velocity were observed with and without ADP. A linear Arrhenius plot was obtained in the absence of ADP, whereas a discontinuity in the slope was found in the presence of ADP. Values of the activation energy were calculated to be 13.9 and 11.4 kcal per mole over the temperature range of 4–37° in the absence and presence of ADP, respectively. The Michaelis constant for ADP as an activator was 2.3 x 10-5 m at a threonine concentration of 10-3 m. No mutual effect of ADP and threonine on Km and Ka was observed. Adenosine triphosphate offset activation of the enzyme by ADP, and increased the sigmoid nature of the rate-substrate concentration curve. d-Threonine and semicarbazine inhibited the deaminase activity competitively toward l-threonine both in the presence and in the absence of ADP. p-Chloromercuribenzoate inhibited the enzyme competitively toward l-threonine in the absence of ADP, but noncompetitively in the presence of ADP. The dissociation constant for ADP, estimated by equilibrium dialysis, was 3.0 x 10-5 m, which agreed reasonably well with the value obtained from reaction kinetics. d-Threonine did not interfere with the binding of ADP. On the basis of kinetic analysis, two substrate sites are postulated, a catalytic site with a dissociation constant for substrate (Ks) of 3.5 x 10-3 m, and an activating site with a Ks of 3.3 x 10-2 m."
https://openalex.org/W1990085415,"Children of three ages were compared with adults in a recognition experiment requiring continuous processing of information. The growth in precision for visually presented words is steeper than for auditorially presented words, largely because the former are harder for the first graders and, to a lesser extent, for the third graders. In adults, visual processing of information is at least as good as auditory. The use of receiver operating characteristic curves in describing the data permit greater precision in estimating the capacity of the individual subjects and are particularly useful since the errors of failure to recognize were different from ordinary errors of false recognition, and they occurred in large numbers."
https://openalex.org/W1529970196,Abstract Bovine serum albumin has been cojugated with pyrene butyric acid. Fluorescence depolarization measurements indicate that the fluorescence lifetime is 5 to 10 times longer than that of other fluorescent dyes used to prepare fluorescent protein conjugates.
https://openalex.org/W1580657389,"Abstract An enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from trimethylsulfonium chloride to tetrahydrofolate has been isolated from a species of Pseudomonas. This enzyme has been partially purified and several of its properties have been studied. The reaction can be formulated as a simple methyl transfer, with the formation of dimethyl sulfide and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Neither S-adenosylmethionine nor dimethyl-β-propiothetin can replace trimethylsulfonium chloride as methyl donor. 2-Mercaptoethanol is unable to replace tetrahydrofolate as methyl acceptor. The enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 100,000. There is no vitamin B12 derivative associated with the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1543528076,"Abstract Peptides released during the early stages of digestion of myosin by trypsin and chymotrypsin have been isolated and their amino acid compositions determined as a function of the extent of proteolysis. The fractions of the myosin mass released as low molecular weight peptides at various times of digestion are reported. A comparison of the composition of the peptides released by both enzymes indicates that the rates of release of certain of the amino acids (lysine and arginine in the trypsin studies, and phenylalanine and tyrosine in the chymotrypsin studies) are direct reflections of the enzyme specificities. On the other hand, both enzymes release unusually high concentrations of proline residues in the early stages of digestion, and this behavior appears to be related to the conformational state of the proline-containing regions of the native molecules. Results suggest that the proline residues act to open a segment of the α-helical conformation in the myosin rod and to render this local region more susceptible to proteolytic attack. The mass of this region has been estimated at 75,000 to 95,000 g per mole."
https://openalex.org/W2029432989,"Plastic-film-type antitranspirants are more permeable to water vapor than to carbon dioxide. Photosynthesis in treated plants is reduced to the same or greater extent than transpiration, except under conditions of stress, when photosynthesis in treated plants is greater than in controls. This exception is attributed to reduction of stress, as the selective permeability of the films to gases would tend to produce the reverse effect."

When sections with a moving pulse were transferred to nitrogen, the rate fell below 2 millimeters per hour. This inhibition was completely reversible; sections returned to air moved the same amount of auxin as untreated aerobic controls."
https://openalex.org/W1974586615,"The tertiary analogute of phospholine, namely, (C(2)H(5)O)(2)P(O)SCH(2)CH(2)N(CH(3))(2), is a potent, irreversible inhibitor of cholinesterase which, when externally applied to the sqluid giant axon, readily penetrates in its inhibitory form into the axoplasm. However, even a 10(-2) molar solution of this compound does not block axonal conduction unless the axon is first treated with a low concentration of venom from the cottonmouth moccasin. The question of the activity of acetylcholinesterase in these axons is considered, and the possibility of subcellular permeability barriers for indivisual components of the excitable membrane is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1972985819,"A new group of gas-phase reactions have been shown to contribute to the photooxidation of hydrocarbons. The phtotooxidation of aliphatic aldehydes at wavelengths below 3400 angstroms produces intermediates that react with olefinic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Although the photooxidation rates are slower than those induced by nitrogen oxide, the rates are significant, considering the interest in urban atmospheric reactions. These results may indicate that the contro of nitrogen oxides alone may not effectively reduce photochemical air pollution."
https://openalex.org/W1967873217,Continuous gas chromatography has been achieved with a radialflow chromatographic channel free of packing and formed between two closely spaced (50 to 75 microns) disc surfaces (optically flat and solvent-coated) rotating at one-half or one revolution per second. This technique provides high capacity and immediate response (in a fraction of a second). Mixtures of hydrocarbon gases have been separated at flow rates of 6 to 30 cubic centimeters per minute with 100 to 150 cubic centimeters per minute of nitrogen carrier gas in a chromatographic channel only 39 millimeters long.

Except with the lowest dose, all unshielded, irradiated pairs or single irradiated animals died before 5 days had elapsed. In contrast, irradiated rats that had a shielded parabiont partner survived the 5-day period and many survived beyond 30 days. This is interpreted as protection against the acute intestinal death that normally occurs in the dose range investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1490209130,"Abstract The slow reduction of cytochrome c by certain synthetic polycations, which we reported previously, has been further investigated in an attempt to clarify the role of the charged groups in the reaction. We were unable, however, to eliminate the possibility that trace quantities of reducing structure may be present in the synthetic polyglucose derivatives employed. For this reason, we now favor this simpler interpretation. The effects of alcohols, urea, guanidine, and elevated temperature on the reduction have also been investigated during the course of these studies."
