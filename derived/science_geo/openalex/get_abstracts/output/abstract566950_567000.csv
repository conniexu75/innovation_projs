Intuition tells us that an isolated physical system subjected to a sudden change (i.e., quenching) will evolve in a way that maximizes its entropy. If the system is in a pure, zero-entropy quantum state, it is expected to remain so even after quenching. How do we then reconcile statistical mechanics with quantum laws? To address this question, Kaufman et al. used their quantum microscope to study strings of six rubidium atoms confined in the wells of an optical lattice (see the Perspective by Polkovnikov and Sels). When tunneling along the strings was suddenly switched on, the strings as a whole remained in a pure state, but smaller subsets of two or three atoms conformed to a thermal distribution. The force driving the thermalization was quantum entanglement. Science , this issue p. 794 ; see also p. 752"

They owe their amazing mechanical properties to their layered construction, which is a challenge for synthetic fabrication. Pearly nacre, for example, has proved challenging to make owing to its complex structure of aragonite crystals in an organic matrix. Using an assembly-and-mineralization approach, Mao et al. have managed to fabricate nacre in the laboratory (see the Perspective by Barthelat). First, a layered, three-dimensional chitosan matrix is made, within which aragonite nanocrystals are precipitated from a solution containing calcium bicarbonate.

To enable network reconstructions, we built a large-scale gene expression atlas composed of 62,547 messenger RNAs (mRNAs), 17,862 nonmodified proteins, and 6227 phosphoproteins harboring 31,595 phosphorylation sites quantified across maize development. Networks in which nodes are genes connected on the basis of highly correlated expression patterns of mRNAs were very different from networks that were based on coexpression of proteins. Roughly 85% of highly interconnected hubs were not conserved in expression between RNA and protein networks. However, networks from either data type were enriched in similar ontological categories and were effective in predicting known regulatory relationships. Integration of mRNA, protein, and phosphoprotein data sets greatly improved the predictive power of GRNs."

Lee et al. used a chiral metal-organic framework containing formate ligands that can bind and align molecules covalently to reduce this motion (see the Perspective by Öhrström). The structure and absolute configuration—i.e., which spatial arrangement of atoms is the R or S isomer—of several organic molecules can thus be measured. These range from small molecules, such as methanol, to complex plant hormones, such as gibberellins that have eight stereocenters or jasmonic acid, whose absolute configuration had not previously been directly established.

Here, we report computational design, synthesis, and progress toward assembly of a 3.97-megabase, 57-codon Escherichia coli genome in which all 62,214 instances of seven codons were replaced with synonymous alternatives across all protein-coding genes. We have validated 63% of recoded genes by individually testing 55 segments of 50 kilobases each. We observed that 91% of tested essential genes retained functionality with limited fitness effect. We demonstrate identification and correction of lethal design exceptions, only 13 of which were found in 2229 genes. This work underscores the feasibility of rewriting genomes and establishes a framework for large-scale design, assembly, troubleshooting, and phenotypic analysis of synthetic organisms."

Franzén et al. examined gene expression in tissues affected by coronary artery disease (CAD). They found that individuals with loci that have been associated with CAD in genome-wide analyses had different patterns of tissue-specific gene expression than individuals without these genetic variants. Similarly, tissues not associated with CAD did not have CAD-like expression patterns. Thus, tissue-specific data can be used to dissect the genetic effects that predispose individuals to CAD.

Preventing infections will rely on improving our understanding of how norovirus enters host cells. Orchard et al. show that the entry of murine norovirus (MNoV) into host cells requires a protein called CD300lf. In cell culture, mouse cells needed to express CD300lf in order for MNoV binding, entry, and replication to occur. Deleting the gene encoding CD300lf in mice protected them against MNoV infection. Human cells expressing CD300lf allowed MNoV to break the species barrier, a finding that may lead to new insights into the infectivity of this virus. Science , this issue p. 933"

https://openalex.org/W2515000591,"INTRODUCTION Technologies that enable the longitudinal tracking and recording of molecular events into genomic DNA would be useful for the detailed monitoring of cellular state in artificial and native contexts. Although previous systems have been used to memorize digital information such as the presence or absence of biological signals, tools for recording analog information such as the duration or magnitude of biological activity in human cells are needed. Here, we present Mammalian Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biological Events (mSCRIBE), a memory system for storing analog biological information in the form of accumulating DNA mutations in human cells. mSCRIBE leverages self-targeting guide RNAs (stgRNAs) that are engineered to direct Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 cleavage against DNA loci that encode the stgRNAs, thus accumulating mutations at stgRNA loci as a record of stgRNA or Cas9 expression. RATIONALE The RNA-guided DNA endonuclease Cas9 introduces a double-stranded break in target DNA containing a 5′-NGG-3′ protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) and homology to the specificity-determining sequence (SDS) of a small guide RNA (sgRNA). Once a double-strand break is introduced, the targeted DNA can be repaired via error-prone DNA repair mechanisms in human cells. We hypothesized that if a PAM sequence were introduced in the DNA locus encoding the sgRNA, the transcribed sgRNA would direct Cas9 to cleave its own encoding DNA, thus acting as a stgRNA. After error-prone repair, the mutagenized stgRNA locus should continue to be transcribed and enact additional rounds of continuous, self-targeted mutagenesis. Thus, the stgRNA locus should acquire mutations corresponding to the level of activity of the Cas9-stgRNA complex. We hypothesized that by linking the expression of stgRNA or Cas9 to biological events of interest, one could then record the duration and/or intensity of such events in the form of accumulated mutations at the stgRNA locus. The recorded information could be read by sequencing the stgRNA locus or by other related strategies. RESULTS We first built a stgRNA by engineering a sgRNA-encoding DNA locus to contain a 5′-NGG-3′ PAM immediately downstream of the SDS-encoding region. We then validated that the stgRNA could undergo multiple rounds of self-targeted mutagenesis by building a mutation-based toggling reporter system in which the progressive accumulation of mutations at the stgRNA locus is reported by individual cells toggling between green and red fluorescent protein expression. Next, we analyzed the sequence-evolution properties of stgRNAs in order to devise a sequence-based recording metric that conveys information on the duration and/or magnitude of stgRNA activity. We showed that computationally designed stgRNAs that contain longer SDSs of length 30, 40, and 70 nucleotides are able to accumulate mutations over longer durations of time. We demonstrated the analog nature of mSCRIBE by building a tumor necrosis factor–α (TNFα)–inducible Cas9 expression system and observing graded increases in the recording metric as a function of increasing TNFα concentration and/or duration of exposure in vitro . By designing doxycycline and isopropyl-β- d thiogalactoside-inducible stgRNA expression systems, we also showed inducible, multiplexed recording at two independent DNA loci. Last, we confirmed that human cells containing TNFα-responsive mSCRIBE units can record lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–induced acute inflammation events over time in mice. CONCLUSION We demonstrate that sgRNAs can be engineered to function as stgRNAs. By linking stgRNA or Cas9 expression to specific biological events of interest—such as the presence of small molecules, exposure to TNFα, or LPS-induced inflammation—we validated mSCRIBE as an analog memory device that records information about the duration and/or magnitude of biological events. Moreover, we demonstrated that multiple biological events can be simultaneously monitored by using independent stgRNA loci. We envision that this platform for genomically encoded memory in human cells should be broadly useful for studying biological systems and longitudinal and dynamic events in vitro and in situ, such as signaling pathways, gene regulatory networks, and tissue heterogeneity involved in development, healthy cell function, and disease pathogenesis. Continuously evolving stgRNAs. The Cas9-stgRNA complex cleaves the DNA locus from which the stgRNA is transcribed, leading to error-prone DNA repair. Multiple rounds of transcription and DNA cleavage can occur, resulting in progressive mutagenesis of the DNA encoding the stgRNA. The accumulation of mutations in the stgRNA locus provides a molecular record of cellular events that regulate stgRNA or Cas9 expression."

https://openalex.org/W2508401215,"HIV-1–specific broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) can protect rhesus monkeys against simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) challenge. However, the site of antibody interception of virus and the mechanism of antibody-mediated protection remain unclear. We administered a fully protective dose of the bNAb PGT121 to rhesus monkeys and challenged them intravaginally with SHIV-SF162P3. In PGT121-treated animals, we detected low levels of viral RNA and viral DNA in distal tissues for seven days following challenge. Viral RNA–positive tissues showed transcriptomic changes indicative of innate immune activation, and cells from these tissues initiated infection after adoptive transfer into naïve hosts. These data demonstrate that bNAb-mediated protection against a mucosal virus challenge can involve clearance of infectious virus in distal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2509477627,"In many species, embryos can perceive and learn external sounds. Yet, the possibility that parents may use these embryonic capacities to alter their offspring's developmental trajectories has not been considered. Here, we demonstrate that zebra finch parents acoustically signal high ambient temperatures (above 26°C) to their embryos. We show that exposure of embryos to these acoustic cues alone adaptively alters subsequent nestling begging and growth in response to nest temperature and influences individuals' reproductive success and thermal preferences as adults. These findings have implications for our understanding of maternal effects, phenotypic plasticity, developmental programming, and the adaptation of endothermic species to a warming world."
https://openalex.org/W2516851670,"Erosion influences the dynamical evolution of mountains. However, evidence for the impact of surface processes on tectonics mostly relies on the circumstantial coincidence of rugged topography, high stream power, erosion, and rock uplift. Using the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) thermochronometry technique, we quantified the spatial and temporal exhumation of the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. We found increasing exhumation rates within the past million years at the northeast end of the Namche Barwa-Gyala Peri dome. These observations imply headward propagation of erosion in the Parlung River, suggesting that the locus of high exhumation has migrated northward. Although surface processes influence exhumation rates, they do not necessarily engage in a feedback that sets the location of tectonic deformation."
https://openalex.org/W2508146847,"The current study aimed to examine the short-term choroidal response to optical defocus in schoolchildren. Myopic schoolchildren aged 8-16 were randomly allocated to control group (CG), myopic defocus group (MDG) and hyperopic defocus group (HDG) (n = 17 per group). Children in MDG and HDG received additional +3D and -3D lenses, respectively, to their full corrections on the right eyes. Full correction was given to their left eyes, and on both eyes in the CG. Axial length (AXL) and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFChT) were then measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Children wore their group-specific correction for 2 hours after which any existing optical defocus was removed, and subjects wore full corrections for another 2 hours. Both the AXL and SFChT were recorded hourly for 4 hours. The mean refraction of all subjects was -3.41 ± 0.37D (± SEM). SFChT thinned when exposed to hyperopic defocus for 2 hours but less thinning was observed in response to myopic defocus compared to the control group (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA). Removal of optical defocus significantly decreased SFChT in the MDG and significantly increased SFChT in the HDG after 1 and 2 hours (mean percentage change at 2-hour; control vs. hyperopic defocus vs. myopic defocus; -0.33 ± 0.59% vs. 3.04 ± 0.60% vs. -1.34 ± 0.74%, p < 0.01). Our results showed short-term exposure to myopic defocus induced relative choroidal thickening while hyperopic defocus led to choroidal thinning in children. This rapid and reversible choroidal response may be an important clinical parameter in gauging retinal response to optical defocus in human myopia."
https://openalex.org/W2511504797,"Objectives Increased antibiotic resistance has catalyzed the research on new antibacterial molecules and alternative strategies, such as the application of beneficial bacteria. Since lectin molecules have unique sugar-recognizing capacities, and pathogens are often decorated with sugars that affect their survival and infectivity, we explored whether lectins from the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG have antipathogenic properties. Methods The genome sequence of L. rhamnosus GG was screened for the presence of lectin-like proteins. Two genes, LGG_RS02780 and LGG_RS02750, encoding for polypeptides with an N-terminal conserved L-type lectin domain were detected and designated Llp1 (lectin-like protein 1) and Llp2. The capacity of Llp1 and Llp2 to inhibit biofilm formation of various pathogens was investigated. Sugar specificity was determined by Sepharose beads assays and glycan array screening. Results The isolated lectin domains of Llp1 and Llp2 possess pronounced inhibitory activity against biofilm formation by various pathogens, including clinical Salmonella species and uropathogenic E. coli, with Llp2 being more active than Llp1. In addition, sugar binding assays with Llp1 and Llp2 indicate specificity for complex glycans. Both proteins are also involved in the adhesion capacity of L. rhamnosus GG to gastrointestinal and vaginal epithelial cells. Conclusions Lectins isolated from or expressed by beneficial lactobacilli could be considered promising bio-active ingredients for improved prophylaxis of urogenital and gastrointestinal infections."

So far, no in depth-study has been performed to systematically analyse the root causes of unplanned ICU-admissions. The primary aim of this study was to identify the healthcare worker-, organisational-, technical,- disease- and patient- related causes that contribute to acute unplanned ICU admissions from general wards using a Root-Cause Analysis Tool called PRISMA-medical. Although a Track and Trigger System (MEWS) was introduced in our hospital a few years ago, it was implemented without a clear protocol. Therefore, the secondary aim was to assess the adherence to a Track and Trigger system to identify deterioration on general hospital wards in patients eventually transferred to the ICU.Retrospective observational study in 49 consecutive adult patients acutely admitted to the Intensive Care Unit from a general nursing ward. 1. PRISMA-analysis on root causes of unplanned ICU admissions 2. Assessment of protocol adherence to the early warning score system.Out of 49 cases, 156 root causes were identified. The most frequent root causes were healthcare worker related (46%), which were mainly failures in monitoring the patient. They were followed by disease-related (45%), patient-related causes (7, 5%), and organisational root causes (3%). In only 40% of the patients vital parameters were monitored as was instructed by the doctor. 477 vital parameter sets were found in the 48 hours before ICU admission, in only 1% a correct MEWS was explicitly documented in the record.This in-depth analysis demonstrates that almost half of the unplanned ICU admissions from the general ward had healthcare worker related root causes, mostly due to monitoring failures in clinically deteriorating patients. In order to reduce unplanned ICU admissions, improving the monitoring of patients is therefore warranted."

Our data indicate that acetate metabolism may be a potential therapeutic target for BRAF mutant melanoma. Malignant cells undergo metabolic reprograming to fuel proliferation in a nutrient-limited environment. Tumor cells metabolize glucose in the presence of oxygen, a process known as the Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis (1.Vander Heiden M.G. Cantley L.C. Thompson C.B. Understanding the Warburg effect: the metabolic requirements of cell proliferation.Science. 2009; 324: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (10206) Google Scholar). The Warburg effect is generally considered as a metabolic hallmark of cancer (2.Semenza G.L. HIF-1 mediates metabolic responses to intratumoral hypoxia and oncogenic mutations.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 3664-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), yet therapeutic targeting of underlying pathways has remained challenging. For example, BRAF inhibitors are the first line therapy for treatment of patients with mutant BRAF-driven melanoma (3.Bollag G. Tsai J. Zhang J. Zhang C. Ibrahim P. Nolop K. Hirth P.

Although glutamine can synergize with glucose metabolism to support tumor cell proliferation, metabolic tracing studies in glucose-deprived cells revealed that an unknown source of carbon cooperated with glutamine in maintaining TCA cycle intermediates (7.Le A.

Collectively, these studies suggest that malignant cells rapidly adapt to nutrient limitation by resetting their metabolism to maintain cell proliferation, thus hampering effective treatments. Similar to DNA synthesis, energy production and lipid synthesis are crucial biochemical processes in rapidly dividing cancer cells. Acetyl-CoA, a mitochondrial metabolite responsible for the TCA cycle and energy production is also the primary substrate for lipid synthesis. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) plays a central role in mobilizing acetyl-CoA from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm.

Although ACSS1 knockdown cells showed reduced acetate uptake and cell growth similar to ACSS2 knockdown (17.Yun M. Bang S.H. Kim J.W. Park J.Y. Kim K.S. Lee J.D. The importance of acetyl coenzyme A synthetase for 11C-acetate uptake and cell survival in hepatocellular carcinoma.J. Nucl. Med. 2009; 50: 1222-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the role of ACSS1 is not well understood. Here we show that glucose-starved melanoma cells are highly dependent on acetate to sustain ATP levels, cell viability and proliferation. Conversely, depletion of ACSS1 or ACSS2 reduced melanoma tumor growth in mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate acetate metabolism as a liability in melanoma. A375, MEL 526, and MEL697 melanoma cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.3 g/liter l-glutamine (HyClone), 2 g/liter d-glucose (HyClone), and 10% FBS (Sigma) and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies). Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination with QuickTest Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Biotool). Antibodies to ACSS1 and ACSS2 were purchased from Proteintech (Cat. 171138-1-AP) and Cell Signaling (Cat. 3658), respectively. Rotenone and oligomycin A were purchased from Cayman Chemical Company, glyceryl triacetate (GTA) was purchased from ACROS Organics, and all other chemical compounds were purchased from Sigma. Rotenone and oligomycin A were reconstituted in DMSO and added to the cells at respective concentrations of 1 μm and 1 μm. Aqueous solutions of GTA, GTP, and GTB were added to the cells at final concentrations of 0.25% v/v. Cells were seeded at density of 8 × 103 cells per well of a 96-well plate (Greiner) in triplicates per condition in the RPMI 1640 medium (Biological Industries) and supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.3 g/liter l-glutamine (HyClone) and 2 g/liter d-glucose (Sigma) 12–16 h prior to initiation of starvation. Medium was then exchanged to basal RPMI 1640 medium containing defined supplements, metabolites, and/or pharmacologically active compounds for 30–36 h. As a source of acetate, 0.25% GTA was added to the defined medium. In the cases of sodium acetate and glycerol, to obtain equivalent amounts of of GTA, 35 mm sodium acetate (pH 7.0) and 12 mm glycerol was added to the conditioned medium. Viability was assayed using resazurin reagent (Biotium) in accordance with manufacturer's protocol. ATP was measured after 24–30 h of incubation in defined medium using CellTiter-Glo luminescent reagent (Promega). Fluorescent and luminescent signals were read on Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments). MEL697 cells were seeded into 24-well plates (Greiner) at density of 2 × 104 cells per well, in duplicates per condition, 12–16 h prior to experimentation. To measure cellular proliferation in defined medium, cells were grown in plain RPMI 1640 medium in the absence of FBS and supplemented with GTA, Gln, or both for 30 h. At this point, every 2 h cells from duplicate wells were gently scraped into the medium and counted using Countess Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen). MEL697 cells were seeded into 96 well plates at density of 8 × 103 cells per well in triplicates per condition in complete RPMI 1640 medium 12–16 h prior to experimentation. Medium was then exchanged to either the complete medium, or the defined RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0, 1, 5, or 10% FBS in the absence or presence of 0.3 g/L l-glutamine, 0.25% GTA, or both for 48 h. Viability was assessed by resazurin, subsequently cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, and the adherent cells were stained with 0.5% Crystal Violet. TRC lentiviral shRNA vectors were obtained from Sigma. The ACSS1 was targeted by clone TRCN0000045380 and ACSS2 with combination of TRCN0000045563, TRCN0000045565, TRCN0000045566, and TRCN0000045567. The control shRNA is the pLKO.1-TRC control (Addgene, plasmid 10879). Production of viral particles and transduction of target cells was conducted as described elsewhere. Gene expression changes were assessed by RT-qPCR as we previously reported (23.Lakhter A.J. Hamilton J. Dagher P.C. Mukkamala S. Hato T. Dong X.C. Mayo L.D. Harris R.A. Shekhar A. Ivan M.

Ferroxitosis: a cell death from modulation of oxidative phosphorylation and PKM2-dependent glycolysis in melanoma.Oncotarget. 2014; 5: 12694-12703Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), using the following primer sequences: ACSS1 forward, GTGCAGAGTCCTTGGCTGGG, ACSS1 reverse, TTCTTCAGCTCCACCACGCG, ACSS2 forward, CGAGGCCCTGCAGAAGTGTC, and ACSS2 reverse, GAGTCACCCATGCCGAGCTC. NOD/scid/IL2Rgnull (NSG) mice were bred at IU Simon Cancer Center In-Vivo Therapeutic Core facility. 8-week-old female animals were subcutaneously implanted with 1 million MEL526 cells that were lentivirally transduced to express shRNA hairpins against control, ACSS1, or ACSS2, in 100 μl serum free medium into the right hind flank. Xenograft size was measured three times a week with a digital caliper and the ellipsoidal tumor volumes were recorded. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the principles outlined in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Indiana University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of cultured cells was measured with an XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). Cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells per well. One day before the experiment cell culture medium was exchanged for freshly prepared RPMI 1640 medium supplemented either with 2 g/liter d-glucose, 0.25% GTA, or 0.3 g/liter l-glutamine, and 2% serum. After 16-h treatment course, measurements were performed at 37 °C in a bath solution of fresh RMPI medium supplemented as above. Following three baseline OCR measurements, wells were sequentially injected with 1 μm oligomycin A, 60 μm 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), and 1 μm rotenone + 1 μm antimycin A. Once injected, each compound was present in the bath medium for the duration of the experiment. Three OCR measurements were performed after each injection. To ensure that the culture maintained sufficient oxygenation, a 3-min mix, 2-min wait cycle occurred prior to each 3-min measurement. Unless stated otherwise, data presented are mean ± S.D. in triplicates per condition (n = 3). Statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism 5, with statistical significance determined by Holm-Sidak method. To gain insight into novel glucose-independent metabolic pathways that may support melanoma cell survival, we developed a starvation assay using RPMI medium lacking glucose and glutamine (defined medium), and by gradual reduction of serum concentrations to 0%. MEL697 melanoma cells harboring the BRAFV600E mutation are rapidly dividing cells that require constant supply of carbon (glucose) and nitrogen (glutamine) sources to support cell survival and proliferation. We exploited these features of MEL697 cells to develop glucose and serum starvation assay to study glucose-independent metabolic pathways. MEL697 were seeded in regular culture medium in a 96-well plate for 12–16 h. This regular medium was then replaced with defined medium containing glucose plus 10% serum or without glucose plus decreasing concentrations of serum from 10 to 0%. To this medium, glutamine (Gln) or GTA, or Gln plus GTA, was added as indicated (Fig. 1A). GTA, also known as triacetin has been used as a source of acetate for cancer cells, mice, and to treat infants with Canavan disease (24.Segel R. Anikster Y. Zevin S. Steinberg A. Gahl W.A. Fisher D. Staretz-Chacham O. Zimran A. Altarescu G. A safety trial of high dose glyceryl triacetate for Canavan disease.Mol. Genet.

To quantify glucose-independent acetate metabolism, we adopted an Almar Blue-based cell viability assay. The results indicated that in glucose-deprived cells, acetate or glutamine alone was not sufficient to maintain cell viability, whereas the combination of acetate and glutamine significantly restored the viability of melanoma cells (Fig. 1A). Subsequent to cell viability determinations, cells were subjected to formaldehyde fixation and stained with crystal violet to visualize the intact cells that adhered to the plate. Although cells exposed to 10% serum with glucose were stained with crystal violet, there was no staining of cells observed in the absence of glucose. Glutamine, even in the absence of glucose retained crystal violet staining in cells cultured up to 5% serum. GTA supplementation maintained crystal violet staining of cells in 10% serum even in the absence of glucose. Remarkably, consistent with the results of cell viability assays, cells cultured in GTA- and Gln-containing medium were positive for crystal violet stain even in the absence of serum and glucose (Fig. 1B). Since acetate supplementation cooperated with glutamine in restoring viability of cells in the absence of glucose, we asked if the combination of acetate and glutamine could support cell proliferation. MEL697 cells were plated in defined medium as indicated in Fig. 1, and 30 h postincubation in the defined medium, cell number counting revealed that the combination of acetate (GTA) and glutamine was sufficient to support cell proliferation even in the absence of glucose and serum (Fig. 1C). Cells incubated in the medium without serum, glutamine and glucose maintained cell growth using the nutrients that were left on the plate from the original medium in which cells were seeded. However, after 30 h of incubation in medium without serum, glutamine, and glucose led to steady decrease in cell number compared with cells incubated in complete medium (p < 0.001). Remarkably, even in the absence of glucose and serum, cells incubated in glutamine plus GTA sustained cell proliferation that was significantly higher than that of the cell growth in complete medium (p < 0.001). Percent change in cell number was also plotted (supplemental Fig. S1). Although BRAF mutation is observed in 50% of melanomas, nearly 20% of melanomas harbor mutations in NRAS and also there are cases where these genes are not mutated (26.Fedorenko I.V. Gibney G.T. Sondak V.K. Smalley K.S. Beyond BRAF: where next for melanoma therapy?.Br. J. Cancer. 2015; 112: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To test whether acetate has similar effects in NRAS-mutant and BRAF/NRAS-wild-type cells, MEL103 (NRASQ61R) and SKMEL23 (BRAF/NRAS wild-type) melanoma cells were subjected to the same starvation assay as described above. Glutamine supplementation was sufficient to restore viability in both MEL103 and SKMEL23 cells lines, and GTA supplementation did not improve the cell viability (Fig. 2). Consistent with the cell viability data, cell number counting in a short-term culture in the absence of glucose revealed that glutamine was sufficient to support proliferation of MEL103 and SKMEL23 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Having demonstrated that acetate could replace glucose as a carbon source in mutant BRAF but not in NRAS mutant or BRAF/NRAS-wild-type melanoma cells, we extended these observations to commonly used melanoma cell lines. A375 and MEL526 are BRAF mutant melanoma cells that are widely used to study melanoma biology (27.Maragos C.M. Wang J.M. Hrabie J.A. Oppenheim J.J. Keefer L.K.

Differential expression of MAGE-1, -2, and -3 messenger RNA in transformed and normal human cell lines.Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5-8PubMed Google Scholar). A375 and MEL526 were subjected to the defined medium as described above and cell viability was assessed. The results showed that glutamine supplementation was not sufficient to restore the viability but when combined with acetate, cell viability was restored significantly under glucose deprivation (Fig. 3A). To further substantiate these results, we measured ATP levels by luminescence-based assay. A375 and MEL526 cells were subjected to starvation conditions as described above and total ATP levels determined. GTA and glutamine together significantly restored ATP levels in the absence of glucose, recapitulating results of the cell viability data (Fig. 3B). Short chain fatty acid oxidation fuels energy production in cells. Acetate, propionate, and butyrate are two, three, and four carbon short chain fatty acids, respectively (Fig. 4A). GTA, glyceryl tripropionate (GTP), and glyceryl tributyrate (GTB) are metabolized by normal and tumor cells (25.Tsen A.R. Long P.M. Driscoll H.E. Davies M.T. Teasdale B.A. Penar P.L. Pendlebury W.W.

To test whether melanoma cells can utilize other short-chain fatty acids, or if the proliferative effects are limited to acetate, we performed cell viability assay for MEL526 and A375 cells in the presence of either GTA, GTP, or GTB in combination with glutamine. The observed effects of metabolic mediations that could support cell viability in the absence of glucose were limited to acetate (Fig. 4B). Because GTA metabolism can yield acetate and glycerol, to confirm the observed effects are due to acetate but not glycerol, we conducted cell viability assay in the presence of sodium acetate or glycerol. MEL526 and A375 cells were subjected to conditioned medium in the presence of acetate or glycerol. Similar to the effects of GTA, sodium acetate but not glycerol restored viability of cells in the absence of serum and glucose (supplemental Fig. S3) (p < 0.001). Our previous report (23.Lakhter A.J.

This led us to hypothesize that glucose-deprivation imposes oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-dependent acetate metabolism in melanoma cells. To test this, A375 and MEL526 cells were cultured in defined medium containing 10% serum with (pink bars) or without glucose (gray bars) in the presence of either glutamine, GTA, or a combination of both, and treated with OXPHOS inhibitors oligomycin A or rotenone (Fig. 5A). Although neither oligomycin A nor rotenone exposure was cytotoxic to melanoma cells in the presence of glucose, viability of A375 and MEL526 cells was dramatically decreased by these OXPHOS inhibitors in the absence of glucose.

https://openalex.org/W2512555639,"Abstract Macrophages are the predominant innate immune cells recruited to tissues following injury or infection. These early-responding, pro-inflammatory macrophages play an essential role in the amplification of inflammation. However, macrophage pro-inflammatory gene expression should be tightly regulated to avert host tissue damage. In this study, we identify the Kruppel-like transcription factor 6 (KLF6)-B cell leukemia/lymphoma 6 (BCL6) signaling axis as a novel regulator of macrophage inflammatory gene expression and function. Utilizing complementary gain- and loss-of-function studies, we observed that KLF6 is essential for macrophage motility under ex vivo and in vivo conditions. Concordant with these observations, myeloid-specific deficiency of KLF6 significantly attenuates macrophage pro-inflammatory gene expression, recruitment, and progression of inflammation. At the molecular level, KLF6 suppresses BCL6 mRNA and protein expression by elevating PR domain-containing 1 with ZNF domain (PRDM1) levels in macrophages. Interestingly, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of BCL6 in KLF6-deficient macrophages completely abrogated the attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression and cellular motility. Collectively, our observations reveal that KLF6 repress BCL6 to enhance macrophage inflammatory gene expression and function."
https://openalex.org/W2511863849,"Oncostatin M (OSM) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) are IL-6 family members with a wide range of biological functions. Human OSM (hOSM) and murine LIF (mLIF) act in mouse cells via a LIF receptor (LIFR)-glycoprotein 130 (gp130) heterodimer. In contrast, murine OSM (mOSM) signals mainly via an OSM receptor (OSMR)-gp130 heterodimer and binds with only very low affinity to mLIFR. hOSM and mLIF stimulate bone remodeling by both reducing osteocytic sclerostin and up-regulating the pro-osteoclastic factor receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) in osteoblasts. In the absence of OSMR, mOSM still strongly suppressed sclerostin and stimulated bone formation but did not induce RANKL, suggesting that intracellular signaling activated by the low affinity interaction of mOSM with mLIFR is different from the downstream effects when mLIF or hOSM interacts with the same receptor. Both STAT1 and STAT3 were activated by mOSM in wild type cells or by mLIF/hOSM in wild type and Osmr−/− cells. In contrast, in Osmr−/− primary osteocyte-like cells stimulated with mOSM (therefore acting through mLIFR), microarray expression profiling and Western blotting analysis identified preferential phosphorylation of STAT3 and induction of its target genes but not of STAT1 and its target genes; this correlated with reduced phosphorylation of both gp130 and LIFR. In a mouse model of spontaneous osteopenia caused by hyperactivation of STAT1/3 signaling downstream of gp130 (gp130Y757F/Y757F), STAT1 deletion rescued the osteopenic phenotype, indicating a beneficial effect of promoting STAT3 signaling over STAT1 downstream of gp130 in this low bone mass condition, and this may have therapeutic value."

Here, we use comprehensive biochemical and structural analyses to demonstrate that PTPRG·CNTN3–6 complexes share similar binding affinities and a conserved arrangement. Furthermore, as a first step to identifying PTPRG·CNTN complexes in vivo, we found that PTPRG and CNTN3 associate in the outer segments of mouse rod photoreceptor cells. In particular, PTPRG and CNTN3 form cis-complexes at the surface of photoreceptors yet interact in trans when expressed on the surfaces of apposing cells. Further structural analyses suggest that all CNTN ectodomains adopt a bent conformation and might lie parallel to the cell surface to accommodate these cis and trans binding modes.

The complex processes that shape the nervous system include the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of neural cells, axon guidance, and the formation of synapses. At the molecular level, these intricate processes rely on interactions between cell surface receptors coupled to intracellular downstream signaling networks. Such receptors might include cadherins, Ig superfamily proteins, neurexins, neuroligins, and leucine-rich repeat proteins as well as receptor tyrosine kinases and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) 4The abbreviations used are: RPTP, receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase; PTPRG and PTPRZ; protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G and Z, respectively; FN; fibronectin; CA, carbonic anhydrase-like; CNTN, contactin; GPI, glycophosphatidylinositol; ANOVA, analysis of variance; OS, outer segment; IS, inner segment; GCL, ganglion cell layer; PLA, proximity ligation assay; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; CNG, cyclic nucleotide-gated; PFA, paraformaldehyde; RMSD, root mean square deviation.

Members of the RPTP family typically combine large extracellular segments and intracellular phosphatase domains, which makes them ideally suited to coordinate cell adhesion and cell signaling. Among these, the homologous protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G (PTPRG) and protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z (PTPRZ) were among the first RPTPs identified in the nervous system, and their ectodomains are characterized by the presence of an inactive N-terminal carbonic anhydrase-like (CA) domain that mediates protein-protein interactions (Fig. 1A) (3Harroch S.

CNTNs are ubiquitously expressed in the nervous system and found predominantly on neurons. Over the years, CNTN3–6 have repeatedly been associated with the sensory circuitry. For example, CNTN3–5 are expressed in neuronal layers of chick embryo retinas (10Yamagata M. Sanes J.R.

However, the formation of complexes between PTPRG and CNTN3–6 has yet to be confirmed in vivo. This has hampered our ability to define the potential biological roles of PTPRG·CNTN complexes. Here, our crystallographic and biochemical analyses provide molecular insights into PTPRG·CNTN3 and PTPRG·CNTN6 complexes and indicate that PTPRG·CNTN complexes share a conserved arrangement. As a first step toward defining their potential physiological roles, we investigated the association of PTPRG and CNTN3 in mouse retinas. Notably, we identified PTPRG·CNTN3 complexes in the outer segments of adult mouse photoreceptors, suggesting that PTPRG·CNTN complexes form in vivo. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that the PTPRG·CNTN3 complex can form on the surface of a single photoreceptor cell, indicating that these two proteins form a cis-complex. This finding led us to consider the possibility that CNTNs might interact with PTPRG when expressed either on the same cell or on apposing cells. We thus wondered whether specific structural features in the extracellular regions of CNTNs could facilitate such interactions. Our crystallographic analyses indicate that the FN regions in CNTNs adopt a bent conformation that might place the ectodomains of CNTNs parallel to the cell surface, where they would bind to PTPRG in either cis or trans configurations. In a broader context, the sum of our analyses raises the possibility that PTPRG is a versatile signaling partner for CNTN3–6, possibly functioning as co-receptor when expressed on the same cell membrane and as a ligand when expressed on a distinct cell membrane. The results of previous affinity isolation assays using CNTN-transfected cells and a PTPRG resin suggested that the CA domain of PTPRG interacts with CNTN3–6, whereas the CA domain of the homologous PTPRZ interacts with CNTN1 only (7Bouyain S. Watkins D.J. The protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPRZ and PTPRG bind to distinct members of the contactin family of neural recognition molecules.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2443-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), yet it was important to test whether these interactions could occur on the surface of cells. We thus expressed the CA and FN domains of PTPRG as a fusion protein with human IgG Fc and applied it to HEK293 cells transfected with full-length CNTNs (Fig. 1, A and B). In these experiments, PTPRG-Fc fusion proteins bound to cells transfected with CNTN3–6 but not to cells transfected with CNTN1 or CNTN2, thus demonstrating that the ectodomain of PTPRG interacts specifically with CNTN3–6 expressed at the cell surface. An earlier crystal structure of PTPRG(CA) bound to domains Ig1–Ig4 of mouse CNTN4 made it possible to identify CNTN4 residues that mediate interactions with PTPRG (7Bouyain S. Watkins D.J. The protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPRZ and PTPRG bind to distinct members of the contactin family of neural recognition molecules.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2443-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses of CNTN3–6 indicate that these residues are strictly conserved, indicating that PTPRG·CNTN complexes may be arranged similarly. However, it remains unclear whether there might be quantitative differences among the interactions between PTPRG and full-length CNTN family members. To address this question, we designed a protein-protein binding assay utilizing AlphaScreen technology in which a luminescent signal is emitted when a biotinylated form of PTPRG(CA) attached to a donor bead associates with a full-length CNTN expressed as an Fc fusion protein bound to an acceptor bead (supplemental Fig. S1A) (17Tolbert W.D. Daugherty J. Gao C. Xie Q. Miranti C. Gherardi E. Vande Woude G. Xu H.E. A mechanistic basis for converting a receptor tyrosine kinase agonist to an antagonist.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 14592-14597Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The binding strength is measured indirectly in a competitive-binding assay format whereby a soluble form of PTPRG(CA) inhibits the interactions between the proteins immobilized on the beads (Fig. 1C and supplemental Table S1). The assays are thus conducted with a truncated PTPRG and dimerized CNTNs so that the IC50 values obtained are appropriate for comparing binding between PTPRG and CNTNs but might not, however, reflect the true binding constants between PTPRG and CNTNs expressed at the cell surface. Under these conditions, the IC50 values for PTPRG/CNTN interactions range from 235 nm (PTPRG/CNTN4) to 519 nm (PTPRG/CNTN6) and are similar to the IC50 value of 332 nm obtained for PTPRZ/CNTN1 (supplemental Fig. S1B and Table S1). One-way ANOVA statistics indicated that only IC50 differences measured for CNTN4 versus CNTN3 or CNTN6 and for CNTN5 versus CNTN6 were statistically significant (Fig. 1D). However, it remains unclear whether these variations in binding affinities are significant enough to suggest differences in the physiological roles of PTPRG·CNTN complexes. Previous work had demonstrated that the minimal PTPRG-binding site on CNTN3–6 comprises domains Ig2-Ig3 (7Bouyain S. Watkins D.J. The protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPRZ and PTPRG bind to distinct members of the contactin family of neural recognition molecules.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2443-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Given the high level of sequence identity among CNTN3–6, we wondered whether there could remain differences in the details of the interactions between PTPRG and CNTN3–6. We addressed this by determining the co-crystal structures of PTPRG(CA) bound to the Ig2-Ig3 segments of CNTN3 and CNTN6 (Table 1 and Fig. 2, A and B). Overall, the crystal structures of the PTPRG·CNTN3 and PTPRG·CNTN6 complexes are similar to the structures of the PTPRG·CNTN4 and PTPRZ·CNTN1 complexes (5Lamprianou S. Chatzopoulou E. Thomas J.-L.

The binding site includes a β-hairpin loop (residues 288–301) that contacts both Ig2 and Ig3 domains and a short stretch (residues 225–229) that interacts only with Ig3 (Fig. 2). The interface areas and shape complementarity coefficients are 1,668 Å2/0.62 for the PTPRG·CNTN3 complex and 1,446 Å2/0.68 for the PTPRG·CNTN6 complex. These values are comparable with the published values for the PTPRG·CNTN4 and PTPRZ·CNTN1 complexes. Overall, these analyses indicate that the complexes of PTPRG and PTPRZ bound to their cognate CNTN partners share a conserved arrangement with one another.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsCNTN3(Ig2-Ig3)·PTPRG(CA)CNTN6(Ig2-Ig3)·PTPRG(CA)CNTN5(Ig1–Ig4)CNTN1 (FN1–FN3)SeCNTN2 (FN1–FN3)CNTN2 (FN1–FN3)CNTN3 (FN1-FN3)CNTN3 (Ig5-FN2)CNTN4 (FN1–FN3)CNTN5 (FN1–FN3)CNTN6 (FN1–FN3)Data collectionBeamlineAPS 22-IDAPS 22-BMAPS 22-BMAPS 22-IDAPS 22-BMAPS 22-IDAPS 22-IDAPS 22-BMAPS 22-BMAPS 22-IDAPS 22-IDWavelength (Å)1.01.01.01.00.979161.01.01.00.979331.01.0Unique reflections31,16670,48214,07048,70149,12128,3578,97620,57813,38714,28521,656Resolution (Å)50–2.650–2.050–2.650–2.550–1.830–2.050–2.850–2.450–2.550–2.750–2.7Space groupP21212P212121C2P21P21212P21212C2P212121C2221C2221P212121Unit cella, b, c (Å)74.14, 90.53, 147.4578.64, 113.53, 117.05179.98, 50.66, 51.0287.48, 49.87, 163.30124.82, 40.85, 83.11124.39, 40.67, 82.60185.10, 39.03, 52.4058.22, 76.93, 115.8294.79, 144.3, 55.4083.77, 154.52, 90.4286.74, 90.85, 99.35α, β, γ (degrees)90.0, 90.0, 90.090.0, 90.0, 90.090.0, 101.67, 90.090.0, 97.12, 90.090.0, 90.0, 90.090.0, 90.0, 90.090.0, 96.9, 90.090.0, 90.0, 90.090.0, 90.0, 90.090.0, 90.0, 90.090.0, 90.0, 90.0RsymaRsym = Σh Σi|Ii(h) − 〈I(h)〉|/Σh Σi Ii(h), where Ii(h) is the ith measurement of reflection h and 〈I(h)〉 is a weighted mean of all measurements of h.0.134 (0.588)bValues in parentheses apply to the high resolution shell.0.096 (0.593)0.154 (0.435)0.075 (0.380)0.082 (0.479)0.110 (0.508)0.139 (0.377)0.165 (0.548)0.08 (0.460)0.112 (0.418)0.155 (0.515)CompletenessbValues in parentheses apply to the high resolution shell.

Rwork and Rfree were calculated from the working and test reflection sets, respectively. Open table in a new tab Broadly, interfaces for the PTPRG·CNTN complexes can be divided into four parts (Fig. 3, A–D): 1) a predominantly hydrophobic site that comprises residues on the base of the PTPRG(CA) β-hairpin loop; 2) a 5-amino acid stretch interacting with corresponding residues in the Ig3 domain of CNTN3/6; 3) an antiparallel β-sheet formed by the β-hairpin loop and an antiparallel three-strand β-sheet in domain Ig2 of CNTN3/6; and 4) the tip of the β-hairpin loop formed by residues Gln293–Val296 that interacts with domain Ig2 of CNTN3/6. In the PTPRG·CNTN3/6 complexes, site 1 is formed by PTPRG residues Phe288, Thr289, Thr290, and Tyr301 and CNTN3/6 residues Met222 and Tyr225. Site 2 includes residues Val225-Lys229 in PTPRG and residues Glu226, Pro227, Lys228, and Asn306 in CNTN3/6. In site 3, the combined 5-strand antiparallel β-sheet is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the main chain atoms of His295–Glu300 in PTPRG and Gly139–Leu143 in CNTN3/6. In addition, the side chain of CNTN3/6 Gln138 side chain forms two hydrogen bonds with the main chain atoms of Val299 and side chain atoms of Glu300 in PTPRG. Finally, in site 4, the tip of the PTPRG(CA) β-hairpin loop rests against the Ig2 domain of CNTN3/6, and the side chain of His295 packs against Arg129 in particular. Although the contacts found at sites 1–3 are conserved in all PTPRG·CNTN structures, the side chains of residues Gln293, Asp294, His295, and Val296 in site 4 adopt distinct conformations (Fig. 3D), which suggests that this region is flexible and might only play a minor role in mediating protein-protein interactions. The conserved contacts at the interfaces of complexes formed by PTPRG with CNTN3, -4, and -6 (Fig. 3E) are consistent with the comparable IC50 values determined in our binding assays (Fig. 1, C and D). Finally, it was not possible to obtain co-crystals of PTPRG and CNTN5, but comparison of the PTPRG-binding site in CNTN4 and the corresponding region in CNTN5 shows that they are essentially identical (Fig. 3F). This finding, along with the similar affinities between PTPRG(CA) and CNTN3–6, strongly suggests that the binding mode observed for PTPRG(CA) and CNTN3, -4, and -6 is conserved for PTPRG and CNTN5. Although most of the interactions between PTPRG and its cognate CNTN partners are mediated by the β-hairpin loop in the CA domain of PTPRG (Fig. 3), comparison of the complexes PTPRG forms with CNTN3, -4, and -6 indicates that the tip of the loop adopts distinct conformations, arguing that it might not mediate essential contacts (Fig. 3E). We designed three mutant forms of the CA domain of mouse PTPRG to define the contribution of each region to the complex formation (Fig. 4A): 1) a deletion mutant in which sites 3 and 4 are eliminated as residues 290–299 of the β-hairpin loop are replaced by the tripeptide ASA; 2) a form including the mutations H295A/V296A at the tip of the β-hairpin in site 4; and 3) a form that includes two alanine mutations in the short loop in site 2 (H226A/K229A). All proteins behaved comparably with wild-type PTPRG(CA) and in particular were monomeric as determined by size exclusion chromatography. Furthermore, the structural integrity of the two alanine site-directed mutants was verified by circular dichroism spectropolarimetry, which indicates that the mutations did not alter the secondary structures of these mutated domains (supplemental Fig. S2). Because our analyses strongly suggest that all PTPRG·CNTN complexes share a similar binding mode, the binding activities of these mutant proteins were only tested for CNTN4 (Fig. 4B). The β-hairpin deletion mutant did not inhibit the interaction between PTPRG(CA) and an IgG Fc fusion of mouse CNTN4, which mirrors the effect of the β-hairpin deletion on the binding of PTPRZ and CNTN1 (5Lamprianou S. Chatzopoulou E. Thomas J.-L. Bouyain S. Harroch S. A complex between contactin-1 and the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPRZ controls the development of oligodendrocyte precursor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 17498-17503Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mutations H295A/V296A only increased the IC50 by ∼4-fold, consistent with our observation that contacts in site 4 might not be essential for complex formation. The decrease in binding may result from the loss of the hydrophobic Val296 side chain, which interacts with CNTN Leu142 and Val132 in CNTN3, -4, and -6. Removing the His295 side chain prevents van der Waals contacts with the side chain atoms of Arg129 and Cys144. However, one expects that the substitution to alanine residues would preserve the main chain interactions, including formation of the five-strand antiparallel β-sheet (Fig. 2C). Finally, mutating His226 and Lys229 to alanine abolished the CNTN4 binding activity (Fig. 4B). Indeed, His226 mediates conserved non-polar interaction with Tyr225, Pro227, and Lys228 and a hydrogen bond with the main-chain oxygen atom of Glu298. Substituting Lys229 to alanine disrupts the Lys229-Glu226 salt bridge and the Lys229-Asn306 hydrogen bond (Fig. 3, B and D). Overall, these results confirm the importance of the β-hairpin loop in complex formation but also indicate that contacts located in site 2 mediate essential interactions at the interface. Despite strong lines of evidence that PTPRG interacts specifically with CNTN3–6 in vitro, the identification of such complexes in vivo has yet to be investigated thoroughly. This question was addressed in mouse retinas, where PTPRG and CNTN3–5 are expressed (10Yamagata M. Sanes J.R.

Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases are expressed by cycling retinal progenitor cells and involved in neuronal development of mouse retina.Neuroscience. 2008; 152: 618-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In simple terms, the retina includes three major neuronal layers (Fig. 5A). Light is first detected by photopigments in the outer segments of rod and cone photoreceptor cells spanning the outer segment (OS), inner segment (IS), and outer nuclear layer. Information is then transmitted to the bipolar cells found in the inner nuclear layer and then to ganglion cells in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) before being sent to the visual cortex by the optic nerve. The outer plexiform layer and inner plexiform layer include synapses between the photoreceptors and bipolar cells and between the bipolar cells and ganglion cells, respectively. As a first step, we analyzed the distribution of PTPRG and CNTN3 by immunohistochemistry using antibodies from commercial sources that we validated in our laboratory (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). Consistent with previous findings (16Horvat-Bröcker A. Reinhard J. Illes S. Paech T. Zoidl G. Harroch S. Distler C. Knyazev P. Ullrich A. Faissner A. Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases are expressed by cycling retinal progenitor cells and involved in neuronal development of mouse retina.Neuroscience. 2008; 152: 618-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), a strong signal could be observed for PTPRG in the OSs, ISs, inner plexiform layer, and GCL. By contrast, CNTN3 was mostly localized to the OS, where it overlapped with PTPRG (Fig. 5B). We decided to assess whether PTPRG and CNTN3 form complexes in the OS by using an in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) (18Söderberg O. Gullberg M. Jarvius M. Ridderstråle K. Leuchowius K.-J.

In these experiments, we detected the interaction of endogenous PTPRG and CNTN3 in vivo by using antibodies to determine whether these proteins are in close proximity with one another (<40 nm). Consistent with our immunohistochemistry experiments, a strong signal was observed in the OS of the photoreceptors, suggesting that PTPRG and CNTN3 form a complex in photoreceptors (Fig. 5C). In contrast, no signal was observed when the primary antibody against CNTN3 was omitted (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, we observed PLA spots in the OS when we conducted assays using a distinct PTPRG antibody raised against its CA domain, which confirms the specificity of the interactions identified between CNTN3 and PTPRG (supplemental Fig. S4).

We aimed to replicate important findings about a recently described third type of specific autoantibodies, anti-carbamylated protein (anti-CarP) antibodies, because they have been described based only in the homemade ELISA from a single laboratory. Our study included 520 patients with established RA and 278 healthy controls of Spanish ancestry and it was done with an independently performed ELISA. The prevalence and pattern of environmental, clinical and genetic associations of the anti-CarP antibodies were similar to the previously described. Notably, the presence and titers of anti-CarP correlated with the presence and titers of ACPA, but the anti-CarP antibodies did not share the known genetic and exposure risk factors of the ACPA. In addition, anti-CarP antibodies were independently associated with a higher (10.5%) prevalence of bone erosions. The reproducibility of these characteristics across laboratories and European subpopulations, indicates the wide validity of the results and suggests that determination of anti-CarP antibodies could contribute to explain RA pathogenesis and identify clinically relevant patient subgroups."
https://openalex.org/W2508263135,"The ability of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to accurately determine the concentrations of amplifiable targets makes it a promising platform for measuring copy number alterations (CNAs) in genomic biomarkers. However, its application to clinical samples, particularly formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens, will require strategies to reliably determine CNAs in DNA of limited quantity and quality. When applied to cancerous tissue, those methods must also account for global genetic instability and the associated probability that the abundance(s) of one or more chosen reference loci do not represent the average ploidy of cells comprising the specimen. Here we present an experimental design strategy and associated data analysis tool that enables accurate determination of CNAs in a panel of biomarkers using multiplexed ddPCR. The method includes strategies to optimize primer and probes design to cleanly segregate droplets in the data output from reaction wells amplifying multiple independent templates, and to correct for bias from artifacts such as DNA fragmentation. We demonstrate how a panel of reference loci can be used to determine a stable CNA-neutral benchmark. These innovations, when taken together, provide a comprehensive strategy that can be used to reliably detect biomarker CNAs in DNA extracted from either frozen or FFPE tissue biopsies."
https://openalex.org/W2511330973,"Well-powered genomic studies require genome-wide marker coverage across many individuals. For non-model species with few genomic resources, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods, such as Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS), offer an inexpensive alternative to array-based genotyping. Although affordable, datasets derived from HTS methods suffer from sequencing error, alignment errors, and missing data, all of which introduce noise and uncertainty to variant discovery and genotype calling. Under such circumstances, meaningful analysis of the data is difficult. Our primary interest lies in the issue of how one can accurately infer or impute missing genotypes in HTS-derived datasets. Many of the existing genotype imputation algorithms and software packages were primarily developed by and optimized for the human genetics community, a field where a complete and accurate reference genome has been constructed and SNP arrays have, in large part, been the common genotyping platform. We set out to answer two questions: 1) can we use existing imputation methods developed by the human genetics community to impute missing genotypes in datasets derived from non-human species and 2) are these methods, which were developed and optimized to impute ascertained variants, amenable for imputation of missing genotypes at HTS-derived variants? We selected Beagle v.4, a widely used algorithm within the human genetics community with reportedly high accuracy, to serve as our imputation contender. We performed a series of cross-validation experiments, using GBS data collected from the species Manihot esculenta by the Next Generation (NEXTGEN) Cassava Breeding Project. NEXTGEN currently imputes missing genotypes in their datasets using a LASSO-penalized, linear regression method (denoted 'glmnet'). We selected glmnet to serve as a benchmark imputation method for this reason. We obtained estimates of imputation accuracy by masking a subset of observed genotypes, imputing, and calculating the sample Pearson correlation between observed and imputed genotype dosages at the site and individual level; computation time served as a second metric for comparison. We then set out to examine factors affecting imputation accuracy, such as levels of missing data, read depth, minor allele frequency (MAF), and reference panel composition."

VHH single-domain antibodies have been demonstrated to neutralize diverse bacterial toxins both in vitro and in vivo, with protein properties such as small size and high stability that make them attractive therapeutic candidates. Recently, we reported on VHHs with in vivo activity against the protective antigen component of the anthrax toxins. Here, we characterized a new set of 15 VHHs against the anthrax toxins that act by binding to the edema factor (EF) and/or lethal factor (LF) components. Six of these VHHs are cross-reactive against both EF and LF and recognize the N-terminal domain (LFN, EFN) of their target(s) with subnanomolar affinity. The cross-reactive VHHs block binding of EF/LF to the protective antigen C-terminal binding interface, preventing toxin entry into the cell. Another VHH appears to recognize the LF C-terminal domain and exhibits a kinetic effect on substrate cleavage by LF. A subset of the VHHs neutralized against EF and/or LF in murine macrophage assays, and the neutralizing VHHs that were tested improved survival of mice in a spore model of anthrax infection. Finally, a bispecific VNA (VHH-based neutralizing agent) consisting of two linked toxin-neutralizing VHHs, JMN-D10 and JMO-G1, was fully protective against lethal anthrax spore infection in mice as a single dose.

Anthrax is a frequently fatal disease caused by the Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Central to the development of anthrax signs and symptoms in the host is the bacterium's production of two toxins, edema toxin (ET) 2The abbreviations used are: ET, edema toxin; LT, lethal toxin; EF, edema factor; PA, protective antigen; LF, lethal factor; VHH, variable domains of camelid heavy chain-only antibody; VNA, VHH-based neutralizing agent/heteromultimer of neutralizing VHHs; Tm, melting temperature; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; SC, subcutaneous. and lethal toxin (LT). ET comprises edema factor (EF) and protective antigen (PA), whereas LT comprises lethal factor (LF) and PA. In each case, PA binds to cell surface receptors and allows entry of the toxin to the cell via the formation of a pore. After binding to the receptor, PA is cleaved from the PA83 (83 kDa) to the PA63 (63 kDa) form by cell-surface proteases, leading to PA oligomerization and the formation of binding sites for LF/EF. Upon entry into the cell, EF is toxic via activity as an adenylate cyclase, whereas LF is toxic via activity as a zinc-dependent metalloprotease that cleaves mitogen-activated protein kinases (MEKs) (for review, see Ref. 1Moayeri M.

The development of antibody-based therapeutics against the anthrax toxins provides a means of neutralizing the toxicity and lethality of ET and LT. Many existing antibodies block the binding of PA to cellular receptors, thus preventing entry of the toxins into the cell (2Chen Z. Moayeri M. Purcell R. Monoclonal antibody therapies against anthrax.Toxins. 2011; 3: 1004-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).

VHHs consist of the 15-kDa variable domain from heavy chain-only antibodies that occur naturally in camelid species (e.g. camels, llamas, alpacas) and include the complete binding site for an epitope without the need for a separate light chain. The small size and single-chain nature of VHHs allow efficient production from bacteria as well as access to epitopes and protein regions that may not be accessible to conventional antibodies. VHHs also have higher stability to pH and temperature extremes than conventional antibodies (4Muyldermans S. Nanobodies: natural single-domain antibodies.Annu. Rev.

In the case of PA, we showed that two linked VHHs targeting different neutralizing epitopes provided strong protection against anthrax infection in mice (3Moayeri M. Leysath C.E. Tremblay J.M.

Here we report the characterization of a set of VHHs against the EF and/or LF components of the anthrax toxins. Toxin-neutralizing VHHs with nanomolar range IC50 values were identified that recognize various epitopes in either or both toxins. A subset of these VHHs cross-react against an epitope in the homologous N terminus of both toxins in a region responsible for association with PA. Other VHHs selectively neutralize LF or EF, including one VHH that appears to bind the C terminus of LF. We demonstrate therapeutic effectiveness of these agents in a spore model of anthrax in mice and discuss the potential for enhanced therapeutics that combine these EF/LF-neutralizing VHHs with anti-PA VHHs. To identify a pool of VHHs that bind to EF and/or LF, two alpacas were immunized with purified toxin proteins, and a phage display library prepared from the immune B cells was separately panned for phage binding to each protein. VHHs from clones of interest were re-expressed in Escherichia coli as fusions to thioredoxin, and the soluble products were purified for further in vitro characterization. VHH sequences are depicted in supplemental Fig. S1. First, the series of purified VHHs was screened for binding to EF and LF by dilution ELISA. Based on the results of these assays, VHHs were divided into three categories: EF-specific, LF-specific, and cross-specific for both EF and LF (Table 1, EC50 columns). As EF and LF must bind to PA63 to gain entry to the cell, the proteins share sequence similarity in their N-terminal PA binding domains (supplemental Fig. S2; potential shared epitopes in the N terminus highlighted with dark blue bars). Therefore, cross-specific VHHs would be expected to recognize one of these shared sequence stretches.TABLE 1Properties of anti-EF, anti-LF, and anti-EF/LF VHHsVHH NamePlasmidCompetition groupaGroup identification determined by competition ELISAs, as depicted in Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S4.

Open table in a new tab To aid in the selection of therapeutic candidates, each VHH was further characterized for its potency in neutralizing LF in a standard macrophage toxicity assay and in neutralizing EF in a cAMP production assay (Table 1, IC50 columns; representative results in Fig. 1, A–D). The two EF-specific VHHs, JMN-E2 and JMN-F3, exhibited little to no EF or LF neutralizing potency. Three of the seven LF-specific VHHs, JMO-B9, JMO-C9, and JMO-C10, potently neutralized LF while, as expected from the ELISA results, exhibiting no activity on EF. Most of the EF/LF cross-specific VHHs neutralized both EF and LF, with varying potencies. EF and LF binding as assessed by ELISA (EC50 values) did not always correlate with toxin neutralizing potency, as evidenced by the differences in EF binding versus EF neutralization observed for JMO-A4 (Table 1). Next, VHHs were placed into competition groups based on sandwich ELISA data (Table 1; ELISA schematic in supplemental Fig. S3). In these studies (Fig. 2), each of the VHHs was assessed as both a test agent and as a blocking agent in combination with each other VHHs recognizing the EF or LF targets. Based on the sandwich ELISA results, the two EF-specific VHHs recognize distinct, non-competing epitopes (EF1 and EF2). Although the EF/LF cross-specific VHHs vary significantly in their relative EC50 and IC50 values for EF and LF, all six are in the same competition group for both EF binding (Fig. 2A) and LF binding (Fig. 2B), which we named EF1/LF1. Presumably, the epitope recognized by the EF1/LF1 group is within a region of conserved sequence between the EF and LF proteins. Surprisingly, the EF-specific JMN-F3 (as well as the LF-specific JMO-C9, described below) is in the same competition group as the EF/LF cross-specific VHHs. We propose that this is due to partially overlapping epitopes within the same competition group. Within the EF1 group, JMN-D10, JMO-G1, and JMO-A4 exhibited the best ability to block EF binding by other members of the group when added as the blocking VHH. However, JMO-A4 is not a good therapeutic candidate due to its poor neutralizing ability (IC50 value, Table 1). Within the LF1 group, JMN-F1, JMO-B3, and JMO-G1 were all excellent blocking antibodies in the sandwich ELISA (Fig. 2B). In Fig. 2 it is evident that some VHHs exhibited weak or no self-competition in the sandwich assay. The VHHs with the highest apparent target affinities (lowest EC50) were typically the most potent blocking agents within their competition group, especially in the case of LF binding, suggesting that weak competition was a result of weak binding affinity. Therefore, to complete the LF epitope mapping, we performed a modified version of the sandwich assay that was less sensitive to VHH affinity on a subset of the VHHs (supplemental Fig. S4). Based on the data in Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S4, at least three non-overlapping LF epitopes are recognized by the set of VHHs (LF1, LF2, and LF3). VHHs binding to each of these LF epitopes were toxin-neutralizing (Fig. 1). JMO-A2 and JMO-C1 bound well to LF coated on plastic (with a high affinity in the case of JMO-A2 in particular; EC50 = 0.8 nm). However, JMO-A2 bound LF poorly in the sandwich ELISAs, both as the blocking antibody and as a test antibody. When applied to a plate coated with LF, JMO-A2 (but not JMO-G1 or JMO-B9) inhibited the binding of subsequently added JMO-A2 or JMO-C1 ≈2-fold; therefore, we placed these two antibodies into a final, non-neutralizing competition group, LF4. Based on our ELISA and toxin neutralization results, four VHHs were selected for further analysis. JMO-G1 was selected as the most potent cross-neutralizer in the EF1/LF1 group; JMN-D10 was selected for its excellent EF binding and neutralization capabilities; JMO-B3 was selected as being distinct in properties from the rest of the EF1/LF1 group, possibly suggesting a partially different epitope; JMO-B9 was selected as a good LF neutralizer within a different LF epitope group (LF2). All four of these selected VHHs were highly stable, as assessed by nanoscale differential scanning fluorimetry (ranging from 67–75 °C; Table 2). JMO-G1 exhibited the highest Tm (highest stability) of the set.TABLE 2Biochemical properties of a selected set of VHHsVHHTmKd, EFka, EFKD, EFkd, LFka, LFKD, LF°CmJMN-D1065.7 °C(1.3 ± 0.5) × 10−5(3.9 ± 1.2) × 105(1.6 ± 0.2) × 10−11(5.4 ± 2.2) × 10−4(1.5 ± 0.3) × 106(1.6 ± 0.2) × 10−9JMO-B369.8 °CNo bindingNo bindingNo binding(7.6 ± 0.5) × 10−6(7.7 ± 1.5) × 105(2.0 ± 0.5) × 10−11JMO-B966.6 °CNo bindingNo bindingNo bindingJMO-G175.3 °C(1.5 ± 0.3) × 10−5(6.6 ± 0.3) × 105(2.2 ± 0.4) × 10−11(6.6 ± 3.0) × 10−6(5.5 ± 0.6) × 105(1.1 ± 0.5) × 10−11 Open table in a new tab In a screen of VHH KD values by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at a VHH concentration of ≈100 nm, we observed that JMO-B3 and JMO-G1 had subnanomolar affinity for LF, and JMN-D10 and JMO-G1 had subnanomolar affinity for EF (Fig. 3; Table 2). JMO-B3 did not exhibit any appreciable binding to EF by SPR at 100 nm, consistent with its ELISA binding behavior. JMO-B9 did not exhibit binding to LF by SPR at 100 nm (data not shown) despite its tight binding indicated in ELISA binding and competition studies and its potent LF neutralization; we suggest that its binding mode to LF is not compatible with the orientation or conformation of the LF on the SPR chip. Based on the SPR results, the poor EC50 and IC50 values of JMN-D10 for LF may be related to its comparatively rapid dissociation rate from LF (kd column, Table 2). Although three of the VHHs in the selected subset share the same competition group, they are distinct in their binding and/or neutralization properties. This suggests that the antibodies recognize overlapping or contiguous, but not matching, epitopes, and/or that they differ in the kinetics of epitope binding to their paratopes. Therefore, we examined the locations and nature of each of the epitopes. We started by characterizing the binding of each of the VHHs in our experimental subset to the different domains of the LF protein (Fig. 4A). The LFN domain represents the N-terminal 263 amino acids of the 809 amino acid LF protein (Fig. 4A, red) and is the domain responsible for interaction with PA (Fig. 4B). The EF1/LF1 family binds to both LFN and LF by ELISA, confirming that these VHHs recognize an epitope(s) in the N terminus (Fig. 4D; supplemental Fig. S5A). In contrast, JMO-B9 binds to LF but not LFN (Fig. 4C; supplemental Fig. S5A). Therefore, JMO-B9 likely recognizes an epitope in the C terminus of LF. Alternatively, it may recognize a conformational epitope that is no longer present in recombinant LFN. LFN docks to PA at two separate sites: at the α-clamp, involving an interaction between the first 36 amino acids of LFN and the N terminus of PA, and at the C-terminal PA subsite (10Feld G.K. Thoren K.L. Kintzer A.F. Sterling H.J. Tang I.I. Greenberg S.G. Williams E.R. Krantz B.A. Structural basis for the unfolding of anthrax lethal factor by protective antigen oligomers.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We characterized the interaction between JMN-D10, JMO-B3, or JMO-G1 (EF1/LF1 family) and a Δ1–36 LF deletion construct. Binding was retained as assessed by ELISA (supplemental Fig. S5, B and C), indicating that the cross-neutralizing VHHs do not neutralize by blocking the interaction between LF and the PA α-clamp binding subsite and instead block binding to the PA C-terminal site. For finer mapping, Thullier et al. (11Thullier P. Avril A. Mathieu J. Behrens C.K. Pellequer J.L. Pelat T. Mapping the epitopes of a neutralizing antibody fragment directed against the lethal factor of Bacillus anthracis and cross-reacting with the homologous edema factor.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e65855Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) previously exploited the same observation of cross-reaction between EF and LF to map the epitopes of a different neutralizing antibody within LFN. The authors combined an LFN/EFN sequence alignment with a solvent exposure analysis to predict a series of potential cross-reactive epitopes: LF(97–103), LF(136–143), LF(178–184), LF(227–231), and LF(231–236). As a means of examining whether the epitopes for our VHH subset fall within any of these locations, as depicted on the structure of LF (Fig. 4B), we synthesized a set of linear peptides with sequences matching each of these five regions on LFN (supplemental Table S1). With the exception of peptide LF1, each of the peptides comprises residues that are located within the second LFN-PA binding cleft (as determined by the co-crystal structure; Fig. 4B). Although in general VHHs are expected to recognize conformational epitopes, we did observe some reactivity of LF and EF in a Western blot probed with VHHs from the EF1/LF1 competition group (Fig. 4E), suggesting that these VHHs retain some recognition of the denatured forms of the epitopes. However, when used in direct binding ELISA (with coating of biotinylated peptides to a streptavidin plate, probed with the VHHs), none of the VHHs in our subset demonstrated evidence of peptide binding as compared with a biotinylated full-length LF control (data not shown). Additionally, pre-binding of the peptides to the VHHs did not reduce the level of binding to an ELISA plate coated with full-length LF (Fig. 4F). Other residues on the solvent-exposed surface of LFN remain as potential epitope binding sites, including LF residues in the range of 188–225 (another component of the second PA-LFN binding cleft; Ref. 10Feld G.K. Thoren K.L. Kintzer A.F. Sterling H.J. Tang I.I. Greenberg S.G. Williams E.R. Krantz B.A. Structural basis for the unfolding of anthrax lethal factor by protective antigen oligomers.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the VHHs may not effectively recognize these short linear peptides. Finally, we compared the epitope recognized by EF1/LF1 to the epitope(s) recognized by two anti-EF monoclonal antibodies that were previously described as binding to the N terminus of EF (12Leysath C.E. Chen K.H. Moayeri M. Crown D. Fattah R. Chen Z. Das S.R. Purcell R.H. Leppla S.H. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to anthrax edema factor protect against infection.Infect. Immun. 2011; 79: 4609-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar): 4A6 and 7F10. In the sandwich ELISA described above, no competition was observed (including between 4A6 and 7F10), indicating the presence of three distinct epitopes with neutralizing potential in the EF N terminus (data not shown). The data from the epitope mapping experiments suggest that the mode of action for toxin neutralization by VHHs in the EF1/LF1 competition group is a hindrance of the binding of EF/LF to PA63, which prevents formation of the complete ET and LT toxins on the cell surface. ELISAs were performed to determine whether preincubation of LF and EF with the VHHs can inhibit toxin binding to PA63 oligomer (Fig. 5A). Consistent with the cell-based neutralization assays (Fig. 1; Table 1), JMN-D10 inhibited EF but not LF binding, JMO-B3 inhibited LF but not EF binding, and JMO-G1 inhibited both EF and LF binding to PA63 (Fig. 5B). JMO-B9, the LF-specific antibody in the distinct LF2 neutralization group, did not inhibit PA63 binding to either toxin, suggesting that it does not impact the interaction between LF/EF and PA63. Additional assays were performed to examine the inhibitory effects of the subset of VHHs on LF function under cellular conditions. Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were treated with LF that had been preincubated with VHHs and PA, and Western blotting was performed to assess MEK cleavage as a readout of toxin entry and activity (Fig. 5C; supplemental Fig. S6). Consistent with the ELISA data, JMO-B3 and JMO-G1 significantly inhibited LF entry and cleavage of MEK1, -2, and -3 (p < 0.05), whereas JMN-D10 did not (p > 0.05) (unpaired t test; Fig. 5C; supplemental Fig. S6). Surprisingly for an LF neutralizer, we found that JMO-B9 also did not prevent LF entry and MEK cleavage by the toxin, even at doses of toxin used in the neutralization assays and conditions where cells were protected from death (Fig. 5C; supplemental Fig. S6). Together, these data demonstrate that JMO-B3 and JMO-G1 are able to inhibit LF binding to PA63, toxin entry, and MEK cleavage, although JMO-B9, which binds to an epitope outside the PA-interacting N terminus of LF, does not prevent MEK cleavage. Under two sets of assay conditions, JMO-B9 consistently led to a small but reproducible reduction in MEK cleavage (Fig. 5C; supplemental Fig. S6), suggesting the possibility of altered kinetics for interaction with this toxin substrate. The macrophage death utilized in the standard LF neutralization assay requires the toxin cleavage of the NLRP1b inflammasome sensor, which is expressed at undetectable levels in cells (data not shown). It is possible that a small impact on NLRP1b cleavage can result in protection from pyroptosis under our neutralization assay's “low toxin” conditions. Therefore, to test the hypothesis that the difference in impact of JMO-B9 on cleavage of MEK proteins relative to cell death is a kinetic effect, we compared JMO-B9, JMO-G1, and JMO-B3 to the potent PA-neutralizing VHH JKH-C7 under “high toxin” concentration neutralization assays (supplemental Fig. S7). JMO-B9 was no longer able to neutralize toxin when concentrations of 750 or 1500 ng/ml were used in neutralization assays, whereas JMO-B3, JMO-G1, and JKH-C7 were still neutralizing, albeit with higher IC50 values. These findings indicate that although JMO-B9 is identified as an LF-neutralizing VHH in the standard anthrax toxin neutralization assay, it is ineffective as a neutralizing agent over higher toxin concentrations. To characterize the VHHs as therapeutic candidates, we first tested EF-neutralizing JMN-D10 for its ability to inhibit ET-induced edema in mouse footpads. BALB/cJ mice were IV injected with the PA-neutralizing VHH JKH-C7 or with JMN-D10 before footpad administration of ET, and edema was assessed at 21 h post-toxin administration. A single administration of 25 μg of either VHH was sufficient to significantly inhibit edema (p < 0.0001) almost to the levels of control footpads injected with PBS (Fig. 6A). The in vivo efficacy of JMN-D10 in this model suggests striking potency for this antibody acting in the first minutes after toxin administration and before VHH clearance.

It has not been definitely established that Ureaplasma species can cause hyperammonemia. We established a novel immunocompromised murine model of Ureaplasma urealyticum infection and used it to confirm that U. urealyticum can cause hyperammonemia. Male C3H mice were pharmacologically immunosuppressed with mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus and oral prednisone for seven days, and then challenged intratracheally (IT) and/or intraperitoneally (IP) with 107 CFU U. urealyticum over six days, while continuing immunosuppression. Spent U. urealyticum-free U9 broth was used as a negative control, with uninfected immunocompetent mice, uninfected immunosuppressed mice, and infected immunocompetent mice serving as additional controls. Plasma ammonia concentrations were compared using Wilcoxon ranks sum tests. Plasma ammonia concentrations of immunosuppressed mice challenged IT/IP with spent U9 broth (n = 14) (range 155-330 μmol/L) were similar to those of normal mice (n = 5), uninfected immunosuppressed mice (n = 5), and U. urealyticum IT/IP challenged immunocompetent mice (n = 5) [range 99-340 μmol/L, p = 0.60]. However, immunosuppressed mice challenged with U. urealyticum IT/IP (n = 20) or IP (n = 15) had higher plasma ammonia concentrations (range 225-945 μmol/L and 276-687 μmol/L, respectively) than those challenged IT/IP with spent U9 broth (p<0.001). U. urealyticum administered IT/IP or IP causes hyperammonemia in mice pharmacologically immunosuppressed with a regimen similar to that administered to lung transplant recipients."
https://openalex.org/W2513237213,"Background Avian bornaviruses are a genetically diverse group of viruses initially discovered in 2008. They are known to infect several avian orders. Bornaviruses of parrots and related species (Psittaciformes) are causative agents of proventricular dilatation disease, a chronic and often fatal neurologic disease widely distributed in captive psittacine populations. Although knowledge has considerably increased in the past years, many aspects of the biology of avian bornaviruses are still undiscovered. In particular, the precise way of transmission remains unknown. Aims and Methods In order to collect further information on the epidemiology of bornavirus infections in birds we collected samples from captive and free-ranging aquatic birds (n = 738) and Passeriformes (n = 145) in Germany and tested them for the presence of bornaviruses by PCR assays covering a broad range of known bornaviruses. We detected aquatic bird bornavirus 1 (ABBV-1) in three out of 73 sampled free-ranging mute swans (Cygnus olor) and one out of 282 free-ranging Eurasian oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus). Canary bornavirus 1 (CnBV-1), CnBV-2 and CnBV-3 were detected in four, six and one out of 48 captive common canaries (Serinus canaria forma domestica), respectively. In addition, samples originating from 49 bornavirus-positive captive Psittaciformes were used for determination of parrot bornavirus 2 (PaBV-2) and PaBV-4 sequences. Bornavirus sequences compiled during this study were used for phylogenetic analysis together with all related sequences available in GenBank. Results of the Study Within ABBV-1, PaBV-2 and PaBV-4, identical or genetically closely related bornavirus sequences were found in parallel in various different avian species, suggesting that inter-species transmission is frequent relative to the overall transmission of these viruses. Our results argue for an important role of horizontal transmission, but do not exclude the additional possibility of vertical transmission. Furthermore we defined clearly separated sequence clusters within several avian bornaviruses, providing a basis for an improved interpretation of transmission events within and between wild bird populations and captive bird collections."

In Parkinson's disease, the loss of dopaminergic neurons is associated with elevated histamine levels and disrupted sleep/wake cycles, but the mechanism is not understood. To characterize the role of dopamine in the development of histamine neurons, we inhibited the translation of the two non-allelic forms of tyrosine hydroxylase (th1 and th2) in zebrafish larvae. We found that dopamine levels were reduced in both th1 and th2 knockdown, but the serotonin level and number of serotonin neurons remained unchanged. Further, we demonstrated that th2 knockdown increased histamine neuron number and histamine levels, whereas increased dopaminergic sigNAling using the dopamine precursor l-DOPA (l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) or dopamine receptor agonists reduced the number of histaminergic neurons.

Valproic acid, conversely, is known as an up-regulator of GM3 synthase gene (ST3GAL5). To test the possibility that valproic acid could inhibit EGFR phosphorylation by increasing the level of GM3 in cells, we treated A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells with valproic acid and found that valproic acid treatment caused an about 6-fold increase in the GM3 level but only a marginal increase in the GM2 level in these cells and that the observed increase in GM3 level was valproic acid dose-dependent. Consistent with this observation, valproic acid treatment induced GM3 synthase gene expression by about 8-fold. Furthermore, phosphorylation of EGFR was reduced, and cell proliferation was inhibited following valproic acid treatment. Consistent with these results, transient expression of GM3 synthase gene in A431 cells also increased cellular level of GM3, reduced phosphorylation of EGFR, and inhibited cell proliferation. Treatment with l-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-l-propanol, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthesis, decreased the cellular level of GM3 and reduced the inhibitory effects of valproic acid on EGFR phosphorylation and cell proliferation. These results suggested that induction of GM3 synthesis was enough to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells by suppressing EGFR activity.

https://openalex.org/W2512018277,"Glutinous rice flour (GRF) and glutinous rice starch (GRS) were modified by dry-heat treatment and their rheological, thermal properties and freeze-thaw stability were evaluated. Compared with the native GRF and GRS, the water-holding ability of modified GRF and GRS were enhanced. Both the onset and peak temperatures of the modified samples increased while the endothermic enthalpy change decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, dry heating remarkably increased the apparent viscosities of both GRF and GRS. Importantly, compared with GRS samples, the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G"") values of modified GRF increased more greatly and the tanδ values decreased more remarkably, indicating that the dry-heat treatment showed more impact on the GRF and a higher viscoelasticity compared with GRS. Our results suggest the dry-heat treatment of GRF is a more effective method than that of GRS, which omits the complex and tedious process for purifying GRS, and thereby has more practical applications in the food industry."

Effective intervention for obesity remains limited. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of a group based lifestyle modification programme amongst obese individuals with an existing dietary counseling programme.We recruited one hundred and ninety four overweight and obese (BMI>27.5 kg/m2) employees from a local university. They were randomly allocated to either Group Support Lifestyle Modification (GSLiM) (intervention)(n = 97) or dietary counseling (comparison)(n = 97). The GSLIM activities included self monitoring, cognitive-behaviour sessions, exercise as well as dietary change advocacy, which were conducted through seminars and group sessions over 24 weeks. The comparison group was given dietary counselling once in 12 weeks. Both groups were followed up for additional 12 weeks to check for intervention effect sustenance. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured at baseline, 12, 24 and 36 weeks; while dietary intake, physical activities, psychological measures and quality of life measured at baseline, 24 and 36 weeks. Data analysis was conducted using ANOVA repeated measures with intention to treat principle.The participants were predominantly women with mean (standard deviation) age of 40.5 (9.3) years. A total of 19.6% of the participants in GSLiM achieved 6% weight loss compared to 4.1% in the comparison group (Risk Ratio 4.75; 95% CI: 1.68, 13.45). At 24 weeks, the retention rate was 83.5% for GSLiM and 82.5% for comparison group. GSLiM participants also achieved significant improvement in total weight self-efficacy score, negative emotions and physical discomfort subscales, MDPSS friend subscale and all domains in quality of life. Participants in the comparison group experienced reduction in negative self-thoughts.The GSLiM programme proved to be more effective in achieving targeted weight loss, improving weight self-efficacy, friend social support, and quality of life compared to dietary counseling.Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials IRCT201104056127N1."
https://openalex.org/W2524031398,"The tyrosine kinase inhibitor TAS-115 that blocks VEGF receptor and hepatocyte growth factor receptor MET signaling exhibits antitumor properties in xenografts of human gastric carcinoma. In this study, we have evaluated the efficacy of TAS-115 in preventing prostate cancer metastasis to the bone and bone destruction using the PC3 cell line. When PC3 cells were injected into proximal tibiae in nude mouse, severe trabecular and cortical bone destruction and subsequent tumor growths were detected. Oral administration of TAS-115 almost completely inhibited both PC3-induced bone loss and PC3 cell proliferation by suppressing osteoclastic bone resorption. In an ex vivo bone organ culture, PC3 cells induced osteoclastic bone resorption when co-cultured with calvarial bone, but TAS-115 effectively suppressed the PC3-induced bone destruction. We found that macrophage colony-stimulating factor-dependent macrophage differentiation and subsequent receptor activator of NF-κB ligand-induced osteoclast formation were largely suppressed by adding TAS-115. The phosphorylation of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor FMS and osteoclast related kinases such as ERK and Akt were also suppressed by the presence of TAS-115. Gene expression profiling showed that FMS expression was only seen in macrophage and in the osteoclast cell lineage. Our study indicates that tyrosine kinase signaling in host pre-osteoclasts/osteoclasts is critical for bone destruction induced by tumor cells and that targeting of MET/VEGF receptor/FMS activity makes it a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2507548411,"Acetobacter pasteurianus is an aerobic Gram-negative rod that is used in the fermentation process used to produce the traditional Japanese black rice vinegar kurozu. Previously, we found that a hydrophobic fraction derived from kurozu stimulates Toll-like receptors to produce cytokines. LPSs, particularly LPS from A. pasteurianus, are strong candidates for the immunostimulatory component of kurozu. The LPS of A. pasteurianus remains stable in acidic conditions during the 2 years of the abovementioned fermentation process. Thus, we hypothesized that its stability results from its structure. In this study, we isolated the LPS produced by A. pasteurianus NBRC 3283 bacterial cells and characterized the structure of its lipid A component. The lipid A moiety was obtained by standard weak acid hydrolysis of the LPS. However, the hydrolysis was incomplete because a certain proportion of the LPS contained acid-stable d-glycero-d-talo-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Ko) residues instead of the acid-labile 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid residues that are normally found in typical LPS. Even so, we obtained a Ko-substituted lipid A with a novel sugar backbone, α-Man(1–4)[α-Ko(2–6)]β-GlcN3N(1–6)α-GlcN(1–1)α-GlcA. Its reducing end GlcN(1-1)GlcA bond was also found to be quite acid-stable. Six fatty acids were attached to the backbone. Both the whole LPS and the lipid A moiety induced TNF-α production in murine cells via Toll-like receptor 4, although their activity was weaker than those of Escherichia coli LPS and lipid A. These results suggest that the structurally atypical A. pasteurianus lipid A found in this study remains stable and, hence, retains its immunostimulatory activity during acetic acid fermentation."

The objectives were to construct a Taiwan Frailty Index to predict mortality risk, and to explore the structure of its factors.Analytic data on 1,284 participants aged 53 and older were excerpted from the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (2006), in Taiwan. A consensus workgroup of geriatricians selected 159 items according to the standard procedure for creating a Frailty Index. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to explore the association between the Taiwan Frailty Index and mortality. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify structure factors and produce a shorter version-the Taiwan Frailty Index Short-Form.During an average follow-up of 4.3 ± 0.8 years, 140 (11%) subjects died. Compared to those in the lowest Taiwan Frailty Index tertile (< 0.18), those in the uppermost tertile (> 0.23) had significantly higher risk of death (Hazard ratio: 3.2; 95% CI 1.9-5.4). Thirty-five items of five structure factors identified by exploratory factor analysis, included: physical activities, life satisfaction and financial status, health status, cognitive function, and stresses. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (C-statistics) of the Taiwan Frailty Index and its Short-Form were 0.80 and 0.78, respectively, with no statistically significant difference between them.Although both the Taiwan Frailty Index and Short-Form were associated with mortality, the Short-Form, which had similar accuracy in predicting mortality as the full Taiwan Frailty Index, would be more expedient in clinical practice and community settings to target frailty screening and intervention."

https://openalex.org/W2518221333,"The objective of this study was to identify microRNAs associated with a serum antibody response to Mycoplasma bovis in beef cattle. Serum from sixteen beef calves was collected at three points: in summer after calves were born, in fall at weaning, and in the following spring. All sera collected in the summer were ELISA-negative for anti-M. bovis. By the fall, eight animals were seropositive for IgG (positive group), while eight remained negative (negative group). By spring, all animals in both groups were seropositive. MicroRNAs were extracted from sera and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq next-generation sequencer. A total of 1,374,697 sequences mapped to microRNAs in the bovine genome. Of these, 82% of the sequences corresponded to 27 microRNAs, each represented by a minimum of 10,000 sequences. There was a statistically significant interaction between ELISA response and season for bta-miR-24-3p (P = 0.0268). All sera collected at the initial summer had a similar number of copies of this microRNA (P = 0.773). In the fall, the positive group had an increased number of copies when compared to the negative group (P = 0.021), and this grew more significant by the following spring (P = 0.0001). There were 21 microRNAs associated (P< 0.05) with season. These microRNAs could be evaluated further as candidates to potentially improve productivity in cattle. The microRNAs bta-let-7b, bta-miR- 24-3p, bta-miR- 92a, and bta-miR-423-5p, were significatly associated with ELISA status (P< 0.05). These microRNAs have been recognized as playing a role in the host defense against bacteria in humans, mice, and dairy cattle. Further studies are needed to establish if these microRNAs could be used as diagnostic marker or indicator of exposure, or whether intervention strategies could be developed as an alternative to antibiotics for controlling disease due to M. bovis."
https://openalex.org/W2508064281,"Trans-membrane signaling involving a serine/threonine kinase (Stt7 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) directs light energy distribution between the two photosystems of oxygenic photosynthesis. Oxidation of plastoquinol mediated by the cytochrome b6f complex on the electrochemically positive side of the thylakoid membrane activates the kinase domain of Stt7 on the trans (negative) side, leading to phosphorylation and redistribution (state transition) of the light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins between the two photosystems. The molecular description of the Stt7 kinase and its interaction with the cytochrome b6f complex are unknown or unclear. In this study, Stt7 kinase has been cloned, expressed, and purified in a heterologous host. Stt7 kinase is shown to be active in vitro in the presence of reductant and purified as a tetramer, as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation, electron microscopy, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, with a molecular weight of 332 kDa, consisting of an 83.41-kDa monomer. Far-UV circular dichroism spectra show Stt7 to be mostly α-helical and document a physical interaction with the b6f complex through increased thermal stability of Stt7 secondary structure. The activity of wild-type Stt7 and its Cys-Ser mutant at positions 68 and 73 in the presence of a reductant suggest that the enzyme does not require a disulfide bridge for its activity as suggested elsewhere. Kinase activation in vivo could result from direct interaction between Stt7 and the b6f complex or long-range reduction of Stt7 by superoxide, known to be generated in the b6f complex by quinol oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2515842706,"Reproduction is thought to come at a cost to longevity. Based on the assumption that increased energy expenditure during reproduction is associated with increased free-radical production by mitochondria, oxidative damage has been suggested to drive this trade-off. We examined the impact of reproduction on liver mitochondrial function by utilizing post-reproductive and non-reproductive house mice (Mus musculus) living under semi-natural conditions. The age-matched post-reproductive and non-reproductive groups were compared after the reproductive females returned to a non-reproductive state, so that both groups were in the same physiological state at the time the liver was collected. Despite increased oxidative damage (p = 0.05) and elevated CuZnSOD (p = 0.002) and catalase (p = 0.04) protein levels, reproduction had no negative impacts on the respiratory function of liver mitochondria. Specifically, in a post-reproductive, maintenance state the mitochondrial coupling (i.e., respiratory control ratio) of mouse livers show no negative impacts of reproduction. In fact, there was a trend (p = 0.059) to suggest increased maximal oxygen consumption by liver mitochondria during the ADP stimulated state (i.e., state 3) in post-reproduction. These findings suggest that oxidative damage may not impair mitochondrial respiratory function and question the role of mitochondria in the trade-off between reproduction and longevity. In addition, the findings highlight the importance of quantifying the respiratory function of mitochondria in addition to measuring oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W2517171837,"For top performers, including athletes and musicians, even subtle inconsistencies in rhythm and force during movement production decrease the quality of performance. However, extensive training over many years beginning in childhood is unable to perfect dexterous motor performance so that it is without any error. To gain insight into the biological mechanisms underlying the subtle defects of motor actions, the present study sought to identify the kinematic origins of inconsistency of dexterous finger movements in musical performance. Seven highly-skilled pianists who have won prizes at international piano competitions played a short sequence of tones with the right hand at a predetermined tempo. Time-varying joint angles of the fingers were recorded using a custom-made data glove, and the timing and velocity of the individual keystrokes were recorded from a digital piano. Both ridge and stepwise multiple regression analyses demonstrated an association of the inter-trial variability of the inter-keystroke interval (i.e., rhythmic inconsistency) with both the rotational velocity of joints of the finger used for a keystroke (i.e., striking finger) and the movement independence between the striking and non-striking fingers. This indicates a relationship between rhythmic inconsistency in musical performance and the dynamic features of movements in not only the striking finger but also the non-striking fingers. In contrast, the inter-trial variability of the key-descending velocity (i.e., loudness inconsistency) was associated mostly with the kinematic features of the striking finger at the moment of the keystroke. Furthermore, there was no correlation between the rhythmic and loudness inconsistencies. The results suggest distinct kinematic origins of inconsistencies in rhythm and loudness in expert musical performance."

The isolate had meso-diaminopimelic in the cell wall with whole-cell sugars of mannose, rhamnose, ribose, glucose, galactose, and arabinose. The menaquinone detected was MK-9(H4), while the major cellular fatty acids include C17:1 ω8c, C15:0 iso, C15:1 iso G and C16:0 iso. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside and an unidentified phospholipid. The DNA-DNA hybridization values between strains JXJ CY 19T and the closely related type strains Modestobacter marinus CGMCC 4.5581T and Modestobacter roseus NBRC 108673T were determined to be 50.8 ± 0.8% and 44.1 ± 1.7%, respectively. The DNA G+C content was 71.9 mol%. On the basis of the above taxonomic data and differences in physiological characters from the closely related type strains, strain JXJ CY 19T was recognized as a novel species of the genus Modestobacter, for which the name Modestobacter lacusdianchii sp. nov. (JXJ CY 19T = KCTC 39600T = CPCC 204352T) is proposed. The type strain JXJ CY 19T can solubilize calcium phosphate tribasic (Ca3(PO4)2), phytin and L-α-phosphatidylcholine. The phosphate-solubilizing property of the novel actinobacterium could be a possible factor for the increase in growth of Microcystis aeruginosa FACHB-905 in ecosystem where the amount of available soluble phosphate is limited such as Dianchi Lake."
https://openalex.org/W2508276920,"Impaired proximal insulin signaling is often present in diabetes. Hence, approaches to enhance glucose disposal independent of proximal insulin signaling are desirable. Evidence indicates that Adenovirus-derived E4orf1 protein may offer such an approach. This study determined if E4orf1 improves insulin sensitivity and downregulates proximal insulin signaling in vivo and enhances cellular glucose uptake independent of proximal insulin signaling in vitro. High fat fed mice were injected with a retrovirus plasmid expressing E4orf1, or a null vector. E4orf1 significantly improved insulin sensitivity in response to a glucose load. Yet, their proximal insulin signaling in fat depots was impaired, as indicated by reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR), and significantly increased abundance of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1 (ENPP1). In 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes E4orf1 expression impaired proximal insulin signaling. Whereas, treatment with rosiglitazone reduced ENPP1 abundance. Unaffected by IR-KD (insulin receptor knockdown) with siRNA, E4orf1 significantly up-regulated distal insulin signaling pathway and enhanced cellular glucose uptake. In vivo, E4orf1 impairs proximal insulin signaling in fat depots yet improves glycemic control. This is probably explained by the ability of E4orf1 to promote cellular glucose uptake independent of proximal insulin signaling. E4orf1 may provide a therapeutic template to enhance glucose disposal in the presence of impaired proximal insulin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2517291019,"Zinc (Zn) nutrition is of key relevance in India, as a large fraction of the population suffers from Zn malnutrition and many soils contain little plant available Zn. In this study we compared organic and conventional wheat cropping systems with respect to DTPA (diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid)-extractable Zn as a proxy for plant available Zn, yield, and grain Zn concentration. We analyzed soil and wheat grain samples from 30 organic and 30 conventional farms in Madhya Pradesh (central India), and conducted farmer interviews to elucidate sociological and management variables. Total and DTPA-extractable soil Zn concentrations and grain yield (3400 kg ha-1) did not differ between the two farming systems, but with 32 and 28 mg kg-1 respectively, grain Zn concentrations were higher on organic than conventional farms (t = -2.2, p = 0.03). Furthermore, multiple linear regression analyses revealed that (a) total soil zinc and sulfur concentrations were the best predictors of DTPA-extractable soil Zn, (b) Olsen phosphate taken as a proxy for available soil phosphorus, exchangeable soil potassium, harvest date, training of farmers in nutrient management, and soil silt content were the best predictors of yield, and (c) yield, Olsen phosphate, grain nitrogen, farmyard manure availability, and the type of cropping system were the best predictors of grain Zn concentration. Results suggested that organic wheat contained more Zn despite same yield level due to higher nutrient efficiency. Higher nutrient efficiency was also seen in organic wheat for P, N and S. The study thus suggests that appropriate farm management can lead to competitive yield and improved Zn concentration in wheat grains on organic farms."
https://openalex.org/W2514108405,"Targeted gene knockout mouse models have helped to identify roles of autophagy in many tissues. Here, we investigated the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of Atg7f/f Tyr-Cre mice (on a C57BL/6 background), in which Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of the tyrosinase promoter to delete the autophagy gene Atg7. In line with pigment cell-directed blockade of autophagy, the RPE and the melanocytes of the choroid showed strong accumulation of the autophagy adaptor and substrate, sequestosome 1 (Sqstm1)/p62, relative to the levels in control mice. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis demonstrated that the RPE, but not the choroid melanocytes, of Atg7f/f Tyr-Cre mice also had strongly increased levels of retinoid isomerohydrolase RPE65, a pivotal enzyme for the maintenance of visual perception. In contrast to Sqstm1, genes involved in retinal regeneration, i.e. Lrat, Rdh5, Rgr, and Rpe65, were expressed at higher mRNA levels. Sequencing of the Rpe65 gene showed that Atg7f/f and Atg7f/f Tyr-Cre mice carry a point mutation (L450M) that is characteristic for the C57BL/6 mouse strain and reportedly causes enhanced degradation of the RPE65 protein by an as-yet unknown mechanism. These results suggest that the increased abundance of RPE65 M450 in the RPE of Atg7f/f Tyr-Cre mice is, at least partly, mediated by upregulation of Rpe65 transcription; however, our data are also compatible with the hypothesis that the RPE65 M450 protein is degraded by Atg7-dependent autophagy in Atg7f/f mice. Further studies in mice of different genetic backgrounds are necessary to determine the relative contributions of these mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2513053496,"Salmonellosis is one of the most important bacterial zoonotic diseases transmitted through the consumption of contaminated food, with chicken and pig related products being key reservoirs of infection. Although numerous studies on animal vaccination have been performed in order to reduce Salmonella prevalence, there is still a need for an ideal vaccine. Here, with the aim of constructing a novel live attenuated Salmonella vaccine candidate, we firstly analyzed the impact of the absence of cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) in Salmonella virulence. C-di-GMP is an intracellular second messenger that controls a wide range of bacterial processes, including biofilm formation and synthesis of virulence factors, and also modulates the host innate immune response. Our results showed that a Salmonella multiple mutant in the twelve genes encoding diguanylate cyclase proteins that, as a consequence, cannot synthesize c-di-GMP, presents a moderate attenuation in a systemic murine infection model. An additional mutation of the rpoS gene resulted in a synergic attenuating effect that led to a highly attenuated strain, referred to as ΔXIII, immunogenic enough to protect mice against a lethal oral challenge of a S. Typhimurium virulent strain. ΔXIII immunogenicity relied on activation of both antibody and cell mediated immune responses characterized by the production of opsonizing antibodies and the induction of significant levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-17 and IL-10. ΔXIII was unable to form a biofilm and did not survive under desiccation conditions, indicating that it could be easily eliminated from the environment. Moreover, ΔXIII shows DIVA features that allow differentiation of infected and vaccinated animals. Altogether, these results show ΔXIII as a safe and effective live DIVA vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2517611341,"Arid3a and Arid3b belong to a subfamily of ARID (AT-rich interaction domain) transcription factors. The Arid family is involved in regulating chromatin accessibility, proliferation, and differentiation. Arid3a and Arid3b are closely related and share a unique REKLES domain that mediates their homo- and hetero-multimerization. Arid3a was originally isolated as a B cell transcription factor binding to the AT rich matrix attachment regions (MARS) of the immunoglobulin heavy chain intronic enhancer. Deletion of Arid3a results in a highly penetrant embryonic lethality with severe defects in erythropoiesis and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The few surviving Arid3a-/- (<1%) animals have decreased HSCs and early progenitors in the bone marrow, but all mature lineages are normally represented in the bone marrow and periphery except for B cells. Arid3b-/- animals die around E7.5 precluding examination of hematopoietic development. So it is unclear whether the phenotype of Arid3a loss on hematopoiesis is dependent or independent of Arid3b. In this study we circumvented this limitation by also examining hematopoiesis in mice with a conditional allele of Arid3b. Bone marrow lacking Arid3b shows decreased common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) and downstream B cell populations while the T cell and myeloid lineages are unchanged, reminiscent of the adult hematopoietic defect in Arid3a mice. Unlike Arid3a-/- mice, HSC populations are unperturbed in Arid3b-/- mice. This study demonstrates that HSC development is independent of Arid3b, whereas B cell development requires both Arid3a and Arid3b transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2517813393,"In the context of multivariate multilevel data analysis, this paper focuses on the multivariate linear mixed-effects model, including all the correlations between the random effects when the dimensional residual terms are assumed uncorrelated. Using the EM algorithm, we suggest more general expressions of the model’s parameters estimators. These estimators can be used in the framework of the multivariate longitudinal data analysis as well as in the more general context of the analysis of multivariate multilevel data. By using a likelihood ratio test, we test the significance of the correlations between the random effects of two dependent variables of the model, in order to investigate whether or not it is useful to model these dependent variables jointly. Simulation studies are done to assess both the parameter recovery performance of the EM estimators and the power of the test. Using two empirical data sets which are of longitudinal multivariate type and multivariate multilevel type, respectively, the usefulness of the test is illustrated."
https://openalex.org/W2507838354,"To evaluate the changes in glycemia, insulinemia, and oxidative stress markers during an oral fat load test in nondiabetic subjects with abdominal obesity and to analyze the association between postprandial oxidative stress markers and postprandial glucose and insulin responses.We included 20 subjects with abdominal obesity (waist circumference > 102 cm for men and > 88 cm for women) and 20 healthy lean controls (waist circumference < 102 cm for men and < 88 cm for women). After 12 hours of fasting we performed a standardized fat load test (0-8 hours) with supracal® (50 g/m2). We determined metabolic parameters, oxidized and reduced glutathione, and malondialdehyde.In both groups, insulin, HOMA, oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio, and malondialdehyde significantly decreased in the postprandial state after the OFLT. All these parameters were significantly higher in the abdominal obesity group at baseline and during all the postprandial points, but the reduction from the baseline levels was significantly higher in the abdominal obesity group.Unsaturated fat improves insulin resistance and oxidative stress status. It is possible that a consumption of unsaturated fat could be beneficial even in subjects with abdominal obesity in postprandial state."
https://openalex.org/W2514302339,"The functional impact of intratumoral heterogeneity has been difficult to assess in the absence of a means to interrogate dynamic, live-cell biochemical events in the native tissue context of a human tumor. Conventional histological methods can reveal morphology and static biomarker expression patterns but do not provide a means to probe and evaluate tumor functional behavior and live-cell responsiveness to experimentally controlled stimuli. Here, we describe an approach that couples vibratome-mediated viable tissue sectioning with live-cell confocal microscopy imaging to visualize human parathyroid adenoma tumor cell responsiveness to extracellular calcium challenge. Tumor sections prepared as 300 micron-thick tissue slices retain viability throughout a >24 hour observation period and retain the native architecture of the parental tumor. Live-cell observation of biochemical signaling in response to extracellular calcium challenge in the intact tissue slices reveals discrete, heterogeneous kinetic waveform categories of calcium agonist reactivity within each tumor. Plotting the proportion of maximally responsive tumor cells as a function of calcium concentration yields a sigmoid dose-response curve with a calculated calcium EC50 value significantly elevated above published reference values for wild-type calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) sensitivity. Subsequent fixation and immunofluorescence analysis of the functionally evaluated tissue specimens allows alignment and mapping of the physical characteristics of individual cells within the tumor to specific calcium response behaviors. Evaluation of the relative abundance of intracellular PTH in tissue slices challenged with variable calcium concentrations demonstrates that production of the hormone can be dynamically manipulated ex vivo. The capability of visualizing live human tumor tissue behavior in response to experimentally controlled conditions opens a wide range of possibilities for personalized ex vivo therapeutic testing. This highly adaptable system provides a unique platform for live-cell ex vivo provocative testing of human tumor responsiveness to a range of physiological agonists or candidate therapeutic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2509315615,"Methods commonly used clinically to assess cardiac function in patients with heart failure include ejection fraction (EF), exercise treadmill testing (ETT), and symptom evaluation. Although these approaches are useful in evaluating patients with heart failure, there are at times substantial mismatches between individual assessments. For example, ETT results are often discordant with EF, and patients with minimal symptoms sometimes have surprisingly low EFs. To better define the relationship of these methods of assessment, we studied 56 patients with heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF) who underwent measurement of ETT duration, EF by echocardiography, quantitative symptom evaluation, and LV peak dP/dt (rate of left ventricular pressure development and decline, measured invasively). Correlations were determined among these four tests in order to assess the relationship of EF, ETT, and symptoms against LV peak dP/dt. In addition, we sought to determine whether EF, ETT, and symptoms correlated with each other. Overall, correlations were poor. Only 15 of 63 total correlations (24%) were significant (p < 0.05). EF correlated most closely with LV peak -dP/dt. Linear regression analysis indicated that EF, ETT, and symptoms taken together predicted LV peak dP/dt better than any one measure alone. We conclude that clinical tests used to assess LV function in patients with HFrEF may not be as accurate or correlate as well as expected. All three clinical measures considered together may be the best representation of cardiac function in HFrEF patients currently available."
