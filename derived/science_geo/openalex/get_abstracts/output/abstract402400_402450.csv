https://openalex.org/W2012331775,"Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the world's most important non-grain food crop and is central to global food security. It is clonally propagated, highly heterozygous, autotetraploid, and suffers acute inbreeding depression. Here we use a homozygous doubled-monoploid potato clone to sequence and assemble 86% of the 844-megabase genome. We predict 39,031 protein-coding genes and present evidence for at least two genome duplication events indicative of a palaeopolyploid origin. As the first genome sequence of an asterid, the potato genome reveals 2,642 genes specific to this large angiosperm clade. We also sequenced a heterozygous diploid clone and show that gene presence/absence variants and other potentially deleterious mutations occur frequently and are a likely cause of inbreeding depression. Gene family expansion, tissue-specific expression and recruitment of genes to new pathways contributed to the evolution of tuber development. The potato genome sequence provides a platform for genetic improvement of this vital crop."
https://openalex.org/W2050932531,"Both observational and perturbational technologies are essential for advancing the understanding of brain function and dysfunction. But while observational techniques have greatly advanced in the last century, techniques for perturbation that are matched to the speed and heterogeneity of neural systems have lagged behind. The technology of optogenetics represents a step toward addressing this disparity. Reliable and targetable single-component tools (which encompass both light sensation and effector function within a single protein) have enabled versatile new classes of investigation in the study of neural systems. Here we provide a primer on the application of optogenetics in neuroscience, focusing on the single-component tools and highlighting important problems, challenges, and technical considerations."
https://openalex.org/W2104415321,"Voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels initiate electrical signalling in excitable cells and are the molecular targets for drugs and disease mutations, but the structural basis for their voltage-dependent activation, ion selectivity and drug block is unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of a voltage-gated Na+ channel from Arcobacter butzleri (NavAb) captured in a closed-pore conformation with four activated voltage sensors at 2.7 Å resolution. The arginine gating charges make multiple hydrophilic interactions within the voltage sensor, including unanticipated hydrogen bonds to the protein backbone. Comparisons to previous open-pore potassium channel structures indicate that the voltage-sensor domains and the S4–S5 linkers dilate the central pore by pivoting together around a hinge at the base of the pore module. The NavAb selectivity filter is short, ∼4.6 Å wide, and water filled, with four acidic side chains surrounding the narrowest part of the ion conduction pathway. This unique structure presents a high-field-strength anionic coordination site, which confers Na+ selectivity through partial dehydration via direct interaction with glutamate side chains. Fenestrations in the sides of the pore module are unexpectedly penetrated by fatty acyl chains that extend into the central cavity, and these portals are large enough for the entry of small, hydrophobic pore-blocking drugs. This structure provides the template for understanding electrical signalling in excitable cells and the actions of drugs used for pain, epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia at the atomic level. The X-ray crystal structure of a voltage-gated sodium channel from Arcobacter butzleri has been determined, with the channel in the closed-pore conformation. Channels of this type initiate electrical signalling in excitable cells and are the molecular targets for many drugs, but the structural basis for their voltage-dependent activation and ion selectivity is not known. The selectivity filter in this sodium channel is found to be quite short, compared with those in open-pore potassium channels, and the voltage-sensor domains and linkers between segments S4 and S5 seem to dilate the central pore by pivoting together."
https://openalex.org/W2061072142,"Leptin acts in the brain to prevent obesity. The underlying neurocircuitry responsible for this is poorly understood, in part because of incomplete knowledge regarding first-order, leptin-responsive neurons. To address this, we and others have been removing leptin receptors from candidate first-order neurons. While functionally relevant neurons have been identified, the observed effects have been small, suggesting that most first-order neurons remain unidentified. Here we take an alternative approach and test whether first-order neurons are inhibitory (GABAergic, VGAT+) or excitatory (glutamatergic, VGLUT2+). Remarkably, the vast majority of leptin's antiobesity effects are mediated by GABAergic neurons; glutamatergic neurons play only a minor role. Leptin, working directly on presynaptic GABAergic neurons, many of which appear not to express AgRP, reduces inhibitory tone to postsynaptic POMC neurons. As POMC neurons prevent obesity, their disinhibition by leptin action on presynaptic GABAergic neurons probably mediates, at least in part, leptin's antiobesity effects."
https://openalex.org/W2156459362,"Matthew Brown, Peter Donnelly and colleagues report results of a genome-wide association meta-analysis and follow-up study of ankylosing spondylitis. They identify three new risk variants and report a genetic interaction between ERAP1 and HLA-B27, implicating aberrant peptide handling in the pathophysiology of this disease. Ankylosing spondylitis is a common form of inflammatory arthritis predominantly affecting the spine and pelvis that occurs in approximately 5 out of 1,000 adults of European descent. Here we report the identification of three variants in the RUNX3, LTBR-TNFRSF1A and IL12B regions convincingly associated with ankylosing spondylitis (P < 5 × 10−8 in the combined discovery and replication datasets) and a further four loci at PTGER4, TBKBP1, ANTXR2 and CARD9 that show strong association across all our datasets (P < 5 × 10−6 overall, with support in each of the three datasets studied). We also show that polymorphisms of ERAP1, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase involved in peptide trimming before HLA class I presentation, only affect ankylosing spondylitis risk in HLA-B27–positive individuals. These findings provide strong evidence that HLA-B27 operates in ankylosing spondylitis through a mechanism involving aberrant processing of antigenic peptides."

https://openalex.org/W2008762508,"Dopamine (DA) D2 receptors expressed in DA neurons (D2 autoreceptors) exert a negative feedback regulation that reduces DA neuron firing, DA synthesis and DA release. As D2 receptors are mostly expressed in postsynaptic neurons, pharmacological and genetic approaches have been unable to definitively address the in vivo contribution of D2 autoreceptors to DA-mediated behaviors. We found that midbrain DA neurons from mice deficient in D2 autoreceptors (Drd2loxP/loxP; Dat+/IRES−cre, referred to as autoDrd2KO mice) lacked DA-mediated somatodendritic synaptic responses and inhibition of DA release. AutoDrd2KO mice displayed elevated DA synthesis and release, hyperlocomotion and supersensitivity to the psychomotor effects of cocaine. The mice also exhibited increased place preference for cocaine and enhanced motivation for food reward. Our results highlight the importance of D2 autoreceptors in the regulation of DA neurotransmission and demonstrate that D2 autoreceptors are important for normal motor function, food-seeking behavior, and sensitivity to the locomotor and rewarding properties of cocaine."
https://openalex.org/W1997196734,"Mammals have two principal types of fat. White adipose tissue primarily serves to store extra energy as triglycerides, whereas brown adipose tissue is specialized to burn lipids for heat generation and energy expenditure as a defence against cold and obesity. Recent studies have demonstrated that brown adipocytes arise in vivo from a Myf5-positive, myoblastic progenitor by the action of Prdm16 (PR domain containing 16). Here, we identified a brown-fat-enriched miRNA cluster, MiR-193b-365, as a key regulator of brown fat development. Blocking miR-193b and/or miR-365 in primary brown preadipocytes markedly impaired brown adipocyte adipogenesis by enhancing Runx1t1 (runt-related transcription factor 1; translocated to, 1) expression, whereas myogenic markers were significantly induced. Forced expression of Mir193b and/or Mir365 in C2C12 myoblasts blocked the entire programme of myogenesis, and, in adipogenic conditions, miR-193b induced myoblasts to differentiate into brown adipocytes. Mir193b-365 was upregulated by Prdm16 partially through Pparα. Our results demonstrate that Mir193b-365 serves as an essential regulator for brown fat differentiation, in part by repressing myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1997470921,"Cholinergic modulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity has been studied extensively by applying receptor agonists or blockers; however, the effect of rapid physiological cholinergic stimuli on plasticity is largely unknown. Here, we report that septal cholinergic input, activated either by electrical stimulation or via an optogenetic approach, induced different types of hippocampal Schaffer collateral (SC) to CA1 synaptic plasticity, depending on the timing of cholinergic input relative to the SC input. When the cholinergic input was activated 100 or 10 ms prior to SC stimulation, it resulted in α7 nAChR-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) or short-term depression, respectively. When the cholinergic stimulation was delayed until 10 ms after the SC stimulation, a muscarinic AChR-dependent LTP was induced. Moreover, these various forms of plasticity were disrupted by Aβ exposure. These results have revealed the remarkable temporal precision of cholinergic functions, providing a novel mechanism for information processing in cholinergic-dependent higher cognitive functions."

https://openalex.org/W1982757612,"Membrane proteins that fail to be delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum must be rapidly degraded to avoid inappropriate aggregation and disruption of protein homeostasis. The mechanism of this process of mislocalized protein (MLP) degradation is unknown. Here Bag6, a chaperone complex involved in protein targeting, is identified as part of this mechanism. Bag6 interacts with and captures MLPs, coupling them to the ubiquitin-mediated degradation pathway. This could potentially achieve rapid degradation of MLPs without futile engagement of the cytosolic folding machinery. A substantial proportion of the genome encodes membrane proteins that are delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum by dedicated targeting pathways1. Membrane proteins that fail targeting must be rapidly degraded to avoid aggregation and disruption of cytosolic protein homeostasis2,3. The mechanisms of mislocalized protein (MLP) degradation are unknown. Here we reconstitute MLP degradation in vitro to identify factors involved in this pathway. We find that nascent membrane proteins tethered to ribosomes are not substrates for ubiquitination unless they are released into the cytosol. Their inappropriate release results in capture by the Bag6 complex, a recently identified ribosome-associating chaperone4. Bag6-complex-mediated capture depends on the presence of unprocessed or non-inserted hydrophobic domains that distinguish MLPs from potential cytosolic proteins. A subset of these Bag6 complex ‘clients’ are transferred to TRC40 for insertion into the membrane, whereas the remainder are rapidly ubiquitinated. Depletion of the Bag6 complex selectively impairs the efficient ubiquitination of MLPs. Thus, by its presence on ribosomes that are synthesizing nascent membrane proteins, the Bag6 complex links targeting and ubiquitination pathways. We propose that such coupling allows the fast tracking of MLPs for degradation without futile engagement of the cytosolic folding machinery."

https://openalex.org/W2021936364,"Glioblastoma is the most frequent brain tumor in adults and is the most lethal form of human cancer. Despite the improvements in treatments, survival of patients remains poor. In order to identify microRNAs (miRs) involved in glioma tumorigenesis, we evaluated, by a miRarray, differential expression of miRs in the tumorigenic glioma LN-18, LN-229 and U87MG cells compared with the non-tumorigenic T98G cells. Among different miRs we focused our attention on miR-221 and -222. We demonstrated the presence of a binding site for these two miRs in the 3′ untranslated region of the protein tyrosine phosphatase μ (PTPμ). Previous studies indicated that PTPμ suppresses cell migration and is downregulated in glioblastoma. Significantly, we found that miR-221 and -222 overexpression induced a downregulation of PTPμ as analyzed by both western blot and real-time PCR. Furthermore, miR-222 and -221 induced an increase in cell migration and growth in soft agar in glioma cells. Interestingly, the re-expression of PTPμ gene was able to revert the miR-222 and -221 effects on cell migration. Furthermore, we found an inverse correlation between miR-221 and -222 and PTPμ in human glioma cancer samples. In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-221 and -222 regulate glioma tumorigenesis at least in part through the control of PTPμ protein expression."

https://openalex.org/W2036668494,"PSD-95, a principal scaffolding component of the postsynaptic density, is targeted to synapses by palmitoylation, where it couples NMDA receptor stimulation to production of nitric oxide (NO) by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Here, we show that PSD-95 is physiologically S-nitrosylated. We identify cysteines 3 and 5, which are palmitoylated, as sites of nitrosylation, suggesting a competition between these two modifications. In support of this hypothesis, physiologically produced NO inhibits PSD-95 palmitoylation in granule cells of the cerebellum, decreasing the number of PSD-95 clusters at synaptic sites. Further, decreased palmitoylation, as seen in heterologous cells treated with 2-bromopalmitate or in ZDHHC8 knockout mice deficient in a PSD-95 palmitoyltransferase, results in increased PSD-95 nitrosylation. These data support a model in which NMDA-mediated production of NO regulates targeting of PSD-95 to synapses via mutually competitive cysteine modifications. Thus, differential modification of cysteines may represent a general paradigm in signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2141643037,"The mammalian brain contains neural stem cells (NSCs) that enable continued neurogenesis throughout adulthood. However, NSC function and/or numbers decline with increasing age. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is unique in that astrocytes secreting Wnt3 promote NSC differentiation in a paracrine manner. Here, we show that both the levels of Wnt3 protein and the number of Wnt3-secreting astrocytes influence the impairment of adult neurogenesis during aging. The age-associated reduction in Wnt3 levels affects the regulation of target genes, such as NeuroD1 and retrotransposon L1, as well as the expression of Dcx, which is located adjacent to the L1 loci. Interestingly, the decline in the extrinsic Wnt3 levels and in the intracellular expression of the target genes with aging was reversible. Exercise was found to significantly increase de novo expression of Wnt3 and thereby rescue impaired neurogenesis in aged animals. Furthermore, the chromatin state of NeuroD1, L1, and the L1 loci near Dcx changed relative to Wnt3 levels in an age- or stimulus-associated manner. These results suggest that the regulation of paracrine factors plays a critical role in hippocampal aging and neurogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2005553407,"Axon guidance receptors guide neuronal growth cones by binding in trans to axon guidance ligands in the developing nervous system. Some ligands are coexpressed in cis with their receptors, raising the question of the relative contribution of cis and trans interactions to axon guidance. Spinal motor axons use Eph receptors to select a limb trajectory in response to trans ephrins, while expressing ephrins in cis. We show that changes in motor neuron ephrin expression result in trajectory selection defects mirrored by changes in growth cone sensitivity to ephrins in vitro, arguing for ephrin cis-attenuation of Eph function. Furthermore, the relative contribution of trans-signaling and cis-attenuation is influenced by the subcellular distribution of ephrins to membrane patches containing Eph receptors. Thus, growth cone ephrins are essential for axon guidance in vivo and the balance between cis and trans modes of axon guidance ligand-receptor interaction contributes to the diversity of axon guidance signaling responses.

Motor neuron-expressed ephrins are required for limb motor axon trajectory selection Eph signaling is attenuated by coexpressed ephrins Ephrin localization balances Eph/ephrin trans/cis interactions The assembly of neuronal connections relies on molecular signals directing the guidance of axonal growth cones to their targets. The arguably small ensemble of protein families encoding axon guidance ligands and their receptors identified thus far (Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011Kolodkin A.L. Tessier-Lavigne M.

While the combinatorial employment of effectors from distinct families at a single axon guidance decision point is one solution to this problem, axonal coexpression of ligands and their receptors appears to be a complementary, yet poorly understood strategy to modulate the ability of growth cones to respond to specific guidance signals. Ephrins and Eph tyrosine kinases mediate many axon guidance events (Egea and Klein, 2007Egea J. Klein R.

Ephrins are divided into A and B classes according to the type of membrane linkage and while intraclass Eph/ephrin interactions such as ephrin-Bs interacting with EphB-class receptors are prevalent, interclass interactions have also been documented (Gale et al., 1996Gale N.W.

Intriguingly, in some neurons, Ephs and ephrins are coexpressed such that two divergent models of their function in the growth cone have been proposed: (1) Eph receptors and ephrins are present in separate cell membrane microdomains making their cis-interaction in the same neuron unlikely, allowing parallel forward and reverse trans-signaling or (2) ephrins bind to Eph receptors coexpressed in the same membrane compartment of the growth cone and attenuate forward ephrin:Eph signaling in cis by inhibiting the activation of the Eph tyrosine kinase activity (Carvalho et al., 2006Carvalho R.F.

These two signaling modes have been inferred from in vitro studies of spinal motor neurons and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) leaving outstanding the question of the relative contribution of trans-signaling and cis-attenuation to axon guidance in vivo. The selection of a limb nerve trajectory by spinal motor axons has emerged as an elegant paradigm for the in vivo study of the molecular mechanisms of axon guidance. At the cellular level, axons of the lateral and medial divisions of lateral motor column (LMC) arrive at the base of the limb and invariantly select a dorsal or a ventral limb trajectory (Lance-Jones and Landmesser, 1981bLance-Jones C.

Physiol. 1978; 284: 391-414PubMed Google Scholar). This choice is controlled, in part, by a molecular mirror symmetry of repulsive ephrin:Eph signaling: EphA4-expressing lateral LMC axons are repulsed into the dorsal limb from ephrin-As expressed in the ventral limb, whereas EphB1-expressing medial LMC axons are repulsed into the ventral limb from ephrin-Bs expressed in the dorsal limb (Eberhart et al., 2002Eberhart J.

Intriguingly, most if not all, LMC neurons express apparently low levels of other EphA and EphB receptors raising the question of whether these might also contribute to the specification of limb trajectory selection by LMC axons (Iwamasa et al., 1999Iwamasa H.

Ephrin-A expression also enables cultured LMC axons to respond in an attractive manner to EphAs in trans and in vitro experiments suggest that ephrin-A5 and Ephs segregate to distinct LMC growth cone membrane domains, thus allowing concurrent forward ephrin:Eph and reverse Eph:ephrin signaling (Marquardt et al., 2005Marquardt T.

As in spinal motor neurons, in addition to EphA receptors, retinal ganglion neurons also express ephrin-As and biochemical studies in cultured RGCs demonstrate that ephrin-As are directly interacting with EphA receptors in cis, and attenuate the sensitivity of these receptors to ephrin-A ligands provided in trans (Rashid et al., 2005Rashid T.

To understand the relationship between these signaling modes, we carried out a detailed analysis of expression and ligand and receptor binding domain occupancy state of Ephs and ephrins, followed by in vivo gain and loss of function experiments in the context of trajectory choice by LMC axons. Here, in two subpopulations of LMC neurons that select opposing dorsoventral limb trajectories, we describe a molecular mirror symmetry of cis-attenuation of EphA function by ephrin-As and cis-attenuation of EphB function by ephrin-Bs. The challenge of LMC neurons with ephrins and Ephs in vitro, in the context of ephrin loss of function argues that ephrin protein expression levels contribute to the balance between cis-attenuation and parallel signaling modes. Finally, we demonstrate that in addition to their localization to apparently separate membrane domains, EphAs and ephrin-As can also coexist in the same membrane domain allowing cis-attenuation. Together, our in vivo and in vitro experiments argue for an equilibrium between cis-attenuation and in-parallel trans-signaling modes of ephrin and Eph interaction, thus expanding the repertoire of axon guidance signaling responses during nervous system assembly. Previous studies have shown that some Eph receptors, notably EphB2, EphB3, EphA3, and EphA7 are expressed throughout the LMC, yet their function in the choice of dorsoventral limb trajectory appears restricted to only a subpopulation of LMC neurons (Eberhart et al., 2002Eberhart J.

We considered the possibility that in order to permit the selection of LMC axon trajectory with high fidelity, the function of Eph receptors expressed in LMC neurons might be modulated by coexpressed ephrins. We focused on the time of LMC axon growth into the limb mesenchyme, between Hamburger-Hamilton stage (HH st.) 25 and 27 in chick and between the embryonic day (e) 10.5 and e11.5 in mouse (Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951Hamburger V.

We determined the levels of total ligand-unbound Eph receptors (∑EphFREE) using ephrin-A5-Fc and ephrin-B2-Fc protein overlay and found that ∑EphBFREE levels are higher in medial LMC neurons when compared with lateral LMC neurons, while ∑EphAFREE levels are higher in lateral LMC neurons when compared with medial LMC neurons in tissue sections (Figures 1B–1E and 1U; p < 0.001; quantification details in Table S2) and cultured neurons (Figures 1P, 1Q, and 1U; p < 0.001) in spite of the presence of EphA and EphB proteins in both LMC divisions. To determine if some of the Eph receptors expressed in LMC neurons were present on the cell surface, we overlaid live explanted ventral spinal cord neurons with an anti-EphA3 antiserum followed by transcriptional identity assignment. We detected surface EphA3 in both medial and lateral LMC neurons and their axons, at apparently similar expression levels (Figure 1T; Figure S1). We next surveyed the levels of ∑ephrinFREE by Eph-Fc overlay, as well as ephrin protein and mRNA expression profile in LMC neurons (Imondi et al., 2000Imondi R. Wideman C. Kaprielian Z.

We observed that ∑ephrin-BFREE and ∑ephrin-AFREE levels were high in medial and lateral LMC neurons, respectively, in both, tissue sections (Figures 1F and 1G; p < 0.001) and cultured neurons (Figures 1R and 1S; p < 0.001). We found ephrin-B2 mRNA in lateral LMC neurons at a much higher level when compared with medial LMC neurons (Figures 1C and 1H; p < 0.001). In parallel, relative to lateral LMC neurons, ephrin-A5 mRNA and protein was found to be highly enriched in medial LMC neurons (Figures 1B and 1I; p < 0.001), with higher levels of ephrin-A5 protein found in axons in the ventral limb nerves (Figures 1J–1M; p < 0.001). We also detected ephrin-A5 expression in lateral LMC neurons and dorsal limb nerve axons as previously shown (Marquardt et al., 2005Marquardt T. Shirasaki R. Ghosh S. Andrews S.E. Carter N. Hunter T. Pfaff S.L. Coexpressed EphA receptors and ephrin-A ligands mediate opposing actions on growth cone navigation from distinct membrane domains.Cell. 2005; 121: 127-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), but at considerably lower levels relative to medial LMC neurons and ventral limb nerve axons (Figures 1N and 1O; p < 0.001). In sum, our protein and mRNA localization experiments suggest that although LMC neurons express Eph proteins on their surface, their availability to bind exogenous ephrin ligands in trans is inversely correlated with the levels of coexpressed ephrins (Figure 1U). We reasoned that if ephrins expressed in LMC neurons interact with Eph receptors in cis and attenuate their sensitivity to ephrins in the limb, loss of ephrin function in LMC neurons should affect the fidelity of axon trajectory choice in the limb. To test this idea, we knocked down ephrin-A5 or ephrin-B2 expression by introducing inhibitory siRNAs against ephrin-A5 mRNA ([eA5]siRNA) or ephrin-B2 mRNA ([eB2]siRNA) into LMC neurons. To do this, we coelectroporated either siRNA with a GFP expression plasmid into the chick lumbar neural tube before LMC neuron specification and axon entry into the limb (HH st. 18/19), and examined GFP+ motor axons in dorsal and ventral divisional nerve branches exiting the crural plexus at HH st. 28/29 (Kania and Jessell, 2003Kania A.

Topographic motor projections in the limb imposed by LIM homeodomain protein regulation of ephrin-A:EphA interactions.Neuron. 2003; 38: 581-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Electroporation of [eA5]siRNA or [eB2]siRNA and GFP plasmid significantly reduced ephrin-A5 or ephrin-B2 protein expression compared with embryos electroporated with a control GFP plasmid or scrambled siRNAs, and did not cause any change in their differentiation or Eph receptor expression (Figure S2; Figure S3). Quantification of GFP+ LMC neurons indicated nearly equal proportions of electroporated cells in both LMC divisions (Figure S2; Figure S3). To determine whether a knockdown of ephrin-A5 or ephrin-B2 affected the choice of limb trajectory by LMC axons, we quantified the proportions of GFP+ axons in the dorsal (d) and ventral (v) divisional limb nerve branches by integrating fluorescence intensities of a series of hindlimb section images in multiple embryos for each experimental condition (Kao et al., 2009Kao T.-J.

In embryos coelectroporated with [eA5]siRNA and GFP, significantly higher proportions of GFP+ axons were observed in the dorsal nerve branches when compared with both GFP and scrambled [eA5]siRNA controls (Figures 2A–2C ; p < 0.001 versus controls). This axonal misrouting defect was rescued by mouse ephrin-A5 expression (Figure S2). To determine whether ephrin-A5 knockdown results in redirection of medial LMC axons into the dorsal limb mesenchyme, we coelectroporated [eA5]siRNA with the e[Isl1]::GFP plasmid, which preferentially labels medial LMC motor neurons and their axons (Kao et al., 2009Kao T.-J. Palmesino E. Kania A. SRC family kinases are required for limb trajectory selection by spinal motor axons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 5690-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and as controls, the e[Isl1]::GFP plasmid only. In embryos coelectroporated with [eA5]siRNA and e[Isl1]::GFP, a significantly higher proportion of GFP+ axons was observed in the dorsal limb nerve when compared with e[Isl1]::GFP controls (Figures 2D and 2E; p < 0.001). These findings indicate that ephrin-A5 is required for the fidelity of limb trajectory selection by medial LMC axons (Figure 2N). We next asked whether LMC-expressed ephrin-B2 is required for the choice of limb trajectory. In embryos coelectroporated with [eB2]siRNA and GFP, a significantly higher proportion of GFP+ axons was observed in the ventral nerve when compared with either GFP and scrambled [eB2]siRNA controls (Figures 2A, 2F, and 2G; p < 0.001 versus controls). This axonal misrouting defect was rescued by human ephrin-B2 expression (Figure S3). To ascertain whether the loss of ephrin-B2 causes some lateral LMC axons to enter the ventral limb, we labeled LMC neurons by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) retrograde tracer injection into the ventral or dorsal shank muscles of HH st. 28/29 embryos coelectroporated with [eB2]siRNA and GFP expression plasmids or GFP alone and determined the LMC divisional identity of labeled neurons (Kania and Jessell, 2003Kania A.

The proportion of medial LMC neurons labeled by dorsal limb HRP injections was the same in ephrin-B2 knockdown and control embryos arguing that ephrin-B2 is not required for the choice of limb axon trajectory by medial LMC neurons (Figures 2H–2J; p = 0.078). In contrast, the proportion of lateral LMC labeled by ventral limb HRP injections was significantly higher in ephrin-B2 knockdown embryos when compared with controls (Figures 2K–2M; p < 0.001). These observations demonstrate that ephrin-A5 and ephrin-B2 expressed by LMC motor neurons are essential for the fidelity of LMC axon guidance in the limb. To further investigate the role of LMC-expressed ephrins in limb axon trajectory choice, we performed gain of ephrin function experiments by electroporating, as above, full-length ephrin-A5 (eA5::GFP) and ephrin-B2 (eB2::GFP) fusion expression plasmids into LMC neurons and analyzed motor axon trajectories in the limb (Figures S4 and S5). In eA5::GFP expressing embryos, a significantly greater proportion of GFP+ axons was observed in ventral limb nerves when compared with GFP controls (Figures 3A and 3B; p < 0.001). To identify the redirected LMC axons, we labeled eA5::GFP or GFP expressing LMC neurons by HRP injections into dorsal and ventral limb muscles.

https://openalex.org/W2002043029,"Planar cell polarity (PCP) is the collective polarization of cells along the epithelial plane, a process best understood in the terminally differentiated Drosophila wing. Proliferative tissues such as mammalian skin also show PCP, but the mechanisms that preserve tissue polarity during proliferation are not understood. During mitosis, asymmetrically distributed PCP components risk mislocalization or unequal inheritance, which could have profound consequences for the long-range propagation of polarity. Here, we show that when mouse epidermal basal progenitors divide PCP components are selectively internalized into endosomes, which are inherited equally by daughter cells. Following mitosis, PCP proteins are recycled to the cell surface, where asymmetry is re-established by a process reliant on neighbouring PCP. A cytoplasmic dileucine motif governs mitotic internalization of atypical cadherin Celsr1, which recruits Vang2 and Fzd6 to endosomes. Moreover, embryos transgenic for a Celsr1 that cannot mitotically internalize exhibit perturbed hair-follicle angling, a hallmark of defective PCP. This underscores the physiological relevance and importance of this mechanism for regulating polarity during cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2048430961,"The rodent subventricular/subependymal zone (SVZ/SEZ) houses neural stem cells (NSCs) that generate olfactory bulb interneurons. It is unclear how the SVZ environment sustains neuronal production into adulthood. We discovered that the adapter molecule Ankyrin-3 (Ank3) is specifically upregulated in ventricular progenitors destined to become ependymal cells, but not in NSCs, and is required for SVZ niche assembly through progenitor lateral adhesion. Furthermore, we found that Ank3 expression is controlled by Foxj1, a transcriptional regulator of multicilia formation, and genetic deletion of this pathway led to complete loss of SVZ niche structure. Interestingly, radial glia continued to transition into postnatal NSCs without this niche. However, inducible deletion of Foxj1-Ank3 from mature SVZ ependyma resulted in dramatic depletion of neurogenesis. Targeting a pathway regulating ependymal organization/assembly and showing its requirement for new neuron production, our results have important implications for environmental control of adult neurogenesis and harvesting NSCs for replacement therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2060799314,"The constitutively active serine/threonine kinase Pim-1 is upregulated in different cancer types, mainly based on the action of several interleukines and growth factors at the transcriptional level. So far, a regulation of oncogenic Pim-1 by microRNAs (miRNAs) has not been reported. Here, we newly establish miR-33a as a miRNA with potential tumor suppressor activity, acting through inhibition of Pim-1. A screen for miRNA expression in K562 lymphoma, LS174T colon carcinoma and several other cell lines revealed generally low endogenous miR-33a levels relative to other miRNAs. Transfection of K562 and LS174T cells with a miR-33a mimic reduced Pim-1 levels substantially. In contrast, the cell-cycle regulator cyclin-dependent kinase 6 predicted to be a conserved miR-33a target, was not downregulated by the miR-33a mimic. Seed mutagenesis of the Pim-1 3′-untranslated region in a luciferase reporter construct and in a Pim-1 cDNA expressed in Pim-1-deficient Skov-3 cells demonstrated specific and direct downregulation of Pim-1 by the miR-33a mimic. The persistence of this effect was comparable to that of a small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Pim-1, resulting in decelerated cell proliferation. In conclusion, we demonstrate the potential of miR-33a to act as a tumor suppressor miRNA, which suggests miR-33a replacement therapy through delivery of miR mimics as a novel therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2093347794,"Most regions of the CNS contain many subtypes of inhibitory interneurons with specialized roles in circuit function. In the mammalian retina, the ∼30 subtypes of inhibitory interneurons called amacrine cells (ACs) are generally divided into two groups: wide/medium-field GABAergic ACs and narrow-field glycinergic ACs, which mediate lateral and vertical interactions, respectively, within the inner plexiform layer. We used expression profiling and mouse transgenic lines to identify and characterize two closely related narrow-field AC subtypes. Both arise postnatally and one is neither glycinergic nor GABAergic (nGnG). Two transcription factors selectively expressed by these subtypes, Neurod6 and special AT-rich-sequence-binding protein 2 (Satb2), regulate a postmitotic cell fate choice between these subtypes. Satb2 induces Neurod6, which persists in nGnG ACs and promotes their fate but is downregulated in the related glycinergic AC subtype. Our results support the view that cell fate decisions made in progenitors and their progeny act together to diversify ACs."
https://openalex.org/W1982502197,"Nucleus accumbens-1 (NAC1), a nuclear factor belonging to the BTB/POZ gene family, is known to have important roles in proliferation and growth of tumor cells and in chemotherapy resistance. Yet, the mechanisms underlying how NAC1 contributes to drug resistance remain largely unclear. We report here that autophagy was involved in NAC1-mediated resistance to cisplatin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug in the treatment of ovarian cancer. We found that treatment with cisplatin caused an activation of autophagy in ovarian cancer cell lines, A2780, OVCAR3 and SKOV3. We further demonstrated that knockdown of NAC1 by RNA interference or inactivation of NAC1 by inducing the expression of a NAC1 deletion mutant that contains only the BTB/POZ domain significantly inhibited the cisplatin-induced autophagy, resulting in increased cisplatin cytotoxicity. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy and sensitization to cisplatin by NAC1 knockdown or inactivation were accompanied by induction of apoptosis. To confirm that the sensitizing effect of NAC1 inhibition on the cytotoxicity of cisplatin was attributed to suppression of autophagy, we assessed the effects of the autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenosine and chloroquine, and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting beclin 1 or Atg5 on the cytotoxicity of cisplatin. Treatment with 3-methyladenosine, chloroquine or beclin 1 and Atg5-targeted siRNA also enhanced the sensitivity of SKOV3, A2780 and OVCAR3 cells to cisplatin, indicating that suppression of autophagy indeed renders tumor cells more sensitive to cisplatin. Regulation of autophagy by NAC1 was mediated by the high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), as the functional status of NAC1 was associated with the expression, translocation and release of HMGB1. The results of our study not only revealed a new mechanism determining cisplatin sensitivity but also identified NAC1 as a novel regulator of autophagy. Thus, the NAC1-mediated autophagy may be exploited as a new target for enhancing the efficacy of cisplatin against ovarian cancer and other types of malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2062316045,"Identification and characterization of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in gastric cancer are difficult owing to the lack of specific markers and consensus methods. In this study, we show that cells with the CD90 surface marker in gastric tumors could be enriched under non-adherent, serum-free and sphere-forming conditions. These CD90+ cells possess a higher ability to initiate tumor in vivo and could re-establish the cellular hierarchy of tumors from single-cell implantation, demonstrating their self-renewal properties. Interestingly, higher proportion of CD90+ cells correlates with higher in vivo tumorigenicity of gastric primary tumor models. In addition, it was found that ERBB2 was overexpressed in about 25% of the gastric primary tumor models, which correlates with the higher level of CD90 expression in these tumors. Trastuzumab (humanized anti-ERBB2 antibody) treatment of high-tumorigenic gastric primary tumor models could reduce the CD90+ population in tumor mass and suppress tumor growth when combined with traditional chemotherapy. Moreover, tumorigenicity of tumor cells could also be suppressed when trastuzumab treatment starts at the same time as cell implantation. Therefore, we have identified a CSC population in gastric primary tumors characterized by their CD90 phenotype. The finding that trastuzumab targets the CSC population in gastric tumors suggests that ERBB2 signaling has a role in maintaining CSC populations, thus contributing to carcinogenesis and tumor invasion. In conclusion, the results from this study provide new insights into the gastric tumorigenic process and offer potential implications for the development of anticancer drugs as well as therapeutic treatment of gastric cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2132733162,"Several diseases of the nervous system are characterized by neurodegeneration and death in childhood. Conventional medicine is ineffective, but fetal or neonatal gene therapy may provide an alternative route to treatment. We evaluated the ability of single-stranded and self-complementary adeno-associated virus pseudotype 2/9 (AAV2/9) to transduce the nervous system and target gene expression to specific neural cell types following intravenous injection into fetal and neonatal mice, using control uninjected age-matched mice. Fetal and neonatal administration produced global delivery to the central (brain, spinal cord, and all layers of the retina) and peripheral (myenteric plexus and innervating nerves) nervous system but with different expression profiles within the brain; fetal and neonatal administration resulted in expression in neurons and protoplasmic astrocytes, respectively. Neither single-stranded nor self-complementary AAV2/9 triggered a microglia-mediated immune response following either administration. In summary, intravenous AAV2/9 targets gene expression to specific neural cell types dependent on developmental stage. This represents a powerful tool for studying nervous system development and disease. Furthermore, it may provide a therapeutic strategy for treatment of early lethal genetic diseases, such as Gaucher disease, and for disabling neuropathies, such as preterm brain injury."

In particular, we demonstrate that SATB1 is not only a direct target of FOXP3 repression, but that FOXP3 also induces two miRs, miR-7 and miR-155, which specifically target the 3′-UTR of SATB1 to further regulate its expression. We conclude that FOXP3-regulated miRs form part of the mechanism by which FOXP3 prevents the transformation of the healthy breast epithelium to a cancerous phenotype. Approaches aimed at restoring FOXP3 function and the miRs it regulates could help provide new approaches to target breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2059243506,"Fibulin-2 (FBLN2) has been identified as a candidate tumor-suppressor gene in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Originally identified through a chromosome 3 NotI genomic microarray screen, it shows frequent deletion or methylation in NPC. FBLN2 is located on chromosome 3p25.1 and is associated with tumor development through its important interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. FBLN2 encodes two isoforms. The short isoform (FBLN2S) is expressed abundantly in normal tissues, but is dramatically downregulated in NPC, while the long isoform (FBLN2L) is either not detectable or is expressed only at low levels in both normal and tumor tissues. Reintroduction of this FBLN2S inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo studies in nude mice show its expression is associated with tumor and angiogenesis suppression. FBLN2-associated angiogenesis occurs via concomitant downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase 2. This study provides compelling evidence that FBLN2S has an important tumor-suppressive and anti-angiogenic role in NPC."

VEGFD expression is dependent upon basal neuronal activity and requires nuclear calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) signaling.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 4420-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, nuclear calcium-regulated processes required for memory formation are unknown. Here we considered the possibility that nuclear calcium signaling modulates structural features of neurons, in particular the complexity of the dendritic arbor, that determine their ability to receive and process inputs (Cline and Haas, 2008Cline H.

Physiol. 2008; 586: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV), a target of calcium in the nucleus (Chow et al., 2005Chow F.A. Anderson K.A. Noeldner P.K. Means A.R. The autonomous activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV is required for its role in transcription.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20530-20538Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), has been implicated in the regulation of dendritic growth and spine remodeling (Redmond et al., 2002Redmond L. Kashani A.H.

Generation of silent synapses by acute in vivo expression of CaMKIV and CREB.Neuron. 2005; 45: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), suggesting that nuclear calcium may represent an important signal in these processes. In this study we identify vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGFD), a mitogen for endothelial cells and regulator of angiogenesis and lymphatic vasculature (Lohela et al., 2009Lohela M. Bry M. Tammela T. Alitalo K. VEGFs and receptors involved in angiogenesis versus lymphangiogenesis.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), as a target of nuclear calcium-CaMKIV signaling in hippocampal neurons. We also show that VEGFD is required for the maintenance of a complex dendritic arbor and provides the molecular link between neuronal activity, the regulation of dendritic geometry, and cognitive functioning. To investigate the role of nuclear calcium signaling in the regulation of dendrite architecture, we expressed CaMBP4 in the nuclei of hippocampal neurons. This protein contains four repeats of the M13 calmodulin (CaM) binding peptide derived from the rabbit skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (Wang et al., 1995Wang J. Campos B. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Functional elimination of calmodulin within the nucleus by targeted expression of an inhibitor peptide.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30245-30248Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CaMBP4 effectively inactivates the nuclear calcium/CaM complex and blocks genomic responses induced by nuclear calcium signaling (Zhang et al., 2007Zhang S.J. Steijaert M.N. Lau D. Schütz G.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4279-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Morphometric analyses revealed that, compared to control, hippocampal neurons expressing CaMBP4 along with humanized Renilla reniformis green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) to visualize the cells showed a significant decrease both in the total dendritic length and in the complexity of the dendrites assessed by Sholl analysis (Figures 1A–1C ). Expression of CaMBP4 also caused a significant decrease in dendritic spine density (Figures 1D and 1E) and a considerable shortening and thinning of the remaining spines (Figures 1F and 1G). A similar reduction in total dendritic length, dendritic complexity, spine size, and spine density was observed in hippocampal neurons expressing CaMKIVK75E, a dominant negative mutant of CaMKIV (Anderson et al., 1997Anderson K.A. Ribar T.J. Illario M. Means A.R. Defective survival and activation of thymocytes in transgenic mice expressing a catalytically inactive form of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV.Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). These results indicate that nuclear calcium is an important signal in the control of dendritic geometry and spine density. We next aimed at identifying nuclear calcium/CaMKIV-regulated genes that mediate the observed structural changes. Examination of transcriptome data obtained from hippocampal neurons expressing CaMBP4 (Zhang et al., 2009Zhang S.J. Zou M. Lu L. Lau D. Ditzel D.A. Delucinge-Vivier C. Aso Y. Descombes P. Bading H. Nuclear calcium signaling controls expression of a large gene pool: identification of a gene program for acquired neuroprotection induced by synaptic activity.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000604Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) drew our attention to VEGFD (also known as Fos-induced growth factor) (Lohela et al., 2009Lohela M. Bry M. Tammela T. Alitalo K. VEGFs and receptors involved in angiogenesis versus lymphangiogenesis.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). VEGFD is well known for its role in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in healthy tissues and in several types of cancer (Achen and Stacker, 2008Achen M.G. Stacker S.A. Molecular control of lymphatic metastasis.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2008; 1131: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). VEGFD is detectable in the nervous system (http://www.brain-map.org/; Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S. Byrnes E.J. et al.Genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the adult mouse brain.Nature. 2007; 445: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3149) Google Scholar) but a function for this secreted factor in neurons has not been described, although two other VEGF family members, VEGF (also known as VEGFA) and VEGFC, have been implicated in neurogenesis and the maturation of newly born neurons (Cao et al., 2004Cao L. Jiao X. Zuzga D.S. Liu Y. Fong D.M. Young D. During M.J. VEGF links hippocampal activity with neurogenesis, learning and memory.Nat.

VEGF is required for dendritogenesis of newly born olfactory bulb interneurons.Development. 2010; 137: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (QRT-PCR) analysis revealed that VEGFD is expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons and reaches peak levels of expression after a culturing period of 10–13 days (Figure 2A and Figure S1A, available online). VEGFD mRNA and protein are detectable in cultured neurons and in vivo at different developmental stages in the mouse hippocampus and cortex (Figures S1C–S1F). VEGFD expression is significantly lower in hippocampal neurons infected with a recombinant adenoassociated virus (rAAV) containing an expression cassette for either CaMBP4 (rAAV-CaMBP4) or CaMKIVK75E (rAAV-CaMKIVK75E) than in uninfected neurons or in neurons infected with an rAAV-expressing LacZ (rAAV-LacZ) (Figure 2B and Figure S1A). The expression levels of many other genes, including other members of the VEGF family, were not affected by CaMBP4 or CaMKIVK75E (Zhang et al., 2009Zhang S.J. Zou M. Lu L. Lau D. Ditzel D.A. Delucinge-Vivier C. Aso Y. Descombes P. Bading H. Nuclear calcium signaling controls expression of a large gene pool: identification of a gene program for acquired neuroprotection induced by synaptic activity.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000604Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) (Figure S1B). The neurotropism of our rAAVs specifically targets neurons over glia (Xu et al., 2001Xu R. Janson C.G. Mastakov M. Lawlor P. Young D. Mouravlev A. Fitzsimons H. Choi K.L. Ma H. Dragunow M. et al.Quantitative comparison of expression with adeno-associated virus (AAV-2) brain-specific gene cassettes.Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) indicating that the modulation of VEGFD expression is restricted to neurons. To investigate a possible contribution of neuronal activity to VEGFD expression, we treated cultured hippocampal neurons with TTX for 5 days (from day in vitro [DIV] 5 until the time point of gene expression analysis on DIV 10). We found that compared to controls, this treatment reduced expression of VEGFD and also that of cFos, a well-characterized neuronal activity marker (Figure 2C). For several other genes analyzed in parallel we found no differences in expression levels after TTX treatment (Figure 2C). Given the prolonged duration of the TTX treatment, we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed reduction in VEGFD expression may be caused indirectly through secondary effects. To determine if VEGFD mRNA levels are affected by an increase in synaptic activity, we exposed hippocampal neurons to the GABAA receptor blocker bicuculline. This treatment relieves tonic, GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition of synaptic transmission from the hippocampal network and induces bursts of action potentials (APs) (Hardingham et al., 2001Hardingham G.E. Arnold F.J. Bading H. Nuclear calcium signaling controls CREB-mediated gene expression triggered by synaptic activity.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, Arnold et al., 2005Arnold F.J. Hofmann F. Bengtson C.P. Wittmann M. Vanhoutte P. Bading H. Microelectrode array recordings of cultured hippocampal networks reveal a simple model for transcription and protein synthesis-dependent plasticity.J. Physiol. 2005; 564: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Bicuculline treatment caused a robust induction of cFos mRNA but did not alter VEGFC or VEGFD mRNA levels (Figure 2D). To investigate the involvement of NMDA receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels in VEGFD expression, we treated hippocampal neurons with the NMDA receptor blocker MK801 and/or nifedipine, a blocker of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Both MK801 and nifedipine significantly reduced the expression of VEGFD mRNA; treatment with a combination of both channel blockers yielded the largest reduction in VEGFD mRNA levels (Figure 2E). These results indicate that VEGFD expression is controlled by basal neuronal activity through a mechanism that is initiated by NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels and requires nuclear calcium-CaMKIV signaling. Because the observed reduction of VEGFD mRNA levels after inhibition of nuclear calcium signaling could be due to a change in VEGFD mRNA stability, we next determined the half-life of VEGFD mRNA. The levels of VEGFD mRNA and in parallel those of cFos were measured in both uninfected and rAAV-CaMBP4-infected hippocampal neurons before and at various time points (0.5–24 hr) after treatment of the cells with actinomycin D, an inhibitor of gene transcription. We found that VEGFD mRNA has a half-life of more than 24 hr in uninfected hippocampal neurons; a virtually identical decay rate for VEGFD was observed in rAAV-CaMBP4-infected neurons (Figure 2F), although compared to uninfected controls, the absolute amounts of VEGFD mRNA in these neurons were lower (see also Figure 2B and Figure S1A). Analysis of cFos mRNA revealed a half-life of less than 1 hr (Figure 2F), which is in agreement with other studies (Schiavi et al., 1992Schiavi S.C. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Regulation of proto-oncogene mRNA stability.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the regulation of VEGFD expression by nuclear calcium signaling takes place at the level of gene transcription rather than at the posttranscriptional level. In silico analysis with the Transcription Element Search System (TESS; http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/tess/tess) of a 2000 base pairs-long upstream regulatory region of the murine VEGFD gene revealed a large number of possible binding sites for several transcription factors including the AP-1 complex, NF-AT, MEF-2, HiNF, NF-κB, POU2-Oct, and HNF4. However, a cAMP response element (CRE) appears to be lacking, suggesting that nuclear calcium-CaMKIV-mediated regulation of VEGFD takes place by transcription factors other than CREB, the prototypical target of this signaling pathway (Hardingham et al., 1997Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Distinct functions of nuclear and cytoplasmic calcium in the control of gene expression.Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, Hardingham et al., 2001Hardingham G.E. Arnold F.J. Bading H. Nuclear calcium signaling controls CREB-mediated gene expression triggered by synaptic activity.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Because the activity of the transcriptional coactivator CBP is controlled by nuclear calcium and CaMKIV (Chawla et al., 1998Chawla S. Hardingham G.E. Quinn D.R. Bading H. CBP: a signal-regulated transcriptional coactivator controlled by nuclear calcium and CaM kinase IV.Science. 1998; 281: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), we next tested the role of CBP in VEGFD regulation. CBP interacts with a variety of transcription factors (Bedford et al., 2010Bedford D.C. Kasper L.H. Fukuyama T. Brindle P.K. Target gene context influences the transcriptional requirement for the KAT3 family of CBP and p300 histone acetyltransferases.Epigenetics. 2010; 5: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), which includes some of those for which putative binding sites have been identified in the VEGFD gene (see above). Moreover, a contribution of CBP to the regulation of the human VEGFD promoter in cancer cells has been suggested (Schäfer et al., 2008Schäfer G. Wissmann C. Hertel J. Lunyak V. Höcker M. Regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor D by orphan receptors hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors 1 and 2.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To directly investigate a possible role of CBP in the regulation of the endogenous VEGFD gene in hippocampal neurons, we infected the neurons with an rAAV expressing the adenovirus protein E1A. E1A binds to CBP via its amino terminal-conserved region 1 (CR1) and disrupts CBP function (Arany et al., 1995Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R.

Kouzarides T. CBP-induced stimulation of c-Fos activity is abrogated by E1A.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). As expected, rAAV-mediated expression of E1A blocked the AP bursting-induced increase in the expression of cFos (Figure 2G), a known target of the CREB/CBP transcription factor complex (Chawla et al., 1998Chawla S. Hardingham G.E. Quinn D.R. Bading H.

Expression of E1A also significantly reduced VEGFD mRNA levels (Figure 2G). Infection of hippocampal neurons with an rAAV expressing a mutant version of E1A (E1AΔCR1) that lacks CR1 and fails to interact with CBP (Arany et al., 1995Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E.

CBP-induced stimulation of c-Fos activity is abrogated by E1A.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) had no effect on cFos regulation or VEGFD transcription (Figure 2G). We also used RNA interference (RNAi) to specifically decrease CBP mRNA levels in hippocampal neurons (Figure 2H). This caused a significant reduction of VEGFD mRNA levels (Figure 2H) confirming the role of CBP in modulating VEGFD transcription. A morphometric analysis revealed that hippocampal neurons expressing E1A have shorter and simplified dendritic trees compared to neurons expressing E1AΔCR1 (Figures 2I and 2J). These results indicate that CBP acts downstream of nuclear calcium-CaMKIV signaling to regulate VEGFD expression in hippocampal neurons. To investigate whether VEGFD is involved in mediating the effects of nuclear calcium-CaMKIV signaling on neuronal structure, we either transfected or infected hippocampal neurons, respectively, with an rAAV plasmid (pAAV-VEGFD) or an rAAV (rAAV-VEGFD) containing an expression cassette for HA-tagged VEGFD or we treated the neurons with recombinant VEGFD (rVEGFD). Expression of HA-tagged VEGFD was detected immunocytochemically and by immunoblotting in rAAV-VEGFD-infected hippocampal neurons and in the culture media (Figures S1G and S1H). Although VEGFD-HA expression or exogenously applied rVEGFD had no detectable effect on neuronal morphology, both treatments rescued the reduction in dendrite length and complexity caused by expression of CaMBP4 or CaMKIVK75E (Figures 3A–3C, 3E, and 3F ). In contrast, VEGFD-HA and rVEGFD failed to restore normal spine density in CaMBP4 or CaMKIVK75E-expressing neurons (Figures 3D and 3G), indicating that the mechanisms through which nuclear calcium-CaMKIV signaling regulate dendrite geometry and spine density are distinct. Because VEGFD belongs to a family of closely related factors that in part share the receptors (Achen and Stacker, 2008Achen M.G. Stacker S.A. Molecular control of lymphatic metastasis.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2008; 1131: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), we tested whether VEGF or VEGFC also affect dendrite arborization. However, neither recombinant VEGF (rVEGF) nor recombinant VEGFC (rVEGFC) was able to rescue the reduction in dendrite length and complexity caused by CaMBP4 or CaMKIVK75E expression (Figure S2), indicating a specific role for VEGFD in the control of dendrite arborization by nuclear calcium-CaMKIV signaling. To determine whether the observed reduction in VEGFD expression that followed blockade of nuclear calcium-CaMKIV signaling is sufficient to alter dendritic architecture, we used RNAi to lower VEGFD expression in hippocampal neurons. DNA sequences encoding short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) designed to target the mouse VEGFD mRNA were inserted downstream of the U6 promoter of an rAAV vector. The resulting rAAV, rAAV-shVEGFD, also harbors a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) promoter-containing expression cassette for the red fluorescent protein, mCherry (Figure 4A ). Control rAAVs were identical to rAAV-shVEGFD except that they either lacked DNA sequences encoding shRNAs (rAAV-emptymC) or contained DNA sequences encoding a scrambled version of the VEGFD-specific shRNA (rAAV-shSCR). Infection rates of 80%–95% of the neuron population were obtained for all three rAAVs (Figures S3A and S3B). QRT-PCR and immunoblot analysis revealed that rAAV-shVEGFD, but not rAAV-shSCR or rAAV-emptymC, reduced VEGFD mRNA levels and blocked VEGFD protein expression (Figure 4B and Figure S3C). Expression of VEGFC was not affected by rAAV-shVEGFD or by the two control rAAVs (Figure 4B). It has been reported that expression of certain shRNAs can have an effect on neuronal morphology because of the induction of an interferon response (Alvarez et al., 2006Alvarez V.A."
https://openalex.org/W2111336104,"The ubiquitously expressed 14-3-3 proteins regulate many pathways involved in transformation. Previously, we found that 14-3-3ζ overexpression increased Akt phosphorylation in human mammary epithelial cells. Here, we investigated the clinical relevance and molecular mechanism of 14-3-3ζ-overexpression-mediated Akt phosphorylation, and its potential impact on breast cancer progression. We found that 14-3-3ζ overexpression was significantly (P=0.005) associated with increased Akt phosphorylation in human breast tumors. Additionally, 14-3-3ζ overexpression combined with strong Akt phosphorylation was significantly (P=0.01) associated with increased cancer recurrence in patients. In contrast, knockdown of 14-3-3ζ expression by small interfering RNA in cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts reduced Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, 14-3-3ζ enhanced Akt phosphorylation through activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Mechanistically, 14-3-3ζ bound to the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and increased PI3K translocation to the cell membrane. A single 14-3-3-binding motif encompassing serine 83 on p85 is largely responsible for 14-3-3ζ-mediated p85 binding and PI3K/Akt activation. Mutation of serine 83 to alanine on p85 inhibited 14-3-3ζ binding to the p85 subunit of PI3K, reduced PI3K membrane localization and activation, impeded anchorage-independent growth and enhanced stress-induced apoptosis. These findings revealed a novel mechanism by which 14-3-3ζ overexpression activates PI3K, a key node in the mitogenic signaling network known to promote malignancies in many cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2136905362,"Malarial parasites have evolved resistance to all previously used therapies, and recent evidence suggests emerging resistance to the first-line artemisinins. To identify antimalarials with novel mechanisms of action, we have developed a high-throughput screen targeting the apicoplast organelle of Plasmodium falciparum. Antibiotics known to interfere with this organelle, such as azithromycin, exhibit an unusual phenotype whereby the progeny of drug-treated parasites die. Our screen exploits this phenomenon by assaying for ""delayed death"" compounds that exhibit a higher potency after two cycles of intraerythrocytic development compared to one. We report a primary assay employing parasites with an integrated copy of a firefly luciferase reporter gene and a secondary flow cytometry-based assay using a nucleic acid stain paired with a mitochondrial vital dye. Screening of the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Collection identified known and novel antimalarials including kitasamycin. This inexpensive macrolide, used for agricultural applications, exhibited an in vitro IC(50) in the 50 nM range, comparable to the 30 nM activity of our control drug, azithromycin. Imaging and pharmacologic studies confirmed kitasamycin action against the apicoplast, and in vivo activity was observed in a murine malaria model. These assays provide the foundation for high-throughput campaigns to identify novel chemotypes for combination therapies to treat multidrug-resistant malaria."
https://openalex.org/W1985562221,"Although Caenorhabditis elegans has been utilized extensively to study synapse formation and function, relatively little is known about synaptic plasticity in C. elegans. We show that a brief treatment with the cholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb induces a form of presynaptic potentiation whereby ACh release at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) is doubled. Aldicarb-induced potentiation was eliminated by mutations that block processing of proneuropeptides, by mutations inactivating a single proneuropeptide (NLP-12), and by those inactivating an NLP-12 receptor (CKR-2). NLP-12 expression is limited to a single stretch-activated neuron, DVA. Analysis of a YFP-tagged NLP-12 suggests that aldicarb stimulates DVA secretion of NLP-12. Mutations disrupting the DVA mechanoreceptor (TRP-4) decreased aldicarb-induced NLP-12 secretion and blocked aldicarb-induced synaptic potentiation. Mutants lacking NLP-12 or CKR-2 have decreased locomotion rates. Collectively, these results suggest that NLP-12 mediates a mechanosensory feedback loop that couples muscle contraction to changes in presynaptic release, thereby providing a mechanism for proprioceptive control of locomotion."

https://openalex.org/W2040879146,"Thalamic afferents supply the cortex with sensory information by contacting both excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Interestingly, thalamic contacts with interneurons constitute such a powerful synapse that even one afferent can fire interneurons, thereby driving feedforward inhibition. However, the spatial representation of this potent synapse on interneuron dendrites is poorly understood. Using Ca imaging and electron microscopy we show that an individual thalamic afferent forms multiple contacts with the interneuronal proximal dendritic arbor, preferentially near branch points. More contacts are correlated with larger amplitude synaptic responses. Each contact, consisting of a single bouton, can release up to seven vesicles simultaneously, resulting in graded and reliable Ca transients. Computational modeling indicates that the release of multiple vesicles at each contact minimally reduces the efficiency of the thalamic afferent in exciting the interneuron. This strategy preserves the spatial representation of thalamocortical inputs across the dendritic arbor over a wide range of release conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2120616795,"Cell transplantation has been well explored for cartilage regeneration. We recently showed that the entire articular surface of a synovial joint can regenerate by endogenous cell homing and without cell transplantation. However, the sources of endogenous cells that regenerate articular cartilage remain elusive. Here, we studied whether cytokines not only chemotactically recruit adipose stem cells (ASCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and synovium stem cells (SSCs) but also induce chondrogenesis of the recruited cells. Recombinant human transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3; 100 ng) and/or recombinant human stromal derived factor-1β (SDF-1β; 100 ng) was control released into an acellular collagen sponge cube with underlying ASCs, MSCs, or SSCs in monolayer culture. Although all cell types randomly migrated into the acellular collagen sponge cube, TGF-β3 and/or SDF-1β recruited significantly more cells than the cytokine-free control group. In 6 wk, TGF-β3 alone recruited substantial numbers of ASCs (558±65) and MSCs (302±52), whereas codelivery of TGF-β3 and SDF-1β was particularly chemotactic to SSCs (400±120). Proliferation of the recruited cells accounted for some, but far from all, of the observed cellularity. TGF-β3 and SDF-1β codelivery induced significantly higher aggrecan gene expression than the cytokine-free group for ASCs, MSCs, and SSCs. Type II collagen gene expression was also significantly higher for ASCs and SSCs by SDF-1 and TGF-β3 codelivery. Remarkably, the expression of aggrecan and type II collagen was detected among all cell types. Thus, homing of multiple stem/progenitor cell populations may potentially serve as an alternative or adjunctive approach to cell transplantation for cartilage regeneration.—Mendelson, A., Frank, E., Allred, C., Jones, E., Chen, M., Zhao, W., Mao, J.

https://openalex.org/W2018716739,"A large fraction of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a non-invasive precursor lesion of invasive breast cancer, overexpresses the HER2/neu oncogene. The ducts of DCIS are abnormally filled with cells that evade apoptosis, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We overexpressed HER2 in mammary epithelial cells and observed growth factor-independent proliferation. When grown in extracellular matrix as three-dimensional spheroids, control cells developed a hollow lumen, but HER2-overexpressing cells populated the lumen by evading apoptosis. We demonstrate that HER2 overexpression in this cellular model of DCIS drives transcriptional upregulation of multiple components of the Notch survival pathway. Importantly, luminal filling required upregulation of a signaling pathway comprising Notch3, its cleaved intracellular domain and the transcriptional regulator HES1, resulting in elevated levels of c-MYC and cyclin D1. In line with HER2-Notch3 collaboration, drugs intercepting either arm reverted the DCIS-like phenotype. In addition, we report upregulation of Notch3 in hyperplastic lesions of HER2 transgenic animals, as well as an association between HER2 levels and expression levels of components of the Notch pathway in tumor specimens of breast cancer patients. Therefore, it is conceivable that the integration of the Notch and HER2 signaling pathways contributes to the pathophysiology of DCIS."
https://openalex.org/W2060008535,"Cell surface Ig superfamily proteins (IgSF) have been implicated in several aspects of neuron development and function. Here, we describe the function of a Caenorhabditis elegans IgSF protein, RIG-3. Mutants lacking RIG-3 have an exaggerated paralytic response to a cholinesterase inhibitor, aldicarb. Although RIG-3 is expressed in motor neurons, heightened drug responsiveness was caused by an aldicarb-induced increase in muscle ACR-16 acetylcholine receptor (AChR) abundance, and a corresponding potentiation of postsynaptic responses at neuromuscular junctions. Mutants lacking RIG-3 also had defects in the anteroposterior polarity of the ALM mechanosensory neurons. The effects of RIG-3 on synaptic transmission and ALM polarity were both mediated by changes in Wnt signaling, and in particular by inhibiting CAM-1, a Ror-type receptor tyrosine kinase that binds Wnt ligands. These results identify RIG-3 as a regulator of Wnt signaling, and suggest that RIG-3 has an anti-plasticity function that prevents activity-induced changes in postsynaptic receptor fields."
https://openalex.org/W2088953432,"Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) is a key enzyme that couples with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) for the production of PGE2. Although COX-2 is known to mediate the growth and progression of several human cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the role of mPGES-1 in hepatocarcinogenesis is not well established. This study provides novel evidence for a key role of mPGES-1 in HCC growth and progression. Forced overexpression of mPGES-1 in two HCC cell lines (Hep3B and Huh7) increased tumor cell growth, clonogenic formation, migration and invasion, whereas knockdown of mPGES-1 inhibited these parameters, in vitro. In a mouse tumor xenograft model, mPGES-1-overexpressed cells formed palpable tumors at earlier time points and developed larger tumors when compared with the control (P<0.01); in contrast, mPGES-1 knockdown delayed tumor development and reduced tumor size (P<0.01). Mechanistically, mPGES-1-induced HCC cell proliferation, invasion and migration involve PGE2 production and activation of early growth response 1 (EGR1) and β-catenin. Specifically, mPGES-1-derived PGE2 induces the formation of EGR1-β-catenin complex, which interacts with T-cell factor 4/lymphoid enhancer factor 1 transcription factors and activates the expression of β-catenin downstream genes. Our findings depict a novel crosstalk between mPGES-1/PGE2 and EGR1/β-catenin signaling that is critical for hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2161529695,"γ-Secretase catalyzes the cleavage of the intramembrane region of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP), generating p3, amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). Although a γ-secretase inhibitor has been shown to cause an accumulation of the APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) α and β and to decrease levels of p3 or Aβ and AICD, we found that treatment with a lysosomotropic weak base, such as chloroquine or ammonium chloride, caused simultaneous accumulation of both CTFs and AICD, suggesting that lysosomal proteases are also involved in processing of APP. This observation was reinforced by the results that cysteine protease inhibitor E-64d and cathepsin B specific inhibitor CA-074Me caused the accumulation of both CTFs and AICD with no change in known secretase activities. γ-Secretase preferentially cleaved phosphorylated CTFs to produce Aβ, but cathepsin B degraded CTFs regardless of phosphorylation. Our results suggest that cathepsin B plays novel roles in the metabolism of APP and that an inhibition of APP phosphorylation is an attractive therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.—Asai, M., Yagishita, S., Iwata, N., Saido, T.

https://openalex.org/W2093519279,"The serine/threonine kinase Akt is frequently activated in human cancers and is considered an attractive therapeutic target. However, the relative contributions of the different Akt isoforms to tumorigenesis, and the effect of their deficiencies on cancer development are not well understood. We had previously shown that Akt1 deficiency is sufficient to markedly reduce the incidence of tumors in Pten(+/-) mice. Particularly, Akt1 deficiency inhibits endometrial carcinoma and prostate neoplasia in Pten(+/-) mice. Here, we analyzed the effect of Akt2 deficiency on the incidence of tumors in Pten(+/-) mice. Relative to Akt1, Akt2 deficiency had little-to-no effect on the incidence of prostate neoplasia, endometrial carcinoma, intestinal polyps and adrenal lesions in Pten(+/-) mice. However, Akt2 deficiency significantly decreased the incidence of thyroid tumors in Pten(+/-), which correlates with the relatively high level of Akt2 expression in the thyroid. Thus, unlike Akt1 deletion, Akt2 deletion is not sufficient to markedly inhibit tumorigenesis in Pten(+/-) mice in most tested tissues. The relatively small effect of Akt2 deletion on the inhibition of tumorigenesis in Pten(+/-) mice could be explained, in part, by an insufficient decrease in total Akt activity, due to the relatively lower Akt2 versus Akt1 expression, and relatively high blood insulin levels in Pten(+/-)Akt2(-/-) mice. The relatively high blood insulin levels in Pten(+/-)Akt2(-/-) mice may elevate the activity of Akt1, and possibly Akt3, thus, limiting the reduction of total Akt activity and preventing this activity from dropping to a threshold level required to inhibit tumorigenesis."

Oral administration of HB (20 or 60 mg/kg/d for 24 d) to healthy rats fed normal diet (protein content 23.9%) increased food intake, body weight gain, lean body mass, and gastrocnemius muscle mass as compared with vehicle-treated controls. The effect of HB administration increased slightly in animals fed a high-protein diet (protein content 39.4%). Both oral (up to 60 mg/kg) and subcutaneous (up to 4 mg/kg) administration of HB showed low androgenic activity when tested in the Hershberger assay. Moreover, HB showed no direct binding to the androgen receptor in vitro. HB treatment was also associated with an improved physical fitness of untrained healthy rats, as evident from a 6.7% increase in lower extremity strength, measured by grip test. In the gastrocnemius muscle of castrated animals, HB treatment significantly increased the number of type IIa and IIb fibers and the cross-sectional area of type I and type IIa fibers. These findings suggest that oral application of HB triggers selective anabolic response with minimal or no androgenic side-effects and begin to elucidate the putative cellular targets for plant brassinosteroids in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2119497830,"Retinal ganglion cells adapt by reducing their sensitivity during periods of high contrast. Contrast adaptation in the firing response depends on both presynaptic and intrinsic mechanisms. Here, we investigated intrinsic mechanisms for contrast adaptation in OFF Alpha ganglion cells in the in vitro guinea pig retina. Using either visual stimulation or current injection, we show that brief depolarization evoked spiking and suppressed firing during subsequent depolarization. The suppression could be explained by Na channel inactivation, as shown in salamander cells. However, brief hyperpolarization in the physiological range (5-10 mV) also suppressed firing during subsequent depolarization. This suppression was selectively sensitive to blockers of delayed-rectifier K channels (K(DR)). In somatic membrane patches, we observed tetraethylammonium-sensitive K(DR) currents that activated near -25 mV. Recovery from inactivation occurred at potentials hyperpolarized to V(rest). Brief periods of hyperpolarization apparently remove K(DR) inactivation and thereby increase the channel pool available to suppress excitability during subsequent depolarization."
https://openalex.org/W1987585655,"One of the defining features of aggressive melanomas is their complexity. Hundreds of mutations and an ever increasing list of changes in the transcriptome and proteome distinguish normal from malignant melanocytic cells. Yet, despite this altered genetic background, a long-known attribute of melanomas is a relatively low rate of mutations in the p53 gene. However, it is unclear whether p53 is maintained in melanoma cells because it is required for their survival, or because it is functionally disabled. More pressing from a translational perspective, is to define whether there is a tumor cell-selective wiring of p53 that offers a window for therapeutic intervention. Here, we provide genetic and pharmacological evidence demonstrating that p53 represents a liability to melanoma cells, which they thwart by assuming an oncogenic dependency on the E3 ligase murine double minute-2 (MDM2). Specifically, we used a combination of RNA interference and two structurally independent small molecule inhibitors of the p53–MDM2 interaction to assess the relative requirement of both proteins for the viability of normal melanocytes and a broad panel of melanoma cell lines. We demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that MDM2 is selectively required to blunt latent pro-senescence signals in melanoma cells. Notably, the outcome of MDM2 inactivation depends not only on the mutational status of p53, but also on its ability to signal to the transcription factor E2F1. These data support MDM2 as a drug target in melanoma cells, and identify E2F1 as a biomarker to consider when stratifying putative candidates for clinical studies of p53–MDM2 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2156883659,"Reverse signaling through the ephrinB ligands is important for several morphogenetic events, such as axon guidance, neuronal plasticity, spine maturation, and synaptogenesis. Signaling is initiated by binding of EphB receptors to ephrinB ligands, stimulating their tyrosine phosphorylation via an unclear mechanism. Here we show that this mechanism involves presenilin1 (PS1)/γ-secretase regulation of phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains/Csk binding protein (PAG/Cbp), an adaptor protein that controls the activity of Src kinases. Using immunoprecipitation and Western blot of mouse primary neuronal and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell extracts overexpressing PAG/Cbp, we show that EphB2 induces tyrosine dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp in a γ-secretase-dependent manner. In these cells, PAG/Cbp dephosphorylation is promoted by the PS1/-y-secretase-produced fragment of ephrinB2 cleavage (ephrinB2/CTF2), which forms complexes with PAG/Cbp when introduced exogenously. EphB2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ephrinB2 depends on PAG/Cbp because EphB2 cannot increase ephrinB2 phosphorylation in cells treated with anti-PAG siRNA or in PAG/Cbp-knockout (KO) cells. Furthermore, in contrast to WT PS1, familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) PS1 mutants expressed in PS1-KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts inhibited both the EphB2-induced dephosphorylation of PAG/Cbp and the phosphorylation of ephrinB2. PS1 FAD mutations may thus inhibit the function of ephrinB in the brain, promoting neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease.—Georgakopoulos, A., Xu, J., Xu, C., Mauger, G., Barthet, G., Robakis, N. K.

https://openalex.org/W2099543649,"The highly immunogenic human tumor antigen NY-ESO-1 (ESO) is a target of choice for anti-cancer immune therapy. In this study, we assessed spontaneous antibody (Ab) responses to ESO in a large cohort of patients with primary breast cancer (BC) and addressed the correlation between the presence of anti-ESO Ab, the expression of ESO in the tumors and their characteristics. We found detectable Ab responses to ESO in 1% of the patients. Tumors from patients with circulating Ab to ESO exhibited common characteristics, being mainly hormone receptor (HR)⁻ invasive ductal carcinomas of high grade, including both HER2⁻ and HER2⁺ tumors. In line with these results, we detected ESO expression in 20% of primary HR⁻ BC, including both ESO Ab⁺ and Ab⁻ patients, but not in HR⁺ BC. Interestingly, whereas expression levels in ESO⁺ BC were not significantly different between ESO Ab⁺ and Ab⁻ patients, the former had, in average, significantly higher numbers of tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes, indicating that lymph node invasion may be required for the development of spontaneous anti-tumor immune responses. Thus, the presence of ESO Ab identifies a tumor subtype of HR⁻ (HER2⁻ or HER2⁺) primary BC with frequent ESO expression and, together with the assessment of antigen expression in the tumor, may be instrumental for the selection of patients for whom ESO-based immunotherapy may complement standard therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2004629447,"Constitutive telomerase activity maintains telomere length and confers immortal phenotypes to human cancers. The prevalence of telomerase, rather than a homologous recombination-based mechanism, in telomere length maintenance suggests that telomerase also has auxiliary roles in tumorigenesis. Here, we investigate growth advantages provided by the telomerase enzyme in oncogene-transformed human cells that do not require telomerase activity for telomere length control. Our data suggest that in oncogene-transformed cells, telomerase activity accelerates cell growth kinetics in a cell cycle phase-specific manner and promotes anchorage-independent growth. Coculture experiments demonstrated that this growth advantage conferred by telomerase activity is not due to increased cellular cross-talk. Growth advantages provided by telomerase required all functional aspects of the enzyme. Dissociation-of-activity-in-telomerase mutants and other functionally defective versions of telomerase were unable to promote oncogene-transformed cell growth, suggesting that canonical telomerase activities may be involved. We conclude that telomerase provides advantages to oncogene-transformed human cells, thereby supporting the development of telomerase-based anticancer chemotherapies targeting these growth-promoting effects."

https://openalex.org/W2067148555,"Background Positive family history of stroke is an independent risk factor for lacunar stroke. However, the magnitude of familial aggregation of a certain disease is better evaluated by the genetic relative risk. This is calculated by dividing the prevalence of specific disease in family members of patients by the prevalence of this disease in the general population. In a cohort of lacunar stroke patients, who were subtyped clinically and radiologically, we determined the genetic relative risk of stroke. Methods By questionnaire and additional interview, we obtained a complete first-degree family history of stroke. The prevalence of stroke in first-degree relatives of these lacunar stroke patients was compared to the self-reported prevalence of stroke in a Dutch community based cohort of elderly volunteers. Secondly, the influence of proband characteristics and family composition on parental and sibling history of stroke were evaluated. Principal Findings We collected data of 1066 first-degree relatives of 195 lacunar stroke patients. Strokes occurred in 13.5% of first-degree relatives. The genetic relative risk was 2.94 (95%CI 2.45–3.53) for overall first-degree relatives, 4.52 (95%CI 3.61–5.65) for patients' parents and 2.10 (95%CI 1.63–2.69) for patients' siblings. Age of proband and proband status for hypertension influenced the chance of having a parent with a history of stroke whereas the likelihood of having a concordant sibling increased with sibship size. Conclusions We found an increased genetic relative risk of stroke in first-degree relatives of patients with lacunar stroke. Our data warrant further genomic research in this well-defined high risk population for stroke."
