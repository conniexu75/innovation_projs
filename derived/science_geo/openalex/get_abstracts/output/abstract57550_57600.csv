https://openalex.org/W2081417241,"Bats of the family Vespertilionidae emit strong ultrasonic pulses for echolocation. If such sounds directly stimulate their ears, the detection of echoes from short distances would be impaired. The responses of lateral lemniscal neurons to emitted sounds were found to be much smaller than those to playback sounds, even when the response of the auditory nerve was the same to both types of sounds. Thus, responses to self-vocalized sounds were attenuated between the cochlear nerve and the inferior colliculus. The mean attenuation was 25 decibels. This neural attenuating mechanism is probably a part of the mechanisms for effective echo detection."

https://openalex.org/W1585532500,"Abstract The amino acid sequence of ovine luteinizing hormone β-subunit has been determined using three treatment schedules for the intact subunit to provide suitable subfractions for sequence study. In one treatment schedule cyanogen bromide cleavage, fractionation, reduction, and S-carboxymethylation was used; in a second, the tryptic peptides were isolated after digestion of reduced, S-carboxymethylated subunit. In a third procedure, the subunit was succinylated, reduced, S-carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. Although the third procedure blocked only 2 lysine residues to tryptic attack (positions 20 and 42) the minor cleavages by trypsin in the region of residues 27 to 42 were less troublesome and provided adequate yield of the peptides to establish this portion of the sequence. Application of the Edman degradation and COOH-terminal determinations to the peptides thus obtained allowed placement of all 119 amino acid residues of the subunit in sequence. The sequence determined in this report differs from that proposed in a brief communication by Papkoff et al. ((1971) J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 93, 1531) in the inversion of 17 amino acid residues and the placement of 1 more proline residue in their sequence. The sequence determined in the present report for ovine LH-β is in agreement with that suggested for bovine LH-β by Maghuin-Rogister and Dockier (1971) (Fed. Eur. Biochem. Soc. Lett. 19, 209) although the latter authors have 4 residues of 119 which have not been placed in sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1576262326,"Abstract The histidine-binding protein J, previously shown to be involved in histidine transport in Salmonella typhimurium (Ames, G. F., and Lever, J. (1970) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 66, 1096), is shown unequivocally to be the product of the hisJ gene. A hisJ mutant with an altered J protein and a correspondingly altered histidine transport has been isolated and characterized. The J protein from this strain has an increased temperature sensitivity, besides having altered chromatographic and electrophoretic mobilities. The in vivo effect of the altered J protein is expressed as an increased temperature sensitivity of histidine transport. Our data indicate that the hisJ gene is the structural gene for the J protein and that the J protein is an obligatory component of histidine transport. As expected, there is an excellent correlation between the specificity of transport in the wild type strain and the specificity of binding of the wild type J protein for a variety of amino acids, amino acid analogues, and inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1491825834,"Abstract The purification of the J histidine-binding protein, a component of high affinity histidine transport in Salmonella typhimurium, is described. A mutant strain producing elevated levels of this protein is used as the optimal source of this protein. The purification involves a modified osmotic shock procedure, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, and isoelectric focusing. The final preparation is homogeneous by several criteria. The J protein has a molecular weight of 25,000 by gel filtration and 26,000 by sedimentation equilibrium. Histidine binding is reversible, with a dissociation constant for the J protein-histidine complex of 0.15 µm. The J protein at saturating substrate (10-6 m histidine) maximally binds 1 molecule of histidine per molecule protein. Histidine binding decreases slightly at high ionic strength, and decreases with increase in pH. Binding activity is relatively stable to boiling. The protein has an isoelectric pH of 5.5 and an amino acid composition representative of S. typhimurium protein. The J protein is located near the cell surface, as indicated by its release by osmotic shock and during spheroplast formation. The J protein has no detectable enzymatic activity. In addition to the J protein, osmotic shock treatment releases three separable components which bind histidine."

https://openalex.org/W1968139539,"ONCE triggered by temperature and food stimuli, vitellogenesis in bivalve molluscs proceeds to completion in spite of suboptimal environmental conditions1,2. Following maturation, however, disintegration of gametes occurs unless further stimuli are received to initiate their release from the animal (spawning), which poses the question, how are the larvae that develop from gametes produced in sub-optimal conditions affected by the stress experienced by the adult?"

https://openalex.org/W1964869590,Panting in Sauromalus obesus is effective enough to keep deep body temperature (T(C)) and brain temperature (T(B)) below an ambient temperature of 45 degrees C for extended periods of time and has a greater cooling effect on the brain than on the remainder of the body. Six animals maintained T(C) and T(B) 0.9 degrees C (+/- 0.08 standard error) and 2.7 degrees C (+/- 0.2 standard error) respectively lower than the ambient temperature of 45 degrees C. It is possible that intracranial vascular shunts play a role in cranial cooling during panting.
https://openalex.org/W1987560818,"EXPOSURE of insect embryos to juvenile hormone or to any of its analogues can result in delayed effects which are realized later at metamorphosis1–5. These have been attributed to: (1) persistence of the applied hormone through larval life2; (2) interference with the overall programming of the embryo for postembryonic development1,3; and (3) the selective interference with the embryonic programming of the corpus allatum3,5,6. This study presents evidence that juvenile hormone disrupts the embryonic programming of the corpus allatum such that it does not cease secretion of the hormone as a prelude to metamorphosis."

https://openalex.org/W2035196788,"CELLS of both the reproductive and functional compartments of oral and cutaneous epithelia are at present indiscriminately called “keratinocytes”. The two types of cells, however, differ markedly in function and fate, and it is therefore logical, as well as useful, to distinguish them by different terms. It is therefore proposed to introduce the term “keratoblast” to denote a cell in the reproductive compartment of these tissues, and thus to distinguish dividing cells from those that produce keratin."

https://openalex.org/W1993077162,"EXTRACTS of honeybee (Apis mellifera) queens inhibit the development of supplementary reproductives in the termite, Kalotermes flavicollis1. Similarly, extracts of a whole queen of the termite, Odontotermes genus2, and queen heads of O. assmuthi inhibit queen rearing by workers of A. mellifera2 and A. cerana (unpublished work of A. S. et al.) and also development of the workers' ovaries of these species. These observations indicate that the “queen substance” of honeybees and termites exhibits reciprocal activity, and suggest that the chemical nature of the queen substance of termites may be 9-oxodec-trans-2-enoic acid of A. mellifera3, A. cerana, A. dorsata4,5 and A. florea5 or a similar substance; but the queens of termites have not yet been unequivocally shown to contain queen substance. We have made extracts of physogastric queen heads of the mound-building termite, O. assmuthi, and have analysed these extracts qualitatively for queen substance."

Studies have been carried out in both male2 and female3 homosexuals; as these results are not conclusive, we have studied a group of female homosexuals with this in mind. The subjects were forty-two volunteers who were members of a lesbian organization, whose ages ranged from 22 to 55 years with a mean of 36 years."
