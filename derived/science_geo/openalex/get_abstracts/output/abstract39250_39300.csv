https://openalex.org/W2010519150,"The study of human hematopoietic cells and the human immune system is hampered by the lack of a suitable experimental model. Experimental data are presented showing that human fetal liver hematopoietic cells, human fetal thymus, and human fetal lymph node support the differentiation of mature human T cells and B cells after engraftment into mice with genetically determined severe combined immunodeficiency. The resultant SCID-hu mice are found to have a transient wave of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and human IgG (immunoglobulin G) in the peripheral circulation. The functional status of the human immune system within this mouse model is not yet known."

https://openalex.org/W1976887761,"Interleukin-1 alpha and -1 beta (IL-1α and IL-1β) are cytokines that participate in the regulation of immune responses, inflammatory reactions, and hematopoiesis. A direct expression strategy was used to clone the receptor for IL-1 from mouse T cells. The product of the cloned complementary DNA binds both IL-1α and IL-1β in a manner indistinguishable from that of the native T cell IL-1 receptor. The extracellular, IL-1 binding portion of the receptor is 319 amino acids in length and is composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains. The cytoplasmic portion of the receptor is 217 amino acids long."

https://openalex.org/W1977608747,"A cDNA encoding the human interferon-gamma receptor was isolated from a lambda gt11 expression library using a polyclonal antireceptor antiserum. The gene for this receptor was identified in a cosmid library and transfected into mouse cells. The human interferon-gamma receptor expressed in mouse cells displayed the same binding properties as in human cells. However, transfected cells were not sensitive to human IFN-gamma, suggesting the need for species-specific cofactors in receptor function. As inferred from the cDNA sequence, the human interferon-gamma receptor shows no similarities to known proteins and represents a novel transmembrane receptor. It is most likely the product of a single mRNA and a gene located on chromosome 6q."

https://openalex.org/W2019372457,"The primary human T cell response to HIV was analyzed by isolating from seronegative donors T cell clones specific for HIV gp120. T cell epitopes restricted by different MHC elements were identified within gp120, and synthetic peptides were used to address the fundamental problem of how HIV sequence variability affects T cell recognition. Even one conservative substitution can drastically reduce recognition; thus the interaction of gp120 epitopes with T cell receptors and MHC is precise and poorly crossreactive. Importantly, a subset of CD4+ gp120-specific clones manifest cytolytic activity and lyse uninfected autologous CD4+Ia+ T cells in the presence of gp120 in a process that is strictly dependent upon CD4-mediated uptake of gp120 by T cells. Assuming gp120 is shed from HIV-infected cells in vivo, this novel CD4-dependent autocytolytic mechanism may contribute to the profound depletion of CD4+ cells in AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W1534439131,"Stable transfectants of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were developed that expressed the protein encoded by a human insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor cDNA. The transfected cells expressed approximately 25,000 high affinity receptors for IGF-I (apparent Kd of 1.5 X 10(-9) M), whereas the parental CHO cells expressed only 5,000 receptors per cell (apparent Kd of 1.3 X 10(-9) M). A monoclonal antibody specific for the human IGF-I receptor inhibited IGF-I binding to the expressed receptor and immunoprecipitated polypeptides of apparent Mr values approximately 135,000 and 95,000 from metabolically labeled lysates of the transfected cells but not control cells. The expressed receptor was also capable of binding IGF-II with high affinity (Kd approximately 3 nM) and weakly recognized insulin (with about 1% the potency of IGF-I). The human IGF-I receptor expressed in these cells was capable of IGF-I-stimulated autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of endogenous substrates in the intact cell. This receptor also mediated IGF-I-stimulated glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, and DNA synthesis. The extent of these responses was comparable to the stimulation by insulin of the same biological responses in CHO cells expressing the human insulin receptor. These results indicate that the isolated cDNA encodes a functional IGF-I receptor and that there are no inherent differences in the abilities of the insulin and IGF-I receptors to mediate rapid and long term biological responses when expressed in the same cell type. The high affinity of this receptor for IGF-II also suggests that it may be important in mediating biological responses to IGF-II as well as IGF-I."
https://openalex.org/W1602370661,"We have compared the plasminogen activating capacity of one- and two-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). In a 125I-plasminogen conversion assay in the presence of high amounts of a plasmin inhibitor, one-chain u-PA pretreated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate had no detectable activity, the detection limit corresponding to the activity of a 400-fold lower amount of two-chain u-PA. In coupled assays in which generated plasmin was measured with a synthetic substrate, activity was clearly observed with the one-chain preparation, but the initial rate of plasminogen activation was lower than that of a 250-fold smaller concentration of two-chain u-PA. The coupled assays for one-chain u-PA are self-activating because plasmin catalyzes conversion of one- to two-chain u-PA, and it is not possible to decide whether the low activity of one-chain u-PA observed with this type of assay is intrinsic or due to contaminations. On the basis of these findings and a discussion of previous studies, it is concluded that one-chain u-PA has a variety of properties similar to the one-chain proenzyme forms of other serine proteases and that it should, therefore, be considered as a genuine proenzyme form of u-PA."
https://openalex.org/W1575239836,"The vacuolar membrane of Neurospora crassa contains a H+-translocating ATPase composed of at least three subunits with approximate molecular weights of 70,000, 60,000, and 15,000. Both genomic and cDNA clones encoding the largest subunit, which appears to contain the active site of the enzyme, have been isolated and sequenced. The gene for this subunit, designated vma-1, contains six small introns (60-131 base pairs) and encodes a hydrophilic protein of 607 amino acids, Mr 67,121. Within the sequence is a putative nucleotide-binding region, consistent with the proposal that this subunit contains the site of ATP hydrolysis. This 67-kDa polypeptide shows high homology (62% identical residues overall and 84% in the middle of the protein) to the analogous polypeptide of a higher plant vacuolar ATPase. The hypothesis that the vacuolar ATPase is related to F0F1 ATPases is strongly supported by the finding of considerable homology between the 67-kDa subunit of the Neurospora vacuolar ATPase and both the alpha and beta subunits of F0F1 ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W2037001735,"To investigate the possible involvement of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) gene dosage in the neuropathological symptoms of Down's syndrome, we analyzed the tongue muscle of transgenic mice that express elevated levels of human CuZnSOD. The tongue neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) in the transgenic animals exhibited significant pathological changes, namely, withdrawal and destruction of some terminal axons and the development of multiple small terminals. The ratio of terminal axon area to postsynaptic membrane decreased, and secondary folds were often complex and hyperplastic. The morphological changes in the transgenic NMJ were similar to those previously seen in muscles of aging mice and rats as well as in tongue muscle of patients with Down's syndrome. The findings suggest that CuZnSOD gene dosage is involved in the pathological abnormalities of tongue NMJ observed in Down's syndrome patients."

https://openalex.org/W2069774679,The amyloid β protein peptide is a major constituent of amyloid plaque cores in Alzheimer's disease and is apparently derived from a higher molecular weight precursor. It is now shown that the core protein of a heparan sulfate proteoglycan secreted from a nerve cell line (PC12) has an amino acid sequence and a size very similar to those of the amyloid β protein precursor and that these molecules are antigenically related. This amyloid β protein precursor-related protein is not found in the conditioned medium of a variant cell line (F3 PC12) that does not secrete heparan sulfate proteoglycan. The synaptic localization and metabolism of this class of proteoglycans are consistent with its potential involvement in central nervous system dysfunction.
https://openalex.org/W2010561234,"Mannose 6-phosphate receptors carry soluble lysosomal enzymes from the trans Golgi network (TGN) to prelysosomes, and then return to the TGN for another round of lysosomal enzyme sorting. We describe here a complementation scheme that detects the vesicular transport of the 300 kd mannose 6-phosphate/IGF-II receptor from prelysosomes to the TGN in cell extracts. In vitro transport displays the same selectivity observed in living cells in that the transferrin receptor traverses to the TGN at a much lower rate than mannose 6-phosphate receptors. Furthermore, recycling of mannose 6-phosphate/IGF-II receptors to the TGN requires GTP hydrolysis and can be distinguished biochemically from the constitutive transport of proteins between Golgi cisternae by its resistance to the weak base, primaquine."
https://openalex.org/W1567337175,"Abstract An N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase has been partially purified from Novikoff tumor cell ascites fluid by affinity chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose. The enzyme was obtained in a highly concentrated form after lyophilization. The enzyme appeared to be highly specific for acceptor oligosaccharides and glycoproteins carrying a terminal Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----R unit. Characterization of products formed by the enzyme in vitro by methylation analysis and 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed that the enzyme catalyzed the formation of a GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta-R sequence. The enzyme therefore could be described as an UDP-GlcNAc:Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta-R beta 1----3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. Acceptor specificity studies with oligosaccharides that form part of N-glycans revealed that the presence of a Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----2(Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6)Man pentasaccharide in the acceptor structure is a requirement for optimal activity. Studies on the branch specificity of the enzyme showed that the branches of this pentasaccharide structure, when contained in tri- and tetraantennary oligosaccharides, are highly preferred over other branches for attachment of the 1st and 2nd mol of GlcNAc into the acceptor molecule. The enzyme also showed activity toward oligosaccharides related to blood group I- and i-active polylactosaminoglycans. In addition the enzyme together with calf thymus UDP-Gal:GlcNAc beta-R beta 1----4-galactosyltransferase was capable of catalyzing the synthesis of a series of oligomers of N-acetyllactosamine. Competition studies revealed that all acceptors were acted upon by a single enzyme species. It is concluded that the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase functions in both the initiation and the elongation of polylactosaminoglycan chains of N-glycoproteins and possibly other glycoconjugates."
https://openalex.org/W1526957198,"C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is a multimeric protein with regulatory functions in the complement system. It also interacts with vitamin K-dependent protein S, which is involved in the regulation of the coagulation system. It has been demonstrated that C4BP consists of seven disulfide-linked, identical 70-kDa subunits, which are arranged to give the molecule a spider-like structure. We now have evidence for the presence of a new subunit in C4BP. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis it appears as a weakly stainable band with a molecular weight of approximately 45,000. The subunit was isolated by gel filtration in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride of reduced and carboxymethylated C4BP. Its amino-terminal sequence is distinct from previously known protein sequences. The stoichiometry of 45- to 70-kDa subunits was estimated to be 1:9, indicating the presence of one 45-kDa subunit per C4BP molecule. The new subunit was demonstrated to be a disulfide-linked component of the central core of C4BP. It was sensitive to proteolysis by chymotrypsin, and when cleaved the protein S binding ability of C4BP was lost. With protein S bound to C4BP, the 45-kDa subunit was protected from degradation by chymotrypsin, and the protein S binding site remained intact. These data suggest that the new subunit is directly involved in protein S binding."
https://openalex.org/W2063527046,"Run-on transcription experiments were used to demonstrate that transcription of T cell receptor β chain V genes is activated by DNA rearrangement, in a manner similar to immunoglobulin genes. A transcriptional enhancer likely to be involved in this activation has been identified. A 25-kilobase region from J β1 to V β14 was tested for enhancer activity by transient transfections, and an enhancer was found 7.5 kilobases 3′ of C β2 . The β enhancer has low activity relative to the simian virus 40 viral enhancer, does not display a preference for V β promoters, has a T cell-specific activity, and binds two purified immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer factors."
https://openalex.org/W1512818335,"Because the interaction of denatured hemoglobins (i.e. hemichromes) with the red cell membrane has been associated with several abnormalities commonly observed in hemichrome-containing erythrocytes, we have undertaken to isolate and characterize the hemichrome-rich membrane protein aggregates from sickle cells. The aggregates were isolated by two procedures: one at low ionic strength by centrifugation of detergent-solubilized spectrin-depleted inside-out vesicles, and the other at physiological ionic strength by detergent solubilization of whole cells followed by cytoskeletal disruption and centrifugation. The extensively washed aggregates obtained by both methods yielded similar results. These insoluble complexes were found to be highly cross-linked by predominantly intermolecular disulfide bonds; however, other nonreducible covalent linkages were also observed. Both in the presence and absence of reducing agents, the aggregate disintegrated when the hemichromes were removed by high ionic strength, suggesting that the aggregate depended heavily on the cohesive properties of the hemichromes for stability. Protein assays demonstrated that the aggregates comprised approximately 1.3% of the total membrane protein, roughly two-thirds of which appeared to be globin chains. Other major components identified in the aggregate were band 3, ankyrin, bands 4.1, 4.9, and 5, glycophorins A and B, and autologous IgG. Quantitative analysis of the IgG content demonstrated that three-fourths of the surface-bound IgG on washed sickle cells was clustered at these aggregate sites, representing an enrichment of approximately 250-fold over nonaggregated regions of the membrane. Since clustered cell surface IgG is thought to trigger removal of erythrocytes from circulation, the hemichrome-induced membrane reorganization at these aggregate sites may be an important cause of the greatly shortened life span of sickle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1577973593,"We have examined the associations of purified red cell band 4.2 with red cell membrane and membrane skeletal proteins using in vitro binding assays. Band 4.2 bound to the purified cytoplasmic domain of band 3 with a Kd between 2 and 8 X 10(-7) M. Binding was saturable and slow, requiring 2-4 h to reach equilibrium. This finding confirms previous work suggesting that the principal membrane-binding site for band 4.2 lies within the 43-kDa cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (Korsgren, C., and Cohen, C. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5536-5543). Band 4.2 also bound to purified ankyrin in solution with a Kd between 1 and 3.5 X 10(-7) M. As with the cytoplasmic domain of band 3, binding was saturable and required 4-5 h to reach equilibrium. Reconstitution with ankyrin of inside-out vesicles stripped of all peripheral proteins had no effect upon band 4.2 binding to membranes; similarly, reconstitution with band 4.2 had no effect upon ankyrin binding. This shows that ankyrin and band 4.2 bind to distinct loci within the 43-kDa band 3 cytoplasmic domain. Coincubation of ankyrin and band 4.2 in solution partially blocked the binding of both proteins to the membrane. Similarly, coincubation of bands 4.1 and 4.2 in solution partially blocked binding of both to membranes. In all cases, the data suggest the possibility that domains on each of these proteins responsible for low affinity membrane binding are principally affected. The data also provide evidence for an association of band 4.2 with band 4.1. Our results show that band 4.2 can form multiple associations with red cell membrane proteins and may therefore play an as yet unrecognized structural role on the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1586975738,"To localize and characterize the nucleotide site of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, we have investigated the effects of ADP, ATP, and analogues of these nucleotides on the rate of dephosphorylation of both native ATPase and ATPase modified with fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate (FITC), a reagent which hinders access of nucleotides to the ATPase catalytic site without affecting phosphorylation from Pi. Dephosphorylation of the phosphoenzyme formed from Pi was monitored by rapid filtration or stopped-flow fluorescence, mostly at 20 degrees C, pH 6.0, and in the absence of potassium. Fluorescence measurements were made possible through the use of 8-bromo-ATP, which selectively quenched certain tryptophan residues of the ATPase, thereby allowing the intrinsic fluorescence changes associated with dephosphorylation to be measured in the presence of bound nucleotide. ATP, 8-bromo-ATP, and trinitrophenyladenosine diand triphosphate, but not ADP, enhanced the rate of dephosphorylation of native ATPase 2-3-fold when added in the absence of divalent cations. Millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ eliminated the accelerating effects. Acceleration in the absence of Mg2+ was observed at relatively low concentrations of ATP and 8-bromo-ATP (0.01-0.1 mM) and binding of metal-free ATP and ADP, but not Mg.ATP, to the phosphoenzyme in this concentration range was demonstrated directly. Modification of the ATPase with FITC blocked nucleotide binding in the submillimolar concentration range and eliminated the nucleotide-induced acceleration of dephosphorylation. These results show that dephosphorylation, under these conditions, is regulated by ATP but not by Mg.ATP or ADP, and that the catalytic site is the locus of this regulatory ATP binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1571194932,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which distinguish Type 3 protein kinase C (PKC) from Types 1 and 2 have been obtained from mice immunized with purified Type 3 PKC from rabbit brain cytosol. Most of these mAbs (seven out of eight) selectively recognize Type 3 versus Types 1 and 2 PKC in both enzyme-linked immunosorbent and immunoblot assays. Trypsin treatment of Type 3 PKC reduced the immunoreactivity with 82-kDa PKC and generated immunoreactive fragments of 45 and 35 kDa. The mAbs can be divided into two classes based on their ability to recognize the 45-kDa catalytic fragment (5/8) or the 35 kDa regulatory domain fragment (3/8). Each of the mAbs inhibits phosphorylation of histone or lipocortin by PKC, although the extent of the inhibition varied. Only those mAbs that recognize the 35-kDa regulatory domain inhibited phorbol ester binding. The inhibition of both kinase and binding activities by this group of mAbs was sensitive to the concentration of phospholipid used in the assay. This functional inhibition suggests that these mAbs may be useful for defining the phospholipid binding domain(s) of Type 3 PKC. The mAbs recognized 82-kDa PKC in a variety of cell types; the presence of smaller molecular weight fragments was not consistently found. Distinct immunofluorescence staining patterns were observed with mAbs directed toward different epitopes, suggesting that there may be heterogeneity in the subcellular localization of PKC. The type specificity of these mAbs will make them valuable tools for studying activation and regulation of Type 3 PKC in cell culture model systems."
https://openalex.org/W1503320375,"Rat 1 fibroblasts have been transfected with the cDNA encoding a kinase-defective mutant human insulin receptor (A/K1018). Expression of this cDNA results in a receptor that is not only biologically inactive but also inhibits normal insulin action through the normal endogenous rat receptors in this fibroblast line (McClain, D. A., Maegawa, H., Lee, J., Dull, T. J., Ullrich, A., and Olefsky, J. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14663-14671). We have investigated the mechanism of this inhibition and show that: 1) rat receptors are expressed at normal to increased levels in two cell lines which also express A/K1018 receptors at low (A/K1018-A, 5700 total receptors) or high (A/K1018-B, 2.2 x 10(5) total receptors) levels. 2) The rat receptors in the A/K1018 lines can be normally autophosphorylated under the control of insulin in vitro. 3) A/K1018 receptors do not inhibit the kinase activity of normal receptors when mixed together in vitro. 4) In intact A/K1018-B cells, the ability of insulin to stimulate autophosphorylation of the rat receptor is unimpaired; furthermore, the autophosphorylated rat receptor becomes normally activated as a tyrosine kinase. 5) The expression of receptors for insulin-like growth factor I and stimulation of hexose uptake mediated by this receptor are unaffected in cells expressing inhibitory A/K1018 receptors. 6) Expression of the A/K1018 receptor inhibits insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of two endogenous protein substrates (pp220 and pp170) by the native rat receptors. We conclude that the inhibition of insulin action seen in the A/K1018 cells is not mediated at the levels of native receptor expression or activation, nor is the effector (hexose uptake) mechanism affected by the A/K1018 receptors. The expression of this kinase-defective receptor does, however, inhibit the phosphorylation of substrate molecules by the normally activated endogenous rat receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1527988096,"Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is stored in mammalian atria primarily as ANF-(1-126), the precursor to the known circulating form of the hormone ANF-(99-126). When primary cultures of atrial myocytes were maintained in a complete serum-free medium, they contained and secreted an ANF-(1-126)-like peptide. The addition of dexamethasone to the culture medium, however, resulted in the secretion of a molecule with chromatographic characteristics identical to ANF-(99-126), although the intracellular storage form of ANF was unchanged. Radiosequencing and amino acid analysis confirmed that the cultures maintained in dexamethasone secreted authentic ANF-(99-126). Chronic exposure of the cells to dexamethasone also resulted in a significant increase in the quantity of immunoreactive ANF both contained and secreted by the cultures. Dexamethasone stimulated ANF processing and secretion by atrial cultures in a dose-dependent manner, with an approximate EC50 of 10 nM. This stimulation could be reversed by removing the glucocorticoid from the culture medium. ANF processing was also stimulated by the specific glucocorticoid receptor agonist RU 28362, and both DEX- and RU 28362-stimulated ANF processing was inhibited by the specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 38486. Ventricular cells, which possess few granules and release ANF in a constitutive fashion, were also capable of processing ANF in a glucocorticoid-dependent fashion. Medium freshly removed from atrial cultures did not convert ANF-(1-126) to ANF-(99-126) nor was exogenous ANF-(1-126) efficiently processed when added to the medium of actively processing cultures. These results indicate that the post-translational processing of ANF-(1-126) to ANF-(99-126) likely occurs within or in close association with the cardiac myocytes and is not dependent on the presence of large quantities of secretory granules. Furthermore, it is apparent that both the expression and the post-translational processing of ANF by cultured cardiac myocytes is specifically regulated by glucocorticoids."
https://openalex.org/W2010740840,"Human T lymphocytes, metabolically labeled with 35S-cysteine and 35S-methionine, were reacted with the homobifunctional cross-linking reagent, dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) (DSP). When detergent lysates from these cells were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody reactive with the CD8 antigen, a radiolabeled protein of approximately 44 kd was coprecipitated with the CD8 molecule. Immunoprecipitates from detergent lysates prepared without prior chemical cross-linking contained only the 33 kd CD8 molecule. Similar results were obtained when T lymphocytes or a cytotoxic T cell clone (T4T8Cl) were radiolabeled with 32P-orthophosphoric acid. The 44 kd CD8-associated protein was identified as the heavy chain of the class I major histocompatibility antigen by depletion in preclearing experiments with anti-class I MHC antibody and by peptide mapping. Further analyses indicated that the CD8-class I MHC association is due, in part at least, to disulfide bonding, which may be susceptible to cleavage during processing of cell lysates."
https://openalex.org/W1999310751,"The rearrangement of T cell antigen receptor beta- and gamma-chain gene segments was studied in transgenic mice that bear a functional beta-chain gene. Virtually all CD3-positive T cells derived from transgenic mice express beta chains containing the transgene-encoded V beta 8.2 variable region on their surfaces and do not express endogenous beta-chain variable regions. Expression of endogenous V beta genes is inhibited at the level of somatic recombination during thymic ontogeny. Furthermore, rearrangements of the TCR gamma-chain genes are also markedly inhibited in these transgenic animals. Hence expression of the TCR beta transgene has led to allelic exclusion of alpha beta receptors and isotypic exclusion of gamma delta T cell receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2071001795,"Oligonucleotides complementary to regions of U1 and U2 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), when injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, rapidly induced the specific degradation of U1 and U2 snRNAs, respectively, and then themselves were degraded. After such treatment, splicing of simian virus 40 (SV40) late pre-mRNA transcribed from microinjected viral DNA was blocked in oocytes. If before introduction of SV40 DNA into oocytes HeLa cell U1 or U2 snRNAs were injected and allowed to assemble into small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP)-like complexes, SV40 late RNA was as efficiently spliced as in oocytes that did not receive U1 or U2 oligonucleotides. This demonstrates that oocytes can form fully functional hybrid U1 and U2 snRNPs consisting of human snRNA and amphibian proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2065472386,"In the terminus-generating (ter) reaction of phage lambda, the phage enzyme terminase catalyzes the production of staggered nicks within the cohesive-end nicking site (cosN). Although the two nicks are related by a rotational symmetry axis that bisects cosN, the in vitro ter reaction is strikingly asymmetric at the nucleotide level. Nicking of the lambda r strand precedes nicking of the I strand. Furthermore, when the two nicking reactions are uncoupled, they have different nucleotide cofactor requirements. ATP plays critical roles during cos cleavage: First, nicking of both DNA strands is stimulated by the addition of ATP. Second, ATP is required for the correct specificity of r-strand nicking since, in the absence of nucleotide, the r-strand nick is shifted 8 bases to the left. Studies with nonhydrolyzable analogs indicate that ATP hydrolysis is not required for these functions. However, after the two nicks are made, terminase catalyzes a disengagement of the cohered ends in a reaction that requires ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1544715548,"The biosynthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker has been studied in transport-impaired mouse lymphoma cells to determine the subcellular location of the processing enzymes and to characterize the biosynthetic intermediates. Cells were labeled with [2-3H]mannose and chased at a low temperature (15 or 20 degrees C) or at 37 degrees C in the presence of m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone to disrupt transport of the pulse-labeled molecules within the secretory apparatus. Both treatments inhibited the migration of the pulse-labeled glycoproteins to the Golgi apparatus as measured by the production of complex-type asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. Despite this inhibition in protein transport, acid hydrolases were phosphorylated. Structural analysis of the phosphorylated oligosaccharides indicated that the transport-impaired cells produced a single species of phosphorylated high mannose oligosaccharide; essentially all of the molecules contain a single phosphodiester group that is restricted to the alpha 1,6 branch of the oligosaccharide. The results suggest that synthesis of mannose 6-phosphate-bearing high mannose oligosaccharides occurs in an ordered, compartmentalized posttranslational process. The initial phosphorylation of newly synthesized acid hydrolases occurs at a pre-Golgi site and results in the production of high mannose-type units that contain a single phosphodiester group. In a subsequent compartment, probably within the Golgi apparatus, the monophosphorylated units may be converted to diphosphorylated forms. Finally, at a site distal to the phosphorylation reactions the diesters are hydrolyzed to reveal the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker."
https://openalex.org/W1985014078,"Recently, covalently bound fatty acids have been identified on a variety of proteins. Many of these acyl proteins are physiologically important, and the lipid modification often appears to be essential for their function. In this investigation mature erythrocytes have been used to study in detail the metabolic behavior of protein-bound fatty acids. Although deficient in protein synthesis, these cells are still able to covalently attach [3H]palmitic acid to proteins located at the plasma membrane and its associated cytoskeleton. Linkage analyses demonstrated that the labeled polypeptides contained ester- or thioester-bound fatty acids. The covalent binding of fatty acid was rapidly reversible. Half-lives of the protein-bound fatty acid molecules ranged from less than 30 min to more than 3 h. The deacylation reaction was not due to a chemically labile linkage of protein and fatty acid but appeared to be physiologically induced. Differences in the fatty acid turnover rates between the acyl proteins suggested an independent regulation of their lipid turnover. A number of proteins underwent dynamic fatty acid acylation, indicating that palmitylated proteins undergoing fatty acid turnover are not a rare exception."
https://openalex.org/W2072718172,"According to our present understanding, lambda repressor bound to DNA stimulates transcription by touching RNA polymerase bound at an adjacent promoter. The part of repressor required for activation was identified in part by the isolation of mutants specifically impaired in transcriptional activation. The amino acids of repressor altered in these ""positive control"" mutants lie in an acidic patch on the surface of repressor that is closely apposed to RNA polymerase. In this study, we show that this ""activating patch"" of repressor is sufficient for transcriptional activation in another sequence context. We transfer this activating patch onto the surface of lambda Cro, a protein normally unable to activate transcription, and show that the modified Cro is a transcriptional activator. In addition, we provide evidence that the repressor protein of phage 434 also activates transcription using an activating patch similar to that of lambda repressor."
https://openalex.org/W236589353,"Factor H, a very important regulator of alternative pathway activation, exerts its effects by binding to the third component complement, C3. In this study we present evidence that factor H reacts with at least two sites in the third component of complement (C3), and we have mapped one of these sites within the C3d fragment of C3. By using direct binding assays of an anti-human H anti-idiotypic antibody (alpha alpha H) and of H to C3 fragments, it was shown that both bound to the C3b and C3d (but not to C3c) fragments of C3. Cleavage of C3d by CNBr generated two major fragments with Mr values of 12,500 (residues 997-1107) and 8,600 (residues 1178-1252). Binding studies with these two fragments showed that only the Mr 8,600 fragment bound to both H and alpha alpha H. Several synthetic peptides (A58, 1192-1249; P28, 1187-1214; P16, 1194-1209; P14, 1201-1214; B17, 1206-1222; J28, 1222-1249; and J16, 1234-1249) were synthesized according to the primary sequence of the Mr 8,600 fragment. Based on the differential binding of these synthetic peptides to H, their inhibitory effect on H binding to C3b or C3d, and their effect on H cofactor activity, we mapped the H binding site in C3 to a discontinuous site spanning residues 1187-1249 of the C3 sequence. By studying the inhibition of H binding to C3b or C3d by the different synthetic peptides, we also present evidence that a second binding site in C3b for H exists."
https://openalex.org/W1550781130,"Our studies have revealed that the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors and response in BALB/c/3T3 fibroblasts are modulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Incubation of quiescent cultures of BALB/c/3T3 fibroblasts with PDGF resulted in 4-5 fold higher 125I-IL-1 binding than the untreated cultures. Scatchard analysis showed that the increased 125I-IL-1 binding by PDGF-treated cells was due to a net increase in cell surface IL-1 receptors with no apparent change in binding affinity. The PDGF-induced increase of 125I-IL-1 binding was blocked by inhibitors of transcription, suggesting that a transcriptional event, perhaps a de novo synthesis of IL-1 receptors, is required for PDGF response. In a culture medium depleted of serum factors, IL-1 alone produced only a marginal (40-50%) increase in DNA synthesis in BALB/c/3T3 cells. In cells first exposed to PDGF, IL-1 produced 8-10-fold higher DNA synthesis than the controls. These findings provide evidence that IL-1 action in fibroblast may be regulated at the level of receptor expression."
https://openalex.org/W1593167918,"Abstract Functional receptors (IL1-R) for the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 (IL1) were solubilized from plasma membranes of the NOB-1 subclone of murine EL4 6.1 thymoma cells using the zwitterionic detergent 3[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS). Membrane extracts were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and ligand blotted with 125I-labeled recombinant human IL1 alpha in order to reveal proteins capable of specifically binding IL1. A single polydisperse polypeptide of Mr approximately equal to 80,000 was identified in this way, which bound IL1 alpha and IL1 beta with the same affinity as the IL1-R on intact NOB-1 cells (approximately equal to 10(-10) M). The IL1-binding polypeptide was only seen in membranes from IL1-R-bearing cells and did not react with interleukin 2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or interferon. IL1-R was purified to apparent homogeneity from solubilized NOB-1 membranes by affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose and IL1 alpha-Sepharose. Gel electrophoresis and silver staining of purified preparations revealed a single protein of Mr approximately equal to 80,000 which reacted positively in the ligand-blotting procedure and which we identify as the ligand-binding moiety of the murine IL1-R. Purified IL1-R exhibited the same affinity and specificity as the receptor on intact cells. The relationship of this protein to proteins identified by covalent cross-linking studies is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1513529809,"The synthesis and dimerization of beta-chains during the formation of catalytically active beta-hexosaminidase B were studied in a cell-free system. beta-chain mRNA, transcribed from the cloned cDNA with SP6 polymerase, was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte protein-synthesizing system in the presence of dog pancreas microsomal membranes and oxidized glutathione. Under these conditions, the primary beta-chain translation product was translocated into the microsomal vesicles and modified by the addition of N-linked oligosaccharide chains. After transfer into the microsomal vesicles, the beta-polypeptide assumed a conformation resembling the native state as determined by antibody reactivity. Like the authentic precursor enzyme, the microsomally located chains were assembled into dimers and were catalytically active. In intact human fibroblasts, dimerization of beta-chains occurred within 15 min after their synthesis, consistent with a site of assembly in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The cell-free expression system was also useful in establishing the functionality of beta-chain initiator methionine codons. By expression of beta-chain mRNAs with altered methionine codons, we demonstrated that polypeptides initiating from any of the first three methionine codons in the beta-chain sequence contain a functional signal sequence and form catalytically active enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1638131725,"Abstract Congenitally abnormal fibrinogen Kyoto I with impaired fibrin monomer polymerization contains a normal gamma-chain and a gamma-chain variant (gamma Kyoto I) that has an apparently lower Mr on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the Laemmli system (Laemmli, U. K. (1970) Nature 227, 680-685) but migrates with apparently normal Mr in the Weber and Osborn system (Weber, K., and Osborn, M. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 4406-4412). Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatographic analyses of the cyanogen bromide or lysyl endopeptidase cleavage fragments of the purified gamma-chains of fibrinogen Kyoto I showed the presence of peptides not seen from normal fibrinogen. Amino acid sequence analysis of these peptides indicated that gamma Asn308 of the gamma-chain variant is replaced by lysine. Purified fragment D1 of fibrinogen Kyoto I also contains two types of D1 gamma-remnants: normal and apparently lower Mr types. Abnormal fragment D1 is cleaved faster to fragments D2 and D3 by plasmin in the presence of [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) than normal fragment D1, as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting using anti-gamma-chain monoclonal antibody. Analysis of peptides released from fragment D1 by plasmin in the presence of EGTA demonstrated the cleavage of the gamma Lys308-Gly309 bond. Fragment D1 of fibrinogen Kyoto I has normal calcium binding properties. The data suggest that a region or conformation containing gamma Asn308 affects the polymerization of fibrin monomers and that the gamma Asn308----Lys replacement causes a conformational change in the gamma-chain which results in the accelerated cleavage of gamma Lys356-Ala357 and gamma Lys302-Phe303 bonds by plasmin and also results in the generation of a new plasmin cleavage site between Lys308 and Gly309 in the presence of EGTA. During these studies, we found that part of the gamma Lys212-Glu213 bond in fragment D1 is cleaved by plasmin in the presence of EGTA."
https://openalex.org/W2052815357,"Most T lymphocytes express an antigen-specific receptor composed of two subunits, alpha and beta, each of which can exhibit structural variability. A complex selection process operates on T cells during development in the thymus such that cells expressing only particular alpha beta-receptors migrate to the periphery. The alpha-chain repertoire was dissected at different stages of the selection process by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to amplify only those transcripts of a particular variable region gene (V58). Sequences from these V58 cDNAs reveal the predominant expression of four joining (J) segments by T cells in the adult thymus, suggesting that molecular or cellular processes select particular V alpha J alpha combinations during development. T cells expressing one of these V58J alpha chains appear to have been negatively selected at a later stage, since these transcripts were present in the spleen at approximately one-tenth the level in the thymus. Results also indicate that residues present at the V alpha J alpha junction may be important in an early selection process."

The binding properties and apparent molecular weight of the murine interferon gamma receptor protein synthesized in frog oocytes is similar to that found on mouse cells. This is the first report of a functional receptor for a polypeptide ligand (interferon gamma) expressed in and directly assayed on frog oocytes.
https://openalex.org/W1521252930,"Insulin is known to increase the number of cell surface insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) receptors in isolated rat adipose cells through a subcellular redistribution mechanism similar to that for the glucose transporter. The effects of insulin on these two processes, therefore, have now been directly compared in the same cell preparations. 1) Insulin increases the steady state number of cell surface IGF-II receptors by 7-13-fold without affecting receptor affinity; however, insulin stimulates glucose transport activity by 25-40-fold. 2) The insulin concentration required for half-maximal stimulation of cell surface IGF-II receptor number is approximately 30% lower than that for the stimulation of glucose transport activity. 3) The half-time for the achievement of insulin's maximal effect at 37 degrees C is much shorter for IGF-II receptor number (approximately 0.8 min) than for glucose transport activity (approximately 2.6 min). 4) Reversal of insulin's action at 37 degrees C occurs more rapidly for cell surface IGF-II receptors (t1/2 congruent to 2.9 min) than for glucose transport activity (t1/2 congruent to 4.9 min). 5) When the relative subcellular distribution of IGF-II receptors is examined in basal cells, less than 10% of the receptors are localized to the plasma membrane fraction indicating that most of the receptors, like glucose transporters, are localized to an intracellular compartment. However, in response to insulin, the number of plasma membrane IGF-II receptors increases only approximately 1.4-fold while the number of glucose transporters increases approximately 4.5-fold. Thus, while the stimulatory actions of insulin on cell surface IGF-II receptors and glucose transport activity are qualitatively similar, marked quantitative differences suggest that the subcellular cycling of these two integral membrane proteins occurs by distinct processes."
https://openalex.org/W1563946901,"We have investigated the expression of the 35- and 67-kDa calcimedins and calmodulin during fetal and neonatal periods and in adulthood in rat liver, muscle, and brain. The 35- and 67-kDa calcimedin expression in liver and muscle increased during the perinatal period and correlated with the thyroid status of the developing rat. In fact, animals treated with thyroxine demonstrated a precocious appearance of the 35- and 67-kDa calcimedin in liver and muscle. Animals treated with methylthiouracil, an inhibitor of T4 and T3 synthesis, strongly suppressed the synthesis of the calcimedins in these tissues. Neither treatment influenced the levels of either the 35- and 67-kDa calcimedins in brain. In contrast, each tissue examined produced a unique pattern of calmodulin expression during development. None of the tissue calmodulin concentrations changed during hyper- or hypothyroid states. Collectively, these data support the concept that the intracellular calcium signal possesses multiple, independent molecular pathways of mediation. In addition, the variety of these pathways is influenced by hormonal preconditioning in that the cellular response to elevated cytosolic calcium is dependent upon the thyroid status of a tissue."
https://openalex.org/W161876527,"The exposure of WRK1 cells to arginine vasopressin (AVP), lysine vasopressin, or oxytocin for 18 h at 37 degrees C induced a homologous desensitization of the vasopressin- (VP) receptors. Dose-response curves of [3H]lysine vasopressin binding to control and desensitized WRK1 cells revealed a decrease in the maximal number of binding sites without any modification of its affinity (Kd values = 4.40 +/- 0.76 nM and 4.65 +/- 0.78 nM for control and desensitized conditions, respectively). The phenomenon was time- and dose-dependent. It was directly related to receptor occupancy, since the concentration of VP analogues leading to a half-maximal occupancy of VP receptors was closely related to the concentration of the corresponding analogue leading to a half-maximal decrease in VP-binding sites. It was also agonist-specific, since the V1 vasopressin antagonist desGly9d(CH2)5[D-Tyr(Et)2]VAVP was unable to affect the number of receptors. These desensitization processes were completely inhibited when the functional coated pits present in WRK1 cells were suppressed, indicating that the loss of VP-binding sites was related to receptor internalization. The exposure of WRK1 cells to a vasopressin agonist for 18 h also led to an inhibition of the vasopressin-sensitive phospholipase C activity. It was time- and agonist-dose-dependent, and occurred without any detectable changes in apparent affinity values (1.40 +/- 0.04 and 1.90 +/- 0.36 nM for control and desensitized cells, respectively). Control experiments showed that these inhibitions could not have been caused by a decrease in the labeling of inositol lipids. It is likely that they were mainly due to receptor internalization since (i) the hormonal treatment did not modify the basal level of phospholipase C; (ii) the maximal loss of VP-binding site was similar to the maximal inhibition of VP-stimulated IP accumulation; (iii) the recoveries of both VP-binding sites and VP-sensitive phospholipase C activity followed exactly the same time course (t1/2 = 4 h). In addition to this homologous desensitization of VP-sensitive phospholipase C activity, AVP also induced heterologous desensitization of bradykinin-sensitive phospholipase C activity. However, this effect was relatively weak (maximal inhibition 17 +/- 3%). The time course of VP-sensitive phospholipase C desensitization was more rapid than that of VP-receptors, indicating that desensitization involved at least two distinct steps, a rapid uncoupling step, and a later loss of vasopressin receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1559614071,"Purine nucleotide pools in the fungus Neurospora crassa decline in response to carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur deprivation. There is, in addition, a decline in GTP/ATP ratios on nitrogen or sulfur deprivation in wild type. The GTP/ATP decline is missing on nitrogen deprivation of the nitrogen control mutant, nit-2, and on sulfur deprivation of the sulfur control mutant, cys-3. The nit-2 mutant also shows elevated UTP pools on nitrogen deprivation when compared with similarly treated wild type. Six-hour sulfur-deprived cys-3 shows multiple aberrations in nucleotide pools when compared with similarly treated wild type. These include very low energy charge and depletion of pools of most nucleotides. ATP in sulfur-deprived cys-3 drops by about 88%. Sulfur-deprived cys-3 is also greatly impaired in comparison with wild type in its ability to resume growth when restored to nutritional sufficiency after a period of sulfur deprivation. These results clearly demonstrate that the nitrogen (nit-2) and sulfur (cys-3 regulatory systems are not limited to control of catabolism of exogenous nitrogen and sulfur sources, respectively, but rather influence, a broader range of cellular properties than has been previously thought. The pattern of GTP pool control is consistent with a positive role for GTP in growth control. Evidence in other systems supporting such a growth-regulating role for GTP is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1583038343,"The effect of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on angiotensin II- and histamine-induced contraction and muscle light chain phosphorylation was examined in strips of rabbit aorta smooth muscle. Preincubation of strips with 10(-7) M ANP prior to addition of either agonist inhibits both the increase in extent of myosin light chain phosphorylation and the contractile response to either 5 x 10(-8) M angiotensin II or 10(-5) M histamine without inhibiting the agonist-induced increase in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration. Furthermore, in muscle strips precontracted with either angiotensin II or histamine, addition of ANP leads to a prompt relaxation and a prompt decrease in the extent of myosin light chain phosphorylation. These data argue that ANP uncouples the initial agonist-induced Ca2+ transient from the increase in extent of myosin light chain phosphorylation either by inhibiting the Ca2+-dependent activation of myosin light chain kinase or stimulating the activity of a phosphoprotein phosphatase capable of bringing about the rapid dephosphorylation of phosphorylated myosin light chains."

https://openalex.org/W1571213844,"Abstract We have investigated the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the Ca2+-ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum under conditions that result in a single transport cycle. Simultaneous addition of ATP and EGTA to sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, preincubated with calcium, resulted in a transient of intermediate species. In the presence of saturating Ca2+ levels, total E-P species reached a maximum of 2.3 nmol/mg at 100 ms, followed by a monoexponential decay with kobs = 3.6 s-1. The data are interpreted in terms of Ca2+ sequestration, either by occlusion as Ca2+ in the phosphorylated enzyme or chelation by EGTA. Maximum Ca2+ uptake was 8.3 nmol/mg with the release of 4.4 nmol/mg Pi. The ratio of Ca2+ uptake to Pi release approached 1.9 over a wide [Ca2+] range. Equilibrium Ca2+ binding, in the absence of ATP, showed a K0.5 of 0.88 microM with a Hill coefficient of 1.9. The Ca2+ concentration dependence of Ca2+ uptake during single-cycle catalysis showed a 10-fold enhanced affinity (K0.5 = 0.06 microM) and was noncooperative (nH = 0.9). Quench with excess EGTA (greater than 2 mM) decreased Ca2+ uptake to 1 nmol/mg, indicating an off rate of Ca2+ from high affinity sites that exceeds 100 s-1. The ATP concentration dependence for a single-cycle catalysis showed an apparent K0.5 of 1.1 microM, similar to that for ATP equilibrium binding. It is proposed that enzyme phosphorylation proceeds only following binding of a second calcium ion to externally oriented sites whose intrinsic affinity is in the same range as the calcium dependence of a single-cycle turnover."
