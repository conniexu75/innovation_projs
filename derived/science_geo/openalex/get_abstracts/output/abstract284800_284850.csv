https://openalex.org/W1987570618,"In the femoral marrow of three adult marmosets, two male Callithrix jacchus and one female Leontocebus rosalia, a number of opposite-sexed metaphases were found. It is inferred that this chimeric state resulted from intrauterine placental anastomoses between heterosexual twins. The lack of the freemartin effect in connection with this chimerism is discussed, and the structural nature of the Y chromosome in the Callithricidae is described."

https://openalex.org/W2060072667,The millipede Pachydesmus crassicutis (Wood) secretes a mixture of benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide when it is disturbed. These compounds are secreted through paired glands located on 11 of the notal projections of adult millipedes. Experiments with the imported fire ant demonstrate that these natural products serve a defensive function.

It is suggested that these systematic variations in force level may provide, through feedback, discriminable cues for behavioral regulation."

When soil suction was below 0.6 bar, the impedance was largely in the plant. When suction was greater than 1 or 2 bars, the soil became the limiting factor. Water movement to the plant roots takes place primarily in the liquid phase."

They are glutamic acid, lysine, glycine, aspartic acid, serine, alanine, leucine, valine plus cystine, isoleucine, ornithine, methionine sulfoxide, threonine, tyrosine and phenylalanine, histidine, arginine, proline, and methionine. The results indicate that the dissolved organic material in deep-sea water may make an important contribution to the organic budget of the sea."
https://openalex.org/W1990491856,"Infrared spectra of the four-coordinated quartz and coesite polymorphs of SiO(2), the rutile six-coordinated (stishovite) polymorph of SiO(2), and the quartz and rutile polymorphs of GeO(2) show that a change from tetrahedral to octahedral cation coordination results in (i) a 23-per-cent increase in the wavelength of the main absorption band for both the SiO(2) and GeO(2) polymorphs and (ii) a significant increase in the force constant of the same magnitude for the SiO(2) and GeO(2) polymorphs. The quartz and the rutile isostructural pairs for SiO(2) and GeO(2) show that the effect of increasing mass is to increase proportionally the wavelength of the respective main absorption bands. The infrared data for the rutile form of SiO(2) fit the empirical equation of Dachille and Roy relating cation coordination, mass, atomic number, valence, and main absorption wavelength."
https://openalex.org/W2005105491,The minimum amount of water necessary to sustain human life is calculated. The water needed to produce a pound of meat is 25 times the amount needed to produce a pound of vegetables or grain. The amount of water now being used to sustain the American standard of living is computed. The number of people the American land could feed if all the rainfall in the country were totally utilized is calculated. It is estimated that the country could accomodate 50 million more people bringing the total population to 230 million before there would be any decrease in the present standard of living. This figure will have been reached by the year 2000.

https://openalex.org/W2035086277,"Unfertilized Arbacia eggs have five electrophoretically distinct malic dehydrogenases which differ in their rates with pyridine nucleotide analogs. Both the number of peaks and their relative size change during early embryonic development. A D-malic dehydrogenase which utilizes the 3-acetylpyridine analog of DPN but not DPN itself was found. Electrophoresis on starch gel results in five peaks, all of which differ from the peaks of the L-malic dehydrogenases."

https://openalex.org/W2069373577,"A pollen diagram from Kirchner Marsh, southeastern Minnesota, records a continuous vegetation sequence from the time of Late Wisconsin ice retreat from the region. The late-glacial and early postglacial portions of the diagram are correlated with a radiocarbon-dated diagram from Madelia, Minnesota. Both diagrams show a series of maxima of pollen types in the early postglacial that suggest a significant climatic change at that time. The Kirchner diagram, in addition, shows high percentages of nonarboreal pollen later in the postglacial that indicate an advance of prairie elements into the area between 7200 and 5000 years ago."

https://openalex.org/W2086860773,"Radioanalyses by gamma-ray spectrometry have been carried out on 37 samples of Euphausia pacifica obtained from a network of stations off the Oregon coast. Data on euphausiids taken from this area in November 1961 and in March and April 1962 are compared to show the variation in concentration of zirconium-95 and niobium-95, ruthenium-103, and cerium-141, with time and location. A mixture of zirconium-95 and niobium-95 was the most abundant fission product noted."

https://openalex.org/W2068620446,"The primary reason for measuring thermal radiation from nuclear weapons is to evaluate the hazards associated with the heating of exposed objects. These hazards include cutaneous burns in humans, flash blindness, retinal burns, heating and subsequent weakening of wings and cortrol surfaces of aircraft, and the ignition of kindling fuels such as those that helped produce the great fire at Hiroshima. Studies on these effects call for detailed information on the thermal radiation, including its spectral distribution, the irradiance history and the total energy as a function of distance, weather, and other factors. Rough scaling laws, that relate the diameter and power temperature of the fireball with the time and yield, make it possible to predict thermal radiation damage for a wide variety of conditions. These laws are based on data accumulated from weapons tests during the period between 1948 and 1958. Data are presented graphically on the luminous efficiency of a nuclear fireball in air with a comparison with other familiar light sources. Comparison is also made between the light from a fireball and light from the stars and from the sun. (C.H.)"
