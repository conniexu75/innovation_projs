https://openalex.org/W2611346822,"To better understand transcriptional regulation during human oogenesis and preimplantation development, we defined stage-specific transcription, which highlighted the cleavage stage as being highly distinctive. Here, we present multiple lines of evidence that a eutherian-specific multicopy retrogene, DUX4, encodes a transcription factor that activates hundreds of endogenous genes (for example, ZSCAN4, KDM4E and PRAMEF-family genes) and retroviral elements (MERVL/HERVL family) that define the cleavage-specific transcriptional programs in humans and mice. Remarkably, mouse Dux expression is both necessary and sufficient to convert mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into 2-cell-embryo-like ('2C-like') cells, measured here by the reactivation of '2C' genes and repeat elements, the loss of POU5F1 (also known as OCT4) protein and chromocenters, and the conversion of the chromatin landscape (as assessed by transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq)) to a state strongly resembling that of mouse 2C embryos. Thus, we propose mouse DUX and human DUX4 as major drivers of the cleavage or 2C state."
https://openalex.org/W2611165465,"In animal embryos, transcription is mostly silent for several cell divisions, until the release of the first major wave of embryonic transcripts through so-called zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Maternally provided ZGA-triggering factors have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster and Danio rerio, but their mammalian homologs are still undefined. Here, we provide evidence that the DUX family of transcription factors is essential to this process in mice and potentially in humans. First, human DUX4 and mouse Dux are both expressed before ZGA in their respective species. Second, both orthologous proteins bind the promoters of ZGA-associated genes and activate their transcription. Third, Dux knockout in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) prevents the cells from cycling through a 2-cell-like state. Finally, zygotic depletion of Dux leads to impaired early embryonic development and defective ZGA. We conclude that DUX-family proteins are key inducers of zygotic genome activation in placental mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2611929604,"Stephen Tapscott and colleagues report that human DUX4, which is linked to facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, and mouse DUX activate genes associated with cleavage-stage embryos, including retrotransposons, in muscle cells. They suggest that the ancestral DUX4-regulated genes characteristic of cleavage-stage embryos are driven by conventional promoters, whereas divergence of the DUX4 and DUX homeodomains correlates with retrotransposon specificity. Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD; MIM 158900 , MIM 158901 ) is caused by misexpression of the DUX4 transcription factor in skeletal muscle1. Animal models of FSHD are hindered by incomplete knowledge regarding the conservation of the DUX4 transcriptional program in other species2,3,4,5. Despite the divergence of their binding motifs, both mouse DUX and human DUX4 in mouse and human muscle cells, respectively, activate genes associated with cleavage-stage embryos, including MERVL and ERVL–MaLR retrotransposons. We found that human DUX4 expressed in mouse cells maintained modest activation of cleavage-stage genes driven by conventional promoters but did not activate MERVL-promoted genes. Thus, the ancestral DUX4-regulated genes are characteristic of cleavage-stage embryos and are driven by conventional promoters, whereas divergence of the DUX4 and DUX homeodomains correlates with retrotransposon specificity. These results provide insight into how species balance conservation of a core transcriptional program with innovation at retrotransposon promoters, and establish a basis for animal models recreating the FSHD transcriptome."
https://openalex.org/W2611952773,"In vivo interrogation of the function of genes implicated in tumorigenesis is limited by the need to generate and cross germline mutant mice. Here we describe approaches to model colorectal cancer (CRC) and metastasis, which rely on in situ gene editing and orthotopic organoid transplantation in mice without cancer-predisposing mutations. Autochthonous tumor formation is induced by CRISPR-Cas9-based editing of the Apc and Trp53 tumor suppressor genes in colon epithelial cells and by orthotopic transplantation of Apc-edited colon organoids. ApcΔ/Δ;KrasG12D/+;Trp53Δ/Δ (AKP) mouse colon organoids and human CRC organoids engraft in the distal colon and metastasize to the liver. Finally, we apply the orthotopic transplantation model to characterize the clonal dynamics of Lgr5+ stem cells and demonstrate sequential activation of an oncogene in established colon adenomas. These experimental systems enable rapid in vivo characterization of cancer-associated genes and reproduce the entire spectrum of tumor progression and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2611509799,"Respiratory viral infections represent the most common cause of allergic asthma exacerbations. Amplification of the type-2 immune response is strongly implicated in asthma exacerbation, but how virus infection boosts type-2 responses is poorly understood. We report a significant correlation between the release of host double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) following rhinovirus infection and the exacerbation of type-2 allergic inflammation in humans. In a mouse model of allergic airway hypersensitivity, we show that rhinovirus infection triggers dsDNA release associated with the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), known as NETosis. We further demonstrate that inhibiting NETosis by blocking neutrophil elastase or by degrading NETs with DNase protects mice from type-2 immunopathology. Furthermore, the injection of mouse genomic DNA alone is sufficient to recapitulate many features of rhinovirus-induced type-2 immune responses and asthma pathology. Thus, NETosis and its associated extracellular dsDNA contribute to the pathogenesis and may represent potential therapeutic targets of rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations."
https://openalex.org/W2610774430,"Transcriptional programs control cellular lineage commitment and differentiation during development. Understanding of cell fate has been advanced by studying single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) but is limited by the assumptions of current analytic methods regarding the structure of data. We present single-cell topological data analysis (scTDA), an algorithm for topology-based computational analyses to study temporal, unbiased transcriptional regulation. Unlike other methods, scTDA is a nonlinear, model-independent, unsupervised statistical framework that can characterize transient cellular states. We applied scTDA to the analysis of murine embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation in vitro in response to inducers of motor neuron differentiation. scTDA resolved asynchrony and continuity in cellular identity over time and identified four transient states (pluripotent, precursor, progenitor, and fully differentiated cells) based on changes in stage-dependent combinations of transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). scTDA can be applied to study asynchronous cellular responses to either developmental cues or environmental perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2610506730,"Human pluripotent stem cells are differentiated into inner ear organoids containing cells similar to hair cells and sensory neurons. The derivation of human inner ear tissue from pluripotent stem cells would enable in vitro screening of drug candidates for the treatment of hearing and balance dysfunction and may provide a source of cells for cell-based therapies of the inner ear. Here we report a method for differentiating human pluripotent stem cells to inner ear organoids that harbor functional hair cells. Using a three-dimensional culture system, we modulate TGF, BMP, FGF, and WNT signaling to generate multiple otic-vesicle-like structures from a single stem-cell aggregate. Over 2 months, the vesicles develop into inner ear organoids with sensory epithelia that are innervated by sensory neurons. Additionally, using CRISPR–Cas9, we generate an ATOH1-2A-eGFP cell line to detect hair cell induction and demonstrate that derived hair cells exhibit electrophysiological properties similar to those of native sensory hair cells. Our culture system should facilitate the study of human inner ear development and research on therapies for diseases of the inner ear."
https://openalex.org/W2609504358,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with severe neuropathology in neonates as well as Guillain-Barré syndrome and other neurologic disorders in adults. Prolonged viral shedding has been reported in semen, suggesting the presence of anatomic viral reservoirs. Here we show that ZIKV can persist in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and lymph nodes (LN) of infected rhesus monkeys for weeks after virus has been cleared from peripheral blood, urine, and mucosal secretions. ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies correlated with rapid clearance of virus in peripheral blood but remained undetectable in CSF for the duration of the study. Viral persistence in both CSF and LN correlated with upregulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), proinflammatory, and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways, as well as downregulation of extracellular matrix signaling pathways. These data raise the possibility that persistent or occult neurologic and lymphoid disease may occur following clearance of peripheral virus in ZIKV-infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2610846186,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of death in the developed world, yet facile preclinical models that mimic the natural stages of CRC progression are lacking. Through the orthotopic engraftment of colon organoids we describe a broadly usable immunocompetent CRC model that recapitulates the entire adenoma-adenocarcinoma-metastasis axis in vivo. The engraftment procedure takes less than 5 minutes, shows efficient tumor engraftment in two-thirds of mice, and can be achieved using organoids derived from genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), wild-type organoids engineered ex vivo, or from patient-derived human CRC organoids. In this model, we describe the genotype and time-dependent progression of CRCs from adenocarcinoma (6 weeks), to local disseminated disease (11-12 weeks), and spontaneous metastasis (>20 weeks). Further, we use the system to show that loss of dysregulated Wnt signaling is critical for the progression of disseminated CRCs. Thus, our approach provides a fast and flexible means to produce tailored CRC mouse models for genetic studies and pre-clinical investigation."

Central to this process is the expansion of undifferentiated intermediates known as transit-amplifying (TA) cells, but how stem cells are triggered to enter this proliferative TA state remains an important open question. Using the continuously growing mouse incisor as a model of stem cell-based tissue renewal, we found that the transcriptional cofactors YAP and TAZ are required both to maintain TA cell proliferation and to inhibit differentiation. Specifically, we identified a pathway involving activation of integrin α3 in TA cells that signals through an LATS-independent FAK/CDC42/PP1A cascade to control YAP-S397 phosphorylation and nuclear localization. This leads to Rheb expression and potentiates mTOR signaling to drive the proliferation of TA cells. These findings thus reveal a YAP/TAZ signaling mechanism that coordinates stem cell expansion and differentiation during organ renewal.

These findings thus reveal a YAP/TAZ signaling mechanism that coordinates stem cell expansion and differentiation during organ renewal. As an organ ages, replacement of worn or injured tissue depends on resident somatic stem cells that have the ability to self-renew and generate differentiated cells. This stem cell-based renewal is particularly important for maintaining the homeostasis of tissues with constant cell turnover, such as the hematopoietic system, the intestinal epithelium, germ cells in the testis, and various epidermal appendages such as hair follicles and teeth (Wabik and Jones, 2015Wabik A. Jones P.H. Switching roles: the functional plasticity of adult tissue stem cells.EMBO J. 2015; 34: 1164-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). During tissue renewal, stem cells or their proliferative descendants, known as transit-amplifying (TA) cells, divide regularly in order to meet the homeostatic demands of each tissue. The induction of stem and progenitor cell proliferation, as well as the differentiation of their progeny, must therefore be tightly regulated. Uncontrolled proliferation can lead to tissue hyperplasia (White et al., 2014White A.C. Khuu J.K. Dang C.Y. Hu J. Tran K.V. Liu A. Gomez S. Zhang Z. Yi R.

Thus, a central goal in stem cell biology is to understand the mechanisms that govern proliferation and differentiation of stem and TA cells in vivo. The adult mouse incisor provides a paradigm for studying tissue renewal and regeneration. This organ continuously replaces tissues lost, as a result of abrasion from gnawing, through the activity of epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells that give rise to all adult tooth cell types, including ameloblasts and odontoblasts that produce enamel and dentin, respectively (Biehs et al., 2013Biehs B.

In particular, ameloblasts are derived from dental epithelial stem cells (DESCs) in the labial cervical loop (laCL), the niche region at the proximal end of the incisor (Figure 1A). Lineage tracing has shown that DESCs, marked by Gli1, Bmi1, and Sox2, reside in the outer enamel epithelium (OEE) and the underlying stellate reticulum (SR) of the laCL (Figure 1B) and have the capacity to both self-renew and give rise to ameloblasts and stratum intermedium cells (Biehs et al., 2013Biehs B.

Schober M. et al.Hedgehog signaling regulates the generation of ameloblast progenitors in the continuously growing mouse incisor.Development. 2010; 137: 3753-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The production of ameloblasts from progenitors thus resembles a conveyor belt, where the less proliferative DESCs originating from the OEE first give rise to rapidly dividing TA cells in the inner enamel epithelium (IEE) that then move distally along the length of the epithelium as they cease proliferation and undergo differentiation. Therefore, as in other tissues with constant cell turnover, the function of the incisor depends on proper regulation of TA cell proliferation and differentiation. However, what mechanisms control these processes remains an open question. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its homolog, transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), are effectors of the evolutionarily conserved Hippo signaling pathway, and they play key roles in coordinating cell proliferation and differentiation (Yu et al., 2015Yu F.-X.

For example, overexpression of activated YAP results in progenitor pool expansion, tissue hyperplasia, and altered differentiation in the skin, intestine, liver, and lung (Schlegelmilch et al., 2011Schlegelmilch K.

These signals are in part relayed through the MAP4K/MST1/2-LATS1/2 kinase cascade, where activated phospho-LATS1/2 phosphorylate YAP/TAZ on several serine residues, including serine 127 (S127; S89 in TAZ), leading to YAP/TAZ translocation to the cytoplasm, and serine 397 (S397; S311 in TAZ), resulting in protein degradation (Zhao et al., 2010Zhao B.

A coordinated phosphorylation by Lats and CK1 regulates YAP stability through SCF(beta-TRCP).Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 72-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). In addition to LATS-dependent regulation, phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ can be controlled by non-LATS kinases (e.g., SRC kinase) and phosphatases (e.g., Protein Phosphatase 1A [PP1A] and PP2A) (Li et al., 2016Li P.

Yap1 acts downstream of α-catenin to control epidermal proliferation.Cell. 2011; 144: 782-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). However, as many of the studies to date focusing on YAP/TAZ regulation have been conducted in cell culture, critical questions that remain to be addressed are whether these upstream signals and regulations are physiologically relevant and how they control YAP/TAZ function to drive proper stem cell proliferation and differentiation in a tissue. Here we report that YAP and TAZ play functionally redundant roles in the adult incisor laCL to maintain TA cell proliferation and survival, as well as to inhibit precocious differentiation. This occurs in part through the control of Rheb expression and subsequent effects on mTOR activation. The regulation of YAP in TA cells depends on the induction of the ITGA3-FAK-CDC42 signaling axis specifically in the TA region, which promotes interaction between PP1A and YAP and dephosphorylation on YAP-S397 in a LATS-independent manner that is distinct from the S127-guided regulation described previously. This novel regulatory pathway thus drives YAP accumulation in the TA cell nuclei, enabling the transition of stem cells into a high-proliferation TA state in order to maintain proper tissue homeostasis. Because YAP and TAZ are important regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation, we set out to study the roles of these proteins in the regulation of adult incisor renewal. We first assessed their expression in wild-type laCLs by in situ hybridization, and we found that both Yap and Taz are abundantly expressed in the laCL (Figures S1A and S1B), with the strongest expression detected in the TA cells. As the localization of YAP and TAZ in the nucleus or cytoplasm is a key determinant of their function, we next carried out immunostaining to examine their subcellular distribution in the laCL. In accordance with the notion that nuclear YAP tends to promote proliferation, we observed high levels of nuclear YAP in the proliferating TA cells that were marked by Ki67 immunostaining and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (Figures 1C–1E and 1M). This was in contrast to the low-proliferating DESC/OEE region, where we observed minimal nuclear YAP and weak cytoplasmic staining (Figures 1C–1E). A similar YAP expression pattern was also observed in the lingual CL (Figure S1C). Interestingly, the expression pattern of YAP subcellular localization in the laCL was not mirrored by TAZ, which was expressed exclusively in the cytoplasm (Figures 1K and 1K’), suggesting that YAP and TAZ are regulated differently in the laCL. To investigate the functional requirement of YAP in the laCL, we genetically deleted Yap in the adult dental epithelium. We crossed a Yap conditional allele (Yapf/f) (Xin et al., 2011Xin M. Kim Y. Sutherland L.B. Qi X. McAnally J. Schwartz R.J. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Regulation of insulin-like growth factor signaling by Yap governs cardiomyocyte proliferation and embryonic heart size.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: ra70Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) with Keratin 14CreER (K14CreER) (Li et al., 2000Li M. Indra A.K. Warot X. Brocard J. Messaddeq N. Kato S. Metzger D. Chambon P. Skin abnormalities generated by temporally controlled RXRalpha mutations in mouse epidermis.Nature. 2000; 407: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), in which tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase is expressed in the incisor epithelium (Figures S1D–S1F), to generate K14CreER;Yapf/f conditional knockout (cKO) mutants (YapcKO). We first examined the general architecture of the laCL by H&E staining 1 week after injection of 8-week-old mice with tamoxifen (Figure 1F). To our surprise, most YapcKO mutant laCLs were morphologically indistinguishable from the Cre-negative controls (n = 9/12) (Figures 1G and 1H), although in a minority of samples (n = 3/12) the laCLs were disorganized and exhibited small holes in the tissue (Figures S1K and S1L). We therefore considered the possibility that loss of YAP could be compensated for by TAZ, and this was supported by increased nuclear TAZ in YapcKO laCLs (Figures 1L and 1L’). As TAZ single deletion (TazcKO) had no effect on the laCL (Figure 1I), we generated Yap/TazcKO double mutants. Deletion of both Yap and Taz caused cells in the TA and SR regions to detach from one another by 4 days after Cre induction (Figures S1M and S1N), and by 7 days after Cre induction there was a remarkable tissue loss in the SR and TA regions (n = 12/12) (Figures S1O and S1P). In the most severe cases, the entire laCL was lost and a large hole developed (Figure 1J). A similar phenotype was also observed in the lingual CL (Figure S1S and S1T), suggesting a conserved YAP/TAZ function in different populations of DESCs. The loss of tissue was confirmed by computed microtomography (μCT), which enables visualization of tissues without the potential for causing histological artifacts (Figures S1Q and S1R). Because Yap/TazcKO animals gradually ceased eating and became moribund 7–10 days after Cre initiation, likely due to the requirement for YAP/TAZ function in other epithelial organs, we were unable to assess the long-term consequences on mineral deposition in the distal incisor. The dramatic loss of the laCL in Yap/TazcKO could be attributed to decreased proliferation, increased cell death, or both. We first measured the percentage of proliferating cells by BrdU labeling 2 days after Cre induction (Figure 1F), a time point prior to the laCL destruction. We took advantage of the mosaic nature of tamoxifen-induced Cre recombination to compare BrdU labeling in cells with and without YAP/TAZ deletion within the same laCL. While there was a significant reduction of proliferation in YAP-negative TA and SR cells, BrdU signals were still present in cells with intact YAP expression (Figures 1M–1P and 1T). We next marked apoptotic cells using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). We utilized the Cre-responsive reporter allele R26mT/mG (Muzumdar et al., 2007Muzumdar M.D. Tasic B. Miyamichi K. Li L. Luo L. A global double-fluorescent Cre reporter mouse.Genesis. 2007; 45: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar) to identify cells that underwent Cre recombination and were permanently labeled with membrane GFP (mG) (Figures S1D–S1J’); cells lacking Cre activity continued to express membrane tdTomato (mT). Using this strategy, we noted an increase in apoptosis among Yap/TazcKO cells, primarily in SR and distal TA cells; apoptosis also occurred in the OEE after the loss of TA/SR cells at a later time point (Figures 1Q–1S and S1U–S1X). Lastly, we tested the role of YAP/TAZ in laCL cell expansion using in vitro colony formation assays. Dissociated cells from control K14CreER;R26mT/mG laCLs routinely formed spheroids in 3D culture, whereas GFP-positive Yap/TazcKO;R26mT/mG mutant cells remained as single cells (Figures 1U–1Y). In contrast, Yap/TazcKO;R26mT/mG cells that escaped Cre activation (tdTomato-positive) maintained their ability to form colonies. Together, these results demonstrate an absolute requirement for YAP/TAZ in sustaining cell proliferation and survival in the adult incisor laCL. As YAP/TAZ are transcriptional cofactors, we next performed gene expression profiling using RNA from control and Yap/TazcKO laCLs 2 days after Cre induction, allowing us to detect early changes that occurred prior to tissue destruction. Among targets that were upregulated, we found several genes that mark differentiated ameloblasts, such as Amelogenin and Ameloblastin (Figure 2A). Increased expression of these genes was confirmed by qPCR analysis, immunoblotting, and in situ hybridization (Figures 2B, 2C, and S1Y–S1AB). Finally, we performed Amelogenin and Ameloblastin immunostaining, and we observed that, while these ameloblast markers were not expressed in control laCLs, they were readily detected in the Yap/TazcKO SR cells (Figures 2D–2G), indicating that, in the absence of YAP/TAZ, some laCL cells undergo precocious differentiation. Our gene expression analysis identified a set of genes that were downregulated, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway was one of the top modules affected (Table S1). In particular, expression of Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain), which encodes an activator of the mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1), was reduced in the absence of YAP/TAZ (Figures 2A, 2B, and 3K ). Furthermore, while immunostaining revealed that RHEB was expressed robustly throughout the entire TA and SR regions of control laCLs, its expression in Yap/TazcKO;R26mT/mG was downregulated in TA and SR cells that had undergone Cre-mediated recombination, as visualized by the presence of membrane GFP (Figures 3A, 3C–3E’, 3I, S2A, and S2B). These results thus suggest that mTOR signaling is compromised in Yap/TazcKO. We tested this hypothesis by examining the expression of phospho-P70-S6 kinase (pS6K1) and phospho-translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (p4EBP), two readouts of active mTOR signaling (Hay and Sonenberg, 2004Hay N. Sonenberg N. Upstream and downstream of mTOR.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). In line with RHEB expression, robust staining of pS6K1 and p4EBP was detected uniformly in control TA and underlying SR cells (Figures 3F, 3F’, S2E, and S2E’), while their expression was significantly decreased in Yap/TazcKO;R26mT/mG laCLs (Figures 3G–3H’, 3J, and S2C–S2J). These results were confirmed by immunoblotting (Figure 3L). Because mTOR signaling functions as a central regulator of cell proliferation and survival (Laplante and Sabatini, 2009Laplante M. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3589-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the decreased mTOR activity in Yap/TazcKO could explain some of the phenotypes we observed earlier, and thus that perturbation of the mTOR pathway may partially phenocopy Yap/TazcKO. We first took an explant approach, in which dissected wild-type proximal incisors were cultured (Figure 3M) in the presence or absence of the mTORC1 inhibitor Rapamycin. In control samples, cells continued to proliferate, while Rapamycin-treated incisors had reduced proliferation (Figures 3N–3P). To confirm the tissue-autonomous role of mTOR signaling in laCLs, we next perturbed mTOR signaling by using K14CreER to conditionally delete Regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Rptor), which encodes a critical regulator of mTORC1 (Hara et al., 2002Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Raptor, a binding partner of target of rapamycin (TOR), mediates TOR action.Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). The resultant RptorcKO mutants displayed a reduction in BrdU-labeled cells 18 hr after Cre induction (Figures 3B, 3Q–3S, and S2N). The importance of Rptor for progenitor pool expansion became even more obvious in longer-chased RptorcKO samples, as there was a near-complete loss of GFP-positive Cre-recombined mutant TA cells and ameloblasts, which were replaced by proliferative GFP-negative wild-type cells (Figures S2K–S2M’). Together, these results demonstrated that YAP/TAZ-mediated mTOR activation is critical for expanding the progenitor pool in laCLs. Given the critical roles that YAP/TAZ play in laCL maintenance, we set out to study the underlying mechanism that controls YAP nuclear localization in TA cells. We focused on YAP because our results above indicated that YAP is the primary regulator of TA proliferation and differentiation, with TAZ serving as a redundant alternate in the absence of YAP. To that end, we carried out a small-scale screen using the explant culture system in combination with inhibitors of several known YAP regulators (Table S2). While most of the drugs tested did not affect YAP nuclear localization in TA cells (data not shown), the FAK inhibitor PF573228 impeded YAP accumulation in the nucleus (n = 12/12; Figures 4A and 4B ), suggesting that integrin/FAK signaling may play a role in YAP regulation in the laCL (Figure 4F). Similarly, incisors treated with PP2, an inhibitor of SRC kinase that functions downstream of FAK, also had reduced nuclear YAP (n = 4/6; Figure 4C). Consistent with these results, immunostaining of phospho-FAK and -SRC (pFAK and pSRC) showed active FAK signaling in the TA region, but not in the OEE where there was low nuclear YAP (Figures 4D and 4E). To further study whether FAK is required in the adult laCL for YAP nuclear localization, we deleted Fak in the dental epithelium by generating K14CreER;Fakf/f;R26mT/mG (FakcKO) mice. Similar to our explant studies, deletion of Fak resulted in loss of nuclear YAP in both TA and adjacent SR cells (Figures 4G–4J’). The reduction in nuclear YAP was quantified by calculating the percentage of YAP/DAPI overlap in control and FakcKO TA/SR cells (Figures 4K–4M), as well as by comparing the average nuclear YAP signal intensity both between control and mutant laCLs and between Cre-recombined (GFP-positive) and non-recombined (GFP-negative) cells in FakcKO (Figures S3A and S3B). Having established FAK as an upstream regulator of YAP, we sought to find the corresponding integrin receptor by first screening the spatial distribution of potential integrin subunits that were expressed in the laCL based on our microarray data. We found that integrin α3 (ITGA3) was specifically expressed in the TA region and in the neighboring SR cells (Figure 4N). To investigate if ITGA3 functions upstream of YAP, we examined K14Cre;Itga3f/f mice (Itga3cKO), where Itga3 was deleted in the entire dental epithelium (Figure 4O). In these mutants, there was a significant loss of nuclear YAP in TA cells, although SR cells were not affected (Figures 4P–4T and S3C). These data suggest that ITGA3 plays a dominant role in governing YAP localization in the TA region (Figure 4U), with other integrin subunits (such as ITGAV, which is present in the TA/SR regions as well; data not shown) performing similar functions in the SR. We also noted that, similar to YapcKO, both Itga3cKO and FakcKO laCLs appeared normal and had increased nuclear TAZ (Figures S4A–S4C’ and S4E), reinforcing the notion that compensation by TAZ ensues following disrupted YAP activities. To test this, we generated Fak/TazcKO double mutants, and we found that laCLs from these animals had"

Spider silks are largely composed of spidroins, a unique family of structural proteins. To investigate spidroin genes systematically, we constructed the first genome of an orb-weaving spider: the golden orb-weaver (Nephila clavipes), which builds large webs using an extensive repertoire of silks with diverse physical properties. We cataloged 28 Nephila spidroins, representing all known orb-weaver spidroin types, and identified 394 repeated coding motif variants and higher-order repetitive cassette structures unique to specific spidroins. Characterization of spidroin expression in distinct silk gland types indicates that glands can express multiple spidroin types. We find evidence of an alternatively spliced spidroin, a spidroin expressed only in venom glands, evolutionary mechanisms for spidroin diversification, and non-spidroin genes with expression patterns that suggest roles in silk production."
https://openalex.org/W2611542292,"Blood vessels in the central nervous system (CNS) are controlled by neuronal activity. For example, widespread vessel constriction (vessel tone) is induced by brainstem neurons that release the monoamines serotonin and noradrenaline, and local vessel dilation is induced by glutamatergic neuron activity. Here we examined how vessel tone adapts to the loss of neuron-derived monoamines after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. We find that, months after the imposition of SCI, the spinal cord below the site of injury is in a chronic state of hypoxia owing to paradoxical excess activity of monoamine receptors (5-HT1) on pericytes, despite the absence of monoamines. This monoamine-receptor activity causes pericytes to locally constrict capillaries, which reduces blood flow to ischemic levels. Receptor activation in the absence of monoamines results from the production of trace amines (such as tryptamine) by pericytes that ectopically express the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), which synthesizes trace amines directly from dietary amino acids (such as tryptophan). Inhibition of monoamine receptors or of AADC, or even an increase in inhaled oxygen, produces substantial relief from hypoxia and improves motoneuron and locomotor function after SCI."

Using a task that assesses the financial cost participants ascribe to harming others versus themselves, we probed the relationship between moral behavior and neural representations of profit and pain. Most participants displayed moral preferences, placing a higher cost on harming others than themselves. Moral preferences correlated with neural responses to profit, where participants with stronger moral preferences had lower dorsal striatal responses to profit gained from harming others. Lateral prefrontal cortex encoded profit gained from harming others, but not self, and tracked the blameworthiness of harmful choices. Moral decisions also modulated functional connectivity between lateral prefrontal cortex and the profit-sensitive region of dorsal striatum. The findings suggest moral behavior in our task is linked to a neural devaluation of reward realized by a prefrontal modulation of striatal value representations."

Here, we used Cas9-based genome editing to introduce the gene encoding the prodrug-converting enzyme herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) into the genomes of cancer cells carrying unique sequences resulting from genome rearrangements. Specifically, we targeted the breakpoints of TMEM135-CCDC67 and MAN2A1-FER fusions in human prostate cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in mouse xenografts. We designed one adenovirus to deliver the nickase Cas9D10A and guide RNAs targeting the breakpoint sequences, and another to deliver an EGFP-HSV1-tk construct flanked by sequences homologous to those surrounding the breakpoint. Infection with both viruses resulted in breakpoint-dependent expression of EGFP-tk and ganciclovir-mediated apoptosis. When mouse xenografts were treated with adenoviruses and ganciclovir, all animals showed decreased tumor burden and no mortality during the study. Thus, Cas9-mediated suicide-gene insertion may be a viable genotype-specific cancer therapy."

Here, SIRT5 was observed to bind to cardiolipin via an amphipathic helix on its N terminus. In vitro, succinyl-CoA was used to succinylate liver mitochondrial membrane proteins. SIRT5 largely reversed the succinyl-CoA-driven lysine succinylation. Quantitative mass spectrometry of SIRT5-treated membrane proteins pointed to the electron transport chain, particularly Complex I, as being highly targeted for desuccinylation by SIRT5. Correspondingly, SIRT5−/− HEK293 cells showed defects in both Complex I- and Complex II-driven respiration. In mouse liver, SIRT5 expression was observed to localize strictly to the periportal hepatocytes. However, homogenates prepared from whole SIRT5−/− liver did show reduced Complex II-driven respiration. The enzymatic activities of Complex II and ATP synthase were also significantly reduced. Three-dimensional modeling of Complex II suggested that several SIRT5-targeted lysine residues lie at the protein-lipid interface of succinate dehydrogenase subunit B. We postulate that succinylation at these sites may disrupt Complex II subunit-subunit interactions and electron transfer. Lastly, SIRT5−/− mice, like humans with Complex II deficiency, were found to have mild lactic acidosis. Our findings suggest that SIRT5 is targeted to protein complexes on the inner mitochondrial membrane via affinity for cardiolipin to promote respiratory chain function."
https://openalex.org/W2611535275,"Neuroblastoma (NBL) is an embryonal cancer of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which causes 15% of pediatric cancer deaths. High-risk NBL is characterized by N-Myc amplification and segmental chromosomal gains and losses. Owing to limited disease models, the etiology of NBL is largely unknown, including both the cell of origin and the majority of oncogenic drivers. We have established a novel system for studying NBL based on the transformation of neural crest cells (NCCs), the progenitor cells of the SNS, isolated from mouse embryonic day 9.5 trunk neural tube explants. Based on pathology and gene expression analysis, we report the first successful transformation of wild-type NCCs into NBL by enforced expression of N-Myc, to generate phenotypically and molecularly accurate tumors that closely model human MYCN-amplified NBL. Using comparative genomic hybridization, we found that NCC-derived NBL tumors acquired copy number gains and losses that are syntenic to those observed in human MYCN-amplified NBL including 17q gain, 2p gain and loss of 1p36. When p53-compromised NCCs were transformed with N-Myc, we generated primitive neuroectodermal tumors with divergent differentiation including osteosarcoma. These subcutaneous tumors were metastatic to regional lymph nodes, liver and lung. Our novel experimental approach accurately models human NBL and establishes a new system with potential to study early stages of NBL oncogenesis, to functionally assess NBL oncogenic drivers and to characterize NBL metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2611430368,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterized by genome-wide alterations to DNA methylation that influence gene expression and genomic stability. Less is known about the extent to which methylation is disrupted in the earliest stages of CRC development. In this study, we have combined laser-capture microdissection with reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to identify cancer-associated DNA methylation changes in human aberrant crypt foci (ACF), the earliest putative precursor to CRC. Using this approach, methylation profiles have been generated for 10 KRAS-mutant ACF and 10 CRCs harboring a KRAS mutation, as well as matched samples of normal mucosa. Of 811 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) identified in ACF, 537 (66%) were hypermethylated and 274 (34%) were hypomethylated. DMRs located within intergenic regions were heavily enriched for AP-1 transcription factor binding sites and were frequently hypomethylated. Furthermore, gene ontology analysis demonstrated that DMRs associated with promoters were enriched for genes involved in intestinal development, including homeobox genes and targets of the Polycomb repressive complex 2. Consistent with their role in the earliest stages of colonic neoplasia, 75% of the loci harboring methylation changes in ACF were also altered in CRC samples, though the magnitude of change at these sites was lesser in ACF. Although aberrant promoter methylation was associated with altered gene expression in CRC, this was not the case in ACF, suggesting the insufficiency of methylation changes to modulate gene expression in early colonic neoplasia. Altogether, these data demonstrate that DNA methylation changes, including significant hypermethylation, occur more frequently in early colonic neoplasia than previously believed, and identify epigenomic features of ACF that may provide new targets for cancer chemoprevention or lead to the development of new biomarkers for CRC risk."

However, treatment with type I interferons has not been effective in patients with EV71 infection. In this study, we found that in cells pretreated with IFN-β, EV71 infection could still lead to a cytopathic effect, and the viral replication was not affected.

Type I interferon response is the first line of defense against viral infection through suppression of viral replication and by blocking viral spread, mediated by hundreds of interferon-inducible genes (ISGs). Type I IFNs induce the ISGs through the JAK/STAT signal pathway (4Platanias L.C. Mechanisms of type-I- and type-II-interferon-mediated signalling.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar, 5Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Jak-STAT pathways and transcriptional activation in response to IFNs and other extracellular signaling proteins.Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar). First, type I interferons (IFN-α/β) bind to heterodimeric receptors consisting of interferon-α receptors 1 (IFNAR1) and 2 (IFNAR2), causing transphosphorylation and activation of the “Janus” tyrosine kinases Tyk2 and Jak1. Then the STATs are recruited to the receptor-bound Jaks and phosphorylated at tyrosine. Phosphorylated STAT1/2 subsequently associates with IFN-regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form a heterotrimeric complex, named interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which is translocated to the nucleus and binds the IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) to activate transcription of ISGs. Accumulated evidence shows that viral infections can circumvent the IFN response by either suppressing IFN induction or blocking IFN stimulation to induce ISGs (6Weber F. Kochs G. Haller O.

Mechanisms of type-I- and type-II-interferon-mediated signalling.Nat. Rev.

We aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which EV71 resists the antiviral effect of IFNs and reconcile previously reported conflicting data. In this study, we report that in HeLa cells, IFNAR1 or JAK1 was not significantly down-regulated in expression or degraded during EV71 infection in cell cultures with an inoculum of the virus at an m.o.i. of either 1 or 10. EV71 infection did not affect the phosphorylation of STAT1/2, indicating that IFNs binds to the receptor and that Jaks function well. Our data indicated that EV71 disrupted the interaction of STAT1 and KPNA1 by inducing degradation of KPNA1, resulting in the blockage of the translocation of p-STAT1/2 into the nucleus. Moreover, we provide evidence to show that KPNA1, a nuclear localization signal receptor for p-STAT1, was degraded through a caspase-3-dependent process induced during EV71 infection. Our data demonstrate a novel mechanism for EV71 resist IFN-mediated host antiviral response. We started by evaluating antiviral effect of IFN-β on EV71 replication in an in vitro culture. Vero cells were pretreated with IFN-β at varying concentrations 2 h prior to EV71 infection at an m.o.i. of 0.2 and observed under a light microscope for cytopathic effect (CPE). Apparent CPE occurred in both pretreated and untreated cells at 48 h postinfection (p.i.), and no difference was exhibited in cells treated with IFN-β ranging from 100 to 1,000 ng/ml (Fig. 1A). Culture supernatants were collected at 48 h p.i. for infectious viral titration. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in viral titers (TCID50) between IFN-β untreated and treated cells. IFN-β had no evident inhibitory effect on EV71 replication even at a high concentration of 1,000 ng/ml (Fig. 1B). We also extracted total RNA or prepared cell lysates from infected cells and examined the viral VP1 gene transcript levels by real-time PCR and VP1 at protein levels by Western blotting, respectively. No significant changes between the cells treated with IFN-β or left untreated were detected in VP1 both at RNA transcript (Fig. 1C) and protein (Fig. 1D) levels. Taken together, these findings showed that IFN-β failed to inhibit EV71 replication in cell cultures pretreated at high concentrations of up to 1,000 ng/ml. Type I IFN signaling leads to induction of a variety of ISGs. To validate the inhibitory effect of EV71 on IFN-β signaling, we examined the expression of ISGs induced by IFN-β in cells either infected or uninfected with EV71. HeLa cells were infected with EV71 for 24 h and then further treated with IFN-β at 20 ng/ml or left untreated for another 15 h. Total RNA was prepared from the cells for real-time RT-PCR analyses to measure the induction of ISGs. As shown in Fig. 2, the transcript levels of MX1, MX2, OAS1, IFI27, ISG54, and ISG56 increased up to 128.5-, 700.4-, 225.7-, 443.7-, 84.2-, and 94.1-fold, respectively, in IFN-β-treated cells compared with those in untreated cells. However, in IFN-β-treated cells infected with EV71, the induction of MX1, MX2, OAS1, IFI27, ISG54, and ISG56 transcripts was present up only to 29.9-, 117.1-, 37.5-, 73.2-, 20.3-, and 21.5-fold, respectively, significantly lower than IFN-β-treated cells without EV71 infection (Fig. 2A). The induction of ISGs in EV7-infected cells without IFN-β stimulation was barely detectable, similar to that in mock-treated cells (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that IFN-β signaling is strongly suppressed in EV71-infected Vero cells. We were able to demonstrate that suppression of IFN-β signaling was dependent on EV71 replication, because the inhibitory effect on the induction of ISGs disappeared when the cells were infected with inactivated EV71 without effective viral replication. EV71 virions inactivated by UV illumination were used for infection in Vero cells, and viral inactivation was verified by our failure to detect viral replication at 72 h p.i. The induction of ISG transcripts were comparable in IFN-β-treated cells, which were later inoculated with inactivated viruses (Fig. 2B). In parallel we collected cell lysates from infected or uninfected cells, stimulated with or without IFN-β, and subjected them to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2C, the expression of MX1 and MX2 was clearly induced by IFN-β stimulation, which was, however, significantly down-regulated by EV71 infection, confirming that the expression of ISGs, induced by IFN-β stimulation, was effectively suppressed by EV71 replication. A previous study showed that EV71 infection disrupted IFN signaling by down-regulating the expression of IFNAR1 (10Lu J. Yi L. Zhao J. Yu J. Chen Y. Lin M.C. Kung H.F. He M.L. Enterovirus 71 disrupts interferon signaling by reducing the level of interferon receptor 1.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 3767-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, a recent report found that EV71 down-regulated JAK1, whereas IFNAR1 expression was not significantly altered. To evaluate the EV71 mechanism for antagonizing interferon signaling, we examined the expression of IFNAR1 and JAK1 through EV71 infection. As shown in Fig. 3, our data indicated that no evident changes of IFNAR1 or JAK1 expression occurred during EV71 infection at an m.o.i. of 1 in HeLa or RD cells (Fig. 3, A and B). To validate our finding, we infected the cells with EV71 at an m.o.i. of 10 for 24 h, followed by stimulation of IFN-β for 2 h. The cell lysates were collected and examined by Western blot analysis. Our results showed that with or without IFN-β stimulation, EV71 infection at an m.o.i. of 10 did not alter IFNAR1 or JAK1 expression, even though both IFNAR1 and JAK were up-regulated slightly upon IFN-β stimulation (Fig. 3C). Therefore, we believe that down-regulation of IFNAR1 or JAK1 may not be the mechanism by which EV71 resists IFN signaling, and other mechanisms need to be explored for explaining how EV71 targets IFN-β signaling. To determine the site where IFN-β signaling was targeted by EV71, we first examined STAT1 and STAT2 expression after IFN-β stimulation. HeLa cells were infected with EV71 for 24 h, followed by stimulation with IFN-β at 20 ng/ml for another 30 min. The whole cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with relevant antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3 (D and E), without IFN-β stimulation, STATs were not phosphorylated in EV71-infected cells, probably because of the suppression of IFN signaling by EV71. Our data also showed that after IFN-β stimulation, both STAT1 and STAT2 are significantly up-regulated within a short period. However, EV71 infection at an m.o.i. of either 1 or 10 had no effect on the induced protein levels of either STAT1 or STAT2 (Fig. 3, D and E), indicating that EV71 infection did not target STAT1 or STAT2 for degradation. STAT1/2 are phosphorylated and then associated with IRF9 to form the complex ISGF3, which is subsequently translocated into the nucleus for ISG induction (13Dupuis S. Jouanguy E. Al-Hajjar S. Fieschi C. Al-Mohsen I.Z. Al-Jumaah S. Yang K. Chapgier A. Eidenschenk C. Eid P. Al Ghonaium A. Tufenkeji H. Frayha H. Al-Gazlan S. Al-Rayes H. et al.Impaired response to interferon-α/β and lethal viral disease in human STAT1 deficiency.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 388-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Our results, however, did not detect any difference in phosphorylation status of STAT1 or STAT2 between uninfected and infected cells, although both STAT1 and STAT2 were significantly phosphorylated upon IFN-β stimulation (Fig. 3, D and E). This result suggests that EV71 infection did not target the phosphorylation of STAT1 or STAT2 for suppressing IFN-β signaling. Once STAT1 and STAT2 are phosphorylated upon IFN-β stimulation, the two are associated with IRF9 to assemble and form the ISGF3 complex, which is translocated into the nucleus to initiate gene transcription by binding to ISREs. To examine whether EV71 infection affects the translocation of ISGF3 in JAK/STAT signaling, we infected HeLa cells with EV71 for 24 h, followed by stimulation of IFN-β for 30 min. The cells were fixed and permeabilized before incubation with anti-EV71 VP1 and anti-STAT1 antibodies. Our data indicated that in EV71-infected cells (VP1-positive), STAT1 was almost invisible because of its low expression (Fig. 4B), whereas in IFN-β-stimulated cells without EV71 infection, STAT1 was induced visibly significantly and translocated into the nucleus (Fig. 4C). However, in EV71-infected cells, STAT1 remained mainly in the cytoplasm even though stimulated with IFN-β (Fig. 4D), indicating clearly that EV71 infection blocked STAT1 from translocation into the nucleus. To confirm this observation, we fractionated the cell lysates prepared from uninfected or infected cells, stimulated with IFN-β or not, and collected the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, both STAT1 and STAT2 were phosphorylated upon IFN-β stimulation. In EV71-infected cells, however, p-STAT1 was mostly retained in the cytosol (Fig. 5A), whereas it was present significantly less in the nucleus (Fig. 5B), in contrast to its distribution in uninfected cells. On the other hand, although p-STAT2 was distributed in the cytosol comparably between uninfected and infected cells (Fig. 5A), much less p-STAT2 was present in the nucleus in infected cells (Fig. 5B). These data strongly demonstrate that EV71 infection blocked the translocation of p-STAT1/2 from the cytosol to the nucleus upon IFN-β stimulation. Accumulation of activated p-STAT1 in the nucleus requires its interaction with a specific nuclear localization signal receptor, KPNA1 (9Reid S.P. Leung L.W. Hartman A.L. Martinez O. Shaw M.L. Carbonnelle C. Volchkov V.E. Nichol S.T. Basler C.F. Ebola virus VP24 binds karyopherin α1 and blocks STAT1 nuclear accumulation.J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5156-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 14McBride K.M. Banninger G. McDonald C. Reich N.C. Regulated nuclear import of the STAT1 transcription factor by direct binding of importin-α.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our finding that EV71 infection blocked the IFN-β-stimulated nuclear translocation of p-STAT1/2 raised the possibility that EV71 infection may target a nuclear localization signal receptor. Because KPNA1 is mainly involved in translocation of p-STAT1, we examined whether the interaction of STAT1 and KPNA1 was affected by EV71 infection after IFN-β stimulation. We immunoprecipitated KPNA1 by incubation of cell lysates prepared from infected or control cells with or without IFN-β stimulation, with an anti-KPNA1 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-p-STAT1 antibodies. Our results indicated that KPNA1 was associated with p-STAT1 only in IFN-β-stimulated cells, and EV71 infection significantly decreased the association of KPNA1 and p-STAT1, even though STAT1 was phosphorylated comparably in infected and uninfected cells (Fig. 6A). Importantly, our data suggested that the expression level of KPNA1 was significantly lower in EV71-infected cells, with or without IFN-β stimulation, whereas IFN-β had no impact on KPNA1 expression (Fig. 6A). To confirm this observation in different cell types, we tested KPNA1 expression in RD or Vero cells following EV71 infection by performing Western blot analyses with the anti KPNA1 antibody. The results showed that EV71 infection decreased the levels of KPNA1 in either RD or Vero cells (Fig. 6, B and C), which may account for less formation of the STAT/KPNA1 complex and blocked translocation of p-STAT1 into the nucleus. We further compared the status of IFNAR1, JAK1, KPNA1, and TRIF in Vero and human intestinal epithelial HT-29 cells. We previously showed a robust induction of IFN-β during EV71 infection in HT-29 cells (15Chi C. Sun Q. Wang S. Zhang Z. Li X. Cardona C.J. Jin Y. Xing Z. Robust antiviral responses to enterovirus 71 infection in human intestinal epithelial cells.Virus Res. 2013; 176: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Wang C. Ji L. Yuan X. Jin Y. Cardona C.J. Xing Z. Differential regulation of TLR signaling on the induction of antiviral interferons in human intestinal epithelial cells infected with enterovirus 71.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0152177PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicated that, on the one hand, the levels of IFNAR1 and JAK1 remained unchanged in EV71-infected Vero and HT-29 cells; on the other hand, the levels of both KPNA1 and TRIF decreased in Vero cells (Fig. 6C), but in contrast, those two proteins remained not affected in infected HT-29 cells during the infection (Fig. 6D). These data further confirmed the results that IFNAR1 and JAK1 may not be targeted and degraded during EV71 infection; the targeted proteins would mostly likely be KPNA1 as well as TRIF in Vero cells (and in RD cells). However, none of KPNA1 or TRIF was affected or degraded in EV71-infected HT-29 cells (Fig. 6, C and D). We next aimed to determine what caused the lower level of KPNA1 in EV71-infected cells. It was reported that 3Cpro of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) induced proteasome- and caspase-independent protein degradation of KPNA1 (17Du Y. Bi J. Liu J. Liu X. Wu X. Jiang P. Yoo D. Zhang Y. Wu J. Wan R. Zhao X. Guo L. Sun W. Cong X. Chen L. et al.3Cpro of foot-and-mouth disease virus antagonizes the interferon signaling pathway by blocking STAT1/STAT2 nuclear translocation.J. Virol. 2014; 88: 4908-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus we examined whether 2Apro and 3Cpro of EV71, the two proteases responsible for viral polyprotein processing, had any effect on the degradation of KPNA1 and subsequent IFN-β signaling. We cloned cDNA of EV71 2A and 3C into an expression vector, pRK5, with either an HA or Flag tag. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing tagged 2A protein (2Apro) or 3C protein (3Cpro); their expression is shown in Fig. 7A. The cell lysates were further analyzed with Western blot for KPNA1 expression. Our data showed that ectopic expression of 3Cpro at various doses for transfection could cleave TRIF but had no effect on KPNA1, indicating that KPNA1 was not the cellular target of 3Cpro (Fig. 7A). On the other hand, ectopic expression of 2Apro has almost no effect on degrading KPNA1 as well (Fig. 7B). These data showed that KPNA1 was not the target of both viral proteases 3C and 2A. Our observation was confirmed with a dual-luciferase reporter assay, in which we tested whether 3Cpro or 2Apro had an effect on ISRE promoter activity stimulated by IFN-β. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with reporter plasmid, pISRE-Luc, along with pRK5-HA-2A, pRK5-Flag-3C, or a control plasmid at the indicated doses, respectively. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml of IFN-β. The cell lysates were prepared after 16 h and analyzed for luciferase activities. Our results showed that ectopically 2A- and 3C-expressing cells induced luciferase activity at levels comparable with those of the controls after IFN-β stimulation (Fig. 7C). We also examined the effect of the two viral proteins on the mRNA levels of ISGs induced by IFN-β stimulation with real-time RT-PCR. Our data indicated that overexpression of 2Apro or 3Cpro had little inhibitory effect on the induction of MX1, MX2, IFIH1, IFI27, OAS2, or IFIT1 (Fig. 8). Thus we conclude that either 2Apro or 3Cpro had no role in the degradation of KPNA1 and disruption of KPNA/STAT1 complex and had no role in suppressing ISGs induced by IFN-β signaling. To exclude whether the lowered level of KPNA1 was due to down-regulation or a decrease of mRNA transcription, we measured mRNA levels of KPNA1 during EV71 infection by real-time RT-PCR with a control from uninfected cells and detected no significant changes of the KPNA1 gene transcripts between uninfected and infected cells during various time points, suggesting that KPNA1 was not regulated transcriptionally (Fig. 9A). Cellular proteins are generally degraded by ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation, the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (36Rubinsztein D.C. The roles of intracellular protein-degradation pathways in neurodegeneration.Nature. 2006; 443: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar), or caspase-mediated proteolysis. To assess which pathway was involved in the degradation of KPNA1, the cells were pretreated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 at 5 μm, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) at 10 mm, or a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor quinoline-Val-Asp-difluorophenoxymethylketone (Q-VD-OPH) at 20 nm for 12 h, subsequently followed by infection with EV71 at an m.o.i. of 10 for another 12 h. The cell lysates were harvested for measuring the levels of KPNA1. As shown in Fig. 9, pretreatment with Q-VD-OPH significantly blocked the degradation of KPNA1 in a process induced by EV71 infection, whereas pretreatment with MG132 or 3-MA had no effect on KPNA1 expression, suggesting that EV71-induced degradation of KPNA1 was caspase-dependent (Fig. 9B). To further investigate exactly which caspase was involved in this process, inhibitors for caspase-4 (AC-LEVD-CHO), caspase-8 (Z-IETD-FMK), caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-FMK), and caspase-6 (Z-VEID-FMK) were added to the culture medium for 6 h prior to infection with EV71. The cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 9C, only pretreatment of the cells with the caspase-3-specific inhibitor blocked the degradation of KPNA1 in EV71 infection, thus suggesting that the degradation of KPNA1 during the infection was caspase-3-dependent and that the process of caspase activation was induced by EV71 infection. We also examined the effect of the inhibitors for caspases, proteasome, and autophagy on viral replication in infected cells. HeLa cells were pretreated with MG132, 3-MA, Q-VD-OPH, AC-LEVD-CHO, Z-IETD-FMK, Z-DEVD-FMK, or Z-VEID-FMK, followed by infection with EV71 for another 24 h. Infectious viral titers in the cultural medium were determined, which showed that both Q-VD-OPH and Z-DEVD-FMK significantly decreased virus replication, unlike other caspase inhibitors (Fig. 10, A and B). Pretreatment with MG132 or 3-MA could marginally reduce virus titers (Fig. 10A). Neither of them, however, affected the expression of KPNA1 (Fig. 9B), indicating that the inhibition of proteasome and autophagy affected EV71 replication independent of KPNA1. We further pretreated HeLa cells with or without Z-DEVD-FMK for 6 h, followed by EV71 infection together with IFN-β treatment for another 24 h. The results showed that the inhibitor for caspase-3 increased the level of MX2 in IFN-treated cells during the infection (Fig. 10C), indicating that EV71-suppresed induction of MX2 by IFN-b could be reversed by inhibiting caspase-3 and protecting KPNA1. To confirm the effect of caspase-3 on KPNA1, we transfected the cells with caspase-3 siRNA to knock down caspase-3 expression and then infected cells with EV71 at an m.o.i. of 10 for 24 h. The cell lysates were examined with Western blot analyses, and the results showed that although the levels of caspase-3 decreased in the knockdown cells with siRNA1 and siRNA2, KPNA1 degradation during the infection was inhibited, and the levels of KPNA1 returned to the normal level (Fig. 10D), demonstrating that caspase-3 is involved in the degradation of KPNA1 during EV71 infection. To further understand whether caspase-3 affects retention of STATs in the cytoplasm, we analyzed cytosolic and nuclear fractions of the cells treated with caspase-3-specific siRNA1 in a Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 10 (E and F), in EV71-infected cells, IFN-β-induced STAT2 was predominately retained in the cytoplasm, and in uninfected cells, IFN-β-induced STAT2 was mainly translocated into the nucleus (Fig. 10, E and F). However, when caspase-3 was knocked down by siRNA-1, even though IFN-β-induced STAT2 was still mainly retained in the cytoplasm because of EV71 infection, a significant portion of STAT2 was translocated into the nucleus (Fig. 10F), indicating that knockdown of caspase-3 increased the translocation of STATs into the nucleus. These data support that caspase-3 plays a"

Whether developing postsynaptic neurons establish connections with each presynaptic partner independently or balance inputs to attain specific responses is unclear. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) receive convergent input from bipolar cell types with different contrast responses and temporal tuning. Here, using optogenetic activation and pharmacogenetic silencing, we found that type 6 bipolar (B6) cells dominate excitatory input to ONα-RGCs. We generated mice in which B6 cells were selectively removed from developing circuits (B6-DTA). In B6-DTA mice, ONα-RGCs adjusted connectivity with other bipolar cells in a cell-type-specific manner. They recruited new partners, increased synapses with some existing partners, and maintained constant input from others. Patch-clamp recordings revealed that anatomical rewiring precisely preserved contrast and temporal frequency response functions of ONα-RGCs, indicating that homeostatic plasticity shapes cell-type-specific wiring in the developing retina to stabilize visual information sent to the brain."

Here, we used the social defeat stress paradigm to induce depression-like behavior in rats, then evaluated the behavior of the rats and measured metabolic changes in the prefrontal cortex using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Within the first week after the social defeat procedure, the sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM) and forced swim test (FST) were conducted to examine the depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviors. For our metabolite analysis, multivariate statistics were applied to observe the distribution of all samples and to differentiate the socially defeated group from the control group. Ingenuity pathway analysis was used to find the potential relationships among the differential metabolites. In the OFT and EPM, there were no significant differences between the two experimental groups. In the SPT and FST, socially defeated rats showed less sucrose intake and longer immobility time compared with control rats. Metabolic profiling identified 25 significant variables with good predictability. Ingenuity pathways analysis revealed that ""Hereditary Disorder, Neurological Disease, Lipid Metabolism"" was the most significantly altered network. Stress-induced alterations of low molecular weight metabolites were observed in the prefrontal cortex of rats. Particularly, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and energy metabolism were significantly perturbed. The results of this study suggest that repeated social defeat can lead to metabolic changes and depression-like behavior in rats."

Ultrasound examinations were performed by four trained family physicians with a hand-held ultrasound device (Vscan®). AAA observed were verified by confirmatory imaging using standard ultrasound or computed tomography. Cardiovascular risk factors were determined. The prevalence of AAA was computed as the sum of previously-known aneurysms, aneurysms detected by the screening program and model-based estimated undiagnosed aneurysms. We screened 1,010 men, with mean age of 71.3 (SD 6.9) years; 995 (98.5%) men had normal aortas and 15 (1.5%) had AAA on Vscan®. Eleven out of 14 AAA-cases (78.6%) had AAA on confirmatory imaging (one patient died). The total prevalence of AAA was 2.49% (95%CI 2.20 to 2.78). The median aortic diameter at diagnosis was 3.5 cm in screened patients and 4.7 cm (p<0.001) in patients in whom AAA was diagnosed incidentally. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified coronary heart disease (OR = 4.6, 95%CI 1.3 to 15.9) as the independent factor with the highest odds ratio. A screening program led by trained family physicians using hand-held ultrasound was a feasible, safe and reliable tool for the early detection of AAA."
https://openalex.org/W2611365178,"Eugene Gladyshev and Nancy Kleckner report that the DNMT1-like cytosine methylase DIM-2 can mediate RIP (repeat-induced point mutation) through cytosine-to-thymine mutation of repetitive DNA in Neurospora crassa. They show that this process requires heterochromatin factors and propose a model whereby direct interactions between homologous double-stranded DNA can initiate the formation of heterochromatin. Most eukaryotic genomes contain substantial amounts of repetitive DNA organized in the form of constitutive heterochromatin and associated with repressive epigenetic modifications, such as H3K9me3 and C5 cytosine methylation (5mC). In the fungus Neurospora crassa, H3K9me3 and 5mC are catalyzed, respectively, by a conserved SUV39 histone methyltransferase, DIM-5, and a DNMT1-like cytosine methyltransferase, DIM-2. Here we show that DIM-2 can also mediate repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) of repetitive DNA in N. crassa. We further show that DIM-2-dependent RIP requires DIM-5, HP1, and other known heterochromatin factors, implying a role for a repeat-induced heterochromatin-related process. Our previous findings suggest that the mechanism of repeat recognition for RIP involves direct interactions between homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) segments. We thus now propose that, in somatic cells, homologous dsDNA–dsDNA interactions between a small number of repeat copies can nucleate a transient heterochromatic state, which, on longer repeat arrays, may lead to the formation of constitutive heterochromatin."

In structure modeling tests, we blindly predicted, with near-atomic accuracy, ligand conformations bound to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that have rarely been identified using traditional approaches. We also quantitatively predicted the binding selectivity of diverse ligands to structurally uncharacterized GPCRs. We then applied this technique to design functional human dopamine receptors with novel ligand-binding selectivity. Most blindly predicted ligand-binding specificities closely agreed with experimental validations.

https://openalex.org/W2608749729,"Under predicted global climate change, species will be gradually exposed to warmer temperatures, and to a more variable climate including more intense and more frequent heatwaves. Increased climatic variability is expected to have different effects on species and ecosystems than gradual warming. A key challenge to predict the impact of climate change is to understand how temperature changes will affect species interactions. Herbivorous insects and their natural enemies belong to some of the largest groups of terrestrial animals, and thus they have a great impact on the functioning of ecosystems and on the services these ecosystems provide. Here we studied the life history traits of the plant-feeding insect Plutella xylostella and its specialist endoparasitoid Diadegma semiclausum, when exposed to a daily heat pulse of 5 or 10°C temperature increase during their entire immature phase. Growth and developmental responses differed with the amplitude of the heat pulse and they were different between host and parasitoid, indicating different thermal sensitivity of the two trophic levels. With a +5°C heat pulse, the adult parasitoids were larger which may result in a higher fitness, whereas a +10°C heat pulse retarded parasitoid development. These results show that the parasitoid is more sensitive than its host to brief intervals of temperature change, and this results in either positive or negative effects on life history traits, depending on the amplitude of the heat pulse. These findings suggest that more extreme fluctuations may disrupt host-parasitoid synchrony, whereas moderate fluctuations may improve parasitoid fitness."

Here, we demonstrated that the BMP type I receptor ALK-2 (encoded by the ACVR1 gene) has crucial roles in apoptosis induction of patient-derived glioma-initiating cells (GICs), TGS-01 and TGS-04. We also characterized a BMP target gene, Distal-less homeobox 2 (DLX2), and found that DLX2 promoted apoptosis and neural differentiation of GICs. The tumor-suppressive effects of ALK-2 and DLX2 were further confirmed in a mouse orthotopic transplantation model. Interestingly, valproic acid (VPA), an anti-epileptic compound, induced BMP2, BMP4, ACVR1 and DLX2 mRNA expression with a concomitant increase in phosphorylation of Smad1/5. Consistently, we showed that treatment with VPA induced apoptosis of GICs, whereas silencing of ALK-2 or DLX2 expression partially suppressed it. Our study thus reveals BMP-mediated inhibitory mechanisms for glioblastoma, which explains, at least in part, the therapeutic effects of VPA."
https://openalex.org/W2609893130,"The identification of drug target proteins (IDTP) plays a critical role in biometrics. The aim of this study was to retrieve potential drug target proteins (DTPs) from a collected protein dataset, which represents an overwhelming task of great significance. Previously reported methodologies for this task generally employ protein-protein interactive networks but neglect informative biochemical attributes. We formulated a novel framework utilizing biochemical attributes to address this problem. In the framework, a biased support vector machine (BSVM) was combined with the deep embedded representation extracted using a deep learning model, stacked auto-encoders (SAEs). In cases of non-drug target proteins (NDTPs) contaminated by DTPs, the framework is beneficial due to the efficient representation of the SAE and relief of the imbalance effect by the BSVM. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework, and the generalization capability was confirmed via comparisons to other models. This study is the first to exploit a deep learning model for IDTP. In summary, nearly 23% of the NDTPs were predicted as likely DTPs, which are awaiting further verification based on biomedical experiments."

In vitro, insulin increased proliferation of intestinal tumour epithelial cells by almost two-fold in primary culture of tumour cells from ApcMin/+ mice. Surprisingly, targeted deletion of insulin receptors in intestinal epithelial cells in ApcMin/+ mice did not change intestinal tumour number or size distribution on either a low or high-fat diet. We therefore asked whether cells in the tumour stroma might explain the association between tumour formation and insulin resistance. To this end, we generated ApcMin/+ mice with loss of insulin receptors in vascular endothelial cells. Strikingly, these mice had 42% more intestinal tumours than controls, no change in tumour angiogenesis, but increased expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in primary culture of tumour endothelial cells. Insulin decreased VCAM-1 expression and leukocyte adhesion in quiescent tumour endothelial cells with intact insulin receptors and partly prevented increases in VCAM-1 and leukocyte adhesion after treatment with tumour necrosis factor-α. Knockout of insulin receptors in endothelial cells also increased leukocyte adhesion in mesenteric venules and increased the frequency of neutrophils in tumours. We conclude that although insulin is mitogenic for intestinal tumour cells in vitro, impaired insulin action in the tumour microenvironment may be more important in conditions where hyperinsulinaemia is secondary to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance in tumour endothelial cells produces an activated, proinflammatory state that promotes tumorigenesis. Improvement of endothelial dysfunction may reduce colorectal cancer risk in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2609784270,"Endocytosis, and the subsequent trafficking of endosomes, requires dynamic physical alterations in membrane shape that are mediated in part by endophilin proteins. The endophilin B family of proteins contains an N-terminal Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (N-BAR) domain that induces membrane curvature to regulate intracellular membrane dynamics. Whereas endophilin B1 (SH3GLB1/Bif-1) is known to be involved in a number of cellular processes, including apoptosis, autophagy, and endocytosis, the cellular function of endophilin B2 (SH3GLB2) is not well understood. In this study, we used genetic approaches that revealed that endophilin B2 is not required for embryonic development in vivo but that endophilin B2 deficiency impairs endosomal trafficking in vitro, as evidenced by suppressed endosome acidification, EGFR degradation, autophagic flux, and influenza A viral RNA nuclear entry and replication. Mechanistically, although the loss of endophilin B2 did not affect endocytic internalization and lysosomal function, endophilin B2 appeared to regulate the trafficking of endocytic vesicles and autophagosomes to late endosomes or lysosomes. Moreover, we also found that despite having an intracellular localization and tissue distribution similar to endophilin B1, endophilin B2 is dispensable for mitochondrial apoptosis. Taken together, our findings suggest that endophilin B2 positively regulates the endocytic pathway in response to growth factor signaling, autophagy induction, and viral entry."
https://openalex.org/W2610112153,"Background Children who were only exposed to a mixture of chloromethylisothiazolinone (CMIT) and methylisothiazolinone (MIT) as humidifier disinfectant (HD) components were evaluated for humidifier disinfectant-associated lung injury (HDLI) from 2012. This study was to evaluate the pulmonary function using, impulse oscillometry (IOS) for children exposed to a mixture of CMIT/MIT from HD. Methods Twenty-four children who were only exposed to a mixture of CMIT/MIT, with no previous underlying disease, were assessed by IOS. Diagnostic criteria for HDLI were categorized as definite, probable, possible, or unlikely. Home visits and administration of a standardized questionnaire were arranged to assess exposure characteristics. Results Definite and probable cases showed higher airborne disinfectant exposure intensity during sleep (32.4 ± 8.7 μg/m3) and younger age at initial exposure (3.5 ± 3.3 months) compared with unlikely cases (17.3 ± 11.0 μg/m3, p = 0.026; 22.5 ± 26.2 months, p = 0.039, respectively). Reactance at 5 Hz was significantly more negative in those with high-density exposure during sleep (mean, -0.463 kPa/L/s vs. low density, -0.296, p = 0.001). The reactance area was also higher with high-density exposure during sleep (mean, 3.240 kPa/L vs. low density, 1.922, p = 0.039). The mean bronchodilator response with high-density exposure was within the normal range for reactance. Conclusions Significant peripheral airway dysfunction were found in children with high levels of inhalation exposure to a mixture of CMIT/MIT during sleep. Strict regulation of a mixture of CMIT/MIT exposure were associated with positive effects on lung function of children."

EGF is synthesized as a single 6-kDa domain within its ˜140-kDa glycosylated pro-EGF precursor (Fig. 1A), with the EGF domain separated from the single transmembrane domain by a short 10-residue spacer sequence (1Dreux A.C.

Indeed, all EGF family members are synthesized as single domains of their proproteins, although there is no conserved sequence defining the amino or carboxyl proteolytic sites that flank the growth factor domains. In general, the P1 sessile residues (cleavage occurs between the P1 and P1′ residues) in these growth factor precursors tend to be small or hydrophobic (1Dreux A.C. Lamb D.J. Modjtahedi H. Ferns G.A.

Pro-EGF differs from its family members in that the P1 residue for both the N-and C-terminal cleavage is the positively charged residue arginine (2Harris R.C. Chung E. Coffey R.J. EGF receptor ligands.Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In fact, the first purification of EGF by Cohen and co-workers in the 1960s and 1970s found both low and high-molecular-weight forms of EGF (25Taylor J.M. Cohen S. Mitchell W.M. Epidermal growth factor: high and low molecular weight forms.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1970; 67: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) along with a co-purifying arginyl esterase that was “postulated to function in the enzymatic liberation of EGF from a precursor” (26Taylor J.M. Mitchell W.M. Cohen S. Characterization of the binding protein for epidermal growth factor.J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2188-2194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of this protein remains obscure, but because platelets are the source of EGF in the circulation, then platelets or their megakaryocyte precursors should contain a protease to process pro-EGF to active growth factor whether or not it is the previously purified arginyl esterase. The reduced proteome of platelets contains just four ADAM protease family members including ADAM10 and ADAM17 (27Burkhart J.M. Vaudel M. Gambaryan S. Radau S. Walter U. Martens L. Geiger J.

Biol. 2013; 33: 1635-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suggesting that one of these four proteases hydrolyzes the sessile arginyl bonds of pro-EGF to form active cytokine. We determined how platelets store and release EGF to find that platelets do not actually store fully processed and soluble EGF but, rather, expressed the pro-EGF precursor on their surface and in granules. Activated platelets released soluble ADAMDEC1 that proteolyzed surface pro-EGF at the appropriate sessile arginyl residue in the spacer sequence to generate soluble high-molecular-weight (HMW)-EGF. HMW-EGF was an effective ligand for its EGF receptor (ErbB1, Her1) and promoted migration and invasion of untransformed head-and-neck tumor cells. Platelets are the primary source of EGF in the circulation, but how stimulated platelets release this EGF to their environment is undefined. We used density gradient centrifugation of platelet lysates and Western blotting to determine which platelet compartments contain EGF and in what form. Immunoblotting showed that platelets contained full-length pro-EGF in plasma membrane and granule fractions identified by the marker P-selectin (CD62P) (Fig. 1B). Pro-EGF is a single pass transmembrane protein, and flow cytometry confirmed immunoreactive EGF was displayed on the surface of quiescent platelets (Fig. 1C). We found unstimulated platelets released little immunoreactive EGF over time but that HMW-EGF appeared in the media after stimulation by either the weak agonist ADP, the strong agonist thrombin, or the PAR1 (the primary platelet thrombin receptor)-specific peptide agonist TRAP6 (Fig. 1D). Ultracentrifugation showed that ˜95% of the EGF released from activated platelets was soluble protein not associated with microparticles (not shown). Recombinant 6-kDa EGF itself induced release of HMW-EGF from platelets that was equivalent to that released by ADP or collagen (Fig. 1E). This experiment also shows, because 6-kDa EGF was only detected after the addition of recombinant EGF, that we could have captured and detected this small protein in platelet supernatants had it been present. Thus, stimulated platelets released only HMW-EGF, even hours after stimulation, and not fully processed EGF. We confirmed the primary EGFR agonist released from activated platelets was a high-molecular-weight protein by size exclusion filtration. We divided the material released from activated platelets into material > or <50 kDa by filtration to find that the majority of the activity released from thrombin-activated platelets was high-molecular-weight material (Fig. 1F). We also determined what portion of platelet pro-EGF was released after activation to find that stimulated platelets release only a small portion of their total pro-EGF (Fig. 1G). Platelets express EGF receptor (EGFR, not shown), and we found that thrombin-stimulated platelets released agonists to their supernatants that subsequently induced EGFR autophosphorylation in naïve platelets (Fig. 2A). Release of EGFR agonistic activity was evident by 5 min of stimulation and remained elevated by 10 min relative to material recovered from unstimulated platelets. Solubilization of EGFR agonists from pro-EGF displayed on the platelet surface over time suggests extracellular proteolysis, so we determined whether platelets released a soluble protease using a TNFα sequence suitable for screening ADAM family members (29Moss M.L. Rasmussen F.H. Fluorescent substrates for the proteinases ADAM17, ADAM10, ADAM8, and ADAM12 useful for high-throughput inhibitor screening.Anal. Biochem. 2007; 366: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We found activated platelets released hydrolytic activity(ies), which cut-off filters indicated had an apparent size between 35 and 100 kDa (not shown). We sought a way to implicate this activity in EGF solubilization by performing a high throughput screen of the Lopac library of biologically active compounds using this peptide substrate to find that chymostatin inhibited the platelet-derived peptidase (not shown). The externally disposed EGF domain in pro-EGF is separated from the transmembrane domain by a 10-residue spacer sequence (Fig. 1A), limiting the region for proteolytic solubilization. We thus synthesized a fluorogenic pro-EGF peptide centered on the physiologic Arg1023 cleavage site in pro-EGF. This peptide included the final three carboxyl residues of the EGF domain, the sessile residue Arg1023, and then the three initial residues of the spacer sequence. We included a fluorescent amino carboxylmethylfluorescein group and a carboxyl DABCYL function to internally quench peptide fluorescence. We found supernatants of activated platelets released a peptidolytic activity that hydrolyzed this fluorogenic pro-EGF peptide (Fig. 2B). This activity, like TNFα peptide hydrolysis, was not inhibited by the matrix metalloproteinase/ADAM inhibitor GM6001 even at a concentration more than twice that necessary to fully block platelet ADAM17 (TACE) (30Rabie T. Strehl A. Ludwig A. Nieswandt B. Evidence for a role of ADAM17 (TACE) in the regulation of platelet glycoprotein V.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14462-14468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We also found that chymostatin reduced release of biologically active EGF from naïve platelets that had been treated with supernatants of thrombin-activated platelets (after irreversible inactivation of thrombin) (Fig. 2A). This chymostatin inhibition of EGFR ligand release from activated platelets confirms that activation-dependent proteolysis occurs at the time of EGFR ligand release. Platelets express four ADAM protease family members including 53-kDa ADAMDEC1 (27Burkhart J.M. Vaudel M. Gambaryan S. Radau S. Walter U. Martens L. Geiger J. Sickmann A. Zahedi R.P.

We found ADAMDEC1 floated in the granule and plasma membrane fractions during density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1B), localizing with pro-EGF. Little ADAMDEC1 was released from quiescent platelets or those stimulated with the weak agonist ADP, but stimulation with thrombin led to the rapid and time-dependent release of ADAMDEC1 into the media (Fig. 3A). ADAMDEC1 was also released in response to the TRAP6 peptide, showing the PAR1 receptor alone, although less efficient than thrombin, was a sufficient stimulus to induce release of this protease. We determined whether ADAMDEC1 was an EGF sheddase by treating quiescent platelets with increasing concentrations of recombinant ADAMDEC1 and recovering solubilized material after this exposure. We found (Fig. 3B) ADAMDEC1 induced release of HMW-EGF and that the amount of HMW-EGF in the media corresponded to the level of ADAMDEC1 in the incubation.

Biol. 2013; 33: 1635-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), did not correlate to EGF release. The original purification of EGF shows it physically associates with an uncharacterized arginyl esterase (26Taylor J.M. Mitchell W.M. Cohen S. Characterization of the binding protein for epidermal growth factor.J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2188-2194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) presumed to proteolyze pro-EGF at the N- and/or C-terminal arginyl residues of the EGF domain (31Hirata Y. Orth D.N. Conversion of high molecular weight human epidermal growth factor (hEGF)/urogastrone (UG) to small molecular weight hEGF/UG by mouse EGF-associated arginine esterase.J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1979; 49: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This is an unusually strong interaction between a protease and its protein target, suggesting that other proteases hydrolyzing pro-EGF may also form a tight complex with this substrate. To test this we immunoprecipitated recombinant ADAMDEC1 after incubation with quiescent platelets. We found, by blotting the recovered proteins with anti-EGF antibody, that recombinant ADAMDEC1 co-immunoprecipitated with the HMW-EGF it solubilized from quiescent platelets (Fig. 3C). We determined whether recombinant ADAMDEC1 proteolyzed the fluorogenic pro-EGF peptide, like the activity released from stimulated platelets, to find that it did so, and that this peptidolysis also was inhibited by increasing concentrations of chymostatin (Fig. 4A). Also like the activity(ies) released from activated platelets, this hydrolysis was not inhibited by GM6001. We next determined whether ADAMDEC1 was able to act on the pro-EGF displayed on the platelet surface to generate soluble EGFR agonistic activity. To do this, we treated quiescent platelets with increasing concentrations of recombinant ADAMDEC1, cleared the cells by centrifugation, concentrated the resulting supernatants over 10-kDa cutoff filters, and then diluted this material into media overlaying HeLa EGFR reporter cells. The reporter cells were lysed after increasing amounts of time before EGFR tyrosine autophosphorylation was determined by Western blotting. This experiment showed that ADAMDEC1 solubilized EGFR agonists from resting platelets in a concentration-dependent way and that the HMW-EGF solubilized by ADAMDEC1 was an active EGFR agonist (Fig. 4B). ADAMDEC1 solubilization of active EGFR ligand, like platelet-derived activity, was sensitive to chymostatin but not the potent ADAM inhibitor GM6001 (Fig. 4C). Pro-EGF localized in at least two pools in platelets, so to determine whether exogenous ADAMDEC1 hydrolyzes plasma membrane-associated pro-EGF, we biotinylated the surface proteins of quiescent platelets. These cells were then treated with ADAMDEC1 in the presence or absence of chymostatin before recovering solubilized biotinylated proteins by streptavidin capture and then Western blotting these proteins for EGF. These data confirm that surface pro-EGF is accessible to ADAMDEC1 (Fig. 4D) and that the hydrolytic product of the externally facing pro-EGF precursor is HMW-EGF. The polypeptide arginine deiminase (PAD) released by Porphyromonas gingivalis inactivates 6-kDa EGF by metabolizing the C-terminal Arg1023 of fully processed EGF to a citrulline residue (32Pyrc K. Milewska A. Kantyka T. Sroka A. Maresz K. Kozieł J. Nguyen K.A. Enghild J.J. Knudsen A.D. Potempa J. Inactivation of epidermal growth factor by Porphyromonas gingivalis as a potential mechanism for periodontal tissue damage.Infect. Immun. 2013; 81: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This Arg1023 residue is the proposed proteolytic site in pro-EGF that yields HMW-EGF (33Le Gall S.M. Auger R. Dreux C. Mauduit P. Regulated cell surface pro-EGF ectodomain shedding is a zinc metalloprotease-dependent process.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45255-45268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and so was the central residue in the fluorogenic pro-EGF1020–1027 peptide. We, therefore, determined whether recombinant neutrophil PAD4 would target this arginyl residue in the context of the pro-EGF sequence. We found pretreating the fluorogenic peptide with increasing amounts of PAD4 inhibited and ultimately abolished subsequent ADAMDEC1 hydrolysis of the peptide (Fig. 5A). ADAMDEC1 hydrolysis of the pro-EGF peptide thus required Arg1023 and so only cleaves pro-EGF at its physiologic hydrolytic site. We determined whether arginyl residues of pro-EGF were critical for ADAMDEC1-induced release of HMW-EGF from platelets. We pretreated unstimulated platelets with recombinant PAD4 before incubation with recombinant ADAMDEC1 to find this impaired release of HMW-EGF (Fig. 5B). We then tested whether recognition of arginyl residues contributes to proteolysis of platelet pro-EGF by endogenous proteolytic activity. We pretreated quiescent platelets with recombinant PAD4 and then stimulated the cells, or not, with either a low concentration of thrombin or soluble collagen. We found PAD4 pretreatment re"

One Nellore steer fitted with a ruminal silicone-type cannula was used as a donor of ruminal contents. The experiment comprised 11 experimental groups: pellet control (PC), lyophilized control (LC), P-20: pellet stored frozen at -20°C for a period of 3, 6, and 12 months, P-80: pellet stored frozen at -80°C for a period of 3, 6, and 12 months, and L-20: lyophilized sample stored frozen at -20°C for a period of 3, 6, and 12 months. Metagenomic DNA concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically and fluorometrically and ion torrent sequencing was used to assess the bacterial community composition. The L-20 method could not maintain the yield of DNA during storage. In addition, the P-80 group showed a greater yield of metagenomic DNA than the other groups after 6 months of storage. Rumen samples stored as pellets (P-20 and P-80) resulted in lower richness Chao 1, ACE, and Shannon Wiener indices when compared to PC, while LC and PC were only different in richness ACE. The storage method and storage time influenced the proportions of 14 of 17 phyla identified by sequencing. In the P-20 group, the proportion of Cyanobacteria, Elusimicrobia, Fibrobacteres, Lentisphaerae, Proteobacteria, and Spirochaetes phyla identified was lower than 1%. In the P-80 group, there was an increase in the proportion of the Bacteroidetes phylum (p = 0.010); however, the proportion of Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, SR1, Synergistetes, TM7, and WPS.2 phyla were unchanged compared to the PC group (p > 0.05). The class Clostridium was the most abundant in all stored groups and increased in its proportion, especially in the L-20 group. The rumen sample storage time significantly reduced the yield of metagenomic DNA extracted. Therefore, the storage method can influence the abundance of phyla, classes, and bacterial families studied in rumen samples and affect the richness and diversity index."
https://openalex.org/W2610189799,"Inturned (INTU), a cilia and planar polarity effector, performs prominent ciliogenic functions during morphogenesis, such as in the skin. INTU is expressed in adult tissues but its role in tissue maintenance is unknown. Here, we report that the expression of the INTU gene is aberrantly elevated in human basal cell carcinoma (BCC), coinciding with increased primary cilia formation and activated hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Disrupting Intu in an oncogenic mutant Smo (SmoM2)-driven BCC mouse model prevented the formation of BCC through suppressing primary cilia formation and Hh signaling, suggesting that Intu performs a permissive role during BCC formation. INTU is essential for intraflagellar transport A complex assembly during ciliogenesis. To further determine whether Intu is directly involved in the activation of Hh signaling downstream of ciliogenesis, we examined the Hh signaling pathway in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which readily responds to the Hh pathway activation. Depleting Intu blocked Smo agonist-induced Hh pathway activation, whereas the expression of Gli2ΔN, a constitutively active Gli2, restored Hh pathway activation in Intu-deficient cells, suggesting that INTU functions upstream of Gli2 activation. In contrast, overexpressing Intu did not promote ciliogenesis or Hh signaling. Taken together, data obtained from this study suggest that INTU is indispensable during BCC tumorigenesis and that its aberrant upregulation is likely a prerequisite for primary cilia formation during Hh-dependent tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2610396582,"Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a highly aggressive B-cell malignancy that is closely associated with one of oncogenic viruses infection, Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. PEL prognosis is poor and patients barely survive >6 months even following active chemotherapy interventions. There is therefore an urgent need to discover more effective targets for PEL management. We recently found that the ribonucleotide reductase (RR) subunit M2 is potentially regulated by the key oncogenic hepatocyte growth factor/c-MET pathway in PEL. In this study, we set to investigate the role of RR in PEL pathogenesis and to evaluate its potential as a therapeutic target. We report that the RR inhibitor 3-AP actively induces PEL cell cycle arrest through inhibiting the activity of the nuclear factor-κB pathway. Using a xenograft model, we found that 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-AP) effectively suppresses PEL progression in immunodeficient mice. Transcriptome analysis of 3-AP-treated PEL cell lines reveals altered cellular genes, most of whose roles in PEL have not yet been reported. Taken together, we propose that RR and its signaling pathway may serve as novel actionable targets for PEL management."

Early detection of subclinical CAD by assessment of coronary artery calcium (CAC) may help risk stratify and prevent CAD events in these individuals.

Weston scores were associated with similar CAD risk factors as Agatston scores (age, race, HDL cholesterol level, all p<0.05) in our cohort. There was excellent correlation (rs = 0.92, p<0.001) and agreement (κw = 0.77, p<0.001) between Weston and Agatston scores.This study is the first to examine calcium scoring using chest CT in HIV-infected individuals and to independently validate the Weston score as a surrogate for the Agatston score.

Currently, PIASy is known to contain one SIM at the C-terminal region (4Yunus A.A. Lima C.D. Structure of the Siz/PIAS SUMO E3 ligase Siz1 and determinants required for SUMO modification of PCNA.Mol.

We report here the identification of a second SIM in PIASy, positioned between the SP-RING and the previously known SIM. NMR spectroscopy and mutational analysis revealed the significance of the new SIM in PIASy-mediated SUMO conjugation. We have previously demonstrated the crucial role of PIASy in SUMO-2/3 modification of mitotic substrates TopoIIα and PARP1 (10Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Anan T. Dasso M.

PIASy-dependent SUMOylation regulates DNA topoisomerase II activity.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our initial deletion analysis of PIASy has shown that both N- and C-terminal regions of PIASy are essential for its activity (10Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Anan T. Dasso M. PIASy mediates SUMO-2 conjugation of topoisomerase-II on mitotic chromosomes.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2172-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although we demonstrated that the N terminus is required for localization of PIASy at the mitotic centromeres (19Ryu H. Azuma Y. Rod/Zw10 complex is required for PIASy-dependent centromeric SUMOylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32576-32585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the role of the C terminus of PIASy is unclear. To evaluate the role of the C-terminal domain of PIASy in SUMOylation, we tested C-terminal deletions of PIASy (Fig. 1A) in the reconstituted in vitro SUMOylation assay (11Ryu H. Al-Ani G. Deckert K. Kirkpatrick D. Gygi S.P. Dasso M. Azuma Y. PIASy Mediates SUMO-2/3 conjugation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) on mitotic chromosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14415-14423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). At physiological concentration of the SUMOylation enzymes, PIASy N414 (a fragment lacking the 87 C-terminal residues) was inefficient in SUMOylating both TopoIIα and PARP1 (Fig. 1, B and C). The extent of SUMO conjugation using N414 was similar to the SUMOylation observed in the absence of PIASy (depicted by comparable higher shifted bands with N414 and no PIASy for both TopoIIα and PARP1; Fig. 1, B and C, last two lanes). Next, we examined a longer PIASy construct, N454, that lacked the currently known SIM (here after referred as original SIM) but retained all the components previously reported as sufficient for the ligase activity of Siz1, the PIAS homolog in yeast (4Yunus A.A.

Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35822-35828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, N454 lacking the original SIM was capable of SUMOylating both the mitotic substrates (Fig. 1, B and C) albeit at a lower efficiency compared with full-length PIASy (WT). Consistent with the previous observation in Siz1 (4Yunus A.A. Lima C.D. Structure of the Siz/PIAS SUMO E3 ligase Siz1 and determinants required for SUMO modification of PCNA.Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 669-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), inclusion of the original SIM and the flanking acidic domain (PIASy N480) further enhanced the SUMO conjugation (Fig. 1, B and C). Both PIASy N414 and N454 could recruit E2 Ubc9 through the SP-RING domain; however, only N454 stimulated in vitro SUMO conjugation as an active ligase (Fig. 1). Previous studies have revealed that efficient E3-mediated SUMO conjugation requires optimal positioning of both E2 and SUMO from the E2-SUMO thioester complex (4Yunus A.A. Lima C.D.

To determine whether the original SIM-less N454 orients the E2-SUMO complex for productive catalysis by additional stabilization of SUMO, we tested the direct binding between SUMO and the original SIM-less PIASy using NMR spectroscopy. A shorter construct, PIASy(287–454) (Fig. 2A), was more amenable for NMR studies due to better expression compared with N454 and was thus used in the NMR titrations. 15N-Labeled SUMO-3 was titrated with increasing concentrations of unlabeled PIASy(287–454) at 1:0, 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:2 molar ratios, and the titration was monitored by acquiring 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra (Fig. 2B). The stepwise addition of PIASy(287–454) resulted in peak broadening of specific resonances of SUMO-3 (Fig. 2B), indicating interaction in the intermediate exchange NMR time scale. To identify the SUMO-3 residues that were perturbed the most by PIASy(287–454), we calculated the peak intensity ratio (I1:1/I1:0) for each non-overlapped SUMO-3 peak at a SUMO-3:PIASy(287–454) molar ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 2C). Residues displaying significant peak intensity reduction (average intensity minus the standard deviation) included Ser-27, Gln-30, Phe-31, Lys-41, Leu-42, Ala-45, Tyr-46, Asp-62, Glu-78, and Thr-82. The affected residues were mapped onto the structure of SUMO-3 (Fig. 2D). Surprisingly, even though PIASy(287–454) lacks the original SIM, the majority of the affected residues clustered together spatially in the β2-strand and α1-helix of SUMO-3, which have been well characterized as the binding surface for the SIM on SUMO (6Song J.

Furthermore, results of a fluorescence polarization binding assay using SUMO-3 labeled with fluorescein maleimide and PIASy(287–454) showed an apparent Kd of 81 μm (Fig. 2E). The value obtained is consistent with the observed intermediate exchange NMR behavior and previously reported dissociation constants for other SUMO-SIM interactions, which are in the 1–120 μm range (6Song J.

We also titrated a longer construct containing the original SIM, PIASy(287–501), into 15N-labeled SUMO-3 (Fig. 3A). As expected, incorporation of the original SIM and the acidic domain resulted in more pronounced chemical shift perturbations when compared with results of the NMR titrations using the shorter PIASy(287–454) (Fig. 3B). Stepwise addition of PIASy(287–501) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in intensities of SUMO-3 peaks. Some SUMO-3 residues showed changes in peak positions in addition to reduced peak intensities (e.g. Arg-35, Lys-41, Tyr-46, and Asn-67), and several peaks broadened beyond detection (Fig. 3B). Although most SUMO-3 residues showed some degree of line broadening from the beginning of the titration, which is not uncommon with the formation of a high molecular mass complex (SUMO-3, 13 kDa; PIASy(287–501), 28 kDa) slowing down the tumbling rate (23Williamson M.P. Using chemical shift perturbation to characterise ligand binding.Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2013; 73: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), specific residues were more affected than the others as illustrated by a peak intensity ratio graph (Fig. 3C). The SUMO-3 residues strongly affected by PIASy(287–501) were identical to the residues affected by PIASy(287–454) and mapped to the β2-strand and α1-helix, which form the SIM-binding surface on the SUMO (Fig. 3D). NMR titrations of 15N-labeled SUMO-3 with PIASy(287–454), which lacked the original SIM (Fig. 2), also perturbed the same SUMO-3 residues that a SIM peptide would, suggesting that an additional SIM may be present within the PIASy(287–454) fragment. Furthermore, a SIM prediction web server (24Zhao Q. Xie Y. Zheng Y. Jiang S. Liu W. Mu W. Liu Z. Zhao Y. Xue Y. Ren J. GPS-SUMO: a tool for the prediction of sumoylation sites and SUMO-interaction motifs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: W325-W330Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) suggested that there is a high probability that the PIASy(287–454) fragment contains a SIM (herein termed as new SIM) within residues 417–435 (Fig. 4A). The new SIM harbors a conserved hydrophobic core with the sequence “ILVL” from amphibian to mammalian PIASy and “VVDI” in fish PIASy and is preceded by a few acidic and serine residues, which are potential sites for phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). These features of the new SIM are similar to the characteristic known SIM sequences that bind SUMO in antiparallel orientation (9Cappadocia L. Pichler A. Lima C.D.

(The acidic stretch in PIAS proteins varies from 5 to 7 residues, but the acidic stretch in PIASy is exceptionally long with 17 residues following the known SIM.) To confirm the role of the new SIM in SUMO binding, we subcloned and expressed a 45-residue peptide encompassing the PIASy region containing the new SIM fragment (PIASy(409–454) WT; Fig. 4A). We also mutated the three critical ILV hydrophobic residues of the new SIM into triple alanines (PIASy(409–454) mut; Fig. 4A). Both WT and mut PIASy(409–454) sho"
https://openalex.org/W2608498379,"The family Sciaenidae, known as croakers or drums, is one of the largest perciform fish families. A recent multi-gene based study investigating the phylogeny and biogeography of global sciaenids revealed that the origin and early diversification of this family occurred in tropical America during the Late Oligocene-Early Miocene before undergoing range expansions to other seas including the Indo-West Pacific, where high species richness is observed. Despite this clarification of the overall evolutionary history of the family, knowledge of the taxonomy and phylogeny of sciaenid genera endemic to the Indo-West Pacific is still limited due to lack of a thorough survey of all taxa. In this study, we used DNA-based approaches to investigate the evolutionary relationships, to explore the species diversity, and to elucidate the taxonomic status of sciaenid species/genera within the Indo-West Pacific clade. Three datasets were herein built for the above objectives: the combined dataset (248 samples from 45 currently recognized species) from one nuclear gene (RAG1) and one mitochondrial gene (COI); the dataset with only RAG1 gene sequences (245 samples from 44 currently recognized species); and the dataset with only COI gene sequences (308 samples from 51 currently recognized species). The latter was primarily used for our biodiversity exploration with two different species delimitation methods (Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery, ABGD and Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent, GMYC). The results were further evaluated with help of four supplementary criteria for species delimitation (genetic similarity, monophyly inferred from individual gene and combined data trees, geographic distribution, and morphology). Our final results confirmed the validity of 32 currently recognized species and identified several potential new species waiting for formal descriptions. We also reexamined the taxonomic status of the genera, Larimichthys, Nibea, Protonibea and Megalonibea, and suggested a revision of Nibea and proposed a new genus Pseudolarimichthys."
https://openalex.org/W2609828286,"Introduction The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is validated for parents, but not yet for teachers in a broad age range of children. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 4–10 years old school children to investigate if the SDQ-T can be used instead of the validated but lengthy Teacher’s Report Form (TRF) to acquire information about emotional and behavioral problems in the school community. Methods Teachers of 453 children from primary schools were approached. Teachers of 394 children (response rate 86.9%) with a mean age of 7.1 years filled in the SDQ-T (n = 387), the TRF (n = 349) or both (n = 342). We assessed reliability by calculating internal consistency and concurrent validity (using correlation coefficients, sensitivity, specificity) of the SDQ-T compared with the TRF. Results Internal consistency of the SDQ-T Total Difficulties Score (SDQ-T TDS; Cronbach α = 0.80), hyperactivity/ inattention- (α = 0.86) and prosocial behavior (α = 0.81) was very good. Concurrent validity demonstrated a strong correlation of all subscales of the SDQ-T with the corresponding scale on the TRF (range 0.54–0.73), except for peer problems (0.46). Using a SDQ-T TDS cut-off score > 14, the SDQ-T had a good sensitivity (90%) and specificity (94%). Discussion The good reliability, validity and brevity of the SDQ-T make it an easily applicable questionnaire for obtaining information about emotional and behavioral problems from teachers in primary school children."
https://openalex.org/W2607524498,"Long-term nitroglycerin (NTG) therapy causes tolerance to its effects attributing to increased oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Shenmai injection (SMI), which is clinically used to treat cardiovascular diseases, consists of two herbal medicines, Ginseng Rubra and Ophiopogonjaponicas, and is reported to have antioxidant effects. The present study was designed to investigate the potential preventive effects of Shenmai injection on development of nitroglycerin-induced tolerance. The present study involves both in vivo and in vitro experiments to investigate nitroglycerin-induced tolerance. We examined the effect of Shenmai injection on the cardiovascular oxidative stress by measuring the serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Endothelial dysfunction was determined by an endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation method in aortic rings and NOS activity. Inhibition of the cGMP/cGK-I signalling pathway was determined from released serum levels of cGMP and the protein expression levels of sGC, cGK-I, PDE1A and P-VASP by western blot. Here, we showed that SMI ameliorated the decrease in AV Peak Vel, the attenuation in the vasodilation response to nitroglycerin and endothelial dysfunction. SMI also reduced the cardiovascular oxidative stress by reducing the release of MDA and increasing the activity of SOD. Shenmai injection further ameliorated inhibition of the cGMP/cGK-I signalling pathway triggered by nitroglycerin-induced tolerance through up-regulating the protein expression of sGC, cGK-I, and P-VASP and down- regulating the proteins expression of PDE1A. In vitro studies showed that Shenmai injection could recover the attenuated vasodilation response to nitroglycerin following incubation (of aortic rings) with nitroglycerin via activating the enzymes of sGC and cGK-I. Therefore, we conclude that Shenmai injection could prevent NTG nitroglycerin-induced tolerance at least in part by decreasing the cardiovascular oxidative stress, meliorating the endothelial dysfunction and ameliorating the inhibition of the cGMP/cGK-I signalling pathway. These findings indicate the potential of Shenmai injection (SMI) as a promising medicine for preventing the development of nitroglycerin-induced tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2610749037,"Phylogenetic trees are the de facto standard for visualizing evolutionary relationships, but large trees can be difficult to interpret because they require a high cognitive load to identify relationships between multiple operational taxonomic units (OTUs). We present a new tool for displaying phylogenetic relationships as a topographic map in which OTUs autonomously attract or repel one another based on their individual branch lengths and distance to a common ancestor. This data visualization paradigm makes it possible to preattentively identify the nature of the relationship between items without having to trace a complex network of branches back to the root. This tool was developed for exploring phylogenetic data, but the technique could be extended for visualizing other hierarchical structures as well."
