https://openalex.org/W2037164528,"The mating type of yeast is determined by the allele, either a or alpha, at the MAT locus. Two other loci, HML and HMR, contain complete copies of the alpha and a genes, respectively, which are not expressed. The four SIR gene products are required in trans for repression of the silent loci, as are cis-acting sites on either side of HML and HMR, about 1000 bp from the mating-type promoters. We demonstrate that one of these cis-acting sequences, HMRE, is able to switch off at least two nonmating-type promoters. In common with enhancers, it is able to function in either orientation, relatively independently of its position with respect to the regulated promoter, and can act on promoters 2600 bp away. However since HMRE represses, rather than enhances, transcription we have called it a ""silencer"" sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2084832908,"We have identified a new family of ras genes, the rho genes, which share several properties with the more classical ras gene family consisting of N-, K-, and H-ras. The rho genes, first isolated from a cDNA library from the abdominal ganglia of Aplysia, encode proteins that share 35% amino acid homology with H-ras. Evolutionarily conserved counterparts of rho have been detected in yeast, in Drosophila, in rat, and in man. Sequence analysis reveals over 85% homology between the human and Aplysia proteins. The ras and rho gene products share several common properties; both are 21,000 daltons, both reveal C-terminal sequences required for membrane attachment, and both show blocks of strong internal homology, suggesting that the two proteins may share common functions but may use these functions in different ways."
https://openalex.org/W2093393945,"We have shown that lariat formation during in vitro splicing of several RNA precursors, from Drosophila to man, occurs at a unique and identifiable but weakly conserved site, 18 to 37 nucleotides proximal to the 3' splice site. Lariat formation within an artificial intron lacking a normal branch-point sequence occurs at a cryptic site a conserved distance (approximately 23 nucleotides) from the 3' splice site. Analysis of beta-thalassemia splicing mutations revealed that lariat formation in the first intron of the human beta-globin gene occurs at the same site in normal and mutant precursors, even though alternate 5' and 3' splice sites are utilized in the mutants. Remarkably, cleavage at the 5' splice site and lariat formation do not occur when the precursor contains a beta-thalassemia deletion removing the polypyrimidine stretch and AG dinucleotide at the 3' splice site. In contrast, a single base substitution in the AG dinucleotide blocks cleavage at the 3' splice site but not at the 5' site."

https://openalex.org/W2011804485,"Maturation promoting factor (MPF) has been shown to induce meiosis or mitosis when injected into Xenopus oocytes and embryos. We show here that early events of mitosis, chromatin condensation and nuclear envelope breakdown, are induced by MPF in somatic interphase nuclei incubated in a cell-free extract of Xenopus eggs. These events occur rapidly and synchronously in response to MPF and are reversed when MPF activity is diminished. Using this cell-free system, we show that major structural proteins of the nuclear lamina, lamins A and C, are hyperphosphorylated within 15 min after addition of MPF, followed by a gradual depolymerization of the nuclear lamina until the nuclear envelope breaks down 30 min later. These results show that MPF induces mitotic events in vitro, and that phosphorylation of the lamins precedes disassembly of the nuclear lamina and could act to trigger nuclear envelope breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W1564822583,"Abstract The amino acid sequence of the heavy chain of human alpha-factor XIIa (activated Hageman factor) was determined by automated Edman degradation using the peptides produced by chemical and enzymatic cleavages of intact XII and alpha-factor XIIa. Combining this sequence with the previously determined sequence of beta-factor XIIa (Fujikawa, K., and McMullen, B. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10924-10933), the complete amino acid sequence of human XII has been established. The heavy chain of alpha-factor XIIa is composed of 353 amino acid residues containing one Asn-linked and six probable O-linked carbohydrate chains. The heavy chain of alpha-factor XIIa appears to contain four different domains including a kringle, a growth factor domain, and the type I and type II domains of fibronectin. The domain organization of XII is analogous to those of several fibrinolytic proteins, including tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase, suggesting that XII belongs to the same protease subfamily as these two proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2012550276,"The cell type-specific expression of the major nuclear lamina polypeptides (“lamins”) during development of Xenopus was studied using two monoclonal antibodies (L046F7: specific for LIII, the single lamin of oocytes; PKB8: specific for LI and LII of some somatic cells). In the oocyte, LIII localizes in the nuclear polymer, but upon nuclear envelope breakdown it is solubilized to a form sedimenting at 9 S. In early embryos, LIII contributes to nuclear lamina formation until its depletion. Correspondingly, LI and LIII begin to be expressed at a specific point in embryogenesis and appear to be integrated with LIII into a common lamina structure. Later in development, LIII reappears as a prominent nuclear lamina protein but only in certain cells (neurons, muscle cells, and diplotene oocytes). We conclude that amphibian lamins represent a family of proteins expressed in relation to certain programs of cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2053886723,"The CUP1 gene of yeast encodes a small, metallothionein-like protein that binds to and is inducible by copper. A gene replacement experiment shows that this protein protects cells against copper poisoning but is dispensable for normal cellular growth and development throughout the yeast life cycle. The transcription of CUP1 is negatively autoregulated. This feedback mechanism, which is mediated through upstream control sequences, may play an important role in heavy metal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2070102173,"A hydrophobic sequence of 23 contiguous, uncharged residues anchors the coliphage f1 gene III protein (pIII) to the Escherichia coil cytoplasmic membrane; mutations removing this domain allow secretion of the protein to the periplasm. Multiple copies of an oligonucleotide encoding the hydrophobic repeat, Leu-Ala-Leu-Val, were introduced into genes for secreted forms of pIII. Artificial domains of 16 or more hydrophobic residues function to anchor the protein. Pronase protection experiments demonstrate that the new sequences act to halt transfer of the protein across the membrane, thus specifying a transmembrane topology. Relocating the hydrophobic domain within the polypeptide chain predictably alters the resultant protein/membrane topology. Repeats of a polar sequence were inserted with no effect on secretion. Furthermore, an unrelated hydrophobic sequence, uncovered by a gene III frameshift mutation, acts to anchor the protein. We conclude that function simply reflects hydrophobicity and not some more subtle feature of structure or sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2069957134,"Chi sites enhance in their vicinity homologous recombination by the E. coli RecBC pathway. We report here that RecBC enzyme catalyzes Chi-dependent cleavage of one DNA strand, that containing the Chi sequence 5'G-C-T-G-G-T-G-G3'. Chi-specific cleavage is greatly reduced by single base pair changes within the Chi sequence and by mutations within the E. coli recC gene, coding for a RecBC enzyme subunit. Although cleavage occurs preferentially with double-stranded DNA, the product of the reaction is single-stranded DNA. These results demonstrate the direct interaction of RecBC enzyme with Chi sites that was inferred from the genetic properties of Chi and recBC, and they support models of recombination in which Chi acts before the initiation of strand exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2021279906,"Homologous recombination by the E. coli RecBC pathway occurs at elevated frequency near Chi sites. We reported previously that Chi induces RecBC enzyme to cleave one DNA strand--that containing the Chi sequence 5'G-C-T-G-G-T-G-G3'. We report here that the Chi-dependent cleavage occurs four, five, or six nucleotides to the 3' side of the Chi octamer and produces nicks with 3'-OH and 5'-PO4 groups. Chi-dependent cleavage occurs if RecBC enzyme approaches the Chi sequence from the right, but not if it approaches only from the left, during unwinding of the duplex DNA substrate. A single RecBC enzyme molecule appears to cleave the DNA and to release part of it as a single-stranded fragment. These and previous results indicate that Chi-dependent cleavage is concomitant with DNA unwinding by RecBC enzyme and provide an enzymatic basis for the orientation-dependence of Chi recombinational hotspot activity. These observations demonstrate a key step of a proposed model of recombination in which RecBC enzyme produces a potentially invasive single-stranded DNA tail extending from Chi to its left. We discuss the relation between the action of Chi sites and that of special sites enhancing eukaryotic recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2124605498,"A simple kinetic model for mRNA splicing predicts the way in which in vivo steady state precursor RNA levels (P) and messenger RNA levels (M) vary as a function of the rate constant of the splicing reaction (ksp). The model points to M/P as the best measure of ksp. The analysis of a set of intron mutations in a yeast gene supports the general features of the model and shows that the splicing efficiency of transcripts containing the wild-type intron is well in excess of what is necessary to generate normal mRNA levels. The data also suggest that regions of the intron, in addition to the well-conserved consensus sequences, contribute to efficient splicing."

https://openalex.org/W1575935179,"The Escherichia coli dnaJ gene was originally discovered because mutations in it blocked bacteriophage lambda DNA replication. Some of these mutations were subsequently shown to interfere with bacterial growth at high temperature, suggesting that dnaJ is an essential protein for the host as well. The first step in purifying the dnaJ protein was to overproduce it at least 50-fold by subcloning its gene into the pMOB45 runaway plasmid. The second step was the development of an in vitro system to assay for its activity. A Fraction II extract from dnaJ259 mutant bacteria was shown to be unable to replicate lambda dv DNA unless supplemented with an exogenous source of wild-type dnaJ protein. Using this complementation assay we purified the dnaJ protein to homogeneity from the membrane fraction of an overproducing strain of bacteria. The purified dnaJ protein was shown to be a basic (pI 8.5), yet hydrophobic, protein of Mr 37,000 and 76,000 under denaturing and native conditions, respectively, and to exhibit affinity for both single- and double-stranded DNA. Using a partially purified lambda dv replication system dependent on the presence of the lambda O and P initiator proteins and at least the host dnaB, dnaG, dnaJ, dnaK, single-stranded DNA-binding protein, gyrase, RNA polymerase holoenzyme, and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, we have shown that the dnaJ protein is required at a very early step in the DNA replication process."
https://openalex.org/W1529554110,"One to 2 h after transfer of HeLa cells into fresh serum-containing medium, when translation rates are maximal, the initiation factor proteins were examined on immunoblots of two-dimensional gels. Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2 alpha, eIF-2 beta, and eIF-4A each formed a single immunoreactive spot; eIF-2 gamma formed 2 spots; and eIF-4B formed a complex array of 12-20 spots. After 4 days of growth in unreplenished medium, when translation rates have dropped 4-6-fold, several alterations in the isoelectric forms were observed: eIF-2 alpha now occurred in 2 forms, eIF-2 beta was present in 3-4 forms, and the most acidic cluster of eIF-4B variants was decreased or absent while a new isoelectric variant appeared at the basic end of the array. No changes were observed for eIF-2 gamma or eIF-4A. The 35-50-kDa subunits of the multiprotein initiation factor eIF-3 also showed no changes when the aforementioned growth states were compared. Resolution of 32P-labeled lysates by isoelectric focusing/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the eIF-2 alpha modification and the loss of eIF-4B variants reflected changes in phosphorylation states. Stimulation of 4-day grown cells with fresh serum-containing medium caused a reversal of the initiation factor modifications back to the forms prevailing shortly after replating. This analysis indicates that covalent modifications appear concurrently with decreasing initiation rates and suggests that they may be causative."
https://openalex.org/W1482401645,"The 195-kDa merozoite protein synthesized in schizonts of Plasmodium falciparum (Holder, A. A., and Freeman, R. R. (1982) J. Exp. Med. 156, 1528-1538) contains ester-linked fatty acid. Enzymatic treatment of the purified acylated protein established that the lipid is present as sn-1,2-diacyl glycerol, most probably linked to a phosphodiester at the 3-position of glycerol. The phosphodiglyceride is not directly esterified to an amino acid residue on the polypeptide backbone. The 195-kDa protein is processed to three fragments (83, 42, and 19 kDa) on the surface of free merozoites (Holder, A. A., and Freeman, R. R. (1984) J. Exp. Med. 160, 624-629), of which only the 42-kDa polypeptide is acylated."
https://openalex.org/W1535687882,"An F-actin-bundling protein with Mr of 55,000 has been purified from HeLa cells by a simple method using its affinity to F-actin. Briefly, muscle actin was mixed with supernatants of HeLa cell homogenates, and the resultant actin gel was precipitated by low speed centrifugation. The 55-kDa protein in the actin gel was dissociated by depolymerization of F-actin and purified sequentially by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite. The Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient of the 55-kDa protein were 32 A and 4.35 (S20,w), respectively. These results suggest that the 55-kDa protein is a monomeric globular protein with a native molecular weight of 57,000. The globular form of the protein was confirmed by electron microscopy of rotary shadowed specimens. The binding of the protein to actin was saturated at an approximate stoichiometry of 4 actin monomers to one 55-kDa molecule. The protein made F-actin aggregate side-by-side into bundles as has been reported for other F-actin-bundling proteins such as fimbrin (Mr = 68,000) and fascin (Mr = 58,000). The 55-kDa protein is a new actin-binding protein based on biochemical, morphological, and immunological characterization. Skeletal muscle tropomyosin inhibited the actin-bundling activity of 55-kDa protein by competitive binding to actin, suggesting that the 55-kDa protein binding site on F-actin is in the vicinity of the tropomyosin-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1606286273,"An immunoaffinity chromatographic procedure was developed to purify DNA polymerase-DNA primase complex from crude soluble extracts of yeast cells. The immunoabsorbent column is made of mouse monoclonal antibody to yeast DNA polymerase I covalently linked to Protein A-Sepharose. Purification of the complex involves binding of the complex to the immunoabsorbent column and elution with concentrated MgCl2 solutions. After rebinding to the monoclonal antibody column free primase activity is selectively eluted with a lower concentration of MgCl2. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate showed the presence of five major peptides, p180, p140, p74, p58, and p48 in the immunoaffinity-purified DNA polymerase-DNA primase complex. Free primase and free polymerase fractions obtained by fractionation on the immunoabsorbent column were analyzed on activity gels and immunoblots. These analyses showed that p180 and p140 are DNA polymerase peptides. Two polypeptides of 58 and 48 kDa co-fractionated with the free yeast DNA primase. From sucrose gradient analysis we estimate a molecular weight of 110 kDa for the native DNA primase."
https://openalex.org/W1565811769,"The adult hookworm Ancylostoma caninum releases a proteolytic enzyme which is thought to be essential for its adaption to parasitism. The protease was purified from parasite extracts by ion-exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The purified enzyme exhibited a molecular weight of 37,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and had an NH2-terminal sequence of Arg-His-His-Gln-Pro-Lys-Val-Ala-Leu-Leu-Gly-Ala-His-Gly-Gly-Ile. Using 125I-fibrin as substrate, the enzyme displayed optimal activity at pH 9-11 and was inactivated by dialysis against EDTA. The enzyme degraded [3H]elastin and both elastin and trypsin-labile glycoproteins in a rat vascular smooth muscle extracellular matrix. Antiserum raised to the protease in rabbits cross-reacted with extracts from the infective larval stage of A. caninum, suggesting that the production of the enzyme begins in an earlier developmental stage of the parasite life cycle. The role of the protease in the histolytic and anticlotting processes of the hookworm and its importance in immunity to ancylostomiasis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1651995608,"The amino acid sequence around the sites of attachment of all the bilin prosthetic groups of Gastroclonium coulteri R-phycoerythrin, (alpha beta)6 gamma, have been determined. The sequences of tryptic peptides derived from the alpha and beta subunits are (Formula: see text) where the designations alpha and beta refer to the subunits from which the peptides derived. Cysteinyl residues involved in bilin attachment are indicated with an asterisk. Each peptide carries a single bilin, either phycoerythrobilin (PEB) or phycourobilin (PUB). Spectroscopic studies on the gamma subunit indicate the presence of one PEB and three PUB groups. However, five unique tryptic peptides, gamma-A through gamma-E, were characterized, indicating that Gastroclonium R-phycoerythrin is a mixture of at least two species, (alpha beta)6 gamma and (alpha beta)6 gamma', with gamma subunits differing in amino acid sequence. The sequences of the gamma subunit bilin peptides (see below) were not homologous to those from alpha and beta subunits of any biliprotein. (Formula: see text) The bilins in all these peptides are attached through single linkages to a cysteinyl residue, except for the phycourobilin on peptide beta-3 which is attached through two thioether linkages to cysteinyl residues 10 amino acids apart. The availability of small bilin peptides was exploited to obtain more accurate molar extinction coefficients for peptide-linked PEB and PUB groups. Application of these extinction coefficients in the calculation of the bilin content of R-, B-, and C-phycoerythrins shows that there are 5 bilins/alpha beta in each of these three biliprotein types."
https://openalex.org/W1547438680,"RNase T, a nuclease thought to be involved in end-turnover of tRNA, has been purified about 4,000-fold from extracts of Escherichia coli. At this stage of purification, the enzyme was judged to be at least 95% pure based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The native molecular weight of RNase T determined from gel filtration and sedimentation analyses is about 50,000, whereas the monomer molecular weight determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is 25,000, suggesting that the protein is an alpha 2 dimer. Purified RNase T is extremely sensitive to inactivation by oxidation, sulfhydryl group reagents, and temperature. The ribonuclease activity against tRNA-C-C-[14C]A is optimal at pH 8-9 in the presence of 2-5 mM MgCl2 and ionic strengths of less than 50mM. Although RNase T is highly specific for intact tRNA-C-C-A as a substrate and can hydrolyze all species in a mixed population of tRNA, it is inhibited by other RNAs, such as poly(A), rRNA, 5 S RNA, and tRNA-C-C. RNase T is an exoribonuclease which initiates attack at a free 3' terminus of tRNA and releases AMP; aminoacyl-tRNA is not a substrate. The role of RNase T in the end-turnover of tRNA and its possible involvement in other aspects of RNA metabolism are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1520403560,"We have determined the size of the functional unit of bovine lipoprotein lipase by radiation inactivation. This was done in five different situations: 1) in a buffer with high salt concentration. In this situation the enzyme is relatively soluble and stable. 2) For an enzyme-heparin complex. This may reflect the physiological state of the enzyme at the vascular endothelium, where it is believed to be bound to a heparin-like molecule. 3) In the presence of lipid substrate and 4) with lipid substrate and activator protein. Here most of the enzyme is adsorbed to the substrate droplets. 5) For an enzyme-detergent complex; another model for enzyme-lipid interaction. In all five situations the enzyme activity decayed as an exponential function of radiation dose, and the target sizes were similar. The target size did not vary with the concentration of lipase protein. The combined data for bovine lipoprotein lipase yield a functional size of 72 kDa which is close to that expected for a dimer, 77 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W1603842801,"Insulin receptor was purified 10,000-fold from cultured mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes in 35% overall yield. The specific activities of 125I-insulin binding and autophosphorylation increased in parallel, following the initial Triton X-100 extraction of membranes. The isolation protocol, performed entirely at pH 8.45, entailed adsorption by avidin-Sepharose CL-4B of a complex formed between Triton X-100-solubilized insulin receptor and N alpha B1-(biotinyl-epsilon-aminocaproyl)insulin, and the specific elution of the complex with biotin. The avidin-Sepharose CL-4B was a partially denatured preparation, showing estimated dissociation constants of 0.2 microM for biotin and approximately 1 microM for the bifunctional ligand at, pH 7, 4 degrees C. The bifunctional ligand was characterized by 70% competency in binding to avidin, 100% competency in binding to solubilized insulin receptor, full stimulation of autophosphorylation of the isolated receptor, and maximal stimulation of hexose uptake by intact 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The insulin binding properties of the insulin receptor were uniform throughout this purification procedure. At pH 8.45, 4 degrees C, an average Kd = 0.72 nM was determined for a single class of noninteracting insulin binding sites. The apparent autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit was also unchanged following affinity chromatography. A single oligomeric structure was established for the purified receptor, composed only of 135,000- and 95,000-Da subunits, whose association was lost by denaturation in the presence of reducing agent. This single structure occurred in the initial Triton X-100 extract. The purified insulin receptor was capable of autophosphorylating the beta-subunit and catalyzed phosphorylation of protein substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1596608955,"Full time course studies of the kinetic activity of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase show that there is an increase in activity with time. The half-time for this hysteretic behavior is about 9 s. Preincubation of the enzyme with either of the substrates abolishes the lag and results in initial velocities which are 2-2.3-fold faster than those observed for the non-preincubated enzyme. The kinetic properties of the activated and nonactivated forms of the enzyme appear to be similar as measured by the full time course of the reaction. The results are consistent with observations for NADPH binding studies that the enzyme exists in two interconvertible forms, one of which is incapable of binding NADPH (Cayley, P. J., Dunn, S. M. J., and King, R. W. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 874-879)."
https://openalex.org/W1594151215,"Inorganic vanadate (Vi) activates catalysis by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase of the oxidation of glucose by NADP+. As the concentration of Glu-6-P dehydrogenase is increased, the rate of the vanadate-activated glucose oxidation becomes less sensitive to increases in enzyme concentration. The rate of glucose oxidation in the absence of Vi increases linearly with Glu-6-P dehydrogenase concentration. These results are interpreted in terms of nonenzymic formation of glucose 6-vanadate. At high enzyme concentration, vanadate ester formation becomes partially rate-limiting, and extrapolation to infinite Glu-6-P dehydrogenase concentration allows determination of the second order rate constant for formation of the ester. In separate experiments designed to test the proposed mechanism, it was found that Vi, at concentrations at which it strongly activates catalysis by Glu-6-P dehydrogenase of glucose oxidation, has no effect on the rates of oxidation of glucose 6-phosphate or 6-deoxyglucose catalyzed by Glu-6-P dehydrogenase. Sulfate, which is known to activate glucose oxidation and to inhibit glucose 6-phosphate oxidation, strongly activates 6-deoxyglucose oxidation. These experiments show that the 6-hydroxyl group of glucose is essential for the observed activation by Vi and are also consistent with the formation of glucose 6-vanadate. Also, the rate of the sulfate-activated glucose oxidation increases linearly with Glu-6-P dehydrogenase concentration. These results are consistent with the proposed mechanism for sulfate activation which involves sulfate binding to the enzyme (Anderson, W. B., Horne, R. N., and Nordlie, R. C. (1968) Biochemistry 7, 3997-4004). The second order rate constant calculated for formation of glucose 6-vanadate at pH 7.0 is 2.4 M-1 s-1. The corresponding values for glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 6-arsenate formation are approximately 9 X 10(-11) M-1 s-1 and 6.3 X 10(-6) M-1 s-1 (Lagunas, R. (1980) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 205, 67-75)."
https://openalex.org/W1671915581,"Brush-border membranes were isolated from the mucosal surface of rabbit proximal colon epithelial cells by a procedure involving Ca2+ precipitation. Ouabain-insensitive K+-phosphatase, a marker enzyme for the colon brush-border membrane, was enriched 17-fold by this technique, while no enrichment was observed in the activity of ouabain-sensitive K+-phosphatase, a marker for the basal-lateral membrane. Insulin binding studies revealed a dose-dependent inhibition of 125I-insulin binding with porcine insulin and approximately 4 X 10(-9) M insulin was required to produce 50% inhibition of 125I-insulin binding, while desoctapeptide insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, and A chain of insulin had less effect on 125I-insulin binding. This is the first demonstration of the existence of high-affinity insulin binding sites on the brush-border membrane of mammalian colon epithelial cells. Subsequent studies with the cross-linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate confirmed the presence of insulin binding sites in these membranes and autoradiography of polyacrylamide gels revealed that the binding subunit of the colon epithelial cell brush-border insulin receptor is similar in size to that observed in hepatic tissue. Interestingly, the insulin binding capacity/mg of protein of this preparation is high, suggesting that large numbers of insulin receptors are present in vivo on the mucosal surface of colon epithelial cells. The potential physiological role of these previously unrecognized insulin receptors is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1555507143,"The bovine genome contains a gene family of interferon-alpha s (bIFN-alpha) that consists of at least five distinct members. Four of the bIFN-alpha genes isolated show a high degree of homology (97% in the nucleotide sequence and 93% in amino acid sequence). The overall homology in amino acid sequence of bIFN-alpha to human, murine, and rat IFNs-alpha is approximately 60%. Yet there are amino acid clusters (positions 28-41 and 118-146) which are highly conserved throughout the mammalian evolution and in which the overall homology can be as high as 86%. Within the C terminus conserved cluster there is a sequence containing 9 amino acids completely conserved in 16 mammalian IFNs-alpha and of these, 7 are also shared with a similar domain in some bacterial toxins, implying a common functional role for these domains. One of the genes, IFN-alpha C, was expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified bacterial IFN (specific activity, 2 X 10(8) units/mg) exhibited antiviral activity on bovine cells but no detectable activity was demonstrated on human and simian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1579135337,"A large-scale purification of the progesterone receptor from laying hens is described which yields apparently homogeneous form A and form B receptor in denatured form. The purification procedure is based initially on differential DNA affinity chromatography of both form A and B receptors. Under the conditions of preparation and activation described, progesterone receptor form B binds to DNA-cellulose even in the presence of 100 mM salt. This binding cannot be observed after thermal activation. Receptors obtained at 5% purity using conventional chromatographic purification steps were covalently cross-linked with radioactive ligand by photoaffinity labeling and purified to homogeneity using preparative gel electrophoresis systems under denaturing conditions. This material has been successfully used to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Immunoblots demonstrated a high degree of cross-reaction between anti-A antibodies and progesterone receptor form B, as well as between anti-B antibodies and progesterone receptor form A, using homogeneous as well as 5% pure receptors as probes. Implications of the immunological data and the novel DNA-binding characteristics of form B are discussed with respect to topological conformation of the progesterone receptor and the structural similarity between forms A and B."
https://openalex.org/W1546815914,"Cytosol extracts high in insulin-degrading activity were cross-linked to 125I-insulin with the bifunctional cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate. With cytosols from either rat muscle, liver, kidney or brain or human erythrocytes, only a single protein (Mr = 110,000) was specifically labeled. Three different lines of evidence indicated that this labeled protein is insulin-degrading enzyme, a cysteine protease which accounts for most of the insulin-degrading activity in cell extracts. Firstly, the cross-linking of 125I-insulin to this protein is inhibited by unlabeled insulin over the same concentration range of insulin which inhibits degradation. Separated insulin A and B chain were less potent at inhibiting cross-linking, whereas bovine serum albumin and cytochrome c were without effect. Secondly, antibodies to purified insulin-degrading enzyme precipitated the labeled protein in parallel with their ability to precipitate the insulin-degrading activity of the extracts. Thirdly, when the insulin-degrading activity was purified 40,000-fold from erythrocytes, this Mr 110,000 protein co-purified. These results indicate that cross-linking 125I-insulin may be a convenient method for labeling the insulin-degrading enzyme."

One of them, named sarcocystatin A, was purified and found to be a mixture of the components sarcocystatin A alpha and A beta in a molar ratio of 2:1. These components can exist in either the associated or dissociated form. The apparent heterogeneity of the protease inhibitors in the hemolymph was found to be partly due to association of sarcocystatin A alpha and A beta."
https://openalex.org/W1591079328,"The energetics of ammonium ion transport by Escherichia coli have been studied using [14C]methylammonium as a substrate. Rapid assays for uptake allowed kinetic parameters (CH3NH3+ Km = 36 microM; Vmax = 4 nmol X s-1 X mg-1 to be determined in the absence of CH3NH3+ metabolism. Cells cultured in media containing 1 mM NH4+ failed to express CH3NH3+ transport activity. Methylammonium accumulated at levels which were 100-fold higher than those of the medium. This accumulation was dependent upon the addition of glucose or pyruvate. The entry of CH3NH3+ supported by glucose oxidation in an F1F0-ATPase-deficient mutant was blocked by uncoupler. Transport by wild-type cells under similar conditions was significantly inhibited by arsenate. Thus, CH3NH3+ uptake requires both ATP and an electrochemical H+ gradient. This transport activity was lost upon exposure of E. coli to osmotic shock, but could be recovered by incubation of shocked cells with boiled shock fluid or with glucose plus K+ in the presence of chloramphenicol. Similar reconstitution was observed in K+-depleted parental strains, but not in a mutant defective in K+ transport, demonstrating a requirement for internal K+. However, external K+ proved to be a noncompetitive inhibitor (Ki = 1 mM) of CH3NH3+ uptake by K+ -replete bacteria. External Na+ had no effect on transport. The addition of NH4+ or CH3NH3+ induced a rapid exodus of intracellular 86Rb+, an analog which was able to substitute for K+. The molar ratio of CH3NH3+ uptake to Rb+ exit was 1.12 +/- 0.11. These findings support a mechanism for CH3NH3+ (NH4+) accumulation which requires K+ antiport (exchange) and is driven by the electrochemical K+ gradient."
https://openalex.org/W1521050868,"Diethyl pyrocarbonate (ethoxyformic anhydride) was used to modify histidyl residues in prothrombin. Diethyl pyrocarbonate inactivated the potential fibrinogen-clotting activity of prothrombin with a second-order rate constant of 70 M-1 min-1 at pH 6.0 and 25 degrees C. The difference spectrum of the modified protein had a maximum absorption at 240 nm which is characteristic of N-carbethoxyhistidine. The pH dependence for inactivation suggested the participation of a residue with a pKa of 6.2. Addition of hydroxylamine to ethoxyformylated prothrombin reversed the loss of fibrinogen-clotting activity. No structural differences were detected between the native and modified proteins using fluorescence emission and high-performance size-exclusion chromatography. The tyrosine and tryptophan content was not altered, but approximately 1-2 amino groups were modified. Statistical analysis of residual enzyme activity and extent of modification indicates that among 7 histidyl residues modified per molecule, there is 1 essential histidine (not in the active site) involved in the potential fibrinogen-clotting activity of prothrombin. To further examine its properties, the modified prothrombin was activated to thrombin using Echis carinatus venom protease. There was no difference in the catalytic activity of thrombin obtained from either native or ethoxyformylated prothrombin, as measured by H-D-Phe-pipecolyl-Arg-p-nitroanilide (D-Phe-Pip-Arg-NA) hydrolysis. However, thrombin produced from the modified protein showed a loss of fibrinogen-clotting activity but had a comparable apparent Ki value (about 20 microM) to thrombin from native prothrombin when fibrinogen was used as a competitive inhibitor during D-Phe-Pip-Arg-NA hydrolysis. The similarity in Ki values indicated that thrombin derived from diethyl pyrocarbonate-modified prothrombin does not have an altered fibrinogen-binding site. Although the histidyl residue involved during inactivation has not been identified, the results suggest that a histidyl residue in the thrombin portion of prothrombin is essential for interaction with fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1524310632,"Dissociation of RNA and DNA from Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in transcription complexes prepared with enzyme molecules located within and near a rho-dependent transcription termination region on bacteriophage T7 D111 DNA has been studied using a membrane filter-binding assay. Rho protein with ATP present mediated rapid (half-time approximately 27 s) simultaneous dissociation of about 50% of both RNA and DNA. RNA molecules were preferentially released from enzyme molecules located within the termination region. Rapid release of RNA and DNA depended on a nucleoside triphosphate but did not depend on sigma factor. Pretreatment of complexes with ribonuclease prevented dissociation of DNA. Nearly simultaneous dissociation of both RNA and DNA was also detected after a lag of 3 min when the isolated transcription complexes were incubated with all four ribonucleoside triphosphates in the absence of rho factor. In this case, release presumably occurred at the rho-independent termination site that is 5990 nucleotides downstream from the A1 promoter. Thus, the dissociation of DNA from RNA polymerase at rho-dependent and rho-independent transcription termination sites is coupled with or occurs spontaneously soon after the release of transcripts at both sites."
https://openalex.org/W2997521,"In attempts to overproduce the wild type and, eventually, mutant human initiator methionine tRNAs for use in structure-function relationship studies, we have investigated the expression of the wild type human initiator tRNA gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both in vitro and in vivo. We find that the yeast extract, while capable of accurately transcribing several yeast tRNA genes, does not transcribe the human initiator tRNA gene. In addition, when the human initiator tRNA gene is introduced into yeast as part of a 2 mu vector, no expression of the human tRNA gene was detected. A yeast alanine tRNA gene similarly introduced into yeast is expressed efficiently. The block in expression of the human tRNA gene is at the level of transcription and not processing. The yeast cell-free extract can accurately process precursors of the same human initiator tRNA made in a HeLa cell-free extract. Surprisingly, although the human tRNA gene has essentially the same intragenic control elements as the yeast initiator tRNA gene, the human tRNA gene competes extremely poorly for transcription factors in yeast extracts. In the course of screening a yeast DNA bank for initiator tRNA clones we have isolated and sequenced three yeast tRNA genes corresponding to glycine, alanine, and aspartic acid tRNAs. The sequence of glycine tRNA gene differs from the published tRNA sequence in having an additional nucleotide in the variable loop. The alanine tRNA gene codes for a new tRNA. All three genes are transcriptionally active in yeast extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1481139836,"Two peptide chain initiation factor activities, eIF-2y and Co-eIF-2A20y, were purified from the high speed supernatant fraction of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and their properties were studied. 1) In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, purified eIF-2y showed two major polypeptide bands corresponding to molecular weights of 54,000 and 36,000. The Mr 54,000 band was significantly more intense than the Mr 36,000 band, indicating the possible presence of two polypeptides of equal molecular weight in this band. The molecular weight of eIF-2y, determined using a density gradient centrifugation method, was approximately 140,000. 2) In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, purified Co-eIF-2A20y showed a single polypeptide band corresponding to a molecular weight of 20,000. A similar molecular weight for Co-eIF-2A20y was also found using a density gradient centrifugation method. 3) In partial reactions, eIF-2y bound Met-tRNAf in the presence of Mg2+. The reaction required GTP. Co-eIF-2A20y stimulated Met-tRNAf binding to eIF-2y (2-3-fold) and also rendered the complex stable to 3 X 10(-5) M aurintricarboxylic acid. 4) This Co-eIF-2A20y activity was heat-labile and N-ethylmaleimide-insensitive. 5) Antibodies were prepared by injecting rabbits with homogeneous Co-eIF-2A20y. Such anti-Co-eIF-2A20y inhibited (60%) protein synthesis in a yeast cell-free protein synthesizing system and completely blocked Co-eIF-2A20y stimulation of Met-tRNAf. 40 S initiation complex formation. Protein synthesis inhibition by anti-Co-eIF-2A20y was almost completely reversed by preincubation of the antibodies specifically with homogeneous Co-eIF-2A20y."
https://openalex.org/W1515049367,"The high molecular weight protein complex, Co-eIF-2, contains both Co-eIF-2A and Co-eIF-2C activities (Bagchi, M. K., Banerjee, A. C., Roy, R., Chakravarty, I., and Gupta, N. K. (1982) Nucleic Acids Res. 10, 6501-6510). Co-eIF-2A stimulated Met-tRNAf binding to eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2) both in the presence and absence of Mg2+. Co-eIF-2C stimulates Met-tRNAf binding to eIF-2 in the presence of Mg2+ by relieving Mg2+ inhibition of ternary complex formation from eIF-2. Co-eIF-2 protein complex contains several polypeptides including Mr 80,000 and 50,000 polypeptides. Three polypeptides (Mr 80,000, 50,000 and 25,000) are present in 0.5 M KCl ribosomal salt wash and each possesses Co-eIF-2A activity. Mr 80,000 polypeptide (Co-eIF-2A80) has been purified to homogeneity and its properties studied. 1) Co-eIF-2A80 stimulated Met-tRNAf binding to eIF-2 and the complex formed was resistant to aurintricarboxylic acid. 2) Co-eIF-2A80 activity was N-ethylmaleimide-resistant and heat-labile; it was destroyed by heating at 55 degrees C for 4 min. 3) Antibodies prepared against homogeneous Co-eIF-2A80 strongly inhibited protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysates and, also, eIF-2 and Co-eIF-2 promoted Met-tRNAf binding to 40 S ribosomes. Inhibition of protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysates was overcome by preincubation of anti-Co-eIF-2A80 with homogeneous Co-eIF-2A80 and was partially overcome by similar preincubation with Co-eIF-2. 4) Upon limited digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, the homogeneous Co-eIF-2A80 gave two major polypeptide fragments (Mr 50,000 and 25,000). Upon similar treatment, an Mr 80,000 polypeptide band isolated from the sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel of the Co-eIF-2 protein complex gave four major polypeptide fragments, and two of these fragments (Mr 50,000 and 25,000) were similar to those given by Co-eIF-2A80, indicating that this Mr 80,000 polypeptide band contains the Co-eIF-2A80 component. We suggest that Co-eIF-2A80 is a component of Co-eIF-2 and is also essential for Co-eIF-2 activity and overall peptide chain initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1542055107,"In Klebsiella pneumoniae, the nifH gene encodes the Fe protein (Kp2) polypeptide that is assembled into a homodimer responsible for the reduction of nitrogenase. Escherichia coli or the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transformed with the K. pneumoniae nifH gene in suitable expression vectors, synthesize the Fe protein polypeptide. This study examines the assembly of the nifH gene product into its characteristic dimeric structure in E. coli and in yeast. Immunoblotting methods, as well as 55Fe2- labeling of K. pneumoniae were employed to detect native nitrogenase components in cell lysates. E. coli and yeast transformants contained a protein similar to native Kp2 in its immunoreactivity, apparent molecular weight, and lability in the presence of oxygen or MgATP. While in E. coli the co-introduction of nifH and nifM resulted in enhanced levels of the nifH product, it appears that the nifH gene product alone is sufficient for the assembly of an Fe protein-like structure in foreign prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts."
https://openalex.org/W1605061380,"A thiol protease has been isolated and purified from the postribosomal fraction of encysted embryos of the brine shrimp Artemia using a six-step procedure. The purified enzyme has a molecular weight of 55,000 +/- 4,200 and is composed of subunits of Mr 31,500 +/- 559 and 25,867 +/- 1,087. Isoelectric focusing revealed two discrete bands, one at pH 4.6 and the other at pH 5.1. The protease appears to be a member of the thiol group of proteases based on its inhibition by leupeptin, antipain, chymostatin, Ep-475, and several other thiol protease inhibitors. The enzyme was stimulated by heavy metal chelators and thiol reagents. At pH 3.5-4.0 the thiol protease hydrolyzed a wide range of proteins including bovine serum albumin, hemoglobin, Artemia embryo soluble proteins, Artemia lipovitelline, and protamine, whereas at pH 6.0-6.5 the enzyme showed a high degree of specificity for Artemia elongation factor 2 and lipovitelline alpha 1. The total amount of protease activity in crude homogenates of Artemia embryos decreased by about 50% during the first 24 h of development, while the amount of free, active enzyme decreased proportionally for 9 h of development then remained constant during the next 26-27 h of development. These changes in protease activity appear to reflect changing levels of an endogenous protease inhibitor during development."
https://openalex.org/W1572775832,"The endocytic activity of chick myotubes in cultures was investigated. Differentiated myotubes internalized the fluid-phase marker horseradish peroxidase in membrane-bound particles which typically displayed reaction product at the inner surface of the vesicle. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated a rapid decrease in the number of horseradish peroxidase-containing vesicles and a redistribution from a uniform to a perinuclear pattern. Horseradish peroxidase uptake was extensively inhibited by incubation at 0-4 degrees C consistent with an endocytic mechanism. To further characterize the process, the fate of labeled protein was investigated. Following uptake [3H] hemoglobin A was extensively degraded (40-50%) to acid-soluble products within 10 h. Degradation displayed a biphasic pattern with a rapid early phase followed by a much slower second phase. The decreasing rate of proteolysis can be accounted for, in part, by a simultaneous exocytosis of a substantial fraction (25-30%) of acid-insoluble label from myotubes. The lysosomotropic agents methylamine, monensin, and chloroquine significantly inhibited (23-75%) proteolysis, indicating a lysosomal site of degradation. Part of the inhibitory effect results from an increase in exocytosis in the presence of these agents. Degradation of endocytosed [3H]hemoglobin A was not inhibited by insulin. In contrast degradation of endogenous myotube proteins was inhibited (40%) by insulin and blocked by methylamine. These results suggest that cultured myotubes possess a coupled endocytic/exocytic pathway for macromolecules and that a fraction of the internalized substrate is degraded by an insulin-insensitive lysosomal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1516770183,"The cell-free biosynthesis of the bone protein osteonectin was studied using mRNA from fetal porcine calvariae. Total RNA was extracted from the calvariae with guanidinium thiocyanate and was partially purified by precipitation with acid/ethanol. Translations were performed using the reticulocyte lysate system and were optimized with respect to mRNA concentration and K+ (70 mM) and Mg2+ (0.6 mM) concentration. Cell-free synthesized osteonectin, radiolabeled with [35S]methionine, was specifically immunoprecipitated with rabbit antiserum to porcine osteonectin and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. When analyzed under reduced conditions, the translated protein migrated with an Mr 45,000 compared to an Mr 39,000 for cell-synthesized osteonectin. When translated in the presence of microsomal membranes, the immunoprecipitated osteonectin co-migrated with the cell-synthesized osteonectin, indicating that a signal sequence of about 45-50 amino acids (Mr 6,000) had been removed. Under nonreduced conditions the pre-osteonectin co-migrated with osteonectin (Mr 39,000) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that a highly folded structure is retained by disulfide bridges under denaturing conditions. The relationship between the immunoprecipitated pre-osteonectin from the cell-free translations and both the cell-synthesized and tissue-extracted osteonectin was confirmed by one-dimensional peptide mapping of Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease digestions. The results indicate that porcine osteonectin is synthesized on polysomes in a pre-osteonectin form which is translocated vectorially into microsomal vesicles and cotranslationally processed by the removal of a signal peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1491085595,"Treatment of homogeneous preparations of Escherichia coli 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase with 1,2-cyclohexanedione, 2,3-butanedione, phenylglyoxal, or 2,4-pentanedione results in a time- and concentration-dependent loss of enzymatic activity; the kinetics of inactivation are pseudo-first order. Cyclohexanedione is the most effective modifier; a plot of log (1000/t 1/2) versus log [cyclohexanedione] gives a straight line with slope = 1.1, indicating that one molecule of modifier reacts with each active unit of enzyme. The kinetics of inactivation are first order with respect to cyclohexanedione, suggesting that the loss of activity is due to modification of 1 arginine residue/subunit. Controls establish that this inactivation is not due to modifier-induced dissociation or photoinduced structural alteration of the aldolase. The same Km but decreased Vmax values are obtained when partially inactivated enzyme is compared with native. Amino acid analyses of 95% inactivated aldolase show the loss of 1 arginine/subunit with no significant change in other amino acid residues. Considerable protection against inactivation is provided by the substrates 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate and pyruvate (75 and 50%, respectively) and to a lesser extent (40 and 35%, respectively) by analogs like 2-keto-4-hydroxybutyrate and 2-keto-3-deoxyarabonate. In contrast, formaldehyde or glycolaldehyde (analogs of glyoxylate) under similar conditions show no protective effect. These results indicate that an arginine residue is required for E. coli 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase activity; it most likely participates in the active site of the enzyme by interacting with the carboxylate anion of the pyruvate-forming moiety of 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate."
https://openalex.org/W1527580716,"A newly recognized peptidase, designated proteinase yscD, was purified from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

[3H]Methylcasein does not serve as a substrate. Optimum pH for cleavage of Bz-Pro-Phe-Arg-4-nitroanilide is in the range of 6.5 to 7; for Ac-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-4-nitroanilide the range is between 5.75 and 6. For MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Met-4-nitroanilide the pH optimum was found to be 5.5. The purified enzyme has an apparent Stokes radius of Rs = 37.9 A as judged by gel chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates a molecular weight of approximately 83,000 for the enzyme. Mercurials and EDTA were found to be potent inhibitors of proteinase yscD activity."
https://openalex.org/W1557438712,"delta 4-3-Ketosteroid 5 beta-reductase was purified from male rat liver cytosol. The purification scheme consisted of column chromatographies on hydroxylapatite and DEAE-Sepharose, chromatofocusing, and Sephadex G-75 gel filtration followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The column chromatography steps gave a 100-fold purification and resulted in a 90% pure preparation as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Kinetic properties with 4-androstene-3,17-dione as substrate were established for the enzyme, and its activity regarding three other delta 4-3-ketosteroids, testosterone, progesterone, and cortisol, was investigated. The relative rates of reduction of these steroids were 1.0, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.62, respectively. The electrophoretically purified 5 beta-reductase, with an Mr of 38,000, was used for immunization of rabbits. The antiserum was shown to be monospecific as judged from immunoblotting of electrophoretically separated rat liver cytosolic proteins. Immunological reactive protein and enzymatic 5 beta-reductase activity co-purified in the chromatographic steps. The sex difference in enzyme activity, 0.26 versus 0.10 nmol of product/mg of proteins/min for males and females, respectively, was shown to be due to a difference in concentration of enzyme protein. The 5 beta-reductase was calculated to constitute 1% of the total cytosolic proteins in male livers, whereas the corresponding figure for female livers was 0.3%."

A purified 21-acyl [3H] corticosterone fraction was obtained by subjecting extracts of the incubated tissues to Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography followed by partitioning between n-heptane/methanol. The methanol extracts were chromatographed consecutively on columns of silica gel and C18-silanized (reverse-phase) silica gel. The radioactive product was methoximated and re-chromatographed on the reverse-phase column. Mass spectral analysis of the 21-acyl [3H] corticosterone 3,20-dimethoxime and synthetic corticosterone 21-oleate 3,20-dimethoxime suggested identity. Confirmation of the precise nature of the 21-acyl moiety was obtained by isotope dilution analysis of the underivatized radiometabolite with corticosterone 21-oleate. The composition of the 21-acyl [3H] corticosterone fraction (i.e. before extensive purification) was ascertained by isotope dilution analysis with various corticosterone esters. It appears that [3H] corticosterone 21-oleate is a major component of this fraction, representing 80% of the radioactivity; [3H] corticosterone 21-linoleate is a minor component, i.e. 8.6%. [3H] Corticosterone 21-palmitate, [3H] corticosterone 21-arachidonate, and [3H] corticosterone 21-stearate, if indeed present, constitute considerably less than 14, 6, and 2%, respectively, of the radiometabolite fraction. It is suggested that bioacylation of corticosterone serves to modulate the biological action of the glucocorticoid hormone on the mammary glands during lactation."
https://openalex.org/W1617738283,"Abstract The cleavage of an amino-terminal decapeptide from Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase has been previously described (Roberts, C. H., and Chlebowski, J. F. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 729-733) by this laboratory. The modest reduction in specific activity of the modified enzyme is paralleled by an apparent alteration in the Zn(II) affinity at one of the three active center metal ion binding sites. In contrast to the behavior of the native enzyme, formation of the metal-free apoprotein results in an irreversible loss of catalytic activity; phosphohydrolase activity is not restored on addition of Zn(II) and Mg(II). Differential scanning calorimetry and velocity sedimentation data indicate that the apo form of the modified enzyme exists as a monomer form which, while capable of binding Zn(II) does not readily reassociate to active dimer. Processive cleavage of the amino termini of the dimer by trypsin results in the transient formation of a hybrid dimer consisting of cleaved and uncleaved subunits. This species can be directly observed and isolated by taking advantage of the differential chromatographic mobility of the native isozymes and the resulting products. Coupled with improved procedures for the preparation of the modified protein, these data indicate that the amino-terminal modification results in alterations in the subunit interface domain and provides a species (the hybrid dimer) for the investigation of the propagation of these effects."

The RC of R. sphaeroides is composed of three polypeptide subunits, H, M, and L, apparent molecular mass as determined in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, of 28,000, 24,000, and 21,000, respectively. The intra-complex products produced, were found to contain the polypeptides H-M-L, H-M, H-L, and M-L linked together. In addition, the cross-linking of cytochrome c to solubilized and membrane-bound RCs was observed with all four reagents. The products were found to be only a cytochrome c linked to either the M or L polypeptide. These results indicate that a portion of the L and M subunits of the RC must be exposed in situ on the periplasmic surface of the membrane near a binding site for cytochrome c on the RC, and all three subunits must be in close proximity to one another."
https://openalex.org/W1566018115,"The yeast gene TRP5 is regulated by the general control system of amino acid biosynthesis. A TRP5-lacZ translational fusion was constructed in order to facilitate assay for TRP5 promoter function and regulation. The chromosomally integrated fusion was derepressed 4-5-fold by lysine limitation. Thus, the TRP5-lacZ fusion is regulated by general control. Deletions were constructed in vitro in the 5'-flanking region of cloned TRP5-lacZ. These deletions localized the promoter region to within 188 base pairs of the transcription start site. Two separable subregions of the promoter were localized by further deletion mapping. The boundaries of the promoter regions are approximately -188 to -114 and -91 to -29. The TATA box is contained within the downstream promoter region. Regulatory regions essential for general control overlap with these promoter elements. Each of two separable regulatory regions contains a copy of the TGACT repeat (Donahue, T. F., Daves, R. S., Lucchini, G., and Fink, G. R.

https://openalex.org/W1497024597,"Ribonucleoside and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools have been measured in Escherichia coli infected with bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase mutator, wild type, and antimutator alleles during mutagenesis by the base analogue 2-aminopurine. ATP and GTP pools expand significantly during mutagenesis, while CTP and UTP pools contract slightly. The DNA polymerase (gene 43) alleles and an rII lesion perturb normal dNTP pools more than does the presence of 2-aminopurine. We find no evidence that 2-aminopurine induces mutations indirectly by causing an imbalance in normal dNTP pools. Rather, it seems likely that, by forming base mispairs with thymine and with cytosine, 2-aminopurine is involved directly in causing bidirectional A.T in equilibrium G.C transitions. The ratios for 2-aminopurine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate/dATP pools are 5-8% for tsL56 mutator and 1-5% for tsL141 antimutator and 43+ alleles. We conclude that the significant differences observed in the frequencies of induced transition mutations in the three alleles can be attributed primarily to the properties of the DNA polymerases with their associated 3'-exonuclease activities in controlling the frequency of 2-aminopurine.cystosine base mispairs."

Chem. 256, 8074-8079) has been investigated in further detail. The enzyme initiates exonucleolytic hydrolysis from the 3'-end of DNA in a nonprocessive, or distributive, manner, regardless of whether the carbohydrate moiety associated with the 3'-terminal nucleotide contains H or OH at its 2' and 3' positions. DNase VII does not have associated RNase H activity; however, it is capable of removing 3'-terminal ribonucleotides. The enzyme also can hydrolyze DNA containing a terminal nucleotide lacking a purine or pyrimidine as well as termini containing noncomplementary nucleotides. DNase VII activity is product-inhibited by deoxynucleoside 5'-monophosphates. From kinetic studies, the mononucleotide deoxyadenylic acid is a noncompetitive inhibitor with a Ki = 0.3 mM. The resemblance of DNase VII to the 3'----5' exonuclease activity of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and its possible role in excision repair and proofreading are discussed."

C., and Powers, J. C. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5085-5091). We have prepared additional derivatives of this structure in which fluorine substitutions have been made on the aromatic rings and have attempted to carry out fluorine NMR studies of the interaction of Powers' compound and these new derivatives with chymotrypsin. The solubility of all inhibitors examined in solvent systems compatible with the retention of native enzyme structure is extremely low. While some nmr evidence for complex formation could be obtained, preparations of the complexes examined were metastable and precipitation of the inhibitor eventually limits the amount of complex that can be present in solution to such low levels that nmr experiments are impractical. An unusual effect of solvent composition on fluorine chemical shifts suggests that the conformation of the inhibitors in aqueous solution and when bound to the enzyme is different from that in organic solvents."
