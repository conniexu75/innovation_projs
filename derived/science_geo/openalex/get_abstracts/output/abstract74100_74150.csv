https://openalex.org/W2064875380,"TREMORINE (1-4 dipyrolidine-2-butyn (T)) has stimulated an interest in an experimental pharmacology because it is the first substance which can definitely produce rest tremor, rigor and akinesia, that is, the symptoms of Parkinson's disease1. Further, the symptoms produced in tremorine-induced tremor (TT) can be relieved with all known, anti-Parkinson substances and drugs inhibiting the cholinergic nervous system. Recently, Cho and Jendon2 found that symptoms produced with (T) or with oxotremorin (oxo-T), an active principle of T, can be removed with an analogue of T, 1-4-bis(N-hexamethylenimino)-2-butyn (anti-T). T itself is the most specific substance. Everett1 states that among many similar derivatives only T produces tremor."
https://openalex.org/W2066912668,"IT is now well known that adenosine and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) strongly inhibit the aggregation of human and rabbit platelets which occurs in the presence of adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Adenosine and AMP are effective at a concentration of approximately 10−7 M, and are the most potent naturally occurring inhibitors known. O'Brien1 has shown that antihistaminics, anti-malarials, and local anaesthetics, all at approximately 10−3 M, inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation. It has recently been reported by Salzman and Chambers2 that substituted amino-acids, at a concentration of 1.5 × 10−2 M, inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation."

https://openalex.org/W1989308013,"THE new serum type system Lp1 is a useful genetic marker system, the frequency of the Lpa gene being approximately 0.18 in Caucasians2,3 and test reagents unrestrictedly available. Concerning the serum type system Inv (refs. 4 and 5), test reagents have been relatively difficult to obtain, but are now increasingly available5–8. The established Inva or Inv1a gene frequencies, 0.06–0.10 in Caucasians and considerably higher in other populations, would indicate common use of this marker system in the future. This pre-supposes the elucidation of the genetics of this system, including analysis of linkage relationships. This communication provides data on the Inv–Lp linkage relation."
