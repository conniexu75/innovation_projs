https://openalex.org/W2043081407,"Infanticide, although common in a wide range of species including humans and other primates, is poorly understood. A 7-year study under natural conditions reveals that infanticide within colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) is striking for three reasons. It is the major source of juvenile mortality, accounting for the total or partial demise of 51 percent of all litters born. The most common killers are resident lactating females. The most common victims are the offspring of close kin."
https://openalex.org/W2078723503,"Middle Devonian articulate brachiopods (Ludlowville and Moscow Formations, Hamilton Group, New York) have external tapered holes with a central boss that are indistinguishable from drillholes of naticid gastropods that are known from the Triassic and later. Drillholes are specific to prey (ribbed shells were avoided) and specific to sites on prey. Healed drillholes suggest penetration of live prey. As many as 44 percent of the preferred prey are drilled, indicating a level of predation that has been reported only from post-Paleozoic strata."

https://openalex.org/W2023929901,Light energy absorbed by the 576 bilin chromophores in the six rods of the phycobilisome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6701 is funneled into a 1.5 x 10(6) dalton core. The 72 bilins of the core function as a single unit with respect to the rate-limiting processes for energy flow within these particles.
https://openalex.org/W2150172531,"A comprehensive framework is developed and applied to estimate the economic costs incurred by the Soviet Union in acquiring, maintaining, and expanding its empire. The terms ""empire"" and ""costs"" are explicitly defined. Between 1971 and 1980, the average ratio between empire costs and Soviet gross national product was about 3.5 percent; as a ratio to Soviet military spending, empire costs averaged about 28 percent. The burden imposed on Soviet economic growth by empire costs is also considered, as well as rates of change in these costs, and the important political, military, and strategic benefits associated by the Soviet leadership with maintenance and expansion of the empire. Prospective empire costs and changes in Soviet economic constraints resulting from the declining performance of the domestic economy are also considered."

https://openalex.org/W4239113312,"In the letter by M. F. Balandrin and J. A. Klocke (13 Sept., p. 1036), it was incorrectly stated that nabilone (Cesamet) has been approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration. Nabilone has not yet been approved by the FDA. The synthetic cannabinoid recently approved is in fact dronabinol (Marinol), a synthetic form of delta-9-tetra-hydrocannabinol. In the same letter, the affiliation of the authors should have been Native Plants, Inc., not Nature Plants, Inc. In the original article by Balandrin et al. (7 June, p. 1154), references 23 and 65 were incorrect. They should have been as follows: 23. Y. Aharonowitz and G. Cohen, Sci. Am. 245, 140 (September 1981); 65. D. E. Eveleigh, Sci. Am. 245, 154 (September 1981)."
