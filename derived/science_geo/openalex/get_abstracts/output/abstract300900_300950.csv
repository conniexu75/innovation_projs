https://openalex.org/W2011067252,"Essentially all models that have been proposed for predator-prey systems are shown to possess either a stable point equilibrium or a stable limit cycle. This stable limit cycle, an explicitly nonlinear feature, is commonly overlooked in conventional analyses of these models. Such a stable limit cycle provides a satisfying explanation for those animal communities in which populations are observed to oscillate in a rather reproducible periodic manner."

https://openalex.org/W2020863384,"Observations made by using conventional scuba techniques reveal that abandoned larvacean houses serve as food sources for marine, planktonic copepods. Techniques have been developed for photographing these houses in the field for the first time. The abundance of larvacean houses in the open ocean indicates that they are important in pelagic food webs and as a source of particulate organic matter."

For optimum induction of passive disease, cells must be transferred before the day on which the disease becomes manifest in the donor."
https://openalex.org/W2080365826,"After its successful soft landing on the moon on 9 September 1967, Surveyor 5 transmitted back to earth signals
which contained the first factual information on the chemical composition of the lunar soil. The data were
obtained from the alpha-scattering experiment performed by a relatively simple instrument placed on the lunar
soil. A radioactive source emitted alpha particles which were directed at the lunar surface. The particles were then
scattered back by collisions with the constituent atoms of the lunar material and counted by suitably positioned,
energy-sensitive detectors. From such measurements one can determine the mass of the collision partner and therefore
identify the elements present in the soil (1, 2). These backscattering analyses agree remarkably well with
the chemical analyses later made on samples of moon rocks returned to earth by the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions (3)."

Some of the structure was roofed to form a lava tube, parts of which have subsequently collapsed."
https://openalex.org/W2056980495,"Calcium oxalate crystals occur in the marine green algae Penicillus, Rhipocephalus, and Udotea, known as producers of sedimentary aragonite needles. In contrast to the externally deposited aragonite crystals which are generally < 15 micrometers long, the oxalate crystals are larger (up to 150 micrometers) and are located in the vacuolar system of the plant. No calcium oxalate was found in the related but noncalcifying genera Avrainvillea and Cladocephalus."
https://openalex.org/W1978823904,"The preservation and maintenance of natural park ecosystems, with modern man's being restricted to generally nonconsumptive uses of the park, represents one end of a spectrum of land use that extends through exploitation of natural ecosystems to the development of simplified agricultural ecosystems. Criteria for management of a park ecosystem must, of necessity, differ from criteria for other uses of land, since park management involves preventing or compensating for the influence of man. The objectives for natural areas appear to be ecologically feasible if it is recognized that these areas have a finite capacity for absorbing man's consumptive and disruptive influences. The interpretation of ecosystems to park visitors provides an opportunity to contribute to an environmental ethic that extends beyond the park environment."
https://openalex.org/W2072858867,"Magnetic compressions intermittently observed outside the lunar wake in the solar wind may be limb shocks caused by the presence of local regions of permanent magnetism on the lunar limb. Observable compression would be due to regions of length scale (radius) at least as great as several tens of kilometers and field strength greater, similar 10 gammas. Thousands of such regions might exist on the lunar surface. The steady magnetic field measured at the Apollo 12 site probably has length scale less, similar 10 kilometers and probably does not produce an observable limb shock."
https://openalex.org/W1973411378,"With the same extraction conditions used for Gonyaulax polyedra, soluble and particulate bioluminescence can be isolated from two additional species, Pyrodinium bahamense and Pyrocystis lunula. We have been able, for all three species, to dissociate soluble luciferin and luciferase from the particulate system. Luciferin can be incorporated into both reacted and unreacted particulate systems."
https://openalex.org/W2001562396,"Purified water, intensively redistilled and allowed to overflow so as to shed residual adsorbate from the container, acquires a limiting thermal sensitivity to additions of long-chain fatty acids and alcohols. Thus two to three molecules of cis-13-docosenoic acid supplied for each 1000 molecules of exposed surface of water held quietly at the normal boiling point increases the superheat, Î”t8, by 10 percent."
https://openalex.org/W2045679086,"Mapping of the surface breaks that resulted from the San Fernando earthquake of 9 February 1971 reveals that the pattern of faulting was highly complex; it consisted of a number of segments that produced ground displacements and acceleration throughout the entire northern end of the San Fernando Valley. Instead of occurring on the frontal fault zone, as might have been expected, the faulting occurred on the valley side of the frontal fault system, which separates the crystalline rocks of the San Gabriel Mountains from the Tertiary sediments of the San Fernando Valley. However, the new fault system does, in many cases, follow breaks in slope and subtle escarpments that suggest faulting along these zones in the recent geologic past."

https://openalex.org/W1976432468,"Variations in atmospheric turbidity at Tucson, Arizona, since 1956 are similar to those at Mauna Loa in Hawaii, especially before January 1970. The turbidity at both locations increased markedly in 1963 after the Bali eruption. Since January 1970, the turbidity has returned to its pre-1963 level at Mauna Loa, but has remained relatively high at Tucson."
