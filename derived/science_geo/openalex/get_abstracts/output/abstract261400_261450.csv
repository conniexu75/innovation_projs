https://openalex.org/W2066738380,"CD4+ T cells have a crucial role in mediating protection against a variety of pathogens through production of specific cytokines. However, substantial heterogeneity in CD4+ T-cell cytokine responses has limited the ability to define an immune correlate of protection after vaccination. Here, using multiparameter flow cytometry to assess the immune responses after immunization, we show that the degree of protection against Leishmania major infection in mice is predicted by the frequency of CD4+ T cells simultaneously producing interferon-gamma, interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor. Notably, multifunctional effector cells generated by all vaccines tested are unique in their capacity to produce high amounts of interferon-gamma. These data show that the quality of a CD4+ T-cell cytokine response can be a crucial determinant in whether a vaccine is protective, and may provide a new and useful prospective immune correlate of protection for vaccines based on T-helper type 1 (TH1) cells."
https://openalex.org/W2107179162,"The role of quantum coherence in promoting the efficiency of the initial stages of photosynthesis is an open and intriguing question. We performed a two-color photon echo experiment on a bacterial reaction center that enabled direct visualization of the coherence dynamics in the reaction center. The data revealed long-lasting coherence between two electronic states that are formed by mixing of the bacteriopheophytin and accessory bacteriochlorophyll excited states. This coherence can only be explained by strong correlation between the protein-induced fluctuations in the transition energy of neighboring chromophores. Our results suggest that correlated protein environments preserve electronic coherence in photosynthetic complexes and allow the excitation to move coherently in space, enabling highly efficient energy harvesting and trapping in photosynthesis."

Outside the HLA region, the most significant finding (rs13119723; P = 2.0 x 10(-7)) was in the KIAA1109-TENR-IL2-IL21 linkage disequilibrium block. We independently confirmed association in two further collections (strongest association at rs6822844, 24 kb 5' of IL21; meta-analysis P = 1.3 x 10(-14), odds ratio = 0.63), suggesting that genetic variation in this region predisposes to celiac disease."
https://openalex.org/W1991319303,"Although endocannabinoids constitute one of the first lines of defense against pain, the anatomical locus and the precise receptor mechanisms underlying cannabinergic modulation of pain are uncertain. Clinical exploitation of the system is severely hindered by the cognitive deficits, memory impairment, motor disturbances and psychotropic effects resulting from the central actions of cannabinoids. We deleted the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) specifically in nociceptive neurons localized in the peripheral nervous system of mice, preserving its expression in the CNS, and analyzed these genetically modified mice in preclinical models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. The nociceptor-specific loss of CB1 substantially reduced the analgesia produced by local and systemic, but not intrathecal, delivery of cannabinoids. We conclude that the contribution of CB1-type receptors expressed on the peripheral terminals of nociceptors to cannabinoid-induced analgesia is paramount, which should enable the development of peripherally acting CB1 analgesic agonists without any central side effects."

The emission intensity within distinct submicrometer segments of single nanotubes changed in discrete steps after exposure to acid, base, or diazonium reactants. The steps were uncorrelated in space and time and reflected the quenching of mobile excitons at localized sites of reversible or irreversible chemical attack. Analysis of step amplitudes revealed an exciton diffusional range of about 90 nanometers, independent of nanotube structure. Each exciton visited about 10,000 atomic sites during its lifetime, providing highly efficient sensing of local chemical and physical perturbations."

https://openalex.org/W2009117373,"Root hairs and rhizoids are cells with rooting functions in land plants. We describe two basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that control root hair development in the sporophyte (2 n ) of the angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana and rhizoid development in the gametophytes ( n ) of the bryophyte Physcomitrella patens . The phylogeny of land plants supports the hypothesis that early land plants were bryophyte-like and possessed a dominant gametophyte and later the sporophyte rose to dominance. If this hypothesis is correct, our data suggest that the increase in morphological complexity of the sporophyte body in the Paleozoic resulted at least in part from the recruitment of regulatory genes from gametophyte to sporophyte."

New x-ray–based experimental capabilities have been closely linked with advances in x-ray sources, a trend that will continue with the impending arrival of x-ray–free electron lasers driven by electron accelerators. We discuss recent advances in ultrafast x-ray science and coherent imaging made possible by linear-accelerator–based light sources. These studies highlight the promise of ultrafast x-ray lasers, as well as the technical challenges and potential range of applications that will accompany these transformative x-ray light sources."

https://openalex.org/W2092870606,"Allergic contact dermatitis affects about 5% of men and 11% of women in industrialized countries and is one of the leading causes for occupational diseases. In an animal model for cutaneous contact hypersensitivity, we show that mice lacking both known cannabinoid receptors display exacerbated allergic inflammation. In contrast, fatty acid amide hydrolase–deficient mice, which have increased levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide, displayed reduced allergic responses in the skin. Cannabinoid receptor antagonists exacerbated allergic inflammation, whereas receptor agonists attenuated inflammation. These results demonstrate a protective role of the endocannabinoid system in contact allergy in the skin and suggest a target for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2016581769,"Industrial logging has become the most extensive land use in Central Africa, with more than 600,000 square kilometers (30%) of forest currently under concession. With use of a time series of satellite imagery for the period from 1976 to 2003, we measured 51,916 kilometers of new logging roads. The density of roads across the forested region was 0.03 kilometer per square kilometer, but areas of Gabon and Equatorial Guinea had values over 0.09 kilometer per square kilometer. A new frontier of logging expansion was identified within the Democratic Republic of Congo, which contains 63% of the remaining forest of the region. Tree felling and skid trails increased disturbance in selectively logged areas."

https://openalex.org/W2039234080,We report seismic evidence for the transportation of water into the deep mantle in the subduction zone beneath northeastern Japan. Our data indicate that water is released from the hydrated oceanic crust at shallow depths (&lt; ∼100 kilometers) and then forms a channel of hydrated mantle material on top of the subducting plate that is the pathway for water into the deep mantle. Our result provides direct evidence that shows how water is transported from the ocean to the deep mantle in a cold subduction zone environment.

https://openalex.org/W2055022226,"We found monochromatic electron photoemission from large-area self-assembled monolayers of a functionalized diamondoid, [121]tetramantane-6-thiol. Photoelectron spectra of the diamondoid monolayers exhibited a peak at the low–kinetic energy threshold; up to 68% of all emitted electrons were emitted within this single energy peak. The intensity of the emission peak is indicative of diamondoids being negative electron affinity materials. With an energy distribution width of less than 0.5 electron volts, this source of monochromatic electrons may find application in technologies such as electron microscopy, electron beam lithography, and field-emission flat-panel displays."

https://openalex.org/W1978660097,"We describe a sensitive mRNA profiling technology, PMAGE (for ""polony multiplex analysis of gene expression""), which detects messenger RNAs (mRNAs) as rare as one transcript per three cells. PMAGE incorporates an improved ligation-based method to sequence 14-nucleotide tags derived from individual mRNA molecules. One sequence tag from each mRNA molecule is amplified onto a separate 1-micrometer bead, denoted as a polymerase colony or polony, and about 5 million polonies are arrayed in a flow cell for parallel sequencing. Using PMAGE, we identified early transcriptional changes that preceded pathological manifestations of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in mice carrying a disease-causing mutation. PMAGE provided a comprehensive profile of cardiac mRNAs, including low-abundance mRNAs encoding signaling molecules and transcription factors that are likely to participate in disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1999944134,"Myelination in the peripheral nervous system requires close contact between Schwann cells and the axon, but the underlying molecular basis remains largely unknown. Here we show that cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) of the nectin-like (Necl, also known as SynCAM or Cadm) family mediate Schwann cell–axon interaction during myelination. Necl4 is the main Necl expressed by myelinating Schwann cells and is located along the internodes in direct apposition to Necl1, which is localized on axons. Necl4 serves as the glial binding partner for axonal Necl1, and the interaction between these two CAMs mediates Schwann cell adhesion. The disruption of the interaction between Necl1 and Necl4 by their soluble extracellular domains, or the expression of a dominant-negative Necl4 in Schwann cells, inhibits myelination. These results suggest that Necl proteins are important for mediating axon-glia contact during myelination in peripheral nerves."

We characterize layer separation inside subducting plates with a coordinate rotation to calculate the slab-normal distribution of earthquakes. Benchmark tests on well-established examples confirm that layer separation is accurately quantified with global seismicity catalogs alone. Global analysis reveals double Benioff zones in 30 segments, including all 16 subduction zones investigated, with varying subducting plate ages and stress orientations, which implies that they are inherent in subducting plates. Layer separation increases with age and is more consistent with dehydration of antigorite than chlorite."
https://openalex.org/W1973486104,"Serotonin receptor 1A knockout (Htr1aKO) mice show increased anxiety-related behavior in tests measuring innate avoidance. Here we demonstrate that Htr1aKO mice show enhanced fear conditioning to ambiguous conditioned stimuli, a hallmark of human anxiety. To examine the involvement of specific forebrain circuits in this phenotype, we developed a pharmacogenetic technique for the rapid tissue- and cell type–specific silencing of neural activity in vivo. Inhibition of neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala suppressed conditioned responses to both ambiguous and nonambiguous cues. In contrast, inhibition of hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells selectively suppressed conditioned responses to ambiguous cues and reversed the knockout phenotype. These data demonstrate that Htr1aKO mice have a bias in the processing of threatening cues that is moderated by hippocampal mossy-fiber circuits, and suggest that the hippocampus is important in the response to ambiguous aversive stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2010866783,"Regions of the arterial tree exposed to laminar flow, which exerts high shear stress, are protected from inflammation, endothelial cell (EC) death and atherosclerosis. TNFalpha activates NF-kappaB transcription factors, which potentially exert dual functions by inducing both proinflammatory and cytoprotective transcripts. We assessed whether laminar shear stress protects EC by modulating NF-kappaB function. Human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) were cultured under shear stress (12 dynes/cm2 for 16 h) using a parallel-plate flow chamber or were maintained in static conditions. Comparative real-time PCR revealed that preshearing significantly alters transcriptional responses to TNFalpha by enhancing the expression of cytoprotective molecules (Bcl-2, MnSOD, GADD45beta, A1) and suppressing proinflammatory transcripts (E-selectin, VCAM-1, IL-8). We demonstrated using assays of nuclear localization, NF-kappaB subunit phosphorylation, DNA-binding, and transcriptional activity that NF-kappaB is activated by TNFalpha in presheared HUVEC. Furthermore, a specific inhibitor revealed that NF-kappaB is essential for the induction of cytoprotective transcripts in presheared EC. Finally, we observed that NF-kappaB can be activated in vascular endothelium exposed to laminar shear stress in NF-kappaB-luciferase reporter mice, thus validating our cell culture experiments. We conclude that shear stress primes EC for enhanced NF-kappaB-dependent cytoprotective responsiveness while attenuating proinflammatory activation. Thus modulation of NF-kappaB function may underlie the atheroprotective effects of laminar shear stress."
https://openalex.org/W2106253300,"We report that during cortical development in the mouse embryo, reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK) critically regulates Notch signaling by antagonizing the ectodomain shedding of Notch ligands, which is mediated by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 10 (ADAM10). In the embryonic brain, RECK is specifically expressed in Nestin-positive neural precursor cells (NPCs). Reck-deficient NPCs undergo precocious differentiation that is associated with downregulated Nestin expression, impaired Notch signaling and defective self-renewal. These phenotypes were substantially rescued either by enhancing Notch signaling or by suppressing endogenous ADAM10 activity. Consequently, we found that RECK regulates the ectodomain shedding of Notch ligands by directly inhibiting the proteolytic activity of ADAM10. This mechanism appeared to be essential for Notch ligands to properly induce Notch signaling in neighboring cells. These findings indicate that RECK is a physiological inhibitor of ADAM10, an upstream regulator of Notch signaling and a critical modulator of brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2067993898,"Vascular cell adhesion molecules, P- and L-selectins, facilitate metastasis of cancer cells in mice by mediating interactions with platelets, endothelium, and leukocytes. Heparanase is an endoglycosidase that degrades heparan sulfate of extracellular matrix, thereby promoting tumor invasion and metastasis. Heparin is known to efficiently attenuate metastasis in different tumor models. Here we identified modified, nonanticoagulant species of heparin that specifically inhibit selectin-mediated cell-cell interactions, heparanase enzymatic activity, or both. We show that selective inhibition of selectin interactions or heparanase with specific heparin derivatives in mouse models of MC-38 colon carcinoma and B16-BL6 melanoma attenuates metastasis. Selectin-specific heparin derivatives attenuated metastasis of MC-38 carcinoma, but heparanase-specific derivatives had no effect, in accordance with the virtual absence of heparanase activity in these cells. Heparin derivatives had no further effect on metastasis in mice deficient in P- and L-selectin, indicating that selectins are the primary targets of heparin antimetastatic activity. Selectin-specific and heparanase-specific derivatives attenuated metastasis of B16-BL6 melanomas to a similar extent. When mice were injected with a derivative containing both heparanase and selectin inhibitory activity, no additional attenuation of metastasis could be observed. Thus, selectin-specific heparin derivatives efficiently attenuated metastasis of both tumor cell types whereas inhibition of heparanase led to reduction of metastasis only in tumor cells producing heparanase."
https://openalex.org/W2008189019,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of severe vision loss in the elderly, is a complex disease that results from genetic modifications that increase susceptibility to environmental exposures. Smoking, a major source of oxidative stress, increases the incidence and severity of AMD, and antioxidants slow progression, suggesting that oxidative stress plays a major role. Polymorphisms in the complement factor H (CFH) gene that reduce activity of CFH increase the risk of AMD. In this study we demonstrate an interaction between these two risk factors, because oxidative stress reduces the ability of an inflammatory cytokine, interferon-γ, to increase CFH expression in retinal pigmented epithelial cells. The interferon-γ-induced increase in CFH is mediated by transcriptional activation by STAT1, and its suppression by oxidative stress is mediated by acetylation of FOXO3, which enhances FOXO3 binding to the CFH promoter, reduces its binding to STAT1, inhibits STAT1 interaction with the CFH promoter, and reduces expression of CFH. Expression of SIRT1, a mammalian homolog of NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sir2, attenuated FOXO3 recruitment to the CFH regulatory region and reversed the H2O2-induced repression of CFH gene expression. These data suggest an important interaction between environmental exposure and genetic susceptibility in the pathogenesis of AMD and, by elucidating molecular signaling involved in the interaction, provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

In addition, detailed analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in and around the CFH gene has identified variants, some in noncoding regions, with high risk (7Li M. Atmaca-Sonmez P. Othman M.

No single polymorphism could account for the contribution of CFH, and instead, haplotypes associated with increased or decreased risk were identified. The authors hypothesized that these haplotypes might modulate risk of AMD not by disrupting protein function but, rather, by altering expression. Therefore, either reducing the amount of CFH or reducing its complement-modulating activity may increase the risk of AMD. High risk and protective variants have also been identified in other genes that code for proteins involved in the regulation of complement, complement factor B, and complement component 2 (10Gold B. Merriam J.E. Zernant J. Hancox L.S. Taiber A.J. Gehrs K. Cramer K. Neel J. Bergeron J. Barile G.R. Smith R.T. Hageman G.S. Dean M. Allikmets R. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). This supports the hypothesis that dysregulation of complement activity contributes to the development of AMD. The strongest environmental risk factor for AMD is cigarette smoking, which is associated with substantially higher incidences of geographic atrophy and choroidal neovascularization (11Smith W.

The mechanism by which smoking increases the incidence and severity of AMD is uncertain, but cigarette smoke is known to contain numerous oxidants (13Smith C.J. Hansch C. Food Chem. Toxicol. 2000; 38: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Exposure of mice to cigarette smoke or hydroquinone, an oxidant known to be present in cigarette smoke, resulted in sub-RPE deposits and diffuse thickening of Bruch's membrane (14Espinosa-Heidmann D.G.

Sci. 2006; 47: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suggesting that oxidative stress is capable of promoting these phenotypic characteristics of AMD. Oxidative stress has also been implicated in AMD by the Age-Related Eye Disease Study, which showed that antioxidants and zinc reduce the risk of individuals with large drusen progressing to advanced AMD, defined as choroidal neovascularization or severe geographic atrophy involving the center of the fovea (15The Age-related Eye Disease Study Research GroupArch. Ophthalmol. 2001; 119: 1417-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar). Also, proteomic analysis has demonstrated that drusen contain numerous proteins with adducts that are commonly caused by oxidative damage (16Crabb J.W. Miyagi M. Gu X. Shadrach K. West K.

Thus, genetic studies suggest that the level of expression of CFH may play a role in the pathogenesis of AMD and several other lines of evidence implicate oxidative stress.

For each sample the same amount of total protein was added to a well of a 10% acrylamide gel and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 2 h before overnight incubation with primary antibody at 4 °C. A 1:500 dilution of anti-CFH and a 1:1000 dilution of all other primary antibodies was used. The proteins were detected by SuperSignal West Pico substrate solution using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce). Blots were quantified by densitometry using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX and Quantity One software. Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—The cells were harvested after various 24-h treatments, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and then incubated with rDNase I (DNA-free™ kit, Ambion, Austin, TX) to remove any traces of contaminating DNA. Reverse transcription was performed at 50 °C for 1 h using 2 μg of total RNA, 1 μl of Superscript ™ III reverse transcriptase, 1 μl of 50 μm oligo(dT)20, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP, 4 μl of 5× first-strand buffer, 1 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 1 μl of RNAseOUT (Invitrogen). Each 20-μl PCR reaction mixture was prepared using the LightCycler FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics). The +1118 to +1329 CFH primers (Table 1) were designed to hybridize in two different exons or at exon/intron boundaries to prevent amplification of any remaining genomic DNA. The amplification conditions were denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 55 °C for 5 s, and extension at 72 °C for 12 s for a total of 40 cycles. Under optimized conditions there was a single melting curve and no primer-dimer formation. The copy number for each mRNA was determined using a standard curve generated with external standards of known copy number. A fragment of the large P0 subunit of human ribosomal protein (primers, Table 1) was amplified to provide an internal control. Luciferase Assay—ARPE-19 cells were plated in 6-well plates, and transfections were done at 60–70% confluence. CFH promoter-luciferase reporter constructs in combination with Renilla luciferase control vector (pRL-SV40 vector, Promega) were transfected along with relevant FOXO3 constructs into ARPE-19 cells using Lipofectamine™ LTX (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells maintained in the medium containing serum were treated with IFN-γ and H2O2 for 5 h and lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega). For inhibitor studies, cells were pretreated with LY294002 for 30 min before the addition of IFN-γ and H2O2. Luciferase activity was measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system with a luminometer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase activities for transfection efficiency. Immunoprecipitation—ARPE-19 cells were plated (107/10-cm dish), and the following day at 80–90% confluence they were treated with IFN-γ and H2O2 for 1 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing deacetylase inhibitors (10 mm nicotinamide and 1 μm Trichostatin A), protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics mixture tablet), and phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm NaF and 1 mm orthovanadate). The lysates were immunoprecipitated with indicated antibodies for 5 h followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for overnight incubation. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline. The immunoprecipitated proteins were released from the beads by boiling in Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) for 5 min and subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were conducted as described by Nelson et al. (22Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Bomsztyk K. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. ARPE-19 cells upon reaching 80–90% confluence were treated with IFN-γ and H2O2 for 1 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and then cross-linked with 1.42% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min followed by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm and incubated for 5 min. After 2 washes with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were scraped in 1 ml of PBS and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was lysed in 1 ml of IP buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1% Triton X-100) containing deacetylase inhibitors (10 mm nicotinamide and 1 μm Trichostatin A), protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics mixture tablet), and phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm NaF and 1 mm orthovanadate). The resulting nuclear pellet was washed once, resuspended in IP buffer, and sonicated for three rounds of 15 pulses each at 50% power output and 90% duty cycle (Branson Sonifer 250, VWR, West Chester, PA). DNA shearing was controlled by extracting the DNA from sheared chromatin and running on an agarose gel to ensure that that DNA fragment size was 300–1000 bp. The sonicated lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and 20 μl was retained as an input control. Two hundred μl of cleared lysate was used for immunoprecipitation with or without the addition of antibodies (5 μg of each antibody per immunoprecipitation reaction) in an ultrasonic water bath for 15 min at 4 °C. The immune complexes were recovered with protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) and washed five times with cold IP buffer without any inhibitors. DNA was precipitated from input control samples by the addition of 100% ethanol. The immunoprecipitated DNA and input DNA were extracted by incubation with 100 μl of 10% Chelex (Bio-Rad) directly with precipitated beads or input DNA pellet and boiled for 10 min to reverse the cross-link. The DNA was purified by removing the Chelex slurry by centrifugation. PCR was performed with the purified DNA, according to instructions, with a High Fidelity PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics) using the following primers: forward, 5′-AAA CTC GAG CCA AAT TCA TCA AGC ACT GCA TTC TTG GCA-3′; reverse, 5′-AAA AAG CTT GGA TCT TTT AAG AGG ACA TTT ACC AGC TAA-3′. Analysis of PCR products was performed on a standard 1% agarose gel. Site-specific Mutagenesis—Point mutations in the FOXO3 binding site were generated by site-specific mutagenesis by overlap PCR extension. The two smaller PCR products were generated using primer A forward, 5′-AAA CTC GAG CCA AAT TCA TCA AGC ACT GCA TTC TTG GCA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TAT CAG AAA CTT TTG CAA AAG CAA TAA AAA ATC AAC CAC A-3′, and primer B forward, 5′-TGT GGT TGA TTT TTT ATT GCT TTT GCA AAA GTT TCT GAT A-3′, and reverse, 5′-AAA AAG CTT GGA TCT TTT AAG AGG ACA TTT ACC AGC TAA-3′. Statistical Analyses—Data are expressed as the mean (±S.D.), and statistical comparisons were done by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons using SAS version 9 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Oxidative Stress Reduces IFN-γ-induced Up-regulation of CFH—The function of CFH is to down-regulate the alternative complement pathway to minimize bystander damage (for review, see Ref. 23Zipfel P.F. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2001; 27: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The expression of CFH is increased by the inflammatory cytokine, IFN-γ (24Ward H.M. Higgs N.M. Blackmore T.K. Sadlon T.A. Gordon D.L. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 508-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The liver is the major source of CFH, but the RPE is a local source of production in the eye (25Mandal M.N. Ayyagari R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 4091-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Incubation of cultured human RPE cells with IFN-γ increased expression of CFH with a maximal effect achieved with 10 ng/ml (Fig. 1a). Exposure of RPE cells to 0.5 or 0.75 mm H2O2 reduced the IFN-γ-induced stimulation of CFH production, with 0.75 mm causing a greater reduction. Serum promotes cell survival and provides some degree of protection from noxious stimuli, but H2O2 had the same suppressive effect on IFN-γ-induced stimulation of CFH production in serum-containing media (Fig. 1b) as seen in serum-free media (Fig. 1a). This effect of H2O2 is due to oxidative stress because it is abrogated in a dose-dependent manner by preincubation with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (Fig. 1, c and d). Consistent with this conclusion, H2O2 and two other causes of oxidative stress, paraquat and FeSO4, at concentrations previously shown not to reduce viability over this time frame (26Lu L. Hackett S.F. Mincey A. Lai H. Campochiaro P.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 206: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), significantly reduced CFH mRNA in RPE cells (Fig. 1e). This could be due to destabilization of the mRNA or reduction in its production. To distinguish between these possibilities we examined the effect of oxidative stress on CFH promoter activity using a dual luciferase reporter assay. The IFN-γ-induced stimulation of CFH promoter activity was significantly reduced by H2O2-induced oxidative stress (Fig. 1f). STAT1 Mediates IFN-γ-induced Stimulation of CFH Promoter Activity—STAT1 is a transcription factor that mediates many effects of IFN-γ (27Dunn G.P. Koebel C.M. Schreiber R.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 836-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). To determine if STAT1 mediates the IFN-γ-induced effects in RPE cells, transfections were done to generate cells with increased levels of STAT1 or dominant-negative STAT1. Cells overexpressing STAT1 showed enhanced IFN-γ-induced stimulation of p3xSTAT1-luc artificial promoter activity, and this was significantly decreased in cells expressing dominant-negative STAT1 (Fig. 2a). Western blots confirmed that, in the presence of IFN-γ, RPE cells expressing dominant-negative STAT1 had substantially less CFH than cells expressing wild type STAT1 (Fig. 2b). This suggests that STAT1 plays an important role in IFN-γ-induced up-regulation of CFH in RPE cells. Oxidative Stress Stimulates Phosphorylation of 46-kDa Jun-N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and Translocation of FOXO Proteins into the Nucleus of RPE Cells—IFN-γ stimulates phosphorylation of STAT1, which allows it to enter the nucleus and stimulate transcription. We postulated that oxidative stress reduces phosphorylation of STAT1 and thereby prevents IFN-γ from increasing levels of CFH in RPE cells. To test this hypothesis, we performed Western blots with an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated STAT1. IFN-γ increased pSTAT1 in RPE cells, and this was not reduced by co-incubation with H2O2; instead the IFN-γ-induced increase was further increased by H2O2 (Fig. 3a). Phosphorylation is an important component of several signaling pathways. Small molecule kinase inhibitors were used to determine if activation of Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or mitogen-activated protein kinase was involved in oxidative stress-mediated down-regulation of CFH expression. In contrast to the mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors PD98059 (17Ceryak S. Zingarello C. O'Brien T. Patierno S.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 255: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and p38 inhibitor (19Lee K.W. Jung J.W. Kang K.S. Lee H.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1030: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and the Src inhibitor PP2 (20Lee M.C. Kim J.Y. Koh W.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which had minimal effect, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (18Hayashi H. Matsuzaki O. Muramatsu S. Tsuchiya Y. Harada T. Suzuki Y. Sugano S. Matsuda A. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 281: 1332-1337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) caused substantial reduction of IFN-γ-induced expression of CFH (Fig. 3b). Treatment with LY294002 also caused significant decrease in CFH promoter activity, and the addition of H2O2 caused a further reduction suggesting an additive effect (Fig. 3c). LY294002 is a specific inhibitor for the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway. Members of the FOXO family of forkhead transcription factors are key downstream targets of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway (28del Peso L. Gonzalez V.M. Hernandez R. Barr F.G. Nunez G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7328-7333Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Zheng W-H. Kar S. Quirion R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39152-39158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In mammals, four highly conserved FOXO family members have been identified and implicated in many cellular processes such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair, and detoxification of reactive oxygen species (29Zheng W-H. Kar S. Quirion R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39152-39158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The effect of LY294002 on CFH expression caused us to investigate for involvement of FOXO proteins. Regulation of FOXO proteins occurs in part through subcellular localization; enhanced activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway results in phosphorylation of FOXO proteins causing nuclear exclusion and altered gene expression (30Matsuzaki H. Ichino A. Hayashi T. Yamamoto T. Kikkawa U. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 138: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We tested whether oxidative stress could override the sequestration of FOXO by Akt. RPE cells transfected with a FOXO1-GFP fusion protein showed diffuse fluorescence throughout their cytoplasm in the presence of 10% serum (Fig. 3d). After treatment with IFN-γ, a fraction of the fluorescently labeled FOXO1 entered the nucleus. However, in response to oxidative stress, nuclear translocation was essentially complete. Because we observed that IFN-γ did not inhibit activation of Akt (Fig. 3a), we postulated that the partial translocation of FOXO1 to the nucleus by IFN-γ was not mediated by changes in the phosphorylation state of Akt. In some tissues oxidative stress has been shown to increase nuclear localization and FOXO transcriptional activity through activation of JNK (31Essers M.A. Weijzen S. de Vries-Smits A.M. Saarloos I. de Ruiter N.D. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4802-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Both Akt and JNK phosphorylate FOXO proteins but do so at different sites. Akt, which is activated by growth factors, phosphorylates FOXO proteins at sites that promote their export from the nucleus, whereas JNK, which is activated by oxidative stress or other causes of stress, phosphorylates FOXO proteins at sites that promote translocation to the nucleus, and when both Akt and JNK are activated, the nuclear localization effect of JNK predominates, which explains why oxidative stress overrides the effect of Akt (31Essers M.A. Weijzen S. de Vries-Smits A.M. Saarloos I. de Ruiter N.D. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4802-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 32Sunayama J. Tsuruta F. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This appears to be the case in RPE cells because incubation with H2O2 caused activation of JNK in the presence and absence of IFN-γ or serum (Fig. 3e), and as we noted previously, expression of CFH was reduced by H2O2 in the presence or absence of serum (Fig. 1b), consistent with the notion that oxidative stress overrides the effect of Akt on FOXO proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2075286779,"Mollusk shell nacre is known for its superior mechanical properties and precisely controlled biomineralization process. However, the question of how mollusks control the morphology of nacre lamellae remains unresolved. Here, a novel 38-kDa extrapallial fluid (EPF) protein, named amorphous calcium carbonate-binding protein (ACCBP), may partially answer this question. Although sequence analysis indicated ACCBP is a member of the acetylcholine-binding protein family, it is actively involved in the shell mineralization process. In vitro, ACCBP can inhibit the growth of calcite and induce the formation of amorphous calcium carbonate. When ACCBP functions were restrained in vivo, the nacre lamellae grew in a screw-dislocation pattern, and low crystallinity CaCO3 precipitated from the EPF. Crystal binding experiments further revealed that ACCBP could recognize different CaCO3 crystal phases and crystal faces. With this capacity, ACCBP could modify the morphology of nacre lamellae by inhibiting the growth of undesired aragonite crystal faces and meanwhile maintain the stability of CaCO3-supersaturated body fluid by ceasing the nucleation and growth of calcite. Furthermore, the crystal growth inhibition capacity of ACCBP was proved to be directly related to its acetylcholine-binding site. Our results suggest that a “safeguard mechanism” of undesired crystal growth is necessary for shell microstructure formation.

Our results suggest that a “safeguard mechanism” of undesired crystal growth is necessary for shell microstructure formation. Many living things have the ability to convert inorganic ions into solid minerals through a process termed biomineralization (1Veis A. The Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Connective Tissues. 1981; (, Elsevier/North-Holland, New York, Oxford)Google Scholar, 2Simkiss K. Wilbur K.M. Biomineralization: Cell Biology and Mineral Deposition. 1989; (, Academic Press, San Diego, London)Google Scholar). The biogenetic solid minerals, also known as biominerals, form external and internal hard tissues (e.g. otoliths, shells, and bones) that carry out diverse functions. Among these biomineralization products, the aragonite layer of molluscan shell (also called nacre or mother of pearl) is remarkable for its unique microstructure and superior mechanical properties (3Lowenstam H.A.

Unlike other biogenetic mineral structures, nacre is not embedded in a tissue or layers of cells. Instead, a thin layer of fluid filling the space between the mantle epithelium and the shell, namely the extrapallial fluid (EPF), 4The abbreviations used are: EPF, extrapallial fluid; ACC, amorphous calcium carbonate; ACCBP, amorphous calcium carbonate-binding protein; α7 nAChRs, α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; ACh, acetylcholine; rACCBP, recombinant ACCBP; RA, rhodamine; α-Bgt, α-bungarotoxin; TFMS, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; BSA, bovine serum albumin. is employed as the final medium of nacre calcification (2Simkiss K.

In this aqueous microenvironment, inorganic ions, including Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42−, CO32−, and HCO3−, are transported from the external environment and achieve an appropriate supersaturation of CaCO3 necessary for shell crystal growth (5Crenshaw M.A. Biol. Bull. 1972; 143: 506-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pietrzak J.E. Bates J.M. Scott R.M. Hydrobiologia. 1976; 50: 89-93Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, various organic macromolecules, including proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids, are secreted by mantle cells or transported from elsewhere to the EPF (7Misogianes M.J. Chasteen N.D. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8Marsh M.E. Sass R.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1983; 226: 193-203Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Wilbur K.M. Bernhardt A.M. Biol.

These macromolecules are thought to also be responsible for transporting the inorganic ions and stabilizing this CaCO3-supersaturated fluid (10Nair P.S. Robinson W.E. Biol.

The shell matrix proteins (the proteins found in the shell) are also in the EPF and self- or co-assemble to form the crystal deposition framework and initiate crystallization (4Weiner S. Gotliv B.

Because all of these complex processes occur in an extracelluar liquid, nacre mineralization provides a useful model of formation of a material with intricate nano-architectures in a mild condition. For a long time, it was believed that the matrix proteins played a dominant role in directing the highly organized nanocomposites of CaCO3 crystals to form the layered structure of nacre (2Simkiss K. Wilbur K.M. Biomineralization: Cell Biology and Mineral Deposition. 1989; (, Academic Press, San Diego, London)Google Scholar, 14Marin F. Luquet G. Comptes Rendus Palevol. 2004; 3: 469-492Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 15Zhang C. Zhang R. Mar. Biotechnol. (NY). 2006; 8: 572-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, although matrix proteins extracted from nacre can induce the formation of aragonite in vitro like that in vivo (16Falini G. Albeck S. Weiner S. Addadi L. Science. 1996; 271: 67-69Crossref Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 17Belcher A.M. Wu X.H. Christensen R.J. Hansma P.K. Stucky G.D. Morse D.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 56-58Crossref Scopus (1067) Google Scholar), the exceedingly orderly morphology of nacre lamellae cannot be reproduced in vitro. In fact, previous research revealed that once nucleation took place, the growth of the nacre lamellae would start, even in an inorganic environment (18Giles R. Manne S. Mann S. Morse D.E. Stucky G.D. Hansma P.K. Biol. Bull. 1995; 188: 8-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of the macromolecules of the EPF, nacreous lamellae grow by following the pattern of inorganic aragonite instead of forming the layered structure of nacre. In this case, it is reasonable to predict that besides keeping the stability of the CaCO3-supersaturated microenvironment, some macromolecules of the EPF are also directly involved in modifying the morphology of shell crystals. However, because of the difficulties in protein purification and in vivo functional identification, although some calcium-binding proteins were found in the EPF (11Hattan S.J. Laue T.M. Chasteen N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4461-4468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Yin Y. Huang J. Paine M.L. Reinhold V.N. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10720-10731Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), how the macromolecules maintain the stability of the EPF and affect nacre lamellae growth was unknown. In the present study, a protein was extracted from the EPF of Pinctada fucata through a new method. A series of in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that this protein can inhibit undesired crystal growth and play a key role in stabilizing the CaCO3-supersaturated body fluid and forming the exceedingly orderly microstructure of nacre. Animals—The oyster, P. fucata, was purchased from Guofa Pearl Farm, Beihai, Guangxi Province, China. Animals were maintained in glass aquariums filled with aerated artificial seawater (Sude Instant Sea Salt, 3% at 20 °C) for 3 days prior to experimentation. Extrapallial Fluid Extraction and Protein Purification—The extrapallial fluid (EPF) was extracted by inserting a 0.8 × 30-mm needle into the central extrapallial space and sucking the fluid gently into a sterile syringe. The needle tip was carefully kept in contact with the inner shell surface to avoid contamination by extraneous water or other body fluids. Samples collected (∼50-100 μl per oyster) were immediately transferred to 15 ml of sterile centrifuge tubes and held on ice. After extraction, fluids were centrifuged for 20 min at 1500 × g and 4 °C. Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) was synthesized according to the method of Koga et al. (20Koga N. Nakagoe Y.Z. Tanaka H. Thermochimica Acta. 1998; 318: 239-244Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar) with some modification. Equimolar sodium carbonate (0.1 m) and calcium chloride (0.1 m) solutions were mixed with vigorous stirring at 0-4 °C. Sodium hydroxide (1 m) was added to obtain mixed solutions within pH 11.2-11.4. Then the precipitated colloidal phase was centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 × g and 4 °C to separate the ACC. To verify that only pure ACC existed, the precipitate was washed with acetone, dried in a vacuum desiccator for 1 day, and identified via x-ray diffraction. The separated ACC was incubated with EPF at a ratio of 1:10 (w/v) for 3 h at 4 °C. Then the mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 1500 × g and 4 °C, and washed with a large volume of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 0.5 m NaCl. After centrifugation, 0.5 m EDTA (pH 8.0) was added to dissolve the ACC. The supernatant was dialyzed exhaustively against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and concentrated by ultrafiltration with a Millipore Amicon Ultra-4 (molecular weight cutoff 10 kDa). For further purification, the concentrated supernatant was injected onto an anion exchange column (Protein Pak™ DEAE 8HR AP-1 Mini-Column, Φ5 × 100 mm) and a reversed-phase column (GRACEVYDAC 214TPC4 Column, Φ4.6 × 250 mm) connected to a HPLC system (Waters). N-terminal Sequencing of ACCBP—ACCBP was electrotransferred from the SDS-PAGE gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and its N terminus was sequenced via Edman degradation (Applied Biosystem, Procise 491). Identification of the cDNA Sequence of ACCBP—Total RNA was extracted from the pearl oyster P. fucata with a RNAzol RNA Isolation Kit (Biotecx, Houston, TX) and 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE were performed with a SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech) and Advantage 2 cDNA Polymerase Mix (Clontech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A degenerate sense primer (5′-AAR TGY GAY TAY CCN GAR GC-3′) was designed according to residues 1-7 of ACCBP (KCDYPEA) and used for 3′-RACE in combination with the 3′-RACE primer UPM (Clontech). According to the cDNA sequence acquired from the 3′-RACE, a gene-specific antisense primer (5′-CTT GCC TTT TGA ATG GGG AC-3′) was synthesized and used for 5′-RACE in combination with the 5′-RACE primer UPM (Clontech). Gene Expression Analysis by RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the mantle, viscus, adductor muscle, gill, and hemocytes of adult individuals of P. fucata as described above. An equal quantity (2 μg) of RNA from different tissues was reverse-transcribed into cDNA with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). GAPDH was used as a positive control for cDNA preparation and amplified with the primer pair of gapdhF (5′-GCC GAG TAT GTG GTA GAA TC-3′) and gap-dhR (5′-CAC TGT TTT CTG GGT AGC TG-3′). ACCBP was amplified with the primer pair of accbpF (5′-AAA TTC CTG CTG GAT GAC TAT G-3′) and accbpR (5′-AAC GGT CCA CCA TCT TTG TTC C-3′). A negative control was carried out in the absence of cDNA template to examine the cross contamination of the samples. PCR consisted of 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were subcloned and verified by sequencing. Preparation of Wild Type rACCBP—The gene coding sequence of ACCBP was subcloned into the expression vector pPIC9K (without the signal sequence and with a His tag at the C terminus) and overexpressed in yeast, Pichia pastoris GS115 according to the Invitrogen manual. After 2 days of induction, the medium was collected, concentrated, and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. The protein was purified with Ni-NTA agarose following the Qiagen manual and then dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The yield was about 3 mg/liter. Tissue Distribution Analysis by Western Blotting—Polyclonal antibody was prepared by immunizing rabbits with rACCBP and purified with HiTrap Protein A HP by following the Amersham Biosciences manual. Tissues, i.e. mantle, viscus, adductor muscle, and gill, were homogenized and the total soluble proteins were extracted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Hemolymph and extrapallial fluid were extracted directly from the pearl oyster P. fucata. Shell powder was treated with 0.5 m EDTA for 3 days and the EDTA soluble and insoluble shell matrix was separated by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Protein samples with an equal quantity (50 μg) were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked overnight and treated with a 1:2000 dilution of antibody against ACCBP. It was then washed exhaustively four times, treated with a 1:500 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody, washed exhaustively four times, and finally visualized with NBT/BCIP. Chemical Deglycosylation—ACCBP and rACCBP were lyophilized overnight. Deglycosylation was performed on the freeze-dried sample with a GlycoProfile IV chemical deglycosylation kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were then extensively dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, in dialysis tubing (GeBA) with a molecular size cutoff of 3,500 Da. Western Blotting with Concanavalin A Probe—ACCBP and rACCBP were run on a 12% gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked overnight and treated with 10 μg/ml Biotin-Concanavalin A (Sigma). It was then washed exhaustively four times, treated with a 1:100 dilution of avidin-HRP, washed exhaustively four times, and finally visualized with an enhanced DAB kit. Protein Labeling with Rhodamine-α-bungarotoxin (RA-α-Bgt)—ACCBP or rACCBP was mixed with an equimolar amount of RA-α-Bgt (Sigma) in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. For rACCBP, the mixture was held at 4 °C for more than 1 h. For ACCBP, the mixture was held at 4 °C for over 24 h. Protein Labeling with Rhodamine—1 mg of rACCBP was dialyzed against 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.3) and concentrated to 10 mg/ml. 0.5 mg of 5-TAMRA, S.E. (Promega) was dissolved in 0.05 ml of Me2SO immediately before the reaction. While the protein solution was being stirred, 0.01 ml of the reactive dye solution was added slowly. Then the reaction was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with continuous stirring, and the reaction was stopped by adding 0.01 ml of freshly prepared 1.5 m hydroxylamine, pH 8.5. Finally, dialysis against a large volume of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) was used to separate the conjugate from the unreacted labeling reagent. 50 μg of ACCBP was labeled as above. The dosage of other reagents was reduced accordingly. Injection of Antibody against ACCBP into the Extrapallial Space—Oysters with shells of about 4-6 cm in diameter and 30-40 g in wet weight were held in a tank for 7 days prior to use. The purified antibody against ACCBP (anti-ACCBP) was injected into the center of the extrapallial space through the mantle with a microsyringe at dosages of 0.5 μg and 1.5 μg per gram of wet weight per day. Each group contained 5 specimens. The same dosage of preimmune rabbit serum was used as a control. The oysters were sacrificed after 5 days, and the shells were separated, washed with Milli-Q water, and immersed in 5% NaOH for 24 h to remove the organic components attached to the surfaces. Then the shells were extensively washed with Milli-Q water, air-dried, sealed, and stored at -20 °C until being used. In Vitro Crystal Growth Experiments—Saturated Ca(HCO3)2 solution was prepared by following the method of Xu et al. (21Xu G.F. Yao N. Aksay I.A. Groves J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11977-11985Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar) with some modification. CO2 gas was bubbled into the mixture of CaCO3 and Milli-Q deionized water for 4 h. Excess solid CaCO3 was removed via filtration, and the filtrate was aerated with CO2 for another hour. The calcium concentration of the solution was about 8.5 mm, as determined by EDTA titration, and the pH 6.2. The experiments were carried out in 96-well COSMO multidishes with cleaned glass slides or silicon wafers on the bottom of each well. Saturated Ca(HCO3)2 solution and protein solution were mixed in each well to a final volume of 100 μl with a calcium concentration of 8 mm. 100 μl of Milli-Q water was introduced to the wells next to the samples to trap the CO2 that diffused from the bicarbonate solution. Water or the same concentration of BSA was chosen as negative controls. The multidishes were placed in a sealed system at room temperature. After 48 h, the glass slides or silicon wafers were lightly rinsed with Milli-Q water, dried, and observed by S.E. and Raman spectrum. For the FTIR spectrum, the precipitate of each well was collected and dried under vacuum. For the crystal growth experiment performed with the mixture of ACCBP and α-Bgt (molar ratio: 1:2), the proteins were incubated 24 h in advance. The mixture of BSA and ACCBP at the same concentration was used as a control. Crystal Growth Inhibition Experiments—The saturated Ca(HCO3)2 solution was prepared as above. The solution, about 200 μl per well, was introduced into a 96-well COSMO multidish with glass slides on the bottom, and 100 μl of Milli-Q water was introduced into the wells next to the samples to trap CO2. After 30 min, the wells were inspected under an optical microscope (Leica DMIRB). When rhombohedral crystal seeds became visible, pictures were taken, and the relative positions were marked. Then 5 μl of protein solution was added to give a final concentration of 0.2 μm, and the multidish was placed into a sealed system at room temperature. Pictures of the crystals were taken at the marked place after 24 h. Crystal Binding Experiments—The CaCO3 crystals were synthesized as in the crystal growth inhibition experiments, except that the multidish was placed in a sealed system at 40 °C to induce the formation of both calcite and aragonite. 24 h later, the glass slides were lightly rinsed with Milli-Q water and air-dried. The crystal polymorphs were determined by Renishaw Raman Spectroscopy. The labeled proteins were diluted with CaCO3-saturated Tris-HCl buffer (10 mm pH 7.5, prepared by mixing 1 g of reagent grade calcite with 100 ml of Tris-HCl buffer and stirring for 24 h) to a final concentration of 0.1 μm and incubated with the glass slides for 1 h at room temperature. Then the glass slides were rinsed with CaCO3-saturated Tris-HCl buffer and Milli-Q water and air-dried. Slides were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMR). Images were collected with a Leica CCD 300F camera. The exposure time for the fluorescence images was set to 6.5 s. To confirm the binding patterns of different proteins, the crystal binding experiments were repeated at least three times for each kind of protein. When the interaction of shell nacre and rhodamine-labeled ACCBP (RA-ACCBP) was tested, the inner surface of the shell nacre was mechanically cleaved into small pieces (approx. 8 × 8 × 1 mm). In the group of normal nacre, the nacre pieces were incubated in the RA-ACCBP solution together with some synthesized calcite (Sigma). The incubation lasted until fluorescence appeared on all the synthesized calcite. Before observing the inner surface of the nacre under the fluorescence microscope, some of the calcite crystals were carefully dropped on it as positive controls. The nacre pieces from all the specimens of each group were tested. The total examined surface area of normal nacre (and other groups) is more than 6 cm2. The exposure time for these fluorescence images was set to 600 ms. Raman Spectroscopy—The glass slides or silicon wafers were first observed under reflected white light with a Leica microscope at a magnification of ×500. After focusing on a single crystal, the light source of the microscope was transferred to 514-nm diode laser. The spectra were scanned 3 × 20 s in the range of 100-1200 cm-1 with a Renishaw Raman imaging microscope. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy Analysis—Precipitate was powdered and mixed with anhydrous KBr. The mixture was pressed into a 13-mm diameter pellet. FTIR spectra were obtained with a Nicolet560 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Scanning Electron Microscopy—The silicon wafers or incised shells were sputter-coated with gold and analyzed with a FEI Sirion2000 scanning electron microscope, which was operated at 10 kV and equipped with a Kevex energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer for element analysis of crystals. Extraction and Characterization of ACCBP—The stability of the EPF is demonstrated by its CaCO3 crystalline inhibition ability. It has been shown that the organic components of the EPF, even at high dilution, can effectively decrease the rate of CaCO3 crystallization (9Wilbur K.M. Bernhardt A.M. Biol. Bull. 1984; 166: 251-259Crossref Google Scholar). During our research on EPF, we found that EPF can retard further crystallization of the synthesized amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), which is the most unstable form of CaCO3 (22Ogino T. Suzuki T. Sawada K. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta. 1987; 51: 2757-2767Crossref Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 23Clarkson J.R. Price T.J. Adams C.J. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1992; 88: 243-249Crossref Google Scholar). To investigate the abnormal stability of ACC, we separated ACC from the EPF by centrifugation and decalcified the ACC with EDTA. SDS-PAGE analysis of the EDTA-soluble component revealed an obvious ∼38-kDa protein band that could not be observed in the SDS-PAGE of the EPF (Fig. 1). This specifically enriched protein was named ACCBP (amorphous calcium carbonate-binding protein). When the HPLC-purified ACCBP was run on a SDS-PAGE gel under unreduced conditions, a band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼76 kDa could be observed (Fig. 1). This result suggested that under physiological conditions ACCBP might exist as a homodimer. Partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of ACCBP (KCDYPEAKLLKFLLDDYEKLVRPVP) was obtained by Western blotting and Edman degradation. On the basis of the N-terminal sequence, 3′-RACE and 5′-RACE were performed to reveal the cDNA sequence of ACCBP (GenBank™ accession no. DQ473430). The 930-base pair cDNA sequence encoded a single protein of 240 amino acids and a typical transcription termination signal (AATAAA), which confirmed the integrity of the cDNA sequence (Fig. 2). The mature protein starts with Lys at position 25 and has a predicted molecular weight of 24,389. The sequence analysis indicated that ACCBP is an acidic protein with a theoretical pI of 4.56 and is rich in acidic residues (Asp + Glu nearly 16%). However, compared with many matrix proteins purified from the shell matrix of bivalves, such as caspartin (13Marin F. Amons R. Guichard N. Stigter M. Hecker A. Luquet G. Layrolle P. Alcaraz G. Riondet C. Westbroek P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33895-33908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), ACCBP is not a typical Asx-rich protein, and the mol percentage of positively charged residues is high (Arg + His + Lys nearly 11%). In fact, except for the most abundant residues (Asp and Leu, nearly 11%), the amino acid composition of ACCBP is not significantly biased to any residue. The BLAST search against GenBank™ revealed that ACCBP has 30% sequence identity with the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) of Drosophila melanogaster (Fig. 2). ACCBP has the residues which are conserved in nAChRs, especially those considered to be involved in acetylcholine (ACh)-binding, as well as the characteristically conserved cysteine loop region between Cys133 and Cys145 and the typical disulfide bond between adjacent cysteine residues Cys195 and Cys196 (24Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). There have been reports about the soluble analogues of the extracellular domain of the α7 nAChR (25Smit A.B. Syed N.I. Schaap D. van Minnen J. Klumperman J. Kits K.S.

Nature. 2001; 411: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). AChBP is believed to actively modulate neuronal synaptic transmission. Unlike the α7 nAChR and AChBP, ACCBP can form a homodimer via an intermolecular disulfide bond between Cys2 residues (Figs. 1 and 2) and has two potential glycosylation sites at Asn29 and Asn184. Western blotting of ACCBP in different tissues reveals that ACCBP mainly exists in the hemolymph and extrapallial fluid, and some is detected in the adductor muscle (Fig. 3A). Although RT-PCR analysis of ACCBP gene expression demonstrates that ACCBP is expressed in the mantle, the adductor muscle, and the viscus (Fig. 4), no positive signal was detected in the mantle and the viscus by Western blotting of soluble extracts of the tissue (Fig. 3A). However, ACCBP was weakly detected on Western blots of extracts of mantle and viscus, which were enriched for ACCBP with ACC (data not shown). This phenomenon might be explained in this way: immediately after ACCBP is synthesized in these tissues, it is secreted into the body fluid; this makes its content in these tissues too low to be detected on Western blots with equal quantities of total extract proteins.FIGURE 4RT-PCR analysis of ACCBP in different tissues. RT-PCR was performed on RNA prepared from viscus, mantle, gill, adductor muscle, and hemocytes. GAPDH was used as the positive control.

We found that just 0.2 μm ACCBP can totally inhibit the formation of calcite. The infrared spectra of all precipitates show broad v2 and v1 absorption bands of ACC at 864 and 1070 cm-1, respectively, and the split of the v3 band around 1450 cm-1, which indicates that"

https://openalex.org/W2021857072,"Tankyrase1 is a multifunctional poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase that can localize to telomeres through its interaction with the shelterin component TRF1. Tankyrase1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates TRF1 in vitro, and its nuclear overexpression leads to loss of TRF1 and telomere elongation, suggesting that tankyrase1 is a positive regulator of telomere length. In agreement with this proposal, we show that tankyrase1 RNA interference results in telomere shortening proportional to the level of knockdown. Furthermore, we show that a tankyrase1-resistant form of TRF1 enforced normal telomere length control, indicating that tankyrase1 is not required downstream of TRF1 in this pathway. Thus, in human cells, tankyrase1 appears to act upstream of TRF1, promoting telomere elongation through the removal of TRF1. This pathway appears absent from mouse cells. We show that murine TRF1, which lacks the canonical tankyrase1-binding site, is not a substrate for tankyrase1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)sylation in vitro. Furthermore, overexpression of tankyrase1 in mouse nuclei did not remove TRF1 from telomeres and had no detectable effect on other components of mouse shelterin. We propose that the tankyrase1-controlled telomere extension is a human-specific elaboration that allows additional control over telomere length in telomerase positive cells.

We propose that the tankyrase1-controlled telomere extension is a human-specific elaboration that allows additional control over telomere length in telomerase positive cells. Telomeres can be elongated by the telomere-specific reverse transcriptase telomerase and shortened through the effects of DNA replication and nucleolytic attack. The TTAGGG repeat array of vertebrate telomeres has a species-specific length setting, suggesting that these forces are balanced in the germ line. Telomere length control has been primarily studied in human tumor cells that express telomerase (reviewed in Ref. 1Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 177-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Such cells often maintain the length of their telomeres within a set range. This telomere length homeostasis is achieved through a negative feedback loop involving shelterin, the telomere-specific protein complex (2de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Shelterin is comprised of six proteins (TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TPP1, TIN2, and Rap1) whose abundance at chromosome ends is dictated by the length of the duplex telomeric repeat array. All shelterin components behave as negative regulators of telomere elongation by telomerase. Inhibition of TRF1, TPP1, TIN2, and POT1 results in telomere elongation, whereas overexpression of several shelterin components shortens the length of the telomeres. Telomere healing experiments demonstrated that cells have the ability to monitor and regulate telomerase at individual telomeres, and tethering of TRF1 at subtelomeric sites showed that TRF1 can modulate telomere length in cis. These findings have resulted in a model for shelterin-dependent telomere length homeostasis whereby long telomeres contain more shelterin and thus have a diminished chance of being elongated further by telomerase. A key player in this negative feedback loop is POT1, whose binding to the single-stranded telomeric DNA appears to block telomerase in vivo (3Liu D. Safari A. O'Connor M.S. Chan D.W. Laegeler A.

Although tankyrase1 is not a core component of shelterin, it can bind to a short motif in the N-terminal acidic domain of TRF1 (12Sbodio J.I. Chi N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31887-31892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and PARsylates TRF1 in vitro, inhibiting its ability to bind to telomeric DNA (13Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Upon overexpression of tankyrase1 in the nucleus, TRF1 is removed from telomeres and degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (13Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 14Chang W. Dynek J.N. Smith S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Concomitant with the loss of TRF1, such cells display a telomere elongation phenotype that requires the catalytic activity of the PARP domain of tankyrase1 (15Cook B.D. Dynek J.N. Chang W. Shostak G. Smith S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 16Seimiya H. Muramatsu Y. Ohishi T. Tsuruo T.

TRF1 can be protected from the effect of tankyrase1 by TIN2, which forms a ternary complex with tankyrase1 and TRF1 and blocks the PARsylation of TRF1 in vitro (18Ye J.Z. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). When TIN2 is inhibited in vivo, TRF1 appears more sensitive to the endogenous tankyrase1, and telomere elongation occurs. Collectively, these results implicate tankyrase1 as a positive regulator of telomere elongation by telomerase. Several approaches have been used to provide further evidence for such a role of endogenous tankyrase1. PARP inhibitors were shown to induce telomere shortening, but it has been difficult to ascribe this phenotype to inhibition of tankyrase1 rather than one of the other PARPs (16Seimiya H. Muramatsu Y. Ohishi T. Tsuruo T. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 25-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Dominant negative alleles of tankyrase1 have largely failed to yield the expected telomere shortening phenotypes (15Cook B.D. Dynek J.N. Chang W. Shostak G. Smith S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 17Smith S. de Lange T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1299-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), although success with one allele has been reported (16Seimiya H. Muramatsu Y. Ohishi T. Tsuruo T. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 25-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Here we address this issue further by examining the telomere dynamics of cells targeted with tankyrase1 shRNAs and through the use of a tankyrase1-resistant allele of TRF1. Tankyrase1 shRNA and Telomere Length Analysis—We generated four tankyrase1 shRNAs in pSUPER-retro (Oligo-Engine) and performed retroviral infections in BJ-hTERT cells as described previously (19Karlseder J. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Science. 2002; 295: 2446-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The sequences of the shRNA targets are as follows: sh1, 5′-GGCAGTGGCAGTAACAATT-3′; sh3, 5′-GAGGTTGTGAGTCTGTTAT-3′; sh4, 5′-GCGCTGATCCTACGTTAGT-3′; sh5, 5′-GCGTCGCTCTCAGCATCAT-3′. Total cellular proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies to tankyrase1 (465), and the relative tankyrase1 protein levels were quantified by densitometry using the AlphaImager 2200 program (Alpha Innotech). For telomere length analysis, the cells were harvested, made into DNA agarose plugs, digested with AluI and MboI, separated on a 0.6% agarose gel, and transferred to a Hybond membrane for hybridization using an 800-bp telomeric DNA probe from pSP73Sty11 labeled by Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dCTP. We exposed the blot to a PhosphorImager screen and quantified telomeric DNA signals using Image-Quant. The rates of telomere shortening were calculated by linear regression. Generation of hTRF1ΔTank—hTRF1ΔTank (hTRF1R13A/G14R) was made in the Gateway pENTR vector (Invitrogen) using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A Clonase reaction was performed to transfer hTRF1ΔTank to the following destination vectors: pDEST14 for in vitro translation, pLPC MYC for 293T transfection and for retroviral infection, and pDEST10 for baculovirus production. Far Western Analysis—Far Western assays were carried out as described previously (20Ye J.Z. Donigian J.R. Van Overbeek M. Loayza D. Luo Y. Krutchinsky A.N. Chait B.T. de Lange T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47264-47271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) Two micrograms of purified protein derived from insect cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then blotted onto nitrocellulose. The blots were incubated in blocking buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 5% milk) for 3 h at 4 °C. Following the blocking step, the blots were probed overnight at 4 °C with 35S-labeled in vitro translated protein prepared using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) (a 50-μl reaction mixture in 5 ml of blocking buffer). The next morning, the blots were washed five times every 30 min in wash buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.25% milk) and then incubated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min. The blots were exposed on a PhosphorImager screen overnight. Transfection and Immunoprecipitation—293T cell transfection and immunoprecipitation was done as described previously (18Ye J.Z. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We plated human 293T cells (5–6 × 106) and transfected them 20–24 h later by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method using 10–20 μg of plasmid DNA per 10 cm dish. We changed the medium after 12 h and collected cells 24–30 h after transfection. For immunoprecipitations, we dislodged 293T cells from the dish by flushing with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), collected them by centrifugation, and lysed them in ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture). After 10 min on ice, we added an equal volume of ice-cold water and mixed thoroughly. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. The prepared lysates were incubated with 1 μg of MYC 9E10 mouse monoclonal antibody for 5–6 h at 4 °C, nutating. During the final hour, we added 30 μl (settled volume) of protein G-Sepharose beads (preblocked overnight with 10% bovine serum albumin in PBS) to each tube. We washed the beads three times with lysis buffer, eluted proteins with Laemmli loading buffer, and analyzed them by SDS-PAGE. In Vitro PARP Assay—The in vitro tankyrase1 PARP assay was performed as described (13Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. We incubated 4 μg of proteins purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells or Escherichia coli cells (GST-mTRF1) with [32P]β-NAD+ (1.3 μm) at 25 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by adding ice-cold trichloroacetic acid to 25%. After 10 min on ice, we collected proteins by microcentrifugation (10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C). The pellets were rinsed gently with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and dissolved in sample loading buffer (1 m Tris-base, 12% SDS, 0.2 m dithiothreitol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). We separated the samples by SDS-PAGE and analyzed them by autoradiography and Coomassie Blue staining. Transient Transfection and Indirect Immunofluorescence—FLAG-NLS-tagged tankyrase1 (FN-tankyrase1) was transfected into HeLa1.2.11 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or into NIH 3T3 cells and MEFs by nucleofection (Amaxa) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were fixed 48 h after transfection for 10 min at room temperature with PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 10 min in PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Nonspecific interactions were blocked by incubation for 30 min in PBS with 0.2% cold water fish gelatin and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (PBG). Thereafter, cells were incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The following antibodies were used: tankyrase1, 465; MYC 9E10 (Calbiochem); FLAG M2 (Sigma); mTRF1 644; mTIN2 1447; 4J. R. Donigian and T. de Lange, unpublished data. and mRap1 1252 (21Celli G. de Lange T. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2005; 7: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times for 5 min using PBG and incubated with rhodamine- or fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies in PBG (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine). DNA was stained with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole. Tankyrase1 shRNAs Affect Telomerase-mediated Telomere Elongation—To further address the role of tankyrase1 as a positive regulator of telomere length, we examined the telomere length of cells treated with tankyrase1 shRNAs. Since tankyrase1 deficiency is known to induce a mitotic arrest (22Chang P. Jacobson M.K. Mitchison T.J. Nature. 2004; 432: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Dynek J.N. Smith S. Science. 2004; 304: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and thus would be incompatible with long term culturing, we aimed for shRNAs that would generate partial knockdown. We tested shRNAs for the residual tankyrase1 protein levels by quantitative Western blotting (Fig. 1, A and D) and identified two shRNAs that lowered the tankyrase1 level about 2-fold. A third shRNA had a very modest effect, and a fourth shRNA did not affect tankyrase1 and served as a control. None of these shRNAs affected the proliferation of the cells (Fig. 1B). Since the knockdown of tankyrase1 is partial, we anticipated that its effect would be most easily monitored under conditions where telomerase is not in excess since high levels of telomerase can mask regulatory pathways (24Cristofari G. Lingner J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Our BJ-hTERT cells showed gradual telomere shortening despite the fact they are expressing telomerase. Their shortening rate was 25–30 bp/end/PD, which is significantly less than for telomerase-negative BJ cells (80 bp/end/PD) (19Karlseder J. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Science. 2002; 295: 2446-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), indicating that telomerase is active at a significant but low level. If tankyrase1 contributes to the telomerase pathway in these cells, we would expect to detect an increase in the shortening rate from 25–30 bp/end/PD to the maximal rate of 80 bp/end/PD. To be able to determine such changes accurately, BJ-hTERT cells expressing the various shRNAs were cultured in parallel with the vector control for ∼130 PDs, and the telomere shortening rates were determined based on multiple genomic blots at various PDs (Fig. 1, C and D). The results indicated that tankyrase1 shRNAs sh1 and sh5 resulted in a significant increase in the shortening rate to 43 ± 2.2 and 46 ± 2.5 bp/end/PD, respectively. The less effective sh3 had a minor effect (shortening at 35 ± 0.5 bp/end/PD), and as expected, cells expressing the ineffective sh4 had a similar shortening rate as the vector control cells (31 ± 3.1 bp/end/PD). Together with previous data indicating that tankyrase1 does not affect telomere dynamics in telomerase-negative cells (15Cook B.D. Dynek J.N. Chang W. Shostak G. Smith S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), our results confirm the role for tankyrase1 as a positive regulator of the telomerase pathway. Mutation of the Tankyrase1-binding Motif of TRF1—In the simplest model for the effect of tankyrase1 on telomere maintenance, the enzyme binds and PARsylates TRF1, removing TRF1 from telomeres. Here, tankyrase1 only acts upstream of TRF1 and is not required for the ability of TRF1 to function as a negative regulator of telomere length. However, the data do not exclude the possibility that tankyrase1 may also have a role downstream of TRF1, affecting the negative regulation of telomere length by TRF1 (18Ye J.Z. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, we generated a TRF1 mutant that lacks a functional tankyrase1 interaction motif and determined whether it was still capable of negatively regulating telomere length. In characterizing the minimal tankyrase-binding motif, it was shown that the first residue in the hexapeptide RXXADG is critical for tankyrase binding, whereas substitution of the second residue had no effect on binding (12Sbodio J.I. Chi N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31887-31892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, a mutation was made in the N-terminal 13RGCADG18 motif of hTRF1 by converting arginine 13 to an alanine (Fig. 2A). Additionally, glycine 14 was inadvertently mutated to an arginine. The ability of this hTRF1ΔTank protein to bind tankyrase1 was tested by far Western assay. Baculovirus-derived TIN2, tankyrase1, and Rap1 (as a negative control) were probed with in vitro translated 35S-labeled hTRF1 and hTRF1ΔTank. The results showed that wild type hTRF1 was able to bind tankyrase1, whereas hTRF1ΔTank failed to do so. On the other hand, the mutation did not affect the TRF1-TIN2 association, as demonstrated by the robust signal in the TIN2 lane for both wild type hTRF1 and the mutant (Fig. 2B). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments also indicated that hTRF1ΔTank no longer bound tankyrase1. MYC-tagged hTRF1 and hTRF1ΔTank were transiently co-transfected with FN-tankyrase1 into 293T cells, and TRF1 was precipitated from the cells using an antibody against MYC. The immunoblot shows that wild type hTRF1 was able to pull down tankyrase1, whereas hTRF1ΔTank failed to do so (Fig. 2C). hTRF1ΔTank Is Resistant to Tankyrase1 Activity in Vitro and in Vivo—We next tested whether the hTRF1ΔTank mutant could be PARsylated by tankyrase1 in an in vitro PARP assay (Fig. 3). The PARsylation of hTRF1ΔTank by tankyrase1 was reduced by 4–5-fold when compared with wild type hTRF1 (22 ± 7.6% of wild type in three experiments). The discrepancy between the ability of hTRF1ΔTank to bind tankyrase1 and to be modified by tankyrase1 may lie in the sensitivity of the assays used. It is possible that hTRF1ΔTank can still loosely associate with tankyrase1 outside of its acidic domain (25Seimiya H. Muramatsu Y. Smith S. Tsuruo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1944-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), allowing for modest PARsylation of hTRF1ΔTank. In fact, this is the case with chicken TRF1, which binds tankyrase1 although it lacks the RXXADG tankyrase-binding motif (26De Rycker M. Venkatesan R.N. Wei C. Price C.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Finally, we tested the ability of hTRF1ΔTank to resist removal from the telomere in the presence of excess nuclear tankyrase1 in vivo. HeLa cells expressing MYC-tagged hTRF1 or hTRF1ΔTank were transiently transfected with FN-tankyrase1, and the removal of TRF1 was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence. As expected, hTRF1 was no longer detectable at telomeres in the nuclei that expressed tankyrase1 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, hTRF1ΔTank retained its punctuate pattern in tankyrase1-expressing cells (Fig. 4B). We conclude that hTRF1ΔTank has largely lost tankyrase1 interaction in vitro and in vivo. hTRF1ΔTank Behaves as a Negative Regulator of Telomere Length—To evaluate the effect of the diminished tankyrase1 interaction on the telomere length regulatory activity of TRF1, we analyzed telomere length in BJ-hTERT and HTC75 cells overexpressing wild type hTRF1 and hTRF1ΔTank. Both proteins were expressed at the same level (Fig. 5A). Their overexpression was such that only ∼15% of the total TRF1 in the cells was derived from the endogenous (wild type) locus. hTRF1ΔTank had no effect on the viability of the cells, and they proliferated at the same rate as cells expressing hTRF1 or the vector control (Fig. 5B and data not shown). As seen in the tankyrase1 shRNA experiment, the BJ-hTERT vector control cells experienced mild telomere shortening (21 ± 9.5 bp/end/PD), whereas the HTC75 vector control cells remained at a stable telomere length setting. Overexpression of hTRF1 led to telomere shortening at a rate of 66 ± 3.5 bp/end/PD in BJ-hTERT cells and 11 ± 1.0 bp/end/PD in HTC75 cells (Fig. 5, C and D; data not shown). A similar shortening phenotype was evident for the cells expressing hTRF1ΔTank, which induced a shortening rate of 68 ± 7.0 bp/end/PD in BJ-hTERT cells and 12 ± 0.5 bp/end/PD in HTC75 cells (Fig. 5, C and D; data not shown). This result implies that diminished recruitment of tankyrase1 does not have a strong impact on the ability of TRF1 to negatively regulate telomere length. Thus, tankyrase1 appears to primarily act upstream of TRF1 in the telomere length regulation pathway. Mouse TRF1 Does Not Interact with Tankyrase1 in Vitro and in Vivo—Interestingly, the N terminus of mouse TRF1 lacks the RGCADG motif (Fig. 2A) and does not bind tankyrase1 (12Sbodio J.I. Chi N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31887-31892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This would suggest that the wild type mTRF1 would resemble the hTRF1ΔTank mutant. To test this idea, we asked whether full-length mTRF1 could interact with and be modified by tankyrase1. Human and mouse tankyrase1 are 98% identical overall, with most differences occurring in the N terminus, which is not implicated in the interaction with TRF1 or its PARP activity. We therefore used the available human tankyrase1 constructs for these tests because this approach allowed comparison of human and mouse TRF1 in the same experiment. In the far Western assay, mTRF1 behaved similarly to hTRF1ΔTank, forming a complex with TIN2 yet failing to interact with tankyrase1 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, mTRF1 did not bind tankyrase1 based on their lack of co-immunoprecipitation from transfected 293T cells (Fig. 2C). Additionally, GST-mTRF1 was not PARsylated by tankyrase1 in an in vitro PARP assay (Fig. 3). The reaction was validated by showing that hTRF1 and tankyrase1 were still modified in the presence of GST-mTRF1. This control was included to rule out that GST-mTRF1, the only protein prepared from bacteria, did not contain a fortuitous inhibitor of the PARP reaction. The effect of tankyrase1 on mTRF1 telomere localization was also examined. HeLa 1.2.11 cells infected with MYC-mTRF1 (Fig. 4C), NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 4D), and MEFs (Fig. 4E) were transfected with FN-tankyrase1, and the distribution of mTRF1 was assessed by immunofluorescence. As with hTRF1ΔTank, tankyrase1 failed to remove mTRF1 from telomeres. We also examined the effect of nuclear overexpression of tankyrase1 on the telomeric localization of other shelterin components, including mTIN2 (Fig. 4F), mRap1 (Fig. 4G), mPOT1a (Fig. 4H), and mPOT1b (Fig. 4E). For none of these shelterin proteins was tankyrase1 found to affect their localization. Collectively, the data suggest that tankyrase1 does not have the same role at mouse telomeres that is observed for human telomeres. This is not the first time a difference has been seen between human and mouse telomeres. The most striking recent divergence is the fact that rodent shelterin is comprised of two functionally distinct POT1 proteins, both of which are required to protect the telomere, whereas human shelterin only includes a single POT1 protein (27Hockemeyer D. Daniels J.P. Takai H. de Lange T. Cell. 2006; 126: 63-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the use of tankyrase1 as a shelterin accessory factor is another example of the rapid evolution of the telomere/telomerase system. Tankyrase1 presumably provides an additional level of control over telomere elongation by telomerase. Perhaps the tankyrase1 pathway allows the subset of telomerase positive human somatic cells to control the rate of telomere shortening. We thank Jeffrey Ye for guidance and advice, especially during the early stages of this project, Dirk Hockemeyer for the MYC-POT1a/b MEFs, and Kristina Hoke for helpful comments on this manuscript."

In contrast to the well established interactions that lead to substrate specificity for most enzymes, the molecular basis of promiscuity is not established. Specificity clearly is achieved in nature via optimally located hydrogen bonds, electrostatic bonds, and hydrophobic interactions. However, promiscuity now appears also to be a common trait among native and mutant enzymes, and promiscuous variants may be evolutionary intermediates that further mutate to expand the functional repertoire of the genome (3Taylor Ringia E.A.

It is widely assumed that functional promiscuity correlates with structural flexibility, which allows for recognition of diverse structures at minimal energetic cost (13Sethi D.K. Agarwal A.

However, a detailed understanding of the relationship between functional promiscuity, stability, and protein structural plasticity has not yet been achieved. Detoxification enzymes are among the most promiscuous enzymes known (19Ekroos M. Sjogren T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Speculatively, detoxification enzymes lie near the limits of substrate promiscuity attainable within the constraints of a defined protein fold. Among detoxification enzymes, the cytosolic glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) 2The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; HNE, 4-hydroxynonenal; HDE, 4-hydroxydecenal; MD, molecular dynamics; H/DX, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. are a structurally well defined canonical family that exhibit varying degrees of promiscuity and thus provide a model for the evolution of promiscuity or specificity (21Hayes J.D.

Methods Enzymol. 2005; 401: 9-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cytosolic human GSTs comprise several classes, designated as A, M, P, O, or T, distinguished by sequence and substrate selectivity. Each of these GSTs catalyzes the conjugation of the tripeptide GSH with electrophilic toxins. Elegant studies by others have considered substrate specificity among GSTs (23Dreij K. Sundberg K.

However, no explicit comparison of promiscuity and flexibility within the GST canonical fold has been described. The A-class GSTs play critical roles in detoxification of oxidative stress products. The A1-1 and A2-2 isoforms are highly substrate-promiscuous with catalytic activity toward many structurally unrelated toxins (23Dreij K. Sundberg K. Johansson A.S. Seidel E. Persson B. Mannervik B.

GSTA4-4 has much higher catalytic activity toward 4-hydroxynonenal and isoprostanes than GSTA1-1, but it has relatively low activity toward the “classic” GST substrate CDNB and other A1-1 substrates (23Dreij K.

GSTA1-1 and GSTA4-4 represent structural homologs with very different promiscuity profiles. These differences in substrate promiscuity have been largely attributed to differences in catalytic residues and local dynamics within the active site. Specifically, GSTA1-1 has highly disordered C-terminal residues (residues 212-222) that are crystallographically undefined in the apoenzyme (39Cameron A.D. Sinning I. L'Hermite G. Olin B. Board P.G. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These residues form a “loose” helix in the presence of GSH (40Zhan Y. Rule G.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7244-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) but not a GSH analog (41Adman E.T. Le Trong I. Stenkamp R.E. Nieslanik B.S. Dietze E.C. Tai G. Ibarra C. Atkins W.M. Proteins. 2001; 42: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Perhaps most interestingly, the C-terminal helix is highly ordered in the presence of GSH product conjugates, but the detailed location depends on the structure of the ligand (39Cameron A.D.

Sayed Y. Burke J. Dirr H.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15326-15332Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, GSTA4-4 has an analogous C-terminal helix that is well defined and located along one side of the narrow active site that readily accommodates lipid peroxidation products (24Bruns C.M. Hubatsch I. Ridderstrom M. Mannervik B. Tanner J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Moreover, the location of this helix is presumed to be insensitive to ligands. In short, known active site structural features contribute to the relative specificity of GSTA4-4 compared with GSTA1-1. An elegant redesign of A1-1 based on static crystal structures included replacement of 15 amino acids and resulted in a 20-fold increase in activity toward HNE (24Bruns C.M. Hubatsch I. Ridderstrom M. Mannervik B. Tanner J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 25Nilsson L.O. Gustaffson A. Mannervik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9408-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As part of our interest in understanding the molecular basis of the promiscuity, we have applied multiple experimental probes of flexibility and MD simulations to compare GSTA1-1 and A4-4. Here we report striking differences in the global solvent exchange properties of GSTA1-1 and A4-4, and differences in the apparent flexibility in the protein core and at residues far from the active site. We propose that global flexibility beyond the immediate binding environment of ligands facilitates functional promiscuity, as observed in detoxification enzymes. We also have redesigned the dynamics of these two isoforms by rationally altering their conformational dynamics with only two mutations in each. The dynamic-based redesign yields a more promiscuous GSTA4-4. Protein Expression, Mutagenesis, and Purification—The “swap” mutants were constructed using overlap extension PCR. For the GSTA1-1 V111F/R217Y mutant, the sequence of the primer containing the NdeI restriction site and the start codon was 5′-GAGGTCATATGGCAGAGAAGCCCAAGCTC-3′; for the V111F mutation, 5′-GATCCTCCTTCTGCCCTTCTGTCCACCTGAGG-3′ and its reverse complement; for the R217Y mutation and the SalI restriction site, 5′-GATGATGGGTCGACTTAAAACCTGAAAATCTTGTATGCTTCTTC-3′. For the GSTA4-4 F111V/Y217R mutant, the sequence of the primer containing the NdeI restriction site and the start codon was 5′-CATATGGCAGCAAGGCCCAAGCTCCACTATCCC-3′; for the F111V mutation, 5′-GGAACTGCTTATCATGCATCCTGTCTTAAAACCAGATGATCAG-3′ and its reverse complement; for the Y217R mutation and the SalI restriction site, 5′-GTCGACTTATGGCCTAAAGATGTTCCTGACGGTTCTCAC-3′. For the GSTA1-1 W21F/F222W mutant, the sequence of the primer containing the NdeI restriction site and the start codon was 5′-GAGGTCATATGGCAGAGAAGCCCAAGCTC-3′; for the W21F mutation, 5′-GGAGTCCACCCGGTTTCTCCTGGCTGCAGCTGG-3′ and its reverse complement; for the F222W mutation as well as the SalI restriction site, 5′-GATGATGGGTCGACTTACCACCTGAAAATCTT-3′. For each mutant, the PCR-amplified gene was digested with SalI and NdeI and subcloned into the vector pCWOri+. The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Wild type and mutants of GSTA1-1 and A4-4 were expressed in Escherichia coli using the BL21 strain, and all enzymes were purified via GSH-agarose and size exclusion chromatography as previously described (42Ibarra C. Nieslanik B.S. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10614-10624Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the following molar absorptivity coefficients at 280 nm for the folded protein: for A1-1 wild type, 4.27 × 104 ± 0.03 × 104 m-1 cm-1; for A1-1 V111F/R217Y, 3.65 × 104 ± 0.09 m-1 cm-1; for A4-4 F111V/Y217R, 3.26 × 104 ± 0.12 × 104 m-1 cm-1 for A1-1 W21F/F222W, 4.54 × 104 ± 0.10 × 104 m-1 cm-1. Urea Denaturation—The denaturation experiments were performed as described by others (49Wallace L.A. Dirr H.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16686-16694Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 50Wallace L.A. Sluis-Cremer N. Dirr H.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5320-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). GST A1-1 or A4-4 (final protein concentration of 2.3 μm) were unfolded in 0-8 m urea for 4 h at room temperature (25 °C) in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The fluorescence spectra were measured on an SLM-8100 fluorometer at 25 °C using excitation and emission path lengths of 10 and 2 mm, respectively. The band pass was 4 nm. Excitation was at 295 nm for Trp-21, and emission was monitored at 325 nm (native) and 355 nm (unfolded). The standard free energy difference between the native and denatured conformations was calculated by the equation, ΔGapp =-RTln(U/F), where U and F represent the concentrations of protein in the denatured and native state, respectively, at a particular urea concentration. The free energy of unfolding in the absence of urea, ΔGapp(H2O), was determined by fitting the data to a two-state unfolding model for each protein except the A4-4 F111V/Y217R mutant, which was fit to a three-state model. For dimeric proteins like GSTs, where ΔGapp(H2O) is concentration-dependent, m = (-RT ln[protein] + ΔGapp(H2O))/[urea]½, where the [urea]½ is the urea concentration at which the protein is half-denatured. The m value reflects the sensitivity of the transition region to denaturant concentration. Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange—Deuterium exchange experiments were performed on the free native enzymes, with well established experimental methods and data analysis (51Maier C.S. Deinzer M.L. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 402: 312-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 52Wales T.E. Engen J.R. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2006; 25: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 53Eyles S.J. Kaltashov I.A. Methods. 2004; 34: 88-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 54Busenlehner L.S. Armstrong R.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Time-dependant deuterium exchange was initiated by a 20-fold dilution of the enzyme with 10 mm Tris-DCl/D2O buffer (pD 7) at 5 °C. The protein/D2O solution was incubated at 5 °C for varying times (from 10 s to 40 m). At each time point, the exchange was quenched by mixing aliquots of the incubation mixture with an equal volume of ice-cold 50 mm potassium phosphate-sodium citrate buffer (pH 2.2) to drop the pH to 2.5. For the back-exchange control, the proteins were 20-fold diluted in 2 m d4-urea solution in D2O and incubated 8 h at 40 °C (50Wallace L.A. Sluis-Cremer N. Dirr H.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5320-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The quenched mixture was allowed to equilibrate on ice for 30 s, when 1 μl of ice-cold pepsin solution (3,660 units/mg solid, 24 mg/ml in H2O) was added to 20 μl of the protein solution. The digestion proceeded for 2 min on ice, and the resulting peptides were injected immediately into the high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system. The HPLC column and the entire injector assembly were packed in ice to minimize back-exchange during analysis. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—Electrospray mass spectra were recorded on a quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Instrument settings were as follows: electrospray voltage, 3.8 kV; extraction cone, 1 V; cone voltage, 65 V; source temperature, 100 °C. Data acquisition was carried out from 400 to 1700 m/z using a scan time of 2.4 s. Samples were injected on a perfusion chromatography column (0.5-mm inner diameter × 5 cm) packed in house with 30-μm POROS R2 particles (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). To minimize back-exchange, the deuterated pepsin-digested samples were eluted using isocratic chromatographic conditions, the mobile phase containing 20% solvent A (5% of acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol = 2:1, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and 80% solvent B (90% of acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol = 2:1 mixture, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 4 μl/min, with a total elution time of ∼5 min. Sequencing and assignment of the nondeuterated pepsin-digested samples were performed using the method described previously (55Mahajan S.S. Hou L. Doneanu C. Paranji R. Maeda D. Zebala J. Atkins W.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 8615-8625Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The deuterium incorporation was analyzed using HX-Express software (56Weis D.D. Wales T.E. Engen J.R. Hotchko M. Ten Eyck L.F. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 17: 1498-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and adjusted for back-exchange (57Zhang Z. Smith D.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 58Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Two data sets were averaged for each experiment. Kinetic Analysis of Exchange—Because two sequentially different proteins (53% sequence identity) were compared in our studies, the percentage exchange (Equation 1) was used instead of the absolute number of deuterons exchanged into each peptide. The exchange progress curve for each peptide was fitted to the sum of first-order rate terms (Equation 2) using OriginPro 7.0 (OriginLab) and by methods described by others to account for intrinsic exchange (57Zhang Z. Smith D.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). P=D/N&percnt;1 D=N(1−PiNΣi=1exp(−kit))2 D represents the absolute number of deuterons exchanged after adjustment of back-exchange. N is the total number of exchangeable amide hydrogens in the sequence. Pi is the percentage exchange at a given rate constant ki, during the time allowed for exchange t. For most of the peptides, the total exchangeable amide hydrogens can be divided into three groups, P1 (fast), P2 (intermediate), and P3 (slow), with the exchange rate constants k1 (>6 min-1), k2 (0.01-6 min-1), and k3 (<0.01 min-1), respectively. Those amides that exchange before the first 10 s time point (burst phase or fast exchange) could not be fitted and are reported as percentage of P1 only with an estimated k1 of >6 min-1. Data were also analyzed to account for possible sequence-dependent rates of exchange. Specifically, the intrinsic rates of exchange of the peptides in each protein were calculated by previously established methods (57Zhang Z. Smith D.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Measurement and Analysis—Fluorescence lifetime measurements were conducted using a Spex Fluorolog Tau3 frequency domain spectrofluorometer with a 450-watt xenon arc lamp (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ). For each experiment, 20-25 frequencies were chosen, ranging from 1 to 260 MHz. Ten replicate measurements were obtained at each frequency, with an integration time of 60 s for each measurement. The excitation monochromator was set at 295 nm, and the emission signals were collected through a Schott WG 305-nm high pass cut-off filter. The iris opening and slit widths were adjusted to maximize signal intensity while retaining appropriate modulation values. The lifetime reference standard was p-terphenyl dissolved in ethanol, with the concentration adjusted to achieve even signal strength between reference and sample. Data were collected with the protein concentration at 50 μm, and the S-hexyl-GSH final concentration was 2 mm. All samples were in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, except for samples with S-hexyl-GSH, where 1% ethanol was included. All experiments were performed at 12 °C. Decay data were fit using the Globals software package developed at the Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Fluorescence intensity (IF) can be described with the equation, IF(t)=nΣi=1fiτi−1e−t/τi3 where n is the total number of independent decay components in the system, and fi is the fraction of light contributing to the total fluorescence, which is proportional to the product of the fraction and its lifetime (τ). This can expressed as an integral in the limit when the number of components is large as follows, IF(t)= 0 ∫∞f(τ)τ−1e−t/τdτ The response of the system is given by Equation 5 when sinusoidally modulated light at an angular frequency ω is used for excitation, and F0 is the average fluorescence. F(t)=F0(1+msin(ωt−ϕ))5 The phase angle shift (φ) and modulation (m) are the observed quantities and can be related to the fluorescent system by Equations 6 and 7, ϕ=tan−1S(ω)/G(ω)6 m=(S2(ω)+S2(ω)jbc1/27 where S(ω) and G(ω) are the sine and cosine Fourier transforms of the fluorescence intensity. The functional models used for fitting can be described in terms of f(τ), such that a Gaussian distribution is defined in Equation 8, where C is the center of the distribution, W is the full width at half-height, and A is the amplitude, and the discreet component is contained in Equation 3. f(τ)=Ae(τ−μjbc2/2σ28 Catalytic Studies—Enzymatic activity assays with CDNB and HNE were performed using previously described methods (24Bruns C.M. Hubatsch I. Ridderstrom M. Mannervik B. Tanner J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 25Nilsson L.O. Gustaffson A. Mannervik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9408-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For the CDNB activity assay, product formation was monitored at 340 nm with 0-1.5 mm CDNB in 5% ethanol. For the HNE activity assay, substrate depletion was monitored at 224 nm in 1% ethanol. Due to low aqueous HNE solubility, high molar absorptivity, and the background reaction rate, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) was determined with replicates of <10 μm HNE rather than the full steady-state kinetic assay. All reactions were in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, were initiated with 1 mm GSH, and were monitored using an Agilent 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Kinetic constants were determined by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). For CDNB, the reaction velocities were determined by fitting to a straight line, and for HNE, velocities were determined by fitting to a one-phase exponential depletion curve. For CDNB, the curve of velocity versus substrate concentration was fit to the standard Michaelis-Menten equation.

The HIF-1α subunit is subjected to O2-dependent prolyl hydroxylation leading to ubiquitination by the von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL)-Elongin C ubiquitin-ligase complex and degradation by the 26 S proteasome. In this study, we demonstrate that spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) 2 plays an essential role in this process. SSAT2 binds to HIF-1α, VHL, and Elongin C and promotes ubiquitination of hydroxylated HIF-1α by stabilizing the interaction of VHL and Elongin C.

The activity of PHD2 is primarily responsible for the maintenance of low HIF-1α levels in oxygenated cells (33Berra E. Benizri E. Ginouves A. Volmat V. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4082-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Although PHD2 and HIF-1α bind to each other, efficient PHD2 activity is dependent on OS-9, a protein that binds to both PHD2 and HIF-1α, thereby insuring stable complex formation (34Baek J.H.

In addition to PHD inhibition, the stability of HIF-1α under hypoxic conditions is also dependent upon the binding of HSP90. 17-Allyl-17-aminomethylgeldanamycin, an anti-cancer agent that inhibits HSP90, induces ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α by an alternative pathway involving RACK1 (receptor for activated C kinase 1), which in parallel to VHL binds to both HIF-1α and Elongin C but unlike VHL does so by an O2-independent mechanism (35Liu Y.V. Baek J.H. Zhang H. Diez R. Cole R.N. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar).Finally, the ability of HIF-1α to interact with the co-activator proteins p300 and CBP is blocked by O2-dependent hydroxylation of Asn803 by factor inhibiting HIF-1 (36Lando D.

Factor inhibiting HIF-1 and OS-9 were identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for human proteins that interact with amino acid residues 576-826 of HIF-1α (34Baek J.H. Mahon P.C. Oh J. Kelly B.

Interaction of bait and prey proteins reconstitutes active GAL4, resulting in transcription of genes that mediate histidine auxotrophy (his+) and α-galactosidase activity. Purified his+/α-galactosidase+ colonies were grown in liquid medium lacking leucine to select for the presence of the prey vector and inoculated onto medium lacking leucine and supplemented with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide to cure clones of the bait vector and identify prey vectors encoding a protein capable of autonomous activation of the α-galactosidase reporter gene (i.e. false positives). Prey vector was isolated by the glass bead method (52Hoffman C.S. Winston F.

Cell lysates were applied to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were generated in reticulocyte lysates using the TnT T7 coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Ten μl of in vitro translated 35S-labeled protein was mixed with 4 μg of GST or GST-HIF-1α fusion protein (34Baek J.H. Mahon P.C. Oh J. Kelly B. Krishnamachary B. Pearson M. Chan D.A. Giaccia A.J.

After 30 min of mixing, the beads were washed with PBS-T. The proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography using Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad).Tissue Culture—Human 293 and 293T cells were cultured as described (53Semenza G.L.

The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. For hypoxic exposures, the cells were placed in a modulator incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg) that was flushed with 1% O2, 5%CO2, balance N2, sealed, and incubated at 37 °C.Construction of Expression Vectors—The open reading frame of SSAT2 was amplified from cDNA prepared from human umbilical vein endothelial cell mRNA using specific primers based on the nucleotide sequence of GenBank™ accession number NM_133491. The PCR product was inserted into pcDNA3.1(D)/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). For generation of SSAT2 deletion mutants, PCRs were performed using pcDNA3.1(D)/V5-His-SSAT2 as template and cloned into pcDNA3.1(D)/V5-His-TOPO vector. The coding sequences of SSAT2 were amplified with primers containing SmaI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites using pcDNA3.1(D)/V5-His-SSAT2 as template and ligated into SmaI- and XhoI-digested pGEX-5X-1 (GE Healthcare). The expression vectors for wild type and deletion mutants of HIF-1α were described previously (39Jiang B.H. Rue E. Wang G.L. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol.

Frydman, Stanford University) and ligated into HindIII- and XbaI-digested p3XFLAG-CMV-7 (Sigma).Transfection Assays—293 or 293T cells were seeded onto 48-well plates at 4 × 104 cells/well and transfected with plasmid DNAs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). After 24 h, the cells were exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 h. The cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were determined by multi-well luminescence reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). For p2.1 reporter assay, the cells were co-transfected with: 6 ng of control reporter pSV-Renilla; 56 ng of HIF-1 reporter p2.1 that contains a hypoxia response element from the human ENO1 gene upstream of SV40 promoter and firefly luciferase coding sequences; and expression vector encoding SSAT2, HIF-1α, FLAG-HIF-1α, or empty vector. Unless indicated otherwise, 80 ng of FLAG-HIF-1α, 400 ng of SSAT2, 1 ng of PHD2, or 1 ng of FLAG-HIF-1α (P402/564A) or (P402/564A/N803A) expression vector was used. In all transfections, the total amount of plasmid DNA was held constant by the addition of appropriate empty vector. For immunoblot assays, 293 cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/6-cm plate. The following day, the cells were co-transfected with expression vectors using FuGENE 6. After 24 h, the cells were exposed to 20% or 1% O2 with or without MG132 for 6 h and lysed in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), sodium orthovanadate, and sodium vanadate (Sigma).Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Assays—293 cells (3 × 106 cells/10-cm plate) were transfected with plasmid expression vectors using FuGENE 6 and exposed to 20% or 1% O2 with or without 10 μm MG132. The cells were lysed with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20. Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using control IgG (Oncogene), anti-FLAG (Sigma), or HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals) antibodies; anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science); or anti-V5-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) followed by immunoblot assay using antibody against HIF-1α (55Zhong H.

The SSAT2 shRNA insert consisted of the 19-nucleotide sequence tgtgatgccggaatatcgg, corresponding to nucleotides 284-302 of SSAT2 mRNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_133491), which was separated by a spacer (ttcaagaga) from the reverse complement of the same 19-nucleotide sequence. A scrambled negative control vector, constructed using a 19-nucleotide sequence (acgcatgcatgcttgcttt) with no significant similarity to any mammalian gene sequence, served as a control. Oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into BglII- and Hin-dIII-digested vector. 293 cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and lysed for RNA and protein isolation 24 h after transfection.Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Assays—Total RNA was extracted from cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNase. Five μg of total RNA were used for first-strand synthesis with iScript cDNA Synthesis system (Bio-Rad). cDNA was used for PCR analysis of SSAT2, HIF-1α, and VEGF mRNA and 18 S rRNA (primer sequences available upon request). PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose/ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis.Site-directed Mutagenesis—PCR-based mutagenesis was performed using pcDNA3.1(D)/V5-His-SSAT2 as template. The cycling parameters were 95 °C for 60 s, 58 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 6 min for 18 cycles using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Subsequently, plasmid DNA was digested with 10 units DpnI (Stratagene) for 1 h at 37 °C, before an a 10-μl aliquot was transformed into E. coli DH-5α cells. The mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing.Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as the means ± S.D. Differences between experiments were analyzed for statistical significance (p < 0.05) by analysis of variance or two-sample t test.RESULTSInteraction of SSAT2 with HIF-1α—The bait for two-hybrid screening was a fusion protein containing the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 fused to the basic helix-loop-helix and PER-ARNT-SIM homology domains of HIF-1α (Fig. 1A), which are required for dimerization and DNA binding of the HIF-1α:HIF-1β heterodimer (18Wang G.L.

From a screen of 1 × 106 yeast transformants, 23 prey fusion proteins, consisting of the GAL4 transactivation domain and amino acid sequences encoded by cDNAs prepared from human thymus mRNA, were identified that interacted with the bait fusion protein. The human sequence in one prey protein was that of full-length (170 amino acid residues) spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyl-transferase 2 (SSAT2; Unigene accession Hs.10846). SSAT2 is a protein that was identified based on 46% amino acid identity with SSAT1 (Unigene accession Hs.28491), which is a bona fide spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase (40Casero Jr., R.A. Celano P. Ervin S.J. Applegren N.B. Wiest L. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 810-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike SSAT1, SSAT2 does not function in polyamine catabolism, but instead acetylates thialysine (S-(2-aminoethyl)-l-cysteine), a naturally occurring modified amino acid (41Chen Y. Vujcic S. Liang P.

SSAT2 also bound to HIF-1α residues 81-200, spanning the PER-ARNT-SIM homology A subdomain (18Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interaction of V5 epitope-tagged SSAT2 and FLAG epitope-tagged HIF-1α was demonstrated in human 293 cells by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1D). V5-SSAT2 also interacted with endogenous HIF-1α that accumulated in response to hypoxia and/or treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 1E).Effect of SSAT2 on HIF-1α Expression—Compared with cells expressing FLAG-HIF-1α alone, HIF-1α protein levels were markedly reduced in cells in which V5-SSAT2 was co-expressed (Fig. 2A). The inhibitory effect of SSAT2 on HIF-1α expression was blocked by treatment with MG132 (Fig. 2B), indicating that SSAT2 induced the proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α. Overexpression of SSAT2 also inhibited transcription of a HIF-1-regulated reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Conversely, transfection of cells with an expression vector encoding both green fluorescent protein (Fig. 2D) and a shRNA that targeted SSAT2 mRNA for degradation (Fig. 2E) induced transcription of the HIF-1-dependent reporter gene in oxygenated cells (Fig. 2F). Thus, both gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies implicate SSAT2 as a negative regulator of HIF-1α protein levels under nonhypoxic conditions.FIGURE 2Effects of SSAT2 gain- or loss-of-function on HIF-1α protein levels and HIF-1 transcriptional activity. A, human 293 cells were transfected with expression vector encoding FLAG-HIF-1α, V5-SSAT2 or empty vector (EV). After 24 h, WCL were prepared and immunoblot assays were performed with antibodies against FLAG, V5, or β-actin using 80 μg of WCL directly. B, 293 cells were transfected with vector encoding FLAG-HIF-1α, V5-SSAT2, or EV and treated with 10 μm MG132 or vehicle for 6 h. Immunoblot assays were performed with anti-FLAG, anti-V5, or anti-β-actin antibodies. C, 293 cells were co-transfected with control reporter pSV-Renilla, HIF-1-dependent firefly luciferase reporter p2.1, and the indicated amount (in ng) of vector encoding V5-SSAT2, FLAG-HIF-1α, or EV for 24 h. The ratio of firefly:Renilla luciferase activity was determined. The results were normalized to those from cells transfected with EV (Luciferase Activity). The means and S.D. based on three independent transfections are shown. *, p < 0.05 for cells compared with cells transfected with HIF-1α + 0 ng SSAT2. D and E, cells were transfected with vector encoding GFP and SNC shRNA (2 μg) or SSAT2 shRNA (1 and 2 μg). D, after 37 h, transfected cells were analyzed by phase contrast microscopy to visualize cells and fluorescence microscopy to detect GFP expression. E, the transfected cells were exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 h. VEGF and SSAT2 mRNA and 18 S rRNA expression were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR. F, cells were co-transfected with pSV-Renilla, p2.1, and expression vector encoding both GFP and either SNC shRNA (2 μg) or SSAT2 shRNA (1 and 2 μg). After 37 h, luciferase activity was determined as described above. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SSAT2 overexpression also inhibited the induction of endogenous HIF-1α protein expression (Fig. 3A) and HIF-1-dependent gene transcription (Fig. 3B) under hypoxic conditions. Conversely, SSAT2 knockdown by shRNA increased HIF-1α protein expression (Fig. 3C) and HIF-1-dependent gene transcription (Fig. 3D) under hypoxic conditions. SSAT2 overexpression blocked the induction of endogenous VEGF mRNA expression in response to hypoxia (Fig. 3E, top panels). In contrast, neither hypoxia nor SSAT2 overexpression affected HIF-1α or β-actin mRNA levels (Fig. 3E, bottom panels). Taken together, these results indicate that SSAT2 reduces the levels of HIF-1α protein that are available to associate with HIF-1β to form the transcriptionally active heterodimer, thus reducing the expression of HIF-1-regulated genes such as VEGF.FIGURE 3Effect of SSAT2 on induction of HIF-1α in response to hypoxia. A, 293 cells were transfected with EV or plasmid encoding V5-SSAT2, and exposed to 20% or 1% O2 for 24 h. WCL were subjected to immunoblot assay using anti-HIF-1α, V5, or actin antibodies.

The precise function of KCNQ4 in the inner ear has not been established. However, recently we demonstrated that there is differential expression among four splice variants of KCNQ4 (KCNQ4_v1–v4) along the tonotopic axis of the cochlea. Alternative splicing specifies the outcome of functional channels by modifying the amino acid sequences within the C terminus at a site designated as the membrane proximal region. We show that variations within the C terminus of splice variants produce profound differences in the voltage-dependent phenotype and functional expression of the channel. KCNQ4_v4 lacks exons 9–11, resulting in deletion of 54 amino acid residues adjacent to the S6 domain compared with KCNQ4_v1. Consequently, the voltage-dependent activation of KCNQ4_v4 is shifted leftward by ∼20 mV, and the number of functional channels is increased severalfold compared with KCNQ4_v1. The properties of KCNQ4_v2 and KCNQ4_v3 fall between KCNQ4_v1 and KCNQ4_v4. Because of variations in the calmodulin binding domains of the splice variants, the channels are differentially modulated by calmodulin. Co-expression of these splice variants yielded current magnitudes suggesting that the channels are composed of heterotetramers. Indeed, a dominant negative mutant of KCNQ4_v1 cripples the currents of the entire KCNQ4 channel family. Furthermore, the dominant negative KCNQ4 mutant stifles the activity of KCNQ2–5, raising the possibility of a global disruption of KCNQ channel activity and the ensuing auditory phenotype.

KCNQ channels constitute delayed-rectifier K+ channels found in a wide range of excitable and non-excitable cells to control their membrane potentials and in so doing regulate Ca2+ influx. In the inner ear KCNQ channels are critical for auditory function, as mutations of KCNQ1 and KCNQ4 result in deafness and PHFHL, 4The abbreviations used are: PHFHL, progressive high frequency hearing loss; RT, reverse transcription; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; DN, dominant negative; CaM, calmodulin; CaMDN, dominant negative mutant of CaM; CaMBD, calmodulin binding domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT wild type; pF, picofarads; HC, hair cell. 4The abbreviations used are: PHFHL, progressive high frequency hearing loss; RT, reverse transcription; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; DN, dominant negative; CaM, calmodulin; CaMDN, dominant negative mutant of CaM; CaMBD, calmodulin binding domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT wild type; pF, picofarads; HC, hair cell. respectively (1Sanguinetti M.C.

Knipper M. Derst C. Fakler B. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2141-2149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Beisel K.W. Rocha-Sanchez S.M. Morris K.A. Nie L. Feng F. Kachar B. Yamoah E.N. Fritzsch B. J.

J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 653-660Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that there is differential expression among the four splice variants of KCNQ4 (KCNQ4_v1–4) along the tonotopic axis of the cochlea (8Beisel K.W. Rocha-Sanchez S.M. Morris K.A. Nie L. Feng F. Kachar B. Yamoah E.N. Fritzsch B. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9285-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The location-dependent variability in KCNQ4 expression suggests that KCNQ4 channels in the cochlear duct serve specialized physiological functions. A straightforward but accurate model of KCNQ and other K+ channel physiology in the inner ear maintains that the channels serve to regulate membrane potential to modulate the level of intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i), which serves as a ubiquitous second messenger. The KCNQ4 current, IK,n, moderates the resting membrane potential of inner hair cells and consequently controls the (Ca2+i) (4Oliver D. Knipper M. Derst C. Fakler B. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2141-2149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it would not be surprising to discover that KCNQ4 is under feedback modulation by the resultant Ca2+ fluxes that they ultimately regulate. CaM binds to the C termini of KCNQ channels, possibly as a constitutive auxiliary subunit, and mediates a Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the neuronal M-type K+ current that constitute KCNQ currents (11Wen H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7991-8001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yus-Najera E. Santana-Castro I. Villarroel A. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2003; 122: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Among the C termini of the splice isoforms of KCNQ4 in the cochlea are variations in the putative CaMBDs, raising the possibility that CaM modulation of the variants may be distinct (8Beisel K.W. Rocha-Sanchez S.M. Morris K.A. Nie L. Feng F. Kachar B. Yamoah E.N. Fritzsch B. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9285-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We are interested in the alternative splicing regions of the channel not only because they occur at the membrane proximal region of the C termini, which is essential for channel targeting to the plasma membrane (14Chung H.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8870-8875Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), but also because mutations in similar regions of other KCNQ channels (e.g. KCNQ2) have been linked to disease conditions such as benign familial neonatal convulsion and myokymia (15Biervert C.

Given their unique biochemical characteristics and differential expression, we predict that splice variants of KCNQ4 in the cochlea may confer diverse functional phenotypes. Here, we show that homomeric KCNQ4_v1–4 exhibit distinct voltage-dependent properties and membrane expression profiles. Meanwhile, the splice variants form heterotetramers with each other as well as with other KCNQ channels such that a DN mutant of one channel isoform cripples the entire series of KCNQ2–5 currents. Finally, consistent with variation in the CaMBDs, the channels are differentially modulated by CaM. The functional diversity and the differential tonotopic expression of the KCNQ4 splice variants may underlie the etiology of PHFHL associated with mutations of the channel. Molecular Cloning of Kcnq4 Channels—Kcnq4_v1 was amplified from a mouse cochlear total RNA using the Advantage-Taq cDNA and Advantage-GC polymerase mixes (BD Bioscience). Multiple primer sets were used to produce three overlapping fragments. The first fragment was obtained using primer pair 5′-agagagttggagtcggaagagc-3′ and 5′-tggagcaggcagtggtaagagc-3′, which contained the predicted transcription start site and the entire exon 1. An internal cDNA fragment was prepared using an upstream primer in exon1 (5′-agaactgggtctacaacgtgctgg-3′) and a downstream primer in the last exon (exon 14) (5′-gccagggagcgagttcaagtaag-3′). The 3′ fragment containing the polyadenylation signal was amplified using a 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends RT-PCR protocol (BD Biosciences) and an exon14 sense primer (5′-ctgggcactgtgcaagtgccgc-3′). Sequence appropriate clones were selected and cloned into HindIII and XbaI sites of a pCRII-TOPO vector. The resulting full-length mouse Kcnq4_v1 cDNA was sequence-verified to ensure fidelity of the sequence. Kcnq4_v4 was identified from the RIKEN inner ear subtracted cDNA library (clone F930013D18), but it lacked the very 5′ end of exon1 including the predicted ATG start site. A 5′ SacI/HindIII fragment from the Kcnq4_v1 was excised and inserted into Kcnq4_v4 to replace the truncated 5′ cDNA fragment. Constructs for Heterologous Expression in Chinese Hamster Ovarian (CHO) Cells—Both Kcnq4_v1 and Kcnq4_v4 channels were subcloned into a mammalian cell expression vector pEGFP-N3 (BD Biosciences, Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The Kcnq4_v1 clone was first digested with XbaI and blunted with T4 polymerase and then digested with HindIII. The DNA fragment containing full-length Kcnq4_v1 was cloned into a pEGFP-N3 vector digested with SmaI and HindIII. Similarly, the Kcnq4_v4 was digested with SfiI, blunt-ended, and then digested with SacI. The obtained full-length Kcnq4_v4 cDNA fragment was then ligated into SmalI/SacI of pEGFP-N3 vector. The construction of the Kcnq4_v2 and Kcnq4_v3 for the heterologous expression was generated by RT-PCR using the forward Kcnq4-fl-519 (5′-gattgtggtctttggcttggag-3′) and the reverse Kcnq4-fl-2166 (5′-ccagggagcgagttcaagtaag-3′) primer set with the total RNA obtained from CD1 mouse organ of Corti. The PCR products were subcloned into pCR-II TOPO; the BclI and BsmBI fragments of the cloned Kcnq4_v2 and Kcnq4_v3 were used to replace the BclI/BsmBI fragment of Kcnq4_v1 fragment of pEGFP-N3-Kcnq4_v1. The subsequent pEGFP-N3-Kcnq4_v2 and pEGFP-N3-Kcnq4_v3 clones were verified by sequence analyses. In all of these constructs enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) down-stream of MCS is not expressed since the full-length cDNAs of KCNQ4 variants were used. Plasmids (pJG60 and pGJ65) containing CaM and DN mutant of CaM (CaMDN) were obtained from Dr. Trisha Davis at University of Washington, Seattle. CaMDN has alanine substitutions of each of the four aspartates in the Ca2+ binding EF hands (D20A, D56A, D93A, D129A). The CaM and CaMDN coding regions were amplified by PCR using primers: CaM-up, cgtctcgagactgcgaccatggctgac; CaM-dw, ggctgcagtcacttagccgtcatcatttgc. The PCR products were then subcloned into the XhoI/PstI site of pIRES2-EGFP. The resulting constructs, pIRES2-EGFP-CaM and pIRES2-EGFP-CaMDN, were sequenced in both directions to confirm that the mutations had been maintained as intended and no new changes had been introduced by PCR. Tissue Culture and Transfection—CHO cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). CHO cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cell cultures were kept at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were trypsinized, plated at a concentration of 1.5 × 105 cells/ml in 2 ml of culture medium in 35-mm dishes, and transfected with 1 μg of total DNA per dish. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine following the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). The cells were rinsed in fresh culture medium and incubated for 24 h before patch clamp recordings. Transfected cells were identified for recording by visualization of the EGFP co-transfection (BD Bioscience, Clontech). Immunocytochemical Analysis of KCNQ4 Channel Expression—CHO cells were co-transfected with pEGFP-N3-KCNQ4_v1 or pEGFP-N3-KCNQ4_v4 and pEGFP-F (BD Bioscience, Clontech) in which the EGFP is fused with a farneslyation signal from c-HA-Ras so that the EGFP became plasma membrane-bound and could serve as a plasma membrane marker. After 24 h in the culture media, the cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After fixation, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The fixative was washed with PBS, and the cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal donkey serum for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with primary antibody (rabbit anti-KCNQ4 antibody, 1:800) in PBS with 5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight. The cells were washed 3 times in PBS and then incubated with donkey anti-rabbit-cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA 1:800) in PBS for 1.5 h. The cells were incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min followed by 3 washes in PBS. Finally the cells were mounted onto slides in anti-fade medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss, LSM510 spectral confocal imaging system coupled to an inverted microscope. Electrophysiology—Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed from single cells at room temperature (20–22 °C) using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc. Union City, CA). Fire-polished electrodes (3–5 megaohms) were pulled from borosilicate glass. The electrodes contained 140 mm KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 4 mm K2ATP 4, pH 7.2, with KOH. The external bathing solution was constantly perfused (∼2–3 ml/min) and contained 145 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 d-glucose, pH 7.40, with NaOH. Outward KCNQ4 current traces were generated with depolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of –70 mV and stepped to varying positive potentials (ΔV = 10 mV). Currents were measured with capacitance compensation and series resistance compensation (>90%) and filtered at 2 kHz using an 8-pole Bessel filter and sampled at 5 kHz. Whole cell K+ current amplitude at varying test potentials was measured at the peak and steady-state levels using a peak and steady-state detection routine; the current was divided by the cell capacitance (pF) to generate the current density-voltage relationship. Nonstationary fluctuation analysis was used to estimate the number (N) of functional channels in the membrane. For a homogeneous population of channels gating independently, the mean macroscopic current (I) is defined as follows: I = Nipo. The macroscopic variance (σ2) is defined as σ2 = Ni2po(1 – po), where i is the single-channel current amplitude, and po represents the open probability of the channel (18Begenisich T. Stevens C.F. Biophys. J. 1975; 15: 843-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Ehrenstein G. Lecar H. Nossal R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1970; 55: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Variance was calculated by subtracting pairs of sequential current records to obtain the difference current. The variance was then averaged over all the records collected (20Tsien R.W. Bean B.P. Hess P. Lansman J.B. Nilius B. Nowycky M.C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1986; 18: 691-710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Provided that I and σ2 are determined for a range of open probabilities, I and N can be estimated by a plot of variance versus mean current fit by the following parabolic function: σ2 = iI – I2/N (21Sigworth F.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1980; 307: 97-129Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Analyses of data were performed using custom-made software and Microcal Origin (Northampton, MA) programs. Pooled data are presented as the means ± S.D. Multiple comparisons versus control (KCNQ4_v1) data were performed using Kruskal-Wallis one way analysis of variance (Dunn’s method). Unless indicated otherwise, reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Previously, the KCNQ4 channel had been cloned from the human brain and identified in the inner ear (2Kubisch C. Schroeder B.C.

Using RT-PCR strategies, we have recently identified and cloned four Kcnq4 splice variants (v) directly from the mouse cochlea (8Beisel K.W. Rocha-Sanchez S.M. Morris K.A. Nie L. Feng F. Kachar B. Yamoah E.N. Fritzsch B. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9285-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis has revealed that these splice variants were derived from the different utilization of exons 9, 10, and 11 of Kcnq4 gene (Fig. 1A). Whereas KCNQ4_v1, v2, and v3 include exon 10, exon 11, and exon 9, respectively, KCNQ4_v4 excludes the three exons (Fig. 1, A and B). Analysis of the amino acid sequences of different KCNQ4 channels revealed that these splice variants are identical except for the C termini (Fig. 1, C and D).

In Fig. 2 we illustrate the phenotypic features of KCNQ4_v1 expressed in CHO cells. The current rectifies outwardly, showing stunted growth at hyperpolarized step potentials in contrast to depolarized step potentials from a holding potential of –70 mV (Fig. 2A). The activation voltage of the expressed KCNQ4_v1 was ∼–50 mV as shown in the current density-voltage (I-V) relation in Fig. 2B. From tail current traces, the reversal potential (Erev) of the current was estimated (Fig. 2C) and used to calculate the conductance of the channel at a given step potential. Consistent with a K+-selective channel, the Erev was –85 ± 3 mV (n = 9) compared with the expected Erev of –89 mV. The voltage-dependent activation of whole-cell current was fit with a Boltzmann function, and a half-activation, V1/2, of –0.2 ± 3.2 mV and a slope factor, k, of 15.2 ± 1.8 mV (n = 18) were determined for the KCNQ4_v1 channels. To confirm that the current was indeed derived from KCNQ4 channels, we determined the sensitivity of the current to linopirdine and bepridil, which are known blockers of KCNQ4 currents (24Lerche C. Scherer C.R. Seebohm G. Derst C. Wei A.D. Busch A.E. Steinmeyer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22395-22400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The current was blocked by both drugs. Shown in Fig. 2E is the time course of blockade by these drugs. The dose-response curve revealed a linopirdine concentration of ∼11 μm for half-inhibition of the current (Fig. 2F). To determine the functional significance of C-terminal alterations in KCNQ4_v1–4 variants, CHO cells were transfected with the individual splice variants under similar conditions. Transfection of the four splice variants led to the expression of well resolved K+ currents carried by recombinant KCNQ4 channels. After a 24-h transfection of equal amounts of cDNA (1 μg) for KCNQ4_v1–4, there were striking differences in the relative magnitudes of the whole-cell K+ current that ensued from each of the splice variants (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B compares the I-V relation of the four splice variants, showing significant differences between KCNQ4_v1 and KCNQ4_v2–4 currents. The mean current densities (I (pA/pF)) at 60-mV step potential were 9.9 ± 2.9, 25.3 ± 2.6, 31.8 ± 2.1, and 111.4 ± 9.4 for KCNQ4_v1–4 (n = 18; p < 0.05), respectively. The voltage-dependent activation curves were also dissimilar between the four splice variants (Fig. 3C). The largest effect was ∼20-mV negative voltage shift in the V1/2 of the steady-state activation curve for KCNQ4_v4 compared with the V1/2 of KCNQ4_v1. Descriptive statistics of the V1/2 (mV) of splice variants were –0.2 ± 4.1, –17.1 ± 4.4, –18.6 ± 3.6, and –21.5 ± 1.0 for KCNQ4_v1–4 (n = 14; p < 0.05), respectively. To estimate the number of functional channels expressed in CHO cells, we employed nonstationary fluctuation analysis of whole-cell KCNQ4 currents using tail currents elicited at –100 mV. Fig. 4 plots variance as a function of mean current for KCNQ4_v1 and KCNQ4_v4. The peak of the parabolic fit yields the number of functional channels (N), which is significantly higher for KCNQ4_v4 than KCNQ4_v1 (KCNQ4_v1 n = 780 ± 142, KCNQ4_v4 n = 3004 ± 719; n = 5; p < 0.01). Moreover, estimates from the unitary current amplitude (i) from the nonstationary fluctuation analysis suggest that the single channel currents may also differ between the two isoforms (KCNQ4_v1 i = 0.6 ± 0.3 pA; KCNQ4_v4 i = 1.4 ± 0.4 pA; n = 5; p < 0.05). Lack of the 54 amino acids at the C terminus of the KCNQ4_v4 rendered the channel more accessible to functional membrane expression. We illustrate in Fig. 5 that membrane expression of KCNQ4_v4 is relatively more robust than that of KCNQ4_v1.FIGURE 4Nonstationary fluctuation analysis of KCNQ4_v1 and KCNQ4_v4 channel currents. The mean tail currents were at –100 mV versus the variance were plotted for KCNQ4_v1 (A) and KCNQ4_v4 (B). Data from 75+ consecutive tail current traces were collected at 7-s intervals. The lines represent best fits to the parabolic function σ2 = iI – (I2/N), where σ2, i, I, and N represent variance, single-channel current amplitude, macroscopic current, and the total number of channels, respectively. The number of functional channels (N) estimated for the example shown is indicated. The mean data for N from 5 cells were 780 ± 142 and 3004 ± 719; n = 5; p < 0.01). Our analyses of i suggest that the unitary events may also change. The mean data for i were 0.6 ± 0.3 and 1.4 ± 0.4; n = 5; p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Surface expression of KCNQ4 channels. KCNQ4_ v1 and KCNQ4_v4 were co-expressed with a plasmid pEGFP-F, which encodes a plasma membrane marker (a farnesylated enhanced green fluorescent protein, green) in CHO cells. The expression of KCNQ4_v1 shows the scattered pattern (A–D, red), whereas that of KCNQ4_v4 is more intensive and even (F–I, red). The nuclei of the cells were visualized by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue). The fluorescent intensity of KCNQ4 channels (red) and the membrane marker (green) were plotted against the distance from the beginning of the arrow shown in D and I; the overlap between red and green fluorescent signals illustrates the surface expression of KCNQ4 channels (E and J). The scale bar is 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We sought to delineate the role of heteromultimeric interactions in the current magnitude and voltage-dependent properties of the KCNQ4 channels. Transfection of CHO cells with a combination of KCNQ4 splice variants produced current magnitudes and voltage dependences that were consistent with the formation of heteromeric channels. For example, the magnitude of the resulting current was not always in accord with independent addition of the homomeric current amplitude, and the voltage-dependent activation of the current could not be predicted by simple addition of two independent channel currents (Fig. 6). Several ion channel mutations have been identified that are capable of disabling channel activities in a DN manner when normal and defective subunits co-assemble to form multimeric complexes. If indeed the KCNQ4 channels form heteromultimers, then a DN mutant of one variant should cripple the functional channels. A 853G → T mutation that produces a missense mutation of Gly285 → Ser (G285S) in the pore region (GYG) of KCNQ4_v1 has been identified, and the mutation G285S suppresses channel activity by ∼90% in vivo (2Kubisch C.

The same mutation was introduced into KCNQ4_v1 and KCNQ4_v4 by site-directed mutagenesis technique. Fig. 7 shows that co-expression of the mutant channels KCNQ4_v1DN and KCNQ4_v4DN with the wild-type (WT) channels suppressed the corresponding WT current magnitude (Fig. 7, A and D). In addition, co-expression of the mutant channels disabled the activity of KCNQ4_v2 and v3 as well (Fig. 7, B and C). The functional implications for the impairment of other subtypes of KCNQ channels by KCNQ4DN were broadened by co-expressing the mutant channels with KCNQ1–3 and KCNQ5. Co-expression of KCNQ4_v1 and KCNQ2–5 yielded current amplitudes which suggested that the channels may form heteromultimers (Fig. 8). Co-expression of the mutant channel had no effect on the functional expression of KCNQ1 (Fig. 9D). Moreover, the mutant channel suppressed the activity of KCNQ2–3 and KCNQ5 (Figs. 8 and 9, A–C and E) but produced no change in the permeation and gating properties of the WT currents. These findings dovetail well with reports which demonstrate that KCNQ1 does not co-assemble with other subtyp"

Although certain cellular proteins are known to either stimulate or inhibit its activity, little is known about post-translational modifications of this enzyme and their possible regulatory functions. In this study, we have identified isoforms 1 and 2 of hGK as novel substrates for the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme system of the rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Both isoforms were polyubiquitinated on at least two lysine residues, and mutation analysis indicated that multiple lysine residues functioned as redundant acceptor sites. Deletion of its C-terminal α-helix, as part of a ubiquitin-interacting motif, affected the polyubiquitination at one of the sites and resulted in a completely inactive enzyme. Evidence is presented that poly/multiubiquitination of hGK in vitro serves as a signal for proteasomal degradation of the newly synthesized protein. Moreover, the recombinant hGK was found to interact with and to be allosterically activated up to ∼1.4-fold by purified free pentaubiquitin chains at ∼100 nm (with an apparent EC50 of 93 nm), and possibly also by unidentified polyubiquitinated proteins assigned to their equilibrium binding to the ubiquitin-interacting motif site. The affinity of pentaubiquitin binding to hGK is regulated by the ligand (d-glucose)-dependent conformational state of the site. Both ubiquitination of hGK and its activation by polyubiquitin chains potentially represent physiological regulatory mechanisms for glucokinase-dependent insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells.

(ATP:d-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.2) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of glycolytic flux in hepatocytes and pancreatic β-cells at physiological millimolar concentrations of glucose (Glc). This 50-kDa size monomeric hexokinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of d-glucose to form glucose 6-phosphate with MgATP2- as the phosphoryl donor and is characterized by a low affinity for Glc ([S]0.5 ∼ 8.0 mm), a positive kinetic cooperativity of Glc binding (nH ∼ 1.7), and no feedback inhibition by its product. Besides its expression in hepatocytes (isoforms 2 and 3) as a cytoplasmic and nuclear enzyme, where its translocation and activity is regulated by the glucokinase regulatory protein and the metabolic state of the cell (1de la Iglesia N.

In pancreatic β-cells GK has been found to be partitioned between the cytoplasm and the insulin secretory granules as a peripheral membrane protein (2Toyoda Y. Yoshie S. Shironoguchi H. Miwa I.

In pancreatic β-cells, GK acts as the glucose sensor (5Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Am. J.

Little is known about covalent post-translational modifications of GK and their possible regulatory functions, and the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in its degradation/turnover are also poorly understood. In this study, we have identified isoforms 1 and 2 of hGK as novel substrates for the ubiquitin (Ub)-conjugating enzyme system of the rabbit reticulocyte lysate.

Plasmid Constructs, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Forms of hGK—Plasmid constructs, protein expression, and purification are described in supplemental methods. In Vitro Expression of hGK—hGK in the pcDNA3.1+ or pcDNA3.1/HisC vector was expressed in a coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (TnT® T7 Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System; Promega) in the presence of [35S]Met. The reaction contained in a final volume of 50 μl: 1 μl of [35S]Met (10 μCi), 2 μg of plasmid DNA, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μm Ub (in addition to the endogenous content of Ub) and 40 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate.

One- and Two-dimensional Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—hGK and its Ub conjugates generated in the in vitro assays were precipitated with precooled acetone (sample/acetone 1:4, by volume at -20 °C for 1-2 h prior to centrifugation at 14 000 rpm, 30 min). Samples prepared for one-dimensional electrophoresis containing [35S]Met-labeled hGK were dissolved in SDS sample buffer and denatured for 15 min at 56 °C before SDS-PAGE (10% gel). The 14C-methylated protein standard contained myosin (220 kDa), phosphorylase-b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (46 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), and lysozyme (14.3 kDa). Samples prepared for two-dimensional electrophoresis were dissolved in a sample buffer containing 8 m urea, 2% (w/v) Chaps, 1% (v/v) IPG ampholyte solution (pH 3-10 NL), and 50 mm dithiothreitol. The first dimension was performed at 200 v for 20 min, 450 v for 20 min, 750 v for 20 min, and 2000 v for 1.10 h. The second dimension was run in a gradient of 4-12% (w/v) precast acrylamide gel (1.0 mm). The gel was subjected to immunoblot analysis with a GK-specific Ab. Gels were analyzed on a Fuji bas-2500 and band intensities calculated by Image Gauge v4.0 (Fujifilm). Immunoblot Analysis—High molecular mass forms of unlabeled recombinant hGK proteins (isoforms 1 and 2) generated in the in vitro ubiquitination assay were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and immunoblotted by standard procedures. The primary Ab (anti-GK) and the secondary Ab (peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG) were diluted 1:2000. Ub-conjugated proteins were detected with an anti-Ub primary Ab that recognizes both unconjugated and conjugated mono- and polyubiquitin and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as the secondary Ab, both diluted 1:1500. The ladder of reference proteins was MagicMark™ XP Western Protein Standard (Invitrogen) with nine recombinant proteins, range 20-220 kDa. The enhanced chemiluminescence detection method was employed to develop the immunoblots.

Assay of hGK Activity—In the standard assay the catalytic activity of purified recombinant hGK was measured in a reaction volume of 1 ml containing: 25 mm sodium Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm ATP, 1 mm NAD+, 0.35 units of glucose-6-phosphatase, 0.5 μg of recombinant hGK, and 50 mm d-glucose. The time course of the NADH formation was followed at 340 nm in a thermostated cuvette (37 °C) of the Hewlett Packard photodiode array spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453), and the activity was calculated from the linear slope. Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence—Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was performed on a PerkinElmer LS-50B instrument at 25 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, and a protein concentration of 0.03 mg/ml.

Equilibrium Binding of Polyubiquitin Chains to hGK and hGKΔC24—The chromatographic holdup assay was performed essentially as described by Charbonnier et al. (16Charbonnier S. Zanier K. Masson M. Trave G. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 50: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For details, see supplemental methods. Structural Analysis—An analysis of the three-dimensional structure of hGK revealed the sequence EEGSGRGAALVSAVA at positions 442-456 at the C-terminal α-helix (Fig. 1A). This sequence is homologous to the core ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) sequence eeeXϕXXAXXXSXXe, where e is a negatively charged residue, ϕ is most often the hydrophobic residues Leu, Ile, or Ala, and X is any amino acid (17Miller S.L.

Interestingly, the helix length, and thus the conformation of this site, changes upon binding of Glc and an allosteric activator (Fig. 1B), and its orientation relative to the specifically interacting helix 6 (residues 204-217) changes as well (Fig. 1C). 3The helix nomenclature. In this study we used the MolMovDB (available at molmovdb.mbb.yale.edu/molmovdb/) to demonstrate the regions of variable secondary structure in the two determined crystal structures of hGK (20Kamata K.

Structure. 2004; 12: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). 17 helices were identified in the ligand-free super-open structure (PDB code 1v4t) versus 19 helices in the Glc and allosteric activator-bound closed structure (PDB code 1v4s); H17 (residues 448-459) → H19 (residues 444-459) in the closed conformation (see molmovdb.mbb.yale.edu/cgi-bin/morph.cgi?ID=496337-23316). In general, UIM sites promote ubiquitination as well as binding of polyubiquitin chains (17Miller S.L. Malotky E. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33528-33537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18Flick K. Raasi S. Zhang H. Yen J.L. Kaiser P. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2006; 8: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and both possibilities were addressed in the present study. In Vitro Synthesis and Posttranslational Ubiquitination of hGK—As seen from Fig. 2, lane 1, [35S]methionine (Met)-labeled His6-hGK synthesized in the coupled in vitro transcription-translation system of the RRL is a substrate for the Ub-conjugating enzyme system of the lysate. Several high molecular mass bands were observed in addition to the full-length His6-hGK (56 kDa). Some minor low molecular mass bands were regularly observed, presumably representing incomplete chains (19Jungbauer L.M. Bakke C.K. Cavagnero S. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1121-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) because their presence was not affected by protease or proteasome inhibitors. An identical electrophoretic pattern was observed with a construct of WT-hGK (Fig. 2, lane 2), but of slightly lower molecular mass. The apparent molecular masses of the individual radioactive bands were 56, 67.5, 74, and 79 kDa for His6-hGK and 53, 64.5, 71, and 76 kDa for WT-hGK, respectively, and the high molecular mass bands amounted to ∼17% of the total. The [35S]Met-labeled His6-hGK was purified by affinity binding to and gradient elution from Ni2+-chelated magnetic beads. The 56-kDa His6-hGK was preferentially eluted at 1 m imidazole (Fig. 2, lane 3). Using the purified His6-hGK as the substrate in the in vitro RRL system the level of Ub conjugates was found to increase in proportion to the concentration of the RRL lysate used in the incubation (supplemental Fig. S1A, lanes 1-6, and S1B). To further characterize the Ub conjugates of hGK, purified recombinant hGK (isoforms 1 and 2) was used as substrate for the Ub-conjugating enzyme system of the RRL. When analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis in a high-resolution polyacrylamide gradient gel, immunodetection with anti-GK revealed that the high molecular mass forms were positioned in a diagonal pattern at a progressively higher pI than the unmodified hGK, as expected for a polyubiquitinated protein (Fig. 3, A and B). Immunodetection with anti-ubiquitin Ab revealed a similar pattern (Fig. 3A, inset). The conjugates in these experiments represented ∼50% of the total immunoreactive protein in the gels for both isoforms. Interestingly, the molecular mass position of hGK·Ub1 and hGK·Ub2 revealed a double spot. The respective spots demonstrated the same pI but different mobilities as SDS denatured proteins, presumably due to different conformations, thus indicating two putative ubiquitin acceptor sites in hGK. To possibly identify the target residue(s) for ubiquitination, the 22 lysine residues common to the isoforms were individually mutated to arginine (Arg) (supplemental Table S1) and the mutant forms were expressed in vitro as His6-tagged and [35S]Met-labeled proteins in the RRL system. For all mutant forms, identical electrophoretic patterns of Ub conjugates were observed, as shown for WT-hGK in Fig. 2. The lysine residues are distributed rather uniformly along the protein, with some residues closely spaced in the linear sequence of flexible loop structures or closely spaced in the three-dimensional structure (20Kamata K. Mitsuya M. Nishimura T. Eiki J. Nagata Y. Structure. 2004; 12: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Hence, multiple lysine residues of hGK presumably function as redundant acceptor sites. When the hGKΔC24-truncated form, devoid of the putative UIM site (Fig. 1), was expressed in the RRL system the double bands observed for His6-hGK·Ub1 and His6-hGK·Ub2 of the WT-hGK were replaced by single bands (Fig. 4, A and B). This finding indicates that the ubiquitination of one of the target sites is coupled to the UIM site. Interestingly, the C-terminal-truncated form revealed a total loss of catalytic activity (data not shown). Proteasomal Degradation of Newly Synthesized and Ubiquitinated hGK—Proteasome-dependent degradation of hGK was studied co-translationally by expressing [35S]Met-labeled His6-hGK for only 30 min in the standard RRL system. Then its stability was followed in a proteasome- and ATP-enriched RRL system, in the absence and presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. As seen from Fig. 5, the total intensity of the hGK signal (radioactivity), including His6-hGK and its ubiquitinated forms, increased ∼1.8-fold (n = 5 and p = 0.008) in the presence of MG-132. Thus, inhibition of the proteasomal activity resulted in a stabilization of the newly synthesized enzyme. The degree of inhibition observed may to some extent have been affected by the relatively high concentration of nonspecific Ub conjugates in the RRL representing competitive substrates in terms of proteasomal degradation (21Eytan E. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Equilibrium Binding of Polyubiquitin Chains and Catalytic Activation of WT-hGK—To further characterize the C-terminal UIM site (Fig. 1), we studied the equilibrium binding of polyubiquitin chains (mainly Ub5-Lys-48 linked) to GST-WT-hGK or GST-hGKΔC24 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B using a chromatographic holdup assay. The amount of bound and free analyte was measured by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4C), which revealed that polyubiquitin chains bind to GST-WT-hGK in the absence of Glc (Fig. 4D, columns 1 and 2), but not to GST-hGKΔC24 lacking the UIM site (Fig. 4D, columns 3 and 4). Moreover, in the presence of 50 mm Glc, the binding of the analyte to GST-WT-hGK was markedly reduced (columns 5 and 6) as expected from the lower accessibility of the key interacting residues of the UIM site in the ligand-bound conformation of WT-hGK (Fig. 1D). As seen from Fig. 6A and 6B, column 2, free polyubiquitin chains also stimulated the catalytic activity of recombinant hGK in a concentration-dependent manner and in the low nanomolar concentration range. An ∼1.4-fold stimulation (n = 4) was observed at 97 nm Ub5-Lys-48, and the [S]0.5 value for Glc was slightly reduced, i.e. from 8.62 ± 0.22 to 8.18 ± 0.27 mm (data not shown). A similar small reduction was observed in the Kd value for the equilibrium binding of Glc at 25 °C, i.e. from 4.8 ± 0.06 to 4.3 ± 0.15 mm, as determined by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (data not shown). It is also seen that monoubiquitin was much less efficient in stimulating the activity. In addition, it is seen from Fig. 6B that the reticulocyte lysate, containing a plethora of Ub conjugates (22Davydov I.V. Kenten J.H. Safiran Y.J. Nelson S. Swenerton R. Oberoi P. Biebuyck H.A. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 415-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and free polyubiquitin chains (supplemental Fig. S2A), has a similar (∼1.4-fold) stimulatory effect. In pancreatic β-cells the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been found to have a regulatory role in the Glc-stimulated insulin release (15Lopez-Avalos M.D. Duvivier-Kali V.F. Xu G. Bonner-Weir S. Sharma A. Weir G.C. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1223-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), Glc-stimulated (pro)insulin synthesis (13Kitiphongspattana K. Mathews C.E. Leiter E.H. Gaskins H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15727-15734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and in the biogenesis and surface expression of the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels (12Yan F.F. Lin C.W. Cartier E.A. Shyng S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289 (-C1359): C1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) as well as in maintaining a normal function of the voltage-dependent calcium channel (14Kawaguchi M. Minami K. Nagashima K. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13015-13020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that hGK of the pancreatic β-cell (isoform 1) and the hepatocytes (isoform 2) are posttranslationally modified by multiple moieties of Ub. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig. 3, A and B) demonstrate the formation of hGK·Ub1-3 on at least two putative target lysine residues where the double spot of SDS-denatured hGK·Ub1 and hGK·Ub2 in the second dimension represent two ubiquitinated species with presumably different conformations having the same pI. A similar heterogeneity (double bands) has been reported for in vitro ubiquitinated luciferase (23Murata S. Minami M. Minami Y. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) as well as for Lys-48-Ub2 and Lys-48-Ub3 synthesized in vitro (24Pickart C.M. Raasi S. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, on site-directed mutagenesis, in which 22 of the lysine residues in hGK were individually mutated to Arg and expressed in vitro, no specific acceptor site could be identified. Multiple lysine residues in hGK, therefore, seem to function as redundant acceptor sites as previously exemplified by cyclin B (25King R.W. Glotzer M. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1343-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and cyclin A (26Fung T.K. Yam C.H. Poon R.Y. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1411-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the mutant forms tested were catalytically active with a specific activity in the range of 65-99% of WT-hGK (data not shown). Deletion of the 24 C-terminal amino acids, with the UIM site, resulted in polyubiquitination at an apparently single site (Fig. 4A), indicating that the ubiquitination of one site is promoted by the UIM site as previously shown for UIM-containing proteins (27Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitination often serves as a signal for targeting cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins to the proteasome for subsequent degradation (reviewed in Ref. 11Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3318) Google Scholar). We found that the 30-min in vitro translated [35S]Met-labeled His6-hGK and its ubiquitinated forms were unstable in a proteasome- and ATP-enriched reticulocyte lysate degradation assay that was sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Fig. 5). It has recently been proposed (28Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) that the key targeting step for proteasome-mediated degradation is the conjugation of multiple short ubiquitin chains, independent of linkage type. This finding may explain the proteasomal degradation of newly synthesized hGK in our cell-free system, suggesting that its degradation may function as a regulatory mechanism in the homeostatic control of the cellular GK protein expression as demonstrated for several long-lived proteins (29Schubert U. Anton L.C. Gibbs J. Norbury C.C. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar).

The participation of DNA ligase I in these transactions is directed by physical and functional interactions with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a DNA sliding clamp, and, replication factor C (RFC), the clamp loader. Here we show that DNA ligase I also interacts with the hRad17 subunit of the hRad17-RFC cell cycle checkpoint clamp loader, and with each of the subunits of its DNA sliding clamp, the heterotrimeric hRad9-hRad1-hHus1 complex. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of RFC, hRad17-RFC stimulates joining by DNA ligase I. Similar results were obtained with the homologous Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins indicating that the interaction between the replicative DNA ligase and checkpoint clamp is conserved in eukaryotes. Notably, we show that hRad17 preferentially interacts with and specifically stimulates dephosphorylated DNA ligase I. Moreover, there is an increased association between DNA ligase I and hRad17 in S phase following DNA damage and replication blockage that occurs concomitantly with DNA damage-induced dephosphorylation of chromatin-associated DNA ligase I. Thus, our results suggest that the in vivo interaction between DNA ligase I and the checkpoint clamp loader is regulated by post-translational modification of DNA ligase I.

DNA ligases, which join breaks in the phosphodiester backbone of duplex DNA, are required for DNA replication, DNA repair, and genetic recombination (1Tomkinson A.E. Vijayakumar S. Pascal J.M. Ellenberger T. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the human genome, there are three genes that encode DNA ligases, LIG1, LIG3, and LIG4 (1Tomkinson A.E. Vijayakumar S. Pascal J.M. Ellenberger T. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 687-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To date, a single human individual with inherited mutations in the LIG1 gene has been identified (2Barnes D.E. Tomkinson A.E. Lehmann A.R. Webster A.D. Lindahl T. Cell. 1992; 69: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This individual exhibited retarded growth and development, and immunodeficiency (3Webster A.D. Barnes D.E. Arlett C.F. Lehmann A.R. Lindahl T. Lancet. 1992; 339: 1508-1509Abstract PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, there was a marked defect in Okazaki fragment joining and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents, in particular the DNA alkylating agent, methyl methanesulfate (4Henderson L.M.

More recently, the mutation in the human LIG1 gene responsible for the cellular phenotype has been reiterated in the mouse (8Harrison C. Ketchen A.M. Redhead N.J. O'Sullivan M.J. Melton D.W. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4065-4074PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, this mouse model of DNA ligase I deficiency exhibits genomic instability and an increased frequency of cancer. Genetic, biochemical, and cell biology studies have together provided compelling evidence that human DNA ligase I is a key participant in DNA replication and DNA repair (2Barnes D.E. Tomkinson A.E.

An interaction between DNA ligase I and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) 4The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PIP box, PCNA binding motif; RFC, replication factor C; DBD, DNA binding domain; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; yRFC, yeast replication factor C; IP, immunoprecipitation; h, human. is required for the targeting of DNA ligase I to DNA replication foci and also for the efficient joining of Okazaki fragments and completion of long patch base excision repair (11Levin D.S.

Villa A. Biamonti G. Tomkinson A.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3786-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In these DNA transactions, the homotrimeric PCNA ring acts as a DNA sliding clamp that interacts with and coordinates the sequential action of DNA processing enzymes, ending with ligation by DNA ligase I (14Warbrick E. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 15Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 16Garg P. Burgers P.M. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The PCNA ring is loaded onto DNA by replication factor C (RFC), a heteropentameric complex that can also unload PCNA (17Cai J. Uhlmann F. Gibbs E. Flores-Rozas H. Lee C.G. Phillips B. Finkelstein J. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12896-12901Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). RFC interacts with and inhibits DNA ligase I (19Levin D.S. Vijayakumar S. Liu X. Bermudez V.P. Hurwitz J. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55196-55201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) but this inhibition is alleviated by PCNA in a reaction that is dependent upon the physical interaction between PCNA and DNA ligase I (19Levin D.S.

Recently, we have shown that the physical interactions and functional interplay also occur among the homologous proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (20Vijayakumar S. Chapados B.R. Schmidt K.H. Kolodner R.D. Tainer J.A. Tomkinson A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 1624-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that RFC plays a critical role in the ligation step that joins adjacent Okazaki fragments and completes long patch base excision repair. PCNA and RFC are the prototypic members of an emerging family of DNA sliding clamps and clamp loaders that are involved in cell cycle checkpoints, sister chromatid cohesion, and genome stability in addition to DNA replication (21Majka J. Burgers P.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 227-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In the cell cycle checkpoint response activated by either replication blockage or DNA damage, the DNA sliding clamp is a heterotrimer composed of hRad9, hRad1, and hHus1 proteins (21Majka J. Burgers P.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 227-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The hRad9-hRad1-hHus1 clamp is loaded onto DNA by the heteropentameric hRad17-RFC clamp loader (22Bermudez V.P. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Cesare A.J. Maniwa Y. Griffith J.D. Hurwitz J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 23Ellison V. Stillman B. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E33Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Both the checkpoint and replicative clamp loader complexes contain the same four small RFC subunits, p36, p37, p38, and p40, but are distinguished by their large subunits, hRad17 and RFCp140, respectively (21Majka J. Burgers P.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 227-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Following replication block, hRad17-RFC interacts with RPA-coated single strand regions and loads the hRad9-hRad1-hHus1 clamp onto the DNA (24Zou L. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13827-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 25Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In the case of DNA damage, the checkpoint clamp complex is recruited to DNA lesions to activate the DNA damage checkpoint. Recent studies in S. cerevisiae indicate that the checkpoint clamp directly activates the checkpoint kinase Mec1, the ortholog of human Atr (26Majka J. Niedziela-Majka A. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, there is emerging evidence that Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 may also be recruited to the site of a DNA lesion by interactions with the DNA damage recognition proteins for base excision (27Chang D.Y. Lu A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 408-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28Shi G. Chang D.Y. Cheng C.C. Guan X. Venclovas C. Lu A.L. Biochem.

Wang W. Keng P.C. Bambara R.A. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Whereas DNA ligase I interacts with both PCNA and hRad9-hRad1-hHus1, there appear to be clear differences in the mechanism and functional consequences of these interactions. In this study, we have confirmed that DNA ligase I interacts with and is stimulated by hRad9-hRad1-hHus1. More importantly, we have identified a novel physical and functional interaction between DNA ligase I and hRad17-RFC that also occurs between the homologous S. cerevisiae proteins, Cdc9 and Rad24-RFC. Unlike the replicative clamp loader, which inhibits DNA joining (19Levin D.S. Vijayakumar S. Liu X. Bermudez V.P. Hurwitz J. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the physical and functional interaction between DNA ligase I and hRad17-RFC is modulated by post-translational modification of DNA ligase I.

To prepare beads for pull-down assays, GST and GST fusion proteins (5 μg of each) were incubated with a 20-μl slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A for 1 h at 4 °C with constant agitation. After washing with buffer A, the beads were resuspended in 250 μl of buffer A containing purified full-length DNA ligase I or various truncated derivatives.

DNA Joining Reaction with Biotin-labeled Linear Substrate—A5′-biotinylated 90-mer oligonucleotide was annealed with two complementary 15-mers, one of which was 5′-end labeled with 150 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), to generate a partial duplex of 30 bp containing a single ligatable nick in the middle flanked by single-stranded regions of 30 nucleotides (19Levin D.S.

Streptavidin-agarose beads (10 μl; Pierce) were incubated with 1 pmol of the biotinylated linear DNA substrate in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. After washing three times in ligation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 100 μm ATP, and 100 mm NaCl), the beads were incubated with 1 pmol of E. coli single-stranded binding protein/pmol of DNA in the same buffer for 15 min at room temperature. This substrate was then incubated with 50, 150, and 500 fmol of hRad17-RFC and hRad9-hRad1-hHus1 both individually and together at 30 °C for 2 min. DNA ligase I (50 fmol) was added, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The beads were then spun down, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of stop mixture (50% glycerol, 1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.05% bromphenol blue). Similar reactions were carried out with yeast Rad24-RFC, yRFC, and Cdc9 DNA ligase. After heating at 100 °C for 3 min to denature DNA, a 2.5-μl aliquot was mixed with 2.5 μl of denaturing PAGE dye (80% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol, and 0.05% xylene cyanol) and then separated by electrophoresis through a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried, exposed to a Storage Phosphor screen and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Treatment of HeLa Cells and 46BR.1G1 Cells—To synchronize HeLa cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, an asynchronous population was incubated with 500 μm mimosine for 24 h (43Ferrari G. Rossi R. Arosio D. Vindigni A. Biamonti G. Montecucco A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37761-37767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HeLa cells and derivatives of 46BR.1G1, one of which stably expresses FLAG-tagged wild type DNA ligase I (12Levin D.S. McKenna A.E. Motycka T.A. Matsumoto Y. Tomkinson A.E. Curr.

Biamonti G. Montecucco A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37761-37767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An asynchronous population was incubated with 2 mm thymidine for 18 h and then released for 8 h. After incubation with 2 mm thymidine for another 18 h, the cells were released for 4 h. Cell cycle distributions were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis in the Flow Cytometry Core of the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center. To induce replication blockage, HeLa cells that had been synchronized in S phase were incubated for 1 h with medium containing 10 mm hydroxyurea. Where indicated, cell populations were irradiated with 12 gray of ionizing radiation using a γ-ray irradiator (Mark I, model 68A, JL Shepherd and Associates). Subcellular Fractionation—Chromatin fractionation was performed as described previously (44Post S.M. Tomkinson A.E. Lee E.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5568-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal numbers of synchronized or treated cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation in buffer C (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitors mixtures I and II (Sigma) for 5 min. After centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 4 min, the supernatant/cytoplasmic fraction (Cyto) was removed. The pellet containing nuclei was washed in buffer C and then lysed in buffer D (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as above). Soluble nuclear proteins (Nuc Sol) were separated from the chromatin fraction (Chr) by centrifugation at 1,700 × g for 4 min. The chromatin-enriched pellet was washed in buffer D, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and then sonicated three times for 15 s. Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells and 46BR.1G1 cells (107) were lysed in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml ethidium bromide, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate). Approximately 3.5 mg of the clarified extract was used for each immunoprecipitation. Extracts were precleared by incubation for 1 h at 4°C with 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose and Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with IP buffer, prior to the addition of antibodies against DNA ligase I and hRad17. After incubation at 4 °C overnight, 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose and Protein G-Sepharose beads were added, and the incubation continued for 1 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with IP buffer lacking ethidium bromide, and then resuspended in SDS sample buffer. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence and Microscopy—HeLa cells were cultured on cover glasses, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 before immunostaining with antibodies as recommended by the antibody manufacturer (Abcam). Images were captured using a Nikon E400 fluorescence microscope. Physical Interactions between DNA Ligase I and Both the hRad17-RFC Clamp Loader and hRad9-hRad1-hHus1 DNA Sliding Clamp—Previously we fractionated a HeLa nuclear extract by DNA ligase I affinity chromatography to provide initial evidence for the association of DNA ligase I with the replicative DNA sliding clamp PCNA and its cognate loader RFC (11Levin D.S.

Using the same strategy, we observed the specific retention of the hRad17 subunit of the hRad17-RFC cell cycle checkpoint clamp loader complex and the hRad9 subunit of the cell cycle checkpoint DNA sliding clamp, hRad9-hRad1-hHus1 (Fig. 1A). We estimate that at least 50% of the loaded hRad17 and hRad9 was retained by the DNA ligase I affinity beads and eluted in the 150 and 300 mm NaCl eluates. Moreover, these proteins co-eluted with RFCp140, the unique large subunit of RFC (Fig. 1A). To demonstrate that DNA ligase I interacts directly with the hRad17-RFC and hRad9-hRad1-hHus1 complexes, we performed pull-down assays with DNA ligase I beads and recombinant hRad17-RFC and hRad9-hRad1-hHus1 complexes purified from insect cells (39Lindsey-Boltz L.A.

https://openalex.org/W1997349764,"A 6-alkylidiene penam sulfone, SA-1-204, is an efficient inhibitor of both SHV-1 and OXA-1 beta-lactamases with K(I) = 42 +/- 4 nm and 1.0 +/- 0.1 microm, respectively. To gain insight into the reaction chemistry of SA-1-204, the reactions between this inhibitor and SHV-1 and OXA-1 were studied by Raman spectroscopy in single crystals and in solution. Raman signatures characteristic of the unreacted beta-lactam ring show that in both phases the inhibitor binds as a noncovalent Michaelis-like complex. This complex is present as the major population for periods of up to an hour. On longer time scales, the Raman data show that beta-lactam ring opening eventually leads to a complex mixture of reaction products. However, the data clearly demonstrate that the key species for inhibition on the time scale of bacterial half-lives is the noncovalent complex preceding acylation."
https://openalex.org/W2077788492,"We have investigated the mechanism responsible for half-of-the-sites activity in the dimeric cytochrome bc1 complex from Paracoccus denitrificans by characterizing the kinetics of inhibitor binding to the ubiquinol oxidation site at center P. Both myxothiazol and stigmatellin induced a 2–3 nm shift of the visible absorbance spectrum of the bL heme. The shift generated by myxothiazol was symmetric, with monophasic kinetics that indicate equal binding of this inhibitor to both center P sites. In contrast, stigmatellin generated an asymmetric shift in the bL spectrum, with biphasic kinetics in which each phase contributed approximately half of the total magnitude of the spectral change. The faster binding phase corresponded to a more symmetrical shift of the bL spectrum relative to the slower binding phase, indicating that approximately half of the center P sites bound stigmatellin more slowly and in a different position relative to the bL heme, generating a different effect on its electronic environment. Significantly, the slow stigmatellin binding phase was lost as the inhibitor concentration was increased. This implies that a conformational change is transmitted from one center P site in the dimer to the other upon stigmatellin binding to one monomer, rendering the second site less accessible to the inhibitor. Because the position that stigmatellin occupies at center P is considered to be analogous to that of the quinol substrate at the moment of electron transfer, these results indicate that the productive enzyme-substrate configuration is prevented from occurring in both monomers simultaneously.

The intertwined arrangement of the two Rieske proteins, which shuttle electrons from QH2 oxidation at center P to cytochrome c1 in each monomer, prevents the dissociation of the dimer without the complete loss of function. Therefore, the conserved dimeric structure seems to have been selected very early in evolution to allow electron transfer in two tightly associated monomeric units. In previous studies using the yeast bc1 complex, we have provided evidence that only one center P site oxidizes QH2 at a time (6Covian R. Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15040-15049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and that electrons equilibrate rapidly between cytochrome b subunits via the bL hemes (7Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22732-22740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), highlighting the functional relevance of the dimeric structure. More recently, we have found that the two Q reduction (center N) sites in the dimer exhibit different kinetic properties with respect to each other when both Rieske proteins are located close to center P (8Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30925-30932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results imply conformational communication between center P and center N, as well as between center N sites. We have proposed that all these features of the dimer allow electrons from center P to be more easily recycled back to Q at center N, thereby preventing electrons from accumulating in cytochrome b, which could potentially cause electron leakage to oxygen (7Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22732-22740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol.

An important prediction of an alternating half-of-the-sites activity model for the dimeric bc1 complex is that each center P site should be able to sense and respond to the conformation and occupancy state of the other. In this work, we have taken advantage of the strong spectral shift induced by the tight binding of the center P inhibitors myxothiazol and stigmatellin to the P. denitrificans cytochrome bc1 complex to reveal conformational communication between center P sites. Our results support a mechanism in which induction of the catalytically competent conformation at one center P upon ligand binding transmits a conformational change to the other monomer, preventing QH2 oxidation by the second center P site.

Membranes were solubilized with dodecylmaltoside (1.2 g/g of protein) and diluted to a salt concentration of 350 mm NaCl with 50 mm MES/NaOH (pH 6.0), 0.02% (w/v) dodecylmaltoside before anion exchange chromatography. A salt gradient between 350 and 600 mm NaCl in the above detergent buffer was applied. The bc1 enzyme eluted around 450 mm NaCl, and pooled fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Centricon, exclusion limit 100 kDa), applied to a gel-filtration column (Superose 6 prep grade), equilibrated with the same buffer as mentioned above, and concentrated again to a final bc1 enzyme concentration of ∼0.1–0.3 mm. The complex was identified and checked for its quality by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, redox spectra, and activity measurement, giving the same results as published earlier (13Schroöter T. Hatzfeld O.M. Gemeinhardt S. Korn M. Friedrich T. Ludwig B. Link T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Extinction coefficients used for quantification of the purified complex were 23.2 mm–1 cm–1 for cytochrome c1 at 553–539 nm based on the pyridine hemochrome spectrum (16Anderka O. Structural and Functional Studies on the Cytochrome bc1 Complex from Parococcus denitrificans. 2005; (, Ph.D. thesis, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitaöt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany)Google Scholar), and 25.6 mm–1 cm–1 at 561-578 nm for cytochrome b as reported for other organisms (17Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Use of these extinction coefficients yielded a b:c1 hemes ratio of 2.0. Pre-steady State Reduction of bc1 Complex or Exogenous Cytochrome c—Pre-steady state reduction of cytochrome c1, cytochrome b, and exogenous horse heart cytochrome c was followed at room temperature by stopped-flow rapid scanning spectroscopy using the OLIS rapid scanning monochromator as described before (6Covian R. Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15040-15049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For these experiments, we used a bc1 complex with a Y159F mutation in the Rieske protein, which has a ∼44 mV lower Em value for the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster than in the wild-type enzyme (13Schroöter T. Hatzfeld O.M. Gemeinhardt S. Korn M. Friedrich T. Ludwig B. Link T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), favoring electron distribution into cytochrome c1. Reactions were started by rapid mixing of 2.2 μm enzyme with or without 15 μm horse heart cytochrome c in assay buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2 mm sodium azide, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.05% dodecylmaltoside against an equal volume of the same buffer containing 24 μm DBH2. In some experiments, 2.5 μm antimycin was added to the enzyme mixture 2 min before rapid mixing. For each experiment, 12–15 datasets were averaged after subtracting the oxidized spectrum. The time course of absorbance change at the appropriate wavelengths was extracted using software from OLIS and exported to the Origin 5.0 program (OriginLab Corp.). The contribution of cytochrome b to c1 absorbance was calculated and corrected for as previously described (6Covian R. Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15040-15049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Absorbance changes as a function of time were fitted to monophasic or biphasic exponential functions in Origin. When present, cytochrome c reduction was quantified using an extinction coefficient of 21.5 mm–1 cm–1 (19Margoliash E. Walasek O.F. Method Enzymol. 1967; 10: 339-348Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Kinetic Modeling—Cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c reduction were fitted or simulated using the Dynafit program (Biokin Ltd.), which allows the comparison of time-dependent data to different reaction mechanisms described as a series of kinetic steps (20Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). The script files describing the mechanisms are provided as supplemental material and are similar to those we have reported for the yeast bc1 complex (6Covian R. Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15040-15049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), with variations accounting for the particular Em values of the P. denitrificans enzyme. Individual rate constants were fixed to non-rate-limiting values, and only the substrate binding rate constant was allowed to vary during fitting. The forward rate of DBH2 oxidation was fixed to 48 s–1, the turnover rate of the Y159F enzyme under steady-state conditions. The Em values at pH 7.5 of each redox group were used to set the ratios of forward and reverse rates at each electron transfer step. For DBH2, a value of 60.5 mV was assumed considering a ΔEm of 59 mV/pH unit from Em7 = 90 mV. The Y159F mutant Rieske protein was assumed to have a Em of 221 mV based on a ΔEm of –44 mV with respect to the 265-mV value reported for the wild type (13Schroöter T. Hatzfeld O.M. Gemeinhardt S. Korn M. Friedrich T. Ludwig B. Link T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21Meinhardt S.W. Yang X. Trumpower B.L. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8702-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lowest in the range of Em values reported for the P. denitrificans cytochrome c1 (22Ritter M. Anderka O. Ludwig B. Maöntele W. Hellwig P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12391-12399Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was used (268 mV). Em values for heme bH and bL were assumed to be +58 and –92 mV, respectively (22Ritter M. Anderka O. Ludwig B. Maöntele W. Hellwig P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12391-12399Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Using the Nernst equation, the ΔEm of 79 mV between DBH2 and the average Em for the Rieske protein and the bH heme (139.5 mV) was used to set a forward/reverse rate ratio of 4.7 for the first turnover at center P. For the second turnover, an average Em of 64.5 mV for the Rieske protein and the bL heme was used to set a rates ratio of 1.08. Electron transfer from the Rieske protein to cytochrome c1 was assumed to be favored by a factor of 2.33 over the reverse process based on a ΔEm of 47 mV. For modeling of exogenous cytochrome c reduction, electron transfer from c1 was assumed to occur with Keq = 1. The anti-mycin-insensitive reduction of cytochrome c mediated by superoxide formation was expressed as a single step in which oxygen binding to the QH2-occupied center P resulted in superoxide formation and Rieske protein reduction with a rate that was adjusted during the fitting. Superoxide was then assumed to reduce cytochrome c directly with a bimolecular rate of 1.1 × 106 m–1 s–1 (23Butler J. Jayson G.G. Swallow A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 408: 215-222Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Kinetics of Inhibitor Binding to the bc1 Complex—Purified bc1 complex from wild-type P. denitrificans was diluted to 4 μm in the same buffer used for pre-steady state experiments, reduced with dithionite, and mixed rapidly against an equal volume containing the indicated concentration of myxothiazol or stigmatellin. The fully reduced spectrum before mixing was stored as a baseline and subtracted from all subsequent scans, 10–12 datasets were averaged, and the time course of absorbance change at selected wavelengths was exported to the Origin program. The differences in absorbance between the peak, trough, and isosbestic point of the spectral shifts induced by inhibitor binding were plotted and fitted to monophasic or biphasic exponential functions. Half-of-the-sites Reactivity at Center P in the Presence of Antimycin—The pre-steady state reduction of the P. denitrificans bc1 complex containing the Rieske protein with the Y159F mutation is shown in Fig. 1. Both cytochrome c1 subunits in the dimer underwent almost complete reduction in the uninhibited condition, but only half were reduced in the presence of anti-mycin (Fig. 1A). Because the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster in this mutant has an Em that is 44 mV lower than that of the c1 heme (13Schroöter T. Hatzfeld O.M. Gemeinhardt S. Korn M. Friedrich T. Ludwig B. Link T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a 70% reduction of cytochrome c1 should have occurred after the first turnover at center P, assuming all monomers were active. Moreover, with the assumption that each monomer functions independently, the kinetic modeling showed that a partial second turnover should be expected even if the bH heme in each monomer is inaccessible as electron acceptor due to antimycin inhibition of bH heme reoxidation, yielding a final extent of c1 reduction of 90% (dotted line, Fig. 1A). In contrast, if only one center P per dimer was assumed to be active and electron crossover between monomers occurs, the resulting predicted curve (solid line) corresponded closely with the experimentally observed cytochrome c1 reduction of ∼45%. Cytochrome b reduction kinetics in the presence of antimycin (Fig. 1B) also agreed with the interpretation that only one center P was active. Kinetic modeling showed that both bH hemes in the dimer plus a fraction of the bL hemes should have undergone reduction if DBH2 oxidation had occurred at center P in both monomers (dotted line). Assuming only one monomer was active resulted in a much better fit to the observed extent of reduction (solid curve). This model assumed that the electron from a second turnover at the only active center P in the dimer could reach the bH heme in the inactive monomer, resulting in ∼80% reduction of both bH hemes. Pre-steady state reduction kinetics in the presence of exogenously added cytochrome c and antimycin are shown in Fig. 2. Within 1 s, ∼2 cytochrome c molecules (Fig. 2A) and 2 bH hemes (Fig. 2B) per dimer underwent reduction in a fast phase. This was followed by a slower phase during which several equivalents of cytochrome c were reduced with only a part of the bL hemes being reduced at the same time. This slower reduction of cytochrome c without a corresponding transfer of electrons to cytochrome b was evidently due to the leakage of one of the electrons derived from DBH2 oxidation at center P to oxygen to form superoxide, which can itself reduce cytochrome c (24Sun J. Trumpower B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 25Muller F.L. Roberts A.G. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6493-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We confirmed that superoxide formation was involved in this slow cytochrome c reduction by performing the assay in the presence of manganese-superoxide dismutase, which resulted in the expected 40–50% inhibition in the rate of the second phase of cytochrome c reduction (results not shown). The first fast phase of simultaneous c and bH reduction was used to determine how many center P sites were active per dimer. Kinetic modeling showed that the reduction of almost 4 cytochrome c equivalents per dimer should have occurred in the fast phase (which corresponds to the bifurcated DBH2 oxidation) if all center P sites had been active (dotted curves in Fig. 2A), corresponding to two turnovers per monomer. This expectation comes from the equilibrium constants for the first and second turnovers at each active center P in the antimycin-inhibited enzyme, which were set to 4.7 and 1.08, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental material). Given that both DBH2 and cytochrome c were present in super-stoichiometric concentrations with respect to the enzyme, almost two full turnovers per active center P are thermodynamically possible. Therefore, a good fit of the experimental data was obtained only if one center P site per dimer was considered to be active (solid curves), corresponding to the reduction of 2 cytochrome c equivalents per dimer during the fast kinetic phase. Heme bL Spectral Shifts Induced by Binding of Center P Inhibitors—The fully reduced P. denitrificans bc1 complex exhibits a shoulder at 566 nm, which corresponds to the absorbance maximum of the bL heme (1Yang X.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12282-12289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, when this reduced spectrum is taken as a baseline and myxothiazol or stigmatellin are added to the P. denitrificans enzyme, the maximal absorbance of the bL heme shifts 2 or 3 nm, respectively, to a lower wavelength. As can be seen in Fig. 3A, the peak generated by myxothiazol at 563 nm was mirrored by a trough of equivalent amplitude at 569 nm. The symmetry of this spectral shift implies that the shape of the bL absorbance spectrum was not altered, suggesting a homogeneous binding of myxothiazol to all center P sites. This inhibitor binds to a sub-domain within center P that is located proximal to the bL heme and does not establish any interactions with the Rieske protein (4Zhang Z.L. Huang L.S. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Another inhibitor that binds to the same pocket is methoxyacrylate stilbene (26Esser L. Quinn B. Li Y.F. Zhang M. Elberry M. Yu L. Yu C.A. Xia D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 281-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This inhibitor also generated a symmetrical shift, with a peak equal in magnitude to the trough, in the spectrum of the bL heme (result not shown), although the peak was shifted to a longer wave-length (568 nm) instead of to a shorter one (563 nm), as was the case with myxothiazol. As shown in Fig. 3B, binding of stigmatellin changed not only the wavelength of maximal bL heme absorbance, but also the shape of the resulting difference spectrum. This was evidenced as a trough at 569 nm that was ∼3-fold larger in amplitude than the peak at 562 nm, due to a pronounced narrowing of the bL spectrum at higher wave-lengths (565–569 nm). This result indicates either heterogeneous binding of stigmatellin to a fraction of center P sites, or alternatively, a decrease in the extinction coefficient of the bL heme along with a spectral shift upon homogeneous binding of the inhibitor. Stigmatellin binds to a center P sub-domain different than the one to which myxothiazol binds, being at a greater distance from the bL heme and establishing a hydrogen bond with a histidine residue that is coordinated to the FeS cluster of the Rieske protein (4Zhang Z.L. Huang L.S. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). UHDBT is another inhibitor that binds to the same pocket as stigmatellin, although more weakly (11Von Jagow G. Link T.A. Method Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 26Esser L. Quinn B. Li Y.F. Zhang M. Elberry M. Yu L. Yu C.A. Xia D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 281-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). UHDBT also generated an asymmetrical blue shift in the absorbance spectrum of the bL heme, although its magnitude was only ∼25% of that induced by stigmatellin (not shown). Binding Kinetics of Myxothiazol to Center P—The symmetrical blue shift of bL absorbance generated by myxothiazol was followed as a function of time to determine the binding rate of this inhibitor to center P, as shown in Fig. 4. Myxothiazol bound in a single kinetic phase at all concentrations tested, resulting in a linear relation between binding rate and inhibitor concentration (Fig. 4B). The slope of this plot corresponds to the value of the second order rate constant for myxothiazol binding (8.4 × 104 m–1 s–1). The value of the intercept with the y-axis gives an estimate of the dissociation rate constant and, as expected for a tightly bound inhibitor, was very close to zero (0.04 s–1). This result indicates that myxothiazol binds with the same kinetics to both center P sites in the bc1 complex dimer. The addition of one equivalent of antimycin per bc1 monomer before rapid mixing with myxothiazol gave the same kinetic results for myxothiazol binding, although the amplitude of the blue shift was decreased by 50% (data not shown). This indicates that the rate of myxothiazol binding and its symmetry were not affected by the presence of the center N inhibitor, although the position of myxothiazol relative to the bL heme appeared to be slightly altered, based on the change in amplitude of the spectral shift. Essentially the same results were obtained when myxothiazol binding was determined in the Y159F mutant enzyme used for the pre-steady reduction assays shown in Figs. 1 and 2 (not shown). Binding Kinetics of Stigmatellin to Center P—As shown in Fig. 5A, the asymmetrical shift in the spectrum of the bL heme upon binding of 15 μm stigmatellin occurred in two phases, each comprising approximately half of the difference between peak and trough. There was a ∼3-fold difference in the rate of each kinetic component. Poor fitting was obtained if only one kinetic component was assumed, as evidenced in a residual plot by the deviation of the fitted curve with respect to the experimental data points (Fig. 5A, inset). This biphasic binding pattern was not caused by a change in free inhibitor concentration as the binding occurred, because myxothiazol at the same ratio of inhibitor to enzyme (7.5:1) gave strictly monophasic kinetics (see Fig. 4A). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 5B, each kinetic phase contributed differently to the peak and trough of the spectral blue shift. Thus, when the absorbance at a wavelength where inhibitor binding had no effect on the spectrum (540 nm) was subtracted from the absorbance change at the wavelength of the peak (562 nm), it became evident that the fast kinetic phase was responsible for over two-thirds of the absorbance increase. In contrast, the slow phase accounted for most of the decrease in absorbance at the spectral trough (569 nm). This indicates that (a) stigmatellin binding induces a different effect upon bL heme absorbance at approximately half of the center P sites, and (b) the asymmetric spectral shift observed after equilibration with the inhibitor (see Fig. 3B) cannot be attributed to a homogeneous binding of stigmatellin to all center P sites resulting in a simultaneous decrease in the extinction coefficient along with a spectral shift of all bL hemes. Similar results were obtained when both center N sites were occupied by antimycin, or with the Y159F enzyme (not shown). The asymmetric binding of stigmatellin was evidenced more clearly by deconvoluting the spectral shift induced by each kinetic phase, as shown in Fig. 6. This was accomplished by averaging the spectra collected within the first 100 ms after mixing with stigmatellin, because during this time range the second phase of binding did not contribute significantly to the overall spectral shift. The absorbance of this averaged spectrum, which comprises only the shift induced by the fast binding event, was multiplied by a factor in order to yield an absorbance equivalent to that of 47% of the total spectral shift, as calculated from the fitting in Fig. 5A. The resulting spectrum, shown in Fig. 6A, was then subtracted from the final spectrum collected at 4 s, when stigmatellin binding was completed. This difference spectrum, shown in Fig. 6B, represents the spectral shift induced only by the slow stigmatellin binding phase. As can be seen from these spectra, the initial binding of stigmatellin to one half of the center P sites produced an almost symmetrical blue shift, indicating that the shape and amplitude of the heme spectrum were preserved. In contrast, the remaining half of the absorbance change was observed as a strongly asymmetrical shift composed mainly of a sharp decrease in absorbance centered at 569 nm. Again, this result is consistent with the assumption that stigmatellin binds differently to each of the two center P sites in the dimeric bc1 complex but not with the alternative explanation that the spectral asymmetry is the product of a slow decreased extinction coe"

Second, incubation of cells with phenanthroline diminished the proportion of degraded high pI CD3ɛ isoforms, but also the ability of the cells to deliver early TCR activation signals. Third, cells expressing mutant CD3ɛ chains lacking N-terminal acid residues showed facilitated recognition by antibody YCD3-1 and enhanced TCR-mediated activation.

Finally, it has been shown that covalently linked ζ chain homodimers are needed for efficient transport of complete TCR-CD3 complexes from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface (reviewed in Ref. 2Alarcón B. Gil D. Delgado P. Schamel W.W.A. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 191: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and data from in vitro assembly of TCR-CD3 chains suggest the association of one ζ dimer per complex (3Call M. Pyrdol J.

From these data, it follows that the minimal TCR-CD3 complex unit contains eight polypeptides (αβ·ɛδ·ɛγ·ζ2). The data summarized above have been generated using many different cells and cell lines in diverse experimental approaches, and it would be reasonable to conclude that the TCR-CD3 complex is a constant structure, the components of which (beyond those differences arising from V region variability) are equal in all T cells. However, the existing data also indicate that there are profound quantitative and qualitative changes during the development of not only T lymphocytes (15von Boehmer H. Fehling H.J. Annu. Rev.

Concerning CD3, different ratios of CD3γ and CD3δ polypeptides in TCR-CD3 complexes from different T cell lines have been reported (9Alarcón B. Ley S.C. Sánchez-Madrid F. Blumberg R.S. Ju S.T. Fresno M. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD3δ chains are absent, and there are wide differences in CD3γ chain glycosylation in γδ T cells (16Hayes S.M. Laky K. El-Khoury D. Kappes D.J. Fowlkes B.J. Love P.E. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196 (Correction (2002) J. Exp. Med.196, 1653): 1355-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Even so, TCRγδ-CD3 complexes contain two CD3ɛγ dimers per complex (8Hayes S.M. Love P.E. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). TCR-CD3 complexes naturally form aggregates, the degree of aggregation of which within one cell or among T cells cannot be easily ascribed to the nature of the TCR antigen recognition unit (7Schamel W.W.A. Arechaga I. Risueño R.M. van Santen H.M. Cabezas P. Risco C. Valpuesta J.M. Alarcón B. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 17Hellwig S. Schamel W.W.A. Pflugfelder U. Gerlich B. Weltzien H.U. Immunobiology. 2005; 210: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Differences in TCR-CD3 structure among human or mouse T cell lines have been also detected biochemically and by differences in their relative recognition by anti-TCR or anti-CD3 antibodies (18Criado G. Feito M.J. Ojeda G. Sánchez A. Janeway Jr., C.A. Portolés P. Rojo J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 19Zapata D.A. Pacheco-Castro A. Torres P.S. Ramiro A.R. San José E. Alarcón B. Alibaud L. Rubin B. Toribio M.L. Regueiro J.R. J. Biol.

All these differences might have important functional consequences if they can alter the factors determining the efficiency of TCR-mediated signals. These include the efficiency of spontaneous (7Schamel W.W.A. Arechaga I. Risueño R.M. van Santen H.M. Cabezas P. Risco C. Valpuesta J.M. Alarcón B. J. Exp.

Immunobiology. 2005; 210: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or ligand-induced oligomerization/polymerization of TCR-CD3 complexes, the sensitivity to induction of conformational changes upon ligand binding (21Gil D. Schamel W.W.A. Montoya M. Sánchez-Madrid F. Alarcón B. Cell. 2002; 109: 901-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and the efficiency of coreceptor association with the TCR-CD3 complex (22Suzuki S. Kupsch J. Eichmann K. Saizawa M.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2475-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Doucey M-A. Goffin L. Naeher D. Michielin O. Baumgaörtner P. Guillaume P. Palmer E. Luescher I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3257-3264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In turn, these differences could correlate with the amount and distribution of molecules involved in the activation of distinct pathways and/or the threshold and kinetic patterns of T cell activation. In a previous study (18Criado G. Feito M.J. Ojeda G. Sánchez A. Janeway Jr., C.A. Portolés P. Rojo J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we detected differences in the recognition of mouse CD3 by monoclonal antibodies that were linked to differences in the N-terminal sequence of CD3ɛ as determined by recognition with an N-terminal peptide-specific antibody. These differences were not due to alternative splicing of the mini-exons coding for the N-terminal sequence of CD3ɛ, but were due to degradation by proteinases (including metalloproteinases) sensitive to phenanthroline. Interestingly, the association of CD3 with the TCR is weaker when CD3ɛ N-terminal sequences are degraded (18Criado G. Feito M.J. Ojeda G. Sánchez A. Janeway Jr., C.A. Portolés P. Rojo J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Here, we have taken advantage of the presence of negatively charged amino acid residues in the N-terminal sequence of CD3ɛ to further analyze this phenomenon. Removal of these charged residues should affect the isoelectric point of CD3ɛ, rendering isoforms with distinct pI values that could be distinguished by two-dimensional PAGE. Furthermore, we have generated mutant CD3ɛ chains lacking charged amino acids and showed that their loss can enhance the response to TCR-mediated activation. Antibodies and Other Reagents—The following antibodies were used: 3D3 (clonotypic anti-D10 TCR, mouse IgG1) (24Kaye J. Porcelli S. Tite J. Jones B. Janeway Jr., C.A. J. Exp.

Where indicated, the purified antibodies were conjugated with biotin, fluorescein, or DyLight 649 using N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) or with DyLight 649 N-hydroxysuccinimidoester (Pierce) by standard procedures or as indicated by the manufacturer. Hamster anti-mouse CD28 antibody 37.51, anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY-20, and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse interferon-γ (IFN-γ) antibody XMG1.2 were from Pharmingen. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the mouse CD3ɛ extracellular domain and ZAP-70 have been described (31Jiménez-Periañez A. Ojeda G. Criado G. Sánchez A. Pini E. Madrenas J. Rojo J.M. Portolés P.

Rabbit antiserum against a peptide comprising Gly50– Gly63 of mouse CD4 was raised by immunizing with the peptide coupled to ovalbumin. All these rabbit antibodies were affinity-purified over columns of the immunizing antigen coupled to CNBr-Sepharose. Rabbit anti-phosphothreonine/phosphotyrosine ERK antibody was from Promega Corp. Rabbit anti-ERK2 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG, protein A, and ExtrAvidin were from Sigma. Phenanthroline, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and brefeldin were from Sigma; ionomycin was from Calbiochem. Cells and Cell Lines—The mouse Th2 T cell lines SR.D10 (D10) (33Ojeda G. Ronda M.

AE103 is an I-Ak-specific Th1 clone (37Yagi J. Baron J. Buxser S. Janeway Jr., C.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 892-901PubMed Google Scholar). They were cultured and grown as described previously in detail (18Criado G. Feito M.J. Ojeda G. Sánchez A. Janeway Jr., C.A. Portolés P. Rojo J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Spleen and thymus cell suspensions were obtained from BALB/c mice. Plasmids and Transfectants—A mouse CD3ɛ cDNA (nucleotides 69–650 of GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number NM007648, including the mouse CD3ɛ open reading frame between nucleotides 80 and 649) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from total RNA extracted from SR.D10 cells using oligonucleotides 5′-GAGAGAGAATTCTGAGAGGATGCGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTCAGACTGCTCTCTGATTCAGGCC-3′ (antisense). The amplified cDNA was ligated into the pTA-TOPO plasmid vector (Invitrogen). A C-terminal sequence tag for five residues of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein was introduced by PCR amplification using the CD3ɛ cDNA cloned in pTA-TOPO as a template and primers 5′-GAGAGAGAATTCTGAGAGGATGCGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGGAATTCTCATTTGCCAAGCCGGTTGACTGCTCTCTGATTCAGGCC-3′ (antisense). The PCR product was digested with the restriction enzyme EcoRI and ligated into the pSRα vector (pSRα/CD3ɛ-VSV). The insert was extracted using EcoRI and ligated into the bicistronic pIRES2-EGFP expression vector (Clontech). This plasmid (pIRES2-EGFP/CD3ɛ) was grown in Escherichia coli DH5α, purified, and sequenced. A cDNA coding for CD3ɛ with three acidic N-terminal residues (Asp2, Asp3, Glu5) mutated to Gly by A-to-G substitutions in the relevant codons was obtained using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pSRα/CD3ɛ-VSV as template and primers 5′-GGCACTTGCCAGGGCGGTGCCGGGAACATTGGATACAAAGTCTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGAGACTTTGTATCCAATGTTCCCGGCACCGCCCTGGCAAGTGCC-3′ (antisense). The plasmid containing the mutant CD3ɛ DNA was grown and sequenced as described above to confirm the mutations. After digestion with EcoRI, the insert was subcloned into the pIRES2-EGFP vector to generate the pIRES2-EGFP/CD3ɛMUT expression vector. AE103 cells (2 × 106/100 μl) were transfected with 2 μg of DNA of the bicistronic expression vectors pIRES2-EGFP, pIRES2-EGFP/CD3ɛ, and pIRES2-EGFP/CD3ɛMUT using program O-17 of Nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystems). Stable transfectants were selected with Geneticin, and the transfectants were checked for green fluorescent protein and TCR expression. Cell Activation—For antigen activation, 104 T cells were cultured in Click’s medium supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum (culture medium) in 96-well plates (Costar) with mitomycin C-treated 105 B10.BR spleen cells as antigen-presenting cells plus the indicated concentrations of conalbumin-(134–146) peptide. Antigen-presenting cells were previously depleted of T cells by incubation with anti-CD90 antibody and rabbit complement. After 72 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, proliferation was determined by a colorimetric assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide as described (38Sánchez A. Feito M.J. Rojo J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2439-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For activation with pervanadate, a pervanadate solution was prepared by adding 5 μl of 1 m H2O2 to 1 ml of 5 mm NaVO4 (pH 7.0) in culture medium that was left for 20 min at room temperature. Pervanadate was then added to cells in culture medium (10 μl of pervanadate solution/100 μl of cells at 108 cells/ml). After 5 min of incubation at 37 °C in a water bath, the reaction was stopped with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm NaVO4. To determine early activation events in SR.D10 cells, anti-TCR antibody 3D3 or a control antibody was adsorbed (5 μg/ml) to polystyrene microbeads. These beads were mixed with cells (107 in 100 μl of culture medium/sample) at a 1:1 ratio as described (32Feito M.J. Vaschetto R. Criado G. Sánchez A. Chiocchetti A. Jiménez-Periañez A. Dianzani U. Portolés M.P. Rojo J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in a water bath, and the reaction was stopped with ice-cold PBS, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm NaVO4. For intracellular detection of IFN-γ in AE103 transfectants, cells were incubated at 37 °C in 24-well culture plates precoated with anti-TCR antibody F23.1 (10 μg/ml, 106 cells/ml of culture medium, 1 ml/well, in the presence of 10 μg/ml anti-CD28 antibody). After 90 min of incubation at 37 °C, brefeldin (10 μg/ml) was added. For TCR-independent activation, the cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (20 ng/ml) plus 1 μm ionomycin. Surface Biotinylation—Cells (10–20 × 106 cells/ml, 1 ml/sample) were washed with cold PBS and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES and 150 mm NaCl (pH 8.8). The cells were then vectorially biotinylated with N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) as described in detail (39Portolés P. Rojo J.M. Janeway Jr., C.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 129: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation, Isoelectric Focusing (IEF), and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitations of cell-surface TCR or CD3 were performed with 2 × 107 cells/determination as described (18Criado G. Feito M.J. Ojeda G. Sánchez A. Janeway Jr., C.A. Portolés P. Rojo J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with antibodies in cold PBS containing 2% inactivated fetal calf serum and 0.1% sodium azide (staining buffer). Unbound antibodies were washed, and the cells were lysed on ice for 30 min with lysis buffer (1 ml/107 cells; 10 mm CHAPS in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.6) containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm NaVO4). After centrifugation, post-nuclear lysates were precleared by rotation with an irrelevant antibody coupled to Sepharose and centrifuged, and immunoprecipitation was carried out for 2 h at 4 °C by rotation of the precleared supernatants with affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse or anti-rat antibodies coupled to Sepharose as appropriate. The immunoprecipitates were eventually washed five times with cold wash buffer (2 mm CHAPS in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.6) containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm NaVO4) and extracted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoprecipitations from cell lysates were performed as above, except that precipitation was performed with anti-rat antibodies coupled to Sepharose beads previously incubated with rat anti-CD3 antibody YCD3-1 (3 μg/sample) and washed. For IEF, the last immunoprecipitation wash was done with distilled water, and the immunoprecipitates were extracted with 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% Triton X-100, and 100 mm dithiothreitol plus ampholytes (Bio-Lyte 3–10, Bio-Rad) and bromphenol blue. The extracted samples were used to rehydrate polyacrylamide IEF strips (7-cm ReadyStrip™ immobilized pH gradient strips (pH 3–10), Bio-Rad). After active rehydration of the strips (12 h, 500 V), IEF was performed for 15 min at 250 V, for 1 h at 1000 V, for 1 h at 8000 V, and at 500 V for the time needed to achieve 8000–13,000 V-h. The strips were then incubated at room temperature for 10 min each with 6 m urea, 2% SDS, 375 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 20% glycerol, 130 mm dithiothreitol, and bromphenol blue and then with 6 m urea, 2% SDS, 375 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 20% glycerol, 135 mm iodoacetamide, and bromphenol blue. Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates and lysates was performed as described (32Feito M.J. Vaschetto R. Criado G. Sánchez A. Chiocchetti A. Jiménez-Periañez A. Dianzani U. Portolés M.P. Rojo J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A for immunoprecipitates, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ExtrAvidin for biotinylated samples, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG for cell lysates. Surface and Intracellular Staining and Flow Cytometry—For surface staining, cells (0.5 × 106/sample in 0.05 ml of cold staining buffer) were incubated for 30 min on ice with biotinylated antibodies. After washing with staining buffer, the cells were incubated for an additional 30 min on ice with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin in staining buffer plus fluorescein isothiocyanate- or DyLight 649-coupled antibodies as indicated. The cells were washed and analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics). Three-color analysis of thymus populations was performed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with CellQuest acquisition and analysis software. For intracellular staining, cells (2 × 106) were washed with cold PBS and fixed for 5 min with 0.25 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. After adding 1 ml of PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% sodium azide, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) (PBS/bovine serum albumin), the cells were spun and frozen at –70 °C in PBS and 10% Me2SO until used. The cells were washed with 0.1% saponin (Sigma) in PBS/bovine serum albumin (PBS/saponin) and blocked at 4 °C for 30 min with 5% nonfat milk in PBS/saponin. The cells were then stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IFN-γ antibody XMG1.2 in 5% nonfat milk in PBS/saponin for 30 in the cold. After washing three times with PBS/saponin, the cells were analyzed as described above. CD3ɛ Isoforms with Different pI Values Are Detected in TCR-CD3 Complexes on the Surface of CD4+ T cells—Our previous data suggested that one anti-CD3 antibody (YCD3-1) has different avidity for CD3 expressed by different CD4+ T cells (18Criado G. Feito M.J. Ojeda G. Sánchez A. Janeway Jr., C.A. Portolés P. Rojo J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Particularly, it binds with high avidity to CD3 expressed by the SR.D10 cell line, whereas its avidity is low for CD3 in AE103 cells. In contrast, other anti-CD3 antibodies (i.e. 500A2) or anti-TCR antibodies show no major differences in avidity for the same cells (18Criado G. Feito M.J. Ojeda G. Sánchez A. Janeway Jr., C.A. Portolés P. Rojo J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). High avidity of antibody YCD3-1 correlates with higher N-terminal degradation by metalloproteinases as determined using anti-CD3ɛ N-terminal peptide antibodies and proteinase inhibitors such as phenanthroline. CD3ɛ chains from different species, including mouse, possess negatively charged amino acid residues in their N-terminal sequence that affect their predicted pI values (Fig. 1A). We reasoned that CD3ɛ immunoprecipitates from different mouse T cell lines and/or using different anti-CD3 or anti-TCR antibodies should show distinct patterns of CD3ɛ chain isoforms, which could be distinguished by IEF. Because antibody 500A2 showed little variation among T cells in terms of avidity, immunoprecipitation of CD3 with antibody 500A2 was initially used as a mean to assess the CD3ɛ isoform distribution in AE103 and SR.D10 cells (Fig. 1, B and C, upper panels). Immunoprecipitates were separated by IEF (first dimension) and PAGE (second dimension) and immunoblotted using rabbit anti-mouse CD3ɛ extracellular domain antibodies. As predicted, different CD3ɛ isoforms were present within the pI range for complete chains or chains lacking one or two aspartic acid residues of the N-terminal sequence. The most abundant species in both cell lines had a pI close to 7, fitting the predicted pI for CD3ɛ chains lacking one aspartic acid. However, at a low pI, complete CD3ɛ chains were abundant in AE103 cells, but almost absent in SR.D10 precipitates (Fig. 1, B and C, upper panels). Immunoprecipitation of surface CD3ɛ using antibody YCD3-1 showed that this antibody bound better to isoforms with higher pI values, i.e. those lacking one or two N-terminal aspartic acids. Thus, these isoforms are over-represented in YCD3-1 immunoprecipitates from either AE103 or SR.D10 cells (Fig. 1, B and C; see also Fig. 2A), in agreement with the predicted behavior of this antibody based on our previous data (18Criado G. Feito M.J. Ojeda G. Sánchez A. Janeway Jr., C.A. Portolés P. Rojo J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our previous results also suggested that the less degraded CD3ɛ chains maintain strong ties with the TCR, whereas TCR–CD3 bonds are looser for degraded CD3ɛ chains (18Criado G. Feito M.J. Ojeda G. Sánchez A. Janeway Jr., C.A. Portolés P. Rojo J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in immunoprecipitates of surface TCR from SR.D10 cells. Indeed, as depicted in Fig. 1C (lower panel), despite the low proportion of complete low pI CD3ɛ chains among CD3 chains from SR.D10 cells observed in anti-CD3 precipitates (upper and middle panels), these low pI chains coprecipitated very efficiently w"
