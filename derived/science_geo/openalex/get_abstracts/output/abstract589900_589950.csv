https://openalex.org/W3098152251,"Quantum spin Hall (QSH) materials promise revolutionary device applications based on dissipationless propagation of spin currents. They are two-dimensional (2D) representatives of the family of topological insulators, which exhibit conduction channels at their edges inherently protected against scattering. Initially predicted for graphene, and eventually realized in HgTe quantum wells, in the QSH systems realized so far, the decisive bottleneck preventing applications is the small bulk energy gap of less than 30 meV, requiring cryogenic operation temperatures in order to suppress detrimental bulk contributions to the edge conductance. Room-temperature functionalities, however, require much larger gaps. Here we show how this can be achieved by making use of a new QSH paradigm based on substrate-supported atomic monolayers of a high-Z element. Experimentally, the material is synthesized as honeycomb lattice of bismuth atoms, forming ""bismuthene"", on top of the wide-gap substrate SiC(0001). Consistent with the theoretical expectations, the spectroscopic signatures in experiment display a huge gap of ~0.8 eV in bismuthene, as well as conductive edge states. The analysis of the layer-substrate orbitals arrives at a QSH phase, whose topological gap - as a hallmark mechanism - is driven directly by the atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Our results demonstrate how strained artificial lattices of heavy atoms, in contact with an insulating substrate, can be utilized to evoke a novel topological wide-gap scenario, where the chemical potential is located well within the global system gap, ensuring pure edge state conductance. We anticipate future experiments on topological signatures, such as transport measurements that probe the QSH effect via quantized universal conductance, notably at room temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2732924043,"Type III CRISPR-Cas systems in prokaryotes provide immunity against invading nucleic acids through the coordinated degradation of transcriptionally active DNA and its transcripts by the Csm effector complex. The Cas10 subunit of the complex contains an HD nuclease domain that is responsible for DNA degradation and two Palm domains with elusive functions. In addition, Csm6, a ribonuclease that is not part of the complex, is also required to provide full immunity. We show here that target RNA binding by the Csm effector complex of Streptococcus thermophilus triggers Cas10 to synthesize cyclic oligoadenylates (cA n ; n = 2 to 6) by means of the Palm domains. Acting as signaling molecules, cyclic oligoadenylates bind Csm6 to activate its nonspecific RNA degradation. This cyclic oligoadenylate-based signaling pathway coordinates different components of CRISPR-Cas to prevent phage infection and propagation."

Research leading to effective treatments has been hampered by a lack of informative animal models. Ho et al. identified ELABELA as a hormone produced by the placenta whose levels are lower in preeclampsia (see the Perspective by Wirka and Quertermous). ELABELA-deficient pregnant mice showed clinical signs of preeclampsia, including high blood pressure and elevated urine protein. A proportion of embryos lacking ELABELA displayed defective heart development, and full-term pups had low birth weights. Science , this issue p. 707 ; see also p. 643"
https://openalex.org/W2732446419,"Strong under pressure Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a member of the herpesvirus family that can cause life-threatening infections in those who are immunocompromised. HCMV encodes a genome that is about 50% larger than that of herpes simplex virus 1 (the virus that causes cold sores), but these two viruses have similar-sized capsids. Yu et al. used cryo–electron microscopy to determine the structure of the HCMV capsid to 3.9-Å resolution. This is the first high-resolution capsid structure from the herpesvirus family. It reveals extensive interactions that stabilize the capsid to withstand the high pressure that comes from accommodating such a large genome. Science , this issue p. eaam6892"
https://openalex.org/W2725555515,"Background Newer 2D strain software has a potential to assess layer-specific strain. However, normal reference values for layer-specific strain have not been established. We aimed to establish the normal ranges of layer-specific longitudinal and circumferential strain (endocardial global longitudinal strain (GLS), transmural GLS, epicardial GLS, endocardial global circumferential strain (GCS), transmural GCS, and epicardial GCS). Methods and results We retrospectively analyzed longitudinal and circumferential strain parameters in 235 healthy subjects, with use of layer-specific 2D speckle tracking software (GE). The endocardial strain/epicardial strain (Endo/Epi) ratio was also measured to assess the strain gradient across the myocardium. The endocardial, transmural, and epicardial GLS values and the Endo/Epi ratio in the normal subjects were -23.1±2.3, -20.0±2.0, -17.6±1.9, and 1.31±0.07, respectively. The corresponding values of GCS were -28.5±3.0, -20.8±2.3, -15.3±2.0, and 1.88±0.17, respectively. The layer-specific global strain parameters exhibited no age dependency but did exhibit gender dependency except for endocardial GCS. A subgroup analysis revealed that basal and middle levels of endocardial LS was decreased in the middle and elderly aged group. However, apical endocardial LS was preserved even in the elderly subjects. Conclusions We proposed normal reference values for layer-specific strain based on both age and gender. This detailed strain analysis provides layer-oriented information with the potential to characterize abnormal findings in various cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2729233640,"The development of ectothermic embryos is strongly affected by incubation temperature, and thermal imprinting of body growth and muscle phenotype has been reported in various teleost fishes. The complex epigenetic regulation of muscle development in vertebrates involves DNA methylation of the myogenin promoter. Body growth is a heritable and highly variable trait among fish populations that allows for local adaptations, but also for selective breeding. Here we studied the epigenetic effects of embryonic temperature and genetic background on body growth, muscle cellularity and myogenin expression in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Eggs from salmon families with either high or low estimated breeding values for body growth, referred to as Fast and Slow genotypes, were incubated at 8°C or 4°C until the embryonic ‘eyed-stage’ followed by rearing at the production temperature of 8°C. Rearing temperature strongly affected the growth rates, and the 8°C fish were about twice as heavy as the 4°C fish in the order Fast8>Slow8>Fast4>Slow4 prior to seawater transfer. Fast8 was the largest fish also at harvest despite strong growth compensation in the low temperature groups. Larval myogenin expression was approximately 4–6 fold higher in the Fast8 group than in the other groups and was associated with relative low DNA methylation levels, but was positively correlated with the expression levels of the DNA methyltransferase genes dnmt1, dnmt3a and dnmt3b. Juvenile Fast8 fish displayed thicker white muscle fibres than Fast4 fish, while Slow 8 and Slow 4 showed no difference in muscle cellularity. The impact of genetic background on the thermal imprinting of body growth and muscle development in Atlantic salmon suggests that epigenetic variation might play a significant role in the local adaptation to fluctuating temperatures over short evolutionary time."
https://openalex.org/W2732706304,"This research proposes an innovative data model to determine the landscape of emerging technologies. It is based on a competitive technology intelligence methodology that incorporates the assessment of scientific publications and patent analysis production, and is further supported by experts’ feedback. It enables the definition of the growth rate of scientific and technological output in terms of the top countries, institutions and journals producing knowledge within the field as well as the identification of main areas of research and development by analyzing the International Patent Classification codes including keyword clusterization and co-occurrence of patent assignees and patent codes. This model was applied to the evolving domain of 3D bioprinting. Scientific documents from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, along with patents from 27 authorities and 140 countries, were retrieved. In total, 4782 scientific publications and 706 patents were identified from 2000 to mid-2016. The number of scientific documents published and patents in the last five years showed an annual average growth of 20% and 40%, respectively. Results indicate that the most prolific nations and institutions publishing on 3D bioprinting are the USA and China, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (USA), Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) and Tsinghua University (China), respectively. Biomaterials and Biofabrication are the predominant journals. The most prolific patenting countries are China and the USA; while Organovo Holdings Inc. (USA) and Tsinghua University (China) are the institutions leading. International Patent Classification codes reveal that most 3D bioprinting inventions intended for medical purposes apply porous or cellular materials or biologically active materials. Knowledge clusters and expert drivers indicate that there is a research focus on tissue engineering including the fabrication of organs, bioinks and new 3D bioprinting systems. Our model offers a guide to researchers to understand the knowledge production of pioneering technologies, in this case 3D bioprinting."
https://openalex.org/W2726223636,"Experimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to plants on the Earth. Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2731202217,"Cells that form the corneal epithelium, the outermost layer of the cornea, are exposed to shear stress through blinking during waking hours. In this in vitro study, the effect of fluid shear stress on human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) was investigated. Following exposure to shear stresses of 4 and 8 dyn/cm2, HCECs showed cytoskeletal rearrangement with more prominent, organized and elongated filamentous actin. Cytoskeletal changes were time-dependent, and were most significant after 24 hours of shear stress. Higher rates of migration and proliferation, as evaluated by a scratch assay, were also observed following 24 hours of low shear stress exposure (4 dyn/cm2). This result contrasted the poor migration observed in samples scratched before shear exposure, indicating that shear-induced cytoskeletal changes played a key role in improved wound healing and must therefore precede any damage to the cell layer. HCEC cytoskeletal changes were accompanied by an upregulation in integrin β1 and downregulation of ICAM-1. These results demonstrate that HCECs respond favourably to flow-induced shear stress, impacting their proliferation and migration properties as well as phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2728033777,"Objectives Among a variety of relevant factors of osteoporosis, the association between alcohol intake and postmenopausal women’s bone mineral density (BMD) by using data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was evaluated in this study. Materials and methods Among a total of 31,596 subjects, males, premenopausal women, participants without BMD data were excluded. Finally, a total number of subjects in the study was 3,312. The frequency and amount of alcohol intake were determined by self-reported questionnaires, and BMD was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Results Mean femoral BMD for light drinkers was statistically significantly greater than that for heavy drinkers and non-drinkers. We observed the characteristic trends for BMD by drinking frequency; the mean BMD gradually increased from non-drinkers to the participants who drank 2–3 times per week; these participants exhibited the highest BMD. Participants who drank alcohol greater than 4 times per week showed a lower BMD. In the risk factor analysis, the adjusted odds ratio for osteoporosis (at femoral neck) was 1.68 in non-drinkers and 1.70 in heavy drinkers compared with light drinkers. Conclusions Light alcohol intake (2–3 times per week and 1–2 or 5–6 glasses per occasion) in South Korean postmenopausal women was related to high femoral BMD. Non-drinkers and heavy drinkers had approximately a 1.7-times greater risk for osteoporosis than light drinkers."
https://openalex.org/W2728502257,"In this work, we developed a device capable to generate a non-thermal plasma discharge inside a sealed bag. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the oxygen, nitrogen and argon plasma sterilization on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis spores according to the NF EN 556 Norm. Moreover the bag integrity which is a critical key to maintain the sterile state of items after the end of the process was verified by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometry (XPS) analyses. After plasma treatments, the bacterial counting showed a 6 log reduction of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in 45 min and 120 min respectively whatever the gas used and a 4 log reduction of B. subtilis spores in 120 min with only oxygen plasma. These results were confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observations showing altered bacteria or spores and numerous debris. Taking into account the studied microorganisms, the oxygen plasma treatment showed the highest efficiency. FTIR and XPS analyses showed that this treatment induced no significant modification of the bags. To conclude this non-thermal plasma sterilization technique could be an opportunity to sterilize heat and chemical-sensitive medical devices and to preserve their sterile state after the end of the process."
https://openalex.org/W2733723768,"A wide variety of drugs bind to human serum albumin (HSA) at its two principal sites, namely site I and site II. A number of reports indicate that drug binding to these two binding sites are not completely independent, and that interactions between ligands of these two discrete sites can play a role. In this study, the effect of the binding of long-chain fatty acids on the interactive binding between dansyl-L-asparagine (DNSA; site I ligand) and ibuprofen (site II ligand) at pH6.5 was examined. Binding experiments showed that the binding of sodium oleate (Ole) to HSA induces conformational changes in the molecule, which, in turn, changes the individual binding of DNSA and ibuprofen, as well as the mode of interaction between these two ligands from a 'competitive-like' allosteric interaction in the case of the defatted HSA conformer to a 'nearly independent' binding in the case of non-defatted HSA conformer. Circular dichroism measurements indicated that ibuprofen and Ole are likely to modify the spatial orientation of DNSA at its binding site. Docking simulations suggest that the long-distance electric repulsion between DNSA and ibuprofen on defatted HSA contributes to a 'competitive-like' allosteric interaction, whereas extending the distance between ligands and/or increasing the flexibility or size of the DNSA binding site in fatted HSA evokes a change in the interaction mode to 'nearly independent' binding. The present findings provide further insights into the structural dynamics of HSA upon the binding of fatty acids, and its effects on drug binding and drug-drug interactions that occur on HSA."
https://openalex.org/W2684302385,"The toxicity of in vitro tested compounds is usually evaluated based on AC50 values calculated from dose-response curves. However, there is a large group of compounds for which a standard four-parametric sigmoid curve fitting may be inappropriate for estimating AC50. In the present study, 22 polyphenol-rich compounds were prioritized from the least to the most toxic based on the total area under and over the dose-response curves (AUOC) in relation to baselines. The studied compounds were ranked across three key cell indicators (mitochondrial membrane potential, cell membrane integrity and nuclear size) in a panel of five cell lines (HepG2, Caco-2, A549, HMEC-1, and 3T3), using a high-content screening (HCS) assay. Regarding AUOC score values, naringin (negative control) was the least toxic phenolic compound. Aronox, spent hop extract and kale leaf extract had very low cytotoxicity with regard to mitochondrial membrane potential and cell membrane integrity, as well as nuclear morphology (nuclear area). Kaempferol (positive control) exerted strong cytotoxic effects on the mitochondrial and nuclear compartments. Extracts from buckthorn bark, walnut husk and hollyhock flower were highly cytotoxic with regard to the mitochondrion and cell membrane, but not the nucleus. We propose an alternative algorithm for the screening of a large number of agents and for identifying those with adverse cellular effects at an early stage of drug discovery, using high content screening analysis. This approach should be recommended for series of compounds producing a non-sigmoidal cell response, and for agents with unknown toxicity or mechanisms of action."
https://openalex.org/W2728457793,"Background Monitoring respiratory status using end tidal CO2 (EtCO2), which reliably reflects arterial PaCO2 in intubated patients under general anesthesia, has often proven both inaccurate and inadequate when monitoring non-intubated and spontaneously breathing patients. This is particularly important in patients undergoing procedural sedation (e.g., endoscopy, colonoscopy). This can be undertaken in the operating theater, but is also often delivered outside the operating room by non-anesthesia providers. In this study we evaluated the ability for conventional EtCO2 monitoring to reflect changes in ventilation in non-intubated surgical patients undergoing monitored anesthesia care and compared and contrasted these findings to both intubated patients under general anesthesia and spontaneously breathing volunteers. Methods Minute Ventilation (MV), tidal volume (TV), and respiratory rate (RR) were continuously collected from an impedance-based Respiratory Volume Monitor (RVM) simultaneously with capnography data in 160 patients from three patient groups: non-intubated surgical patients managed using spinal anesthesia and Procedural Sedation (n = 58); intubated surgical patients under General Anesthesia (n = 54); and spontaneously breathing Awake Volunteers (n = 48). EtCO2 instrument sensitivity was calculated for each patient as the slope of a Deming regression between corresponding measurements of EtCO2 and MV and expressed as angle from the x-axis (θ). All data are presented as mean ± SD unless otherwise indicated. Results While, as expected, EtCO2 and MV measurements were negatively correlated in most patients, we found gross systematic differences across the three cohorts. In the General Anesthesia patients, small changes in MV resulted in large changes in EtCO2 (high sensitivity, θ = -83.6 ± 9.9°). In contrast, in the Awake Volunteers patients, large changes in MV resulted in insignificant changes in EtCO2 (low sensitivity, θ = -24.7 ± 19.7°, p < 0.0001 vs General Anesthesia). In the Procedural Sedation patients, EtCO2 sensitivity showed a bimodal distribution, with an approximately even split between patients showing high EtCO2 instrument sensitivity, similar to those under General Anesthesia, and patients with low EtCO2 instrument sensitivity, similar to the Awake Volunteers. Conclusions When monitoring non-intubated patients undergoing procedural sedation, EtCO2 often provides inadequate instrument sensitivity when detecting changes in ventilation. This suggests that augmenting standard patient care with EtCO2 monitoring is a less than optimal solution for detecting changes in respiratory status in non-intubated patients. Instead, adding direct monitoring of MV with an RVM may be preferable for continuous assessment of adequacy of ventilation in non-intubated patients."
https://openalex.org/W2728994415,"While previous studies have shown that muscle stretching suppresses monosynaptic spinal reflex excitability in stretched muscles, its effects on non-stretched muscles is still largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of muscle stretching on monosynaptic spinal reflex in non-stretched muscles. Ten healthy male subjects participated in this study. Muscle stretching of the right triceps surae muscle was performed using a motor torque device for 1 minute. Three different dorsiflexion torques (at approximately 5, 10, and 15 Nm) were applied during muscle stretching. Spinal reflexes evoked by transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation were recorded in both the lower-limb muscles before, during, and at 0 and 5 min following muscle stretching. The amplitudes of the spinal reflexes in both the stretched and non-stretched muscles in the right (ipsilateral) leg were smaller during stretching compared to before, and at 0 and 5 min after stretching. Furthermore, the degree of reduction in the amplitude of the spinal reflexes in the right (ipsilateral) leg muscles increased significantly as the dorsiflexion torque (i.e., stretching of the right triceps surae muscles) increased. In contrast, reduction in the amplitude of the spinal reflexes with increasing dorsiflexion torque was not seen in the left (contralateral) leg muscles. Our results clearly indicate that muscle stretching has inhibitory effects on monosynaptic spinal reflexes, not only in stretched muscles, but also in non-stretched muscles of the ipsilateral leg."
https://openalex.org/W2726420419,"Background It is crucial to find a balance between functional and oncological outcome when choosing an adequate method for the management of vocal fold leukoplakia. Therefore, a detailed examination is a milestone in the decision-making process. Aim To examine whether narrow-band imaging (NBI) can be helpful in vocal fold assessment in the case of leukoplakia and how to overcome the “umbrella effect”- understood as the submucosal vascular pattern hidden under the plaque. Material and methods Prospective cohort of 41 consecutive patients. Inclusion criteria: vocal fold leukoplakia, no previous procedures (surgery, radiotherapy), and preoperative endoscopy with an optical filter for NBI. Two groups: “suspicious” and “normal”, according to the submucosal microvascular pattern of peripheral regions of the mucosa surrounding the plaque, were distinguished. Patients were qualified for a full-thickness or partial-thickness biopsy, respectively. Criteria defining suspected characters were well-demarcated brownish areas with scattered brown spots corresponding to type IV, Va, Vb, and Vc NI classifications. Results In 22/41 (53.7%) patients with “suspected” microvascular pattern, full-thickness biopsy was performed. Moderate and severe dysplasia was revealed in 15 type IV and 7 type Va NI patients. In 19/41 (46.3%) patients with proper NBI vessel pattern treated by partial-thickness biopsy, hyperkeratosis was diagnosed. There was a strong correlation between the NBI pattern and final histology: Chi2 (2) = 41.0 (p = 0.0000). Conclusion The results demonstrate that NBI endoscopic assessment of the submucosal microvascular pattern of mucosa surrounding the plaque can be an effective method to categorise the risk in vocal fold leukoplakia prior to treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2726361878,"Objective Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) have shown to be effective interventions for treating depressive symptoms in patients with diabetes. However, little is known about which intervention works best for whom (i.e., moderators of efficacy). The aim of this study was to identify variables that differentially predicted response to either CBT or MBCT (i.e., prescriptive predictors). Methods The sample consisted of 91 adult outpatients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and comorbid depressive symptoms (i.e., BDI-II ≥ 14) who were randomized to either individual 8-week CBT (n = 45) or individual 8-week MBCT (n = 46). Patients were followed for a year and depressive symptoms were measured at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 9-months follow-up. The predictive effect of demographics, depression related characteristics, and disease specific characteristics on change in depressive symptoms was assessed by means of hierarchical regression analyses. Results Analyses showed that education was the only factor that differentially predicted a decrease in depressive symptoms directly after the interventions. At post-treatment, individuals with higher educational attainment responded better to MBCT, as compared to CBT. Yet, this effect was not apparent at 9-months follow-up. Conclusions This study did not identify variables that robustly differentially predicted treatment effectiveness of CBT and MBCT, indicating that both CBT and MBCT are accessible interventions that are effective for treating depressive symptoms in broad populations with diabetes. More research is needed to guide patient-treatment matching in clinical practice."

They belong to the AB5 virulence factors, which bind to glycans on host cell membranes for internalization. Host cell recognition and internalization are mediated by toxin B subunits sharing a unique pentameric ring-like assembly. Although the role of pertussis toxin in whooping cough is well-established, pertussis-like toxins produced by other bacteria are less studied, and their mechanisms of action are unclear. Here, we report that some extra-intestinal Escherichia coli pathogens (i.e. those that reside in the gut but can spread to other bodily locations) encode a pertussis-like toxin that inhibits mammalian cell growth in vitro. We found that this protein, EcPlt, is related to toxins produced by both nontyphoidal and typhoidal Salmonella serovars. Pertussis-like toxins are secreted as disulfide-bonded heterohexamers in which the catalytic ADP-ribosyltransferase subunit is activated when exposed to the reducing environment in mammalian cells. We found here that the reduced EcPlt exhibits large structural rearrangements associated with its activation. We noted that inhibitory residues tethered within the NAD+-binding site by an intramolecular disulfide in the oxidized state dissociate upon the reduction and enable loop restructuring to form the nucleotide-binding site. Surprisingly, although pertussis toxin targets a cysteine residue within the α subunit of inhibitory trimeric G-proteins, we observed that activated EcPlt toxin modifies a proximal lysine/asparagine residue instead.

Pathogenic Escherichia coli strains preferentially inhabit different sites within their hosts, with enteric or extra-intestinal niches presenting distinctly different challenges.

Host cell recognition and internalization are mediated by the toxin B subunits that share a unique pentameric ring-like assembly.

Structure and function of the Salmonella typhi chimaeric A(2)B(5) typhoid toxin.Nature. 2013; 499: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) proteins. Toxin ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) hydrolyze the nicotinamide group from NAD+ and transfer the ADP-ribose moiety onto specific host proteins. Pertussis toxin specifically targets inhibitory trimeric G-proteins by modifying a conserved cysteine located four residues from the C termini of the Gα subunit (13.Katada T. The inhibitory G-protein G(i) identified as pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation.Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2012; 35: 2103-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This modification renders the Gαi/o subunits unable to associate with their cognate G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) thus modulating the host's immune response. A series of related pertussis-like (Plt) toxins exist within the genomes of pathogenic bacteria, including strains of E. coli, Salmonella, and Yersinia. The bacterial strains harboring such virulence factors are diverse, and their evolutionary relationship is complicated due to the spread of these genes on mobile genetic elements. Proteins within the Plt family include the atypical archetype member whose glycan-binding B subunits have expanded and diverged within the B. pertussis genome to form four separate genes yielding a pseudopentameric glycan-binding platform. In contrast, other pertussis-like toxins display a homopentameric glycan-binding stoichiometry. All Plt proteins nonetheless carry a conserved catalytic A subunit. In the secreted state, the enzymatic ART domain of pertussis-like toxins lies atop the five glycan-binding subunits allowing its C terminus to thread through a U-shaped NAD+-binding cleft before plunging into the pore of the B subunit pentamer (7.Song J. Gao X. Galán J.E. Structure and function of the Salmonella typhi chimaeric A(2)B(5) typhoid toxin.Nature. 2013; 499: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 9.Stein P.E. Boodhoo A. Armstrong G.D. Cockle S.A. Klein M.H. Read R.J. The crystal structure of pertussis toxin.Structure. 1994; 2: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). When these C-terminal residues are truncated from pertussis toxin, its ART domain is constitutively active in vitro but is unable to associate with its pseudopentamer or enter cells (14.Locht C. Lobet Y. Feron C. Cieplak W. Keith J.M. The role of cysteine 41 in the enzymatic activities of the pertussis toxin S1 subunit as investigated by site-directed mutagenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4552-4559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic activation in vivo requires proteolytic separation of the inhibitory C terminus and reduction of a connecting disulfide. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying an alternative activation mechanism of cholera toxin are understood (15.O'Neal C.J. Jobling M.G. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G. Structural basis for the activation of cholera toxin by human ARF6-GTP.Science. 2005; 309: 1093-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the changes that occur following activation of a pertussis-like protein have not previously been characterized. Although the association of pertussis toxin with whooping cough is well-established, orthologous pertussis-like toxins present within other pathogenic bacterial infections are less studied, and their mechanism(s) of action are unclear (7.Song J. Gao X. Galán J.E. Structure and function of the Salmonella typhi chimaeric A(2)B(5) typhoid toxin.Nature. 2013; 499: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Here we identify a pertussis-like AB5 protein (EcPltAB) from clinical E. coli isolates that is related to the typhoid and ArtAB toxins observed in typhoidal and nontyphoidal Salmonella serovars. We provide structures that confirm that pertussis-like toxins are secreted as inactive forms in which an intramolecular disulfide holds an occluding C-terminal tail within the NAD+-binding site. This conserved disulfide also serves as a redox switch that senses host cell entry, with reduction of the bond allowing displacement of the occluding C-terminal residues, facilitating NAD+ binding and maturation of catalytic activity. At a global level, the existence of EcPltAB-type proteins, and their relatives (55.Jobling M.G. The chromosomal nature of LT-II entertoxins solved: a lambdoid prophage encodes both LT-II and one of two novel pertussin toxin-like family members in type II enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.Pathog. Dis. 2016; 74 (Apr): ftw001Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) expands the family of known bacterial pertussis-like toxins capable of modulating the human immune system. Furthermore, we show that although AB5 proteins are segregated into evolutionarily related enzyme families, these may not always modify the same residues within host proteins. The frequency with which pathogenic bacterial strains are isolated from clinical settings does not necessarily correlate with their representation in genomic databases, yet it remains a useful proxy measure. We thus determined the prevalence of genes encoding AB5-type toxins among complete and draft E. coli genome sequences available on the NCBI database. E. coli genomes were queried using previously identified A and B subunit sequences. As expected, most genes discovered corresponded to previously known E. coli toxins; by far the most prevalent were the Shiga toxins produced by Shiga toxigenic E. coli, proteins whose action can cause hemolytic-uremic syndrome following infection, identified in 19% of genomes (supplemental Fig. S1). The next most prevalent were toxins from the cholera family LT-I and LT-II heat-labile enterotoxins secreted by enterotoxigenic E. coli (Fig. 1), identified in ∼8% of the genomes. The properties of these enteric E. coli toxins are well-established (4.Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E. Kalk K.H. Wartna E.S. van Zanten B.A. Witholt B. Hol W.G. Crystal structure of a cholera toxin-related heat-labile enterotoxin from E. coli.Nature. 1991; 351: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 5.Zhang R.G. Scott D.L. Westbrook M.L.

Incorporation of a non-human glycan mediates human susceptibility to a bacterial toxin.Nature. 2008; 456: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, the third most common set of AB5 genes identified was a series of related pertussis-like proteins found in ExPEC genomes, particularly from phylogroup B2 (Fig. 1). The B subunit of these toxins shared 69% sequence identity to ArtB and the upstream A subunit 70% identity to ArtA, two components of a pertussis-like toxin produced by Salmonella typhimurium DT104 (16.Saitoh M. Tanaka K. Nishimori K. Makino S. Kanno T. Ishihara R. Hatama S. Kitano R. Kishima M. Sameshima T. Akiba M. Nakazawa M. Yokomizo Y. Uchida I.

In contrast to these Salmonella and Escherichia orthologs, the archetype pertussis toxin has an expanded set of four glycan-binding B subunits (named S2–S5) associated with a single catalytic A or S1 subunit. The Salmonella ArtAB protein is an active ADP-ribosyltransferase (17.Uchida I. Ishihara R. Tanaka K. Hata E. Makino S. Kanno T. Hatama S. Kishima M. Akiba M. Watanabe A. Kubota T. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium DT104 ArtA-dependent modification of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins in the presence of [32P]NAD.Microbiology. 2009; 155: 3710-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereas a related typhoid toxin additionally serves as a cargo carrier for an accessory cytolethal distending toxin (7.Song J. Gao X. Galán J.E. Structure and function of the Salmonella typhi chimaeric A(2)B(5) typhoid toxin.Nature. 2013; 499: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our analysis indicates that the E. coli Plt toxins are more evolutionarily diverse than the currently identified Salmonella variants, with at least three semi-separate lineages sharing between 70 and 80% sequence identity. We refer to the product of these pertussis-like genes as E. coli-pertussis-like toxins (EcPlt). We characterized the EcPlt toxin family by cloning a number of representative members and expressing them using standard recombinant techniques, focusing primarily on the EcPlt genes (E9YZW8 and E9YZW9) cloned from UPEC isolate PA26B. The oxidized EcPltAB holotoxin was purified after co-expressing both subunits using a periplasmic expression system (18.Ng N. Littler D. Le Nours J. Paton A.W. Paton J.C. Rossjohn J. Beddoe T. Cloning, expression, purification and preliminary X-ray diffraction studies of a novel AB toxin.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2013; 69: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The 96-kDa soluble protein complex eluted on gel filtration with a molecular mass consistent with that of an AB5 heterohexameric stoichiometry. To ascertain whether this holotoxin was functional, it was added to human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) or African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero). Mammalian cell lines grown to 40–50% confluency were exposed to different concentrations of EcPltAB (Fig. 2a and supplemental Fig. S2). The characteristic response profile of pertussis toxin involves a slow cellular entry mechanism followed by an accumulative interruption of signaling resulting in clustered growth (19.Hewlett E.L. Sauer K.T. Myers G.A. Cowell J.L. Guerrant R.L. Induction of a novel morphological response in Chinese hamster ovary cells by pertussis toxin.Infect. Immun. 1983; 40: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over an 18-h period, control-treated cells remained unaffected and continued to proliferate, although those exposed to EcPltAB displayed cell clustering and an absence of growth (see supplemental Fig. S2, a–c) compared with buffer-alone controls (supplemental Fig. S2d). Next, we performed a glycan array analysis to determine the specificity of EcPltAB (see supplemental Table S1). Its B subunit displayed avidity for a broad range of branched eukaryotic glycans, especially those with N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) termini, thus implying EcPlt targets a similar range of cell types as typhoid toxin (7.Song J. Gao X. Galán J.E. Structure and function of the Salmonella typhi chimaeric A(2)B(5) typhoid toxin.Nature. 2013; 499: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We next sought to establish which eukaryotic proteins were targeted by EcPltA. The EcPltA toxin shares 50–70% identity with Salmonella ArtA proteins and 31% identity with the pertussis toxin's catalytic S1 subunit, two known ADP-ribosyltransferases that modify the α subunits of inhibitory trimeric GTP-binding proteins (17.Uchida I. Ishihara R. Tanaka K. Hata E. Makino S. Kanno T. Hatama S. Kishima M. Akiba M. Watanabe A. Kubota T. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium DT104 ArtA-dependent modification of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins in the presence of [32P]NAD.Microbiology. 2009; 155: 3710-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20.Katada T. Ui M. Direct modification of the membrane adenylate cyclase system by islet-activating protein due to ADP-ribosylation of a membrane protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1982; 79: 3129-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). We set up an assay to identify equivalent EcPltA substrates by using biotin-conjugated NAD+ as substrate for the toxins. In such assays, ADP-ribosylation also adds a biotin tag to protein substrates that can then be imaged by Western blotting using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Holotoxin (EcPltAB or PT) versions of this assay are dependent upon toxin activation and ADP-ribosylation rate, although when the assay is performed with constitutively active proteins (EcPltA or PT S1), only the ADP-ribosylation rate is measured. Using radiolabeled substrate, other groups (20.Katada T. Ui M. Direct modification of the membrane adenylate cyclase system by islet-activating protein due to ADP-ribosylation of a membrane protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1982; 79: 3129-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) have shown that the PT holotoxin is activated by the presence of ATP and reducing agents. Our own ADP-ribosylation assay recapitulates this result with a 41-kDa band being modified by PT in crudely purified trimeric G-protein brain extracts or Vero cell lysates under identical conditions (Fig. 2). A similar band was observed in reactions containing the EcPltAB holotoxin (Fig. 2). In both reactions, a major band at ∼41 kDa was ADP-ribosylated and migrated close to the molecular weight of PT-treated Gαi proteins (Fig. 2b, left panel). To confirm that EcPltA targeted Gαi subunits, we cloned two HsGαi3 constructs (the most readily expressed isoform): the full-length protein and a more soluble construct lacking the N-terminal aliphatic helix (HsGαi3ΔN). Following expression and purification, full-length HsGαi3 acted as substrate for the toxin's ADP-ribosyltransferase activity and migrated at a similar molecular weight to a band modified in Vero cell extracts, whereas other proteins within the Coomassie-stained lysate did not (Fig. 2b, right panel). Both the full-length protein and Gαi3 ΔN-mutant served equally well as substrates for PT or EcPlt (supplemental Fig. S3), the latter Gαi3ΔN construct was favored for routine assays due to its enhanced stability. PT is responsible for many of the pathogenic features of B. pertussis. However, other Bordetella species also contain ptx-like genes yet fail to produce the toxin because of inactive promoters (21.Hausman S.Z. Cherry J.D. Heininger U. Wirsing von König C.H. Burns D.L. Analysis of proteins encoded by the ptx and ptl genes of Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella parapertussis.Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4020-4026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using our assay, we sought to identify whether ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was detectable in the supernatant of UPEC strain PA26B. UPEC PA26B was cultured in the presence of prophage-inducing agents. After 12 h of growth, bacterial cells were removed by filtration, and the supernatant was tested for ADP-ribosyltransferase activity using HsGαi3ΔN as a substrate. In control reactions employing purified EcPltAB, a robust ADP-ribosyltransferase response was observed using 20 nm pure toxin (Fig. 2c, 1st lane). Prior to commencing the reaction, the supernatant of PA26B cells was seen to contain a natively biotinylated 20-kDa protein, but this was readily distinguishable from our host HsGαi3ΔN target (Fig. 2c, 2nd lane). When HsGαi3ΔN was added to the filtered supernatant of PA26B, we observed ADP-ribosylation of the substrate (Fig. 2c, 3rd lane) suggesting, but not conclusively proving, that EcPltAB is actively expressed. The B subunit of the typhoid toxin impacts cell-signaling pathways independent of its associated catalytic A subunits (22.Wang H. Paton J.C. Herdman B.P. Rogers T.J. Beddoe T. Paton A.W. The B subunit of an AB5 toxin produced by Salmonella enterica serovar typhi up-regulates chemokines, cytokines, and adhesion molecules in human macrophage, colonic epithelial, and brain microvascular endothelial cell lines.Infect. Immun. 2013; 81: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine whether the growth-arrest phenotype induced by EcPltAB resulted from its enzymatic activity, inactivating mutations were incorporated into the A subunit. A highly conserved (Q/E)XE motif is present in many ADP-ribosyltransferases and is essential for activity (23.Antoine R. Tallett A. van Heyningen S. Locht C. Evidence for a catalytic role of glutamic acid 129 in the NAD-glycohydrolase activity of the pertussis toxin S1 subunit.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24149-24155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (residues 116QNE118 in EcPltA). Mutation of residue Glu-118 to an aspartic acid residue resulted in a requirement for 1000-fold higher concentrations of toxin to induce the same level of growth arrest as wild-type EcPltAB toxin (Fig. 2d). Furthermore, a Q116D,E118D double mutant that retains a wild-type B subunit showed no effect on growth and was indistinguishable from control reactions even at 50 μg/ml toxin (Fig. 2d and supplemental Fig. S2e), and as discussed later, this mutant displayed no discernible enzymatic activity (Fig. 7c). EcPltAB thus appears to be expressed by ExPEC, and its ADP-ribosyltransferase activity is cytotoxic to mammalian cells. The presence of ATP, phosphate, and detergent assists with activation of the PT S1 subunit by promoting dissociation from its pseudopentamer and increasing its exposure to the local microenvironment (24.Kaslow H.R. Lim L.K. Moss J. Lesikar D.D. Structure-activity analysis of the activation of pertussis toxin.Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). ATP binds within the central pseudopentameric pore of the pertussis toxin, destabilizing the quaternary structure (25.Hazes B. Boodhoo A. Cockle S.A. Read R.J. Crystal structure of the pertussis toxin-ATP complex: a molecular sensor.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether the activation requirements for the EcPltAB toxin were similar. Our assay recapitulated the finding that reducing agents activate PT and that this process is synergistically enhanced by the presence of ATP (Fig. 3a, 1st to 5th lanes). Like PT, the EcPltAB holotoxin is inactive when oxidized, and higher concentrations of reducing agent result in increased catalytic activity in vitro (Fig. 3a, 6th to 8th lanes). However, ATP did not synergistically enhance this process (in Fig. 3a, 4th lane is 95% more intense than 2nd lane, although the intensities of the 7th and 9th lanes are within 1%). The ATP-binding site of the PT pseudopentamer appears absent within the homopentameric EcPltAB. We examined whether the nature of the reducing agent affected EcPltAB activation by repeating the ADP-ribosylation assays in the presence of intracellular (2 mm) or serum (2 μm) concentrations of glutathione using different redox ratios. Reduced glutathione alone was ∼20% more effective at inducing toxin activation in vitro than an equivalent concentration of TCEP (Fig. 3c), yet even small quantities of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) drastically slowed activation. Thus, although some characteristics are shared, the sequence divergence that exists between pertussis toxin and pertussis-like toxins results in differences in their respective activation mechanisms. PT targets the α subunits of human inhibitory trimeric G-proteins by transferring the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ onto a conserved cysteine four residues from their C termini. PT-sensitive substrates primarily belong to the heterotrimeric Gi/Go protein subfamily, which in humans includes the 40.5-kDa proteins Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαio, as well as the equivalent subunit from transducin. The Salmonella ArtA pertussis-like toxin modifies this same set of proteins (17.Uchida I. Ishihara R. Tanaka K. Hata E. Makino S. Kanno T. Hatama S. Kishima M. Akiba M. Watanabe A. Kubota T.

https://openalex.org/W2724508033,"Lung cancers are the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) being the most aggressive type. At the time of diagnosis, SCLC has usually already metastasized, and an astonishing 95% of patients eventually succumb to the disease. This highlights the need for more effective SCLC screening and treatment options. Interestingly, the earliest and most frequent genetic alteration associated with lung cancers involves a lesion in the region to which the RNA binding protein RBM5 maps. We have recently shown that a decrease in RBM5 expression may be a key step in SCLC development, as RBM5 regulated many transformation-associated processes in SCLC cells. RBM5 is structurally and functionally similar to another RNA binding protein, RBM10. Both proteins have tumor-suppressor properties in a variety of cancer cell lines, and it has been suggested that RBM5 expression can influence RBM10. Due to their similarities, and the recent evidence that RBM10 is mutated in up to 21% of lung cancers, we hypothesized that RBM10 would share RBM5's tumor-suppressor properties in SCLC. Using transcriptome analysis and functional assays, we show, however, that RBM10's function was opposite to what we hypothesized; in the endogenously RBM5-null GLC20 SCLC cell line, RBM10 actually promoted cell proliferation and other transformation-associated processes. Using RNA immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (RIP-Seq) and Western blotting, we demonstrate that RBM5 post-transcriptionally regulated RBM10 expression via direct interaction with specific RBM10 splice variants. We propose a working model describing the impact of this interaction on cellular processes. Our results provide evidence that RBM10 expression, in RBM5-null tumors, may contribute to tumor growth and metastasis. Measurement of both RBM10 and RBM5 expression in clinical samples may therefore hold prognostic and/or potentially predictive value."
https://openalex.org/W2726826717,"Background Iron deficiency is common during infancy and therefore iron supplementation is recommended. Recent reports suggest that iron supplementation in already iron replete infants may adversely affect growth, cognitive development, and morbidity. Methods Normal and growth restricted rat pups were given iron daily (30 or 150 μg/d) from birth to postnatal day (PD) 20, and followed to PD56. At PD20, hematology, tissue iron, and the hepatic metabolome were measured. The plasma metabolome and colonic microbial ecology were assessed at PD20 and PD56. T-maze (PD35) and passive avoidance (PD40) tests were used to evaluate cognitive development. Results Iron supplementation increased iron status in a dose-dependent manner in both groups, but no significant effect of iron on growth was observed. Passive avoidance was significantly lower only in normal rats given high iron compared with controls. In plasma and liver of normal and growth-restricted rats, excess iron increased 3-hydroxybutyrate and decreased several amino acids, urea and myo-inositol. While a profound difference in gut microbiota of normal and growth-restricted rats was observed, with iron supplementation differences in the abundance of strict anaerobes were observed. Conclusion Excess iron adversely affects cognitive development, which may be a consequence of altered metabolism and/or shifts in gut microbiota."

In this study, we investigated litterfall and fine root biomass and production in five deciduous and four coniferous forests at the Gwangneung Experimental Forest in Korea. We used ingrowth cores to measure fine root production and root turnover rate. The litterfall was separated into leaves, twigs, and others, and then leaves were further separated according to species. Annual litterfall mass was not significantly different between the years, 360 to 651 g m-2 in 2011 and 300 to 656 g m-2 in 2012. Annual fine root (<5 mm) production was significantly higher in 2012 (421 to 1342 g m-2) than in 2011 (99 to 872 g m-2). Annual litterfall mass was significantly different among the stands, while fine root production did not statistically differ among the stands. The average fine root turnover rate, calculated by dividing the annual fine root production by the maximum standing fine root biomass, was 1.65 for deciduous forests and 1.97 for coniferous forests. Fine root production constituted 18–44% of NPP, where NPP was the sum of woody biomass production, litterfall production, and fine root production. Belowground production was a greater fraction of NPP in more productive forests suggesting their greater carbon allocation belowground."
https://openalex.org/W2726837775,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many loci associated with body mass index (BMI) in many different populations. Variants in the FTO locus are reported to be one of the strongest genetic predictors of obesity. Recent publications pointed also to a topologically associated domain (TAD) which is identified as a novel region affecting BMI. The TAD area encompasses the IRXB cluster (IRX3, IRX5, IRX6), FTO and RPGRIP1L genes.In this study, we investigated the relationship between variation of the FTO and IRX genes and obesity in Poles. We presented a case-control association analysis (normal versus overweight and/or obesity group) of Polish adult individuals (N = 5418). We determined whether or not the chromosomal region 16:53 500 000-55 500 000 contains polymorphic variants which are correlated with BMI in Polish population, including sex and age stratified analysis.The obtained results showed that the problem of weight-height abnormalities differently affects populations of Polish women and men (χ2 = 187.1; p<0.0001). From 353 SNPs enrolled to this study, 86 were statistically significant (highest χ2 = 15.72; p = 7.35E-05 observed for rs1558902). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed 61 blocks in the tested region of chromosome 16, with 24 SNPs located within the same block (block 8) of approximately 40 kb, in almost complete LD (|D'|>0.98, r2>0.80). We confirmed presence of the genetic susceptibility loci located in intron 1 of the FTO gene, which were correlated with BMI in our study group. For the first time, our analyses revealed strong association of FTO intronic variants (block 8) with overweight in group of men only. We have also identified association of the IRX region with overweight and/or obesity in Polish individuals.Our study demonstrated how tested SNPs make differential contributions to obesity and overweight risk. We revealed sex dependent differences in the distribution of tested loci which are associated with BMI in the population of Poles."
https://openalex.org/W2726024713,"Doxorubicin is a potent chemotherapeutic agent that is widely-used to treat a variety of cancers but causes acute and chronic cardiac injury, severely limiting its use. Clinically, the acute side effects of doxorubicin are mostly manageable, whereas the delayed consequences can lead to life-threatening heart failure, even decades after cancer treatment. The cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin is subject to a critical cumulative and so dosage limitation is considered to be the best way to reduce these effects. Hence, a number of studies have defined a dose of the drug, both in animal models and clinical settings, with the aim of avoiding long-term cardiac effects. Here we show that a generally considered as safe in a mouse model can induce harmful changes in the myocardium, as early as 2 weeks after infusion. The adverse changes include the development of fibrotic lesions, disarray of cardiomyocytes and a major transcription dysregulation. Importantly, low-dose doxorubicin caused specific changes in the transcriptional profile of several histone deacetylases (HDACs) which are epigenetic regulators of cardiac remodelling. This suggests that cardioprotective therapies, aimed at modulating HDACs during doxorubicin treatment, deserve further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2731510513,"Colour discrimination has been widely studied in red-green (R-G) dichromats but the extent to which their colour constancy is affected remains unclear. This work estimated the extent of colour constancy for four normal trichromatic observers and seven R-G dichromats when viewing natural scenes under simulated daylight illuminants. Hyperspectral imaging data from natural scenes were used to generate the stimuli on a calibrated CRT display. In experiment 1, observers viewed a reference scene illuminated by daylight with a correlated colour temperature (CCT) of 6700K; observers then viewed sequentially two versions of the same scene, one illuminated by either a higher or lower CCT (condition 1, pure CCT change with constant luminance) or a higher or lower average luminance (condition 2, pure luminance change with a constant CCT). The observers’ task was to identify the version of the scene that looked different from the reference scene. Thresholds for detecting a pure CCT change or a pure luminance change were estimated, and it was found that those for R-G dichromats were marginally higher than for normal trichromats regarding CCT. In experiment 2, observers viewed sequentially a reference scene and a comparison scene with a CCT change or a luminance change above threshold for each observer. The observers’ task was to identify whether or not the change was an intensity change. No significant differences were found between the responses of normal trichromats and dichromats. These data suggest robust colour constancy mechanisms along daylight locus in R-G dichromacy."
https://openalex.org/W2726016532,"Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disorder with intracellular accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) due to α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) deficiency. Fabry patients frequently report of anxiety, depression, and impaired cognitive function. We characterized affective and cognitive phenotype of male mice with α-Gal A deficiency (Fabry KO) and compared results with those of age-matched male wildtype (WT) littermates. Young (3 months) and old (≥ 18 months) mice were tested in the naïve state and after i.pl. injection of complete Freund`s adjuvant (CFA) as an inflammatory pain model. We used the elevated plus maze (EPM), the light-dark box (LDB) and the open field test (OF) to investigate anxiety-like behavior. The forced swim test (FST) and Morris water maze (MWM) were applied to assess depressive-like and learning behavior. The EPM test revealed no intergroup difference for anxiety-like behavior in naïve young and old Fabry KO mice compared to WT littermates, except for longer time spent in open arms of the EPM for young WT mice compared to young Fabry KO mice (p<0.05). After CFA injection, young Fabry KO mice showed increased anxiety-like behavior compared to young WT littermates (p<0.05) and naïve young Fabry KO mice (p<0.05) in the EPM as reflected by shorter time spent in EPM open arms. There were no relevant differences in the LDB and the OF test, except for longer time spent in the center zone of the OF by young WT mice compared to young Fabry KO mice (p<0.05). Complementary to this, depression-like and learning behavior were not different between genotypes and age-groups, except for the expectedly lower memory performance in older age-groups compared to young mice. Our results indicate that genetic influences on affective and cognitive symptoms in FD may be of subordinate relevance, drawing attention to potential influences of environmental and epigenetic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2732647652,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a devastating disease affecting the skin and internal organs. Dermal fibrosis manifests early and Modified Rodnan Skin Scores (MRSS) correlate with disease progression. Transcriptomics of SSc skin biopsies suggest the role of the in vivo microenvironment in maintaining the pathological myofibroblasts. Therefore, defining the structural changes in dermal collagen in SSc patients could inform our understanding of fibrosis pathogenesis. Here, we report a method for quantitative whole-slide image analysis of dermal collagen from SSc patients, and our findings of more aligned dermal collagen bundles in diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) patients. Using the bleomycin-induced mouse model of SSc, we identified a distinct high dermal collagen bundle alignment gene signature, characterized by a concerted upregulation in cell migration, adhesion, and guidance pathways, and downregulation of spindle, replication, and cytokinesis pathways. Furthermore, increased bundle alignment induced a cell migration gene signature in fibroblasts in vitro, and these cells demonstrated increased directed migration on aligned ECM fibers that is dependent on expression of Arhgdib (Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2). Our results indicate that increased cell migration is a cellular response to the increased collagen bundle alignment featured in fibrotic skin. Moreover, many of the cell migration genes identified in our study are shared with human SSc skin and may be new targets for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2733196519,"Dog Erythrocyte Antigens (DEA) have thus far been found by sensitizing dogs with canine allogeneic blood and are clinically important regarding blood transfusion incompatibilities, but remain poorly defined. The goals of this study were to discover and characterize two DEAs, named as Kai 1 and Kai 2. The monoclonal antibodies were produced by mouse hybridoma techniques and examined by ELISA isotyping, immunoblotting, and affinity chromatography. Canine blood samples were typed and the development of alloantibodies was examined in transfused dogs. The monoclonal Kai 1 and Kai 2 antibodies were isotyped as IgM kappa and IgG3 lamda, respectively, and identified two different erythrocyte membrane proteins of 200 kDa and 80 kDa in molecular weights, respectively. Either Kai 1 or Kai 2 can be expressed but not both in an individual dog. There were no naturally occurring anti-Kai 1 or Kai 2 alloantibodies. In addition, Kai 1- and/or Kai 2- dogs developed Kai 1 and Kai 2 alloantibodies, respectively, when transfused with mismatched blood. This is the first discovery of canine blood types by screening monoclonal antibodies. Kai 1 and Kai 2 are novel blood types which can induce anti-Kai 1 or anti-Kai 2 alloantibodies when Kai 1- and/or Kai 2- dogs are transfused with Kai 1+ or Kai 2+ blood. These canine blood types may explain some of the blood incompatibilities and transfusion reactions observed in dogs in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2728920435,"Background Primary hyperaldosteronism may be associated with elevated 24-hour urinary potassium excretion. We evaluated the diagnostic value of spot urine (SU) potassium as an index of 24-hour urinary potassium excretion. Methods We measured SU and 24-hour urinary collection potassium and creatinine in 382 patients. Correlations between SU and 24-hour collections were assessed for potassium levels and potassium/creatinine ratios. We used the PAHO formula to estimate 24-hour urinary potassium excretion based on SU potassium level. The agreement between estimated and measured 24-hour urinary potassium excretion was evaluated using the Bland-Altman method. To evaluate diagnostic performance of SU potassium, we calculated areas under the curve (AUC) for SU potassium/creatinine ratio and 24-hour urinary potassium excretion estimated using the PAHO formula. Results Strongest correlation between SU and 24-hour collection was found for potassium/creatinine ratio (r = 0.69, P<0.001). The PAHO formula underestimated 24-hour urinary potassium excretion by mean 8.3±18 mmol/d (95% limits of agreement -28 to +44 mmol/d). Diagnostic performance of SU potassium/creatinine ratio was borderline good only if 24-hour urinary potassium excretion was largely elevated (AUC 0.802 for 120 mmol K+/24 h) but poor with lower values (AUC 0.696 for 100 mmol K+/24 h, 0.636 for 80 mmol K+/24 h, 0.675 for 40 mmol K+/24 h). Diagnostic performance of 24-hour urinary potassium excretion estimated by the PAHO formula was excellent with values above 120 mmol/d and good with lower values (AUC 0.941 for 120 mmol K+/24 h, 0.819 for 100 mmol K+/24 h, 0.823 for 80 mmol K+/24 h, 0.836 for 40 mmol K+/24 h). Conclusions Spot urine potassium/creatinine ratio might be a marker of increased 24-hour urinary potassium excretion and a potentially useful screening test when reliable 24-hour urine collection is not available. The PAHO formula allowed estimation of the 24-hour urinary potassium excretion based on SU measurements with reasonable clinical accuracy."

https://openalex.org/W2728310425,"We modeled spine distribution along the dendritic networks of pyramidal neurons in both basal and apical dendrites. To do this, we applied network spatial analysis because spines can only lie on the dendritic shaft. We expanded the existing 2D computational techniques for spatial analysis along networks to perform a 3D network spatial analysis. We analyzed five detailed reconstructions of adult human pyramidal neurons of the temporal cortex with a total of more than 32,000 spines. We confirmed that there is a spatial variation in spine density that is dependent on the distance to the cell body in all dendrites. Considering the dendritic arborizations of each pyramidal cell as a group of instances of the same observation (the neuron), we used replicated point patterns together with network spatial analysis for the first time to search for significant differences in the spine distribution of basal dendrites between different cells and between all the basal and apical dendrites. To do this, we used a recent variant of Ripley's K function defined to work along networks. The results showed that there were no significant differences in spine distribution along basal arbors of the same neuron and along basal arbors of different pyramidal neurons. This suggests that dendritic spine distribution in basal dendritic arbors adheres to common rules. However, we did find significant differences in spine distribution along basal versus apical networks. Therefore, not only do apical and basal dendritic arborizations have distinct morphologies but they also obey different rules of spine distribution. Specifically, the results suggested that spines are more clustered along apical than in basal dendrites. Collectively, the results further highlighted that synaptic input information processing is different between these two dendritic domains."
https://openalex.org/W2729732249,"We conducted a prospective, meaningful study of extreme low dose of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) as a metronomic agent targeting cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to reverse Multidrug resistance (MDR) by sensitizing cancer associated fibroblasts and down-regulating P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The combination of 5FU and Taxol inhibited resistant KB-8-5 tumor growth by 79% and H460/Tax-R tumor growth by 55%. The inhibition was significant for both tumor types compared with Taxol treatment alone (p<0.001 and p = 0.0067, respectively). Nevertheless, the low-dose 5FU (2.2 mg/kg compared to the therapeutic dose of 50–150 mg/kg) showed negligible tumor inhibitory effect. The tumor growth inhibition study on resistant tumors demonstrated that the continuous administration of low dose 5FU with Taxol significantly inhibited the tumor growth. The treatment overcomes drug resistance in tumors by down-regulating multi-drug resistance transporter protein (P-gp), and more importantly, by eliminating CAFs recruited by resistant tumors. Compared with traditional metronomic chemotherapy, 5FU as metronomic agent targeting CAFs can avoid the disadvantages resulted from the concomitant administration of antiangiogenetic drug. The approach has good translational potential for clinical trials when treating stroma-rich drug resistant tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2733618126,"Characterization of the feeding preferences of bivalve larvae would help improving the bivalve aquaculture and hatchery by providing appropriate microalgal diets. However, inaccurate and laborious identification and counting of microalgal species have challenged the selective feeding of bivalves. In the present study, we developed a highly specific and sensitive assay using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to assess the selective feeding of bivalve larvae based on species-specific primers targeting to microalgal 18S rDNA sequences. The assay exhibited good specificity. The detection limits of the qPCR assay were 769, 71, 781 and 21 18S rDNA copies for Chaetoceros calcitrans, Isochrysis galbana, Platymonas helgolandica and Nannochloropsis oculata, respectively. Using such assay, we found that C. calcitrans and I. galbana were preferentially ingested, whereas N. oculata was preferentially rejected in biodeposits of four bivalve species, Tegillarca gransa, Cyclina sinensis, Scapharca subcrenata and Sinonovacula constricta. Furthermore, our growth experiments revealed that C. calcitrans and I. galbana could significantly promote the shell growth, whereas feeding of N. oculata resulted in poorer growth of four bivalve species. These data indicated that qPCR might be useful in screening of efficient and reliable microalgal species for each bivalve species, leading to improved bivalve aquaculture and hatchery."

The current study aimed to compare total and regional bone and soft-tissue composition, in parallel to measurements of blood lipid and inflammatory profiles between adolescent athletes and non-athletes. Anthropometry, biological maturity, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans, training load and lipid and inflammatory profiles were assessed in a cross-sectional sample of 53 male adolescents (20 non-athletes, 15 swimmers and 18 basketball players) aged 12–19 years. Multiple comparisons between groups were performed using analysis of variance, covariance and magnitude effects (ES-r and Cohen’s d). The comparisons of controls with other groups were very large for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (d range: 2.17–2.92). The differences between sports disciplines, regarding tissue outputs obtained from DXA scan were moderate for all variables except fat tissue (d = 0.4). It was possible to determine small differences (ES-r = 0.17) between controls and swimmers for bone area at the lower limbs (13.0%). In parallel, between swimmers and basketball players, the gradient of the differences was small (ES-r range: 0.15–0.23) for bone mineral content (24.6%), bone area (11.3%) and bone mineral density (11.1%) at the lower limbs, favoring the basketball players. These observations highlight that youth male athletes presented better blood and soft tissues profiles with respect to controls. Furthermore, sport-specific differences emerged for the lower limbs, with basketball players presenting higher bone mineral content, area and density than swimmers."

Utilisation and reasons for such use is needed to support the effort to discourage the use of oral SABA in asthma. This study examined the frequency of oral short-acting Beta 2-agonist (SABA) usage in the management of asthma in primary care and determined correlates of its usage.Data used were from the 2014 National Medical Care Survey in Malaysia, a nationally representative survey of primary care encounters (weighted n = 325818). Using methods of analysis of data for complex surveys, we determined the frequency of asthma diagnosis in primary care and the rate of asthma medication prescription, which includes oral SABA. Multivariate logistic regression models were built to assess associations with the prescription of oral SABA.A weighted estimate of 9241 encounters presented to primary care with asthma in 2014. The mean age of the patients was 39.1 years. The rate of oral SABA, oral steroids, inhaled SABA and inhaled corticosteroids prescriptions were 33, 33, 50 and 23 per 100 asthma encounters, respectively. It was most commonly used in patients with the age ranged between 20 to less than 40 years. Logistic regression models showed that there was a higher odds of oral SABA usage in the presence of respiratory infection, prescription of oral corticosteroids and in the private sector.Oral SABA use in asthma is found to be common in a non- resource poor setting and its use could be attributed to a preference for oral medicines along undesirable clinical practices within a fragmented health system."
https://openalex.org/W2732163274,"Ecoimmunology is a burgeoning field of ecology which studies immune responses in wildlife by utilizing general immune assays such as the detection of natural antibody. Unlike adaptive antibodies, natural antibodies are important in innate immune responses and often recognized conserved epitopes present in pathogens. Here, we describe a procedure for measuring natural antibodies reactive to bacterial antigens that may be applicable to a variety of organisms. IgM from desert bighorn sheep plasma samples was tested for reactivity to outer membrane proteins from Vibrio coralliilyticus, a marine bacterium to which sheep would have not been exposed. Immunoblotting demonstrated bighorn sheep IgM could bind to a variety of bacterial cell envelope proteins while ELISA analysis allowed for rapid determination of natural antibody levels in hundreds of individual animals. Natural antibody levels were correlated with the ability of plasma to kill laboratory strains of E. coli bacteria. Finally, we demonstrate that natural antibody levels varied in two distinct populations of desert bighorn sheep. These data demonstrate a novel and specific measure of natural antibody function and show that this varies in ecologically relevant ways."

Each student dissected 10 specimens before training these procedures on human patients, and the benefit of the animal model training was evaluated.Nineteen resident physicians of comparable academic level participated in training. All participants agreed that the lamb's head model dissections improved their skills in using surgical and videoendoscopic instruments, 90% agreed that the dissections improved their confidence with respect to training in human patients, and all stated they would recommend the same training to future residents.Lamb's heads have been used for training in endoscopic sinus surgery. However, no standardization of this training had been performed to ensure that it is a valuable tool for learning and skill-building. The standardized method described in this study increased resident physicians' skills and confidence before beginning their training on human patients.

https://openalex.org/W2726114890,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a diarrheagenic pathogen that afflicts infants in developing countries. The most important virulence trait of EPEC is its ability to intimately adhere to cells in the small intestine, and to elicit diarrhea. The alternative sigma factor RpoS is involved in the virulence of several bacterial species. RpoS coordinates the general stress response and accumulates in cells under stress or in the stationary phase. RpoS levels differ across E. coli strains. High-RpoS strains are highly resistant to environmental stresses, but usually display low nutritional competence, while low-RpoS strains show the opposite phenotype. Here we investigated whether RpoS plays a role in the virulence and fitness of two different EPEC strains, E2348/69 and LRT9. A rpoS null mutation had a small positive effect on LRT9 adherence to epithelial cells, but the expression of the EPEC adhesins BfpA and intimin was not significantly affected by the mutation. E2348/69 adherence was not significantly affected by the rpoS mutation. The intrinsic level of RpoS was higher in LRT9 than in E2348/69 while the latter adhered more strongly and expressed higher levels of the adhesin BfpA than the former. Knockout of rpoS strongly impaired resistance to oxidative, osmotic and acid stress in both E2348/69 and LRT9. However, strain E2348/69 was significantly more sensitive to oxidative stress than LRT9. Finally, competition assays showed that the rpoS mutant of LRT9 displayed higher fitness under continuous culture than its isogenic wild-type strain, while E2348/69 outcompeted its rpoS mutant. In conclusion, RpoS plays mostly a positive role in EPEC biology and at least in the case of strain E2348/69 it is not constrained by the trade-off between vegetative growth and stress resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2724956678,"Background Low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a ubiquitously expressed multi-ligand endocytosis receptor implicated in a wide range of signalling, among others in tumour biology. Tumour-associated genomic mutations of the LRP1 gene are described, but nothing is known about cancer-associated expression of LRP1 splice variants Therefore, the focus of this study was on an annotated truncated LRP1 splice variant (BC072015.1; NCBI GenBank), referred to as smLRP1, which was initially identified in prostate and lung carcinoma. Methods Using PCR and quantitative PCR, the expression of LRP1 and smLRP1 in different human tissues and tumour cell lines was screened and compared on tumour biopsies of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Using a recently developed anti-smLRP1 antibody, the expression of the putative LRP1 protein isoform in tumour cell lines in Western blot and immunofluorescence staining was further investigated. Results The alternative transcript smLRP1 is ubiquitously expressed in 12 human cell lines of different origin and 22 tissues which is similar to LRP1. A shift in expression of smLRP1 relative to LRP1 towards smLRP1 was observed in most tumour cell lines compared to healthy tissue. The expression of LRP1 as well as smLRP1 is decreased in HNSCC cell lines in comparison to healthy mucosa. In vitro results were checked using primary HNSCC. Furthermore, the expression of the protein isoform smLRP1 (32 kDa) was confirmed in human tumour cell lines. Conclusions Similar to LRP1, the truncated splice variant smLRP1 is ubiquitously expressed in healthy human tissues, but altered in tumours pointing to a potential role of smLRP1 in cancer. Comparative results suggest a shift in expression in favour of smLRP1 in tumour cells that warrant further evaluation. The protein isoform is suggested to be secreted."

Methods A total of 165 patients presented with newly diagnosed and untreated DLBCL at the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China, between 2011.01 and 2014.12. Complete clinical information was available for 152 of these 165 patients. We retrospectively reviewed the results of HBV serum marker assays and the clinical information of these 152 DLBCL patients from our hospital database; eventually, only 51 patients were enrolled in this study, and these 51 patients received the PD1 test item. Results ① The incidence of HBsAg prevalence was 13.2% (20/152) in this study; ② The incidence of PD1 expression in the HBsAg+ group was 4.3-fold higher than that in the HBsAg—group (40.0% vs 9.4%; P = 0.010); ③ The clinical information, including sex, age, clinical stage, IPI, molecular subtype and chemotherapy status, was analyzed between the HBsAg+ and HBsAg—groups, but there were no significant differences between the two groups; ④ The median OS and PFS of the patients in the HBsAg+ group were 36.5 months and 12 months, respectively; however, the median OS and PFS of patients in the HBsAg—group were not reached (P = 0.033) and 32 months (P = 0.049), respectively; and ⑤ The median OS and PFS of PD1-positive patients in the HBsAg+ group were the worst (24 months and 9 months, respectively), whereas the median OS and PFS of PD1-negative patients in the HBsAg—group were the best (not reached and 32 months, respectively). Conclusions Compared with patients in the HBsAg—group, the incidence of PD1 expression was significantly higher in the HBsAg+ group, and the median OS and PFS times were the worst in PD1-positive patients in the HBsAg+ group. These results indicated that the dismal prognosis of patients with HBsAg+ may be related to the high rate of PD1 expression. Thus, a targeted PD1 treatment strategy may improve the prognosis of HBsAg+ DLBCL patients."

However, it is difficult to exclude asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms by using conventional, noncontrast head computed tomography (CT), which is the only neuroimaging suggested before r-tPA. Recent case reports and series have shown that administering r-tPA to patients with a pre-existing aneurysm does not increase the bleeding risk. However, Asians are known to have a relatively higher bleeding risk, and little evidence is available regarding the risk of using r-tPA on Asian patients with intracranial aneurysms.Medical records from the Shuang Ho hospital stroke registration between July 2010 and December 2014 were retrospectively reviewed, and 144 patients received r-tPA. Unruptured intracranial aneurysms were detected using CT, or magnetic resonance or conventional angiography after r-tPA. The primary and secondary outcomes were the difference in overall intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and symptomatic ICH after r-tPA. The differences were analyzed using Fisher's exact or Mann-Whitney U tests, and p < 0.05 was defined as the statistical significance.A total of 144 patients were reviewed, and incidental unruptured intracranial aneurysms were found in 11 of them (7.6%). No significant difference was observed in baseline demographic data between the aneurysm and nonaneurysm groups. Among patients with an unruptured aneurysm, two had giant aneurysms (7.7 and 7.4 mm, respectively). The bleeding risk was not significant different between aneurysm group (2 out of 11, 18%) with nonaneurysm group (7 out of 133, 5.3%) (p = 0.14). None of the patients with an unruptured aneurysm had symptomatic ICH, whereas one patient without an aneurysm exhibited symptomatic ICH.The presence of an unruptured intracranial aneurysm did not significantly increase the risk of overall and symptomatic ICH in Taiwanese patients after they received r-tPA."
https://openalex.org/W2727162911,"The nuclear transcription factor estrogen receptor α (ERα) plays a critical role in breast cancer progression. ERα acts as an important growth stimulatory protein in breast cancer and the expression level of ERα is tightly related to the prognosis and treatment of patients. Small leucine zipper protein (sLZIP) functions as a transcriptional cofactor by binding to various nuclear receptors, including glucocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. However, the role of sLZIP in the regulation of ERα and its involvement in breast cancer progression is unknown. We found that sLZIP binds to ERα and represses the transcriptional activity of ERα in ERα-positive breast cancer cells. sLZIP also suppressed the expression of ERα target genes. sLZIP disrupted the binding of ERα to the estrogen response element of the target gene promoter, resulting in suppression of cell proliferation. sLZIP is a novel co-repressor of ERα, and plays a negative role in ERα-mediated cell proliferation in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2727883503,"Mistakes in translation of messenger RNA into protein are clearly a detriment to the recombinant production of pure proteins for biophysical study or the biopharmaceutical market. However, they may also provide insight into mechanistic details of the translation process. Mistakes often involve the substitution of an amino acid having an abundant codon for one having a rare codon, differing by substitution of a G base by an A base, as in the case of substitution of a lysine (AAA) for arginine (AGA). In these cases one expects the substitution frequency to depend on the relative abundances of the respective tRNAs, and thus, one might expect frequencies to be similar for all sites having the same rare codon. Here we demonstrate that, for the ADP-ribosylation factor from yeast expressed in E. coli, lysine for arginine substitutions frequencies are not the same at the 9 sites containing a rare arginine codon; mis-incorporation frequencies instead vary from less than 1 to 16%. We suggest that the context in which the codons occur (clustering of rare sites) may be responsible for the variation. The method employed to determine the frequency of mis-incorporation involves a novel mass spectrometric analysis of the products from the parallel expression of wild type and codon-optimized genes in 15N and 14N enriched media, respectively. The high sensitivity and low material requirements of the method make this a promising technology for the collection of data relevant to other mis-incorporations. The additional data could be of value in refining models for the ribosomal translation elongation process."
https://openalex.org/W2725580120,"C5-substituted 2,4-diaminoquinazolines (2,4-DAQs) ameliorate disease severity in SMA mice. It is uncertain, however, that these compounds increase SMN protein levels in vivo even though they were identified as activators of the SMN2 promoter. These compounds also regulate the expression of other transcripts in neuroblastoma cells. In this study, we investigate the mechanism by which the 2,4-DAQs regulate the expression of SMN2 as well as other targets. D156844, D158872, D157161 and D157495 (RG3039) increased SMN2 promoter-driven reporter gene activity by at least 3-fold in NSC-34 cells. These compounds, however, did not significantly increase SMN2 mRNA levels in type II SMA fibroblasts nor in NSC-34 cells, although there was a trend for these compounds increasing SMN protein in SMA fibroblasts. The number of SMN-containing gems was increased in SMA fibroblasts in response to 2,4-DAQ treatment in a dose-dependent manner. ATOH7 mRNA levels were significantly lower in type II SMA fibroblasts. 2,4-DAQs significantly increased ATOH7, DRNT1 and DRTN2 transcript levels in type II SMA fibroblasts and restored ATOH7 levels to those observed in healthy fibroblasts. These compounds also increase Atoh7 mRNA expression in NSC-34 cells. In conclusion, 2,4-DAQs regulate SMN2 by increasing protein levels and gem localization. They also increase ATOH7, DRNT1 and DRNT2 transcript levels. This study reveals that the protective effects of 2,4-DAQs in SMA may be independent of SMN2 gene regulation. These compounds could be used in concert with a proven SMN2 inducer to develop a multi-faceted approach to treating SMA."

However, adding even more pulses usually comes at a price—that of very long experimental times to collect all of the data. Spencer et al. ( 1 ) now report on a six-pulse laser spectroscopy that obtains intricate details on the coupling between electronic states to vibrational motions, a key issue in the observation of quantum coherence in proteins ( 2 – 5 ). This method takes advantage of the ingenious gradient-assisted photon-echo spectroscopy (GRAPES) developed ( 6 ) for four-pulse spectroscopy that speeds acquisition times by tilting the beams to introduce time delays and sampling along a line rather than a point."

Police investigations rarely solve such crimes, so many families are left to search on their own for the hidden graves that may hold their relatives. Last week, a team of data scientists and human rights researchers released a new tool for the searchers: a map predicting which municipalities in Mexico are most likely to house hidden graves. In addition to 43 municipalities with hidden graves publicly reported in 2016—mostly in the states of Veracruz and Guerrero—the model identified 45 other municipalities as having a 70% or higher chance of containing unreported graves. Topping that list is Coyuca de Benitez in Guerrero, with an 86% chance. Five of the 10 with the highest probabilities—including Nogales, Sonora; and Juarez, Chihuahua—are in states along the U.S. border. Places least likely to contain hidden graves include the southern states of Quintana Roo and Yucatan."
https://openalex.org/W2734039304,"The silvery vacuum chamber resembles a zeppelin, the vaguely Art Deco lines of
 the welds between its stainless steel panels looking at once futuristic and
 old-fashioned. Although earthbound, the blimp-sized chamber at the Karlsruhe
 Institute of Technology in Germany has an ethereal purpose: weighing the most
 elusive and mysterious of subatomic particles, the neutrino. Physicists dreamed
 up the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment in 2001. Now, the pieces
 of the €60 million project are finally coming together, and the roughly
 140 members of the KATRIN team plan to start taking data early next year. It
 might seem absurd that physicists don9t know how much neutrinos weigh, given
 that the universe contains more of them than any other type of matter particle.
 However, it9s impossible to capture neutrinos, so there9s no simple way to
 measure their mass. Instead, for 70 years, physicists have tried to infer the
 neutrino9s mass by studying a particular nuclear decay from which the particle
 emerges—the beta decay of tritium. Time and again, these experiments have
 set only upper limits on the neutrino9s mass. In KATRIN, physicists are pushing
 that classic experiment to its ultimate limits, in what may be their last, best
 hope to weigh the neutrino."
