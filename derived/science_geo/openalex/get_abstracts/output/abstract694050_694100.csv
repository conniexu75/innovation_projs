https://openalex.org/W4281381287,"Understanding the nanoscopic chemical and structural changes that drive instabilities in emerging energy materials is essential for mitigating device degradation. The power conversion efficiency of halide perovskite photovoltaic devices has reached 25.7 per cent in single-junction and 29.8 per cent in tandem perovskite/silicon cells1,2, yet retaining such performance under continuous operation has remained elusive3. Here we develop a multimodal microscopy toolkit to reveal that in leading formamidinium-rich perovskite absorbers, nanoscale phase impurities, including hexagonal polytype and lead iodide inclusions, are not only traps for photoexcited carriers, which themselves reduce performance4,5, but also, through the same trapping process, are sites at which photochemical degradation of the absorber layer is seeded. We visualize illumination-induced structural changes at phase impurities associated with trap clusters, revealing that even trace amounts of these phases, otherwise undetected with bulk measurements, compromise device longevity. The type and distribution of these unwanted phase inclusions depends on the film composition and processing, with the presence of polytypes being most detrimental for film photo-stability. Importantly, we reveal that both performance losses and intrinsic degradation processes can be mitigated by modulating these defective phase impurities, and demonstrate that this requires careful tuning of local structural and chemical properties. This multimodal workflow to correlate the nanoscopic landscape of beam-sensitive energy materials will be applicable to a wide range of semiconductors for which a local picture of performance and operational stability has yet to be established."
https://openalex.org/W4285741252,"Monetary and legal incentives have been proposed to promote COVID-19 vaccination uptake. To evaluate the suitability of incentives, an experiment with German participants examined the effects of payments (varied within subjects: 0 to 10,000 EUR) and freedoms (varied between subjects: vaccination leading vs. not leading to the same benefits as a negative test result) on the vaccination intentions of previously unvaccinated individuals ( n = 782) in April 2021. While no effect could be found for freedoms, the share of participants willing to be vaccinated increased with the payment amount. However, a significant change required large rewards of 3,250 EUR or more. While monetary incentives could increase vaccination uptake by a few percentage points, the high costs of implementation challenge the efficiency of the measure and call for alternatives. As the data suggest that considering vaccination as safe, necessary, and prosocial increases an individual’s likelihood of wanting to get vaccinated without payment, interventions should focus on these features when promoting vaccination against COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4281482989,"As the reach of science content in traditional media declines, many institutions and scientists are turning to YouTube as a powerful tool for communicating directly with non-expert publics. They do so with little empirical social science research guiding their efforts. This study explores how video characteristics and social endorsement cues provided by audience members might influence user engagement with online science videos. Shorter videos are more likely to be viewed. Social endorsement cues significantly relate to variations in user engagement, with likes having a consistent positive association with all types of engagement. Implications for science communication through YouTube are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4281493687,"Background We aimed to study whether social patterns of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection changed in France throughout the year 2020, in light to the easing of social contact restrictions. Methods A population-based cohort of individuals aged 15 years or over was randomly selected from the national tax register to collect socio-economic data, migration history, and living conditions in May and November 2020. Home self-sampling on dried blood was proposed to a 10% random subsample in May and to all in November. A positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG result against the virus spike protein (ELISA-S) was the primary outcome. The design, including sampling and post-stratification weights, was taken into account in univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Of the 134,391 participants in May, 107,759 completed the second questionnaire in November, and respectively 12,114 and 63,524 were tested. The national ELISA-S seroprevalence was 4.5% [95%CI: 4.0%-5.1%] in May and 6.2% [5.9%-6.6%] in November. It increased markedly in 18-24-year-old population from 4.8% to 10.0%, and among second-generation immigrants from outside Europe from 5.9% to 14.4%. This group remained strongly associated with seropositivity in November, after controlling for any contextual or individual variables, with an adjusted OR of 2.1 [1.7–2.7], compared to the majority population. In both periods, seroprevalence remained higher in healthcare professions than in other occupations. Conclusion The risk of Covid-19 infection increased among young people and second-generation migrants between the first and second epidemic waves, in a context of less strict social restrictions, which seems to have reinforced territorialized socialization among peers."
https://openalex.org/W4285739889,"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread infections have allowed SARS-CoV-2 to evolve in human, leading to the emergence of multiple circulating variants. Some of these variants show increased resistance to vaccine-elicited immunity, convalescent plasma, or monoclonal antibodies. In particular, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike have drawn attention. To facilitate the isolation of neutralizing antibodies and the monitoring of vaccine effectiveness against these variants, we designed and produced biotin-labeled molecular probes of variant SARS-CoV-2 spikes and their subdomains, using a structure-based construct design that incorporated an N-terminal purification tag, a specific amino acid sequence for protease cleavage, the variant spike-based region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. These probes could be produced by a single step using in-process biotinylation and purification. We characterized the physical properties and antigenicity of these probes, comprising the N-terminal domain (NTD), the receptor-binding domain (RBD), the RBD and subdomain 1 (RBD-SD1), and the prefusion-stabilized spike ectodomain (S2P) with sequences from SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern or of interest, including variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, Delta, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron. We functionally validated probes by using yeast expressing a panel of nine SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding antibodies and confirmed sorting capabilities of variant probes using yeast displaying libraries of plasma antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent donors. We deposited these constructs to Addgene to enable their dissemination. Overall, this study describes a matrix of SARS-CoV-2 variant molecular probes that allow for assessment of immune responses, identification of serum antibody specificity, and isolation and characterization of neutralizing antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W4281389525,"The impact of spontaneous movements on neuronal activity has created the need to quantify behavior. We present a versatile framework to directly capture the 3D motion of freely definable body points in a marker-free manner with high precision and reliability. Combining the tracking with neural recordings revealed multiplexing of information in the motor cortex neurons of freely moving rats. By integrating multiple behavioral variables into a model of the neural response, we derived a virtual head fixation for which the influence of specific body movements was removed. This strategy enabled us to analyze the behavior of interest (e.g., front paw movements). Thus, we unveiled an unexpectedly large fraction of neurons in the motor cortex with tuning to the paw movements, which was previously masked by body posture tuning. Once established, our framework can be efficiently applied to large datasets while minimizing the experimental workload caused by animal training and manual labeling."
https://openalex.org/W4281479590,"Breastfeeding duration is associated with improved cognitive development in children, but it is unclear whether this is a causal relationship or due to confounding. This study evaluates whether the observed association is explained by socioeconomic position (SEP) and maternal cognitive ability.Data from 7,855 singletons born in 2000-2002 and followed up to age 14 years within the UK Millennium Cohort Study were analysed. Mothers reported breastfeeding duration, and children's cognitive abilities were assessed at 5, 7, 11, and 14 years using validated measures. Standardised verbal (age 5 to 14) and spatial (age 5 to 11) cognitive scores were compared across breastfeeding duration groups using multivariable linear mixed-effects models (repeated outcome measures).At all ages, longer breastfeeding durations were associated with higher cognitive scores after accounting for the child's own characteristics. Adjustment for SEP approximately halved the effect sizes. Further adjustment for maternal cognitive scores removed the remaining associations at age 5, but not at ages 7, 11 and 14 (e.g.: verbal scores, age 14; breastfed ≥12 months vs never breastfed: 0.26 SD; 95%CI: 0.18, 0.34).The associations between breastfeeding duration and cognitive scores persist after adjusting for SEP and maternal cognitive ability, however the effect was modest."
https://openalex.org/W4281482998,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an invariably lethal progressive disease, causing degeneration of neurons and muscle. No current treatment halts or reverses disease advance. This single arm, open label, clinical trial in patients with ALS investigated the safety and tolerability of a novel modified low molecular weight dextran sulphate (LMW-DS, named ILB®) previously proven safe for use in healthy volunteers and shown to exert potent neurotrophic effects in pre-clinical studies. Secondary endpoints relate to efficacy and exploratory biomarkers.Thirteen patients with ALS were treated with 5 weekly subcutaneous injections of ILB®. Safety and efficacy outcome measures were recorded weekly during treatment and at regular intervals for a further 70 days. Functional and laboratory biomarkers were assessed before, during and after treatment.No deaths, serious adverse events or participant withdrawals occurred during or after ILB® treatment and no significant drug-related changes in blood safety markers were evident, demonstrating safety and tolerability of the drug in this cohort of patients with ALS. The PK of ILB® in patients with ALS was similar to that seen in healthy controls. The ILB® injection elicited a transient elevation of plasma Hepatocyte Growth Factor, a neurotrophic and myogenic growth factor. Following the ILB® injections patients reported increased vitality, decreased spasticity and increased mobility. The ALSFRS-R rating improved from 36.31 ± 6.66 to 38.77 ± 6.44 and the Norris rating also improved from 70.61 ± 13.91 to 77.85 ± 14.24 by Day 36. The improvement of functions was associated with a decrease in muscle atrophy biomarkers. These therapeutic benefits decreased 3-4 weeks after the last dosage.This pilot clinical study demonstrates safety and tolerability of ILB® in patients with ALS. The exploratory biomarker and functional measures must be cautiously interpreted but suggest clinical benefit and have a bearing on the mechanism of action of ILB®. The results support the drug's potential as the first disease modifying treatment for patients with ALS.EudraCT 2017-005065-47."
https://openalex.org/W4281389666,"Changes to the healthcare system due to COVID-19 have altered care delivery during birth and the postpartum period, a transitional time that requires intensive healthcare support and that is complicated by well-established health disparities. Our objective was to identify additional challenges to healthcare interactions that emerged for low-income postpartum individuals during the pandemic.This is a qualitative investigation of low-income postpartum individuals enrolled in a trial of postpartum care, who gave birth in the United States in the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed in-depth semi-structured interviews that addressed healthcare experiences during and after birth, both for in-person and telemedicine encounters. Transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparative method.Of 46 eligible individuals, 87% (N = 40) completed an interview, with 50% identifying as non-Hispanic Black and 38% as Hispanic. Challenges were organized into three domains: unanticipated changes in the birth experience, delayed care, and perceived disadvantages of telemedicine. Changes in the birth experience addressed uncertainty about COVID-19 status, COVID-19 testing, separation from newborn, and visitor restrictions. Delayed care themes addressed logistical challenges, postpartum care, health maintenance, and pediatric care. Participants reported multiple telemedicine-related challenges, including difficulty establishing rapport with providers.Understanding the challenges experienced by low-income peripartum individuals as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves is critical to informing guidelines and diminishing inequities in healthcare delivery. Potential solutions that may mitigate limitations to care in the pandemic include emphasizing shared decision-making in care processes and developing communication strategies to improve telemedicine rapport."
https://openalex.org/W4281483266,"We undertook a prospective temporal study collecting blood samples from consenting pregnant women, to test the hypothesis that circulating extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) carrying specific non-coding microRNA signatures can underlie gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). To test this hypothesis, miRNA cargo of isolated and characterized EVs revealed contributions from the placenta and differential expression at all three trimesters and at delivery between pregnant and non-pregnant states. Many miRNAs originate from the placental-specific chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (19MC) and chromosome 14 microRNA cluster (14MC). Further a positive correlation emerged between third trimester and at delivery EVs containing miRNAs and those expressed by the corresponding post-parturient placentas ( R value = 0.63 to 0.69, p value = 2.2X10 -16 ), in normal and GDM. In addition, distinct differences at all trimesters emerged between women who subsequently developed GDM. Analysis by logistic regression with leave-one-out-cross validation revealed the optimal combination of miRNAs using all the circulating miRNAs ( miR-92a-3p , miR-192-5p , miR-451a , miR-122-5p ), or using only the differentially expressed miRNAs (has-miR-92a-3p, hsa-miR-92b-3p, hsa-miR-100-5p and hsa-miR-125a-3p) in GDM during the first trimester. As an initial step, both sets of miRNAs demonstrated a predictive probability with an area under the curve of 0.95 to 0.96. These miRNAs targeted genes involved in cell metabolism, proliferation and immune tolerance. In particular genes of the P-I-3-Kinase , FOXO , insulin signaling and glucogenic pathways were targeted, suggestive of placental connectivity with various maternal organs/cells, altering physiology along with pathogenic mechanisms underlying the subsequent development of GDM. We conclude that circulating EVs originating from the placenta with their miRNA cargo communicate and regulate signaling pathways in maternal organs, thereby predetermining development of GDM."
https://openalex.org/W4281387817,"We sought association between serum Lipoprotein(a) and C-Peptide levels as two predictors with cardiometabolic biomarkers in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This nested case-control study was conducted on 253 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus and control from the second phase of the KERCADR cohort study. The participants were randomly allocated into case and control groups. The quantitative levels of Lipoprotein(a) and C-Peptide were measured by ELISA. Atherogenic indices of plasma were measured. The plasma Atherogenic Index of Plasma significantly decreased (P = 0.002) in case-male participants, and plasma Castelli Risk Index II level significantly increased (P = 0.008) in control-male participants with the highest dichotomy of Lipoprotein(a). The plasma Atherogenic Index of Plasma level in case-female participants significantly increased (P = 0.023) with the highest dichotomy of C-Peptide. Serum C-Peptide level significantly increased (P = 0.010 and P = 0.002, respectively) in control-male participants with the highest dichotomies of Atherogenic Index of Plasma and Castelli Risk Index I. There was a significant association between the highest quartile of C-Peptide and higher anthropometric values in case participants; and higher atherogenic indices of plasma and anthropometric values in control participants. Raised serum C-peptide than raised Lipoprotein(a) can be a prior predictor for cardiometabolic disease risk in healthy participants and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with increased cardiometabolic biomarkers. Case and control males with general and visceral obesity and case and control females with visceral obesity are exposure to increased C-peptide, respectively. Lipoprotein(a) may be risk independent biomarker for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Reducing raised Lipoprotein(a) levels to less than 30ng/ml with strict control of low density lipoprotein cholesterol would be the best approach to prevent coronary artery disease consequences. It is suggested that a screening system be set up to measure the Lp(a) levels in the community for seemingly healthy people or individuals with one or more cardiometabolic biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W4281396354,"Hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the leading preventable causes of in-hospital mortality. However, its risk assessment in medically ill inpatients is complicated due to the patients' heterogeneity and complexity of currently available risk assessment models (RAMs). The simplified Geneva score provides simplicity but has not yet been prospectively validated. Immobility is an important predictor for VTE in RAMs, but its definition is inconsistent and based on subjective assessment by nurses or physicians. In this study, we aim to prospectively validate the simplified Geneva score and to examine the predictive performance of a novel and objective definition of in-hospital immobilization using accelerometry.RISE is a multicenter prospective cohort study. The goal is to recruit 1350 adult inpatients admitted for medical illness in three Swiss tertiary care hospitals. We collect data on demographics, comorbidities, VTE risk and thromboprophylaxis. Mobility from admission to discharge is objectively measured using a wrist-worn accelerometer. Participants are followed for 90 days for the occurrence of symptomatic VTE (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes are the occurrence of clinically relevant bleeding, and mortality. The evolution of autonomy in the activities of daily living, the length of stay, and the occurrence of readmission are also recorded. Time-dependent area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values are calculated for each RAM (i.e. the simplified and original Geneva score, Padua, and IMPROVE score) with and without the objective mobility measures to assess their accuracy in predicting hospital-acquired VTE at 90 days.The ethics committee approved the protocol and the study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT04439383. RISE has the potential to optimize VTE risk stratification, and thus to improve the quality of care of medically hospitalized patients."
https://openalex.org/W4281564327,"Psychological stress is associated with various oral diseases such as aphthous stomatitis, oral lichen planus, taste disturbances and glossodynia. However, the underlying mechanism is still unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of psychological stress on salivary proteins and the oral microbiota in a rat model of chronic restraint stress. Six-week-old Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to restraint stress for four hours daily for 1 month. The behavior, weights of the adrenal glands, and serum corticosterone levels were evaluated as stress markers. Proteomic analysis of the saliva was performed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry and Western blotting. Analysis of the oral microbiota was performed via 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing. The low mean body weights, lower number of entries and time spent in the open arm of elevated plus maze, high adrenal gland/body weight ratios, and high serum corticosterone levels confirmed the high levels of stress in the stress group of rats compared to the controls. Thirty-three protein spots were found to be significantly altered between the two groups. After silver staining, seven visible spots were subjected for mass spectrometry, and the expression levels of the two most significantly altered proteins, BPI fold containing family A member 2 and von Ebner’s gland protein, were confirmed by Western blotting. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed a significant reduction in alpha diversity in the stress group compared to the controls. The abundances of oral bacteria, such as Facklamia and Corynebacterium , were significantly altered between the two groups. Additionally, analysis with PICRUSt2 software predicted 37 different functional pathways to be altered between the groups. In conclusion, the present study identified altered salivary proteins and oral microbiota due to psychological stress. These findings might aid in understanding the pathogenesis of stress-related oral diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4281569896,"The western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, is an economically important pest of field corn (Zea mays L.) across the United States (U.S.) Corn Belt. Repeated use of transgenic hybrids expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) proteins has selected for field-evolved resistance to all current rootworm-active Bt proteins. The newest product available for WCR management is SmartStax® PRO, a rootworm-active pyramid containing Cry3Bb1, Cry34/35Ab1 [now reclassified as Gpp34Ab1/Tpp35Ab1] and a new mode of action, DvSnf7 dsRNA. Understanding the fitness of adult WCR after dietary exposure to SmartStax® PRO will identify potential impacts on WCR population dynamics and inform efforts to optimize resistance management strategies. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to characterize the effect of SmartStax® PRO dietary exposure on WCR life history traits. Adult WCR were collected during 2018 and 2019 from emergence tents placed over replicated field plots of SmartStax® PRO or non-rootworm Bt corn at a site with a history of rootworm-Bt trait use and suspected resistance to Cry3Bb1 and Cry34/35Ab1. Adult survival was reduced by 97.1-99.7% in SmartStax® PRO plots relative to the non-rootworm Bt corn plots during the study. Individual male/female pairs were fed different diets of ear tissue to simulate lifetime or adult exposure. Life history parameters measured included adult longevity, adult head capsule width, lifetime female egg production, and egg viability. Results indicate that lifetime or adult exposure to SmartStax® PRO significantly reduced adult longevity and lifetime egg production. Larval exposure to SmartStax® PRO significantly reduced WCR adult size. Results from this study collectively suggest that SmartStax® PRO may negatively impact WCR life history traits, which may lead to reduced population growth when deployed in an area with WCR resistance to Bt traits."
https://openalex.org/W4285741588,"The development of robust nutrient management strategies have played a crucial role in improving crop productivity, profitability and nutrient use efficiency. Therefore, the implementation of efficient nutrient management stratigies is important for food security and environmental safety. Amongst the essential plant nutrients, managing nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) based production systems is citically important to maximize profitable production with minimal negative environmental impacts. We investigated the effects of different fertilizer-N (viz. 0-240 kg N ha-1; N0-N240) and fertilizer-K (viz. 0-90 kg K ha-1; K0-K90) application rates on wheat productivity, nutrient (N and K) use efficiency viz. partial factor productivity (PFPN/K), agronomic efficiency (AEN/K), physiological efficiency (PEN/K), reciprocal internal use efficiency (RIUEN/K), and profitability in terms of benefit-cost (B-C) ratio, gross returns above fertilizer cost (GRAFC) and the returns on investment (ROI) on fertilizer application. These results revealed that wheat productivity, plant growth and yield attributes, nutrients uptake and use efficiency increased significantly (p<0.05)with fertilizer-N application, although the interaction effect of N x K application was statistically non-significant (p<0.05). Fertilizer-N application at 120 kg N ha-1 (N120) increased the number of effective tillers (8.7%), grain yield (17.3%), straw yield (15.1%), total N uptake (25.1%) and total K uptake (16.1%) than the N80. Fertilizer-N application significantly increased the SPAD reading by ~4.2-10.6% with fertilizer-N application (N80-N240), compared with N0. The PFPN and PFPK increased significantly with fertilizer-N and K application in wheat. The AEN varied between 12.3 and 22.2 kg kg-1 with significantly higher value of 20.8 kg kg-1 in N120. Fertilizer-N application at higher rate (N160) significantly decreased the AEN by ~16.3% over N120. The N120treatment increased the AEK by ~52.6% than N80 treatment. Similarly the RIUEN varied between 10.6 and 25.6 kg Mg-1 grain yield, and increased significantly by ~80.2% with N120 as compared to N0 treatment. The RIUEK varied between 109 and 15.1 kg Mg-1 grain yield, and was significantly higher in N120 treatment. The significant increase in mean gross returns (MGRs) by ~17.3% and mean net returns (MNRs) by ~24.1% increased the B-C ratio by ~15.1% with N120 than the N80 treatment. Fertilizer-N application in N120 treatment increased the economic efficiency of wheat by ~24.1% and GRAFC by ~16.9%. Grain yield was significantly correlated with total N uptake (r = 0.932**, p<0.01), K uptake (r = 0.851**), SPAD value (r = 0.945**), green seeker reading (r = 0.956**), and the RIUEN (r = 0.910**). The artificial neural networks (ANNs) showed highly satisfactory performance in training and simulation of testing data-set on wheat grain yield. The calculated mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) for wheat were 0.0087, 0.834 and 0.052, respectively. The well trained ANNs model was capable of producing consistency for the training and testing correlation (R2 = 0.994**, p<0.01) between the predicted and actual values of wheat grain yield, which implies that ANN model succeeded in wheat grain yield prediction."
https://openalex.org/W4285741665,"To determine the time to resolution of tubal ectopic pregnancy after methotrexate treatment.A 14-year retrospective cohort study was performed from 2004-2018 and assessed 216 women treated with single-dose methotrexate for tubal ectopic pregnancy. Women were treated using a single-dose protocol of intramuscular methotrexate (50mg/m2) for confirmed tubal ectopic pregnancy on ultrasound. Ectopic pregnancies were included if the ectopic pregnancy mass was <35mm, no evidence of rupture and no embryonic cardiac activity. Serum hCG was measured on day 1, 4 and 7 of treatment and then at standard weekly intervals until resolution. Where there was not a ≥15% decline in hCG from day 4 and day 7, a second dose of methotrexate was administered. The primary outcome was time to resolution (days), with serum hCG <5 IU/L considered resolved. The secondary outcome was need for rescue surgery.Among women who did not proceed to surgery, the median time to resolution was 22 days (IQR 14,34). Time to resolution and need for rescue surgery increased with baseline hCG. When hCG was <1000 IU/L, the median was 20 days (IQR 13,29) but 34.5 days (IQR 22,48) with hCG >2000 IU/L. Early hCG trends were predictive of time to resolution and likelihood of rescue surgery; a hCG rise of >1000 IU/L between Days 1-4 increased time to resolution to 61 days (IQR 35,80) and an odds ratio of rescue surgery of 28.6 (95% C.I. 5.3,155.4).The median time to resolution for ectopic pregnancies treated with methotrexate is 22 days and associated with baseline hCG levels. The predictive value of baseline hCG may be useful in clinical decision making and counselling women considering methotrexate for ectopic pregnancy."

https://openalex.org/W4281385260,"Background Economically underdeveloped areas in western China are hotspots of tuberculosis, especially among students. However, the related spatial and temporal patterns and influencing factors are still unclear and there are few studies to analyze the causes of pulmonary tuberculosis in students from the perspective of space. Methods We collected data regarding the reported incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) among students at township level in Nanning, from 2012 to 2018. The reported incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis among students in Nanning was analyzed using spatial autocorrelation and spatial scan statistical analysis to depict hotspots of PTB incidence and spatial and temporal clustering. Spatial panel data of the reported incidence rates and influencing factors at district and county levels in Nanning were collected from 2015 to 2018. Then, we analyzed the spatial effects of incidence and influencing factors using the spatial Durbin model to explore the mechanism of each influencing factor in areas with high disease prevalence under spatial effects. Results From 2012 to 2018, 1609 cases of PTB were reported among students in Nanning, with an average annual reported incidence rate of 14.84/100,000. Through the Joinpoint regression model, We observed a steady trend in the percentage of cases reported each year (P&gt;0.05). There was spatial autocorrelation between the annual reported incidence and the seven-years average reported incidence from 2012 to 2018. The high-incidence area was distributed in the junction of six urban areas and spread to the periphery, with the junction at the center. The population of college students, per capita financial expenditure on health, per capita gross domestic product, and the number of health technicians per 1,000 population were all influencing factors in the reported incidence of PTB among students. Conclusion We identified spatial clustering of the reported incidence of PTB among students in Nanning, mainly located in the urban center and its surrounding areas. The clustering gradually decreased from the urban center to the surrounding areas. Spatial effects influenced the reported incidence of PTB. The population density of college students, per capita health financial expenditure, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and the number of health technicians per 1,000 were all influencing factors in the reported incidence of PTB among students."
https://openalex.org/W4281397798,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S . Typhimurium) is a highly adaptive pathogenic bacteria with a serious public health concern due to its increasing resistance to antibiotics. Therefore, identification of novel drug targets for S . Typhimurium is crucial. Here, we first created a pathogen-host integrated genome-scale metabolic network by combining the metabolic models of human and S . Typhimurium, which we further tailored to the pathogenic state by the integration of dual transcriptome data. The integrated metabolic model enabled simultaneous investigation of metabolic alterations in human cells and S . Typhimurium during infection. Then, we used the tailored pathogen-host integrated genome-scale metabolic network to predict essential genes in the pathogen, which are candidate novel drug targets to inhibit infection. Drug target prioritization procedure was applied to these targets, and pabB was chosen as a putative drug target. It has an essential role in 4-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) synthesis, which is an essential biomolecule for many pathogens. A structure based virtual screening was applied through docking simulations to predict candidate compounds that eliminate S . Typhimurium infection by inhibiting pabB. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study for predicting drug targets and drug like molecules by using pathogen-host integrated genome-scale models, dual RNA-seq data and structure-based virtual screening protocols. This framework will be useful in proposing novel drug targets and drugs for antibiotic-resistant pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W4281400599,"California tuberculosis (TB) prevention goals include testing more than ten million at-risk Californians and treating two million infected with tuberculosis. Adequate health insurance and robust healthcare utilization are crucial to meeting these goals, but information on these factors for populations that experience risk for TB is limited.We used data from the 2014-2017 California Health Interview Survey (n = 82,758), a population-based dual-frame telephone survey to calculate survey proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CI) stratified by country of birth, focusing on persons from countries of birth with the highest number of TB cases in California. Survey proportions for recent doctor's visit, overall health, smoking, and diabetes were age-adjusted.Among 18-64 year-olds, 27% (CI: 25-30) of persons born in Mexico reported being uninsured in contrast with 3% (CI: 1-5) of persons born in India. Report of recent doctor's visit was highest among persons born in the Philippines, 84% (CI: 80-89) and lowest among Chinese-born persons, 70% (CI: 63-76). Persons born in Mexico were more likely to report community clinics as their usual source of care than persons born in China, Vietnam, or the Philippines. Poverty was highest among Mexican-born persons, 56% (CI: 54-58) and lowest among Indian-born persons, 9% (CI: 5-13). Of adults with a medical visit in a non-English language, 96% (CI: 96-97) were non-U.S.-born, but only 42% (CI: 40-44) of non-U.S.-born persons had a visit in a non-English language.Many, though not all, of the populations that experience risk for TB had health insurance and used healthcare. We found key differences in usual source of care and language use by country of birth which should be considered when planning outreach to specific providers, clinic systems, insurers and communities for TB prevention and case-finding."

Self-determined motivation for solitude reflects wanting time alone to find enjoyment and gain meaningful benefits from it, whereas preference for solitude concerns wanting time for oneself over others’ company regardless of reasons for why time alone is wanted. We investigated two personality characteristics: introversion from Big-Five personality theory and dispositional autonomy from self-determination theory. In two diary studies university students completed personality measures and reported about their experiences with time spent alone over a period of seven days. Across both studies, contrary to popular belief that introverts spend time alone because they enjoy it, results showed no evidence that introversion is predictive of either preference or motivation for solitude. Dispositional autonomy–the tendency to regulate from a place of self-congruence, interest, and lack of pressure–consistently predicted self-determined motivation for solitude but was unrelated to preference for solitude. These findings provided evidence supporting the link between valuing time spent alone with individual differences in the capacity to self-regulate in choiceful and authentic way."
https://openalex.org/W4285740343,"Around the world, governments make substantial investments in public sector research and development (R&D) entities and activities to generate major scientific and technical advances that may catalyze long-term economic growth. Institutions ranging from the Chinese Academy of Sciences to the French National Centre for Scientific Research to the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers conduct basic and applied R&D to create commercially valuable knowledge that supports the innovation goals of their respective government sponsors. Globally, the single largest public sector R&D sponsor is the U.S. federal government. In 2019 alone, the U.S. government allocated over $14.9 billion to federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), also known as national labs. However, little is known about how federal agencies' utilization of FFRDCs, their modes of R&D collaboration, and their adoption of non-patent intellectual property (IP) policies (copyright protection and materials transfer agreements) affect agency-level performance in technology transfer. In particular, the lack of standardized metrics for quantitatively evaluating government entities' effectiveness in managing innovation is a critical unresolved issue. We address this issue by conducting exploratory empirical analyses of federal agencies' innovation management activities using both supply-side (filing ratio, transfer rate, and licensing success rate) and demand-side (licensing income and portfolio exclusivity) outcome metrics. We find economically significant effects of external R&D collaborations and non-patent IP policies on the technology transfer performance of 10 major federal executive branch agencies (fiscal years 1999-2016). We discuss the scholarly, managerial, and policy implications for ongoing and future evaluations of technology transfer at federal labs. We offer new insights and guidance on how critical differences in federal agencies' interpretation and implementation of their R&D management practices in pursuit of their respective missions affect their technology transfer performance outcomes. We generalize key findings to address the broader innovation processes of public sector R&D entities worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W4281399713,"Individuals experiencing homelessness are known to have increased rates of healthcare utilization when compared to the average patient population, often attributed to their complex health care needs and under or untreated comorbid conditions. With increasing focus on hospital readmissions among acute care settings, a better understanding of these comorbidity patterns and their impacts on acute care utilization could help improve quality of care. This study aims to identify distinct comorbidity profiles of homeless patients, and to explore the correlates of the identified comorbidity profiles and their impact on hospital readmission. This is a retrospective analysis using electronic health records (EHR) of patients experiencing homelessness encountered in the hospitals of ChristianaCare from 2015 to 2019 (N = 3445). Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify the comorbidity profiles of homeless patients. The mean age of the study population was 44-year, and the majority were male (63%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were tobacco use (77%), followed by depression (58%), drug use disorder (56%), anxiety disorder (50%), hypertension (44%), and alcohol use disorder (43%). The LCA model identified 4 comorbidity classes—“relatively healthy” class with 31% of the patients, “medically-comorbid with SUD” class with 15% of the patients, “substance use disorder (SUD)” class with 39%, and “Medically comorbid” class with 15% of the patients. The Kaplan-Meir curves of probability of readmission against time from the index visits were significantly different for the four classes (p&lt;0.001). The multivariable Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and insurance type showed that the hazard for readmission among patients in medically comorbid with SUD class is 3.16 (CI: 2.72, 3.67) times higher than the patients in the relatively healthy class."
https://openalex.org/W4281493506,"Introduction Suicide by firearm is a major public health problem in many countries. But, studies that investigated the mortality of suicide by firearm on a global scale are still limited. The aim of this study was to assess the global, regional and national trends in mortality of suicide by firearm from 1990 to 2019. Method Mortality data of suicide by firearm was presented using the age-standardized rates (ASRs, expressed per 100,000). Joinpoint regression analysis was used to assess trends of mortality of suicide by firearm: the average annual percent change (AAPC) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was calculated. Results A total of 52,694 (45,110 male and 7584 female) deaths of suicide by firearm were reported worldwide in 2019. The global ASR of suicide by firearm was six-fold higher in males than in females (1.15 per 100,000 and 0.19 per 100,000, respectively), and varied greatly across countries: the highest rates were in Greenland (24.52 per 100,000 and 2.69 per 100,000, respectively) and the United States of America (10.13 per 100,000 and 1.66 per 100,000, respectively), while the lowest rates (0.05 per 100,000 or less) were observed in China, Japan and Singapore. Globally, the mortality of suicide by firearm had a decreasing tendency from 1990 to 2019 in both sexes together (AAPC = -2.0% per year; 95%CI = -2.1 to -1.9). Conclusion Decreasing trends in mortality of suicide by firearm were observed in majority of countries across the world, but not in all. Future research should determine more effective ways to further reduce mortality of suicide by firearm."
https://openalex.org/W4281563049,"Scientists and astronomers have attached great importance to the task of discovering new exoplanets, even more so if they are in the habitable zone. To date, more than 4300 exoplanets have been confirmed by NASA, using various discovery techniques, including planetary transits, in addition to the use of various databases provided by space and ground-based telescopes. This article proposes the development of a deep learning system for detecting planetary transits in Kepler Telescope light curves. The approach is based on related work from the literature and enhanced to validation with real light curves. A CNN classification model is trained from a mixture of real and synthetic data. The model is then validated only with unknown real data. The best ratio of synthetic data is determined by the performance of an optimisation technique and a sensitivity analysis. The precision, accuracy and true positive rate of the best model obtained are determined and compared with other similar works. The results demonstrate that the use of synthetic data on the training stage can improve the transit detection performance on real light curves."
https://openalex.org/W4281570671,"Thiamin is a crucial vitamin with a vast variety of anti-oxidative and physiological roles in plants subjected to abiotic stresses. We examined the efficiency of foliar-applied thiamin (50 and 100 mM) on growth, yield quality and key-biochemical characteristics of two cultivars (FD1 and FD3) of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L.) under water-deficit stress. Water stress at the rate of 50% field capacity (F.C.) markedly decreased the plant biomass, leaf total phenolics and ascorbic acid (AsA) contents. In contrast, drought-induced increase was noted in the leaf [hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), AsA, proline, malondialdehyde (MDA), glycinebetaine (GB), total soluble proteins and oxidative defense system in terms of high activities of peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) enzymes] and the inflorescence (total phenolics, proline, GB, MDA, H2O2, and activities of SOD and CAT enzymes) characteristics of cauliflower. However, foliar-applied thiamin significantly improved growth and physio-biochemical attributes except leaf and inflorescence MDA and H2O2 contents of both cauliflower cultivars under water stress. Overall, application of thiamin enhanced the plant growth may be associated with suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) and upregulated antioxidants defense system of cauliflower."
https://openalex.org/W4285739890,"Cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a decreased ability to maintain body weight. As CKD advances, loss of body weight contributes to morbidity and mortality. The goal of this study was to evaluate the combined effects of feeding betaine and prebiotics on body weight of both CKD and healthy cats. The pre-trial food (control food) was a complete and balanced dry food designed to aid in the management of CKD. Test food was the control food supplemented with betaine (0.500%) and prebiotics: long-chain oat beta-glucan (0.586%) and 0.407% short chain fructooligosaccharides (scFOS). The CKD cats (n = 7) were fed pre-trial food for 28 days and then randomly assigned to control food or test food. Each food was fed for 8 weeks in a cross-over study design. In a second study, healthy cats received control food or test food for 8 weeks (n = 8 each group). Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected to evaluate concentrations of relevant kidney function biomarkers and metabolites at the end of each feeding period for CKD cats, and blood samples were collected monthly to evaluate concentrations of plasma metabolites for healthy cats. Body weight and composition were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan at baseline and after each feeding period. Total body mass was significantly higher in CKD cats after consuming test food compared with control food ( P = 0.004), with no significant difference in food intake while consuming test or control food ( P = 0.34). Test food did not affect total body mass or composition of healthy cats. Indole compounds produced by bacterial metabolism were decreased in urine and increased in feces of CKD cats fed test food, and plasma concentrations were negatively correlated with the level of kidney function, indicating a potential benefit of consuming test food. In healthy cats, consuming test food resulted in significantly decreased concentrations of plasma P-cresol sulfate ( P = 0.004) and increased concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; both P &lt; 0.05), despite the fact that both control and test foods had similar concentrations of these long-chain fatty acids, 0.03% and 0.02%, respectively. These results suggest that the addition of betaine and prebiotics to the control food formula may have increased total body mass in CKD cats by enhancing one-carbon metabolism and by modulating the gut microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W4285739969,"Both incidence and mortality of diagnosed diabetes have decreased over the past decade. However, the impact of these changes on key metrics of diabetes burden-lifetime risk (LR), years of potential life lost (YPLL), and years spent with diabetes-is unknown.We used data from 653,811 adults aged ≥18 years from the National Health Interview Survey, a cross-sectional sample of the civilian non-institutionalized population in the United States. LR, YPLL, and years spent with diabetes were estimated from age 18 to 84 by survey period (1997-1999, 2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014, 2015-2018). The age-specific incidence of diagnosed diabetes and mortality were estimated using Poisson regression. A multistate difference equation accounting for competing risks was used to model each metric.LR and years spent with diabetes initially increased then decreased over the most recent time periods. LR for adults at age 20 increased from 31.7% (95% CI: 31.2-32.1%) in 1997-1999 to 40.7% (40.2-41.1%) in 2005-2009, then decreased to 32.8% (32.4-33.2%) in 2015-2018. Both LR and years spent with diabetes were markedly higher among adults of non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and other races compared to non-Hispanic Whites. YPLL significantly decreased over the study period, with the estimated YPLL due to diabetes for an adult aged 20 decreasing from 8.9 (8.7-9.1) in 1997-1999 to 6.2 (6.1-6.4) in 2015-2018 (p = 0.02).In the United States, diabetes burden is declining, but disparities by race/ethnicity remain. LR remains high with approximately one-third of adults estimated to develop diabetes during their lifetime."
https://openalex.org/W4285740476,"Knowledge about placental malaria (PM) is insufficient in the world, and incipient in Colombia where studies are few and recent. In this country, PM has been reported by Plasmodium viva x, Plasmodium falciparum , and mixed infection. The objective was to determine the frequency of PM and its associated clinical-epidemiological factors in mothers and neonates in northwestern Colombia, 2009–2020. A Retrospective pooled analysis with 602 placentas captured in five investigations. The diagnosis of PM was made with thick blood smear (TBS) and qPCR. The groups with and without PM were compared using the Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test, and crude and adjusted prevalence ratios in a log-binomial model. The prevalence of PM was 27.7% with 92% (155/167) of submicroscopic cases; 41.3% by P . vivax , 44,3% by P . falciparum , and 14.4% by mixed infections. In the multivariate adjustment, PM was associated with the diagnosis of congenital malaria, low neonatal weight, gestational malaria, maternal anemia, previous malaria during pregnancy, and age between 25–43 years. This research is the investigation with the largest number of subjects for studying PM in Colombia, in the ecoepidemiological zone that produces more cases of malaria per year, finding a high prevalence of submicroscopic PM that caused serious maternal (anemia) and neonatal (congenital malaria and low neonatal weight) effects. The results show limitations in the timely diagnosis and treatment, given that the epidemiological surveillance program in Colombia is based on thick blood smear, which generates a substantial underestimation of the magnitude of PM, with serious effects and clinical risks. It is urgent to demand that the health authorities adopt measures such as prenatal control visits as soon as the pregnancy begins, monthly implementation of TBS, and active search for infected pregnant women in their homes and workplaces."
https://openalex.org/W4285743146,"Introduction We sought to evaluate the predictors and outcomes of mold peritonitis in patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD). Methods This cohort study included PD patients from the MycoPDICS database who had fungal peritonitis between July 2015-June 2020. Patient outcomes were analyzed by Kaplan Meier curves and the Log-rank test. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model regression was used to estimating associations between fungal types and patients’ outcomes. Results The study included 304 fungal peritonitis episodes (yeasts n = 129, hyaline molds n = 122, non-hyaline molds n = 44, and mixed fungi n = 9) in 303 patients. Fungal infections were common during the wet season ( p &lt;0.001). Mold peritonitis was significantly more frequent in patients with higher hemoglobin levels, presentations with catheter problems, and positive galactomannan (a fungal cell wall component) tests. Patient survival rates were lowest for non-hyaline mold peritonitis. A higher hazard of death was significantly associated with leaving the catheter in-situ (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 6.15, 95%confidence interval [CI]: 2.86–13.23) or delaying catheter removal after the diagnosis of fungal peritonitis (HR = 1.56, 95%CI: 1.00–2.44), as well as not receiving antifungal treatment (HR = 2.23, 95%CI: 1.25–4.01) or receiving it for less than 2 weeks (HR = 2.13, 95%CI: 1.33–3.43). Each additional day of antifungal therapy beyond the minimum 14-day duration was associated with a 2% lower risk of death (HR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.95–0.999). Conclusion Non-hyaline-mold peritonitis had worse survival. Longer duration and higher daily dosage of antifungal treatment were associated with better survival. Deviations from the 2016 ISPD Peritonitis Guideline recommendations concerning treatment duration and catheter removal timing were independently associated with higher mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4285745043,"Objective To apply biclustering, a methodology originally developed for analysis of gene expression data, to simultaneously cluster observations and clinical features to explore candidate phenotypes of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) for the first time. Methods Data from the baseline Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) visit were cleaned, transformed, and standardized as indicated (leaving 6461 knees with 86 features). Biclustering produced submatrices of the overall data matrix, representing similar observations across a subset of variables. Statistical validation was determined using the novel SigClust procedure. After identifying biclusters, relationships with key outcome measures were assessed, including progression of radiographic KOA, total knee arthroplasty, loss of joint space width, and worsening Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores, over 96 months of follow-up. Results The final analytic set included 6461 knees from 3330 individuals (mean age 61 years, mean body mass index 28 kg/m 2 , 57% women and 86% White). We identified 6 mutually exclusive biclusters characterized by different feature profiles at baseline, particularly related to symptoms and function. Biclusters represented overall better (#1), similar (#2, 3, 6), and poorer (#4, 5) prognosis compared to the overall cohort of knees, respectively. In general, knees in biclusters #4 and 5 had more structural progression (based on Kellgren-Lawrence grade, total knee arthroplasty, and loss of joint space width) but tended to have an improvement in WOMAC pain scores over time. In contrast, knees in bicluster #1 had less incident and progressive KOA, fewer total knee arthroplasties, less loss of joint space width, and stable pain scores compared with the overall cohort. Significance We identified six biclusters within the baseline OAI dataset which have varying relationships with key outcomes in KOA. Such biclusters represent potential phenotypes within the larger cohort and may suggest subgroups at greater or lesser risk of progression over time."
https://openalex.org/W4281383106,"Background The efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent rebleeding or infection after variceal bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis colonized with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) is unknown. Methods In this retrospective study, patients with liver cirrhosis and endoscopically confirmed variceal bleeding who were treated at a tertiary care center in Germany and were screened for MDROs at the time of bleeding were eligible for inclusion. Efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis was evaluated in patients stratified according to microbiological susceptibility testing. Results From 97 patients, the majority had decompensated liver cirrhosis (median MELD Score 17) and ACLF was present in half of the patients (47.4%). One third of patients were colonized with MDRO at baseline. De-novo infection until day 10 or the combination of de-novo infection or rebleeding were comparable among both groups (p = 0.696 and p = 0.928, log-rank-test). Risk of de-novo infection or rebleeding was not significantly increased in patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis that did not cover the MDRO found upon baseline screening. Acute-on-chronic liver failure at baseline was the strongest and only independent risk factor that was associated with both outcomes (OR 5.52, 95%-CI 1.48–20.61, p = 0.011 and OR 11.5, 95%-CI 2.70–48.62, p&lt;0.001). Neither MDRO colonization at baseline nor covering all detected MDRO with antibiotic prophylaxis (i.e. “adequate” prophylaxis) impacted transplant-free survival. Again, the presence of ACLF was the strongest independent risk factor associated with mortality (OR 9.85, 95%-CI 3.58–27.12, p&lt;0.0001). Conclusion In this study, MDRO colonization did not increase the risk of rebleeding, infections nor death, even if antibiotic prophylaxis administered did not cover all MDRO detected at MDRO screening. Patients with ACLF had an increased risk of bleeding, infections and death."
https://openalex.org/W4281383276,"Complete and understandable information is vital for informed consent and this includes how and when potential participants can expect to receive trial results. Informing participants during informed consent about the sharing of trial results is important for addressing participants' needs, ensuring adherence to regulatory guidance, and in fulfilling a moral obligation.Patient Information Leaflets (PILs) were collated from across the UK and Ireland. Trial characteristics and data on disseminating trial results was extracted. Analysis included descriptive statistics and a directed content analysis approach. The content analysis framework was informed by regulatory guidance on PIL content and existing research on dissemination of trial results. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics and presented as a narrative summary as appropriate.238 PILs from 178 trials were analysed. Of the 238 PILs, 74% (n = 176) provided information on sharing results with participants, 70% (n = 123) of which described passive methods of disseminating results that require active engagement from the trial participants, i.e., effort required by the participant to seek the results. The majority (90%) of PILs included more than one proposed mode of dissemination that largely targeted healthcare professionals rather than participants. Only 8% of PILs specified a time period for when results could be expected, 47% did not specify a time period (e.g. at end of trial), and 45% included no information on when trial results would be available.This study found that majority of the PILs included did include some information about dissemination of trial results. However, modes of dissemination tended to target researchers and clinicians rather than participants and information on when results would be available was often lacking. The findings highlight the need for further research that includes stakeholder input to identify what information on results summaries participants need at the point of making a decision about trial participation."
https://openalex.org/W4281383919,"Fear conditioning paradigms are critical to understanding anxiety-related disorders, but studies use an inconsistent array of methods to quantify the same underlying learning process. We previously demonstrated that selection of trials from different stages of experimental phases and inconsistent use of average compared to trial-by-trial analysis can deliver significantly divergent outcomes, regardless of whether the data is analysed with extinction as a single effect, as a learning process over the course of the experiment, or in relation to acquisition learning. Since small sample sizes are attributed as sources of poor replicability in psychological science, in this study we aimed to investigate if changes in sample size influences the divergences that occur when different kinds of fear conditioning analyses are used. We analysed a large data set of fear acquisition and extinction learning (N = 379), measured via skin conductance responses (SCRs), which was resampled with replacement to create a wide range of bootstrapped databases ( N = 30, N = 60, N = 120, N = 180, N = 240, N = 360, N = 480, N = 600, N = 720, N = 840, N = 960, N = 1080, N = 1200, N = 1500, N = 1750, N = 2000) and tested whether use of different analyses continued to produce deviating outcomes. We found that sample size did not significantly influence the effects of inconsistent analytic strategy when no group-level effect was included but found strategy-dependent effects when group-level effects were simulated. These findings suggest that confounds incurred by inconsistent analyses remain stable in the face of sample size variation, but only under specific circumstances with overall robustness strongly hinging on the relationship between experimental design and choice of analyses. This supports the view that such variations reflect a more fundamental confound in psychological science—the measurement of a single process by multiple methods."
https://openalex.org/W4281386087,"Purpose Head rotation is thought to have an effect on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity. However, keeping the head rotated fully during sleep is difficult to maintain, and the effect of head rotation is not the same in all OSA patients. Thus, this study aimed to identify whether less head rotation has an effect on airway patency and determine the responder characteristics to the head rotation maneuver (HRM). Methods We recruited 221 patients who underwent overnight polysomnography and drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) in a tertiary hospital from June 2019 to July 2020. Airway patency and the site of airway collapse were determined in the supine position with the head at 0, 30, and 60 degrees of rotation (HRM0°, HRM30°, and HRM60°, respectively) during DISE. The site of collapse was determined using the VOTE classification system: the velum (palate), oropharyngeal lateral walls, tongue base, and epiglottis. Each structure was labeled as 0, 1, or 2 (patent, partially obstructed, and completely obstructed, respectively). Airway response to the HRM30° and 60° and the clinical characteristics associated with airway opening were analyzed. Results The study population had a median age of 52 (25–61) years, a body mass index of 26.7(24.6–29.4) kg/m 2 , and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 28.2(13.7–71.9) events/h. HRM influenced airway patency positively not only with HRM60° (p&lt;0.001) but also following limited rotation (HRM30°, p &lt;0.001). Patients with tongue base (40.0% with HRM 60°) and epiglottic (52.6% with HRM 60°) collapse responded particularly well to HRM. Multivariate analysis revealed that lower AHI ( p &lt;0.001) and an absence of oropharyngeal lateral walls collapse ( p = 0.011) were significant predictors of responders to HRM. Conclusion Head rotation improved airway obstruction in OSA patients, even with a small degree of rotation, and should be further explored as a potential form of therapy in appropriately selected patients."
https://openalex.org/W4281389431,"Across Eurasia and North America, beaver (Castor spp), their dams and their human-built analogues are becoming increasingly common restoration tools to facilitate recovery of streams and wetlands, providing a natural and cost-effective means of restoring dynamic fluvial ecosystems. Although the use of beaver ponds by numerous fish and wildlife species is well documented, debate continues as to the benefits of beaver dams, primarily because dams are perceived as barriers to fish movement, particularly migratory species such as salmonids. In this study, through a series of field experiments, we tested the ability of juvenile salmonids to cross constructed beaver dams (aka beaver dam analogues). Two species, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and steelhead trout (O. mykiss), were tracked using passive integrated transponder tags (PIT tags) as they crossed constructed beaver dam analogues. We found that when we tagged and moved these fishes from immediately upstream of the dams to immediately downstream of them, most were detected upstream within 36 hours of displacement. By the end of a 21-day field experiment, 91% of the displaced juvenile coho and 54% of the juvenile steelhead trout were detected on antennas upstream of the dams. In contrast, during the final week of the 21-day experiment, just 1 of 158 coho salmon and 6 of 40 (15%) of the steelhead trout were still detected on antennas in the release pool below the dams. A similar but shorter 4-day pilot experiment with only steelhead trout produced similar results. In contrast, in a non-displacement experiment, juveniles of both species that were captured, tagged and released in a pool 50 m below the dams showed little inclination to move upstream. Further, by measuring hydraulic conditions at the major flowpaths over and around the dams, we provide insight into low-flow conditions under which juvenile salmonids are able to cross these constructed beaver dams, and that multiple types of flowpaths may be beneficial towards assisting fish movement past instream restoration structures. Finally, we compared estimates of the number of juvenile salmonids using the pond habitat upstream of the dam relative to the number that the dam may have prevented from moving upstream. Upstream of the dams we found an abundance of juvenile salmonids and a several orders of magnitude difference in favor of the number of juveniles using the pond habitat upstream of the dam. In sum, our study suggests beaver dams, BDAs, and other channel spanning habitat features should be preserved and restored rather than removed as perceived obstructions to fish passage."
https://openalex.org/W4281390535,"To conveniently replace worn cutterhead tools in complicated strata, a novel cutterhead attitude control mechanism was recently designed. Meanwhile, the mechanism also causes an engineering problem of how to control a matching cutterhead anti-torque system (CATS) effectively, which is used to prevent a drive box of the cutterhead from rotation during a complex excavation process. In this paper, a disturbance observer-based adaptive position controller is proposed for the CATS. The proposed method presents a nonlinear adaptive controller with adaptation laws to compensate for the unknown time-varying load torque and damping uncertainty in the system. Based on the disturbance observer method and sliding mode control, an asymptotically stable controller proven by Lyapunov theory is constructed using the back-stepping technique. In addition, a virtual test rig based on MATLAB and AMESim co-simulation is built to verify the validity of the proposed controller. The simulation results show that the proposed method has good performance for tracking tasks in the presence of uncertainties compared with PID control. Together, the data support targeting disturbance observer-based adaptive position control as a potential control strategy for cutterhead anti-torque systems."
https://openalex.org/W4281392394,"Visitor-centered approaches have been widely discussed in the museum experience research field. One notable approach was suggested by Falk and Dierking, who defined museum visitor experience as having a physical, personal, and social context. Many studies have been conducted based on this approach, yet the interactions between personal and social contexts have not been fully researched. Since previous studies related to these interactions have focused on the face-to-face conversation of visitor groups, attempts to provide the social information contributed by visitors have not progressed. To fill this gap, we examined such interactions in collaboration with the Lee-Ungno Art Museum in South Korea. Specifically, we investigated the influence of individual visitors' social contextual information about their art museum experience. This data, which we call ""visitor-based social contextual information"" (VSCI), is the social information individuals provide-feedback, reactions, or behavioral data-that can be applied to facilitate interactions in a social context. The study included three stages: In Stage 1, we conducted an online survey for a preliminary investigation of visitors' requirements for VSCI. In Stage 2, we designed a mobile application prototype. Finally, in Stage 3, we used the prototype in an experiment to investigate the influence of VSCI on museum experience based on visitors' behaviors and reactions. Our results indicate that VSCI positively impacts visitors' museum experiences. Using VSCI enables visitors to compare their thoughts with others and gain insights about art appreciation, thus allowing them to experience the exhibition from new perspectives. The results of this novel examination of a VSCI application suggest that it may be used to guide strategies for enhancing the experience of museum visitors."
https://openalex.org/W4281493029,"The black flying fox ( Pteropus alecto ) is a natural reservoir for Hendra virus, a paramyxovirus that causes fatal infections in humans and horses in Australia. Increased excretion of Hendra virus by flying foxes has been hypothesized to be associated with physiological or energetic stress in the reservoir hosts. The objective of this study was to explore the leukocyte profiles of wild-caught P . alecto , with a focus on describing the morphology of each cell type to facilitate identification for clinical purposes and future virus spillover research. To this end, we have created an atlas of images displaying the commonly observed morphological variations across each cell type. We provide quantitative and morphological information regarding the leukocyte profiles in bats captured at two roost sites located in Redcliffe and Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia, over the course of two years. We examined the morphology of leukocytes, platelets, and erythrocytes of P . alecto using cytochemical staining and characterization of blood films through light microscopy. Leukocyte profiles were broadly consistent with previous studies of P . alecto and other Pteropus species. A small proportion of individual samples presented evidence of hemoparasitic infection or leukocyte morphological traits that are relevant for future research on bat health, including unique large granular lymphocytes. Considering hematology is done by visual inspection of blood smears, examples of the varied cell morphologies are included as a visual guide. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first qualitative assessment of P . alecto leukocytes, as well as the first set of published hematology reference images for this species."
https://openalex.org/W4281554101,"Background Protection of islets without systemic immunosuppression has been a long-sought goal in the islet transplant field. We conducted a pilot biocompatibility/safety study in healthy dogs followed by a dose-finding efficacy study in diabetic dogs using polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) microencapsulated allogeneic canine islets. Methods Prior to the transplants, characterization of the canine islets included the calculations determining the average cell number/islet equivalent. Following measurements of purity, insulin secretion, and insulin, DNA and ATP content, the islets were encapsulated and transplanted interperitoneally into dogs via a catheter, which predominantly attached to the omentum. In the healthy dogs, half of the microspheres injected contained canine islets, the other half of the omentum received empty PEGDA microspheres. Results In the biocompatibility study, healthy dogs received increasing doses of cells up to 1.7 M cells/kg body weight, yet no hypoglycemic events were recorded and the dogs presented with no adverse events. At necropsy the microspheres were identified and described as clear with attachment to the omentum. Several of the blood chemistry values that were abnormal prior to the transplants normalized after the transplant. The same observation was made for the diabetic dogs that received higher doses of canine islets. In all diabetic dogs, the insulin required to attempt to control blood glucose was cut by 50–100% after the transplant, down to no required insulin for the course of the 60-day study. The dogs had no adverse events and behavioral monitoring suggested normal activity after recovery from the transplant. Conclusions and implications The study provides evidence that PEGDA microencapsulated canine islets reversed the signs of diabetes without immunosuppression and led to states of insulin-independence or significantly lowered insulin requirements in the recipients."
https://openalex.org/W4281561351,"Age of acquisition (AoA) is presumed to reflect the age or relative order in which words are learned, but is often measured using adult ratings or adult-reported observations and might thus reflect more about the adult language than about the acquisition process. Objective AoA estimates are often limited to words whose referents can be shown in pictures. We created a corpus-derived AoA estimate based on first word occurrences in a longitudinal corpus of child English, and evaluated its reliability and validity against other measures of AoA. Then we used these different measures as concurrent predictors of adult lexical decision times. Our results showed adequate reliability and good relations with other AoA measures, especially with parent-reported AoA (r = 0.56). Corpus AoA did not predict unique variance in lexical decision times, while adult AoA ratings and parent-reported AoA did. We argue that this pattern is due to two factors. First, the adult AoA ratings and parent-reported AoA are confounded with adult memory, lexical processing and reading difficulty variables. Second, the adult AoA ratings are related to actual age of acquisition only for words acquired during later preschool and school age. Our analyses support the utility of corpus-derived AoA estimates as an objective measure of acquisition age, especially for early-acquired words."
https://openalex.org/W4285739855,"Gathering public consensus about long-term urban open space development is more difficult than ever, even though public engagement is crucial for sustainable long-term policymaking. Routine evaluation of public awareness is important for retaining project momentum and designing appropriate public engagement processes for the future. This study focuses on the Yongsan Park Development Project, which has been in progress for more than three decades. An online survey of 2,000 respondents was conducted and analyzed to evaluate the current public awareness and ask questions about respondents' expectations for public engagement. The results of this study reveal that 1) a hybrid methodology is needed to effectively approach different age groups; 2) an online survey can offer new insights for projects that repurpose U.S. army base and military sites into urban open spaces; 3) the survey results will enable us to design a better public participation process that is appropriate for post-pandemic society, in which virtual meetings and socially distanced communications are part of the new norm."
https://openalex.org/W4285740534,"Background Transforaminal percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) is a widely used basic technique for lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with advantages including causing less trauma and fast recovery. The secure, efficient, and rapid enlargement of the intervertebral foramen is a key step in PELD procedures. However, the conventional multi-step trephine system for foraminoplasty involves complicated surgical procedures. In this study, we reported an improved one-step foraminoplasty via a large trephine with simplified surgical procedures, reduced radiation exposure, and shortened operative time. Methods 70 LDH patients who underwent PELD were retrospectively reviewed in this study. The conventional multi-step trephine system was used for foraminoplasty in 35 patients in the multi-step (MS) group, and the single large trephine was used in the other 35 patients in the one-step (OS) group. Indicators including the operative time, the time to establish the working cannula, intraoperative fluoroscopy times, the radiation dose, and postoperative complications were compared between the MS and OS group. Results The operative time and the time to establish the working cannula in the OS group was significantly shorter than that in the MS group (P &lt; 0.01); intraoperative fluoroscopy times and the radiation dose in the OS group were significantly smaller than those in the MS group (P &lt; 0.01). There was no statistical difference in the incidence of postoperative complications between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). The postoperative VAS scores and ODI scores (2 days and 3 months after the surgery) were significantly lower than the preoperative scores in both groups (P &lt; 0.01), and there was no statistical difference in VAS scores or ODI scores between the two groups at the same time points (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusions The one-step foraminoplasty via a single large trephine is an optimized technique evolving from the conventional multi-step foraminoplasty, showing significant superiority in simplified operation, shorted operative time, and reduced radiation exposure."
https://openalex.org/W4285742918,"Background Patient’s knowledge about dispensed medications is one of the major factors that determine the rational use of medicines. Objectives This study aimed to assess exit-knowledge of ambulatory patients about their dispensed medications and associated factors at the outpatient pharmacy of Mizan-Tepi University Teaching Hospital, Southwest Ethiopia. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from August to October 2021. Study subjects were selected by random sampling technique and were interviewed using a structured interview questionnaire. Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with exit knowledge. At a 95% confidence interval (CI), p ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result Of the total 400 participants, 116 (29.0%) participants had sufficient exit-knowledge about their dispensed medication. Patients with higher educational level had increased exit knowledge of dispensed medications than those with no formal education (AOR: 5.590; 95% CI 1.019–30.666). Also, the nature of illness as being chronic significantly enlarged the odds (AOR 5.807; 95% CI 2.965–11.372) of having sufficient exit-knowledge. Participants who reported, “I do not know” and “I did not get enough information from the pharmacist” had lower odds (AOR 0.374; 95% CI: 0.142–0.982) and (AOR 0.166; 95% CI 0.062–0.445) of sufficient exit-knowledge in comparison to those who responded “I got enough information from the pharmacist” respectively. Furthermore, the odd of sufficient exit-knowledge was 7.62 times higher in those who claimed prescribing doctor as the source of information. Conclusion The majority of patients had insufficient exit-knowledge about their dispensed medications. Educational status, nature of the disease, perceived sufficiency of pharmacist knowledge, and source of information were significantly associated with exit knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W4281489298,"Background In low-transmission settings, accurate estimates of malaria transmission are needed to inform elimination targets. Detection of antimalarial antibodies provides exposure history, but previous studies have mainly relied on species-specific antigens. The use of chimeric antigens that include epitopes from multiple species of malaria parasites in population-based serological surveys could provide data for exposure to multiple Plasmodium species circulating in an area. Here, the utility of P . vivax/P . falciparum chimeric antigen for assessing serological responses was evaluated in Ethiopia, an endemic country for all four human malarias, and Costa Rica, where P . falciparum has been eliminated with reports of sporadic P . vivax cases. Methods A multiplex bead-based assay was used to determine the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against a chimeric malaria antigen (PvRMC-MSP1) from blood samples collected from household surveys in Ethiopia in 2015 (n = 7,077) and Costa Rica in 2015 (n = 851). Targets specific for P . falciparum (PfMSP1) and P . vivax (PvMSP1) were also included in the serological panel. Seroprevalence in the population and seroconversion rates were compared among the three IgG targets. Results Seroprevalence in Costa Rica was 3.6% for PfMSP1, 41.5% for PvMSP1 and 46.7% for PvRMC-MSP1. In Ethiopia, seroprevalence was 27.6% for PfMSP1, 21.4% for PvMSP1, and 32.6% for PvRMC-MSP1. IgG levels in seropositive individuals were consistently higher for PvRMC-MSP1 when compared to PvMSP1 in both studies. Seroconversion rates were 0.023 for PvMSP1 and 0.03 for PvRMC-MSP1 in Costa Rica. In Ethiopia, seroconversion rates were 0.050 for PfMSP1, 0.044 for PvMSP1 and 0.106 for PvRMC-MSP1. Conclusions Our data indicate that chimeric antigen PvRMC-MSP1 is able to capture antibodies to multiple epitopes from both prior P . falciparum and P . vivax infections, and suitable chimeric antigens can be considered for use in serosurveys with appropriate validation."
https://openalex.org/W4281492276,"School engagement is an emerging strategy and proven potent vehicles for social and behavioral change communication (SBCC) intervention to prevent and control malaria. Little was known about the figurative speeches used in the malaria messages disseminated and communicated by school students. Therefore, this study evaluated the figurative speeches used in the poems to convey messages related to malarial perceptions, beliefs, norms and practices to prevent and control malaria.A qualitative content analysis was conducted to explore the figurative speeches used in malaria messages conveyed in poems produced by primary school students. Twenty poems were purposively selected from twenty schools across rural villages in five districts of Jimma Zone. Data were analyzed using ATLAS.ti version 7.1.4 software. The figurative speeches were presented using central themes and categories supported with quotations.The predominantly used figurative speeches were simile, metaphor, personification and hyperbole. Simile was used to express the nature of anopheles mosquito, and sign and symptoms of malaria. The metaphor was used to express malaria, severity/seriousness of malaria and Insecticide-Treated Net (ITN); and also to express the relationship between persons ITN malpractice and its effect on their health. Personification was used to express the nature of anopheles mosquito and malaria. Finally, hyperbole was used to express nature of anopheles mosquito, severity of malaria and exaggerated effect of ITN and Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS).The students conveyed messages related to malarial perceptions, beliefs, norms and practices of the local community to prevent and control malaria through different types of figurative speeches. Therefore, conceptualizing the local norms, beliefs, values, perception and practices, and expressing in different figurative speeches to convey messages and convince the local community might be important to bring the desired or intended behavioral change."
https://openalex.org/W4281552039,"Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) is a cell migration disorder associated with mutations in Filamin-A (FLNA) gene on chromosome X. Majority of the individuals with PNH-associated FLNA mutations are female whereas liveborn males with FLNA mutations are very rare. Fetal viability of the males seems to depend on the severity of the variant. Splicing or severe truncations presumed loss of function of the protein product, lead to male lethality and only partial-loss-of-function variants are reported in surviving males. Those variants mostly manifest milder clinical phenotypes in females and thus avoid detection of the disease in females.We describe a novel p.Arg484Gln variant in the FLNA gene by performing whole exome analysis on the index case, his one affected brother and his healthy non-consanguineous parents. The transmission of PNH from a clinically asymptomatic mother to two sons is reported in a fully penetrant classical X-linked dominant mode. The variant was verified via Sanger sequencing. Additionally, we investigated the impact of missense mutations reported in affected males on the FLNa protein structure, dynamics and interactions by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the disease etiology and possible compensative mechanisms allowing survival of the males.We observed that p.Arg484Gln disrupts the FLNa by altering its structural and dynamical properties including the flexibility of certain regions, interactions within the protein, and conformational landscape of FLNa. However, these impacts existed for only a part the MD trajectories and highly similar patterns observed in the other 12 mutations reported in the liveborn males validated this mechanism.It is concluded that the variants seen in the liveborn males result in transient pathogenic effects, rather than persistent impairments. By this way, the protein could retain its function occasionally and results in the survival of the males besides causing the disease."
https://openalex.org/W4281552060,"Rising migration numbers and the resulting increase in economic and sociocultural heterogeneity in societies all over the world are theorised to put pressure on the sustainable use of common-pool resources [CPRs]. Increased heterogeneity is argued to decrease trust and diversify interests between resource users, leading to overuse and decline of natural and man-made CPRs. The aim of this paper is to understand cooperative behaviour under economic and sociocultural heterogeneity in CPRs, through the analyses of experimental data including 344 subjects from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and 144 subjects from India. Multilevel regression, ordinal logistic regression, linear conditional-contribution profiles [LCPs] and agent-based models [ABMs] are used to analyse and replicate experimental outcomes on the micro- and macro-level. Results show that the combination of economic and sociocultural heterogeneity affects cooperation negatively when the decision-situation is perceived as unfair, but that neither economic nor sociocultural heterogeneity on themselves affect cooperation negatively. Economic heterogeneity is even found to affect cooperation positively relative to homogeneity. Player type classification based on LCP scores shows that experimental outcomes can be interpreted with player types, and ABM simulations validate the experimental results by replicating the main outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4281555636,"The Pediatric HIV Telemedicine Initiative is a video-linked delivery of expert services, designed to reach those previously unable to access expert HIV care. The present qualitative study was designed to understand the acceptability of telemedicine [TM] by patients, their caregivers and health care providers in the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centers in Maharashtra.We conducted focus group discussions with caregivers at six ART centres (three linked with TM facilities and three not linked with TM). We also conducted in-depth interviews with medical officers, counselors, and pharmacists at each centre. The data from the interviews were transcribed and translated into English for analysis. The qualitative data were analyzed using thematic framework approach.Children and caregivers who had participated in telemedicine consultation through video conference found the process acceptable, were comfortable communicating during these sessions, and did not have any specific problem to report. The advantages of TM were: consultation without having to travel to other cities; economic advantage; and prompt consultation. The total time spent during the process and technical difficulties during the TM sessions were some of the challenges. The medical officers had the opportunity to discuss difficult cases with the expert during the TM session. Some sessions were also considered a 'group counseling' session, wherein several children and caregivers were able to interact and learn from each other and motivate each other. The health care providers at the three centers that did not currently have TM facilities expressed a desire to have these services at their centers as well. According to them, these facilities will help them address complicated and difficult pediatric HIV cases. Currently, they send their patients to referral centers or other hospitals. Since, many of these referral hospitals are situated in bigger cities, less than 50% of patients access care at these centers This is mostly due to the time constraints and finances (travel/stay) required for accessing these centres.TM was a feasible, acceptable, and desired approach for care of children living with HIV/AIDS. It provides support to their caregivers as well as their care providers. The ART staff from the telemedicine-linked peripheral centers were supportive of the use of TM and wanted these services to be initiated in the non-linked centers."
https://openalex.org/W4285743689,"This study aimed to investigate whether use of a selective-blue-filtering (S-BF) lens can protect cultured primary porcine RPE cells against photo-irradiation. Transmittance of S-BF and UV-filtering (UVF) lenses was characterised spectrophotometrically. RPE cells were exposed to 1700 lux of white (peak λ at 443 and 533 nm; 0.44 mW/cm2) or blue (peak λ at 448 and 523 nm; 0.85 mW/cm2) LED light for 16 h to evaluate the influence of light source on the culture. The effect of the S-BF and UVF ophthalmic lenses on RPE cell cultures under blue light irradiation was then investigated. Cell viability was compared using trypan blue and MTT assays. Intracellular ROS production was detected by a fluorescein probe CM-H2DCFDA. Expression levels of catalase and Prdx3 were analysed by western blot. Trypan blue staining showed blue light caused more cell death than no light (p = 0.001) or white light (p = 0.005). MTT assay supported the hypothesis that exposure to blue light damaged RPE cells more severely than no light (p = 0.002) or white light (p = 0.014). Under blue light, use of the S-BF lens, which blocked 17% more blue light than the UVF lens, resulted in higher cellular viability (S-BF: 93.4±1.4% vs UVF: 90.6±1.4%; p = 0.022; MTT: 1.2-fold; p = 0.029). Blue and white light both significantly increased ROS production. The S-BF lens protected cells, resulting in lower levels of ROS and higher expression of catalase and Prdx3. To conclude, blue LED light exposure resulted in significant cytotoxicity to RPE cells. Partial blockage of blue light by an S-BF lens led to protective effects against retinal phototoxicity, which were mediated by reduction of ROS and increased levels of antioxidant enzymes."
