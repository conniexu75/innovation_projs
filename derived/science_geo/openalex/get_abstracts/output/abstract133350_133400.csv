https://openalex.org/W2105025553,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most frequent type of variation in the human genome, and they provide powerful tools for a variety of medical genetic studies. In a large-scale survey for SNPs, 2.3 megabases of human genomic DNA was examined by a combination of gel-based sequencing and high-density variation-detection DNA chips. A total of 3241 candidate SNPs were identified. A genetic map was constructed showing the location of 2227 of these SNPs. Prototype genotyping chips were developed that allow simultaneous genotyping of 500 SNPs. The results provide a characterization of human diversity at the nucleotide level and demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale identification of human SNPs."

The wild-type allele, COI1 , was mapped to a 90-kilobase genomic fragment and located by complementation of coi1-1 mutants. The predicted amino acid sequence of the COI1 protein contains 16 leucine-rich repeats and an F-box motif. It has similarity to the F-box proteins Arabidopsis TIR1, human Skp2, and yeast Grr1, which appear to function by targeting repressor proteins for removal by ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W1992529363,"CREB is a transcription factor implicated in the control of adaptive neuronal responses. Although one function of CREB in neurons is believed to be the regulation of genes whose products control synaptic function, the targets of CREB that mediate synaptic function have not yet been identified. This report describes experiments demonstrating that CREB or a closely related protein mediates Ca2+-dependent regulation of BDNF, a neurotrophin that modulates synaptic activity. In cortical neurons, Ca2+ influx triggers phosphorylation of CREB, which by binding to a critical Ca2+ response element (CRE) within the BDNF gene activates BDNF transcription. Mutation of the BDNF CRE or an adjacent novel regulatory element as well as a blockade of CREB function resulted in a dramatic loss of BDNF transcription. These findings suggest that a CREB family member acts cooperatively with an additional transcription factor(s) to regulate BDNF transcription. We conclude that the BDNF gene is a CREB family target whose protein product functions at synapses to control adaptive neuronal responses."
https://openalex.org/W2074305200,"A micromachined chemical amplifier was successfully used to perform the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in continuous flow at high speed. The device is analogous to an electronic amplifier and relies on the movement of sample through thermostated temperature zones on a glass microchip. Input and output of material (DNA) is continuous, and amplification is independent of input concentration. A 20-cycle PCR amplification of a 176-base pair fragment from the DNA gyrase gene of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was performed at various flow rates, resulting in total reaction times of 90 seconds to 18.7 minutes."
https://openalex.org/W2125256208,"Familial juvenile polyposis is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by a predisposition to hamartomatous polyps and gastrointestinal cancer. Here it is shown that a subset of juvenile polyposis families carry germ line mutations in the gene SMAD4 (also known as DPC4), located on chromosome 18q21.1, that encodes a critical cytoplasmic mediator in the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway. The mutant SMAD4 proteins are predicted to be truncated at the carboxyl-terminus and lack sequences required for normal function. These results confirm an important role for SMAD4 in the development of gastrointestinal tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2130837565,"A signaling pathway by which calcium influx regulates the expression of the major activity-dependent transcript of BDNF in cortical neurons has been elucidated. Deletion and mutational analysis of the promoter upstream of exon III reveals that transactivation of the BDNF gene involves two elements 5' to the mRNA start site. The first element, located between 72 and 47 bp upstream of the mRNA start site, is a novel calcium response element and is required for calcium-dependent BDNF expression in both embryonic and postnatal cortical neurons. The second element, located between 40 and 30 bp upstream of the mRNA start site, matches the consensus sequence of a cAMP response element (CRE) and is required for transactivation of the promoter in postnatal but not embryonic neurons. The CRE-dependent component of the response appears to be mediated by CREB since it is part of the complex that binds to this CRE, and since dominant negative mutants of CREB attenuate transactivation of the promoter. A constitutively active mutant of CaM kinase IV, but not of CaM kinase II, leads to activation of the promoter in the absence of extracellular stimuli, and partially occludes calcium-dependent transactivation. The effects of CaM kinase IV on the promoter require an intact CRE. These mechanisms, which implicate CaM kinase IV and CREB in the control of BDNF expression, are likely to be centrally involved in activity-dependent plasticity during development."
https://openalex.org/W2029149519,"RasGRP, a guanyl nucleotide–releasing protein for the small guanosine triphosphatase Ras, was characterized. Besides the catalytic domain, RasGRP has an atypical pair of “EF hands” that bind calcium and a diacylglycerol (DAG)-binding domain. RasGRP activated Ras and caused transformation in fibroblasts. A DAG analog caused sustained activation of Ras-Erk signaling and changes in cell morphology. Signaling was associated with partitioning of RasGRP protein into the membrane fraction. Sustained ligand-induced signaling and membrane partitioning were absent when the DAG-binding domain was deleted. RasGRP is expressed in the nervous system, where it may couple changes in DAG and possibly calcium concentrations to Ras activation."
https://openalex.org/W1987227930,"The mass extinction at the end of the Permian was the most profound in the history of life. Fundamental to understanding its cause is determining the tempo and duration of the extinction. Uranium/lead zircon data from Late Permian and Early Triassic rocks from south China place the Permian-Triassic boundary at 251.4 ± 0.3 million years ago. Biostratigraphic controls from strata intercalated with ash beds below the boundary indicate that the Changhsingian pulse of the end-Permian extinction, corresponding to the disappearance of about 85 percent of marine species, lasted less than 1 million years. At Meishan, a negative excursion in δ 13 C at the boundary had a duration of 165,000 years or less, suggesting a catastrophic addition of light carbon."

https://openalex.org/W2009074935,"Mice lacking the voltage-gated potassium channel alpha subunit, K(V)1.1, display frequent spontaneous seizures throughout adult life. In hippocampal slices from homozygous K(V)1.1 null animals, intrinsic passive properties of CA3 pyramidal cells are normal. However, antidromic action potentials are recruited at lower thresholds in K(V)1.1 null slices. Furthermore, in a subset of slices, mossy fiber stimulation triggers synaptically mediated long-latency epileptiform burst discharges. These data indicate that loss of K(V)1.1 from its normal localization in axons and terminals of the CA3 region results in increased excitability in the CA3 recurrent axon collateral system, perhaps contributing to the limbic and tonic-clonic components of the observed epileptic phenotype. Axonal action potential conduction was altered as well in the sciatic nerve--a deficit potentially related to the pathophysiology of episodic ataxia/myokymia, a disease associated with missense mutations of the human K(V)1.1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2130371690,"Synaptic transmission between dendrites in the olfactory bulb is thought to play a major role in the processing of olfactory information. Glutamate released from mitral cell dendrites excites the dendrites of granule cells, which in turn mediate GABAergic dendrodendritic inhibition back onto mitral dendrites. We examined the mechanisms governing reciprocal dendritic transmission in rat olfactory bulb slices. We find that NMDA receptors play a critical role in this dendrodendritic inhibition. As with axonic synapses, the dendritic release of fast neurotransmitters relies on N- and P/Q-type calcium channels. The magnitude of dendrodendritic transmission is directly proportional to dendritic calcium influx. Furthermore, recordings from pairs of mitral cells show that dendrodendritic synapses can mediate lateral inhibition independently of axonal action potentials."
https://openalex.org/W2011658104,"Mutations of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene are the most commonly detected alterations in familial breast and ovarian cancer. Although BRCA1 is required for normal mouse development, the molecular basis for its tumor suppressive function remains poorly understood. We show here that BRCA1 increases p53-dependent transcription from the p21WAF1/CIP1 and bax promoters. We also show that BRCA1 and p53 proteins interact both in vitro and in vivo. The interacting regions map, in vitro, to aa 224–500 of BRCA1 and the C-terminal domain of p53. Tumor-derived transactivation-deficient BRCA1 mutants are defective in co-activation of p53-dependent transcription and a truncation mutant of BRCA1 that retains the p53-interacting region acts as a dominant inhibitor of p53-dependent transcription. BRCA1 and p53 cooperatively induce apoptosis of cancer cells. The results indicate that BRCA1 and p53 may coordinately regulate gene expression in their role as tumor suppressors."

https://openalex.org/W2088013332,"Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration that results from mutation of the ATM gene. However, neither the normal function of ATM in the nervous system nor the biological basis of the degeneration in AT is known. Resistance to apoptosis in the developing central nervous system (CNS) of Atm −/− mice was observed after ionizing radiation. This lack of death occurred in diverse regions of the CNS, including the cerebellum, which is markedly affected in AT. In wild-type, but not Atm −/− mice, up-regulation of p53 coincided with cell death, suggesting that Atm-dependent apoptosis in the CNS is mediated by p53. Further, p53 null mice showed a similar lack of radiation-induced cell death in the developing nervous system. Atm may function at a developmental survival checkpoint that serves to eliminate neurons with excessive DNA damage."

Ferromagnetic coupling between Fe 3+ and Cr 3+ through oxygen has long been expected on the basis of Anderson, Goodenough, and Kanamori rules. Despite many studies of Fe-O-Cr–based compounds, random positioning of Fe 3+ and Cr 3+ ions has frustrated the observation of ferromagnetic properties. By creating artificial superlattices of Fe 3+ and Cr 3+ layer along the [111] direction, ferromagnetic ordering has been achieved."
https://openalex.org/W1998612644,"Little is known about the physiology of neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using new techniques for in situ patch-clamp recording in C. elegans, we analyzed the electrical properties of an identified sensory neuron (ASER) across four developmental stages and 42 unidentified neurons at one stage. We find that ASER is nearly isopotential and fails to generate classical Na+ action potentials. Rather, ASER displays a high sensitivity to input currents coupled to a depolarization-dependent reduction in sensitivity that may endow ASER with a wide dynamic range. Voltage clamp revealed depolarization-activated K+ and Ca2+ currents that contribute to high sensitivity near the zero-current potential. The depolarization-dependent reduction in sensitivity can be attributed to activation of K+ current at voltages where it dominates the net membrane current. The voltage dependence of membrane current was similar in all neurons examined, suggesting that C. elegans neurons share a common mechanism of sensitivity and dynamic range."
https://openalex.org/W2025853041,"Voltage-gated calcium channels are well characterized at neuronal somata but less thoroughly understood at the presynaptic terminal where they trigger transmitter release. In order to elucidate how the intrinsic properties of presynaptic calcium channels influence synaptic function, we have made direct recordings of the presynaptic calcium current (IpCa) in a brainstem giant synapse called the calyx of Held. The current was pharmacologically classified as P-type and exhibited marked inactivation. The inactivation was largely dependent upon the inward calcium current magnitude rather than the membrane potential, displayed little selectivity between divalent charge carriers (Ca2+, Ba2+ and Sr2+), and exhibited slow recovery. Simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic whole-cell recording revealed that IpCa inactivation predominantly contributes to posttetanic depression of EPSCs. Thus, because of its slow recovery, IpCa inactivation underlies this short-term synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2066902435,"Divergence and convergence of synaptic connections make a crucial contribution to the information processing capacity of the brain. Until recently, it was thought that transmitter released at a synapse affected only a specific postsynaptic cell. We show here that spillover of inhibitory transmitter at the Golgi to granule cell synapse produces significant cross-talk to non-postsynaptic cells, which is promoted both by the anatomical specialization of this glomerular synapse and by the presence of the high affinity alpha6 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptor in granule cells. Cross-talk is manifested as a novel slow rising and decaying small amplitude inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) that can also contribute a long-lasting component to more typical IPSCs, which is prolonged by inhibition of the neuronal GABA transporter GAT-1. Because of the long duration of IPSCs generated by spillover, the total charge carried is three times that of IPSCs generated by directly connected terminals. GABA spillover within the mossy fiber glomerulus may play an important role in regulating the number of granule cells active in the cerebellar cortex, a regulation that is suggested by theoretical models to optimize cerebellar information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2084359613,"We have identified the mouse telomerase reverse transcriptase component (mTERT) and demonstrate both substantial sequence homology to the human ortholog (hTERT), and the presence of reverse transcriptase and telomerase specific motifs. Furthermore, we show functional interchangeability with hTERT in in vitro telomerase reconstitution experiments, as mTERT produces strong telomerase activity in combination with the human telomerase RNA component hTR. The mouse TERT is widely expressed at low levels in adult tissues, with greatest abundance during embryogenesis and in adult thymus and intestine. The mTERT component mRNA levels were regulated during both differentiation and proliferation, while mTR levels remained constant throughout both processes. Comparison of mTERT and mTR levels to telomerase activity indicates that mTERT expression is more tightly linked to the regulation of telomerase activity during these processes than is mTR. In contrast to the situation in human cell cultures, mTERT transcript levels are present at readily detectable levels in primary cultured cells and are not upregulated following crisis. The widespread expression of mTERT in primary cells and mouse tissues could explain the increased frequency of spontaneous immortalization of mouse cells in culture and tumorigenesis in vivo."

One specimen includes a nearly complete and exquisitely preserved skull with thickened pneumatic nasals, a median frontal horn, and a dorsal projection on the parietals. The new materials are assigned to the enigmatic theropod group Abelisauridae on the basis of a number of unique features. Fossil remains attributable to abelisaurids are restricted to three Gondwanan landmasses: South America, Madagascar, and the Indian subcontinent. This distribution is consistent with a revised paleogeographic reconstruction that posits prolonged links between these landmasses (via Antarctica), perhaps until late in the Late Cretaceous."

https://openalex.org/W2157438849,"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 Cip1/WAF1 has been implicated as an inducer of differentiation. However, although expression of p21 is increased in postmitotic cells immediately adjacent to the proliferative compartment, its expression is decreased in cells further along the differentiation program. Expression of the p21 protein was decreased in terminally differentiated primary keratinocytes of mice, and this occurred by a proteasome-dependent pathway. Forced expression of p21 in these cells inhibited the expression of markers of terminal differentiation at both the protein and messenger RNA levels. These inhibitory effects on differentiation were not observed with a carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant or with the unrelated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 INK4a , although all these molecules exerted similar inhibition of cell growth. These findings reveal an inhibitory role of p21 in the late stages of differentiation that does not result from the effects of p21 on the cell cycle."

The ground motion from a thrust or reverse fault is larger than that of a normal fault by a factor of 2 or more, given identical initial stress magnitudes. The motion of the hanging wall is larger than that of the footwall in both thrust (reverse) and normal earthquakes. The asymmetry between normal and thrust (reverse) faults results from time-dependent normal stress caused by the interaction of the earthquake-generated stress field with Earth's free surface. The asymmetry between hanging wall and footwall results from the asymmetric mass and geometry on the two sides of the fault."
https://openalex.org/W2058733098,"Deletions involving chromosome 10q23 occur frequently in prostatic carcinomas. Recently, a novel tumour suppressor gene, PTEN, mapping to this interval, has been identified. Mutation or deletion of PTEN has been observed in a proportion of prostate cancer cell lines; however, primary prostate carcinomas have not been studied. We have investigated the involvement of PTEN in primary prostatic adenocarcinomas using a panel of 51 matched normal and prostate tumour DNAs. We first determined the proportion of tumours with allele loss at loci in 10q23 which span the region containing the PTEN gene. Our results show that LOH involving 10q23 is common in primary prostate carcinomas. Twenty-five of 51 (49%) tumours showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) over the region spanning the PTEN locus. We next directly analysed the PTEN gene for mutations of the coding region using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequence analyses. Of those tumours with LOH, only a single tumour was found to carry a missense mutation in PTEN. No mutations in PTEN were identified in tumours without LOH. Our results suggest either that mutation of PTEN is a late event in prostate tumorigenesis, or that another tumour suppressor gene important in prostate cancer may lie close to PTEN in 10q23."

Within the G:C base pair, deamination results in the formation of xanthine and uracil, respectively. To determine the effect of DNA structure on the deamination of guanine and cytosine, the NOċ-induced deamination rate constants for deoxynucleosides, single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides, and a G-quartet oligonucleotide were measured. Deamination rate constants were determined relative to morpholine using a Silastic membrane to deliver NOċ at a rate of ~10–20 nmol/ml/min for 60 min, yielding a final concentration of ~600–1200 μm NO2−. GC/MS analysis revealed formation of nanomolar levels of deamination products from millimolar concentrations of deoxynucleosides and oligomers. Deamination rate constants for cytosine and guanine in all types of DNA were lower than the morpholine nitrosation rate constant by a factor of ~103–104. Xanthine was formed at twice the rate of uracil, and this may have important consequences for mechanisms of NOċ-induced mutations. Single-stranded oligomers were 5 times more reactive than deoxynucleosides toward N2O3. Double-stranded oligomers were 10-fold less reactive than single-stranded oligomers, suggesting that Watson-Crick base pairing protects DNA from deamination.

Nitric oxide (NOċ) 1The abbreviations used are: NOċ, nitric oxide; GC/MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Mor, morpholine; dGuo, deoxyguanosine; dCyd, deoxycytidine. is an important physiological messenger that is involved in many processes in vivo, including inhibition of platelet aggregation, blood vessel relaxation, and neurotransmission (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). NOċ, along with its many essential roles in vivo, can also undergo reactions that may result in cytotoxic or mutagenic events by a number of possible mechanisms. Nitric oxide reacts with oxygen, for example, to form the nitrosating agent nitrous anhydride, N2O3, which can then react with amines, thiols, and other available nucleophiles. N2O3, which is also formed from acidic nitrite, can nitrosate primary amine functionalities on DNA bases, leading to direct DNA damage via deamination. Deamination of cytosine, adenine, guanine, and 5-methylcytosine forms uracil, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and thymine, respectively. DNA bases can also undergo “spontaneous” hydrolytic deamination (2Singer B. Grunberger D. Molecular Biology of Mutagens and Carcinogens. Plenum Press, New York1983: 19-22Google Scholar). Both spontaneous and nitrosative deamination presumably occur via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but the nitrosative pathway would be favored by the better leaving group, i.e.-N2OH2+ or -N2+ versus-NH3+ (3Gould E.S. Mechanism and Structure in Organic Chemistry. 1959; (, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York): 452-458Google Scholar, 4Carey F.A. Sundberg R.J. Advanced Organic Chemistry Part A: Structure and Mechanisms. Plenum Press, New York1990: 579-587Google Scholar). These pathways are summarized, with cytosine as the example, in Fig.1. Pyrimidine bases in DNA are more susceptible to spontaneous deamination than are the purine bases (5Shapiro R. Klein R.S.

This is demonstrated by the previous observation of significant cytosine deamination but no guanine deamination upon heating of the synthetic copolymer poly(dG-dC):poly(dG-dC) and the homopolymer poly(dG):poly(dC) (7Duker N.J.

Purine constituents, however, were found to be more easily deaminated by nitrous acid (9Shapiro R. Yamaguchi H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 281: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Deamination of DNA bases can lead to mutagenesis through misincorporation by DNA polymerase, misrepair, or no repair of the resulting deamination products. The types of mutations that potentially arise from deamination of DNA bases are summarized in Table I. Given the reports of nitric oxide-induced toxicity (10Nguyen T. Brunson D. Crespi C.L.

The predominant mutation resulting from NOċ treatment is G:C → A:T (12Wink D.A. Kasprzak K.S. Maragos C.M. Elespuru R.K. Misra M. Dunams T.M. Cebula T.A. Koch W.H. Andrews A.W. Allen J.S. Keefer L.K.

Our main interest, therefore, was to determine the rate constants for deamination of these two compounds. The deaminations of adenine and 5-methylcytosine were not included in this study. The rates of nitric oxide-induced deamination of DNA bases in different environments are not known. In order to reveal the effects of base pairing and helix structure on nitrosation chemistry, we investigated the rates of guanine and cytosine deamination when these bases are components of 2′-deoxynucleosides, single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides, and a G-quartet oligonucleotide. G-quartet structures (i.e.tetraplexes of four parallel strands in which each guanine donates and accepts two hydrogen bonds) form among the tandem repeats of G-rich sequences in telomeric DNA (18Williamson J.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 703-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar).

The Silastic membrane delivery system, which maintains a steady state and a very low dose rate (~10–20 nmol/ml/min) of NOċ, was used for most experiments. This system works ideally for compounds, such as the nucleosides and oligomers, with similar nitrosation rate constants. However, in order to determine the actual rate constant for the 2′-deoxyguanosine/N2O3 reaction, a kinetic reactor developed by Lewis et al. (19Lewis R.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Deen W.M. J. Am. Chem.

In this reactor, lower amounts of NOċ can be delivered, resulting in a very steady pH and therefore constant concentrations of free morpholine. The Silastic system is not amenable for use with compounds such as morpholine because the higher amounts of NOċ result in a slight pH drop and consequent unsteady levels of free morpholine. It is not possible to increase the buffer concentrations to maintain the pH because of the N2O3 scavenging effects that have been observed for several buffer anions (20Caulfield J.L. Singh S.P.

Nature. 1967; 216: 943-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). For these reasons, the kinetic reactor was used for the morpholine/2′-dGuo reaction. The rate constant for the morpholine/N2O3 reaction relative to N2O3 hydrolysis is known (4.0 × 104m−1). The rate constant for the 2′-deoxyguanosine/N2O3 reaction relative to N2O3 hydrolysis can therefore be found via the competitive-kinetics approach developed by Keshive et al.(22Keshive M. Singh S. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Deen W.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), i.e. by comparing the levels of the nitrosation product (xanthine) to the levels of N-nitrosomorpholine following exposure of a mixture of the two compounds to NOċ. Using a value for k 4 of 1600 s−1(19Lewis R.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Deen W.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3933-3939Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the rate constant for the 2′-Guo/N2O3reaction (k 7G) can then be calculated. The rate constants for reaction of N2O3 with 2′-deoxycytidine, a G-quartet oligonucleotide, and single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides containing guanine and cytosine were based on the previously determined 2′-deoxyguanosine rate constant by using reaction mixtures containing one component for which the rate constant for reaction with N2O3 was known. Using these rate constants, it is possible to determine whether guanine or cytosine is deaminated faster within a G:C base pair. In addition, conclusions can be made regarding the effects of base pairing on deamination chemistry, which will contribute to an understanding of NOċ-induced modifications to DNA. 2′-Deoxycytidine and 2′-deoxyguanosine were purchased from Sigma, and morpholine was purchased from Aldrich. The synthetic oligonucleotides AACCCCAA, TTGGGGTT, TGTGTGTG, and CGCGCGCGCGCG were obtained from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Biopolymers Laboratory. Phosphate buffer (0.01 m) at pH 7.4 was prepared with K2HPO4 and KH2PO4 using double-distilled water. 100% nitric oxide and 10% nitric oxide in argon (Matheson, Gloucester, MA) were passed through a column of 4–8 mesh soda lime to remove NOx impurities. Silastic tubing (0.025 in ID × 0.047 in OD) was purchased from Dow Corning Corp. (Midland, MI). Sep-Pak tC18 cartridges were obtained from Waters Associates (Bedford, MA). [1,3-15 N 2]Xanthine and [1,3-15 N 2]uracil were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Cambridge, MA). Silylation grade acetonitrile, pyridine, andN-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (MT-BSTFA) were purchased from Pierce. A 200-ml kinetic reactor was used as described previously (22Keshive M. Singh S. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Deen W.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), with a few modifications. First, the total amount of NOċdelivered was ~80 μm in these experimentsversus ~30 μm in previous work. Second, the flow loop to the spectrophotometer was disconnected because UV detection cannot be used to simultaneously monitor xanthine andN-nitrosomorpholine product concentrations. Because UV detection could not be used, samples were withdrawn from the reactor immediately before O2 addition and 30 min after O2 addition (i.e. prereaction and postreaction samples). Using a gas-tight syringe that had previously been deoxygenated with argon, 600 μl of the reaction mixture was withdrawn and added to 400 μl of a 0.15 m azide solution to quench any N2O3 present. Due to the fact that there is dissolved nitric oxide in the prereaction sample, high concentrations of azide are needed to prevent reaction of N2O3with morpholine or 2′-deoxyguanosine. Complete N2O3 scavenging was confirmed by omitting morpholine from the reaction mixture but including it in the azide solution and determining that there was noN-nitrosomorpholine formation. Approximately 80 μm NOċ was delivered to a solution of 3 mm 2′-deoxyguanosine and 0.5–1.5 mm morpholine in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The resulting levels of xanthine and N-nitrosomorpholine were quantitated by GC/MS as described below. A portion (200 μl) of the prereaction and postreaction samples was withdrawn, and 50 μl of a 48.4 μm nitrobenzene solution was added for use as an internal standard. The aqueous sample was extracted with methylene chloride (300 μl), and the organic layer was analyzed forN-nitrosomorpholine and nitrobenzene using a Supelcowax column obtained from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA). Analysis was performed on an HP 5989 GC/MS apparatus in the electron ionization mode. Quantitation was based on a standard curve. A portion (100 μl) of the prereaction and postreaction samples was withdrawn, and 50 μl of a 100 pg/μl [1,3-15 N 2]xanthine solution and 50 μl of a 100 pg/μl [1,3-15 N 2]uracil solution were added as internal standards. Acid hydrolysis was performed in Reacti-Vials using 500 μl of 60% formic acid at 100 °C for 1 h. Samples were then dried in a Speed Vac. Sep-Pak tC18cartridges were used, and the methanol eluant was dried completely in a Speed Vac. Samples were derivatized in a Reacti-Vial with 15 μl of acetonitrile, 10 μl of pyridine, and 25 μl ofN-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide at 130 °C for 30 min and analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard HP-5 column. The oligonucleotides studied are shown in Table II. The experimental mixtures were as follows: 1) 1 mm 2′-dGuo and 1 mm 2′-dCyd, 2) 0.25 mm AACCCCAA and 1 mm 2′-dGuo, 3) 0.25 mm TGTGTGTG and 1 mm 2′-dCyd, 4) 0.25 mm TTGGGGTT and 1 mm 2′-dCyd, and 5) 0.18 mm CGCGCGCGCGCG and 1 mm 2′-dCyd. All NOċ treatments were carried out in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. After passing through a column of 4–8 mesh soda lime, NOċ was introduced as a mixture of 10% NOċ in argon using a Silastic membrane system shown in Fig. 2 and as described by Tamiret al. (23Tamir S. Lewis R.S. de Rojas Walker T. Deen W.M. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For sample 1, a 7-ml volume was treated via 10 cm of Silastic tubing for 1 h. For samples 2–5, a volume of 1.5 ml was treated via 2 cm of Silastic tubing for 1 h. All solutions were stirred to minimize the boundary layer at the polymer-liquid interface. The total amount of NOċ actually delivered was measured at the end of each experiment as total nitrite (24Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10828) Google Scholar). In all experiments, the nitric oxide delivery rate was ~10–20 nmol/ml/min, resulting in a final NO2− concentration of ~600–1200 μm. Samples were analyzed for xanthine and uracil by GC/MS as described above. An additional step, involving separation of the oligomer from the deoxynucleoside using Millipore Ultrafree-MC 2,000 NMWL Filter Units, was necessary for the double-stranded oligomer. The oligomer is retained by the filter and recovered in the retentate, whereas the deoxynucleoside is found in the filtrate. Separation was confirmed in individual trial experiments with each component.Table IIOligonucleotides used in this studySingle-stranded oligonucleotides AACCCCAA TGTGTGTGDouble-stranded oligonucleotide CGCGCGCGCGCGG-quartet oligonucleotide TTGGGGTT Open table in a new tab In previous experiments, Lewis et al. (19Lewis R.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Deen W.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3933-3939Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar) showed that the principal nitrosating agent in the NOċ oxidation pathway at physiological pH is N2O3, which leads primarily to NO2− as summarized in Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3.2NO+O2→k1=2.1×106M−2s−12NO2Equation 1 NO+NO2⇄k3=4.3×106s−1k2=1.1×109M−1s−1N2O3Equation 2 N2O3+H2O⇄k5=5.6M−1s−1k4=1.6×103s−12HNO2⇄2NO2−+2H+Equation 3 N2O3 can also react with phosphate, chloride, and bicarbonate (19Lewis R.S.

In a competitive kinetics approach, however, these effects do not need to be included in the kinetic analysis (22Keshive M. Singh S. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Deen W.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Morpholine nitrosation by N2O3 is shown in Equation 4.N2O3+Mor→k6=6.4×107M−1s−1NMor+NO2−+H+Equation 4 In the above reaction scheme, all reaction rate constants are known. The first unknown rate constant to be determined was for the 2′-dGuo/N2O3 reaction shown below.N2O3+G→k7GX+NO2−+H+Equation 5 The complete kinetic analysis for estimating the unknown rate constant k 7 can be found in Ref. 22Keshive M. Singh S. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Deen W.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar. Using that analysis, the rates of formation of NMor and X are as follows.d[NMor]dt=k6[Mor0][N2O3]Equation 6 d[X]dt=k7G[G][N2O3]Equation 7 Combining Equations 6 and 7, we obtain,d[X]d[NMor]=k7G[G]k6[Mor0]Equation 8 where [Mor0] is the concentration of unprotonated morpholine that is available for nitrosation. Integration of Equation 8with the assumption that [G] and [Mor0] are essentially constant during the reaction, gives the equation,k7G=k6Δ[X][Mor0]Δ[NMor][G]Equation 9 where Δ[X] and Δ[NMor] represent the changes in the respective concentrations during the reaction (i.e.postreaction amounts minus prereaction levels). Rearrangement of Equation 9 gives the following equation.Δ[X][Mor0]=k7G/k4k6/k4Δ[NMor][G]Equation 10 The rate constant for 2′-dGuo/N2O3(k 7G/k 4) was determined from the slope of the plot of Δ[X][Mor0 ]versus Δ[NMor][G] and the previously reported value for k 6/k 4 (4 × 104m−1) (22Keshive M. Singh S. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Deen W.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The rate constant for the reaction of N2O3 with 2′-dCyd was determined using the rate constant for the 2′-dGuo/N2O3 reaction relative to N2O3 hydrolysis found above (k7G/k4), the amounts of xanthine and uracil formed during the 2′-dCyd/2′-dGuo treatment, and the following equation, which arises from the same theory as Equation 9above.k7Ck4=k7Gk4Δ[U][G]Δ[X][C]Equation 11 The rate constants for the reaction of N2O3 with single-stranded oligomers and the G-quartet oligomer were determined using the known rate constants for the 2′-dGuo/N2O3 reaction and 2′-dCyd/N2O3 reaction relative to N2O3 hydrolysis, the amounts of xanthine and uracil formed during the oligomer/deoxynucleoside reactions, and the following equations.k7C(oligo)k4=k7Gk4Δ[U][G]Δ[X][C(oligo)]Equation 12 k7G(oligo)k4=k7Ck4Δ[X][C]Δ[U][G(oligo)]Equation 13 The rate constants for the reaction of N2O3 with cytosine and guanine in the double-stranded oligomer were determined using the amounts of xanthine and uracil formed from the oligomer, the amount of uracil arising from 2′-dCyd upon treatment of the double-stranded oligomer/2′-dCyd mixture, and the following equations.k7C(oligo)k4=k7Ck4Δ[U(oligo)][C]Δ[U][C(oligo)]Equation 14 k7G(oligo)k4=k7Ck4Δ[X(oligo)][C]Δ[U][G(oligo)]Equation 15 The unprotonated form of morpholine is the substrate for nitrosation and is thus the most important form of morpholine for these experiments. Denoting total morpholine as Mor and the unprotonated form as Mor0, the respective concentrations are related by the equation,[Mor0]=[Mor]1+10pK−pHEquation 16 where the pK for morpholine at 25 °C is 8.5. The amount of morpholine available for nitrosation at pH 7.4 is 7.4% of the total morpholine concentration. The pH during a given reaction was essentially constant, i.e. the concentration of unprotonated morpholine did not change significantly. In all experiments, some nitrosation products were present in the solution prior to introduction of O2 due to a small air leak that could not be eliminated. From the plot of Equation10, the 2′-dGuo/N2O3 rate constant is calculated to be k 7G = 2.2 ± 0.2 m−1s−1. Results are summarized in Table III. In one experiment, morpholine was not present in the reaction mixture but was included in the azide mixture when samples were withdrawn from the reactor to ensure that there was no nitrosation occurring from the nitric oxide present in the prereaction sample. No detectable N-nitrosomorpholine was observed, indicating that the N2O3 was efficiently scavenged by the azide and that the levels of xanthine andN-nitrosomorpholine reported in the prereaction samples are accurate.Table IIIRate constants for reaction of N2O3 with 2′-deoxynucleosides, single- and double-stranded oligomers, and G-quartet oligomers relative to N2O3 hydrolysisRate constantm−12′-Deoxynucleosides 2′-dCydk 7C/k 4 = 7.0 ± 1 2′-dGuok 7G/k 4 = 14 ± 1Single-stranded oligonucleotides AACCCCAAk 7C/k 4 = 35 ± 7 TGTGTGTGk 7G/k 4 = 61 ± 8Double-stranded oligonucleotide CGCGCGCGCGCGk 7C/k 4 = 3.5 ± 0.6k 7G/k 4 = 6.3 ± 0.9G-quartet oligonucleotide TTGGGGTTk 7G/k 4 = 46 ± 7 Open table in a new tab As shown in Table III, the rate constant for the 2′-dCyd/N2O3 reaction was determined to be k 7C = 1.1 ± 0.2 × 104m−1s−1 based on the rate constant for the 2′-dGuo/N2O3 reaction above and the amounts of xanthine and uracil formed upon treatment of the 2′-dCyd/2′-dGuo mixture using Equation 11. The rate constant for N2O3 with cytosine in the single-stranded oligonucleotide AACCCCAA was found to bek 7C(oligo) = 5.6 ± 1.1 × 104m−1s−1 using Equation 12, the 2′-dGuo/N2O3 rate constant, and the amounts of xanthine and uracil found upon 2′-dGuo/AACCCCAA oligo treatment. The rate constant for guanine within the single-stranded oligonucleotide TGTGTGTG was found to be 9.8 ± 1.3 × 104m−1s−1using Equation 13, the 2′-dCyd/N2O3 rate constant, and the xanthine and uracil amounts found upon 2′-dCyd/TGTGTGTG oligo treatment. Similarly, the rate constant for the reaction of N2O3 with guanine in the G-quartet oligonucleotide TTGGGGTT was found to bek 7G(oligo) = 7.4 ± 1.1 × 104m−1s−1. As seen in Table III, the rate constant for the reaction of cytosine in the double-stranded oligonucleotide CGCGCGCGCGCG was found to bek 7C(oligo) = 5.6 ± 1.0 × 103m−1s−1 using Equation 14, the amounts of uracil arising from the oligo, amounts of uracil from 2′-dCyd, and the previously determined 2′-dCyd/N2O3 rate. Similarly, the rate constant for the reaction of guanine in the double-stranded oligonucleotide was calculated to be k 7C(oligo) = 1.0 ± 0.1 × 104m−1s−1 using Equation 15. Mutations may ultimately result from deamination of any of the bases shown in Table I. The G:C → A:T transition, which could result from the deamination of either guanine, cytosine, or 5-methylcytosine, has frequently been observed as the primary type of mutation upon NOċ treatment (26Kamiya H. Shimizu M. Suzuki M. Inoue H. Ohtsuka E. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1992; 11: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Coulondre C. Miller J.H. Farabaugh P.J. Gilbert W.

Focusing on the G:C base pair, this study was intended to determine whether guanine or cytosine is deaminated faster to give rise to the G:C → A:T mutation. The possible mutagenic effects of cytosine and guanine deamination forming uracil and xanthine, respectively, are discussed below. Deamination of cytosine will lead to a G:C → A:T transition mutation upon replication due to pairing of uracil with adenine (27Coulondre C. Miller J.H. Farabaugh P.J. Gilbert W. Nature. 1978; 274: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 28Duncan B.K. Miller J.H. Nature. 1980; 287: 560-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the uracil may be removed by the enzyme DNA uracil glycosylase prior to replication (29Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3649-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Uracil glycosylase excises uracil from both single- and double-stranded DNA with preference for single-stranded DNA (30Domena J.D. Timmer R.T. Dicharry S.A. Mosbaugh D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6742-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The importance of cytosine deamination is emphasized by the fact that organisms that lack this enzyme have an increased spontaneous mutation rate and more G:C → A:T transitions (31Duncan B.K. Weiss B. Hanawalt P.C. Friedberg E.C. Fox C.F. DNA Repair Mechanisms. Academic Press, New York1978: 183-186Crossref Google Scholar). Deamination of guanine to xanthine will lead to a G:C → A:T transition mutation upon replication because xanthine is believed to base pair with thymine (26Kamiya H. Shimizu M. Suzuki M. Inoue H. Ohtsuka E. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1992; 11: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Eritja R. Horowitz D.M. Walker P.A. Ziehler-Martin J.P. Boosalis M.S. Goodman M.F. Itakura K. Kaplan B.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 24: 168-175Google Scholar). There is no known repair mechanism for xanthine. The N-glycoside bond of deoxyxanthosine is acid-labile (33Shapiro R. Pohl S.H. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 34Shapiro H.S. Chargaff E. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3012-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); therefore, one possible fate of xanthine is depurination to form an abasic site. Many organisms will replicate past such a lesion by incorporating the “A rule,” i.e. by inserting an adenine opposite the abasic site (35Loeb L.A."
https://openalex.org/W2016351010,"Interaction of IL-3 with its receptor is known to activate STAT-3 via phosphorylation of Tyrosine 701, which facilitates its dimerization and translocation to the nucleus, leading to the transcription of its target genes. In this communication, we have investigated the nature of tyrosine kinases that mediate STAT-3 phosphorylation during IL-3-mediated activation of myeloid cell proliferation. Our results show that interaction of IL-3 with its receptor leads to the activation of c-Src kinase activity, which in turn facilitates the binding of c-Src to STAT-3. This association leads to the phosphorylation of STAT-3, allowing this transcription factor to translocate to the nucleus. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of src (AMSrc) in these cells results in a block to IL-3 mediated phosphorylation of STAT-3, and its ability to bind to DNA. On the other hand, expression of a dominant negative mutant of JAK2 (JAK2KE) had no effect on IL-3-mediated activation of STAT-3. Our results also show that AMSrc does not affect the phosphorylation of JAK2, suggesting that JAK and STAT phosphorylation events are mediated by two independent pathways. Inhibition of c-Src activation by AMSrc, which leads to a block to STAT-3 activation, results in a dramatic inhibition of cell proliferation mediated by IL-3. However, expression of AMSrc does not activate apoptotic pathways. In contrast, expression of JAK2KE results in accelerated apoptosis of 32Dcl3 cells grown in the absence of IL-3 with concomitant down-regulation of Erk-2 kinase activity. These results suggest that Src family kinases mediate the phosphorylation of STATs and play a critical role in signal transduction pathways associated with myeloid cell proliferation while JAK kinases mediate the activation of Erk-2 pathway which appears to provide anti-apoptotic signals. Thus the activation of JAKs and STATs appear to be two independent but related events, which dictate two separate biological outcomes, the combination of which results in proliferation and survival of myeloid precursor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2316316905,"Recent studies have suggested that different mutation types within the core domain of the tumour suppressor protein p53, i.e. DNA contact mutations and structural mutations, confer different biological properties. We have analysed in 86 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), whether these p53 mutation types have a differential clinical impact. Thirty-seven missense mutations were identified. Thirteen of these (36%) were DNA contact mutations, occurring in the L3 loop, in the H2 loop sheet helix motif, in the S10 β strand and in Zinc binding residues. Microsatellite marker analysis revealed a selective association between these mutations and the loss of wild-type alleles (100% LOH vs 50% LOH in tumours with structural mutations; P=0.0034, Fisher's exact, 2-tailed). In comparison to structural mutations or to the absence of mutations in the core domain, DNA contact mutations were associated with higher tumour stages (84.6% vs 62%), a higher incidence of lymph node metastasis (91.7% vs 56%; P=0.014, Fisher's exact, 2-tailed), a shortened recurrence-free survival (8.1 months vs 23.7 months, P=0.047, log rank test) and overall survival (11 months vs 29.2 months; P=0.003, log rank test). The latter was also the case when only stage IV tumours were analysed (P=0.0055, log rank test). These data indicate that in HNSCC, TP53 DNA contact mutations confer a strong selection pressure to eliminate wild-type alleles, and that they result in an accelerated tumour progression and reduced therapeutic responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2030736250,"Alternative splicing of cyclin D1 gene mRNA has recently been demonstrated. The novel transcript shows no splicing at the downstream exon 4 boundary and encodes a protein with an altered carboxyl-terminal domain that is a cyclin D1 variant; exon 5 is not included in the coding sequence which terminates downstream of exon 4. We here produced cells that exogenously express each form of cyclin D1 and analysed their cell cycle regulation. We found that (1) alternative splicing forms of cyclin D1 modulated entry into the cell cycle in an inverse manner; (2) both splicing forms suppressed cell growth; and (3) cells overexpressing form [a] were inhibited from entry into and completion of the S phase, although form [b]-expressing cells showed no reduction of G1- to S transition. We also found that overexpression of either cyclin D1 form upregulated Rb gene products, suggesting that this upregulation may be one of the causes of growth suppression in cyclin D1 overexpressing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1973408906,Adenylyl cyclase (AC) modulation of vesicular cycling was visualized at cultured cerebellar granule cell synapses using the sequential uptake of antibodies directed against the intraluminal domain of synaptotagmin I. Vesicle recycling due to spontaneous transmitter release in the absence of action potentials was increased by the AC/protein kinase A (PKA) activators forskolin and CPT–cAMP. These effects were blocked by the PKA inhibitor Rp–cAMPs. Cyclic AMP elevation also induced new cycling at previously silent sites. Activation of L-AP4–sensitive mGluR reduced the cAMP/PKA enhancement at preexisting synapses downstream of both AC and calcium channels. Modulation of the turnover and the number of vesicular release sites provide one mechanism that may underlie cAMP-dependent cerebellar long-term potentiation.

This angle, although greater than the 60° required for completely efficient percolation, is considerably less than the angles observed in mineral matrices at upper mantle pressure-temperature conditions in experiments. In other words, molten iron alloy can flow much more easily in lower mantle mineralogies than in upper mantle mineralogies. Accordingly, although segregation of core material by melt percolation is probably not feasible in the upper mantle, core formation by percolation may be possible in the lower mantle."

https://openalex.org/W2315918202,"Phorbol ester treatment of MCF-7 cells led to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PKC δ. However, through Western blot analysis and in vitro immunecomplex kinase assays, we detected a differential localization of tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ and catalytically active PKC δ. Catalytically active PKC δ was concentrated in Triton X-100 solubilized-membrane fractions while tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ was localized to the cytosol fraction. Phorbol ester treatment of MCF-7 cells stimulated both the time-dependent in vivo association of Src with PKC δ, evidenced in Src immunoprecipitates by the co-immunoprecipitation of PKC δ, and activation of Src, evidenced in Src immunoprecipitates as an increase in reactivity with a Src antibody (clone 28) reactive only with active Src (de-phosphorylated on residue 530) and in Src and PKC δ immunoprecipitates by an increase in Src kinase activity. While our data are consistent with reports in the literature showing the activator/stimulus-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ, our data show that the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ is not essential for kinase activity. These results are the first to demonstrate an in vivo association between PKC δ and active Src in the absence of over-expression of either PKC δ or Src, and support the association of Src and PKC δ towards a physiological function."

However, the role of PKC activation or depletion in the inhibition of melanogenesis by TPA remains controversial. In this report, using specific PKC inhibitors, we demonstrated that PKC inhibition does not impair cAMP-induced melanin synthesis and tyrosinase expression. Further, the inhibition of melanogenesis by TPA results from a decrease of the tyrosinase promoter transcriptional activity and this effect is mimicked by over-expression of a constitutively active form of PKC α. These findings clearly demonstrate that PKC activation accounts for the inhibition of melanin synthesis by TPA. Additional experiments were undertaken to elucidate the mechanism by which TPA inhibits the tyrosinase gene transcription. Deletions and mutation in the tyrosinase promoter showed that TPA acts on a M-box which is involved in tissue-specific expression and regulation by cAMP of the tyrosinase gene. We showed that TPA decreases the binding of microphthalmia, a basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor, to the M-box. Since microphthalmia, strongly stimulates the transcriptional activity of the promoter we propose that TPA, through PKC activation, decreases microphthalmia binding to the M-box of the tyrosinase promoter, thereby leading to a reduced tyrosinase expression and melanogenesis inhibition."

The float remained entrained in the plume for 60 days, and the plume vorticity was calculated directly from the anticyclonic motion of the float. Concentrations of suspended particles, particulate iron, and dissolved manganese in the plume did not decay significantly during the 60 days, which indicates that event plumes would be easily detectable a year after formation."

Since the brain and midgut of the silkmoth embryo contain PER-positive cells, we examined the circadian clock potential of these embryonic tissues. Transplantation experiments indicate that the circadian clock controlling egg-hatching behavior resides in brain, and that a humoral factor mediates this circadian regulation. We also used ligation experiments on first instar larvae to show that the circadian control of PER movement into the nuclei of midgut epithelial cells is dependent on an intact (connected) brain. These results implicate a novel brain factor in the circadian regulation of egg-hatching behavior and provide further evidence for differing mechanisms of PER control among species."

https://openalex.org/W2072471750,"The majority of human anogenital carcinomas show evidence of papillomavirus infection. To facilitate viral replication, viruses disable key cellular responses which would otherwise precipitate cell suicide. An obligate factor in one such response is the p53 tumour suppressor protein. p53 gene mutation is an infrequent event in anogenital cancer, apparently due to the action of HPV E6 protein, which inhibits wild-type p53 function by stimulating the degradation of p53 protein. p53 is required for the apoptotic response that is triggered in untransformed cells following inappropriate cell-cycling. E6 directed inhibition of p53 function thus facilitates the survival of transformed cells. We have developed a genetically tractable model that reports E6 protein-mediated human p53 inactivation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Functional dissection of the requirements for E6 directed inhibition in this system reveal an absolute requirement for the presence of both E6 protein and the human E3 ubiquitin ligase, E6-AP. Using a defined set of E6 mutants we show that degradation of p53 protein rather than E6/p53 association is likely required for E6-mediated inhibition. This S. pombe based system represents a candidate screen for novel antiviral agents that act by disrupting the E6/E6-AP/p53 interaction."
