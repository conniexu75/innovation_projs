Antibody decay stabilized between 6 and 9 months, and antibody quality continued to improve for at least 9 months after 2-dose vaccination. Spike- and RBD-specific memory B cells remained durable over time, and 40%–50% of RBD-specific memory B cells simultaneously bound the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants. Omicron-binding memory B cells were efficiently reactivated by a 3rd dose of wild-type vaccine and correlated with the corresponding increase in neutralizing antibody titers. In contrast, pre-3rd dose antibody titers inversely correlated with the fold-change of antibody boosting, suggesting that high levels of circulating antibodies may limit the added protection afforded by repeat short interval boosting. These data provide insight into the quantity and quality of mRNA-vaccine-induced immunity over time through 3 or more antigen exposures.

SARS-CoV-2 infections continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide (Carvalho et al., 2021Carvalho T. Krammer F. Iwasaki A. The first 12 months of COVID-19: a timeline of immunological insights.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; 21: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Since the virus was identified in late 2019, several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) have emerged. Mutations found in SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly those in the spike glycoprotein, can alter viral transmission and immune recognition (Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021Garcia-Beltran W.F. Lam E.C.

Of these VOC, the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant had considerable impact due to its increased infectivity and partial escape from neutralizing antibodies (Mlcochova et al., 2021Mlcochova P. Kemp S.A.

Puech J. et al.Reduced sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 variant Delta to antibody neutralization.Nature. 2021; 596: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). In November 2021, scientists in South Africa identified and characterized the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant (Viana et al., 2022Viana R. Moyo S. Amoako D.G. Tegally H. Scheepers C. Althaus C.L. Anyaneji U.J. Bester P.A. Boni M.F. Chand M. et al.Rapid epidemic expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in southern Africa.Nature. 2022; 603: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In the weeks following identification, Omicron spread rapidly, outcompeting Delta to become the dominant variant in the United States and many parts of the world. A major concern about Omicron is the large number of mutations in the spike protein, including ∼15 amino acid changes in the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). In vitro data indicate that these mutations have a substantial effect on evading antibody responses in convalescent or mRNA-vaccinated (Pfizer BNT162b2 or Moderna mRNA-1273) individuals. This effect is more pronounced than that of other VOC, with a ∼10-fold to ∼40-fold reduction in neutralization capacity compared with wild-type virus using either pseudovirus or live virus neutralization assays, and little-to-no neutralizing activity against Omicron detected at >6 months after the primary 2-dose vaccine series (Cameroni et al., 2022Cameroni E.

In addition to circulating antibodies, memory B cells represent an important source of long-term immunity (Sette and Crotty, 2021Sette A. Crotty S.

Germinal centers.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30: 429-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). In contrast to antibodies that decline over the first 3–6 months postvaccination (Levin et al., 2021Levin E.G. Lustig Y. Cohen C. Fluss R. Indenbaum V. Amit S. Doolman R. Asraf K. Mendelson E. Ziv A. et al.Waning immune humoral response to BNT162b2 Covid-19 vaccine over 6 months.N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 385: e84Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), antigen-specific memory B cells appear highly stable over time (Goel et al., 2021aGoel R.R. Painter M.M. Apostolidis S.A. Mathew D. Meng W. Rosenfeld A.M. Lundgreen K.A. Reynaldi A. Khoury D.S. Pattekar A. et al.mRNA vaccines induce durable immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern.Science. 2021; 374: abm0829Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Upon re-exposure to antigen, either through vaccination or infection, these memory B cells can differentiate into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and rapidly produce new antibodies (Laidlaw and Ellebedy, 2021Laidlaw B.J. Ellebedy A.H. The germinal centre B cell response to SARS-CoV-2.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; 22: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent non-human primate studies of mRNA vaccination highlight recall antibody responses from memory B cells as a key factor in protection from severe COVID-19 pathology in the lungs (Gagne et al., 2022aGagne M. Corbett K.S. Flynn B.J. Foulds K.E. Wagner D.A. Andrew S.F. Todd J.M. Honeycutt C.C. McCormick L.

Previous work has shown that mRNA vaccines induce robust memory B cell responses that continue to evolve via germinal center reactions for months after primary vaccination (Goel et al., 2021bGoel R.R.

As a result, immunization with mRNA vaccines encoding the original Wuhan spike protein generates a population of high-affinity memory B cells that can bind the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants and produce neutralizing antibodies upon restimulation. Serologic data indicate that antibody responses to Omicron can be at least partially boosted in the short term (up to ∼1 month) after a 3rd vaccine dose (Muecksch et al., 2022Muecksch F. Wang Z.

A 3rd vaccine dose also provides increased protection from Omicron variant infection (Shrestha et al., 2022Shrestha N.K. Shrestha P. Burke P.C. Nowacki A.S. Terpeluk P. Gordon S.M. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine boosting in persons already protected by natural or vaccine-induced immunity.J. Neurol. Sci. 2022; 428: 117607Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how long these boosted antibody responses to Omicron may last and what percent of memory B cells retain binding to Omicron and other variants. Moreover, the dynamics of memory B cell responses in humans are poorly understood, and whether boosting with the original Wuhan spike can overcome antigenic changes by efficiently reactivating Omicron-binding memory B cells is unknown (Kotaki et al., 2022Kotaki R. Adachi Y. Moriyama S. Onodera T. Fukushi S. Nagakura T. Tonouchi K. Terahara K. Sun L. Takano T. et al.SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-neutralizing memory B-cells are elicited by two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.Sci.

Zhu Q. et al.Memory B cell repertoire from triple vaccinees against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants.Nature. 2022; 603: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Finally, it remains unclear what features of immunity induced by 2-dose vaccination determine optimal boosting following a 3rd vaccine dose, and how immune responses are affected by additional antigen encounters beyond a 3-dose vaccine schedule. The answers to these questions should inform how to optimize the use of additional vaccine doses for protection against Omicron and future VOC. We examined antibody and memory B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a longitudinal cohort of 61 individuals receiving mRNA vaccines (Pfizer BNT162b2 or Moderna mRNA-1273). This cohort has been previously described through 6-months post-2 doses of mRNA vaccine (Goel et al., 2021bGoel R.R. Apostolidis S.A. Painter M.M. Mathew D. Pattekar A. Kuthuru O. Gouma S. Hicks P.

Gouma S. et al.Rapid induction of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells is associated with coordinated humoral and cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination.Immunity. 2021; 54 (2133.e3–2142.e3)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A total of 45 individuals were infection naive, and 16 had recovered from a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Paired serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were collected at 10 different time points, ranging from prevaccine baseline to ∼9–10 months postprimary 2-dose vaccination, as well as prior to a 3rd vaccine dose, ∼2 weeks post-3rd dose, and ∼3 months post-3rd dose (Figure 1A). Nine individuals had a confirmed postvaccination (commonly referred to as “breakthrough”) infection during the study period and are indicated in all analyses. Additional cohort information is provided in Tables S1 and S2. As we have previously described for this cohort, 2-dose mRNA vaccination in previously uninfected individuals induced high titers of binding and neutralizing antibodies, whereas vaccination in individuals with a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (commonly referred to as “hybrid immunity”) resulted in higher antibody titers, consistent with an anamnestic response from prevaccination immunological memory (Goel et al., 2021bGoel R.R. Apostolidis S.A. Painter M.M. Mathew D. Pattekar A. Kuthuru O. Gouma S. Hicks P. Meng W. Rosenfeld A.M. et al.Distinct antibody and memory B cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 naive and recovered individuals following mRNA vaccination.Sci. Immunol. 2021; 6: eabi6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, Goel et al., 2021aGoel R.R. Painter M.M. Apostolidis S.A. Mathew D. Meng W. Rosenfeld A.M. Lundgreen K.A. Reynaldi A. Khoury D.S. Pattekar A. et al.mRNA vaccines induce durable immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern.Science. 2021; 374: abm0829Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although these previous studies documented a decline in antibodies from their peak ∼1 month postvaccination to 6 months, here we extended our analysis of this cohort to later time points. These data revealed a stabilization of antibody titers between 6 and 9 months postvaccination for both individuals with and without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, with little-to-no decrease in neutralizing antibody titers after 6 months (Figures 1B–1D). These findings are consistent with ongoing antibody production from long-lived plasma cells in the later phases of immune memory after vaccination. To evaluate the quality of antibody responses, we calculated an antibody potency index. Although antibody-mediated protection can be influenced by functions other than neutralization (Bournazos and Ravetch, 2017Bournazos S. Ravetch J.V. Fcγ receptor function and the design of vaccination strategies.Immunity. 2017; 47: 224-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar; Lu et al., 2017Lu L.L. Suscovich T.J. Fortune S.M. Alter G. Beyond binding: antibody effector functions in infectious diseases.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 18: 46-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), we defined a potency index based on the ratio of neutralization titers to the total concentration of anti-RBD-binding IgG. Antibody potency increased significantly over time after the 2nd vaccine dose, with a continued increase in potency from 6 to 9 months postvaccination in the infection-naive group as antibody concentrations began to plateau (Figure 1E). These observations suggest decay of lower quality antibody from short-lived ASCs, as well as continued emergence of postgerminal center affinity-matured plasma cells over time that produce higher quality antibody later in the response. This improvement in the quality of antibody for at least 9 months is also consistent with a recent report demonstrating the continued presence of spike-binding germinal center B cells in axillary lymph nodes at 29 weeks postvaccination (Kim et al., 2021Kim W. Zhou J.Q. Sturtz A.J. Horvath S.C. Schmitz A.J. Lei T. Kalaidina E. Thapa M. Alsoussi W.B. Haile A. et al.Germinal centre-driven maturation of B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.Preprint at bioRxiv. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.31.466651Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In addition to the primary 2-dose vaccine series, most of our cohort went on to receive a 3rd dose of mRNA vaccine. A 3rd dose of vaccine in infection-naive individuals significantly increased binding and neutralizing antibodies, with both reaching a similar level to that observed in previously infected individuals after the 2-dose vaccine series (Figures 1B–1D). A 3rd dose of mRNA vaccine in these COVID-recovered individuals (i.e., a 4th exposure) also significantly boosted antibody responses; however, the relative magnitude of this increase was less than observed in the recall response after the initial 2-dose vaccine series (Figures 1B–1D). Several individuals in this cohort also experienced breakthrough infections after 2 or 3 doses of vaccine. Although the sample size was limited (n = 3), infection following 2-dose vaccination appeared to boost antibodies to similar levels compared with previous infection with 2 doses of vaccine (Figures 1B–1D), suggesting that the total number of antigen exposures may be as important as the relative order of exposure to infection and vaccination. To quantify neutralizing capacity of vaccine-induced antibody responses against VOC, we generated pseudotyped viruses encoding the Delta and Omicron spike proteins. Consistent with previous reports, neutralizing titers against Omicron were significantly reduced relative to D614G, with ∼20% of individuals having Omicron neutralization titers below the limit of detection at ∼9 months postprimary vaccination (Figures 1F and 1G). Following a 3rd dose, neutralizing titers to Omicron increased by a median of ∼45-fold in COVID-naive individuals, with similar kinetics and magnitude of boosting as neutralizing antibodies against D614G (Figures 1F and 1G). Although neutralization against Omicron declined 2.8-fold from peak levels between 2 weeks post-3rd dose and 3 months post-3rd dose, titers remained 16-fold above pre-3rd dose baseline in COVID-naive individuals (Figure 1F), indicating that an additional vaccine dose has a lasting benefit for antibodies against Omicron. In paired comparisons for individuals, Omicron-neutralizing antibodies had a 4.8-fold lower median neutralizing titer compared with D614G at the peak response after the 3rd vaccine dose and 4.5-fold lower titer 3 months later. Despite the relative loss of neutralizing activity, peak Omicron neutralizing titers after the 3rd dose were comparable with neutralizing titers against D614G ∼1 week after the 2nd vaccine dose, where clinical efficacy has previously been defined (Figures 1F and 1G) (Khoury et al., 2021Khoury D.S. Cromer D. Reynaldi A. Schlub T.E. Wheatley A.K. Juno J.A. Subbarao K. Kent S.J. Triccas J.A. Davenport M.P. Neutralizing antibody levels are highly predictive of immune protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.Nat. Med. 2021; 27: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Moreover, Omicron neutralizing titers at 3 months post-3rd dose were higher than pre-3rd dose D614G neutralizing titers (Figures 1F and 1G). Finally, to investigate potential differences in the quality of antibody recall responses, we compared antibody potency 2 weeks after the first dose of mRNA vaccine in individuals with pre-existing immune memory from infection to antibody potency 2 weeks after a 3rd dose of mRNA vaccine in previously uninfected individuals. Previous reports have suggested that infection generates greater antibody potency and breadth than 2-dose mRNA vaccination alone (Cho et al., 2021Cho A. Muecksch F. Schaefer-Babajew D. Wang Z. Finkin S. Gaebler C. Ramos V. Cipolla M. Mendoza P. Agudelo M. et al.Anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain antibody evolution after mRNA vaccination.Nature. 2021; 600: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but little is known about the impact of a 3rd vaccine dose on antibody potency. In this cohort, antibody potency against both D614G and Omicron was slightly higher following a 3rd dose of mRNA vaccine compared with recall responses following the 1st dose in SARS-CoV-2-recovered individuals (Figures 1H and 1I), suggesting that a 3rd dose of mRNA vaccine drives antibody potency to similar levels to “hybrid immunity.” Of note, potency continued to increase in SARS-CoV-2-recovered individuals between the initial recall response to vaccine and ∼9 months postvaccination (Figures 1E, 1H, and 1I). This finding indicates that there may be ongoing evolution after a vaccine-induced recall response that can result in further improvement of antibody potency. Taken together, these data demonstrate that antibody responses, including neutralizing antibodies to Omicron, are effectively boosted by a 3rd dose of mRNA vaccine with sustained benefit at ∼3 months post-3rd dose. We next investigated B cell responses to mRNA vaccination. Antigen-specific B cell responses were quantified from bulk PBMCs by flow cytometry using fluorescently labeled SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD probes as previously described (Dan et al., 2021Dan J.M. Mateus J. Kato Y. Hastie K.M. Yu E.D. Faliti C.E. Grifoni A. Ramirez S.I. Haupt S.

Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) was used as a historical antigen for a specificity control. Plasmablasts were identified as CD20− CD38++ non-naive B cells. Memory B cells were identified as CD20+ CD38lo/int non-naive B cells. Full gating strategy is shown in Figure S1. Consistent with our plasma antibody data, re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigen, either through a 3rd mRNA vaccine dose or breakthrough infection, resulted in a significant expansion of spike-binding plasmablasts ∼1 week after antigen encounter (Figures 2A and 2B ). Overall, the rapid emergence of antibody-secreting cells following antigen re-encounter is consistent with recall from a pool of memory B cells. These data are also consistent with findings after viral challenge in SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-vaccinated monkeys, where anamnestic antibody responses from memory B cells were identified as a major protective mechanism (Gagne et al., 2022aGagne M.

Here, we extended these observations by tracking responses further into the memory phase. Spike- and RBD-specific memory B cell numbers continued to remain highly stable through at least 9 months postvaccination in both SARS-CoV-2-naive and previously infected individuals with no evidence of decline in numbers from 6 to 9 months postprimary vaccination (Figures 2C–2E). Notably, 34/35 SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals had spike- and RBD-specific memory B cell frequencies above their prevaccine baseline at the 9-month time point, highlighting the continued durability of mRNA vaccine-induced cellular immunity. Upon receipt of a 3rd mRNA vaccine dose, these memory B cells expanded in number. At ∼2 weeks postboost, there was a median of 2.2-fold increase in spike-specific and 3.6-fold increase in RBD-specific memory B cells in infection-naive individuals, with similar boosting for spike- and RBD-specific memory B cells in COVID-recovered vaccinees (Figures 2F and 2G). By 3 months post-3rd vaccine dose in infection-naive subjects, memory B cells had declined from peak levels but still remained ∼1.5-fold more abundant than before boosting (Figures 2F and 2G). A 3rd vaccination did not markedly change the isotype composition of the response from what was reported previously in this cohort after two doses, with a majority of memory B cells remaining IgG+ (Figure 2H). A 3rd dose of vaccine also induced a population of CD71+ activated B cells, consistent with reactivation of memory B cells (Figure 2I). This activation status, however, transitioned back to a resting memory (RM) phenotype by 3 months post-3rd dose (Figure 2I). Thus, memory B cells were rapidly reactivated by re-exposure to antigen, through either infection or vaccination, and this reactivation was associated with the induction of plasmablasts, numerical expansion of memory B cells, and re-establishment of B cell memory. A major question is whether vaccination with the original Wuhan spike protein induces effective immunological memory to VOC including Omicron, and if so, whether Omicron-reactive memory B cells can be efficiently boosted by subsequently revaccinating with wild-type vaccine. To investigate if mRNA vaccine-induced memory B cells were capable of recognizing the Omicron variant and determine how Omicron binding related to specificity for other VOC, we designed a modified flow cytometry panel with antigen probes for 9 SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This panel included full-length spike, N-terminal domain (NTD), S2 domain, wild-type (WT, Wuhan-Hu-1) RBD, and 4 variant RBDs (Alpha, Be"
https://openalex.org/W4229005504,"For many solid malignancies, lymph node (LN) involvement represents a harbinger of distant metastatic disease and, therefore, an important prognostic factor. Beyond its utility as a biomarker, whether and how LN metastasis plays an active role in shaping distant metastasis remains an open question. Here, we develop a syngeneic melanoma mouse model of LN metastasis to investigate how tumors spread to LNs and whether LN colonization influences metastasis to distant tissues. We show that an epigenetically instilled tumor-intrinsic interferon response program confers enhanced LN metastatic potential by enabling the evasion of NK cells and promoting LN colonization. LN metastases resist T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, induce antigen-specific regulatory T cells, and generate tumor-specific immune tolerance that subsequently facilitates distant tumor colonization. These effects extend to human cancers and other murine cancer models, implicating a conserved systemic mechanism by which malignancies spread to distant organs."
https://openalex.org/W4229016240,"Tumor evolution is driven by the progressive acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations that enable uncontrolled growth and expansion to neighboring and distal tissues. The study of phylogenetic relationships between cancer cells provides key insights into these processes. Here, we introduced an evolving lineage-tracing system with a single-cell RNA-seq readout into a mouse model of Kras;Trp53(KP)-driven lung adenocarcinoma and tracked tumor evolution from single-transformed cells to metastatic tumors at unprecedented resolution. We found that the loss of the initial, stable alveolar-type2-like state was accompanied by a transient increase in plasticity. This was followed by the adoption of distinct transcriptional programs that enable rapid expansion and, ultimately, clonal sweep of stable subclones capable of metastasizing. Finally, tumors develop through stereotypical evolutionary trajectories, and perturbing additional tumor suppressors accelerates progression by creating novel trajectories. Our study elucidates the hierarchical nature of tumor evolution and, more broadly, enables in-depth studies of tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W4229000305,"The extent to which Omicron infection1-9, with or without previous vaccination, elicits protection against the previously dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) variant is unclear. Here we measured the neutralization capacity against variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in 39 individuals in South Africa infected with the Omicron sublineage BA.1 starting at a median of 6 (interquartile range 3-9) days post symptom onset and continuing until last follow-up sample available, a median of 23 (interquartile range 19-27) days post symptoms to allow BA.1-elicited neutralizing immunity time to develop. Fifteen participants were vaccinated with Pfizer's BNT162b2 or Johnson & Johnson's Ad26.CoV2.S and had BA.1 breakthrough infections, and 24 were unvaccinated. BA.1 neutralization increased from a geometric mean 50% focus reduction neutralization test titre of 42 at enrolment to 575 at the last follow-up time point (13.6-fold) in vaccinated participants and from 46 to 272 (6.0-fold) in unvaccinated participants. Delta virus neutralization also increased, from 192 to 1,091 (5.7-fold) in vaccinated participants and from 28 to 91 (3.0-fold) in unvaccinated participants. At the last time point, unvaccinated individuals infected with BA.1 had low absolute levels of neutralization for the non-BA.1 viruses and 2.2-fold lower BA.1 neutralization, 12.0-fold lower Delta neutralization, 9.6-fold lower Beta variant neutralization, 17.9-fold lower ancestral virus neutralization and 4.8-fold lower Omicron sublineage BA.2 neutralization relative to vaccinated individuals infected with BA.1. These results indicate that hybrid immunity formed by vaccination and Omicron BA.1 infection should be protective against Delta and other variants. By contrast, infection with Omicron BA.1 alone offers limited cross-protection despite moderate enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W4229013360,"Unlike copy number variants (CNVs), inversions remain an underexplored genetic variation class. By integrating multiple genomic technologies, we discover 729 inversions in 41 human genomes. Approximately 85% of inversions <2 kbp form by twin-priming during L1 retrotransposition; 80% of the larger inversions are balanced and affect twice as many nucleotides as CNVs. Balanced inversions show an excess of common variants, and 72% are flanked by segmental duplications (SDs) or retrotransposons. Since flanking repeats promote non-allelic homologous recombination, we developed complementary approaches to identify recurrent inversion formation. We describe 40 recurrent inversions encompassing 0.6% of the genome, showing inversion rates up to 2.7 × 10−4 per locus per generation. Recurrent inversions exhibit a sex-chromosomal bias and co-localize with genomic disorder critical regions. We propose that inversion recurrence results in an elevated number of heterozygous carriers and structural SD diversity, which increases mutability in the population and predisposes specific haplotypes to disease-causing CNVs."

The generation of trophoblast organoids from naive hPSCs provides an accessible 3D model system of the developing placenta and its susceptibility to emerging pathogens. The human placenta forms a barrier between mother and fetus that nourishes the embryo through the exchange of nutrients and gases and protects the fetus from harmful assaults. Placental abnormalities in the first trimester are associated with pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, miscarriage, and fetal growth restriction (Smith, 2010Smith G.C. First-trimester determination of complications of late pregnancy.JAMA. 2010; 303: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the ability to study human placental development in utero is limited due to ethical and legal concerns, particularly at early stages. In recent years, two complementary approaches have been developed to model human placental development in vitro. The first approach is to derive 3D placental organoids from primary proliferative cells of the first-trimester placenta, which are called cytotrophoblasts (CTB) (Haider et al., 2018Haider S. Meinhardt G. Saleh L. Kunihs V. Gamperl M. Kaindl U. Ellinger A. Burkard T.R. Fiala C.

These trophoblast organoids contain CTBs that differentiate into syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs), similar to the primary villi, and secrete placental hormones. The recent derivation of human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) offers an alternative approach to model the first-trimester placenta in vitro. hTSCs are isolated from primary placenta of the first trimester or human blastocyst outgrowths and can be maintained by combining a WNT activator, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) (Okae et al., 2018Okae H.

Here, we explored whether naive and primary hTSCs have the potential to self-organize into self-renewing 3D trophoblast organoids and determined the cellular complexity of the resulting organoids by single-cell transcriptomics. Our findings indicate that, regardless of their source, hTSCs robustly generate 3D trophoblast organoids with a similar villous architecture similar to primary trophoblast organoids. These stem-cell-derived trophoblast organoids (SC-TOs) comprise five distinct subpopulations that correspond to trophoblast cell types found during early pregnancy. We also characterize X chromosome inactivation (XCI) dynamics during the generation of SC-TOs from naive hPSCs and describe approaches for their directed differentiation into invasive 3D EVT organoids. The generation of trophoblast organoids from naive hPSCs provides an accessible and patient-specific 3D model system of human placental development. In addition to mediating maternal-fetal communication, the placenta serves as an important defense against fetal viral infections. Transplacental infection of Zika virus (ZIKV) has been implicated as one of several possible mechanisms underlying ZIKV vertical transmission during the first trimester, which can result in severe congenital malformations such as microcephaly in infants (Aagaard et al., 2017Aagaard K.M.

Since the first reported case in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly become a pandemic. Although primarily associated with respiratory failure, recent studies have reported an alarming frequency of pregnancy complications in women who contracted COVID-19 (Di Mascio et al., 2020Di Mascio D.

Here, we demonstrate that early trophoblast cell types in SC-TOs are readily infected by ZIKV but display limited susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest that the first-trimester placenta may exhibit differential susceptibility to emerging pathogens and our model provides a foundation for elucidating the pathogenesis of viral infection. To explore the potential of hTSCs to self-organize into 3D organoids, we dissociated hTSCs derived from a blastocyst (BT5), primary first-trimester CTBs (CT27 and CT30), and naive hPSCs (H9 and WIBR3) into single cells and seeded them in 3D Matrigel droplets in the presence of trophoblast organoid medium (TOM) (Turco et al., 2018Turco M.Y. Gardner L. Kay R.G. Hamilton R.S. Prater M. Hollinshead M.S. McWhinnie A. Esposito L. Fernando R. Skelton H. et al.Trophoblast organoids as a model for maternal-fetal interactions during human placentation.Nature. 2018; 564: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). 3D structures developed over the course of 10–12 days that could be maintained for at least 10 passages (Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B). Although most organoids had a dense morphology (Figure 1B, red arrows), a subset formed cyst-like structures (Figure 1B, asterisks). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis confirmed the upregulation of trophoblast markers ELF5, GATA3, and TFAP2C and downregulation of naive and primed pluripotency markers in trophoblast organoids generated from naive hPSCs (Figures 1C and S1C). In addition, all stem-cell-derived trophoblast organoids (SC-TOs) showed substantial upregulation of a primate-specific microRNA (miRNA) cluster on chromosome 19 (C19MC), which exhibits placenta-specific expression (Noguer-Dance et al., 2010Noguer-Dance M. Abu-Amero S. Al-Khtib M. Lefèvre A. Coullin P. Moore G.E. Cavaillé J. The primate-specific microRNA gene cluster (C19MC) is imprinted in the placenta.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 3566-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) (Figure 1D). Interestingly, these miRNAs were already significantly induced in naive hPSCs compared with primed hPSCs, which may contribute to the trophoblast potential of naive hPSCs. Immunofluorescence (IF) analysis indicated that epithelial CTBs (marked by CDH1 and TP63) were largely confined to the periphery of the organoids, whereas multinucleated STBs were located toward the interior (Figure 1E). Furthermore, Ki67 staining demonstrated that this epithelial CTB compartment contained proliferative cells (Figures 1E and S1D). This “inside-out” architecture is reminiscent of the villous architecture described in primary trophoblast organoids derived directly from first-trimester placental tissues (Turco et al., 2018Turco M.Y. Gardner L. Kay R.G. Hamilton R.S. Prater M. Hollinshead M.S. McWhinnie A. Esposito L. Fernando R. Skelton H. et al.Trophoblast organoids as a model for maternal-fetal interactions during human placentation.Nature. 2018; 564: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Pan-trophoblast markers GATA3 and KRT7 were strongly expressed among the nuclear and cytoskeletal compartments, respectively (Figures 1E and S1D). Cyst-like structures present within the organoid culture were uniformly positive for the STB marker CGA, which encodes the alpha subunit of HCG (Figure S1E), and thus represent a subset of fully syncytialized SC-TOs. To obtain a more quantitative measurement of the distribution of key lineage markers, we performed light-sheet imaging on optically cleared SC-TOs. This analysis confirmed their predominant inside-out morphology with an outer shell of CDH1-positive cells encircling an inner syncytial compartment marked by SDC1 (Figures 1F and 1G). Quantification of the relative volumes occupied by each marker revealed a 5- to 10-fold increase in CDH1 compared with SDC1 per organoid, but no significant differences between SC-TOs obtained from naive and primary hTSCs (Figure 1H). The secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a key placental hormone, was confirmed using an over-the-counter pregnancy test and by HCG ELISA (Figures 1I and S1F). Finally, we performed flow cytometry analysis for classical HLA class I surface antigens, which are weakly expressed in human trophoblast cells but more significantly in amniotic epithelial cells (Hammer et al., 1997Hammer A. Hutter H. Blaschitz A. Mahnert W. Hartmann M. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. Dohr G. Amnion epithelial cells, in contrast to trophoblastcells, express all classical HLA class I molecules together with HLA-G.Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1997; 37: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although significant HLA-ABC expression was detected in naive and primary hTSCs, SC-TOs displayed a reduction in mean signal intensity (Figure 1J). This suggests that HLA-ABC expression is stimulated by 2D hTSC culture and that SC-TOs more faithfully recapitulate the HLA expression profile of human trophoblast cells in vivo. Taken together, these data demonstrate that all examined hTSC lines harbor the potential for self-organization into 3D SC-TOs with comparable gross morphological structure, placental hormone secretion, and capacity for long-term self-renewal. We examined the cellular composition of SC-TOs generated from naive and primary hTSCs by single-cell transcriptome analysis. Organoids obtained from naive hTSCs (H9) and primary hTSCs (CT30) were dissociated into single cells, and cDNA libraries were generated for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using the 10x Genomics platform. Dimensional reduction analysis by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) revealed a very similar cellular composition in SC-TOs generated from naive and primary hTSCs, which was highly reproducible between two replicates (Figure 2A). Both H9 and CT30 SC-TOs comprised five discrete trophoblast subpopulations: two CTB clusters, two STB clusters, and a small EVT cluster. Pseudotime analysis revealed two distinct developmental trajectories, both of which emerged from CTB-1 (Figure 2B). One of these trajectories passes from CTB-1 directly into STB-1 and subsequently into STB-2, whereas the other trajectory proceeds via CTB-2 into EVT. This analysis suggests that trophoblast progenitors within CTB-1 bifurcate into either an EVT or STB trajectory. The CTB clusters were marked by elevated expression of genes such as CDH1, ITGA6, TEAD4, and VGLL1 (Figures 2C and 2D), the STB clusters were marked by high expression of CGA, CGB1-8, GCM1, ERVW-1, and SDC1 (Figures 2C and 2E), and the EVT cluster exhibited elevated expression of HLAG, ITGA2, and Notch1 (Figures 2C and 2F; Table S1). However, the absence of mature EVT markers such as ITGA1 and retention of epithelial surface markers CDH1 and ITGB4 in this cluster (Figures 2C and 2D) suggest that these cells have not yet completed differentiation into fully invasive EVTs. We, therefore, refer to this cluster as primitive EVTs. Differential gene expression analysis between matched clusters in H9 and CT30 organoids revealed few significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (Figure S2A; Table S2), although the overall proportion of STBs was slightly increased in H9 SC-TOs (Figure S2B). Hence, SC-TOs generated from naive and primary hTSCs display a similar cellular composition at the single-cell level. To further define the identity of these distinct trophoblast subpopulations, we analyzed DEGs between the two CTB subpopulations (CTB-1 versus CTB-2). Volcano plot analysis indicated that the CTB-1 cluster was enriched in cell-cycle-related genes, such as MKI67, CDK1, CCNA2, and CDC20 (Figure S2C; Table S1). By analyzing genes associated with distinct stages of the cell cycle, we found that CTB-1 was specifically enriched in transcripts related to G2/M phases (Figure S2D). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis based on DEGs in Table S1 further corroborated that the CTB-1 cluster was enriched in mitotic processes, whereas CTB-2 displayed a metabolic shift toward oxidative phosphorylation (Figure S3A). These findings suggest that the CTB-1 cluster represents proliferative CTBs, whereas CTB-2 contains trophoblast progenitors that have exited the cell cycle and are transitioning toward a more specialized fate. In contrast, GO analysis on the primitive EVT cluster showed upregulation of pathways involved in ECM organization, migration, immune cell interaction, and oxygen sensing, all of which are central processes for EVT function (Figure S3A). We also analyzed DEGs between the two STB subpopulations (STB-1 versus STB-2). STB-2 showed the strongest induction of pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) family genes, genes encoding the alpha and beta subunits of hCG (CGA, CGB3, CGB5, CGB7, and CGB8), and leptin (LEP) (Figure S2C; Table S1). Furthermore, all cells in this cluster had exited the cell cycle, whereas a fraction of STB-1 cells still resided in G2/M phases (Figure S2D). STB-1 was enriched in expression of GCM1, ERVFRD-1, and OVOL1, which have been implicated in regulating the fusion of CTB progenitors into STBs (Anson-Cartwright et al., 2000Anson-Cartwright L. Dawson K. Holmyard D. Fisher S.J. Lazzarini R.A. Cross J.C. The glial cells missing-1 protein is essential for branching morphogenesis in the chorioallantoic placenta.Nat.

We surmise that STB-1 represents a transitional population of CTBs that are fusing into STBs, which was also suggested by the pseudotime analysis (Figure 2B), whereas STB-2 represents more differentiated STBs. Naive hPSCs are known to undergo erasure of parent-specific imprinting marks as a consequence of global DNA demethylation (Pastor et al., 2016Pastor W.A. Chen D. Liu W. Kim R. Sahakyan A.

However, a recent study reported that hTSCs derived from naive hPSCs displayed only modest differences in expression of placenta-specific imprinted genes (Cinkornpumin et al., 2020Cinkornpumin J.K. Kwon S.Y. Guo Y. Hossain I. Sirois J. Russett C.S. Tseng H.W. Okae H. Arima T.

To corroborate these findings in our organoid model, we compared the expression of imprinted genes at the single-cell level in SC-TOs generated from naive and primary hTSCs (Figure 2G). Overall, the two SC-TO lines exhibited highly correlated expression of placenta-specific imprinted genes with the notable exceptions of PHLDA2 and ZFAT. Interestingly, failure to activate ZFAT during hTSC derivation from naive hPSCs was also noted by Pastor and colleagues (Cinkornpumin et al., 2020Cinkornpumin J.K. Kwon S.Y. Guo Y. Hossain I. Sirois J. Russett C.S. Tseng H.W. Okae H. Arima T.

We conclude that placenta-specific imprinted genes are largely expressed at appropriate levels during the generation of SC-TOs from naive hPSCs. We evaluated the transcriptional correspondence between SC-TOs and discrete stages of human trophoblast development in vivo. The organoid clusters were well-aligned with CTB, EVT, and STB identities in 3D human embryos cultured through implantation stages (Xiang et al., 2020Xiang L. Yin Y. Zheng Y. Ma Y. Li Y. Zhao Z.

When segregated by developmental time points, STBs at embryonic days (E)7–12 were more closely aligned with STB-1, whereas STBs at E13.5–14 instead clustered with the mature STB-2 subpopulation (Figure 2I). The primitive EVT cluster was aligned with EVTs at E13.5-14, whereas both CTB clusters correlated with CTBs at E7–12 (Figure 2I). We also examined whether SC-TOs may correspond transcriptionally to trophoblast identities at later stages of human placental development (Liu et al., 2018Liu Y. Fan X. Wang R. Lu X. Dang Y.L.

Proliferative CTBs isolated at 8 weeks of human placental development (CTB_8W_3) were aligned with CTB-1, whereas post-mitotic CTBs (CTB_8W_2) overlapped with CTB-2 (Figures 2J and 2K).

https://openalex.org/W4229012524,"Adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays a critical role in memory and emotion processing, and this process is dynamically regulated by neural circuit activity. However, it remains unknown whether manipulation of neural circuit activity can achieve sufficient neurogenic effects to modulate behavior. Here we report that chronic patterned optogenetic stimulation of supramammillary nucleus (SuM) neurons in the mouse hypothalamus robustly promotes neurogenesis at multiple stages, leading to increased production of neural stem cells and behaviorally relevant adult-born neurons (ABNs) with enhanced maturity. Functionally, selective manipulation of the activity of these SuM-promoted ABNs modulates memory retrieval and anxiety-like behaviors. Furthermore, we show that SuM neurons are highly responsive to environmental novelty (EN) and are required for EN-induced enhancement of neurogenesis. Moreover, SuM is required for ABN activity-dependent behavioral modulation under a novel environment. Our study identifies a key hypothalamic circuit that couples novelty signals to the production and maturation of ABNs, and highlights the activity-dependent contribution of circuit-modified ABNs in behavioral regulation. Li et al. report a key brain region in the hypothalamus that effectively modulates the production and properties of new neurons generated in adulthood. These hypothalamic modified new neurons are critical for memory and anxiety-like behavior."

Despite rich knowledge in retinal circuits, the long-range connectivity map from distinct retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types to diverse brain neuron types remains unknown. In this study, we developed an integrated approach, called Trans-Seq, to map RGCs to superior collicular (SC) circuits. Trans-Seq combines a fluorescent anterograde trans-synaptic tracer, consisting of codon-optimized wheat germ agglutinin fused to mCherry, with single-cell RNA sequencing. We used Trans-Seq to classify SC neuron types innervated by genetically defined RGC types and predicted a neuronal pair from αRGCs to Nephronectin-positive wide-field neurons (NPWFs). We validated this connection using genetic labeling, electrophysiology and retrograde tracing. We then used transcriptomic data from Trans-Seq to identify Nephronectin as a determinant for selective synaptic choice from αRGC to NPWFs via binding to Integrin α8β1. The Trans-Seq approach can be broadly applied for post-synaptic circuit discovery from genetically defined pre-synaptic neurons."

Because movement is rarely executed as intended without online adjustments (Shadmehr et al., 2010Shadmehr R. Smith M.A. Krakauer J.W. Error correction, sensory prediction, and adaptation in motor control.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 33: 89-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), the internal context defined by signals associated with behavioral goals and the current body state, here defined as “motor context,” is critical for high-performance movement control. Motor context emerges from diverse streams of information across different timescales; however, how the central nervous system signals it to flexibly recruit circuits for online movement adjustments remains poorly understood (Figure 1A). The emergence of an internal motor context likely depends on recurrent interactions between brain premotor centers and the spinal cord across different timescales (Figure 1A). Coupling of ascending signals in the mammalian brain to individual strides suggests that supraspinal circuits receive immediate information about the walking state (Orlovsky et al., 1999Orlovsky G.N. Deliagina T.G. Grillner S. Neuronal Control of Locomotion: From Mollusk to Man. Oxford University Press, 1999Crossref Google Scholar). However, the exact nature and function of these modulations remains unknown, partly due to the highly distributed structure of mammalian brain premotor circuits and to the limited understanding of how activity within these circuits contributes to walking. The compact central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster provides a powerful model in which to study the mechanisms and timescales through which motor context emerges and impacts neural activity and walking control. Importantly, and in contrast to internal physiological states, signals related to the state of the body can be directly measured by quantitative analysis of behavior and neural physiology, thus allowing to dissect the nature of motor context and its effect on motor control. In insects, the posterior slope (PS, Figure 1B), a premotor region with strong multisensory convergence (Strausfeld and Bacon, 1983Strausfeld N.J. Bacon J.P. Multimodal convergence in the central nervous system of dipterous insects.Fortschr. Zool. 1983; 28: 47-76Google Scholar), provides output to several types of descending neurons (DNs) involved in steering (Namiki and Kanzaki, 2016Namiki S. Kanzaki R.

D’Alessandro I. Li A. Vanderbeck Q. Haber I. Gibb P. Wilson R. Neural circuit mechanisms for steering control in walking Drosophila.BioRxiv. 2020; : 1-50Google Scholar). The PS receives inputs from higher-order centers, such as the lateral accessory lobe (LAL), from the ventral nerve cord (VNC, the insect analog of the spinal cord) via ascending neurons (ANs), and from visual pathways, including the lobula plate (LP) (Figure 1B) (Namiki and Kanzaki, 2016Namiki S.

Therefore, neurons projecting to PS are likely involved in brain-body interactions for context-dependent motor control, but their activity has not been characterized at multiple timescales in relation to the task at play, behavioral goals, or the body state. One class of such premotor neurons projecting to the PS is the population of horizontal system (HS) cells in the LP, visual motion sensitive neurons that are well poised to detect head and body yaw rotations (Hausen, 1984Hausen K.

Consistent with their proposed role on course and gaze stabilization, the activity of HS cells is suppressed in anticipation to voluntary rapid turns (Fenk et al., 2021Fenk L.M. Kim A.J. Maimon G.

Rapid turns are only one of many maneuvers the fly executes while walking. More recently, we found that in the context of slower rotations during forward walking, HS cells respond to the direction of the angular velocity (Va) of the fly (Fujiwara et al., 2017Fujiwara T. Cruz T.L. Bohnslav J.P. Chiappe M.E. A faithful internal representation of walking movements in the Drosophila visual system.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and integrate this extra-retinal information with visual motion signals to faithfully estimate body rotations (Figure 1B). Moreover, unilateral activation of HS cells promotes ipsilateral steering (Busch et al., 2018Busch C. Borst A. Mauss A.S.

Biol. 2018; 28: 4037-4045.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar; Fujiwara et al., 2017Fujiwara T. Cruz T.L. Bohnslav J.P. Chiappe M.E.

Joesch M. Borst A. Mauss A.S. Optogenetic control of fly optomotor responses.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 13927-13934Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting a direct contribution to course control. However, at which timescales and in which motor contexts activity in HS cells is recruited for course control has not been explored yet. Interestingly, HS cell activity also correlates with the fly’s forward velocity (Vf) (Fujiwara et al., 2017Fujiwara T. Cruz T.L. Bohnslav J.P. Chiappe M.E. A faithful internal representation of walking movements in the Drosophila visual system.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but the function of this signal has remained unclear (Figure 1B). One possibility is that the speed-related signal provides information about motor context, either related to the behavioral goals of the fly (“run forward”) or to the current state of the body (“walking at high speed”), or both. We therefore propose that this visuomotor circuit is very well suited to study the nature of motor context and its effect on neural activity and behavior. Here, we combine whole-cell patch recordings in walking flies with optogenetics and targeted suppression of chemical synapses to examine the emergence of motor context and its role on the mapping between neural activity dynamics and specific aspects of walking control. We show that a single source, the stride, operating at multiple timescales provides an elegant solution to flexibly engage a functional network in online movement adjustments within a continuous behavior that is rarely in steady state. These findings represent a general mechanism by which bidirectional interactions between the peripheral nervous system and brain visual circuits contribute to an adaptive and high-performance control of locomotion. HS cells are thought to contribute to course control when the fly actively maintains the direction of locomotion during walking at high speed (Figure 1B). If a Vf-related signal in HS cells functions as a motor context modulation, two properties should be observed. First, the selectivity of HS cells should not change with Vf. Second, manipulating HS-cell activity should lead to steering in a Vf-dependent manner. To test the first prediction, we examined the extra-retinal direction-selective properties of HS cells at different Vf by performing the whole-cell recordings of flies walking in darkness. We excluded visual stimulation in these experiments, since its presence influences the walking speed of the fly (Creamer et al., 2018Creamer M.S. Mano O. Clark D.A. Visual control of walking speed in drosophila.Neuron. 2018; 100 (1460.e6–1473.e6)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The activity of HS cells was selective to the fly’s direction of rotations independent of Vf, but the cells were more depolarized under high versus low Vf (Figure 1C). Thus, Vf modulates the activity of HS cells without changing their tuning. To test the second prediction, a Vf-dependent effect of the activity of HS cells on their behaviors, we leveraged previous work showing that unilateral activation induces ipsiversive rotations (Busch et al., 2018Busch C. Borst A. Mauss A.S. Bi-directional control of walking behavior by horizontal optic flow sensors.Curr. Biol. 2018; 28: 4037-4045.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar; Fujiwara et al., 2017Fujiwara T. Cruz T.L. Bohnslav J.P. Chiappe M.E. A faithful internal representation of walking movements in the Drosophila visual system.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and reasoned that the opposite, unilateral silencing, should induce a contraversive rotation. To induce unilateral silencing, we expressed the histamine-gated chloride channel ort (Liu and Wilson, 2013Liu W.W. Wilson R.I. Transient and specific inactivation of Drosophila neurons in vivo using a native ligand-gated ion channel.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 1202-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in HS cells and locally applied histamine at the right-side axon terminals in the PS, contingent on Vf (Figure 1D). Histamine application led to a prominent inhibition in right HS cells both at high and low Vf. However, in 9 out of 11 flies, the inhibition of HS cells led to an overt contraversive rotation only when flies walked at high Vf (Figure 1E). Importantly, the perturbation in neural activity and the effect on behavior was observed exclusively in experimental and not in control flies, in which HS cells did not exogenously express Ort (Figures 1F and S1A). Thus, these results cannot be explained by endogenous histamine receptor activity within the PS. Finally, the effect on behavior was not induced by inhibiting other neurons also labeled in the transgenic line (Figures S1B and S1C). We conclude that the Vf-related modulation in HS cells represents a motor context that flexibly recruits the neurons’ activity to steering adjustments. In a continuous behavior such as walking, Vf can fluctuate at different timescales, reflecting either slow (over seconds) changes in motor programs or behavioral goals or faster fluctuations (at a stride timescale) in reactive forces due to inevitable perturbations (Figure 1A) (Chun et al., 2021Chun C.

Mann R.S. Quantification of gait parameters in freely walking wild type and sensory deprived Drosophila melanogaster.eLife. 2013; 2: e00231PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if HS cells are recruited for rapid steering adjustments, their activity should not only be modulated over seconds, reflecting the overall state of Vf, but also at timescales of a stride. When the fly occasionally maintained a stable heading with high Vf and low Va during spontaneous walking (Figures 2A and 2B , gray shadow), the activity of HS cells mapped onto these virtual straight paths revealed fast periodic oscillations (Figure 2C). This observation suggested the presence of a fast modulation by Vf, an idea we tested by calculating the coherence between neural activity dynamics (Vm) and Vf or Va, a measure of power transfer between signals. At high-speed walking frequencies on the ball, with a period of about 160 ms (>5 Hz), the coherence was dominated by Vf, while at lower frequencies (<5 Hz) it was dominated by Va (Figure 2D). These results show that Vf-related signals are present in the activity dynamics of HS cells at both a stride timescale (>5 Hz) and over seconds (Figure 1). Because spontaneous walking on the ball is variable, we developed an optogenetics-based paradigm to promote high-speed walking (Figures 2E and 2F). We expressed the light-gated cation channel CsChrimson in interneurons promoting forward runs, the bolt protocerebral neurons (BPNs, Figure 2E) (Bidaye et al., 2020Bidaye S.S. Laturney M. Chang A.K.

Two brain pathways initiate distinct forward walking programs in drosophila.Neuron. 2020; 108 (469.e8–485.e8)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To prevent any visual response that might confound the Vf-related modulation, we used blind flies (Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G. Pak W.L. Isolation of a putative phospholipase C gene of Drosophila, norpA, and its role in phototransduction.Cell. 1988; 54: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). BPN activation induced high-speed walking with low Va (absolute mean ± SEM = 73.6 ± 3.0°/s, n = 19 flies). We will refer to this induced walking as “opto-runs.” Similar to that in spontaneous walking, during opto-runs HS-cell activity co-varied at high frequencies (5–10 Hz) with Vf and at low frequencies with Va. In addition, Va displayed a high-frequency (5–10 Hz) component (Figure 2G), which we will revisit later (Figure 5). Under visual feedback, opto-runs displayed lower course variability relative to darkness in flies with normal sight (Figure S2A), suggesting that these high-speed runs reflect an (induced) intention to walk straight (Cruz et al., 2021Cruz T.L. Malagón Pérez S. Chiappe M.E. Fast tuning of posture control by visual feedback underlies gaze stabilization in walking Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2021; 31 (4596.e5–4607.e5)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Therefore, unexpected deviations from a stable course should recruit activity in steering-control networks, including HS cells. Together, these observations show that the opto-run paradigm is suitable to examine the interaction between activity in HS cells and strides during high-speed walking. The correlation between Vm and Vf at high frequencies suggests that HS cells are modulated at stride timescale. To determine the relationship between the stride cycle and activity in HS cells, we tracked the three legs from the left side (Mathis et al., 2018Mathis A. Mamidanna P. Cury K.M. Abe T. Murthy V.N. Mathis M.W. Bethge M. DeepLabCut: markerless pose estimation of user-defined body parts with deep learning.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar) and recorded in simultaneous the membrane potential of HS cells (Vm), Vf and Va during opto-runs (Figures 3A, S2B, and S2C; Video S1). Vm was strongly coupled to the stride cycle (Figures 3B, S2D, and S2E), with a peak-to-trough amplitude ranging from 2 to 6 mV, which was never observed in quiescence (Figure 3C). Hereafter, to analyze the phase relation between the oscillatory dynamics in HS cells, Vf, and the stride cycle, we used Vm|5 Hz, the high-frequency component of Vm (Figure 2; see STAR Methods). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/221e5fa8-c2d6-49d3-91c9-aa19542b0b79/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

Tracking of leg joints during opto-runs, related to Figures 3 and S2Example video showing the labels used to track two joints from the fly’s three legs of the left side. Color code indicates different labels: orange, hindleg femur-tibia joint; red, hindleg tibia-tarsus joint; light-green, middle leg femur-tibia joint; yellow, middle leg tibia-tarsus joint; dark-blue, foreleg femur-tibia joint; light-blue, foreleg tibia-tarsus joint. Vm|5 Hz oscillations were also observed in spontaneous walking under visual feedback (Figure 3D), and both in spontaneous- and opto-runs, each leg displayed a specific phase relation with Vm|5 Hz, which depended on the neural recording side (Figures 3D–3F and S2D–S2F). For example, the early stance phase of the left front leg coincided with the peak of the right side and the trough of the left side HS cells’ oscillations (Figures 3D–3F). The phase relation of the front versus middle legs with the contralateral Vm|5 Hz was shifted by about 120° (Figure 3E), consistent with a tetrapod-like gait configuration (DeAngelis et al., 2019DeAngelis B.D. Zavatone-Veth J.A. Clark D.A. The manifold structure of limb coordination in walking Drosophila.eLife. 2019; 8: 1-34Crossref Google Scholar; Mendes et al., 2013Mendes C.S. Bartos I. Akay T. Márka S.

The hind leg movement was less correlated to Vm|5 Hz (Figures 3E and S2G–S2I) and therefore was not the focus of further analysis. Altogether, these observations revealed a fixed relation between a specific leg’s stride cycle and the contralateral Vm|5 Hz, and an antiphase relation between the activity of left and right HS cells. The oscillations in Vm|5 Hz could originate from a mechanical coupling between forces exerted by legs and brain motion, or as a direct consequence of BPN activation. To address the first possibility, we recorded the activity in the vertical system (VS) cells, which reside close by HS cells but display no modulation by Vf (Fujiwara et al., 2017Fujiwara T. Cruz T.L. Bohnslav J.P. Chiappe M.E. A faithful internal representation of walking movements in the Drosophila visual system.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We found that their activity was not coupled to the stride cycle (Figures S2J–S2L). To test whether activation of BPNs directly induces oscillations in HS cells, we momentarily decoupled BPN activity from walking by stopping the airflow of the ball while activating BPNs. Stopping the ball induced uncoordinated leg movements, which were revealed by a decrease in the periodicity of the autocorrelation of the leg signal (“leg motion coupling,” Figure S3). When walking was interrupted, Vm oscillations (for comparison, measured as the autocorrelation of the Vm signal, “Vm coupling”) decreased (Figure S3B). Overall, Vm coupling was strongly correlated with leg motion coupling (Figures S3A–S3C), indicating that activity of BPNs or postsynaptic neurons per se was not driving the rhythmic neural activity. Rather, the oscillations in HS cells may reflect leg kinematic parameters, such as joint positions. Indeed, HS cells were more depolarized when the femur-tibia or tibia-tarsus joint position at stance onset was more anterior (Figures S3D and S3E). These results suggest that oscillations in HS cells originate from periodic leg movements. A stride consists of sequential left and right steps typically coordinated in antiphase (DeAngelis et al., 2019DeAngelis B.D. Zavatone-Veth J.A. Clark D.A. The manifold structure of limb coordination in walking Drosophila.eLife. 2019; 8: 1-34Crossref Google Scholar; Mendes et al., 2013Mendes C.S. Bartos I. Akay T. Márka S. Mann R.S.

Dübbert M. Scholz H. Büschges A. Inter-leg coordination in the control of walking speed in Drosophila.J. Exp. Biol. 2013; 216: 480-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). When the fly walks straight, the left-right pair contributes equally to acceleration, thus creating two peaks in Vf during the stride cycle (Figure S4A). In contrast, HS-cell activity displayed only a single peak per stride (Figure S4A), suggesting that one leg predominantly modulates their activity. To evaluate which leg (i.e., left versus right) is the major contributor, we focused on front legs since they modulated HS cells stronger than the middle legs (Figures S4B and S4C). When the fly drifted from a straight course, the relation between the stride cycle and Vf was single peaked. The peak of Vf occurred at the stance phase of the side dominating the acceleration and driving angular drifts (Figure S4D) and coincided with the peak of Vm|5 Hz only when the contralateral front leg dominated the acceleration (e.g., during contraversive rotations) (Figures S4D–S4F). Thus, the oscillations in HS cells seemed to reflect contralateral leg movement rather than fluctuations in Vf (Figure 2). Given the phase relation between Vm|5 Hz and the left front leg’s stride cycle (Figure 3F), HS cells may be hyperpolarized during the stance phase of the contralateral leg (Model 1; Figure S4G, left) or depolarized during the stance phase of the ipsilateral leg (Model 2; Figure S4G, right). Model 1 predicts that oscillations in HS cells and Vf should correlate strongly during left drifts, whereas the converse is predicted by Model 2. By design, simulations showed that either model replicated the observed phase relation between the stride cycle and Vm|5 Hz (Figure S4I; STAR Methods). However, Model 1 and not Model 2 replicated the relation between Vf and Vm|5 Hz under angular drift as observed in the data (Figures S4J and S4K). These results support a model in which a unilateral leg-related sensorimotor network configures activity in the contralateral HS cells to respond rapidly. To directly examine if neural signals from leg sensorimotor circuits contribute to the stride-coupled activity in HS cells, we perturbed chemical synaptic transmission in a large population of leg mechanosensory neurons via selective expression of tetanus toxin (Mendes et al., 2013Mendes C.S. Bartos I. Akay T. Márka S. Mann R.S. Quantification of gait parameters in freely walking wild type and sensory deprived Drosophila melanogaster.eLife. 2013; 2: e00231PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 4A). Recordings from HS cells in experimental flies during spontaneous high-speed walking (>5 mm/s) showed that the stride-coupled dynamics were largely degraded, although not fully abolished (Figures 4B and 4C). Perturbations in signal transmission within leg sensorimotor circuits can lead to deficits in leg coordination that might indirectly perturb oscillations in Vm|5 Hz (Fujiwara et al., 2017Fujiwara T.

However, adult rodents that received a complete thoracic lesion just after birth demonstrate proficient hindlimb locomotion without input from the brain. How the spinal cord achieves such striking plasticity remains unknown. In this study, we found that adult spinal cord injury prompts neurotransmitter switching of spatially defined excitatory interneurons to an inhibitory phenotype, promoting inhibition at synapses contacting motor neurons. In contrast, neonatal spinal cord injury maintains the excitatory phenotype of glutamatergic interneurons and causes synaptic sprouting to facilitate excitation. Furthermore, genetic manipulation to mimic the inhibitory phenotype observed in excitatory interneurons after adult spinal cord injury abrogates autonomous locomotor functionality in neonatally injured mice. In comparison, attenuating this inhibitory phenotype improves locomotor capacity after adult injury. Together, these data demonstrate that neurotransmitter phenotype of defined excitatory interneurons steers locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury."
https://openalex.org/W4229083617,"Renal fibrosis is the final common outcome of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which remains a huge challenge due to a lack of targeted treatment. Growing evidence suggests that during the process of CKD, the integrity and function of mitochondria in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) are generally impaired and strongly connected with the progression of renal fibrosis. Mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy, could remove aberrant mitochondria to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. Deficiency of mitophagy has been reported to aggravate renal fibrosis. However, whether induction of mitophagy could alleviate renal fibrosis has not been stated. In this study, we explored the effect of mitophagy activation by UMI-77, a compound recently verified to induce mitophagy, on murine CKD model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in vivo and TECs in vitro. In UUO mice, we found the changes of mitochondrial damage, ROS production, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/Smad pathway activation, as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype and renal fibrosis, and these changes were ameliorated by mitophagy enhancement using UMI-77. Moreover, TEC apoptosis, nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling activation, and interstitial inflammation after UUO were significantly mitigated by augmented mitophagy. Then, we found UMI-77 could effectively and safely induce mitophagy in TECs in vitro, and reduced TGF-β1/Smad signaling and downstream profibrotic responses in TGF-β1-treated TECs. These changes were restored by a mitophagy inhibitor. In conclusion, we demonstrated that mitophagy activation protected against renal fibrosis through improving mitochondrial fitness, downregulating TGF-β1/Smad signaling and alleviating TEC injuries and inflammatory infiltration in kidneys."
https://openalex.org/W4229052975,"Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are responsible for the production of blood and immune cells. Throughout life, HSPCs acquire oncogenic aberrations that can cause hematological cancers. Although molecular programs maintaining stem cell integrity have been identified, safety mechanisms eliminating malignant HSPCs from the stem cell pool remain poorly characterized. Here, we show that HSPCs constitutively present antigens via major histocompatibility complex class II. The presentation of immunogenic antigens, as occurring during malignant transformation, triggers bidirectional interactions between HSPCs and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, causing stem cell proliferation, differentiation, and specific exhaustion of aberrant HSPCs. This immunosurveillance mechanism effectively eliminates transformed HSPCs from the hematopoietic system, thereby preventing leukemia onset. Together, our data reveal a bidirectional interaction between HSPCs and CD4+ T cells, demonstrating that HSPCs are not only passive receivers of immunological signals but also actively engage in adaptive immune responses to safeguard the integrity of the stem cell pool."

However, the cystic organoids lack the branching morphology of intrahepatic bile ducts (IHBDs). Here, we report establishing human branching cholangiocyte organoid (BRCO) cultures. BRCOs self-organize into complex tubular structures resembling the IHBD architecture. Single-cell transcriptomics and functional analysis showed high similarity to primary cholangiocytes, and importantly, the branching growth mimics aspects of tubular development and is dependent on JAG1/NOTCH2 signaling. When applied to cholangiocarcinoma tumor organoids, the morphology changes to an in vitro morphology like primary tumors. Moreover, these branching cholangiocarcinoma organoids (BRCCAOs) better match the transcriptomic profile of primary tumors and showed increased chemoresistance to gemcitabine and cisplatin. In conclusion, BRCOs recapitulate a complex process of branching morphogenesis in vitro. This provides an improved model to study tubular formation, bile duct functionality, and associated biliary diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4229058922,"Tau assembly movement from the extracellular to intracellular space may underlie transcellular propagation of neurodegenerative tauopathies. This begins with tau binding to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which triggers macropinocytosis. Pathological tau assemblies are proposed then to exit the vesicular compartment as “seeds” for replication in the cytoplasm. Tau uptake is highly efficient, but only ∼1 to 10% of cells that endocytose aggregates exhibit seeding. Consequently, we studied fluorescently tagged full-length (FL) tau fibrils added to native U2OS cells or “biosensor” cells expressing FL tau or repeat domain. FL tau fibrils bound tubulin. Seeds triggered its aggregation in multiple locations simultaneously in the cytoplasm, generally independent of visible exogenous aggregates. Most exogenous tau trafficked to the lysosome, but fluorescence imaging revealed a small percentage that steadily accumulated in the cytosol. Intracellular expression of Gal3-mRuby, which binds intravesicular galactosides and forms puncta upon vesicle rupture, revealed no evidence of vesicle damage following tau exposure, and most seeded cells had no evidence of endolysosome rupture. However, live-cell imaging indicated that cells with pre-existing Gal3-positive puncta were seeded at a slightly higher rate than the general population, suggesting a potential predisposing role for vesicle instability. Clearance of tau seeds occurred rapidly in both vesicular and cytosolic fractions. The lysosome/autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin inhibited vesicular clearance, whereas the proteasome inhibitor MG132 inhibited cytosolic clearance. Tau seeds that enter the cell thus have at least two fates: lysosomal clearance that degrades most tau, and entry into the cytosol, where seeds amplify, and are cleared by the proteasome.

Multiple lines of experimental evidence suggest that tau protein triggers neurodegeneration after intracellular accumulation in ordered assemblies. Myriad tauopathies are linked to distinct assembly structures and include Alzheimer’s disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, among many others (1Lee V.M.-Y. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Neurodegenerative tauopathies.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). The transcellular propagation and faithful replication of unique assembly structures, or “strains,” appears to underlie the characteristic progression patterns of specific tauopathies (2Vaquer-Alicea J. Diamond M.I. Propagation of protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2019; 88: 785-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Tau propagation presumably involves three steps: uptake of an assembly into the cell; amplification and maintenance of the aggregated state; and exit from the cell. We originally observed that tau binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface underlies uptake via macropinocytosis, and is mediated by specific heparan sulfate proteoglycans sulfation patterns (3Holmes B.B. DeVos S.L. Kfoury N. Li M. Jacks R. Yanamandra K. et al.Heparan sulfate proteoglycans mediate internalization and propagation of specific proteopathic seeds.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After uptake into macropinosomes, an assembly must make contact with endogenous tau in the cytoplasm to serve as a template and amplify a specific structure. Several reports suggest that this might happen after vesicle rupture (5Chen J.J. Nathaniel D.L. Raghavan P. Nelson M. Tian R.

Finally, when tau seeds enter the cytoplasm, it is unknown how they are degraded. In this study, we used cultured cells to dynamically visualize tau uptake and seeding, to track the relationship of seeding to vesicle processing and rupture, and to determine mechanisms of seed degradation in the vesicular versus cytoplasmic compartments. Wildtype full-length (FL) tau undergoes seeded aggregation inefficiently in cultured cells, and thus, we studied FL (2N4R) tau containing a disease-associated P301S mutation, fused to mClover3 (FL tau-Clo) (Fig. 1A). We stably expressed FL tau-Clo in U2OS cells, where it colocalized with tubulin (Fig. 1B). We then directly imaged U2OS biosensor cells that were exposed to exogenous FL wildtype (2N4R) tau fibrils covalently labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647), tracking FL tau-Clo puncta formation over time. Similar to our original observations (7Frost B. Jacks R.L. Diamond M.I. Propagation of tau misfolding from the outside to the inside of a cell.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12845-12852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), a minority of cells exhibited induced aggregation of tau, which predominated in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C). Time-lapse imaging (IN Cell Analyzer 6000, GE) also revealed intracellular aggregation in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D), and in imaging dynamic inclusion formation in ∼50 cells, we often observed aggregates forming simultaneously throughout the cytoplasm (Movie S1). For nascent intracellular aggregates, we observed no significant colocalization with AF647-labeled exogenous tau. This raised the question of how tau seeds traffic into the cytoplasm. To study the fate of internalized tau, we exposed U2OS to FL tau fibrils labeled with AF647, imaging them repeatedly over 2 days with high-content microscopy. We first tested for colocalization with vesicles by stably expressing mRuby3 fusions to Rab5 (to mark early endosomes, Figs. 1A and 2A), Rab7 (to mark late endosomes, Figs. 1A and 2B), and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) (to mark lysosomes, Figs. 1A and 2C). Tau progressively colocalized with these markers, especially LAMP1. We concluded that most internalized tau entered the endolysosomal pathway. When we tracked seeding in U2OS biosensor cells expressing FL tau-Clo using LAMP1, we observed no significant colocalization of emergent tau puncta with the lysosome, which was largely in a separate compartment versus the induced FL-tau-Clo aggregates (Fig. 3A). FL tau seeding is inefficient enough to make capture of large numbers of seeding events relatively difficult. We therefore performed the same experiment using repeat domain tau-Clo containing a P301S mutation (RD tau-Clo) to image a high number of seeded cells (Fig. 3B). Similar to our observation with FL tau, we observed no significant colocalization between RD tau-Clo aggregates and LAMP1 (Fig. 3C). Thus, although most internalized tau wound up in the lysosome, this seemed unlikely to be the primary location of seeding.Figure 3Tau inclusion formation is independent of the lysosome. A, U2OS cells expressing FL tau-Clo and LAMP1-Rub were treated with exogenous fibrils. Cells were observed over time for coincidence of LAMP1-Rub signal and FL tau-Clo inclusion formation.

After exposing U2OS cells to FL tau fibrils labeled with AF647, we detected diffuse fluorescence in the cytoplasm at 20 h (Fig. 4A). We next used live-cell imaging to monitor hundreds of cells exposed to FL tau fibrils tagged with AF647. We observed a small but steady increase of cytosolic AF647 signal, whereas transferrin-AF647 did not increase in signal following a similar exposure protocol (Fig. 4B). To test our observations by a different approach, we used cell fractionation based on differential centrifugation to measure tau seed levels in cytosol versus organelle (vesicle) fractions (Fig. 4C). We confirmed the accuracy of the fractionations using Western blot against GAPDH (cytosol), voltage-dependent anion channel (organelle), LAMP1 (organelle), and lamin B1 (nucleus) (Fig. 4D). We attempted to quantify tau protein levels via Western blot, ELISA, and mass spectrometry, but they were too low for reliable measurements. We next monitored seeding activity in the cytoplasm by transducing lysate into a well-characterized biosensor assay based on a next-generation cell line, v2L (8Holmes B.B. Furman J.L. Mahan T.E. Yamasaki T.R. Mirbaha H. Eades W.C. et al.Proteopathic tau seeding predicts tauopathy in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We observed a steady increase in cytosol seeding activity over time (Fig. 4E). Tau seeds thus steadily moved from vesicles to the cytosol. Prior studies have proposed that tau-mediated damage to vesicles might allow leakage into the cytoplasm to initiate seeding (6Calafate S. Flavin W. Verstreken P. Moechars D.

To test this hypothesis, we expressed the galectin-3 β-galactoside–binding protein fused to mRuby3 (Gal3-Rub), to observe the relationship of vesicle rupture and tau seeding. β-galactosides localize to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane and are present in the lumen of endocytic vesicles. Gal3-Rub expressed intracellularly is normally diffusely distributed. However, if an endosome is damaged, Gal3-Rub binds β-galactosides, creating puncta (11Paz I. Sachse M. Dupont N. Mounier J.

Microglial lectins in health and neurological diseases.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2018; 11: 158Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We stably expressed Gal3-Rub in U2OS cells and tracked puncta formation using high-content microscopy. Gal3-Rub diffusely distributed in most cells (Fig. 5A). Following exposure of cells to FL tau fibrils tagged with AF647, we observed tau in every cell. However, we observed no change in Gal3-Rub puncta formation (Fig. 5A). This was confirmed by quantitation of hundreds of cells (Fig. 5B). We contrasted this with l-leucyl-l-leucine O-methyl ester (LLOMe; Cayman Chemical) treatment to disrupt vesicles, which strongly induced Gal3-Rub puncta formation (Fig. 5B). In summary, we observed no detectable change in overall vesicle permeability upon tau exposure, suggesting that tau fibrils do not significantly damage endocytic vesicles. We used live-cell imaging to track seeding into cells using expression of FL tau-Clo as a biosensor. We observed seeding into cells with and without coincident Gal3-Rub–positive puncta (Fig. 6, A and B). Seeding efficiency onto FL tau is relatively low; so to more easily quantify Gal3-Rub puncta in relation to seeding events, we used the RD tau-clo biosensor. This enabled recording of hundreds of seeding events. We began by observing in an endpoint assay that ∼12% of untreated cells exhibited Gal3-Rub puncta (Fig. 6C). By contrast, ∼35% of cells with seeding exhibited coincident Gal3-Rub puncta, whereas ∼65% did not (Fig. 6C). The higher association of Gal3-Rub puncta with seeded cells led us to test the relationship more rigorously. We used dynamic imaging of cells in culture to identify those that developed tau inclusions after exogenous seeding. We then tracked the cells backward ∼12 h prior to the appearance of tau inclusions to determine the percentage that showed no Gal3-Rub puncta at any time (82%), transient Gal3-Rub puncta (2%), or pre-existing puncta (16%) (Fig. 6D). The large majority of seeded cells did not show any prior evidence of vesicle rupture. The number with pre-existing evidence of vesicle instability (18% total) was slightly higher than the total we observed in untreated cells (12%). To directly compare the seeding efficiency after direct rupture of vesicles, we tested the effect of vesicle rupture by LLOMe versus seed transduction via Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). We observed a modest increase in seeding after LLOMe treatment (from ∼1% to ∼5%); however, Lipofectamine treatment, which presumably delivers aggregates directly to the cytoplasm, increased seeding to ∼32% (Fig. 6E). We concluded that while vesicle integrity may influence the frequency of seeding events, this is not the primary determinant. Our observations were consistent with escape of tau seeds from the vesicular compartment to the cytosol, where seeding occurs. The persistence of tau in each compartment would thus determine the relative efficiency of seeding. Consequently, we evaluated the kinetics of tau seed clearance using purification of seeds from each fraction, coupled with detection using standard v2L biosensor cells (9Hitt B.D. Vaquer-Alicea J. Manon V.A. Beaver J.D. Kashmer O.M. Garcia J.N. et al.Ultrasensitive tau biosensor cells detect no seeding in Alzheimer’s disease CSF.Acta Neuropathol. Commun. 2021; 9: 99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We exposed U2OS cells to recombinant FL tau fibrils, followed by fractionation of cells into organelle (vesicle) versus cytosol fractions. We used immunoprecipitation to test for seeding within the organelle fraction (to avoid toxicity on biosensor cells) and directly assayed the cytosol fraction. In the organelle fraction, tau had virtually disappeared by 12 h (Fig. 7A). In the cytosol fraction, clearance was slightly slower, with tau seeding detectable even at 48 h (Fig. 7B). We attempted to use ELISA and mass spectrometry to monitor tau clearance directly, but levels were too low for accurate measurement without using inordinately large amounts of recombinant tau in cultured cells. We next tested the effect of inhibitors of the lysosome/autophagy (bafilomycin Sigma–Aldrich) and proteasome (MG132, Sigma-Aldrich) on seed clearance over 4 h, a maximum time point picked to minimize secondary effects. Bafilomycin halted degradation in the organelle fraction (Fig. 7C) but had no effect on the cytosol fraction (Fig. 7D). By contrast, MG132 had no effect on organelle clearance (Fig. 7E) but prevented clearance of tau seeds from the cytosol (Fig. 7F). We observed a rapid seed clearance in the organelle fraction. In the cytosol, there appeared to be a rapid clearance with t1/2 of ∼4 h and a slower phase of 12 to 24 h. Taken together, the data suggested two paths of seed clearance for tau: in the vesicle, seeds are degraded via the lysosome, whereas in the cytoplasm, seeds are cleared rapidly via the proteasome. It is unknown how a tau assembly propagates a unique structure from the outside to the inside of a cell. This study has investigated the trafficking kinetics of tau seeds into the cytosol and mechanisms of degradation. For ease of labeling and tracking, we used recombinant heparin-induced FL tau fibrils, which undoubtedly lack the same seed conformation that occurs in AD, or post-translational modifications. Second, rather than primary neurons, which might more accurately reflect disease processes, we used an immortalized cell line, U2OS, because it is highly adherent, has a large cell body, and is useful for live-cell imaging over days. We observed that most tau taken up by the cell traffics to the endolysosomal system, where it is degraded fairly rapidly. A small percentage of assemblies entered the cytosol to seed intracellular aggregation, which appeared to occur often simultaneously at multiple sites. Seeding increased after experimental rupture of endosomes; however, this did not appear to be the predominant mechanism, and tau assemblies did not measurably disrupt vesicles. Most assemblies appeared to be degraded via bafilomycin-sensitive mechanisms in the lysosome, whereas cytosolic seeds were degraded primarily by the proteasome. In summary, our data indicate two major routes into the cell for a tau seed: one into the lysosomal degradation pathway, and the other to the cytosol, where recruitment of native tau and template-based replication occur (Fig. 8). In cultured cells, despite widespread tau uptake by macropinocytosis, seeding is relatively inefficient. To overcome this problem in experimental systems, we (8Holmes B.B. Furman J.L. Mahan T.E. Yamasaki T.R. Mirbaha H. Eades W.C. et al.Proteopathic tau seeding predicts tauopathy in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: E4376-E4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and others (13Guo J.L. Lee V.M.-Y. Seeding of normal tau by pathological tau conformers drives pathogenesis of Alzheimer-like tangles.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 15317-15331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) have used lipid-based transduction reagents to improve cytoplasmic delivery of tau assemblies. In biosensor cells expressing FL tau-Clo, we observed seeding in ~1% of exposed cells, despite ∼100% of the cells taking up labeled tau assemblies into the endolysosomal system. We expressed FL tau-Clo constructs that bind the cytoplasmic tubulin network. Within hours after tau seed exposure, however, we observed simultaneous evolution of tau puncta throughout the cytoplasm. The simultaneous appearance of puncta within the cell suggests that there may be a regulatory pathway controlling this process. In data not presented, we tested for a role for the cell cycle but did not observe any. We have concluded that seeds not visible by microscopy escaped the endolysosomal compartment to recruit endogenous FL tau-Clo away from the tubulin network. Taken together, our results imply that, following macropinocytosis, only a small subset of tau assemblies wind up in the cytosol, where they serve as templates for amplification. Prior studies have suggested that tau enters the cytosol by rupturing vesicles (6Calafate S. Flavin W. Verstreken P. Moechars D. Loss of Bin1 promotes the propagation of tau pathology.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 931-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 10Falcon B. Noad J. McMahon H. Randow F. Goedert M. Galectin-8–mediated selective autophagy protects against seeded tau aggregation.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 2438-2451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, using formation of Gal3-Rub puncta as a marker of vesicle integrity, we found no evidence that tau aggregates directly induce rupture. Neither did we observe FL tau-Clo puncta formation in close proximity to Gal3-stained vesicles. Finally, based on live-cell imaging of hundreds of cells, in the majority of cases (∼65–80%), we observed no evidence of vesicle rupture in association with seeding events. However, when we specifically tested the relationship of Gal3-Rub puncta to subsequent cell seeding, we observed a slight increase in the percentage of cells that exhibited pre-existing evidence of Gal3-Rub binding (∼16%), relative to cells that did not have evidence of seeding (∼12% of the total overall). Notably, 82% of seeded cells showed no evidence of preceding vesicle rupture. Pre-existing vesicle instability might slightly predispose toward tau seeding, but is clearly not a major determinant. Genes associated with the endolysosomal system have been linked to AD (14Gao S. Casey A.E. Sargeant T.J. Mäkinen V.-P. Genetic variation within endolysosomal system is associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease.Brain. 2018; 141: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When we treated cells with LLOMe to rupture lysosomes following loading with tau, we only saw a ∼5× increase in seeding, from 1% to 5%. In contrast, treatment with Lipofectamine 2000 increased seeding ∼35×. This implies that the route by which tau enters the cytosol may impact its seeding efficiency and argues against simple vesicle rupture as a primary mode. The contrast of our findings to those of others (6Calafate S. Flavin W. Verstreken P. Moechars D. Loss of Bin1 promotes the propagation of tau pathology.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 931-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 10Falcon B. Noad J. McMahon H. Randow F. Goedert M. Galectin-8–mediated selective autophagy protects against seeded tau aggregation.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 2438-2451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) may reflect our use of different systems and purified recombinant tau fibrils. Importantly, a recent study using Human embryonic kidney 293 cells and primary neurons also concluded that tau does not damage vesicles (15Tuck B.J. Miller L.V.C. Wilson E.L. Katsinelos T. Cheng S. Vaysburd M. et al.Tau assemblies enter the cytosol in a cholesterol sensitive process essential to seeded aggregation.bioRxiv. 2021; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.21.449238Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We are continuing to investigate the molecular mechanism by which assemblies might cross the vesicle membrane in the absence of rupture, potentially via direct translocation. Our data suggest trafficking of tau seeds into two compartments: the endolysosome and the cytoplasm. The relative amount of tau protein in both compartments was too low to measure via Western blot, ELISA, or even mass spectrometry, but we readily quantified tau seeding activity using biosensor cells. We determined that tau seeds within the vesicle compartment are rapidly cleared. This was blocked by bafilomycin, consistent with lysosomal degradation. By contrast, seeds within the cytosol appeared to have a rapid and slow phase of degradation. The rapid phase, with a half time of ∼4 h, was blocked by proteasome inhibition with MG132. The persistence of seeds in the cytosol for up to 48 h after cell exposure suggests that a small subset may be protected from degradation, with a longer half-life. The role of autophagy in aggregate degradation has been proposed by many studies (16Nixon R.A. The role of autophagy in neurodegenerative disease.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 983-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 17Festa B.P. Barbosa A.D. Rob M. Rubinsztein D.C. The pleiotropic roles of autophagy in Alzheimer’s disease: from pathophysiology to therapy.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2021; 60: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Our data suggest a more nuanced interpretation, with the proteasome rapidly degradeing exogenous seeds that enter the cytosol. But we cannot exclude a role for autophagy for slower clearance. Since the proteasome must digest single unfolded proteins, we propose that disassembly factors could be important. One candidate is valosin-containing protein (p97/VCP), which has been directly implicated in dominantly inherited tauopathy (18Darwich N.F. Phan J.M. Kim B. Suh E. Papatriantafyllou J.D. Changolkar L. et al.Autosomal dominant VCP hypomorph mutation impairs disaggregation of PHF-tau.Science. 2020; 370eaay8826Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that two populations of intracellular tau result from macropinocytosis. Most tau enters the endolysomal system for rapid degradation, resulting in relatively inefficient seeding overall. We observed a steady increase of tau in the cytosol over time both by imaging and fractionation studies. Cytosol seeding thus appears to be derived from tau leakage out of the endolysosomal system, whether by vesicle rupture or other mechanisms such as membrane translocation (15Tuck B.J. Miller L.V.C.

Vaysburd M. et al.Tau assemblies enter the cytosol in a cholesterol sensitive process essential to seeded aggregation.bioRxiv. 2021; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.21.449238Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 19Katsinelos T.

Our conclusions that there exist two paths for tau into the cell, with one leading to intracellular seed amplification, may help clarify the molecular mechanisms of tauopathy and may explain the identification of endolysomal genes as AD risk factors (14Gao S.

Inhibitors targeting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between WDR5 and its binding partners, however, do not inhibit all of WDR5-mediated oncogenic functions and exert rather limited antitumor effects. Here, we report a cereblon (CRBN)-recruiting proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) of WDR5, MS40, which selectively degrades WDR5 and the well-established neo-substrates of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs):CRBN, the Ikaros zinc finger (IKZF) transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3. MS40-induced WDR5 degradation caused disassociation of the MLL/KMT2A complex off chromatin, resulting in decreased H3K4me2. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that targets of both WDR5 and IMiDs:CRBN were significantly repressed by treatment of MS40. In MLL-rearranged leukemias, which exhibit IKZF1 high expression and dependency, co-suppression of WDR5 and Ikaros by MS40 is superior in suppressing oncogenesis to the WDR5 PPI inhibitor, to MS40's non-PROTAC analog controls (MS40N1 and MS40N2, which do not bind CRBN and WDR5, respectively), and to a matched VHL-based WDR5 PROTAC (MS169, which degrades WDR5 but not Ikaros). MS40 suppressed the growth of primary leukemia patient cells in vitro and patient-derived xenografts in vivo. Thus, dual degradation of WDR5 and Ikaros is a promising anti-cancer strategy."

In the main body of the stomach, chief cells produce digestive enzymes; however, upon injury, they undergo rapid proliferation for prompt tissue regeneration. Here, we identified p57Kip2 (p57) as a molecular switch for the reserve stem cell state of chief cells in mice. During homeostasis, p57 is constantly expressed in chief cells but rapidly diminishes after injury, followed by robust proliferation. Both single-cell RNA sequencing and dox-induced lineage tracing confirmed the sequential loss of p57 and activation of proliferation within the chief cell lineage. In corpus organoids, p57 overexpression induced a long-term reserve stem cell state, accompanied by altered niche requirements and a mature chief cell/secretory phenotype. Following the constitutive expression of p57 in vivo, chief cells showed an impaired injury response. Thus, p57 is a gatekeeper that imposes the reserve stem cell state of chief cells in homeostasis."

One of the most common causative organisms is Streptococcus agalactiae, which is also potentially harmful to humans and aquatic animals. At present, research on S. agalactiae in China is mostly concentrated in the northern region, with limited research in the southeastern and southwestern regions. In this study, a total of 313 clinical mastitis samples from large-scale dairy farms in five regions of Sichuan were collected for isolation of S. agalactiae. The epidemiological distribution of S. agalactiae was inferred by serotyping isolates with multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Susceptibility testing and drug resistance genes were detected to guide the clinical use of antibiotics. Virulence genes were also detected to deduce the pathogenicity of S. agalactiae in Sichuan Province. One hundred and five strains of S. agalactiae (33.6%) were isolated according to phenotypic features, biochemical characteristics, and 16S rRNA sequencing. Serotype multiplex polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that all isolates were of type Ia. The isolates were up to 100% sensitive to aminoglycosides (kanamycin, gentamicin, neomycin, and tobramycin), and the resistance rate to β-lactams (penicillin, amoxicillin, ceftazidime, and piperacillin) was up to 98.1%. The TEM gene (β-lactam-resistant) was detected in all isolates, which was in accordance with a drug-resistant phenotype. Analysis of virulence genes showed that all isolates harbored the cfb, cylE, fbsA, fbsB, hylB, and α-enolase genes and none harbored bac or lmb. These data could aid in the prevention and control of mastitis and improve our understanding of epidemiological trends in dairy cows infected with S. agalactiae in Sichuan Province."

The genetic blockage of this lineage increased the intestinal stem cell pool while decreasing epithelial and immune maturation at weaning age, leading to reduced postnatal growth and dysregulated repair responses. Ablating PDGFRα in the LTBR stromal lineage demonstrates that PDGFRα has a major impact on the lineage fate and function, inducing a transcriptomic switch from prostemness genes, such as Rspo3 and Grem1, to prodifferentiation factors, including BMPs, retinoic acid, and laminins, and on spatial organization within the crypt-villus and repair responses.

In this study, we investigated the effect of L. plantarum J-15 on kidney stone formation in renal calcium oxalate (CaOx) rats induced by ethylene glycol and monitored the changes of intestinal microflora and their metabolites detected by 16S rRNA sequencing and widely targeted analysis, followed by the evaluation of the intestinal barrier function and inflammation levels in the colon, blood and kidney. The results showed that L. plantarum J-15 effectively reduced renal crystallization and urinary oxalic acid. Ten microbial genera, including anti-inflammatory and SCFAs-related Faecalibaculum, were enriched in the J-15 treatment group. There are 136 metabolites from 11 categories significantly different in the J-15 supplementation group compared with CaOx model rats, most of which were enriched in the amino acid metabolic and secondary bile acid pathways. The expression of intestinal tight junction protein Occludin and the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandin were decreased in the intestine, which further reduced the translocated lipopolysaccharide and inflammation levels in the blood upon J-15 treatment. Thus, the inflammation and injury in the kidney might be alleviated by downregulating TLR4/NF-κB/COX-2 signaling pathway.

The functions of FSTL1 have been studied in heart and lung injury as well as in wound healing; however, the role of FSTL1 in the kidney is largely unknown. Here, we show using single-cell RNA-Seq that Fstl1 was enriched in stromal cells in obstructed mouse kidneys. In addition, immunofluorescence demonstrated that FSTL1 expression was induced in fibroblasts during kidney fibrogenesis in mice and human patients. We demonstrate that FSTL1 overexpression increased renal fibrosis and activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, known to promote kidney fibrosis, but not the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), Notch, Hedgehog, or Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling pathways in obstructed mouse kidneys, whereas inhibition of FSTL1 lowered Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Importantly, we show that FSTL1 interacted with Wnt ligands and the Frizzled (FZD) receptors but not the coreceptor lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). Specifically, we found FSTL1 interacted with Wnt3a through its extracellular calcium-binding (EC) domain and von Willebrand factor type C-like (VWC) domain, and with FZD4 through its EC domain. Furthermore, we show that FSTL1 increased the association of Wnt3a with FZD4 and promoted Wnt/β-catenin signaling and fibrogenesis. The EC domain interacting with both Wnt3a and FZD4 also enhanced Wnt3a signaling. Therefore, we conclude that FSTL1 is a novel extracellular enhancer of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway."

So far, only one of the E1, E2, and E3 enzymes each of the UFMylation system have been identified, and a handful of substrates have been reported. The regulatory mechanisms governing UFM1 modification of target proteins and the cellular processes controlled by UFMylation remain largely unknown. UFMylation is a reversible process because of UFSPs mediated de-UFMylation reaction (19Kang S.H. Kim G.R. Seong M. Baek S.H. Seol J.H. Bang O.S. et al.Two novel ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1)-specific proteases, UfSP1 and UfSP2.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5256-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although two UFSP genes (UFSP1 and UFSP2) are present in the human genome, it has long been believed that human UFSP1 is inactive or nonfunctional because it lacks a specific protease domain as translated from the annotated 445AUG (2Gerakis Y. Quintero M. Li H. Hetz C. The UFMylation system in proteostasis and beyond.Trends Cell Biol. 2019; 29: 974-986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Yoo H.M. Kang S.H.

Cell. 2014; 56: 261-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, UFSP2 has been regarded as the only active protease that mediates UFM1 precursor (pro-UFM1) maturation and de-UFMylation in human cells. Intriguingly, several studies have shown that KO of UFSP2 resulted in significantly increased protein UFMylation in human cells, indicating that other active UFSPs mediate pro-UFM1 maturation in human cells (13Walczak C.P. Leto D.E. Zhang L. Riepe C. Muller R.Y. DaRosa P.A. et al.Ribosomal protein RPL26 is the principal target of UFMylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A novel approach to assess the ubiquitin-fold modifier 1-system in cells.FEBS Lett. 2017; 591: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Given that only UFSP1 and UFSP2 are present in the human genome, we are naturally concerned about the true identity of UFSP1 in the UFMylation/de-UFMylation process. It has been known for decades that translation can start from codons other than AUG, usually from near-cognate initiation codons, which have a sequence that differs from the AUG codon by one nucleotide (for example, CUG, GUG, and UUG) (21Peabody D.S. Translation initiation at non-AUG triplets in mammalian cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5031-5035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kearse M.G. Wilusz J.E.

Ribosome profiling of mouse embryonic stem cells reveals the complexity and dynamics of mammalian proteomes.Cell. 2011; 147: 789-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Through sequence alignment, we identified a potential coding region of cysteine protease catalytic domain upstream of the canonical ORF in human UFSP1 gene, which may be derived from near-cognate CUG codons. In this study, we demonstrated that expression of human UFSP1 is initiated through eIF2A-mediated translational initiation, and human UFSP1 is a functional UFSP with distinguishing feature in protein UFMylation/de-UFMylation. To explore the possibility that the near-cognate start codon makes human UFSP1 acquired functional protease activity, we constructed two UFSP1 expression plasmids, one containing the canonical coding region (UFSP1-Short) and the other containing the full length of the complementary DNA (cDNA) with the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) (UFSP1-Long). The canonical coding region of human UFSP1 is expected to generate the peptide with the molecular weight (MW) approximately 17 kDa. Intriguingly, we only detected a ∼23 kDa specific protein band in UFSP1-L construct transfected cells but no expected size of ∼17 kDa protein band was detected in UFSP1-S construct–transfected cells (Fig. 1A). Similarly, we constructed GFP-tag fused UFSP1-S or UFSP1-L vectors and only detected a prominent ∼50 kDa fusion protein band (GFP-tag, ∼27 kDa) in UFSP1-L-GFP construct–transfected cells (Fig. S1A). Meanwhile, the levels of UFMylation were significantly decreased by the expression of UFSP1-L or UFSP1-L-GFP, but not by that of UFSP1-S or UFSP1-S-GFP (Figs. 1A and S1A), and this decreased UFMylation associated with UFSP1-L expression is fully abrogated by the potential active site cysteine (349TGC) to alanine (GCC) mutation (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that an upstream near-cognate codon, other than the annotated 445AUG codon, was used for human UFSP1 translation initiation and for the production of an active UFSP. During pro-UFM1 maturation, the C-terminal Ser-Cys dipeptide of pro-UFM1 (∼9.1 kDa) is cleaved by the UFSPs to expose its C-terminal conserved Gly residue (24Yoo H.M. Park J.H. Jeon Y.J. Chung C.H. Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 acts as a positive regulator of breast cancer.Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2015; 6: 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Matured UFM1 (∼8.9 kDa) is required for conjugation to its target proteins. To further confirm the functionality of human UFSP1 in pro-UFM1 maturation, we transfected a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged pro-UFM1 plasmid (pSG5-UFM1-HA) or control vector into HEK293T cells depleted UFSP1, UFSP2, or both UFSP1 and UFSP2, respectively. We found that the patterns of protein UFMylation were significantly changed with distinctive features in UFSP1, UFSP2, or double KO cells (Figs. 1C and S1B). UFSP2 KO resulted in considerably increased levels of protein UFMylation in cells (Fig. 1C, lines 3 and 7). In addition, the levels of protein UFMylation in UFSP1 KO cells were slightly increased or comparable to those in the parental cells (Fig. 1C, lines 2 and 6). However, UFMylation was completely blocked in UFSP1/UFSP2 double KO cells (Fig. 1C, lines 4 and 8). These results further demonstrate that human UFSP1 is an active UFSP with distinguished specificity in protein UFMylation/de-UFMylation; and UFSP1 and UFSP2 are the only UFSPs in human cells. In eukaryotic cells, CUG initiation codon is the most common among the various near-cognate codons identified (23Ingolia N.T. Lareau L.F. Weissman J.S. Ribosome profiling of mouse embryonic stem cells reveals the complexity and dynamics of mammalian proteomes.Cell. 2011; 147: 789-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 25Lee S. Liu B. Lee S. Huang S.-X. Shen B. Qian S.-B. Global mapping of translation initiation sites in mammalian cells at single-nucleotide resolution.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: E2424-E2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). We evaluated the 5′ UTR sequence of human UFSP1 mRNA for translation start site and found a total of seven CUG codons in-frame coding region containing the upstream catalytic domain. According to the MW, we have narrowed down the list to four candidate CUG codons, 190CUG, 217CUG, 226CUG, and 247CUG (Fig. 2A). To identify the true initiation site, we created a set of mutations on each of these four CUG codons (as CTG in plasmids) individually to determine which is required for human UFSP1 expression. Mutations at 217CTG fully abrogate UFSP1 expression, whereas mutations at 190CTG, 226CTG, or 247CTG have no significant effect on UFSP1 expression (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that 217CUG codon, but not the other three near-cognate codons, is the translation initiation site of human UFSP1. In order to confirm the translation initiation site, we sought to obtain direct evidence using mass spectrometry (MS) for peptide sequencing (Fig. S2A). We generated a homozygous FLAG-tag knock-in (KI) cell line (FLAG-KI-6#) using CRISPR/Cas9 system, in which a FLAG-tag coding sequence (CDS) was inserted at the C terminus of the human UFSP1 locus (Figs. 2, C and D and S2B). The MS results of endogenous UFSP1-FLAG reveal a total of eleven peptides covering 75% of the predicted full-length human UFSP1, among them six peptides were covered more than 90% of the predicted N-terminal region (from 217CUG to the canonical 445AUG) (Fig. 2E). The MS data confirmed that 217CUG is the human UFSP1 translation start site, which encodes the amino acid methionine (Met), but not leucine (Leu). CUG normally encodes for a Leu but when used as an alternative start site, CUG can encode for Met (22Kearse M.G. Wilusz J.E. Non-AUG translation: a new start for protein synthesis in eukaryotes.Genes Dev. 2017; 31: 1717-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The MS data with exogenous C-terminal HA-tagged UFSP1 (UFSP1-HA) showed a similar result (Fig. S2C). Theoretically, all potential UFSP1 isoforms with the same FLAG-tagged or HA-tagged C terminus were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG or anti-HA affinity gel. However, our data showed that only one tagged UFSP1 band was specifically detectable with a MW corresponding to the upstream near-cognate codon 217CUG instead of annotated 445AUG (Figs. 2, D and E and S2C), suggesting that UFSP1 expressed only the full-length enzyme-active form in human cells. While human UFSP1 translationally initiated from 217CUG, we found the efficiency of exogenous expression was extremely low without the 5′ UTR sequence in the constructs. Thus, a certain 5′ UTR sequence may be required for the efficient translation of human UFSP1. The Kozak consensus sequence (RCCAUGG, where R is a purine) plays an important role in translation initiation (26Kozak M. Point mutations define a sequence flanking the AUG initiator codon that modulates translation by eukaryotic ribosomes.Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar, 27Diaz de Arce A.J. Noderer W.L. Wang C.L. Complete motif analysis of sequence requirements for translation initiation at non-AUG start codons.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 985-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In UFSP1 mRNA, we noted that 217CUG is embedded in an optimal Kozak consensus sequence (ACCGCCCUGG), whereas no such motif exists surrounding the 445AUG and other near-cognate codons (Fig. 2A). We constructed a series of UFSP1 plasmids with full-length or truncated 5′ UTR (Fig. 3A). After transfection, we found that the Kozak consensus sequence can only sustain basal UFSP1 expression, and efficient protein expression needs longer 5′ UTR sequence (Fig. 3B). We found that approximate 126 nt long sequence upstream of 217CTG is sufficient for high efficiency of human UFSP1 translation as full-length 5′ UTR (Fig. 3C). In particular, the sequence between 97 and 126 nt upstream of 217CTG seems to be required for efficient UFSP1 expression. In order to ascertain the role of 97 to 126 nt for efficient UFSP1 expression, we constructed UFSP1-L-Random expression plasmids in which the 30 nt sequence between 97 and 126 nt were substituted by a 30 nt random sequence. After transfection, we found the efficiency of human UFSP1 expression with UFSP1-L-Random plasmids was extremely low as compared to that with WT UFSP1-L or 5′ UTR-UFSP1-126 (Fig. 3D). We found that the sequence between 97 and 126 nt contains an E-box motif (CAGCTG), and the expression of human UFSP1 was significantly inhibited by the E-box deletion or mutation (Fig. S3A). These results suggest that the 97 to 126 nt sequence plays an important role in human UFSP1 expression. In addition, we observed that this 97 to 126 nt sequence inserted upstream GFP recombinant construct is able to enhance the GFP expression (Fig. S3B). These data suggest that the specific sequence in 5′ UTR is essential for human UFSP1 expression. The detailed mechanisms of non-AUG initiation are still unclear. It has been reported that eIF2A plays an important role in translational initiation at the CUG start codon, and some chemical compounds differentially regulate protein synthesis initiated at the AUG or CUG start codons (28Starck S.R. Jiang V. Pavon-Eternod M. Prasad S. McCarthy B. Pan T. et al.Leucine-tRNA initiates at CUG start codons for protein synthesis and presentation by MHC class I.Science. 2012; 336: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 29Liang H. He S. Yang J. Jia X. Wang P. Chen X. et al.PTENalpha, a PTEN isoform translated through alternative initiation, regulates mitochondrial function and energy metabolism.Cell Metab. 2014; 19: 836-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For example, acriflavine selectively inhibits CUG initiation, whereas aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) inhibits AUG initiation but enhances initiation at the CUG codon. We examined the expression levels of human UFSP1 in response to these chemical inhibitors in HEK293T and HeLa cells and found that acriflavine attenuated UFSP1 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A and B), whereas ATA increased the expression of UFSP1 (Fig. 4, C and D). Whereas the expression of UFSP2 and global UFMylation were barely changed by the treatment with ATA or were inhibited by treatment with acriflavine only at high dosage (Fig. 4, A–D). Similarly, overexpression of FLAG-eIF2A increases the level of UFSP1 in both HeLa and HEK293T cells, but no changes in UFSP2 expression and in protein UFMylation were observed (Fig. 4, E and F). Moreover, eIF2A knockdown reduced human UFSP1 expression in both in HEK293T (Fig. 4, G and H) and HeLa (Fig. 4, I and J) cells. These results suggest the indispensable role of eIF2A in CUG translation initiation of human UFSP1. To assess the function of UFSP1 in the maturation of the pro-UFM1 and de-UFMylation processes in comparison with UFSP2, we analyzed UFMylation/de-UFMylation of the known substrate activating signal cointegrator 1 (ASC-1) and showed that both human UFSP1 and UFSP2 can deconjugate the UFM1 from UFMylated ASC-1 (Fig. 5A). In addition, we purified human UFSP1 and pro-UFM1-HA from HEK293T cells and showed that human UFSP1 can cleave the pro-UFM1-HA to generate mature UFM1 in in vitro assay (Fig. 5B). We have initially attempted to purify human recombinant UFSP1 from Escherichia coli; however, human UFSP1 did not get expressed in E. coli (Fig. S4A). Using codon-optimized (CO) UFSP1-L plasmid with 217ATG initiation codon, we have successfully purified the human recombinant UFSP1 protein from E. coli (Fig. S4B) and showed that human recombinant UFSP1 exhibits high enzymatic activity in maturation of pro-UFM1 (Fig. 5C). These results provide direct evidence that human UFSP1, like UFSP2, is an active UFM1-specific protease. In addition, our results showed that human UFSP1 exhibits higher catalytic activity than UFSP2 in de-UFMylation of ASC-1, overexpression of UFSP1 mediated stronger protein de-UFMylation than overexpression of UFSP2 (Fig. 5, A and D). Both of UFSP1 and UFSP2 are widely expressed in human tissues, and UFSP1 is expressed at a very low level compared with UFSP2 (Fig. S5). Unlike predominantly ER membrane-localized UFSP2, we found that human UFSP1 is a cytosolic protein (Fig. 5E). Based on the differences of UFSP1 and UFSP2 in catalytic activity, expression levels, intracellular localization, and UFMylation pattern in UFSP1 or UFSP2 KO cells, we believe UFSP2 appears to be mainly involved in the deconjugation of UFM1, whereas UFSP1 is mainly involved in the maturation of pro-UFM1. Both of UFSP1 and UFSP2 together maintain a dynamic and reversible process of protein UFMylation/de-UFMylation in cells. In this study, we demonstrated that translation of human UFSP1 is initiated from the upstream near-cognate 217CUG codon in 5′ UTR through eIF2A-mediated translational initiation, rather than the annotated 445AUG codon, producing an active UFM1-specific protease. The approximate 126 nt long sequence upstream of 217CUG plays an important role in the efficiency of UFSP1 expression. Like UFSP2, human UFSP1 functions in both maturation of the pro-UFM1 and de-UFMylation reaction. Unlike UFSP2, human UFSP1 expresses at low level in cytosol and may have different substrate specificity. Most CUG-initiated proteins (such as PTEN, FGF2, and BiP) have the canonical AUG-initiated form besides one or two CUG-initiated forms (29Liang H. He S. Yang J. Jia X. Wang P.

Yahiro K. et al.Translation from the 5′ untranslated region shapes the integrated stress response.Science. 2016; 351aad3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), whereas human UFSP1 has only the 217CUG-initiated form (∼23 kDa), but not the 445AUG-initiated form (∼17 kDa). Even during exogenous expression, we can only detect a very small amount of 445AUG-initiated form by overexposure, which is likely caused by the ribosomal leaky scanning mechanism during protein translational initiation (32Kozak M. Adherence to the first-AUG rule when a second AUG codon follows closely upon the first.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2662-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, human UFSP1 is translated by using near-cognate codon 217CUG, rather than annotated 445AUG codon. Although a Kozak consensus sequence exits surrounding the 217CUG, efficient protein expression (UFSP1 or GFP) still needs longer 5′ UTR sequence (Figs. 3B and S3B). The sequence in 97 to 126 nt upstream of the 217CUG played a pivotal role in regulating UFSP1 expression efficiency. Previous studies showed a correlation between the efficiency of mRNA translation and secondary structure stability of local mRNA sequence near the initiation codon (33Kudla G. Murray A.W. Tollervey D. Plotkin J.B. Coding-sequence determinants of gene expression in Escherichia coli.Science. 2009; 324: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 34Kochetov A.V. Palyanov A.

AUG_hairpin: prediction of a downstream secondary structure influencing the recognition of a translation start site.BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that 5′ UTR sequence of human UFSP1 forms secondary structures (such as hairpin loops, bulges, and internal loops) necessary for the efficiency of translation initiation of UFSP1. eIF2A plays an important role in translational initiation at non-AUG start codon. Like other CUG-initiated proteins, the translation initiation of human UFSP1 is mediated by eIF2A. Given that phosphorylation of eIF2α leads to a general inhibition of translation, and eIF2A is increased during multiple stress conditions (31Starck S.R. Tsai J.C. Chen K. Shodiya M. Wang L. Yahiro K. et al.Translation from the 5′ untranslated region shapes the integrated stress response.Science. 2016; 351aad3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), suggesting non-AUG translation is a common stress response mechanism. Although the detailed molecular mechanism remains unclear, UFMylation is closely related to ER homeostasis (8Tatsumi K. Yamamoto-Mukai H. Shimizu R. Waguri S. Sou Y.-S.

Therefore, we propose that eIF2A mediated 217CUG initiation of human UFSP1 expression (as well as UFSP1 in other primates) may provide a specific regulatory mechanism in ER homeostasis regulation. Furthermore, sequence alignment showed that the Cys protease domain of UFSP1 is conserved among organisms from fruit flies to humans (Fig. S6A). However, the CUG translation initiation mechanism of UFSP1 only exists in primates but not in other mammals (Fig. S6B and Table S2), suggesting that specific regulatory mechanism is restricted to primates. Unlike the human UFSP1, mouse UFSP1 has a canonical AUG start site upstream of Cys protease domain coding region and expressed as an active UFM1-specific protease with ∼23 kDa (19Kang S.H. Kim G.R.

https://openalex.org/W4225371831,"G protein-sensitive inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels are important pharmaceutical targets for neuronal, cardiac, and endocrine diseases. Although a number of GIRK channel modulators have been discovered in recent years, most lack selectivity. GIRK channels function as either homomeric (i.e., GIRK2 and GIRK4) or heteromeric (e.g., GIRK1/2, GIRK1/4, and GIRK2/3) tetramers. Activators, such as ML297, ivermectin, and GAT1508, have been shown to activate heteromeric GIRK1/2 channels better than GIRK1/4 channels with varying degrees of selectivity but not homomeric GIRK2 and GIRK4 channels. In addition, VU0529331 was discovered as the first homomeric GIRK channel activator, but it shows weak selectivity for GIRK2 over GIRK4 (or G4) homomeric channels. Here, we report the first highly selective small-molecule activator targeting GIRK4 homomeric channels, 3hi2one-G4 (3-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-oxoethyl]-3-hydroxy-1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one). We show that 3hi2one-G4 does not activate GIRK2, GIRK1/2, or GIRK1/4 channels. Using molecular modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology, we analyzed the binding site of 3hi2one-G4 formed by the transmembrane 1, transmembrane 2, and slide helix regions of the GIRK4 channel, near the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding site, and show that it causes channel activation by strengthening channel-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate interactions. We also identify slide helix residue L77 in GIRK4, corresponding to residue I82 in GIRK2, as a major determinant of isoform-specific selectivity. We propose that 3hi2one-G4 could serve as a useful pharmaceutical probe in studying GIRK4 channel function and may also be pursued in drug optimization studies to tackle GIRK4-related diseases such as primary aldosteronism and late-onset obesity."
https://openalex.org/W4229067800,"We make complex decisions using both fast judgments and slower, more deliberative reasoning. For example, during value-based decision-making, animals make rapid value-guided orienting eye movements after stimulus presentation that bias the upcoming decision. The neural mechanisms underlying these processes remain unclear. To address this, we recorded from the caudate nucleus and orbitofrontal cortex while animals made value-guided decisions. Using population-level decoding, we found a rapid, phasic signal in caudate that predicted the choice response and closely aligned with animals' initial orienting eye movements. In contrast, the dynamics in orbitofrontal cortex were more consistent with a deliberative system serially representing the value of each available option. The phasic caudate value signal and the deliberative orbitofrontal value signal were largely independent from each other, consistent with value-guided orienting and value-guided decision-making being independent processes."

Eventually, the microarray dataset (GSE28166) was analyzed to validate the altered expression level of target genes and found the genes involved in protein binding and adaptive immune responses. This study presents novel miRNAs and their targeted genes, which upon experimental validation could facilitate in developing new therapeutics against H5N1V infection."
https://openalex.org/W4229000854,"Jumonji domain-containing 3 (JMJD3/KDM6B) is a histone demethylase that plays an important role in regulating development, differentiation, immunity, and tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms responsible for the epigenetic regulation of inflammation during mastitis remain incompletely understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of JMJD3 in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mastitis model. GSK-J1, a small molecule inhibitor of JMJD3, was applied to treat LPS-induced mastitis in mice and in mouse mammary epithelial cells in vivo and in vitro. Breast tissues were then collected for histopathology and protein/gene expression examination, and mouse mammary epithelial cells were used to investigate the mechanism of regulation of the inflammatory response. We found that the JMJD3 gene and protein expression were upregulated in injured mammary glands during mastitis. Unexpectedly, we also found JMJD3 inhibition by GSK-J1 significantly alleviated the severity of inflammation in LPS-induced mastitis. These results are in agreement with the finding that GSK-J1 treatment led to the recruitment of histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), an inhibitory chromatin mark, in vitro. Furthermore, mechanistic investigation suggested that GSK-J1 treatment directly interfered with the transcription of inflammatory-related genes by H3K27me3 modification of their promoters. Meanwhile, we also demonstrated that JMJD3 depletion or inhibition by GSK-J1 decreased the expression of toll-like receptor 4 and negated downstream NF-κB proinflammatory signaling and subsequently reduced LPS-stimulated upregulation of Tnfa, Il1b, and Il6. Together, we propose that targeting JMJD3 has therapeutic potential for the treatment of inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4229371797,"Histone H4 lysine 20 monomethylation (H4K20me1) plays a crucial role in multiple processes including DNA damage repair, DNA replication, and cell cycle control. Histone methyltransferase SET8 (previously named PR-Set7/KMT5A) mediates the chromatin deposition of H4K20me1, but how SET8 recognizes and modifies H4 in the context of the nucleosome is not fully understood. Here, we developed a simple chemical modification approach for H4K20 substitution by using the lysine analog S-ethyl-L-cysteine (Ecx). Substitution of H4K20 with H4Ecx20 improves the stability of the SET8-nucleosome complex, allowing us to determine the cryo-EM structure at 3.2 Å resolution. Structural analyses show that SET8 directly interacts with the H4 tail and the H2A-H2B acidic patch to ensure nucleosome binding. SET8 residues R339, K341, K351 make contact with nucleosomal DNA at the super helical location 2 (SHL2). Substitution of SET8 DNA-binding residues with alanines decreases the SET8-nucleosome interaction and impairs the methyltransferase activity. Disrupting the binding between SET8 R192 and H2A-H2B acidic patch decreases the cellular level of H4K20me1. Together, these results reveal a near-atomic resolution structure of SET8-bound nucleosome and provide insights into the SET8-mediated H4K20 recognition and modification. The lysine-to-Ecx substitution approach can be applied to the study of other methyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W4225377331,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins play crucial roles in various enzyme activities, cell signaling and adhesion, and immune responses. While the molecular mechanism underlying GPI-anchored protein biosynthesis has been well studied, the role of zinc transport in this process has not yet been elucidated. Zn transporter (ZNT) proteins mobilize cytosolic zinc to the extracellular space and to intracellular compartments. Here, we report that the early secretory pathway ZNTs (ZNT5-ZNT6 heterodimers [ZNT5-6] and ZNT7-ZNT7 homodimers [ZNT7]), which supply zinc to the lumen of the early secretory pathway compartments are essential for GPI-anchored protein expression on the cell surface. We show, using overexpression and gene disruption/re-expression strategies in cultured human cells, that loss of ZNT5-6 and ZNT7 zinc transport functions results in significant reduction in GPI-anchored protein levels similar to that in mutant cells lacking phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis (PIG) genes. Furthermore, medaka fish with disrupted Znt5 and Znt7 genes show touch-insensitive phenotypes similar to zebrafish Pig mutants. These findings provide a previously unappreciated insight into the regulation of GPI-anchored protein expression and protein quality control in the early secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4229376410,"Myopia is increasing worldwide and its preventable measure should urgently be pursued. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been reported to have various effects such as vasodilative and anti-inflammatory, which myopia may be involved in. This study is to investigate the inhibitory effect of PUFAs on myopia progression. A lens-induced myopia (LIM) model was prepared using C57B L6/J 3-week-old mice, which were equipped with a -30 diopter lens to the right eye. Chows containing two different ratios of n-3/n-6 PUFA were administered to the mice, and myopic shifts were confirmed in choroidal thickness, refraction, and axial length in the n-3 PUFA-enriched chow group after 5 weeks. To exclude the possibility that the other ingredients in the chow may have taken the suppressive effect, fat-1 transgenic mice, which can produce n-3 PUFAs endogenously, demonstrated significant suppression of myopia. To identify what elements in n-3 PUFAs took effects on myopia suppression, enucleated eyes were used for targeted lipidomic analysis, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were characteristically distributed. Administration of EPA to the LIM model confirmed the inhibitory effect on choroidal thinning and myopia progression. Subsequently, to identify the elements and the metabolites of fatty acids effective on myopia suppression, targeted lipidomic analysis was performed and it demonstrated that metabolites of EPA were involved in myopia suppression, whereas prostaglandin E2 and 14,15-dihydrotestosterone were associated with progression of myopia. In conclusion, EPA and its metabolites are related to myopia suppression and inhibition of choroidal thinning."

Although the incidence of listeriosis is low, the fatality rate is high. Therefore, continual surveillance and rapid epidemiological investigation are crucial for addressing L. monocytogenes. Because of the popularity of next-generation sequencing, obtaining the whole-genome sequence of a bacterium is easy. Several genome-based typing methods are available, and core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) is the most recognized methods. Using cgMLST typing to compare L. monocytogenes whole-genome sequences (WGS) with those obtained across distinct regions is beneficial. However, the concern is how to incorporate the powerful cgMLST method into investigations, such as by using source tracing. Herein, we present an easy-to-use web service called-LmTraceMap (http://lmtracemap.cgu.edu.tw/hua_map/test/upload.php; http://120.126.17.192/hua_map/test/upload.php) that can help public-health professionals rapidly trace closely related isolates worldwide and visually inspect them in search results on a world map with labeled epidemiological data.

https://openalex.org/W4229083828,"Wound healing is a complex phenomenon that requires coordination of numerous molecular and cellular changes to facilitate timely and efficient repair of the damaged tissue. Although many of these molecular pathways have been detailed, others remain to be elucidated. In the present work, we show for the first time, roles for the acetyltransferase TIP60 and nuclear receptor transcription factor PXR in this process, participating in wound healing by altering actin dynamics and cellular motility. We found that in response to wound-injury, TIP60 induces rapid formation of filopodia at the wounded cell front, leading to enhanced cell migration and faster closure of the wound. Further, qPCR analysis revealed heightened expression of Cdc42 and ROCK1 genes, key regulators involved in filopodia formation and actin reorganization, exclusively in TIP60-PXR-expressing cells upon wound-induction. We also performed ChIP assays to confirm the context-specific binding of TIP60 on the ROCK1 promoter and demonstrated that the TIP60 chromodomain is essential for loading of the TIP60-PXR complex onto the chromatin. Results from immunoprecipitation assays revealed that during the wounded condition, TIP60 alters the chromatin microenvironment by specifically acetylating histones H2B and H4, thereby modulating the expression of target genes. Overall, findings of this study show that TIP60 is a novel regulator of the wound healing process by regulating the expression of wound repair-related genes."

https://openalex.org/W4229036609,"Background The China-Myanmar border area is considered a hot spot of active HIV-1 recombination in Southeast Asia. To better understand the characteristics of HIV-1 transmission in this area, a cross-sectional HIV-1 molecular epidemiological survey was conducted in Baoshan Prefecture of Yunnan Province. Methods In total, 708 newly reported HIV-1 cases in Baoshan Prefecture from 2019 to 2020 were included in this study. HIV-1 gag , pol and env genes were sequenced, and the spatial and demographic distributions of HIV-1 genotypes were analyzed. The characteristics of HIV-1 transmission were investigated using the HIV-1 molecular network method. Results In the 497 samples with genotyping results, 19 HIV-1 genotypes were found, with URFs being the predominant strains (30.2%, 150/497). The main circulating HIV-1 strains were mostly distributed in the northern area of Baoshan. URFs were more likely identified in Burmese individuals, intravenous drug users and those younger than 50 years old. CRF08_BC was more likely detected in farmers and those of Han ethnicity, CRF01_AE in the young and those of Han ethnicity, and CRF07_BC in the subpopulation with junior middle school education and higher. Moreover, CRF118_BC and CRF64_BC were more likely found in the subpopulation aged ≥40 years and ≥50 years, respectively. Among 480 individuals with pol sequence detection, 179 (37.3%) were grouped into 78 clusters, with Baoshan natives being more likely to be in the network. The proportion of the linked individuals showed significant differences when stratified by the regional origin, marital status, age and county of case reporting. In the molecular network, recent infections were more likely to occur among nonfarmers and individuals aged below 30 years. Conclusions HIV-1 genetics has become complex in Baoshan. HIV-1 molecular network analysis provided transmission characteristics in the local area, and these findings provided information to prioritize transmission-reduction interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4229065580,"Some animal species have been presumed to be purely diurnal. Yet, they show flexibility in their activity rhythm, and can occasionally be active at night. Recently, it has been suggested that chimpanzees may rarely engage in nocturnal activities in savannah forests, in contrast to the frequent nocturnal feeding of crops observed at Sebitoli, Kibale National Park, Uganda. Here we thus aimed to explore the factors that might trigger such intense nocturnal activity (e.g. harsher weather conditions during daytime, low wild food availability or higher diurnal foraging risk) in this area. We used camera-traps set over 18 km2 operating for 15 months. We report activities and group composition from records obtained either within the forest or at the forest interface with maize fields, the unique crop consumed. Maize is an attractive and accessible food source, although actively guarded by farmers, particularly during daytime. Out of the 19 156 clips collected, 1808 recorded chimpanzees. Of these, night recordings accounted for 3.3% of forest location clips, compared to 41.8% in the maize fields. Most nocturnal clips were obtained after hot days, and most often during maize season for field clips. At night within the forest, chimpanzees were travelling around twilight hours, while when at the border of the fields they were foraging on crops mostly after twilight and in smaller parties. These results suggest that chimpanzees change their activity rhythm to access cultivated resources when human presence and surveillance is lower. This survey provides evidence of behavioral plasticity in chimpanzees in response to neighboring human farming activities, and emphasizes the urgent need to work with local communities to mitigate human-wildlife conflict related to crop-feeding."
https://openalex.org/W4229458342,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are considered as crucial players in a wide variety of biological processes. Although their importance in joint diseases or infections has been shown by numerous studies, much less is known about their function in periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Our aim was to investigate activated polymorphonuclear (PMN)-derived synovial EVs in patients with PJI.(1) Is there a difference in the number and size of extracellular vesicles between periprosthetic joint aspirates of patients with PJI and aseptic loosening? (2) Are these vesicles morphologically different in the two groups? (3) Are there activated PMN-derived EVs in septic samples evaluated by flow cytometry after CD177 labelling? (4) Is there a difference in the protein composition carried by septic and aseptic vesicles?Thirty-four patients (n = 34) were enrolled into our investigation, 17 with PJI and 17 with aseptic prosthesis loosening. Periprosthetic joint fluid was aspirated and EVs were separated. Samples were analysed by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and flow cytometry (after Annexin V and CD177 labelling). The protein content of the EVs was studied by mass spectrometry (MS).NTA showed particle size distribution in both groups between 150 nm and 450 nm. The concentration of EVs was significantly higher in the septic samples (p = 0.0105) and showed a different size pattern as compared to the aseptic ones. The vesicular nature of the particles was confirmed by TEM and differential detergent lysis. In the septic group, FC analysis showed a significantly increased event number both after single and double labelling with fluorochrome conjugated Annexin V (p = 0.046) and Annexin V and anti-CD177 (p = 0.0105), respectively. MS detected a significant difference in the abundance of lactotransferrin (p = 0.00646), myeloperoxidase (p = 0.01061), lysozyme C (p = 0.04687), annexin A6 (p = 0.03921) and alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (p = 0.03146) between the studied groups.An increased number of activated PMN derived EVs were detected in the synovial fluid of PJI patients with a characteristic size distribution and a specific protein composition. The activated PMNs-derived extracellular vesicles can be potential biomarkers of PJI."

Here, we use CTRs as a tool to evaluate clinical studies conducted in Germany and test how their registration quality is associated with time and structural factors: Coordinating Centers for Clinical Trials (KKS) and Universities of Excellence.We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the DRKS, and the ICTRP for clinical trials recruiting participants in Germany. As a measure for the methodological quality, we assessed the proportion of trials that were pre-registered. In addition, the registration quality and availability of publications relating to the trials were manually assessed for a sample (n = 639). Also, the influence of the structural factors was tested using regression models.We identified 35,912 trials that were conducted in Germany. 59% of trials were pre-registered. Surprisingly, Universities of Excellence had lower pre-registration rates. The influence of KKS was unclear and also difficult to test. Interventional trials were more likely to be pre-registered. Registration quality improved over time and was higher in interventional trials. As of early 2021, 49% of trials that started until the end of 2015 have published scientific articles. 187 of 502 studies on ClinicalTrials.gov for which we found published articles did not reference any in the registry entry.The structural predictors did not show consistent relationships with the various outcome variables. However, the finding that the study type and time were related to better registration quality suggests that regulatory regimes may have an impact. Limitations of this non-pre-registered study were that no modifications to registry entries were tracked and the coarse measure of KKS involvement."
https://openalex.org/W4229021794,"Constitutive activation of the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway is a major factor in Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus pathogenesis where it is essential for the survival of primary effusion lymphoma. Central to this process is persistent upregulation of the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) complex by the virally encoded oncoprotein vFLIP. Although the physical interaction between vFLIP and the IKK kinase regulatory component essential for persistent activation, IKKγ, has been well characterized, it remains unclear how the kinase subunits are rendered active mechanistically. Using a combination of cell-based assays, biophysical techniques, and structural biology, we demonstrate here that vFLIP alone is sufficient to activate the IKK kinase complex. Furthermore, we identify weakly stabilized, high molecular weight vFLIP-IKKγ assemblies that are key to the activation process. Taken together, our results are the first to reveal that vFLIP-induced NF-κB activation pivots on the formation of structurally specific vFLIP-IKKγ multimers which have an important role in rendering the kinase subunits active through a process of autophosphorylation. This mechanism of NF-κB activation is in contrast to those utilized by endogenous cytokines and cellular FLIP homologues."
https://openalex.org/W4229022025,"A protein roadblock forms when a protein binds DNA and hinders translocation of other DNA binding proteins. These roadblocks can have significant effects on gene expression and regulation as well as DNA binding. Experimental methods for studying the effects of such roadblocks often target endogenous sites or introduce non-variable specific sites into DNAs to create binding sites for artificially introduced protein roadblocks. In this work, we describe a method to create programmable roadblocks using dCas9, a cleavage deficient mutant of the CRISPR effector nuclease Cas9. The programmability allows us to custom design target sites in a synthetic gene intended for in vitro studies. These target sites can be coded with multivalency-in our case, internal restriction sites which can be used in validation studies to verify complete binding of the roadblock. We provide full protocols and sequences and demonstrate how to use the internal restriction sites to verify complete binding of the roadblock. We also provide example results of the effect of DNA roadblocks on the translocation of the restriction endonuclease NdeI, which searches for its cognate site using one dimensional diffusion along DNA."
https://openalex.org/W4229036736,"Dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) can promote unchecked cell proliferation and cancer progression. Although focal adhesion kinase (FAK) contributes to regulating cell cycle progression, the exact molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we found that FAK plays a key role in cell cycle progression potentially through regulation of CDK4/6 protein expression. We show that FAK inhibition increased its nuclear localization and induced G1 arrest in B16F10 melanoma cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate nuclear FAK associated with CDK4/6 and promoted their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation through recruitment of CDC homolog 1 (CDH1), an activator and substrate recognition subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome E3 ligase complex. We found the FAK N-terminal FERM domain acts as a scaffold to bring CDK4/6 and CDH1 within close proximity. However, overexpression of nonnuclear-localizing mutant FAK FERM failed to function as a scaffold for CDK4/6 and CDH1. Furthermore, shRNA knockdown of CDH1 increased CDK4/6 protein expression and blocked FAK inhibitor-induced reduction of CDK4/6 in B16F10 cells. In vivo, we show that pharmacological FAK inhibition reduced B16F10 tumor size, correlating with increased FAK nuclear localization and decreased CDK4/6 expression compared with vehicle controls. In patient-matched healthy skin and melanoma biopsies, we found FAK was mostly inactive and nuclear localized in healthy skin, whereas melanoma lesions showed increased active cytoplasmic FAK and elevated CDK4 expression. Taken together, our data demonstrate that FAK inhibition blocks tumor proliferation by inducing G1 arrest, in part through decreased CDK4/6 protein stability by nuclear FAK."

All children under 5 years of age are at high risk for drowning though the risks are highest when children first learn to walk and crawl while they do not understand the danger of water. The Centre for Injury Prevention and Research, Bangladesh (CIPRB) in collaboration with Johns Hopkins International Injury Research Unit (JH-IIRU) has been implementing two drowning prevention interventions, providing playpens and community day care centres (anchal), or both in three rural sub-districts of Bangladesh under Saving of Lives from Drowning (SoLiD) project in Bangladesh. In CIPRB intervention areas, wooden playpens were distributed among the children nine months to three years at household (HH) level.The aim of this study was to explore and understand the acceptability and perceptions of parents towards playpen and its relevance for drowning and injury related mortality and morbidity prevention.Anchal mothers ('anchal maa' in Bangla) distributed 30,553 playpens and collected compliance information at the HH level using a structured questionnaire. 1600 trained anchal maas collected data via face to face interviews from May 2014 to November 2015. Playpen compliance visits were conducted periodically on the second and seventh days and every two months after delivering the playpen. Data were entered using standard data entry formats and analyzed using SPSS software version 23.Parents reported that playpen is a safe place and protects children from drowning and other injuries. During compliance data collection, anchal maa founds that 71.8% of all children were using playpen and 93.7% (of 71.8%) children were playing inside the playpen while mothers were busy with their household chores like cooking, washing dishes and clothes, taking care of their poultry and domestic animals etc. 95.7% parents reported playpen is being used for keeping the child safe. On an average, the children were placed two to six times per day in a playpen. 99.1% of the children who reported using a playpen did not get any injuries (falls, cuts and bruises) while using the playpen. Satisfaction level with the playpen intervention among mothers was 90.5%. Some respondents suggested improving the playpen utilization by providing toys, adding wheels for ease of mobility, and increasing the height.The playpens were found to be well accepted and utilized for the children, especially when mothers were busy with their household chores."

NAFLD is strongly associated with obesity and insulin resistance. The use of animal models remains a vital aspect for investigating the molecular mechanisms contributing to metabolic dysregulation and facilitating novel drug target identification. However, some differences exist between mouse and human hepatocyte physiology. Recently, chimeric mice with human liver have been generated, representing a step forward in the development of animal models relevant to human disease. Here we explored the feasibility of using one of these models (cDNA-uPA/SCID) to recapitulate obesity, insulin resistance and NAFLD upon feeding a Western-style diet. Furthermore, given the importance of a proper control diet, we first evaluated whether there are differences between feeding a purified ingredient control diet that matches the composition of the high-fat diet and feeding a grain-based chow diet. We show that mice fed chow have a higher food intake and fed glucose levels than mice that received a low-fat purified ingredient diet, suggesting that the last one represents a better control diet. Upon feeding a high-fat or matched ingredient control diet for 12 weeks, cDNA-uPA/SCID chimeric mice developed extensive macrovesicular steatosis, a feature previously associated with reduced growth hormone action. However, mice were resistant to diet-induced obesity and remained glucose tolerant. Genetic background is fundamental for the development of obesity and insulin resistance. Our data suggests that using a background that favors the development of these traits, such as C57BL/6, may be necessary to establish a humanized mouse model of NAFLD exhibiting the metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity."

The first cohort of 20 subjects from publicly available data was used for training and testing. The second cohort of 40 subjects with renal masses from our institution was used for testing only. A few-shot deep learning approach using 3D augmentation was investigated. T1-weighted images in the first cohort were used for training and testing. Cascaded CNN networks were trained using images from one, three, and six subjects, respectively. Images for the remaining subjects were used for testing. Images in the second cohort were utilized for testing only. Dice and Jaccard coefficients were generated to evaluate the performance of CNN models. Statistical analyses for segmentation metrics among different approaches were performed.Our approach achieved mean Dice coefficients of 0.85 using a single training subject and 0.91 with six training subjects. Compared to a single Unet, the cascaded network significantly improved the results using a single training subject (Dice, 0.759 vs. 0.835; p<0.001) and three subjects (0.864 vs. 0.893; p = 0.015) in the first cohort, and the results for the second cohort (0.821 vs. 0.873; p = 0.008).Our few-shot kidney segmentation approach using 3D augmentation achieved a good performance even using a single Unet. Furthermore, the cascaded network significantly improved the performance of segmentation and was superior to a single Unet in certain cases.

However, due to the lack of time or knowledge, DMs tend to provide the evaluation information by incomplete PLTSs (InPLTSs) which contain missing information. The process to estimate the missing information of InPLTSs is essential, which is called the normalization of InPLTSs. By analyzing the previous methods, the existing defect is that the original uncertainty information of InPLTS can be hardly retained after normalizing. Moreover, the literature that considers the normalization method from perspective of entropy change is absent. Thus, to overcome the shortcoming and fill the research blank, we propose two optimization models based on minimum entropy change of InPLTSs, which can remain the original uncertainty information of InPLTSs to the greatest extent. Inspired by entropy measure of PLTSs, the novel concepts related to entropy measure of InPLTS are developed. In addition, based on the novel normalization method, a decision model is constructed to solve the MAGDM problem. To verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method and model, a case about the selection of five-star scenic spots is given and we conduct to have comparative analysis with other methods."

https://openalex.org/W4229451675,"Large natural disturbances such as insect outbreaks and fire are important processes for biodiversity in forest landscapes. However, few methods exist for incorporating natural disturbances into conservation planning. Intact forest landscapes, such as in the North American boreal forest, can produce large natural disturbance footprints. They also have the potential to support large reserves but size estimates based on natural disturbance are needed to guide reserve design. Historical fire data have been used to estimate minimum dynamic reserves, reserve size estimates based on maintaining natural disturbance dynamics and ensuring resilience to large natural disturbance events. While this has been a significant step towards incorporating natural disturbance into reserve design, managers currently lack guidance on how to apply these concepts in areas where fire is not the dominant natural disturbance. We generalize the minimum dynamic reserve framework to accommodate insect outbreaks and demonstrate the framework in a case study for eastern spruce budworm ( Choristoneura fumiferana ) in the Canadian boreal forest. Our methods use geospatial analysis to identify minimum dynamic reserves based on a set of spatially explicit initial conditions, and simulation models to test for the maintenance of a set of dynamic conditions over time. We found considerable variability in minimum dynamic reserve size depending on the size of historic budworm disturbance events and the spatial patterns of disturbance-prone vegetation types. The minimum dynamic reserve framework provides an approach for incorporating wide-ranging natural disturbances into biodiversity conservation plans for both pro-active planning in intact landscapes, and reactive planning in more developed regions."
