https://openalex.org/W2028200156,"Enhancer-binding pluripotency regulators (Sox2 and Oct4) play a seminal role in embryonic stem (ES) cell-specific gene regulation. Here, we combine in vivo and in vitro single-molecule imaging, transcription factor (TF) mutagenesis, and ChIP-exo mapping to determine how TFs dynamically search for and assemble on their cognate DNA target sites. We find that enhanceosome assembly is hierarchically ordered with kinetically favored Sox2 engaging the target DNA first, followed by assisted binding of Oct4. Sox2/Oct4 follow a trial-and-error sampling mechanism involving 84-97 events of 3D diffusion (3.3-3.7 s) interspersed with brief nonspecific collisions (0.75-0.9 s) before acquiring and dwelling at specific target DNA (12.0-14.6 s). Sox2 employs a 3D diffusion-dominated search mode facilitated by 1D sliding along open DNA to efficiently locate targets. Our findings also reveal fundamental aspects of gene and developmental regulation by fine-tuning TF dynamics and influence of the epigenome on target search parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2075661710,"Synonymous mutations change the sequence of a gene without directly altering the sequence of the encoded protein. Here, we present evidence that these “silent” mutations frequently contribute to human cancer. Selection on synonymous mutations in oncogenes is cancer-type specific, and although the functional consequences of cancer-associated synonymous mutations may be diverse, they recurrently alter exonic motifs that regulate splicing and are associated with changes in oncogene splicing in tumors. The p53 tumor suppressor (TP53) also has recurrent synonymous mutations, but, in contrast to those in oncogenes, these are adjacent to splice sites and inactivate them. We estimate that between one in two and one in five silent mutations in oncogenes have been selected, equating to ∼6%– 8% of all selected single-nucleotide changes in these genes. In addition, our analyses suggest that dosage-sensitive oncogenes have selected mutations in their 3′ UTRs."
https://openalex.org/W2023975001,"Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly lethal, smoking-associated cancer with few known targetable genetic alterations. Using genome sequencing, we characterized the somatic evolution of a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of SCLC initiated by loss of Trp53 and Rb1. We identified alterations in DNA copy number and complex genomic rearrangements and demonstrated a low somatic point mutation frequency in the absence of tobacco mutagens. Alterations targeting the tumor suppressor Pten occurred in the majority of murine SCLC studied, and engineered Pten deletion accelerated murine SCLC and abrogated loss of Chr19 in Trp53; Rb1; Pten compound mutant tumors. Finally, we found evidence for polyclonal and sequential metastatic spread of murine SCLC by comparative sequencing of families of related primary tumors and metastases. We propose a temporal model of SCLC tumorigenesis with implications for human SCLC therapeutics and the nature of cancer-genome evolution in GEMMs."
https://openalex.org/W2075206648,"Dnmt1 epigenetically propagates symmetrical CG methylation in many eukaryotes. Their genomes are typically depleted of CG dinucleotides because of imperfect repair of deaminated methylcytosines. Here, we extensively survey diverse species lacking Dnmt1 and show that, surprisingly, symmetrical CG methylation is nonetheless frequently present and catalyzed by a different DNA methyltransferase family, Dnmt5. Numerous Dnmt5-containing organisms that diverged more than a billion years ago exhibit clustered methylation, specifically in nucleosome linkers. Clustered methylation occurs at unprecedented densities and directly disfavors nucleosomes, contributing to nucleosome positioning between clusters. Dense methylation is enabled by a regime of genomic sequence evolution that enriches CG dinucleotides and drives the highest CG frequencies known. Species with linker methylation have small, transcriptionally active nuclei that approach the physical limits of chromatin compaction. These features constitute a previously unappreciated genome architecture, in which dense methylation influences nucleosome positions, likely facilitating nuclear processes under extreme spatial constraints."
https://openalex.org/W1986991123,"Cancer cells are reprogrammed to utilize glycolysis at high rates, which provides metabolic precursors for cell growth. Consequently, glucose levels may decrease substantially in underperfused tumor areas. Gluconeogenesis results in the generation of glucose from smaller carbon substrates such as lactate and amino acids. The key gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), has been shown to provide metabolites for cell growth. Still, the role of gluconeogenesis in cancer is unknown. Here we show that the mitochondrial isoform of PEPCK (PCK2) is expressed and active in three lung cancer cell lines and in non-small cell lung cancer samples. PCK2 expression and activity were enhanced under low-glucose conditions. PEPCK activity was elevated threefold in lung cancer samples over normal lungs. To track the conversion of metabolites along the gluconeogenesis pathway, lung cancer cell lines were incubated with 13C3-lactate and label enrichment in the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pool was measured. Under low glucose, all three carbons from 13C3-lactate appeared in the PEP pool, further supporting a conversion of lactate to pyruvate, via pyruvate carboxylase to oxaloacetate, and via PCK2 to phosphoenolpyruvate. PCK2 small interfering RNA and the pharmacological PEPCK inhibitor 3-mercaptopicolinate significantly enhanced glucose depletion-induced apoptosis in A549 and H23 cells, but not in H1299 cells. The growth of H23 multicellular spheroids was significantly reduced by 3-mercaptopicolinate. The results of this study suggest that lung cancer cells may utilize at least some steps of gluconeogenesis to overcome the detrimental metabolic situation during glucose deprivation and that in human lung cancers this pathway is activated in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2137867563,"How the circadian clock regulates the timing of sleep is poorly understood. Here, we identify a Drosophila mutant, wide awake (wake), that exhibits a marked delay in sleep onset at dusk. Loss of WAKE in a set of arousal-promoting clock neurons, the large ventrolateral neurons (l-LNvs), impairs sleep onset. WAKE levels cycle, peaking near dusk, and the expression of WAKE in l-LNvs is Clock dependent. Strikingly, Clock and cycle mutants also exhibit a profound delay in sleep onset, which can be rescued by restoring WAKE expression in LNvs. WAKE interacts with the GABAA receptor Resistant to Dieldrin (RDL), upregulating its levels and promoting its localization to the plasma membrane. In wake mutant l-LNvs, GABA sensitivity is decreased and excitability is increased at dusk. We propose that WAKE acts as a clock output molecule specifically for sleep, inhibiting LNvs at dusk to promote the transition from wake to sleep."
https://openalex.org/W2056869894,"The activated tumor stroma participates in many processes that control tumorigenesis, including tumor cell growth, invasion and metastasis. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the major cellular component of the stroma and are the main source for connective tissue components of the extracellular matrix and various classes of proteolytic enzymes. The signaling pathways involved in the interactions between tumor and stromal cells and the molecular characteristics that distinguish normal ‘resting’ fibroblasts from cancer-associated or ‘-activated’ fibroblasts remain poorly defined. Recent studies emphasized the prognostic and therapeutic significance of CAF-related molecular signatures and a number of those genes have been shown to serve as putative therapeutic targets. We have used immuno-laser capture microdissection and whole-genome Affymetrix GeneChip analysis to obtain transcriptional signatures from the activated tumor stroma of colon carcinomas that were compared with normal resting colonic fibroblasts. Several members of the Wnt-signaling pathway and gene sets related to hypoxia, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) pathway activation were induced in CAFs. The putative TGFβ-target IGFBP7 was identified as a tumor stroma marker of epithelial cancers and as a tumor antigen in mesenchyme-derived sarcomas. We show here that in contrast to its tumor-suppressor function in epithelial cells, IGFPB7 can promote anchorage-independent growth in malignant mesenchymal cells and in epithelial cells with an EMT phenotype when IGFBP7 is expressed by the tumor cells themselves and can induce colony formation in colon cancer cells co-cultured with IGFBP7-expressing CAFs by a paracrine tumor–stroma interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2058096544,"The three PRL (phosphatases of regenerating liver) protein tyrosine phosphatases (PRL-1, -2 and -3) have been identified as key contributors to metastasis in several human cancers, yet the molecular basis of their pro-oncogenic property is unclear. Among the subfamily of PRL phosphatases, overexpression of PRL-2 in breast cancer cells has been shown to promote tumor growth by a mechanism that remains to be uncovered. Here we show that PRL-2 regulates intracellular magnesium levels by forming a functional heterodimer with the magnesium transporter CNNM3. We further reveal that CNNM3 is not a phosphorylated substrate of PRL-2, and that the interaction occurs through a loop unique to the CBS pair domains of CNNM3 that exists only in organisms having PRL orthologs. Supporting the role of PRL-2 in cellular magnesium transport is the observation that PRL-2 knockdown results in a substantial decrease of cellular magnesium influx. Furthermore, in PRL-2 knockout mice, serum magnesium levels were significantly elevated as compared with control animals, indicating a pivotal role for PRL-2 in regulating cellular magnesium homeostasis. Although the expression levels of CNNM3 remained unchanged after magnesium depletion of various cancer cell lines, the interaction between endogenous PRL-2 and CNNM3 was markedly increased. Importantly, xenograft tumor assays with CNNM3 and a mutant form that does not associate with PRL-2 confirm that CNNM3 is itself pro-oncogenic, and that the PRL-2/CNNM3 association is important for conferring transforming activities. This finding is further confirmed from data in human breast cancer tissues showing that CNNM3 levels correlate positively with both PRL-2 expression and the tumor proliferative index. In summary, we demonstrate that oncogenic PRL-2 controls tumor growth by modulating intracellular magnesium levels through binding with the CNNM3 magnesium transporter."
https://openalex.org/W2022732234,"Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been associated with increased aggressiveness and acquisition of migratory properties providing tumor cells with the ability to invade into adjacent tissues. Downregulation of E-cadherin, a hallmark of EMT, is mediated by several transcription factors (EMT-TFs) that act also as EMT inducers, among them, Snail1 and the bHLH transcription factor E47. We previously described lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2), a member of the lysyl oxidase family, as a Snail1 regulator and EMT inducer. Here we show that LOXL2 is also an E47-interacting partner and functionally collaborates in the repression of E-cadherin promoter. Loss and gain of function analyses combined with in vivo studies in syngeneic breast cancer models demonstrate the participation of LOXL2 and E47 in tumor growth and their requirement for lung metastasis. Furthermore, LOXL2 and E47 contribute to early steps of metastatic colonization by cell and noncell autonomous functions regulating the recruitment of bone marrow progenitor cells to the lungs and by direct transcriptional regulation of fibronectin and cytokines TNFα, ANG-1 and GM-CSF. Moreover, fibronectin and GM-CSF proved to be necessary for LOXL2/E47-mediated modulation of tumor growth and lung metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2009859786,"Ectopic expression of specific factors such as Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 (OSK) is sufficient to reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In this study, we examine the paths taken by cells during the reprogramming process by following the transcriptional activation of two pluripotent miRNA clusters (mir-290 and mir-302) in individual cells in vivo and in vitro with knockin reporters. During embryonic development and embryonic stem cell differentiation, all cells sequentially expressed mir-290 and mir-302. In contrast, during OSK-induced reprogramming, cells activated the miRNA loci in a stochastic, nonordered manner. However, the addition of Sall4 to the OSK cocktail led to a consistent reverse sequence of locus activation (mir-302 then mir-290) and increased reprogramming efficiency. These results demonstrate that cells can follow multiple paths during the late stages of reprogramming, and that the trajectory of any individual cell is strongly influenced by the combination of factors introduced."
https://openalex.org/W1980836971,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) promotes cell motility, which is important for the metastasis of malignant cells, and blocks CD95-mediated apoptotic signaling triggered by immune cells and chemotherapeutic regimens. CD95L, the cognate ligand of CD95, can be cleaved by metalloproteases and released as a soluble molecule (cl-CD95L). Unlike transmembrane CD95L, cl-CD95L does not induce apoptosis but triggers cell motility. Electron paramagnetic resonance was used to show that EMT and cl-CD95L treatment both led to augmentation of plasma membrane fluidity that was instrumental in inducing cell migration. Compaction of the plasma membrane is modulated, among other factors, by the ratio of certain lipids such as sphingolipids in the membrane. An integrative analysis of gene expression in NCI tumor cell lines revealed that expression of ceramide synthase-6 (CerS6) decreased during EMT. Furthermore, pharmacological and genetic approaches established that modulation of CerS6 expression/activity in cancer cells altered the level of C16-ceramide, which in turn influenced plasma membrane fluidity and cell motility. Therefore, this study identifies CerS6 as a novel EMT-regulated gene that has a pivotal role in the regulation of cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2087212218,"Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo fusion and fission processes. These events are regulated by mitochondria-shaping proteins. Changes in the expression and/or localization of these proteins lead to a mitochondrial dynamics impairment and may promote apoptosis. Increasing evidence correlates the mitochondrial dynamics disruption with the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we focused on this topic in Manganese (Mn)-induced Parkinsonism, a disorder associated with Mn accumulation preferentially in the basal ganglia where mitochondria from astrocytes represent an early target. Using MitoTracker Red staining we observed increased mitochondrial network fission in Mn-exposed rat astrocytoma C6 cells. Moreover, Mn induced a marked decrease in fusion protein Opa-1 levels as well as a dramatic increase in the expression of fission protein Drp-1. Additionally, Mn provoked a significant release of high MW Opa-1 isoforms from the mitochondria to the cytosol as well as an increased Drp-1 translocation to the mitochondria. Both Mdivi-1, a pharmacological Drp-1 inhibitor, and rat Drp-1 siRNA reduced the number of apoptotic nuclei, preserved the mitochondrial network integrity and prevented cell death. CsA, an MPTP opening inhibitor, prevented mitochondrial Δψm disruption, Opa-1 processing and Drp-1 translocation to the mitochondria therefore protecting Mn-exposed cells from mitochondrial disruption and apoptosis. The histological analysis and Hoechst 33258 staining of brain sections of Mn-injected rats in the striatum showed a decrease in cellular mass paralleled with an increase in the occurrence of apoptotic nuclei. Opa-1 and Drp-1 expression levels were also changed by Mn-treatment. Our results demonstrate for the first time that abnormal mitochondrial dynamics is implicated in both in vitro and in vivo Mn toxicity. In addition we show that the imbalance in fusion/fission equilibrium might be involved in Mn-induced apoptosis. This knowledge may provide new therapeutic tools for the treatment of Manganism and other neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2095027692,"The DNA damage checkpoint is essential for the maintenance of genome integrity after genotoxic stress, and also for cell survival in eukaryotes. Claspin has a key role in the ATR (ATM and Rad3-related)-Chk1 branch of the DNA damage checkpoint and is also required for correct DNA replication. To achieve properly these functions, Claspin is tightly regulated by ubiquitinin-dependent proteasomal degradation, which controls Claspin levels in a DNA-damage- and cell-cycle-dependent manner. Here, we identified a new regulator of Claspin, the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 29, USP29. Downregulation of USP29 destabilizes Claspin, whereas its overexpression promotes an increase in Claspin levels. USP29 interacts with Claspin and is able to deubiquitinate it both in vivo and in vitro. Most importantly, USP29 knockdown results in an impaired phosphorylation of Chk1 after DNA damage and USP29-depleted cells show a major defect in the S-phase progression. With these results, we identified USP29 as a new player in the ATR-Chk1 pathway and the control of DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1969192576,"The contagious aspect of yawning is a well-known phenomenon that exhibits variation in the human population. Despite the observed variation, few studies have addressed its intra-individual reliability or the factors modulating differences in the susceptibility of healthy volunteers. Due to its obvious biological basis and impairment in diseases like autism and schizophrenia, a better understanding of this trait could lead to novel insights into these conditions and the general biological functioning of humans. We administered 328 participants a 3-minute yawning video stimulus, a cognitive battery, and a comprehensive questionnaire that included measures of empathy, emotional contagion, circadian energy rhythms, and sleepiness. Individual contagious yawning measurements were found to be highly stable across testing sessions, both in a lab setting and if administered remotely online, confirming that certain healthy individuals are less susceptible to contagious yawns than are others. Additionally, most individuals who failed to contagiously yawn in our study were not simply suppressing their reaction, as they reported not even feeling like yawning in response to the stimulus. In contrast to previous studies indicating that empathy, time of day, or intelligence may influence contagious yawning susceptibility, we found no influence of these variables once accounting for the age of the participant. Participants were less likely to show contagious yawning as their age increased, even when restricting to ages of less than 40 years. However, age was only able to explain 8% of the variability in the contagious yawn response. The vast majority of the variability in this extremely stable trait remained unexplained, suggesting that studies of its inheritance are warranted."

Here, we show that eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding proteins (4E-BPs), which are translational repressors, have a multifaceted effect on the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Loss of 4E-BP expression attenuates the induction of iPSCs at least in part through increased translation of p21, a known inhibitor of somatic cell reprogramming. However, MEFs lacking both p53 and 4E-BPs show greatly enhanced reprogramming resulting from a combination of reduced p21 transcription and enhanced translation of endogenous mRNAs such as Sox2 and Myc and can be reprogrammed through the expression of only exogenous Oct4. Thus, 4E-BPs exert both positive and negative effects on reprogramming, highlighting the key role that translational control plays in regulating this process.

Thus, 4E-BPs exert both positive and negative effects on reprogramming, highlighting the key role that translational control plays in regulating this process. Transcription is suppressed during oocyte maturation and the initial divisions of the zygote, when the egg and sperm genomes undergo reprogramming (de Vries et al., 2008de Vries W.N. Evsikov A.V. Brogan L.J. Anderson C.P. Graber J.H. Knowles B.B. Solter D. Reprogramming and differentiation in mammals: motifs and mechanisms.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2008; 73: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Within this window of time, gene expression is largely controlled at the level of mRNA translation (Latham et al., 1991Latham K.E.

Extensive reprogramming at the one- and two-cell stages.Development. 1991; 112: 921-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Factor-induced reprogramming has primarily been linked to transcriptional and epigenetic events (Buganim et al., 2012Buganim Y. Faddah D.A. Cheng A.W. Itskovich E. Markoulaki S. Ganz K.

However, genome-wide analyses have indicated that the cellular proteome is mainly controlled at the translation level, and there is a limited correlation between mRNA and protein levels (Courtes et al., 2013Courtes F.C.

The role of translational control in the reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has not been investigated. Initiation is the rate-limiting step of translation and is subject to extensive control (Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009Sonenberg N. Hinnebusch A.G. Regulation of translation initiation in eukaryotes: mechanisms and biological targets.Cell. 2009; 136: 731-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2248) Google Scholar). At this step, mRNA is recruited to the ribosome by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex, which consists of the cap binding protein eIF4E, the scaffolding protein eIF4G, and the RNA helicase eIF4A (Jackson et al., 2010Jackson R.J. Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V. The mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation and principles of its regulation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar). Although eIF4E is required for cap-dependent translation of all nuclear transcribed cellular mRNAs, it preferentially stimulates the translation of a subset of “eIF4E-sensitive” mRNAs, which includes mRNAs encoding proliferation- and survival-promoting proteins (Graff et al., 2008Graff J.R. Konicek B.W. Carter J.H. Marcusson E.G. Targeting the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E for cancer therapy.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of mRNA to eIF4E can be dictated by the structure and sequence of its 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) (Hsieh et al., 2012Hsieh A.C. Liu Y. Edlind M.P. Ingolia N.T. Janes M.R. Sher A.

The translation of mRNAs with long and structured 5′ UTRs is more dependent on eIF4E activity, and this can be explained by the stimulation of the eIF4A helicase activity by eIF4E (Feoktistova et al., 2013Feoktistova K. Tuvshintogs E. Do A. Fraser C.S. Human eIF4E promotes mRNA restructuring by stimulating eIF4A helicase activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 13339-13344Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The eIF4E binding proteins (4E-BP1, 4E-BP2, and 4E-BP3 in mammals) are translational inhibitors that, when dephosphorylated (activated), avidly bind eIF4E. The interactions of 4E-BPs with eIF4E prevent the association of eIF4E with eIF4G, which impair the assembly of the eIF4F complex (Pause et al., 1994Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donzé O.

The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) phosphorylates (inactivates) the 4E-BPs, leading to their dissociation from eIF4E (Gingras et al., 1999Gingras A.C. Gygi S.P. Raught B.

Notably, mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BPs is increased during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation (Sampath et al., 2008Sampath P. Pritchard D.K. Pabon L. Reinecke H. Schwartz S.M. Morris D.R. Murry C.E. A hierarchical network controls protein translation during murine embryonic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 448-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), suggesting that 4E-BPs may also affect somatic cell reprogramming. Here, we demonstrate that eIF4E-dependent translational control via 4E-BPs plays an important role in regulating the factor-induced reprogramming. We also describe a crosstalk between the activity of 4E-BPs and the p53-p21 pathway in this process. To study the role of 4E-BPs in reprogramming, we first examined the phosphorylation status of 4E-BP1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), mouse ESCs, and mouse iPSCs. iPSCs were generated by infecting wild-type (WT) MEFs with lentiviruses expressing the reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc (OSKM) (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K.

As expected, the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was markedly lower in iPSCs and ESCs in comparison to MEFs (He et al., 2012He J. Kang L. Wu T. Zhang J. Wang H. Gao H. Zhang Y. Huang B. Liu W.

To ensure that the observed decrease in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was not restricted to a subset of pluripotent cell lines, we monitored the phosphorylation levels of 4E-BP1 in various pluripotent cells whose pluripotency had been previously verified by chimeric contribution (Figure S1A available online). The cell lines include one ESC clone from B6CBAF1 mice (f-ESC), two ESC clones generated via somatic cell nuclear transfer (FNTESC and F-NtESC from B6;CBA and B6;129 genetic backgrounds, respectively), one ESC clone generated by parthenogenesis ([MII] ESC), and three iPSC clones derived from neural progenitor cells (NP-iPSCs), early hematopoietic progenitor cells (B-iPSC), and B-lymphocytes (BL-iPSC) (Hanna et al., 2008Hanna J.

Thus, low 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (high activity) is a salient feature of pluripotent cells, irrespective of their origin. In addition to 4E-BPs, ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and S6K2 are major downstream targets of mTORC1 (Zoncu et al., 2011Zoncu R. Efeyan A. Sabatini D.M. mTOR: from growth signal integration to cancer, diabetes and ageing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (3174) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (S6), which is a substrate of S6K1 and S6K2, was decreased in the pluripotent cells relative to MEFs, demonstrating that the activity of mTORC1 was lower in the pluripotent cells in comparison to MEFs (Figures 1A and S1A). Next, we focused on the role of 4E-BPs in the induction of pluripotency. First, we examined the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in MEFs transduced with OSKM. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6 was markedly reduced early in reprogramming (Figure S1B). This result is consistent with a previous report that showed that intermediate stage reprogramming cells had lower mTORC1 activity than nonreprogramming cells (He et al., 2012He J. Kang L. Wu T. Zhang J. Wang H. Gao H. Zhang Y. Huang B. Liu W. Kou Z. et al.An elaborate regulation of Mammalian target of rapamycin activity is required for somatic cell reprogramming induced by defined transcription factors.Stem Cells Dev. 2012; 21: 2630-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We also examined the role of 4E-BPs in reprogramming by expressing OSKM in WT and 4E-BP1/2−/− (double knockout [DKO]) MEFs. The DKO MEFs are devoid of all 4E-BPs, given that 4E-BP3 is not expressed in MEFs (Dowling et al., 2010Dowling R.J. Topisirovic I. Alain T. Bidinosti M. Fonseca B.D. Petroulakis E. Wang X. Larsson O. Selvaraj A. Liu Y. et al.mTORC1-mediated cell proliferation, but not cell growth, controlled by the 4E-BPs.Science. 2010; 328: 1172-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of S6 was not significantly different between the GFP-expressing WT and DKO MEFs (Figure 1B, lanes 1 and 2). Despite similar inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in the OSKM-expressing WT and DKO MEFs, as measured by the decrease in S6 phosphorylation (Figure 1B, lanes 3 and 4), the DKO MEFs formed significantly fewer primary iPSC colonies than the WT MEFs, as monitored by alkaline phosphatase (AP) and NANOG immunofluorescence staining (Figures 1D and 1G). Importantly, lentivirus infection efficiency and translation of AP and Nanog mRNAs were not affected by the 4E-BP status (Figures S1C–S1E and S2D). Although the DKO MEFs displayed a prolonged doubling time at later passages (passage ≥ 6), the defects in reprogramming cannot be explained by changes in the proliferation capacity of the DKO MEFs, given that early-passage MEFs (passage ≤ 3) were used for reprogramming and that doubling time of the DKO MEFs at early passages is similar to that of the WT MEFs (Petroulakis et al., 2009Petroulakis E. Parsyan A. Dowling R.J. LeBacquer O. Martineau Y. Bidinosti M. Larsson O. Alain T. Rong L. Mamane Y. et al.p53-dependent translational control of senescence and transformation via 4E-BPs.Cancer Cell. 2009; 16: 439-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the attenuation of reprogramming in the DKO MEFs was caused by inadvertent changes that may have occurred during MEF isolation, we depleted 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 in WT MEFs (Figures 1E, 1H, and S1F) and re-expressed 4E-BP1 in the DKO MEFs (Figures 1F and 1I). Whereas depletion of the 4E-BPs attenuated reprogramming (Figures 1E and 1H), ectopic expression of 4E-BP1 rescued the reprogramming deficiency of the DKO MEFs, as determined by the increase in AP+ and NANOG+ colonies (Figures 1F and 1I). Notably, overexpression of WT 4E-BP1 in WT MEFs failed to promote reprogramming (Figures S1I–S1K). Altogether, these data demonstrate that 4E-BPs are necessary and required for the reprogramming of MEFs in a dose-dependent manner. 4E-BPs impede translation initiation by binding and sequestering eIF4E (Pause et al., 1994Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Insulin-dependent stimulation of protein synthesis by phosphorylation of a regulator of 5′-cap function.Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). To determine whether the binding of 4E-BPs to eIF4E is required for reprogramming, we expressed OSKM in DKO MEFs that harbor WT 4E-BP1 or a mutant lacking the eIF4E binding site (Δ4E-BS) (Rong et al., 2008Rong L. Livingstone M. Sukarieh R. Petroulakis E. Gingras A.C. Crosby K. Smith B. Polakiewicz R.D. Pelletier J. Ferraiuolo M.A. Sonenberg N. Control of eIF4E cellular localization by eIF4E-binding proteins, 4E-BPs.RNA. 2008; 14: 1318-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The number of AP+ colonies formed by cells expressing the Δ4E-BS mutant was similar to that observed in control cells (DKO MEFs expressing vector) but was lower than that detected in cells expressing WT 4E-BP1 (Figure S1G). To investigate whether the ability of the 4E-BPs to inhibit eIF4F complex assembly correlates with the induction of reprogramming, we performed an m7GDP-agarose pull-down assay (Figure 1C). Infection of WT MEFs with OSKM led to a reduction in eIF4F complex levels, as illustrated by the increase in the amount of 4E-BP1 and the decrease in the amount of eIF4GI pulled down by m7GDP-agarose in comparison to GFP-infected cells 7 days after infection (Figure 1C, lanes 1 and 2). As expected, such a change did not occur in the OSKM-expressing DKO MEFs (Figure 1C, lanes 3 and 4). Collectively, these data identify an important function of 4E-BPs in promoting reprogramming by binding to eIF4E and disrupting eIF4F complex assembly on mRNAs encoding inhibitors of reprogramming. In response to overexpression of reprogramming factors, cells activate the p53/p21 pathway to maintain genomic integrity during iPSC induction (Hong et al., 2009Hong H. Takahashi K. Ichisaka T. Aoi T. Kanagawa O. Nakagawa M. Okita K. Yamanaka S.

Takahashi K. Ichisaka T. Aoi T. Kanagawa O. Nakagawa M. Okita K. Yamanaka S. Suppression of induced pluripotent stem cell generation by the p53-p21 pathway.Nature. 2009; 460: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar), and cell types with higher reprogramming efficiency, such as keratinocytes, express relatively low levels of p21 protein (Kawamura et al., 2009Kawamura T. Suzuki J. Wang Y.V. Menendez S. Morera L.B. Raya A. Wahl G.M. Izpisúa Belmonte J.C. Linking the p53 tumour suppressor pathway to somatic cell reprogramming.Nature. 2009; 460: 1140-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). DKO MEFs express higher amounts of p21 protein in comparison to WT MEFs, and this disparity in p21 amounts was sustained 7 and 12 days after OSKM infection (Figures 1B and S2H). In contrast, no differences were found in p21 mRNA levels between WT and DKO MEFs (Figure 2A ). Similar to the DKO MEFs, downregulation of 4E-BP1 and 2 promotes the expression of p21 protein in MEFs (Figure S1H) (Kannan-Thulasiraman et al., 2008Kannan-Thulasiraman P. Dolniak B. Kaur S. Sassano A. Kalvakolanu D.V. Hay N. Platanias L.C. Role of the translational repressor 4E-BP1 in the regulation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression by retinoids.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 368: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Altogether, these findings indicate that 4E-BP-dependent regulation of p21 mRNA translation plays an important role in reprogramming. To further investigate the p21 mRNA translation control, we performed a polysome profiling assay to directly examine whether the 4E-BPs suppress the translation initiation of p21 mRNA during reprogramming (Figure 2B). Polysomes from OSKM-infected WT and DKO MEFs (12 days after infection) were fractionated with sucrose density gradients. In this assay, mRNAs whose translation initiation is efficient are associated with heavy polysomes, and they sediment faster than poorly translated mRNAs, which are associated with light polysomes (Warner et al., 1963Warner J.R. Knopf P.M. Rich A. A multiple ribosomal structure in protein synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1963; 49: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The absorbance profiles of the gradient fractions indicated a modest increase in global translation in the OSKM-infected DKO MEFs relative to the WT MEFs, as judged by an increase in polysome content with a concomitant decrease in the 80S peak (Figure 2B). Significantly, p21 mRNA was preferentially associated with heavier polysomes in the DKO MEFs (fractions 6–8) in comparison to the WT MEFs, in which p21 mRNA was associated with lighter polysomes (fractions 5–6; Figure 2C; Figure S2A). In sharp contrast, the positions of the p53, Gapdh, β-actin, and Nanog mRNAs were not affected by the 4E-BP status (Figures 2C and S2B–S2D). Altogether, these results demonstrate that 4E-BPs selectively suppress the translation of p21 mRNA and that the reduced reprogramming efficiency of the DKO MEFs stems from their inability to suppress p21 mRNA translation. This conclusion is supported by the finding that p21 depletion partially alleviated the inhibition of reprogramming in DKO MEFs (Figures S2E–S2G). However, it is highly likely that other eIF4E-sensitive genes are also involved, given that the depletion of p21 could not fully rescue the reprogramming deficiency of the DKO MEFs. p53 inhibits reprogramming largely by activating p21 transcription (Hong et al., 2009Hong H. Takahashi K. Ichisaka T. Aoi T. Kanagawa O. Nakagawa M. Okita K. Yamanaka S.

As expected, due to the loss of p53 expression, p21 mRNA and protein were barely detectable in p53−/− (p53KO) and p53−/−;4E-BP1/2−/− (TKO) MEFs (Figure 2D and S2H–S2J). Therefore, we reasoned that the loss of p53 expression should rescue the feeble reprogramming caused by the loss of 4E-BP expression. To investigate this hypothesis, we expressed reprogramming factors in the WT, DKO, p53KO, and TKO MEFs and monitored reprogramming efficiency. Consistent with previous reports (Hong et al., 2009Hong H. Takahashi K. Ichisaka T. Aoi T. Kanagawa O. Nakagawa M. Okita K. Yamanaka S.

Immortalization eliminates a roadblock during cellular reprogramming into iPS cells.Nature. 2009; 460: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), reprogramming efficiency, as determined by the number of AP+ and NANOG+ colonies, was higher in the p53KO MEFs than it was in the WT MEFs (Figures 2E and 2F). Surprisingly, the number of iPSC colonies formed by the TKO MEFs was significantly higher than that formed by the p53KO MEFs (mean = 1,107 AP+ colonies in the OSKM-expressing p53KO MEFs versus 2,915 AP+ colonies in the OSKM-expressing TKO MEFs; p = 0.003) (Figures 2E and 2F). These effects were not a consequence of differences in the infection efficiency between the p53KO and TKO MEFs (Figures S2K and S2L). Importantly, these effects were p53 dependent, given that p53 re-expression in the TKO MEFs led to increased p21 protein amounts and suppressed reprogramming (Figures S2M and S2N). As expected, overexpression of 4E-BP1 in the p53KO and TKO MEFs inhibited reprogramming with a more significant effect on the TKO MEFs (Figures 2G–2J). An increase in the number of primary iPSC colonies in the TKO MEFs, relative to the p53KO MEFs, was also detected in cells infected with OSK or OS (Figures 2E and 2F). Remarkably, the expression of Oct4 alone was sufficient to generate iPSCs from the TKO MEFs (Figures S3A and S3B), albeit at a very small number (two to ten expandable iPSC colonies per 40,000 Oct4-infected TKO MEFs in three experiments) but not from the p53KO MEFs. Oct4-induced TKO iPSCs (Oct4-TKO-iPSCs) maintained the expression of ESC specific markers, such as Nanog, Rex1, and stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (Figures 3A–3C and S3C), and differentiated into cells originating from all three germ layers, including functional neurons, blood vessels, muscle, bone, adipose, and gut-like tissues in teratoma and embryoid body formation assays (Figures 3D–3H and 4A–4C). Next, we determined the ability of the Oct4-TKO-iPSCs to produce chimeric offspring. The loss of p53 leads to aneuploidy and therefore dramatically decreases the efficacy of chimera generation (Menendez et al., 2010Menendez S. Camus S. Izpisua Belmonte J.C. p53: guardian of reprogramming.Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 3887-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we selected a clone of the Oct4-TKO-iPSCs that was devoid of alterations in chromosome number (Oct4-TKO-iPSC-11; Figure S4A) and expressed enhanced GFP (eGFP+). This clone was injected into mouse blastocysts. Oct4-TKO-iPSC-11 contributed to the generation of chimeras, as evident in the prenatal embryos, live-born neonates, and young pups (Figures 4D and S4B–S4D and Table S1). Chimeras were scored with eGFP fluorescence at the whole-body surface level of the embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) embryos (Figure 4Di), and the 24 hr old neonates (Figure 4Dii) or as the mosaic colored chimeras in young pups (Figure 4Diii). Chimera contribution was also quantified as eGFP fluorescence in the whole body of ten independent E14.5–E16.5 prenatal chimeric embryos (Figure S4B and Table S1) and organs such as heart, liver, and gonads (testis) of E16.5 chimeric embryos (Figure S4C). Germline competency was also confirmed by the presence of both eGFP+ and THY-1+ gonadal cells (Figure S4D) and the chimera-derived offspring. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Oct4-TKO-iPSCs are fully reprogrammed and pluripotent. At the molecular level, mTORC1 signaling was suppressed to a comparable extent in the OSKM-expressing p53KO"
https://openalex.org/W2094450098,"Repetitive DNA sequences play an important role in the structural and functional organization of chromosomes, especially in sex chromosome differentiation. The genus Triportheus represents an interesting model for such studies because all of its species analyzed so far contain a ZZ/ZW sex chromosome system. A close relationship has been found between the differentiation of the W chromosome and heterochromatinization, with the involvement of different types of repetitive DNA in this process. This study investigated several aspects of this association in the W chromosome of Triportheus trifurcatus (2 n = 52 chromosomes), including the cytogenetic mapping of repetitive DNAs such as telomeric sequences (TTAGGG)n, microsatellites and retrotransposons. A remarkable heterochromatic segment on the W chromosome was observed with a preferential accumulation of (CAC)10, (CAG)10, (CGG)10, (GAA)10 and (TA)15. The retrotransposons Rex1 and Rex3 showed a general distribution pattern in the chromosomes, and Rex6 showed a different distribution on the W chromosome. The telomeric repeat (TTAGGG)n was highly evident in both telomeres of all chromosomes without the occurrence of ITS. Thus, the differentiation of the W chromosome of T. trifurcatus is clearly associated with the formation of heterochromatin and different types of repetitive DNA, suggesting that these elements had a prominent role in this evolutionary process."
https://openalex.org/W2084811906,"Recent studies suggest that medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood, is comprised of four disease variants. The WIP1 oncogene is overexpressed in Group 3 and 4 tumors, which contain medulloblastomas with the most aggressive clinical behavior. Our data demonstrate increased WIP1 expression in metastatic medulloblastomas, and inferior progression-free and overall survival of patients with WIP1 high-expressing medulloblastoma. Microarray analysis identified upregulation of genes involved in tumor metastasis, including the G protein-coupled receptor CXCR4, in medulloblastoma cells with high WIP1 expression. Stimulation with the CXCR4 ligand SDF1α activated PI-3 kinase signaling, and promoted growth and invasion of WIP1 high-expressing medulloblastoma cells in a p53-dependent manner. When xenografted into the cerebellum of immunodeficient mice, medulloblastoma cells with stable or endogenous high WIP1 expression exhibited strong expression of CXCR4 and activated AKT in primary and invasive tumor cells. WIP1 or CXCR4 knockdown inhibited medulloblastoma growth and invasion. WIP1 knockdown also improved the survival of mice xenografted with WIP1 high-expressing medulloblastoma cells. WIP1 knockdown inhibited cell surface localization of CXCR4 by suppressing expression of the G protein receptor kinase 5, GRK5. Restoration of wild-type GRK5 promoted Ser339 phosphorylation of CXCR4 and inhibited the growth of WIP1-stable medulloblastoma cells. Conversely, GRK5 knockdown inhibited Ser339 phosphorylation of CXCR4, increased cell surface localization of CXCR4 and promoted the growth of medulloblastoma cells with low WIP1 expression. These results demonstrate crosstalk among WIP1, CXCR4 and GRK5, which may be important for the aggressive phenotype of a subclass of medulloblastomas in children."
https://openalex.org/W1999878307,"Rationale Pulmonary coagulopathy may play a pathogenetic role in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), by contributing to alveolocapillary inflammation and increased permeability. Recombinant human activated protein C (rh-APC) may inhibit this process and thereby improve patient outcome. Methods A prospective randomized, saline-controlled, single-blinded clinical trial was performed in the intensive care units of two university hospitals, and patients with ARDS were included within 24 h after meeting inclusion criteria. Intervention A 4-day course of intravenous rh-APC (24 mcg/kg/h) (n = 33) versus saline (n = 38). Outcomes The primary outcome parameter was the pulmonary leak index (PLI) of 67Gallium-transferrin as a measure of alveolocapillary permeability and secondary outcomes were disease severity scores and ventilator-free days, among others. Results Baseline characteristics were similar; in 87% of patients the PLI was above normal and in 90% mechanical or non-invasive ventilation was instituted at a median lung injury score of 2.5. There was no evidence that Rh-APC treatment affected the PLI or attenuated lung injury and sequential organ failure assessment scores. Mean ventilator-free days amounted to 14 (rh-APC) and 12 days (saline, P = 0.35). 28-day mortality was 6% in rh-APC- and 18% in saline-treated patients (P = 0.12). There was no difference in bleeding events. The study was prematurely discontinued because rh-APC was withdrawn from the market. Conclusion There is no evidence that treatment with intravenous rh-APC during 4 days for infectious or inflammatory ARDS ameliorates increased alveolocapillary permeability or the clinical course of ARDS patients.

https://openalex.org/W2018427238,"Extracellular proteins are vital for cell activities, such as cell migration. Calumenin is highly conserved among eukaryotes, but its functions are largely unclear. Here, we identify extracellular calumenin as a suppressor of cell migration and tumor metastasis. Calumenin binds to and stabilizes fibulin-1, leading to inactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling. We further identify the minimal functional domain of calumenin (amino acids 74-138 and 214-280). Depletion of calumenin induces fibulin-1- and phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2)-dependent promotion of cell migration. Consistently, in hepatocellular and pancreatic carcinoma, both calumenin and fibulin-1 are downregulated. Furthermore, we show that matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) proteolyzes fibulin-1 and that calumenin protects fibulin-1 from cleavage by MMP-13. Calumenin, together with fibulin-1, also interacts with fibronectin and depends on both syndecan-4 and α5β1-integrin to suppress ERK1/2 signaling and inhibit cell migration. Thus, extracellular calumenin regulates fibulin-1 to have crucial roles in ERK1/2 signaling and cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2072662409,"MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expressions of many genes. Previously, we found that the expression of p55PIK, an isoform of phosphatidylinosotol 3-kinase that has important roles in the regulation of cell cycle, is increased significantly in several types of cancer and contributes to the tumor growth. However, the mechanism for this increased p55PIK expression is not well understood. In this study, we show that miR-148b binds specifically to the 3′-untranslated region of p55PIK and significantly suppresses p55PIK expression. MiR-148b overexpression abolished p55PIK stimulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines and decreased tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that p53 directly activates the transcription of miR-148b by binding to its promoter. In CRC cell lines and tissues, p53 expression was associated with miR-148b expression, and both were negatively associated with p55PIK expression. Our study shows that the p53/miR-148b/p55PIK axis has an important role in cell proliferation and tumor growth, and may represent a novel therapeutic target for treating cancers containing p53 mutations or losses."
https://openalex.org/W2074005766,"Bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by Mycobacterium bovis, is an infectious disease of cattle that also affects other domestic animals, free-ranging and farmed wildlife, and also humans. In Mozambique, scattered surveys have reported a wide variation of bTB prevalence rates in cattle from different regions. Due to direct economic repercussions on livestock and indirect consequences for human health and wildlife, knowing the prevalence rates of the disease is essential to define an effective control strategy.A cross-sectional study was conducted in Govuro district to determine bTB prevalence in cattle and identify associated risk factors. A representative sample of the cattle population was defined, stratified by livestock areas (n = 14). A total of 1136 cattle from 289 farmers were tested using the single comparative intradermal tuberculin test. The overall apparent prevalence was estimated at 39.6% (95% CI 36.8-42.5) using a diagnostic threshold cut-off according to the World Organization for Animal Health. bTB reactors were found in 13 livestock areas, with prevalence rates ranging from 8.1 to 65.8%. Age was the main risk factor; animals older than 4 years were more likely to be positive reactors (OR = 3.2, 95% CI: 2.2-4.7). Landim local breed showed a lower prevalence than crossbred animals (Landim × Brahman) (OR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4-0.8).The findings reveal an urgent need for intervention with effective, area-based, control measures in order to reduce bTB prevalence and prevent its spread to the human population. In addition to the high prevalence, population habits in Govuro, particularly the consumption of raw milk, clearly may potentiate the transmission to humans. Thus, further studies on human tuberculosis and the molecular characterization of the predominant strain lineages that cause bTB in cattle and humans are urgently required to evaluate the impact on human health in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2010328673,"When exposed to DNA-damaging agents, components of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway trigger apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. Although failures in this pathway are associated with cancer development, the tumor suppressor roles of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis have recently been questioned in mouse models. Using Drosophila epithelial cells that are unable to activate the apoptotic program, we provide evidence that ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage elicits a tumorigenic behavior in terms of E-cadherin delocalization, cell delamination, basement membrane degradation and neoplasic overgrowth. The tumorigenic response of the tissue to IR is enhanced by depletion of Okra/DmRAD54 or spnA/DmRAD51—genes required for homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA double-strand breaks in G2—and it is independent of the activity of Lig4, a ligase required for nonhomologous end-joining repair in G1. Remarkably, depletion of Grapes/DmChk1 or Mei-41/dATR—genes affecting DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest in G2—compromised DNA repair and enhanced the tumorigenic response of the tissue to IR. On the contrary, DDR-independent lengthening of G2 had a positive impact on the dynamics of DNA repair and suppressed the tumorigenic response of the tissue to IR. Our results support a tumor suppressor role of apoptosis, DNA repair by HR and cell cycle arrest in G2 in simple epithelia subject to IR-induced DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2085198453,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor2/Neu, which is overexpressed in about 30% of human breast cancers, transduces growth signals in large part via the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. Nevertheless, it is a matter of controversy whether high ERK activity in breast cancer tissues correlates with better or worse prognosis, leaving the role of ERK activity in the progression of breast cancers unresolved. To address this issue, we live-imaged ERK activity in mammary tumors developed in mouse mammary tumor virus-Neu transgenic mice, which had been crossed with transgenic mice expressing a Förster resonance energy transfer biosensor for ERK. Observation of the tumor by two-photon microscopy revealed significant heterogeneity in ERK activity among the mammary tumor cells. The level of ERK activity in each cell was stable up to several hours, implying a robust mechanism that maintained the ERK activity within a limited range. By sorting the mammary tumor cells on the basis of their ERK activity, we found that ERK(high) cells less efficiently generated tumorspheres in vitro and tumors in vivo than did ERK(low) cells. In agreement with this finding, the expressions of the cancer stem cell markers CD49f, CD24 and CD61 were decreased in ERK(high) cells. These observations suggest that high ERK activity may suppress the self-renewal of mammary cancer stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2014664126,"Evidence suggests that many types of cancers are composed of different cell types, including cancer stem cells (CSCs). We have previously shown that the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which is thought to be an important mechanism for generating CSCs. In the present study, we investigate whether oxaliplatin-treated cancer tissues possess characteristics of CSCs, and explore oxaliplatin resistance in these tissues.Hepatocellular carcinoma cells (MHCC97H cells) were subcutaneously injected into mice to form tumors, and the mice were intravenously treated with either oxaliplatin or glucose. Five weeks later, the tumors were orthotopically xenografted into livers of other mice, and these mice were treated with either oxaliplatin or glucose. Metastatic potential, sensitivity to oxaliplatin, and expression of CSC-related markers in the xenografted tumor tissues were evaluated. DNA microarrays were used to measure changes in gene expression as a result of oxaliplatin treatment. Additionally, an oxaliplatin-resistant cell line (MHCC97H-OXA) was established to assess insulin-like growth factor 1 secretion, cell invasion, cell colony formation, oxaliplatin sensitivity, and expression of CSC-related markers. The effects of an insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor inhibitor were also assessed.Oxaliplatin treatment inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth. Tumors from oxaliplatin-treated mice that were subsequently xenografted into livers of other mice exhibited that decreasing sensitivity to oxaliplatin and increasing pulmonary metastatic potential. Among the expression of CSC-related proteins, the gene for insulin-like growth factor 1, was up-regulated expecially in these tumor tissues. Additionally, MHCC97H-OXA cells demonstrated that increasing cell invasion, colony formation, and expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 and CSC-related markers, whereas treatment with an inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor suppressed these effects.Maintenance of stemness in oxaliplatin-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cells is associated with increased autocrine of IGF1."
https://openalex.org/W2061240036,"Human rhinovirus is a key viral trigger for asthma exacerbations. To date, murine studies investigating rhinovirus-induced exacerbation of allergic airways disease have employed systemic sensitisation/intranasal challenge with ovalbumin. In this study, we combined human-rhinovirus infection with a clinically relevant mouse model of aero-allergen exposure using house-dust-mite in an attempt to more accurately understand the links between human-rhinovirus infection and exacerbations of asthma. Adult BALB/c mice were intranasally exposed to low-dose house-dust-mite (or vehicle) daily for 10 days. On day 9, mice were inoculated with human-rhinovirus-1B (or UV-inactivated human-rhinovirus-1B). Forty-eight hours after inoculation, we assessed bronchoalveolar cellular inflammation, levels of relevant cytokines/serum antibodies, lung function and responsiveness/sensitivity to methacholine. House-dust-mite exposure did not result in a classical TH2-driven response, but was more representative of noneosinophilic asthma. However, there were significant effects of house-dust-mite exposure on most of the parameters measured including increased cellular inflammation (primarily macrophages and neutrophils), increased total IgE and house-dust-mite-specific IgG1 and increased responsiveness/sensitivity to methacholine. There were limited effects of human-rhinovirus-1B infection alone, and the combination of the two insults resulted in additive increases in neutrophil levels and lung parenchymal responses to methacholine (tissue elastance). We conclude that acute rhinovirus infection exacerbates house-dust-mite-induced lung disease in adult mice. The similarity of our results using the naturally occurring allergen house-dust-mite, to previous studies using ovalbumin, suggests that the exacerbation of allergic airways disease by rhinovirus infection could act via multiple or conserved mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2017562727,"Glioblastomas (GBM) are highly radioresistant and lethal brain tumors. Ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are a risk factor for the development of GBM. In this study, we systematically examined the contribution of IR-induced DSBs to GBM development using transgenic mouse models harboring brain-targeted deletions of key tumor suppressors frequently lost in GBM, namely Ink4a, Ink4b, Arf and/or PTEN. Using low linear energy transfer (LET) X-rays to generate simple breaks or high LET HZE particles (Fe ions) to generate complex breaks, we found that DSBs induce high-grade gliomas in these mice which, otherwise, do not develop gliomas spontaneously. Loss of Ink4a and Arf was sufficient to trigger IR-induced glioma development but additional loss of Ink4b significantly increased tumor incidence. We analyzed IR-induced tumors for copy number alterations to identify oncogenic changes that were generated and selected for as a consequence of stochastic DSB events. We found Met amplification to be the most significant oncogenic event in these radiation-induced gliomas. Importantly, Met activation resulted in the expression of Sox2, a GBM cancer stem cell marker, and was obligatory for tumor formation. In sum, these results indicate that radiation-induced DSBs cooperate with loss of Ink4 and Arf tumor suppressors to generate high-grade gliomas that are commonly driven by Met amplification and activation."
https://openalex.org/W2031494939,"Arterial stiffness is increased in patients with CKD and is a powerful predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Use of the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol has been shown to improve endothelial function, reduce left ventricular hypertrophy and possibly improve cardiovascular outcome. We explored the relationship between use of allopurinol and arterial stiffness in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).Cross-sectional observational study of 422 patients with CKD with evidence of, or at high risk of, renal disease progression. Arterial stiffness was determined by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV).The mean age was 63 ± 16 years, median estimated glomerular filtration rate was 25 (interquartile range: 19-31) ml/min/1.73 m(2) and mean PWV was 10.2 ± 2.4 m/s. Seventy-seven patients (18%) were receiving regular allopurinol, 61% at a dose of 100 mg/day (range: 50-400 mg/day). Patients receiving allopurinol had significantly lower peripheral pulse pressure, central pulse pressure, central systolic blood pressure, serum uric acid level tissue advanced glycation end product levels but comparable high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. Use of allopurinol was associated with lower PWV. After adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, tissue advanced glycation end product level, peripheral pulse pressure, smoking pack years, presence of diabetes mellitus and use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, the use of allopurinol remained a significant independent determinant of PWV (mean difference: -0.63 m/s; 95% CI, -0.09 to -1.17 m/s, p = 0.02).In patients with CKD, use of allopurinol is independently associated with lower arterial stiffness. This study provides further justification for a large definitive randomised controlled trial examining the therapeutic potential of allopurinol to reduce cardiovascular risk in people with CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2025312459,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of diseases that seriously affect elderly people's quality of life. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) offer a potential promise for the joint repair in OA patients. However, chondrogenic differentiation from hMSCs in vitro takes a long time (∼ 6 weeks) and differentiated cells are still not as functionally mature as primary isolated chondrocytes, though chemical stimulations and mechanical loading have been intensively studied to enhance the hMSC differentiation. On the other hand, thermal stimulations of hMSC chondrogenesis have not been well explored. In this study, the direct effects of mild heat shock (HS) on the differentiation of hMSCs into chondrocytes in 3D pellet culture were investigated. Periodic HS at 41 °C for 1 hr significantly increased sulfated glycosaminoglycan in 3D pellet culture at Day 10 of chondrogenesis. Immunohistochemical and Western Blot analyses revealed an increased expression of collagen type II and aggrecan in heat-shocked pellets than non heat-shocked pellets on Day 17 of chondrogenesis. In addition, HS also upregulated the expression of collagen type I and X as well as heat shock protein 70 on Day 17 and 24 of differentiation. These results demonstrate that HS accelerated the chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs and induced an early maturation of chondrocytes differentiated from hMSCs. The results of this study will guide the design of future protocols using thermal treatments to facilitate cartilage regeneration with human mesenchymal stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2061474617,"Raised bogs have accumulated more atmospheric carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. Climate-induced expansion of trees and shrubs may turn these ecosystems from net carbon sinks into sources when associated with reduced water tables. Increasing water loss through tree evapotranspiration could potentially deepen water tables, thus stimulating peat decomposition and carbon release. Bridging the gap between modelling and field studies, we conducted a three-year mesocosm experiment subjecting natural bog vegetation to three birch tree densities, and studied the changes in subsurface temperature, water balance components, leaf area index and vegetation composition. We found the deepest water table in mesocosms with low tree density. Mesocosms with high tree density remained wettest (i.e. highest water tables) whereas the control treatment without trees had intermediate water tables. These differences are attributed mostly to differences in evapotranspiration. Although our mesocosm results cannot be directly scaled up to ecosystem level, the systematic effect of tree density suggests that as bogs become colonized by trees, the effect of trees on ecosystem water loss changes with time, with tree transpiration effects of drying becoming increasingly offset by shading effects during the later phases of tree encroachment. These density-dependent effects of trees on water loss have important implications for the structure and functioning of peatbogs."

Yet the specific pathological changes and the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. We aimed to reveal the specific morphological changes of different striatal neurons in the HD model. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to unilaterally intrastriatal injections of QA to mimic the HD model. Behavioral tests, histochemical and immunhistochemical stainings as well as Western blots were applied in the present study. The results showed that QA-treated rats had obvious motor and cognitive impairments when compared with the control group. Immunohistochemical detection showed a great loss of NeuN+ neurons and Darpp32+ projection neurons in the transition zone in the QA group when compared with the control group. The numbers of parvalbumin (Parv)+ and neuropeptide Y (NPY)+ interneurons were both significantly reduced while those of calretinin (Cr)+ and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)+ were not changed notably in the transition zone in the QA group when compared to the controls. Parv+, NPY+ and ChAT+ interneurons were not significantly increased in fiber density while Cr+ neurons displayed an obvious increase in fiber density in the transition zone in QA-treated rats. The varicosity densities of Parv+, Cr+ and NPY+ interneurons were all raised in the transition zone after QA treatment. In conclusion, the present study revealed that QA induced obvious behavioral changes as well as a general loss of striatal projection neurons and specific morphological changes in different striatal interneurons, which may help further explain the underlying mechanisms and the specific functions of various striatal neurons in the pathological process of HD."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the corneal alterations in rabbits following exposure to commercial solution of latanoprost, travoprost and bimatoprost. A total of 64 New Zealand albino rabbits were used and four groups of treatments were constituted. Commercial latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost or 0.02% benzalkonium chloride (BAK) was applied once daily to one eye each of rabbits for 30 days. The contralateral untreated eyes used as controls. Schirmer test, tear break-up time (BUT), rose Bengal and fluorescein staining were performed on days 5, 10, 20, and 30. Central corneal changes were analyzed by in vivo confocal microscopy, and the corneal barrier function was evaluated by measurement of corneal transepithelial electrical resistance on day 5. Whole mount corneas were analyzed by using fluorescence confocal microscopy for the presence of tight-junction (ZO-1, occludin) and adherens-junction (E-cadherin, β-catenin) proteins, actin cytoskeleton, proliferative marker Ki67 and cell apoptosis in the epithelium. Topical application of commercial PG analogs resulted in significant corneal epithelial and stromal defects while no significant changes in aqueous tear production, BUT, rose bengal and fluorescein staining scores on day 5. Commercial PG analogs induced dislocation of ZO-1 and occludin from their normal locus, disorganization of cortical actin cytoskeleton at the superficial layer, and disruption of epithelial barrier function. The eyes treated with 0.02% BAK and latanoprost exhibited significantly reduced Schirmer scores, BUT, and increased fluorescein staining scores on days 10 and 30, respectively. Topical application of commercial PG analogs can quickly impair the corneal epithelium and stroma without tear deficiency. Commercial PG analogs break down the barrier integrity of corneal epithelium, concomitant with the disruption of cell junction and actin cytoskeleton between superficial cells in the corneal epithelium in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2047090897,"Heparanase promotes tumor invasion and metastasis in several malignancies including breast cancer. However, the roles and regulation mechanisms of heparanase during breast cancer progression are still not fully understood. The aim of this study is to determine the differential regulation of heparanase gene expression in specific stages of breast cancer by DNA methylation. We detected levels of heparanase expression and DNA methylation patterns of its promoter in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435) and clinical tissues, respectively. It has been observed that heparanase is highly expressed in the invasive MDA-MB-435 cells with low methylation modification in the heparanase promoter. In contrast, lower expression of heparanase in MCF-7 cells is accompanied by higher methylation in the promoter. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), a potent demethylating agent, results in induction of heparanase expression and higher invasion potential in vitro and leads to an advantage of tumor formation in vivo. In 54 tissue samples, cancer samples at late stages (stage IV) showed the highest heparanase expression accomplished by little DNA methylation. On the contrary, methylation prevalence is highest in normal tissue and inversely correlated with heparanase expression. A significant correlation between DNA methylation and clinical stage was demonstrated (p = 0.012). Collectively, these results demonstrate that DNA methylation play the regulation role in heparanase gene in different stages of breast cancer and present a direct effect on tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2076156407,"A pilot eliminating user fees associated with delivery at the point of services was introduced in two districts of Laos in March 2009. Following two years of implementation, an evaluation was conducted to assess the pilot impact, as well as to document the pilot design and implementation challenges. Study results show that, even in the presence of the substantial access and cultural barriers, user fees associated with delivery at health facilities act as a serious deterrent to care seeking behavior. We find a tripling of facility-based delivery rates in the intervention areas, compared to a 40% increase in the control areas. While findings from the control region suggest that facility-based delivery rates may be on the rise across the country, the substantially higher increase in the pilot areas highlight the impact of financial burden associated with facility-based delivery fees. These fees can play an important role in rapidly increasing the uptake of facility delivery to reach the national targets and, ultimately, to improve maternal and child health outcomes. The pilot achieved important gains while relying heavily on capacity and systems already in place. However, the high cost associated with monitoring and evaluation suggest broad-scale expansion of the pilot activities is likely to necessitate targeted capacity building initiatives, especially in areas with limited district level capacity to manage funds and deliver detailed and timely reports."
https://openalex.org/W2092390526,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1), mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) and p53 play important roles in the development of cancer. We examined whether the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PTEN, AKT1, MDM2 and p53 genes were related to the risk and severity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the Chinese population. Seven SNPs [p53 rs1042522, PTEN rs11202592, AKT1 SNP1-5 (rs3803300, rs1130214, rs3730358, rs1130233 and rs2494732)] were genotyped in 593 NPC cases and 480 controls by PCR direct sequencing or PCR-RFLP analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). None of the polymorphisms alone was associated with the risk or severity of NPC. However, haplotype analyses indicated that a two-SNP core haplotype (SNP4-5, AA) in AKT1 was associated with a significantly increased susceptibility to NPC risk (adjusted OR = 3.87, 95% CI = 1.96-7.65; P<0.001). Furthermore, there was a significantly increased risk of NPC associated with the combined risk genotypes (i.e., p53 rs1042522 Arg/Pro + Pro/Pro, MDM2 rs2279244 G/T + G/G, PTEN rs11202592 C/C, AKT1 rs1130233 A/A). Compared with the low-risk group (0-2 combined risk genotypes), the high-risk group (3-4 combined risk genotypes) was associated with a significantly increased susceptibility to NPC risk (adjusted OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.12-2.50; P = 0.012). Our results suggest that genetic variants in the PTEN, AKT1, MDM2 and p53 tumor suppressor-oncoprotein network may play roles in mediating the susceptibility to NPC in Chinese populations."

MASP-2 levels have been associated with different polymorphisms within MASP2 gene as well as with the risk for inflammatory disorders and infections. Despite its clinical importance, MASP-2 remains poorly investigated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).In this case-control study, we measured MASP-2 serum levels in 156 RA patients, 44 patient relatives, and 100 controls from Southern Brazil, associating the results with nine MASP2 polymorphisms in all patients, 111 relatives, and 230 controls genotyped with multiplex SSP-PCR.MASP-2 levels were lower in patients than in controls and relatives (medians 181 vs. 340 or 285 ng/ml, respectively, P<0.0001). Conversely, high MASP-2 levels were associated with lower susceptibility to RA and to articular symptoms independently of age, gender, ethnicity, smoking habit, anti-CCP and rheumatoid factor positivity (OR = 0.05 [95%CI = 0.019-0.13], P<0.0001 between patients and controls; OR = 0.12, [95%CI = 0.03-0.45], P = 0.002 between patients and relatives; OR = 0.06, [95%CI = 0.004-0.73], P = 0.03 between relatives with and without articular symptoms). MASP2 haplotypes *2A1 and *2B1-i were associated with increased susceptibility to RA (OR = 3.32 [95%CI = 1.48-7.45], P = 0.004). Deficiency-causing p.120G and p.439H substitutions were associated with five times increased susceptibility to articular symptoms in relatives (OR = 5.13 [95%CI = 1.36-20.84], P = 0.02). There was no association of MASP-2 levels or MASP2 polymorphisms with autoantibodies, Sjögren's syndrome, nodules and functional class.In this study, we found the first evidence that MASP-2 deficiency might play an important role in the development of RA and articular symptoms among relatives of RA patients."
https://openalex.org/W1977049317,"Vestibular disorder is the cause of approximately 50% of dizziness in older people. The vestibular system is a critical postural control mechanism, and posturography analysis is helpful for diagnosing vestibular disorder. In clinical practice, the sensory organization test (SOT) is used to quantify postural control in an upright stance under different test conditions. However, both aging and vestibular disorder cause declines of postural control mechanisms. The aim of this study was to enhance the performance of the SOT using a nonlinear algorithm of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and to verify the differences of effects caused by aging and/or illnesses benefits to clinical diagnosis. A total of 51 subjects belonging to 3 groups—healthy-young, healthy-elderly and dizzy—were recruited for this study. New dynamic parameters of the SOT were derived from the center of pressure (COP) signals. EMD served as an adaptive filter bank to derive the low- and high-frequency components of the COP. The effects on four ratios of sensory analysis caused by aging and vestibular disorder can be investigated for the specific frequency bands. According to our findings, new SOT parameters derived from the component with the specific frequency band more sensitively reflect the functional condition of vestibular dysfunction. Furthermore, both aging and vestibular dysfunction caused an increase in magnitude for the low-frequency component of the AP-direction COP time series. In summary, the low-frequency fluctuation reflects the stability of postural control, while the high-frequency fluctuation is sensitive to the functional condition of the sensory system. EMD successfully improved the accuracy of SOT measurements in this investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1991367443,"High cellular heterogeneity within neuroblastomas (NBs) may account for the non-uniform response to treatment. c-KIT(+) cells are frequently detected in NB, but how they influence NB behavior still remains elusive. Here, we used NB tumor-initiating cells to reconstitute NB development and demonstrated that c-KIT(+) cells are de novo generated and dynamically maintained within the tumors to sustain tumor progression. c-KIT(+) NB cells express higher levels of neural crest and stem cell markers (SLUG, SOX2 and NANOG) and are endowed with high clonogenic capacity, differentiation plasticity and are refractory to drugs. With serial transplantation assays, we found that c-KIT expression is not required for tumor formation, but c-KIT(+) cells are more aggressive and can induce tumors ninefold more efficiently than c-KIT(-/low) cells. Intriguingly, c-KIT(+) cells exhibited a long-term in vivo self-renewal capacity to sustain the formation of secondary and tertiary tumors in mice. In addition, we showed that Prokineticin signaling and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways are crucial for the maintenance of c-KIT(+) cells in tumor to promote NB progression. Our results highlight the importance of this de novo population of NB cells in sustainable growth of NB and reveal specific signaling pathways that may provide targets leading to more effective NB therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2050627293,"Background Accumulating evidence has shown that several non-HLA genes are involved in the susceptibility to polymyositis/dermatomyositis. This study aimed to investigate the involvement of C8orf13–BLK, one of the strongest candidate genes for autoimmune diseases, in susceptibility to polymyositis/dermatomyositis in the Japanese population. A possible gene–gene interaction between C8orf13–BLK and STAT4, which we recently showed to be associated with Japanese polymyositis/dermatomyositis, was also analyzed. Methods A single-nucleotide polymorphism in C8orf13–BLK (dbSNP ID: rs13277113) was investigated in the Japanese population using a TaqMan assay in 283 polymyositis patients, 194 dermatomyositis patients, and 656 control subjects. Results The C8orf13–BLK rs13277113A allele was associated with overall polymyositis/dermatomyositis (P<0.001, odds ratio [OR] 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19–1.73), as well as polymyositis (P = 0.011, OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.06–1.64) and dermatomyositis (P<0.001, OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.26–2.12). No association was observed between the C8orf13–BLK rs13277113A allele and either interstitial lung disease or anti-Jo-1 antibody positivity. The C8orf13–BLK rs13277113 A and STAT4 rs7574865 T alleles had an additive effect on polymyositis/dermatomyositis susceptibility. The strongest association was observed in dermatomyositis, with an OR of 3.07 (95% CI; 1.57–6.02) for the carriers of four risk alleles at the two SNP sites, namely, rs1327713 and rs7574865. Conclusions This study established C8orf13–BLK as a new genetic susceptibility factor for polymyositis/dermatomyositis. Both C8orf13–BLK and STAT4 exert additive effects on disease susceptibility. These observations suggested that C8orf13–BLK, in combination with STAT4, plays a pivotal role in creating genetic susceptibility to polymyositis/dermatomyositis in Japanese individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2052764996,"Introduction The performance of violence risk assessment instruments can be primarily investigated by analysing two psychometric properties: discrimination and calibration. Although many studies have examined the discrimination capacity of the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (VRAG) and other actuarial risk assessment tools, few have evaluated how well calibrated these instruments are. The aim of the present investigation was to replicate the development study of the VRAG in Europe including measurements of discrimination and calibration. Method Using a prospective study design, we assessed a total cohort of violent offenders in the Zurich Canton of Switzerland using the VRAG prior to discharge from prisons, secure facilities, and outpatient clinics. Assessors adhered strictly to the assessment protocol set out in the instrument’s manual. After controlling for attrition, 206 offenders were followed in the community for a fixed period of 7 years. We used charges and convictions for subsequent violent offenses as the outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to measure discrimination, and Sanders’ decomposition of the Brier score as well as Bayesian credible intervals were calculated to measure calibration. Results The discrimination of the VRAG’s risk bins was modest (area under the curve = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.63–0.81, p<0.05). However, the calibration of the tool was poor, with Sanders’ calibration score suggesting an average assessment error of 21% in the probabilistic estimates associated with each bin. The Bayesian credible intervals revealed that in five out of nine risk bins the intervals did not contain the expected risk rates. Discussion Measurement of the calibration validity of risk assessment instruments needs to be improved, as has been done with respect to discrimination. Additional replication studies that focus on the calibration of actuarial risk assessment instruments are needed. Meanwhile, we recommend caution when using the VRAG probabilistic risk estimates in practice."

Its clinical manifestations overlap with those of familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHLH). Since PERFORIN (PRF1) mutations are present in FHLH, we analysed its role in a series of 12 nasal and 12 extranasal-NKTCLs. 12.5% of the tumours and 25% of the nasal-origin cases had the well-known g.272C>T(p.Ala91Val) pathogenic SNP, which confers a poor prognosis. Two of these cases had a double-CD4/CD8-positive immunophenotype, although no correlation was found with perforin protein expression. p53 was overexpressed in 20% of the tumoral samples, 80% of which were of extranasal origin, while none showed PRF1 SNVs. These results suggest that nasal and extranasal NKTCLs have different biological backgrounds, although this requires validation."
https://openalex.org/W2026423184,"Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an inherited syndrome in which tumours in multiple organs are characterised by activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Previous work suggests that mTORC1 activation is associated with feedback inhibition of Akt, a substrate of mTORC2. This could limit TSC-associated tumour growth but lead to paradoxical promotion of tumour cell survival upon treatment with mTOR inhibitors. However, Akt/mTOR signalling has not been fully investigated in TSC-associated tumours and it has been uncertain whether mTOR inhibition can prevent TSC-associated renal tumourigenesis. In this study, we investigated Akt/mTOR signalling in renal tumours using a Tsc2+/− mouse model and tested whether mTOR inhibition could prevent renal tumourigenesis. We found that all renal lesions including cysts, adenomas and carcinomas exhibited activation of both Akt and mTORC1 as evidenced by increased protein expression and phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR and their downstream targets. Protein kinase Cα was also highly expressed and phosphorylated in these lesions, consistent with activation of mTORC2. Surprisingly, IRS proteins were highly expressed, in contrast to a striking decrease seen in cultured Tsc2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting one mechanism through which loss of feedback inhibition of Akt may occur in mTORC1 hyperactivated Tsc-associated tumours. Long-term treatment with rapamycin reduced both Akt and mTORC1 activity in normal kidney tissues and blocked the development of all types of renal lesions. In conclusion, in contrast to previous studies, we found that Akt signalling is not inhibited in Tsc-associated renal lesions and that by partially inhibiting the Akt/mTOR pathway, rapamycin is highly effective in preventing Tsc-associated tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2040928468,"Numerous studies support a role of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (Pten) as a tumor suppressor gene that controls epithelial cell homeostasis to prevent tumor formation. Mouse vaginal epithelium cyclically exhibits cell proliferation and differentiation in response to estrogen and provides a unique model for analyzing homeostasis of stratified squamous epithelia. We analyzed vaginal epithelium-specific Pten conditional knockout (CKO) mice to provide new insights into Pten/phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt function. The vaginal epithelium of ovariectomized (OVX) mice (control) was composed of 1–2 layers of cuboidal cells, whereas OVX CKO mice exhibited epithelial hyperplasia in the suprabasal cells with increased cell mass and mucin production. This is possibly due to misactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Intriguingly, estrogen administration to OVX Pten CKO mice induced stratification and keratinized differentiation in the vaginal epithelium, as in estrogen-treated controls. We found that Pten is exclusively expressed in the suprabasal cells in the absence of estrogens, whereas estrogen administration induced Pten expression in the basal cells. This suggests that Pten acts to prevent excessive cell proliferation as in the case of other squamous tissues. Thus, Pten exhibits a dual role on the control of vaginal homeostasis, depending on whether estrogens are present or absent. Our results provide new insights into how Pten functions in tissue homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2087203388,"We address the problem of assigning biological function to solved protein structures. Computational tools play a critical role in identifying potential active sites and informing screening decisions for further lab analysis. A critical parameter in the practical application of computational methods is the precision, or positive predictive value. Precision measures the level of confidence the user should have in a particular computed functional assignment. Low precision annotations lead to futile laboratory investigations and waste scarce research resources. In this paper we describe an advanced version of the protein function annotation system FEATURE, which achieved 99% precision and average recall of 95% across 20 representative functional sites. The system uses a Support Vector Machine classifier operating on the microenvironment of physicochemical features around an amino acid. We also compared performance of our method with state-of-the-art sequence-level annotator Pfam in terms of precision, recall and localization. To our knowledge, no other functional site annotator has been rigorously evaluated against these key criteria. The software and predictive models are incorporated into the WebFEATURE service at http://feature.stanford.edu/wf4.0-beta."
https://openalex.org/W2060911870,"Education is one of the most important drivers behind helping people in developing countries lift themselves out of poverty. However, even when schooling is available absenteeism rates can be high. Recently interest has focussed on whether or not WASH interventions can help reduce absenteeism in developing countries. However, none has focused exclusively on the role of drinking water provision. We report a study of the association between absenteeism and provision of treated water in containers into schools.We undertook a quasi-experimental longitudinal study of absenteeism rates in 8 schools, 4 of which received one 20 L container of treated drinking water per day. The water had been treated by filtration and ultraviolet disinfection. Weekly absenteeism rates were compared across all schools using negative binomial model in generalized estimating equations. There was a strong association with provision of free water and reduced absenteeism (Incidence rate ratio = 0.39 (95% Confidence Intervals 0.27-0.56)). However there was also a strong association with season (wet versus dry) and a significant interaction between receiving free water and season. In one of the intervention schools it was discovered that the water supplier was not fulfilling his contract and was not delivering sufficient water each week. In this school we showed a significant association between the number of water containers delivered each week and absenteeism (IRR = 0.98 95%CI 0.96-1.00).There appears to be a strong association between providing free safe drinking water and reduced absenteeism, though only in the dry season. The mechanism for this association is not clear but may in part be due to improved hydration leading to improved school experience for the children."
https://openalex.org/W2005601997,"Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of applying R2* values to differentiate hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) from cavernous hemangiomas of the liver (CHL). Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the participating Institutional Review Board and written informed consent for all subjects were obtained. Seventy-three patients with 79 pathologically identified HCCs and 65 patients with 91 clinically or pathologically identified CHLs were enrolled in this study. All subjects underwent a breath-hold multi-echo T2* weighted MR imaging on a 1.5T clinical MR scanner. R2* values from HCC and CHL groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric U test. A cut-off value of R2* was evaluated with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results The mean R2* value was 23.32±12.23 Hz (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.58 Hz, 26.06 Hz) for the HCC group, and 3.66±2.37 Hz (95% CI: 3.17 Hz, 4.15 Hz) for the CHL group. The mean R2* value for HCC was significantly higher than that of CHL (p<0.001). A threshold of 9.48 Hz for the minimum R2* value in the diagnosis of HCC resulted in a sensitivity of 96.20% (76 out of 79 patients), and a specificity of 97.80% (89 out of 91 patients). The positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and diagnostic accuracy for HCC were 97.44% (76 out of 78 patients), 96.74% (89 out of 92 patients) and 97.06% (165 out of 170 patients), respectively. The AUC for differentiation between these two groups was 0.994 (95% CI: 0.980, 1.000). Conclusions R2* is a significant MRI biomarker to differentiate HCC from CHL with satisfying sensitivity and specificity."
