https://openalex.org/W2043050081,"Extracts prepared from Gonyaulax cells harvested late in the 12-hour dark period of an artificial 24-hour day contain as much as four times more luciferin activity than similar extracts prepared during the light period. If cultures are not treated with heat or light to reduce the flashing associated with handling, the time of maximum activity is obscured."
https://openalex.org/W1968241404,"Infrared reflection spectra have been recorded for a large number of inorganic and organic samples, including minerals and biological specimens, for the purpose of interpreting the 3-to 4-micro spectrum of Mars. A previous suggestion that the Martian bands indicated the presence of carbohydrates is shown not to be a required conclusion. However, no satisfactory explanation is advanced and the problem remains unresolved."

https://openalex.org/W2071677351,"When virgin male cabbage loopers were exposed to filter-paper strips containing an extract from female abdomens, they exhibited a response lasting from 2 to 5 minutes. Gases of a component (or components) of these extracts emanating from a chromatography column attracted the males and then evoked the same response. The attractant is fairly volatile and has relatively low molecular weight."

https://openalex.org/W2040645740,"The earthquake return periods (the mean interoccurrence time) and the probability of earthquake occurrences for southern New England are calculated from the available seismic data for the period 1725 through 1974. For this region the occurrence of larger earthquakes varied with time and the seismic activity was higher in the period 1725 through 1824 than in the next 100 years (1825 through 1924). This variation introduces large uncertainties into calculations of the earthquake hazard. The estimated return period, based on data covering the time period 1725 through 1974, for earthquakes in the southern New England area of intensity VI or greater is 25 years and for intensity VIII or greater is 130 years."

https://openalex.org/W2027577611,"A compound of composition RbAlSi(3)O(8), with a structure of double sheets of silica-alumina tetrahedra with common apices held together by rubidium ions in 12-fold coordination, may be crystallized from a melt by rapid cooling. The compound is an analog of the metastable forms of the calcium, barium, strontium, and lead feldspars."

https://openalex.org/W2088163831,The Joint Commission on Prescription Drug Use was formed in order to find a way to monitor drugs on the market. The Commission is supported in part by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA). However the members of the Commission come from a wide variety of backgrounds so that bias is minimized. The chairman of the Commission hopes to develop a system to monitor the drugs after they have been released on the market a so-called phase 4 study. The diethylstilbestrol scandal the MER-29 catastrophy and the loss for many of a drug with many beneficial side effects must be managed by maintaining records which would make benefits or problems of drugs known. It will be necessary to define the limits of the information needed in order to establish a reporting system. There needs to be a framework in which to identify patterns. Physicians must also be willing to pay attention to side effects and report them. The Commission has a great potential for significantly affecting the process by which drugs are regulated in this country.
