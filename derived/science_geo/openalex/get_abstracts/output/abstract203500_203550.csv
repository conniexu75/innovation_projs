Meiosis commences in mice 8 to 10 days old. The highest frequency of any one phase of meiosis was found at days 17 to 19, when 47 percent of the tubules were found to contain late pachytene."

After treatment with a disulfide-splitting reagent, the molecular weight was 56,000, and the products migrated as a single peak in the ultracentrifuge. he univalent fragments thus formed can be partially recombined by passage through IR-120 cation-exchange resin at room temperature or by treatment with a difunctional organic mercurial. Some splitting of the pepsin-treated antibody molecule occurs on carboxymethylcellulose at pH 5.4."

The increase of unit discharge occurred in advance of the onset of polypnea , and the unit has little phasic response or after discharge, and shows little adaptation."

https://openalex.org/W1978589764,"An unusual morphologic arrangement of interrenal and chromaffin tissues has been observed in two families of teleost fishes. In most teleosts in which these cell types occur together in association with the postcardinal veins and their branches, the chromaffin cells are located between the lumen of the vein and the interrenal cells. This typical relationship is reversed in some of the Labridae and Scaridae."

https://openalex.org/W2047826733,Animals trained to respond to sound stimuli were found to perform the learned response when they were electrically stimulated through electrodes chronically implanted in subcortical structures of the auditory pathway. Other animals trained to respond to electrical stimulation of subcortical auditory structures showed differential transfer effects depending on the positions of the stimulating electrodes.

https://openalex.org/W2064873876,Information is summarized on the various types of radiation that were found in space using satellites and space probes. The physical natures of the radiations are discussed. together with the mechanisms by which the radiation interacts with matter. Dosage levels are defined. The salient factors in the choice of shielding are discussed. An assessment is made of the importance of radiations in space to space missions. (B.O.G.)

https://openalex.org/W1970790558,"INFECTIOUS ribonucleic acid (RNA) has been extracted by phenol treatment1 from cells infected with animal viruses. In Group B of the arbor viruses, it has been recently reported that the RNA extracted from mouse brain infected with Murrary Valley encephalitis virus2 or Japanese B virus3 and from Ehrlich ascites tumour cells infected with West Nile encephalitis4 are infectious. The purpose of this present communication is to add a datum concerning the extraction of infectious RNA from mouse brains infected with dengue fever virus to the reports of viral RNA already published, and to compare the effects of cold- and hot-phenol extractions on the yields of infectious RNA from the cells infected with Japanese B encephalitis virus and dengue fever virus, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2028180164,Sequential measurements were made of the free amino-acid pool in the premitotic region of microspores of Lilium longiflorum. The basic amino acid arginine appears in the pool and then disappears. Arginine appears at the same developmental stage at which it has been reported that the free deoxynucleosides appear

The method has been applied in finding the vectorcardiograms of turtle and rabbit hearts.
