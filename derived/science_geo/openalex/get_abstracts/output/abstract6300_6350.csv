https://openalex.org/W2113597524,"The complete nucleotide sequence of hepatitis B virus genome (subtype ayw) cloned in Escherichia coli has been determined using the Maxam and Gilbert method and the dideoxynucleotide method. This sequence is 3,182 nucleotides long. Location of the nonsense codons shows that the coding capacity of the L chain is larger than the coding capacity of the Schain. Eight open regions, able to code for polypeptide chains larger than 100 amino acids, have been located. Region 6, which is the largest, covers more than 80% of the genome. The gene S which codes for polypeptide I of the Hbs Ag and was previously located between coordinates 95.1 and 73.6 is contained in region 7."

https://openalex.org/W1998560439,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the transposon Tn3 and of 20 mutations which affect its transposition are reported. The mutations, generated in vitro by random insertion of synthetic restriction sites, proved to contain small duplications or deletions immediately adjacent to the new restriction site. By determining the phenotype and DNA sequence of these mutations we were able to generate an overlapping phenotypic and nucleotide map. This 4957 bp transposon encodes three polypeptides which account for all but 350 bp of its total coding capacity. These proteins are the transposase, a high molecular weight polypeptide (1015 amino acids) encoded by the tnpA gene; the Tn3-specific repressor, a low molecular weight polypeptide (185 amino acids) encoded by the tnpR gene; and the 286 amino acid beta-lactamase. The 38 bp inverted repeats flanking Tn3 appear to be absolutely required in cis for Tn3 to transpose. Genetic data suggest that Tn3 contains a third site (Gill et al., 1978), designated IRS (internal resolution site), whose absence results in the insertion of two complete copies of Tn3 as direct repeats into the recipient DNA. We suggest that these direct repeats of complete copies of Tn3 are intermediates in transposition, and that the IRS site is required for recombination and subsequent segregation of the direct repeats to leave a single copy of Tn3 (Gill et al., 1978). A 23 nucleotide sequence within the amino terminus of the transposase which shares strong sequence homology with the inverted repeat may be the internal resolution site."
https://openalex.org/W2036571146,"Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis has revealed that vimentin, the predominant subunit of intermediate filaments in cells of mesenchymal origin, is a component of isolated skeletal myofibrils. It thus coexists in mature muscle fibers with desmin, the major subunit of muscle intermediate filaments. Antisera to desmin and vimentin, shown to be specific for their respective antigens by two-dimensional immunoautoradiography, have been used in immunofluorescence to demonstrate that vimentin has the same distribution as desmin in skeletal muscle. Both desmin and vimentin surround each myofibril Z disc and form honeycomb-like networks within each Z plane of the muscle fiber. This distribution is complementary to that of alpha-actinin within a given Z plane. Desmin and vimentin may thus be involved in maintaining the lateral registration of sarcomeres by transversely linking adjacent myofibrils at their Z discs. This linkage would support and integrate the fiber as a whole, and provide a molecular basis for the cross-striated appearance of skeletal muscle."

The oscillations displayed a period averaging 9 minutes. The amplitudes for insulin and glucagon were ten and five times greater than for glucose. Insulin cycled in and glucagon out of phase with glucose. In baboons, oscillations of glucose and insulin were smaller than in rhesus monkeys, while in man, regular oscillations were not observed."

https://openalex.org/W2073635911,"Three-dimensional reconstructions of islets of Langerhans, based on immunofluorescent staining of successive serial sections with antiserums to insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide reveal a marked difference in the number of cells containing glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide depending on the anatomical location of the islet in the pancreas. The two types of islets are situated in regions of exocrine tissue that are drained by different excretory ducts. This demonstration contradicts the assumption that all islets in the pancreas are similar in their endocrine cell content."
https://openalex.org/W2072359314,"Radioactive alpha factor is degraded to discrete biologically inactive fragments by the target a cells of S. cerevisiae, but not by alpha cells which make the pheromone. The pattern of cleavage products and sequence analysis of one fragment indicated that the first scission occurred between leucine 6 and lysine 7. The protease inhibitors tosyl-L-argininyl-methyl ester (TAME), tosyl-L-lysyl-chloromethylketone (TLCK) and N-acetyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-argininal (leupeptin) markedly prolonged the period of G1 arrest in a cells exposed to alpha factor, while other standard protease inhibitors had little or no effect. The presence of TAME and leupeptin, or TLCK, reduced the rate of degradation of radioactively labeled alpha factor by a cells. Intact yeast cells have apparent esterase and amidase activities that are blocked by the same spectrum of inhibitors that potentiate alpha factor action. Purified alpha factor is a competitive inhibitor of these hydrolytic activities. The activities are present in yeast mutants which have greatly reduced levels of the three major vacuole-associated proteases (A, B and C) or which carry an ochre mutation in the major neutral protease (B). These observations indicate that the inactivation of alpha factor is due to endoproteolytic cleavage, the destruction of the pheromone is required to overcome its effects on growth and that degradation of the molecule may involve surface bound endopeptidase(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1963803071,"The outer membrane lipoprotein is the most abundant protein in an E. coli cell. Its structural gene (Ipp) was cloned into a lambda phage vector and the nucleotide sequence of a DNA fragment of 814 bp encompassing the Ipp gene was determined. The promoter region of the gene was found to have the following features. First, a segment of 261 bp preceding the transcription initiation site (-1 to -261) has a very high AT content of 70%, in contrast to 53% for the mRNA region of 322 bp, 44% for a segment of 127 bp after the transcription termination site and 49% for the average AT content of the E. coli chromosome. Second, in particular, of the first 45 bp upstream from the transcription initiation site (-1 to -45), 36 bases (80%) are A or T. Third, there is a heptanucleotide sequence homologous to the ""Pribnow box,"" eight bases apart from the transcription initiation site. Fourth, a sequence homologous to the ""RNA polymerase recognition site"" exists on both strands between positions -27 and -39. Finally, there is a long dyad symmetry centered at the transcription initiation site."
https://openalex.org/W2039115551,"Oral administration of quercitrin, an inhibitor of aldose reductase, leads to a significant decrease in the accumulation of sorbitol in the lens of diabetic Octodon degus. The onset of cataract is effectively delayed when quercitrin is continuously administered. Thus in these diabetic animals, as in galactosemic rats, the use of an effective aldose reductase inhibitor impedes the course of cataract development. These observations support the hypothesis that in diabetes, as in galactosemia, aldose reductase plays a key role in initiating the formation of lens opacity."

https://openalex.org/W2082102231,"The addition of Ser AGC AGU tRNA to an E. coli cell-free protein synthesizing system which contains the endogenous tRNA levels results in up to 100% of the ribosomes translating the MS2 coat gene shifting into the -1 reading frame. An analogous phenomenon is seen at a much lower level without the tRNA addition, where a shift into the +1 frame can also be detected. Thus translation with the endogenous tRNA levels yields proteins which have the amino terminus of the coat protein but which are substantially larger than the coat protein and comprise about 5% of the coat translation. Since the lysis gene overlaps the 3' end of the coat gene in the +1 frame, we conclude that the reading frame shift into the +1 frame yields a hybrid protein. Also, we present evidence that ribosomes translating the synthetase gene shift into the -1 frame near the distal end of the gene. This frameshifting is promoted by thrACU ACC tRNA. Specific competitor tRNAs for both Thr and Ser tRNA-promoted frameshifting have been characterized. The generality of this new mechanism for producing additional proteins is unclear, but it investigation should increase understanding of the coding mechanism and its origin."
https://openalex.org/W1565636616,"Tetanus toxin was digested with papain, yielding one major polypeptide (Fragment C) with a molecular weight corresponding to 47,000 +/- 5%, thus comprising about one-third of the toxin molecule. Fragment C was antigenically active, atoxic, and stimulated the formation of antibodies neutralizing the lethal action of tetanus toxin in vivo. Furthermore, a second split product (Fragment B) was isolated from the papain digest, containing two polypeptide chains linked together via a disulfide bond. Fragment B (Mr = 95,000 +/- 5%) was atoxic and showed a reaction of nonidentity with Fragment C on immunodiffusion analysis against tetanus antitoxin. The basic two-chain structure (heavy and light chain polypeptide, cf. Matsuda, M., and Yoneda, M. (1975) Infect. Immun. 12, 1147-1153) of tetanus toxin has been confirmed and the relationship between Fragments B and C within this framework has been established. Fragment C was distinguished from the light chain by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and by immunodiffusion analysis, indicating that this fragment constitutes a portion of the heavy chain polypeptide. Fragment B showed a reaction of partial identity with the light as well as the heavy chain from tetanus toxin. Reduction of Fragment B with dithiothreitol followed by gel chromatography yielded a fraction which was indistinguishable from the light chain portion of the toxin molecule. It is concluded that Fragment B comprises the complementary portion of the heavy chain (remaining after scission of the polypeptide bond(s) releasing Fragment C) linked to the light chain by a disulfide bond."

https://openalex.org/W1986210752,"Yeast mRNA enriched for ribosomal protein mRNA was obtained by isolating poly(A)+ small mRNA from small polysomes. A comparison of cell-free translation of this small mRNA and total mRNA, and electrophoresis of the products on two-dimensional gels which resolve most yeast ribosomal proteins, demonstrated that a 5-10 fold enrichment for ribosomal protein mRNA was obtained. One hundred different recombinant DNA molecules possibly containing ribosomal protein genes were selected by differential colony hybridization of this enriched mRNA and unfractionated mRNA to a bank of yeast pMB9 hybrid plasmids. After screening twenty-five of these candidates, five different clones were found which contain yeast ribosomal protein gene sequences. The yeast mRNAs complementary to these five plasmids code for 35S-methionine-labeled polypeptides which co-migrate on two-dimensional gels with yeast ribosomal proteins. Consistent with previous studies on ribosomal protein mRNAs, the amounts of mRNA complementary to three of these cloned genes are controlled by the RNA2 locus. Although two of the five clones contain more than one yeast gene, none contain more than one identifiable ribosomal protein gene. Thus there is no evidence for ""tight"" linkage of yeast ribosomal protein genes. Two of the cloned ribosomal protein genes are single-copy genes, whereas two other cloned sequences contain two different copies of the same ribosomal protein gene. The fifth plasmid contains sequences which are repeated in the yeast genome, but it is not known whether any or all of the ribosomal protein gene on this clone contains repetitive DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1516368712,"The pathway of anaerobic reduction of nitrite to nitrogen gas (N2) by cell suspensions of the denitrifier, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was studied using the techniques of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. While release of nitrous oxide (N2O) is not normally detected during the reduction of nitrite to N2 by this organism, 15N from [15N]nitrite nevertheless can be trapped quantitatively as 15N2O in a pool of added N2O. In such experiments the abundance of 15N in N2O always exceeds that in product N2, consistent with the absence of a major reductive route from nitrite to N2 which by-passes N2O. During the reduction of a mixture of [15N]nitrite and nitric oxide (NO), 15NO produced at most only in trace amounts. The final products are chiefly 15N2 and 14N2 with only a small fraction of the scrambled product, 14N15N. Much of the 14N15N can be accounted for as an artifact caused by traces of molecular oxygen, which promote the conversion of NO to nitrite by autooxidation and thereby degrade slightly the isotopic purity of [15N]nitrite. Nitrous oxide shows all the properties of a free obligatory intermediate during the denitrification of nitrite to N2 by P. aeruginosa, whereas NO does not. The inability to trap 15NO in a pool of NO indicates that NO is not a free obligatory intermediate in the reduction of nitrite. The small mole fractions of 14N15N produced from a mixture of [15N]nitrite and NO require that the main reductive pathways for these nitrogen oxides cannot share any freely diffusible mono-nitrogen intermediate in common. The simplest interpretation is that nitrite and NO are denitrified by separate pathways, at least prior to the formation of the first bi-nitrogen compound."
https://openalex.org/W1562094939,"Abstract Incubation of fat cells with insulin increased glycogen synthase I activity without changing total synthase activity. This effect of insulin was dependent upon the particular lot of albumin present in the medium and was abolished by incubating cells with trypsin. Half-maximal activation of glycogen synthase was obtained with 8 microunits/ml of insulin, a concentration very similar to that which half-maximally stimulated 3-O-methylglucose uptake. The basal percentage of phosphorylase a activity was not detectably altered by insulin, although it was decreased by incubating cells with 5 mM glucose. Insulin (50 microunits/ml) markedly opposed actions of epinephrine (0.05 to 10 muM) to increase phosphorylase a activity and decrease glycogen synthase I activity, effects which were observed without glucose. Partial activation of glycogen synthase by insulin was seen after 1 min and complete activation after 4 min. Glucose alone produced a transient increase in synthase I activity. When cells were incubated with insulin plus glucose for 4 min, the increase in the percent synthase I activity was much greater than the additive effects of insulin and glucose alone. This potentiation of the effect of insulin on glucogen synthase I activity depended on the time of incubation with glucose and on the concentration of the hexose. If cells were incubated with cytochalasin B before insulin plus glucose, the effect of glucose was abolished. These results suggest that there are at least two mechanisms by which insulin can increase fat cell glycogen synthase I activity. One requires glucose and activation occurs secondary to an increase in glucose transport; where another mechanism(s) is operative even in the absence of glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1973337083,"The transcription of transfer RNA genes (tDNAs) and processing of the transcripts have been studied by injecting cloned tDNAs into Xenopus oocyte nuclei. Three main conclusions can be drawn. First, eucaryotic nuclear tRNA genes, but neither procaryotic nor mitochondrial tRNA genes, are expressed in injected oocytes. While both nematode and yeast tDNAS direct the synthesis of authentic tRNAs, neither E. coli tDNA nor human mitochondrial tDNAs support the synthesis of defined tRNAs when injected into oocytes. Second, competition experiments with co-injected 5S genes and inhibition experiments with alpha-amanitin show that injected tDNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase III. Third, oocytes injected with a nematode tDNA synthesize a tRNA precursor which is processed post-transcriptionally by removal of a 5' leader sequence. This precursor is found exclusively in the nucleus and is processed in the nucleus before the mature tRNA enters the cytoplasm."

https://openalex.org/W2082176738,"Abstract Degranulation of azurophil and specific granules after phagocytic challenge with E. coli for 5 sec to 10 min was investigated in the human polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN). PMN were stained simultaneously with fluorescein and rhodamine-labeled monospecific antisera to myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lactoferrin (LF) to identify azurophil and specific granules, respectively, within single cells. Fixation was designed to preserve or disrupt differential permeability of cell membrane to fluorescent conjugates in order to study granule translocation. Within 5 sec after phagocytic challenge, MPO and LF appeared on the cell surface coating the bacteria as granule contents leaked from the incompletely formed phagolysosomes. The phagocytic cup, shown by scanning electron microscopy as large and circular, appeared by immunofluorescent markers to be outlined by curvilinear staining for both granule markers, and was always coincident with bacterial localization. MPO and LF appeared singly or simultaneously on the cell surface, suggesting that degranulation to the surface was random. Sequential phagocytic events were demonstrated by comparing staining intensities for each granule marker on the surface and intracellularly within single cells. LF sometimes appeared on the cell surface independent of the nascent phagosome, suggesting that perturbation of the cell membrane by bacteria may cause some specific granule extrusion not limited to the phagosome. These results imply that bacteria make contact with granule-associated anti-microbial substances within 5 sec after phagocytosis is initiated and that free communication of granule constituents occurs between the newly forming phagolysosome and the extracellular space."
https://openalex.org/W1480005617,"The development of sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes was studied in vivo and in tissue culture in chicken pectoralis muscle cells. The concentration of the calcium- and magnesium-activated ATPase measured by selective labeling of the enzyme with [32P]ATP in whole muscle homogenates was found to increase in developing chicken pectoralis muscle in vivo from 0.01 nmol/mg of protein in 12-day embryos to 0.3 to 0.4 nmol/mg of protein in 1-month-old chicks, where it constitutes about 3% of the total protein content of muscle. In cultured muscle cells the concentration of calcium-sensitive phosphoprotein increased from 0.015 nmol/mg of protein at 2 days to 0.04 to 0.05 nmol/mg of protein after 5 days of culture. This amount represents about 0.5% of the protein content of the muscle cells. The accumulation of Ca2+ transport ATPase began during fusion and continued with a linear rate during 8 days of culture. The density of 75 A intramembranous particles seen by freeze-etch electron microscopy on fracture faces of sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes is about 4,000/mum2 in adult chick pectoralis muscle but only 400/mum2 in cultured muscle cells in rough proportion to the concentration of Ca2+-sensitive phosphoprotein. The Ca2+, Na+, and K+ concentration of the medium and addition of ouabain, caffeine, or the calcium ionophores A23187 and X537A sharply influence the concentration of calcium transport ATPase in cultured muscle cells, parallel with their effect upon cell fusion and growth. These observations are consistent with the proposition that the gene expression leading to the accumulation of Ca2+ transport ATPase during development in culture may be regulated by intracellular ion concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W1577024431,"An immunochemical assay for tubulin subunits is described. The method is applied directly to homogenates of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate (Na dodecyl-SO4), and it makes use of a two-dimensional electrophoresis system; the first separation is carried out by Na dodecyl-SO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the second by electrophoresis into an agarose gel containing antibodies. Tubulin is precipitated in the form of a rocket and the method is made quantitative through the use of cells labeled with [35S]sulfate. The antiserum used in this assay was prepared in rabbits using beta subunit of tubulin purified from Chlamydomonas flagella by two preparative Na dodecyl-SO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses. This antiserum and an antiserum to alpha subunit of tubulin from porcine brain, prepared for comparative study, were extensively characterized. Both antisera show specificity for the polypeptide used as antigen and react with the native dimeric tubulin. The antiserum to beta subunit from Chlamydomonas flagella also forms immunoprecipitates with native brain tubulin and its beta subunit when used at high titer. In contrast, the antiserum to alpha subunit from porcine brain does not cross-react with Chlamydomonas tubulin. The immunochemical assay was applied to Chlamydomonas cells synchronized by a 12-h light/dark cycle. In cells collected during the light period (late G1), after removal of flagella, the content of tubulin is estimated to be 0.3% of total protein. As cells enter the dark period there is a striking increase in tubulin content which reaches a maximum just before cell division."

The mutant (ts710) temperature-sensitive period irreversibly affected the middle and late stages of sporulation. Mutant cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature exhibited abnormal serine protease accumulation, serine esterase accumulation, alkaline phosphatase accumulation, RNA polymerase template specificity changes, and pulse-labeled RNA synthesis profiles.

The protein was purified approximately 2,000-fold with relatively proportional recoveries of all four enzyme activities. The purified material was homogeneous by the criteria of analytical disc gel electrophoresis and gel isoelectric focusing. Disc gel electrophoresis after denaturation with sodium dodecyl sulfate gave a single protein band with a molecular weight of 155,000 +/- 5,000. Disc gel electrophoresis in 8 M urea also gave rise to a single protein band. We interpret these results as evidence for a single species of subunit. The pathway in Euglena is the only one known to the present in which the terminal enzyme, tryptophan synthase, is not a separate molecular species."

https://openalex.org/W1568895320,"Initial velocity studies and product inhibition patterns for purine nucleoside phosphorylase from rabbit liver were examined in order to determine the predominant catalytic mechanism for the synthetic (forward) and phosphorolytic (reverse) reactions of the enzyme. Initial velocity studies in the absence of products gave intersecting or converging linear double reciprocal plots of the kinetic data for both the synthetic and phosphorolytic reactions of the enzyme. The observed kinetic pattern was consistent with a sequential mechanism, requiring that both substrates add to the enzyme before products may be released. The product inhibition patterns showed mutual competitive inhibition between guanine and guanosine as variable substrates and inhibitors. Ribose 1-phosphate and inorganic orthophosphate were also mutually competitive toward each other. Other combinations of substrates and products gave noncompetitive inhibition. Apparent inhibition constants calculated for guanine as competitive inhibitor and for ribose 1-phosphate as noncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme, with guanosine as variable substrate, did not vary significantly with increasing concentrations of inorganic orthophosphate as fixed substrate. These results suggest that the mechanism was order and that substrates add to the enzyme in an obligatory order. Dead end inhibition studies carried out in the presence of the products guanine and ribose 1-phosphate, respectively, showed that the kinetically significant abortive ternary complexes of enzyme-guanine-inorganic orthophosphate (EQB) and enzyme-guanose-ribose 1-phosphate (EAP) are formed. The results of dead end inhibition studies are consistent with an obligatory order of substrate addition to the enzyme. The nucleoside or purine is probably the first substrate to form a binary complex with the enzyme, and with which inorganic orthophosphate or ribose 1-phosphate may interact as secondary substrates. The evidences presented in this investigation support an Ordered Theorell-Chance mechanism for the enzyme."

For both promoters, strains with the hybrid plasmid accumulated a small RNA species not present in strains carrying the vector. These RNAs were analyzed by RNA sequencing techniques and compared to DNA sequences. In both cases, synthesis of the new RNA species is initiated by the cloned r protein promoter at the site predicted by previous in vitro experiments. The RNAs extend across the Hind II site used for cloning and terminate specifically in the vector sequences. The termination site was localized to six consecutive thymine nucleotides preceded by a sequence with dyad symmetry. We found that the RNA from the str promoter was 205 (+/- 3) nucleotides long and that from the spc promoter was 177 (+/- 3) nucleotides long. These ""hybrid mRNAs"" are much more stable than ordinary mRNA. The str hybrid mRNA has a half-life of about 8 min, and the spc hybrid mRNA has a half-life of about 18 min at 37 degrees C.
