https://openalex.org/W2014668554,"Ocular lesions have been experimentally produced in rabbit by a pulsed optical maser (laser). The high-energy density delivered in a single 0.5 msec pulse was sufficient to cause instantaneous thermal injury to the pigmented retina and iris of the brown rabbit. Ophthalmoscopically, the retinal lesions resembled flash burns from an atomic fireball."

They have been interpreted as being the etiologic agent of this disease. The particles were present in association with, in some cases within, vesicles of the endoplasmic reticulum of intestinal epithelial cells. They were never seen in the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W1967371027,Differential blocking of conduction in mammalian nerve fibers has been produced by irradiation of the whole nerve with focused ultrasound. The smallest (C) fibers are the most sensitive; the largest (A-alpha) fibers are the least vulnerable. Fully reversible blocking can be obtained with carefully graded doses of ultrasound.

Confirmation of this finding has been obtained by a different approach. Working with injected doses of radioactive vitamin B12 in the range 50–1,000 µg, a linear relationship with a coefficient of correlation differing significantly from zero was found between the logarithm of the amount of injected vitamin B12 retained in the body and the time in days for the serum vitamin B12 level to fall to the pre-injection level, the lower limit of normal, in patients with pernicious anæmia2. The regression equation was Y= 17.0886x − 0.4270 when Y = the time in days and x = the logarithm of the retained dose. From this information it can be calculated that the biological half-life in the plasma of the radioactive vitamin B12 retained in the body was 5.14 days and that the velocity constant (k) is 0.1347 days−1. The closeness of the estimates is satisfying particularly as they were obtained by totally different experimental methods. The short biological half-life in plasma contrasts sharply with that in the liver, which has been calculated to average about 12 months."

https://openalex.org/W1500968306,"After the oral administration of nicotinamide to human subjects, two ultraviolet-absorbing compounds have regularly been detected on chromatograms of plasma extracts. The less polar of these, named Compound Y, has been identified as N’-methyl2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (1). In the present communication, evidence is presented that the more polar metabolite, Compound X, is N’-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide.1"

https://openalex.org/W2074860975,"BY the use of DEAE-cellulose chromatography, we have endeavoured to obtain in their pure form various factors developed by adenoviruses during their propagation in tissue culture cells1–4. HeLa or human amnion cells were inoculated with adenoviruses of types 1, 2, 3, 5, 7a, 9, 10, 11 and 15. On the 3rd–5th day the culture fluids were collected and were dialysed against 0.005 M borate buffer solution, pH 8.10. The dialysed fluid was then introduced into a DEAE-cellulose column (1 cm. diam., 10 cm. high) which was previously balanced by 0.005 M borate buffer solution, pH 8.10. Fractionation was carried out by adding 0.005 M borate buffer solution, pH. 8.10, containing sodium chloride, to the column in linearly increasing concentrations of 0–0.8 M. 5-ml. fractions were collected and analysed with the view of detecting haemagglutinins (by the reaction of haemagglutination with the erythrocytes of rats and monkeys), also an early cytopathogenic factor5,6, the complement-fixing antigen and an infectious virus."

https://openalex.org/W2073078986,"GALACTOSE, a stereoisomer of glucose which is not metabolized by peripheral tissues1,2, is transported in the isolated perfused rat heart by an insulin-sensitive carrier mechanism2. The effect of insulin, which is to increase markedly the rate of movement of the sugar across the muscle cell membrane, is most clearly demonstrated in the efflux of the sugar from the tissue. Hearts loaded with galactose by perfusion for 20 min. with a Krebs–bicarbonate medium containing the hexose (1 gm./100 ml.) are transferred to a sugar-free perfusate, and the effluent collected in a timed sample. The fractional fall in the heart galactose content during the fourth minute after transfer is used as a measure of efflux-rate. It has been shown3 that the dose-response curves of rate of galactose efflux against insulin concentration show a marked seasonal variation; the sensitivity being greatest in summer and least in winter (Fig. 1). The dose-response curves are Michaelis–Menten in form; and the change with season suggests the presence of a competitive inhibitor of insulin during the winter months."

https://openalex.org/W2089644640,"IN the past few years several methods have been proposed for the removal of radiostrontium from milk. Among the most elaborate methods is a procedure worked out by Migicovsky1and further improved by L. F. Emondson et al.2. This method is based on an ion-exchange process using a bed of resin charged with a mixed solution of calcium, potassium, sodium, and magnesium ions. In pilot plant experiments this process has proved able to remove about 90 per cent of the radiostrontium present in milk."

So far as we know there is no information available in the literature dealing with the mucoid content of micro-organisms; therefore, we were interested to apply the same method previously used by us2, for animal tissues, to the study of some bacteria and fungi."
