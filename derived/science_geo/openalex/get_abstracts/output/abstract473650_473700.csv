https://openalex.org/W2163410184,"In this Resource study, the authors used Direct RNA Sequencing (DRS) to quantitatively examine the transcriptional profile of microglia, focusing specifically on the proteins important for binding endogenous ligands and potential pathogens—a collection they term the 'sensome'. They also compare this profile to that of peripheral macrophages. Microglia, the principal neuroimmune sentinels of the brain, continuously sense changes in their environment and respond to invading pathogens, toxins and cellular debris. Microglia exhibit plasticity and can assume neurotoxic or neuroprotective priming states that determine their responses to danger. We used direct RNA sequencing, without amplification or cDNA synthesis, to determine the quantitative transcriptomes of microglia of healthy adult and aged mice. We validated our findings using fluorescence dual in situ hybridization, unbiased proteomic analysis and quantitative PCR. We found that microglia have a distinct transcriptomic signature and express a unique cluster of transcripts encoding proteins for sensing endogenous ligands and microbes that we refer to as the sensome. With aging, sensome transcripts for endogenous ligand recognition were downregulated, whereas those involved in microbe recognition and host defense were upregulated. In addition, aging was associated with an overall increase in the expression of microglial genes involved in neuroprotection."

(p. 468 ) studied 17.9 million research articles across five decades of the Web of Science, the largest repository of scientific research. Scientific work typically appeared to draw on highly conventional, familiar mixtures of knowledge. The highest-impact papers were not the ones that had the greatest novelty, but had a combination of novelty and otherwise conventional combinations of prior work."
https://openalex.org/W2056155872,"Adrienne Flanagan and colleagues identify distinct driver mutations in H3F3A and H3F3B in chondroblastoma and giant cell tumor of bone. The mutations occur in over 90% of tumors and exhibit a high degree of tumor type specificity. It is recognized that some mutated cancer genes contribute to the development of many cancer types, whereas others are cancer type specific. For genes that are mutated in multiple cancer classes, mutations are usually similar in the different affected cancer types. Here, however, we report exquisite tumor type specificity for different histone H3.3 driver alterations. In 73 of 77 cases of chondroblastoma (95%), we found p.Lys36Met alterations predominantly encoded in H3F3B, which is one of two genes for histone H3.3. In contrast, in 92% (49/53) of giant cell tumors of bone, we found histone H3.3 alterations exclusively in H3F3A, leading to p.Gly34Trp or, in one case, p.Gly34Leu alterations. The mutations were restricted to the stromal cell population and were not detected in osteoclasts or their precursors. In the context of previously reported H3F3A mutations encoding p.Lys27Met and p.Gly34Arg or p.Gly34Val alterations in childhood brain tumors, a remarkable picture of tumor type specificity for histone H3.3 driver alterations emerges, indicating that histone H3.3 residues, mutations and genes have distinct functions."
https://openalex.org/W1975784282,We identified new gene fusions in patients with lung cancer harboring the kinase domain of the NTRK1 gene that encodes the high-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (TRKA protein). Both the MPRIP-NTRK1 and CD74-NTRK1 fusions lead to constitutive TRKA kinase activity and are oncogenic. Treatment of cells expressing NTRK1 fusions with inhibitors of TRKA kinase activity inhibited autophosphorylation of TRKA and cell growth. Tumor samples from 3 of 91 patients with lung cancer (3.3%) without known oncogenic alterations assayed by next-generation sequencing or fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated evidence of NTRK1 gene fusions.
https://openalex.org/W1971638449,"The basal forebrain provides the primary source of cholinergic input to the cortex, and it has a crucial function in promoting wakefulness and arousal. However, whether rapid changes in basal forebrain neuron spiking in awake animals can dynamically influence sensory perception is unclear. Here we show that basal forebrain cholinergic neurons rapidly regulate cortical activity and visual perception in awake, behaving mice. Optogenetic activation of the cholinergic neurons or their V1 axon terminals improved performance of a visual discrimination task on a trial-by-trial basis. In V1, basal forebrain activation enhanced visual responses and desynchronized neuronal spiking; these changes could partly account for the behavioral improvement. Conversely, optogenetic basal forebrain inactivation decreased behavioral performance, synchronized cortical activity and impaired visual responses, indicating the importance of cholinergic activity in normal visual processing. These results underscore the causal role of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in fast, bidirectional modulation of cortical processing and sensory perception."

https://openalex.org/W2163472474,"In patients, non-proliferative disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) can persist in the bone marrow (BM) while other organs (such as lung) present growing metastasis. This suggested that the BM might be a metastasis ‘restrictive soil’ by encoding dormancy-inducing cues in DTCs. Here we show in a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) model that strong and specific transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) signalling in the BM activates the MAPK p38α/β, inducing an (ERK/p38)low signalling ratio. This results in induction of DEC2/SHARP1 and p27, downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and dormancy of malignant DTCs. TGF-β2-induced dormancy required TGF-β receptor-I (TGF-β-RI), TGF-β-RIII and SMAD1/5 activation to induce p27. In lungs, a metastasis ‘permissive soil’ with low TGF-β2 levels, DTC dormancy was short-lived and followed by metastatic growth. Importantly, systemic inhibition of TGF-β-RI or p38α/β activities awakened dormant DTCs, fuelling multi-organ metastasis. Our work reveals a ‘seed and soil’ mechanism where TGF-β2 and TGF-β-RIII signalling through p38α/β regulates DTC dormancy and defines restrictive (BM) and permissive (lung) microenvironments for HNSCC metastasis. Aguirre-Ghiso and colleagues report that the intensity of TGF-β2 signalling dictates dormancy or metastatic growth of disseminated tumour cells by regulating the activity of p38α/β in different target organs."
https://openalex.org/W1972717887,"The Xist long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is essential for X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), the process by which mammals compensate for unequal numbers of sex chromosomes. During XCI, Xist coats the future inactive X chromosome (Xi) and recruits Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to the X-inactivation centre (Xic). How Xist spreads silencing on a 150-megabases scale is unclear. Here we generate high-resolution maps of Xist binding on the X chromosome across a developmental time course using CHART-seq. In female cells undergoing XCI de novo, Xist follows a two-step mechanism, initially targeting gene-rich islands before spreading to intervening gene-poor domains. Xist is depleted from genes that escape XCI but may concentrate near escapee boundaries. Xist binding is linearly proportional to PRC2 density and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), indicating co-migration of Xist and PRC2. Interestingly, when Xist is acutely stripped off from the Xi in post-XCI cells, Xist recovers quickly within both gene-rich and gene-poor domains on a timescale of hours instead of days, indicating a previously primed Xi chromatin state. We conclude that Xist spreading takes distinct stage-specific forms. During initial establishment, Xist follows a two-step mechanism, but during maintenance, Xist spreads rapidly to both gene-rich and gene-poor regions."

Neuronal dendrites are not passive cables, but whether their excitability contributes to computation at the cell's soma has been uncertain. Now Michael Häusser and colleagues have used patch-clamp recordings from dendrites of pyramidal cells in the visual cortex of awake mice to observe and interfere with dendritic 'spikes' during sensory stimulation. Their results demonstrate that active dendritic processing enhances somatic orientation selectivity, a fundamental brain computation. Neuronal dendrites are electrically excitable: they can generate regenerative events such as dendritic spikes in response to sufficiently strong synaptic input1,2,3. Although such events have been observed in many neuronal types4,5,6,7,8,9, it is not well understood how active dendrites contribute to the tuning of neuronal output in vivo. Here we show that dendritic spikes increase the selectivity of neuronal responses to the orientation of a visual stimulus (orientation tuning). We performed direct patch-clamp recordings from the dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the primary visual cortex of lightly anaesthetized and awake mice, during sensory processing. Visual stimulation triggered regenerative local dendritic spikes that were distinct from back-propagating action potentials. These events were orientation tuned and were suppressed by either hyperpolarization of membrane potential or intracellular blockade of NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors. Both of these manipulations also decreased the selectivity of subthreshold orientation tuning measured at the soma, thus linking dendritic regenerative events to somatic orientation tuning. Together, our results suggest that dendritic spikes that are triggered by visual input contribute to a fundamental cortical computation: enhancing orientation selectivity in the visual cortex. Thus, dendritic excitability is an essential component of behaviourally relevant computations in neurons."

Cui et al. (p. 460 ) designed a surfactant based on the association of a hydrophilic nanoparticle with a functionalized oleophilic molecule that self-assembles at a water-oil interface to produce a composite surfactant. Once adsorbed, the nanoparticles tend to remain in place causing them to accumulate and “jam” at the interface. When a drop was deformed, more surfactant could assemble at the surface, allowing droplets of various shapes to be produced."

https://openalex.org/W2000332539,Knowing when a physical system has reached sufficient size for its macroscopic properties to be well described by many-body theory is difficult. We investigate the crossover from few to many-body physics by studying quasi one-dimensional systems of ultracold atoms consisting of a single impurity interacting with an increasing number of identical fermions. We measure the interaction energy of such a system as a function of the number of majority atoms for different strengths of the interparticle interaction. As we increase the number of majority atoms one by one we observe the fast convergence of the normalized interaction energy towards a many-body limit calculated for a single impurity immersed in a Fermi sea of majority particles.
https://openalex.org/W1591773525,"Circadian oscillation of body temperature is a basic, evolutionarily conserved feature of mammalian biology. In addition, homeostatic pathways allow organisms to protect their core temperatures in response to cold exposure. However, the mechanism responsible for coordinating daily body temperature rhythm and adaptability to environmental challenges is unknown. Here we show that the nuclear receptor Rev-erbα (also known as Nr1d1), a powerful transcriptional repressor, links circadian and thermogenic networks through the regulation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) function. Mice exposed to cold fare considerably better at 05:00 (Zeitgeber time 22) when Rev-erbα is barely expressed than at 17:00 (Zeitgeber time 10) when Rev-erbα is abundant. Deletion of Rev-erbα markedly improves cold tolerance at 17:00, indicating that overcoming Rev-erbα-dependent repression is a fundamental feature of the thermogenic response to cold. Physiological induction of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) by cold temperatures is preceded by rapid downregulation of Rev-erbα in BAT. Rev-erbα represses Ucp1 in a brown-adipose-cell-autonomous manner and BAT Ucp1 levels are high in Rev-erbα-null mice, even at thermoneutrality. Genetic loss of Rev-erbα also abolishes normal rhythms of body temperature and BAT activity. Thus, Rev-erbα acts as a thermogenic focal point required for establishing and maintaining body temperature rhythm in a manner that is adaptable to environmental demands."

Like their normal hematopoietic stem cell counterparts, leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are presumed to reside in specific niches in the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM)1 and may be the cause of relapse following chemotherapy2. Targeting the niche is a new strategy to eliminate persistent and drug-resistant LSCs. CD44 (refs. 3,4) and interleukin-6 (ref. 5) have been implicated previously in the LSC niche. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is released during bone remodeling6 and plays a part in maintenance of CML LSCs7, but a role for TGF-β1 from the BMM has not been defined. Here, we show that alteration of the BMM by osteoblastic cell–specific activation of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor8,9 attenuates BCR-ABL1 oncogene–induced CML-like myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN)10 but enhances MLL-AF9 oncogene–induced AML11 in mouse transplantation models, possibly through opposing effects of increased TGF-β1 on the respective LSCs. PTH treatment caused a 15-fold decrease in LSCs in wild-type mice with CML-like MPN and reduced engraftment of immune-deficient mice with primary human CML cells. These results demonstrate that LSC niches in CML and AML are distinct and suggest that modulation of the BMM by PTH may be a feasible strategy to reduce LSCs, a prerequisite for the cure of CML."

https://openalex.org/W2113491029,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions as a critical regulator of cellular growth and metabolism by forming multi-component, yet functionally distinct complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2. Although mTORC2 has been implicated in mTORC1 activation, little is known about how mTORC2 is regulated. Here we report that phosphorylation of Sin1 at Thr 86 and Thr 398 suppresses mTORC2 kinase activity by dissociating Sin1 from mTORC2. Importantly, Sin1 phosphorylation, triggered by S6K or Akt, in a cellular context-dependent manner, inhibits not only insulin- or IGF-1-mediated, but also PDGF- or EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation by mTORC2, demonstrating a negative regulation of mTORC2 independent of IRS-1 and Grb10. Finally, a cancer-patient-derived Sin1-R81T mutation impairs Sin1 phosphorylation, leading to hyper-activation of mTORC2 by bypassing this negative regulation. Together, our results reveal a Sin1-phosphorylation-dependent mTORC2 regulation, providing a potential molecular mechanism by which mutations in the mTORC1-S6K-Sin1 signalling axis might cause aberrant hyper-activation of the mTORC2-Akt pathway, which facilitates tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2113416428,"Introduction The shape of the face is one of the most distinctive features among humans, and differences in facial morphology have substantial implications in areas such as social interaction, psychology, forensics, and clinical genetics. Craniofacial shape is highly heritable, including the normal spectrum of morphological variation as well as susceptibility to major craniofacial birth defects. In this study, we explored the role of transcriptional enhancers in the development of the craniofacial complex. Our study is based on the rationale that such enhancers, which can be hundreds of kilobases away from their target genes, regulate the spatial patterns, levels, and timing of gene expression in normal development. Methods To identify distant-acting enhancers active during craniofacial development, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation on embryonic mouse face tissue followed by sequencing to identify noncoding genome regions bound by the enhancer-associated p300 protein. We used LacZ reporter assays in transgenic mice and optical projection tomography (OPT) to determine three-dimensional expression patterns of a subset of these candidate enhancers. Last, we deleted three of the craniofacial enhancers from the mouse genome to assess their effect on gene expression and craniofacial morphology during development. Results We identified more than 4000 candidate enhancer sequences predicted to be active in the developing craniofacial complex. The majority of these sequences are at least partially conserved between humans and mice, and many are located in chromosomal regions associated with normal facial morphology or craniofacial birth defects. Characterization of more than 200 candidate enhancer sequences in transgenic mice revealed a remarkable spatial complexity of in vivo expression patterns. Targeted deletions of three craniofacial enhancers near genes with known roles in craniofacial development resulted in changes of expression of those genes as well as quantitatively subtle but definable alterations of craniofacial shape. Discussion Our analysis identifies enhancers that fine tune expression of genes during craniofacial development in mice. These results support that variation in the sequence or copy number of craniofacial enhancers may contribute to the spectrum of facial variation we find in human populations. Because many craniofacial enhancers are located in genome regions associated with craniofacial birth defects, such as clefts of the lip and palate, our results also offer a starting point for exploring the contribution of noncoding sequences to these disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1973401711,"Tau immunotherapy is effective in transgenic mice, but the mechanisms of Tau clearance are not well known. To this end, Tau antibody uptake was analyzed in brain slice cultures and primary neurons. Internalization was rapid (<1 h), saturable, and substantial compared with control mouse IgG. Furthermore, temperature reduction to 4 °C, an excess of unlabeled mouse IgG, or an excess of Tau antibodies reduced uptake in slices by 63, 41, and 62%, respectively (p = 0.002, 0.04, and 0.005). Uptake strongly correlated with total and insoluble Tau levels (r(2) = 0.77 and 0.87 and p = 0.002 and 0.0002), suggesting that Tau aggregates influence antibody internalization and/or retention within neurons. Inhibiting phagocytosis did not reduce uptake in slices or neuronal cultures, indicating limited microglial involvement. In contrast, clathrin-specific inhibitors reduced uptake in neurons (≤ 78%, p < 0.0001) and slices (≤ 35%, p = 0.03), demonstrating receptor-mediated endocytosis as the primary uptake pathway. Fluid phase endocytosis accounted for the remainder of antibody uptake in primary neurons, based on co-staining with internalized dextran. The receptor-mediated uptake is to a large extent via low affinity FcγII/III receptors and can be blocked in slices (43%, p = 0.04) and neurons (53%, p = 0.008) with an antibody against these receptors. Importantly, antibody internalization appears to be necessary for Tau reduction in primary neurons. Overall, these findings clarify that Tau antibody uptake is primarily receptor-mediated, that these antibodies are mainly found in neurons with Tau aggregates, and that their intracellular interaction leads to clearance of Tau pathology, all of which have major implications for therapeutic development of this approach."
https://openalex.org/W2003676289,"Integrins have a critical role in thrombosis and haemostasis. Antagonists of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 are potent anti-thrombotic drugs, but also have the life-threatening adverse effect of causing bleeding. It is therefore desirable to develop new antagonists that do not cause bleeding. Integrins transmit signals bidirectionally. Inside-out signalling activates integrins through a talin-dependent mechanism. Integrin ligation mediates thrombus formation and outside-in signalling, which requires Gα13 and greatly expands thrombi. Here we show that Gα13 and talin bind to mutually exclusive but distinct sites within the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain in opposing waves. The first talin-binding wave mediates inside-out signalling and also ligand-induced integrin activation, but is not required for outside-in signalling. Integrin ligation induces transient talin dissociation and Gα13 binding to an EXE motif (in which X denotes any residue), which selectively mediates outside-in signalling and platelet spreading. The second talin-binding wave is associated with clot retraction. An EXE-motif-based inhibitor of Gα13-integrin interaction selectively abolishes outside-in signalling without affecting integrin ligation, and suppresses occlusive arterial thrombosis without affecting bleeding time. Thus, we have discovered a new mechanism for the directional switch of integrin signalling and, on the basis of this mechanism, designed a potent new anti-thrombotic drug that does not cause bleeding."
https://openalex.org/W1981149424,"The neurodegeneration found in human ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is caused by mutations in the ATM (A-T mutated) gene. Li et al. have identified the polycomb group protein with histone methyltransferase activity called EZH2 as a target of the ATM kinase. The study shows that ATM deficiency increases EZH2 stability, thus increasing methylated histone marks. This results in epigenetic changes in transcription that compromise the health and survival of CNS neurons. The symptoms of ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) include a progressive neurodegeneration caused by ATM protein deficiency. We previously found that nuclear accumulation of histone deacetylase-4, HDAC4, contributes to this degeneration; we now report that increased trimethylation of histone H3 on Lys27 (H3K27me3) mediated by polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is also important in the A-T phenotype. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a core catalytic component of PRC2, is a new ATM kinase target, and ATM-mediated phosphorylation of EZH2 on Ser734 reduces protein stability. Thus, PRC2 formation is elevated along with H3K27me3 in ATM deficiency. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing showed an increase in H3K27me3 'marks' and a dramatic shift in their location. The change of H3K27me3 chromatin-binding pattern is directly related to cell cycle reentry and cell death of ATM-deficient neurons. Lentiviral knockdown of EZH2 rescued Purkinje cell degeneration and behavioral abnormalities in Atm−/− mice, demonstrating that EZH2 hyperactivity is another key factor in A-T neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2049060336,"Flavoproteins catalyse a diversity of fundamental redox reactions and are one of the most studied enzyme families. As monooxygenases, they are universally thought to control oxygenation by means of a peroxyflavin species that transfers a single atom of molecular oxygen to an organic substrate. Here we report that the bacterial flavoenzyme EncM catalyses the peroxyflavin-independent oxygenation-dehydrogenation dual oxidation of a highly reactive poly(β-carbonyl). The crystal structure of EncM with bound substrate mimics and isotope labelling studies reveal previously unknown flavin redox biochemistry. We show that EncM maintains an unexpected stable flavin-oxygenating species, proposed to be a flavin-N5-oxide, to promote substrate oxidation and trigger a rare Favorskii-type rearrangement that is central to the biosynthesis of the antibiotic enterocin. This work provides new insight into the fine-tuning of the flavin cofactor in offsetting the innate reactivity of a polyketide substrate to direct its efficient electrocyclization."

A co-culture system that mimics the microenvironment of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in bone marrow enables the discovery of compounds, including lovastatin, that selectively kill LSCs. Efforts to develop more effective therapies for acute leukemia may benefit from high-throughput screening systems that reflect the complex physiology of the disease, including leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and supportive interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment. The therapeutic targeting of LSCs is challenging because LSCs are highly similar to normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and are protected by stromal cells in vivo. We screened 14,718 compounds in a leukemia-stroma co-culture system for inhibition of cobblestone formation, a cellular behavior associated with stem-cell function. Among those compounds that inhibited malignant cells but spared HSPCs was the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin. Lovastatin showed anti-LSC activity in vitro and in an in vivo bone marrow transplantation model. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the effect was on target, via inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase.

We propose a detailed reaction mechanism in which the radical SAM reaction, initiated at an N-terminal 4Fe-4S cluster, generates a tyrosine radical bound to a C-terminal 4Fe-4S cluster. Heterolytic cleavage of this tyrosine radical at the Cα-Cβ bond forms a transient 4-oxidobenzyl (4OB(•)) radical and a dehydroglycine bound to the C-terminal 4Fe-4S cluster.

Although glycolysis is one of the best understood pathways in the parasite, it is unclear if glucose metabolism appreciably contributes to the acetyl-CoA pools required for tricarboxylic acid metabolism (TCA) cycle and fatty acid biosynthesis. P. falciparum possesses a pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex that is localized to the apicoplast, a specialized quadruple membrane organelle, suggesting that separate acetyl-CoA pools are likely. Herein, we analyze PDH-deficient parasites using rapid stable-isotope labeling and show that PDH does not appreciably contribute to acetyl-CoA synthesis, tricarboxylic acid metabolism, or fatty acid synthesis in blood stage parasites. Rather, we find that acetyl-CoA demands are supplied through a “PDH-like” enzyme and provide evidence that the branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex is performing this function. We also show that acetyl-CoA synthetase can be a significant contributor to acetyl-CoA biosynthesis. Interestingly, the PDH-like pathway contributes glucose-derived acetyl-CoA to the TCA cycle in a stage-independent process, whereas anapleurotic carbon enters the TCA cycle via a stage-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase/phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase process that decreases as the parasite matures.

In Plasmodium, however, the PDH is localized within the apicoplast, a plastid-like organelle enclosed by four membranes (17Foth B.J. Stimmler L.M. Handman E. Crabb B.S. Hodder A.N. McFadden G.I.

PDH is a large multienzyme complex that converts pyruvate and co-enzyme A into acetyl-CoA using thiamine, NAD, and lipoic acid as cofactors. PDH is comprised of the E1 pyruvate dehydrogenase (which exists as a heteromer of E1α and E1β), E2 dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, and E3 dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase subunits (19Zhou Z.H. McCarthy D.B. O'Connor C.M. Reed L.J. Stoops J.K. The remarkable structural and functional organization of the eukaryotic pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14802-14807Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The E1 subunit mediates the covalent attachment of pyruvate to thiamine pyrophosphate, decarboxylating pyruvate to an acetyl group, and then transfers the acetyl group to lipoic acid. The acetyl group is then transferred to co-enzyme A (CoA) via the E2 subunit, and dihydrolipoic acid is oxidized back to lipoic acid by the E3 subunit. Because of its localization to the apicoplast in malaria parasites, the E3 subunit is not shared between other dehydrogenase complexes (17Foth B.J. Stimmler L.M. Handman E. Crabb B.S. Hodder A.N. McFadden G.I. The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has only one pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which is located in the apicoplast.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the rodent malaria Plasmodium yoelii, disrupting the E1α or E3 subunits of PDH has no effect on blood-stage development but prevents parasites from developing into liver-stage exo-erythrocytic merozoites (20Pei Y.

Because this phenotype is consistent with the fatty acid synthase II knock-out parasites, PDH is thought to be involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis during liver-stage development (17Foth B.J.

The catalytically active domain of the E2 subunit was demonstrated to have acetyl-CoA synthetic activity (17Foth B.J. Stimmler L.M. Handman E. Crabb B.S. Hodder A.N. McFadden G.I. The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has only one pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which is located in the apicoplast.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), but it has not been determined whether the PDH complex significantly contributes to acetyl-CoA metabolism or if it is essential for blood stages of the human malaria parasite P. falciparum. Herein, we have applied a rapid stable-isotope labeling technique in combination with high resolution mass spectrometry to study blood-stage acetyl-CoA metabolism and determine the contribution of the PDH to central carbon metabolism. In a comparative analysis of wild type versus PDH-deficient (pdh e1α-) parasites, we come to the surprising conclusion that the PDH does not appreciably contribute to the acetyl-CoA pool or metabolic pathways downstream of this central precursor. Moreover, we observe significant fluxes through acetyl-CoA-dependent pathways despite the absence of a functional PDH. We propose that acetyl-CoA is predominantly synthesized through the mitochondrial branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDH), an enzyme complex typically associated with amino acid degradation. We show that this PDH-like metabolism can account for the majority of acetyl-CoA synthesis and that direct synthesis of acetyl-CoA from acetate can also contribute to the acetyl-CoA pool when parasites are supplied with an abundant acetate source. These findings demonstrate that blood-stage parasites use a PDH-like enzyme and acetate fixation for supplying acetyl-CoA pools. To further investigate central carbon metabolism of P. falciparum, we measured the relative contribution of glucose- and glutamine-derived carbon to the TCA cycle throughout the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle. We demonstrate that as the parasite matures, it reduces the incorporation of anapleurotic carbon from glucose and increases incorporation via glutamine. This finding highlights the parasite's ability to restructure metabolism to meet its developmental requirements. P. falciparum NF54 and pdh e1α-G2/B9 clones were cultured and synchronized by standard methods (23Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. Synchronization of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocytic stages in culture.J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar, 24Trager W. Jensen J.B. Human malaria parasites in continuous culture.Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6161) Google Scholar) with the modification that culture flasks were maintained at 37 °C in an atmospherically controlled incubator set at 5% CO2, 6% O2. Parasitemia and synchronicity was monitored using microscopy and Giemsa-stained thin-blood smear slides. Uninfected erythrocytes (from the same donor) were cultured for 48-h in parallel before any experimentation. Mycoplasma testing was performed routinely to ensure contamination-free cultures. Cell counts were taken for all experiments with a Neubauer hemocytometer. Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes (originating from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research) were maintained at 27 °C and 75% humidity on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Larval stages were reared after standard protocols as described in the MR4 manual with larval stages maintained on finely ground Tetramin fish food and adult mosquitoes maintained on 8% dextrose in 0.05% para-aminobenzoic acid water. In vitro P. falciparum NF54 blood stage cultures were maintained in RPMI 1640 (25 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine) supplemented with 50 μm hypoxanthine and 10% A+ human serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 5% O2, and 90% N2. Cells were subcultured into O+ erythrocytes. Gametocyte cultures were initiated at 5% hematocrit and 0.8–1% parasitemia (mixed stages) and maintained for up to 17 days with daily media changes. Non blood-fed adult female mosquitoes (3–7 days post-emergence) were fed on gametocyte cultures. Gametocyte cultures were quickly spun down, and the pelleted infected erythrocytes were diluted to a 40% hematocrit with fresh A+ human serum and O+ erythrocytes. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed through Parafilm for up to 20 min. After blood feeding, mosquitoes were maintained for up to 19 days at 27 °C, 75% humidity and provided with 8% dextrose solution in PABA water. Infection prevalence was checked at days 7–10 by examining dissected midguts under light microscopy for the presence of oocysts with salivary gland dissections performed at days 14–19. Parasite cultures were enriched using a modified magnetic enrichment method. A custom-built magnetic-separation apparatus was designed using Google Sketch and produced by Pokono via high density plastic three-dimensional printing. 1.5 in3 magnets (pull force 220 lbs) were purchased, and metal inserts cut on-site. The apparatus allowed the simultaneous use of four CS VarioMacs columns (Miltenyi Biotech) and the design can be downloaded from 3dwarehouse. Enrichment was performed by resuspending 1 ml of packed cell culture (10% parasitemia) in 15 ml (∼8% hematocrit) and passed through a single CS column with constant addition of complete RPMI until the eluent was transparent. Infected erythrocytes were then eluted separate from the magnetic apparatus, yielding 85–98% parasitemia. Separate strains were enriched simultaneously to maintain consistency between cell lines and allowed to recover at 37 °C for 1 h before experimentation. For [13C]glucose labeling experiments, complete RPMI was made using glucose-free RPMI powder (Sigma), and an appropriate amount of [6-13C]glucose (all stable-isotope compounds were acquired from Cambridge Isotopes) was added to give a final concentration of 11 mm. For thiamine-free/oxythiamine experiments, RPMI was reconstituted using 50× RPMI amino acid solution (Sigma) and individual vitamins, salts, and oxythiamine purchased from Sigma and Fischer. Fully reconstituted RPMI was always made in parallel and used as a control condition to ensure there was no variation in parasite growth between batches. The IC50 of oxythiamine was determined, and a low dose long-term incubation strategy was required to allow conversion of oxythiamine to oxythiamine pyrophosphate. [5-13C]Glutamine was added to glutamine-free RPMI at a final concentration of 2 mm for [5-13C]glutamine labeling experiments. [6-13C,15N]leucine labeling experiments were performed in complete custom-made RPMI without leucine and supplemented with [6-13C,15N]leucine at the RPMI concentration. [2-13C]Acetate and [1-13C]pyruvate (label in the 2-C position) labeling experiments were performed using complete RPMI with an appropriate amount of each compound added to give a concentration of 2 and 10 mm, respectively. Media were pH-titrated and added as a 1:1 ratio to cell suspensions containing label-free RPMI, giving a final concentration of 1 mm (acetate) and 5 mm (pyruvate). 11 mm unlabeled glucose was present in all experiments. Four methods were employed to extract metabolites. Steady-state incubations were extracted using the methods described previously (25Olszewski K.L. Llinás M. Extraction of hydrophilic metabolites from Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes for metabolomic analysis.Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 923: 259-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, infected erythrocytes were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 14,000 × g for 30 s. The supernatant was rapidly aspirated, and the cell pellet was extracted with 1 ml of 90% ice-cold methanol (containing the internal standard [4-13C,15N]aspartate). Samples were dried under nitrogen flow and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Isolated parasites were extracted from 10% parasitemia cultures by saponin lysis (0.08%) in Eppendorf tubes. Samples were rapidly washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS, and the parasite pellet was extracted with 90% methanol. The rapid-labeling and extraction method was adapted from previously described radiolabeled flux techniques (26Cobbold S.A. Martin R.E. Kirk K. Methionine transport in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.Int. J. Parasitol. 2011; 41: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes were loaded with 300 μl of 30% trifluoroacetic acid with 700 μl of an oil mixture (5:4 dibutyl phthalate:dibutyl octanol, density 1.02) layered above. Time courses were initiated with the 1:1 addition of cell suspensions to pre-warmed isotope-labeled media (1–2% final hematocrit) and incubated at 37 °C. At the appropriate time points, 1 ml of cell suspension was layered on top of the oil mixture and immediately centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 s. The supernatant and oil layer was removed, and the acid layer was mixed with 700 μl of 90% ice-cold methanol (containing the internal standard [4-13C,15N]aspartate) and centrifuged. The metabolite extracts were transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and immediately dried under nitrogen flow. Extracts were resuspended in 100 μl of H2O pH neutralized with 5–10 μl of 1 m ammonia bicarbonate, transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube, dried under nitrogen flow, and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Validation of this method was achieved by comparison to the standard 90% methanol extraction method. Fatty acid extractions were performed as described previously (27Kamphorst J.J. Fan J. Lu W. White E. Rabinowitz J.D. Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry analysis of fatty acid metabolism.Anal. Chem. 2011; 83: 9114-9122Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with processing blanks extracted in parallel. [16-13C]Palmitate was used as an internal standard and used to normalize all signals. After data acquisition, processing blanks were subtracted from biological samples, providing the total ion counts associated with each condition. For all LC-MS analysis, samples were reconstituted in 100 μl of H2O and analyzed on an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer as previously described (28Xu Y.F. Létisse F. Absalan F. Lu W. Kuznetsova E.

The data presented in the glutamine panel of Fig. 5C were collected on a Finnigan TSQ Quantum Ultra triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source, operating in positive mode. Uninfected and enriched infected erythrocytes were incubated for 2 h in [6-13C]glucose RPMI and subsequently extracted with 90% methanol. Samples were dried down under N2 gas, then resuspended in 99.9% D2O and titrated to pH 7.40 (±0.01; uncorrected glass electrode reading). Two-dimensional 13C,1H heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR spectra were collected on a 500-MHz Bruker spectrometer equipped with a 1H-optimized triple resonance cryoprobe. Heteronuclear single quantum correlations were acquired in 4 transients, with 8192 directly acquired points and 1028 increments. Spectra were Fourier transform with shifted sine bell window function, zero-filled, and phased in TopSpin. Spectra were analyzed using rNMR (29Lewis I.A. Schommer S.C. Markley J.L. rNMR. Open source software for identifying and quantifying metabolites in NMR spectra.Magn. Reson. Chem. 2009; 47: S123-S126Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and metabolites were identified and quantified using established methods (30Lewis I.A. Schommer S.C. Hodis B. Robb K.A. Tonelli M. Westler W.M. Sussman M.R. Markley J.L. Method for determining molar concentrations of metabolites in complex solutions from two-dimensional 1H-13C NMR spectra.Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 9385-9390Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Thermo Fisher mass spectrometry RAW files were converted from profile mode into centroid mode using the ReAdW program (31Keller A. Eng J. Zhang N. Li X.J. Aebersold R. A uniform proteomics MS/MS analysis platform utilizing open XML file formats.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2005; 1 (0017)Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) and loaded into MAVEN, a publicly available analysis program (32Clasquin M.F. Melamud E. Rabinowitz J.D. LC-MS data processing with MAVEN. A metabolomic analysis and visualization engine.Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2012; (Chapter 14, Unit 14.11)PubMed Google Scholar). Correct assignment was confirmed via the addition of pure standard for all metabolites presented. Isotope-labeled forms were identified using the expected mass shifts given by 13C and 15N. Peaks below an ion count of 1000 were excluded from analysis. Raw signals were normalized to the internal control, corrected for natural abundance where appropriate, and adjusted to ion count/108 cells using cells counts taken for each sample. For quantification of glycolytic intermediates the signal ratio of the 13C-labeled metabolite (complete pool labeling was achieved with [13C]glucose and [13C]acetate for 2 h) to its unlabeled internal standard was used and to convert ion count/108 cells into intracellular concentration as previously described (33Bennett B.D.

Protoc. 2008; 3: 1299-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), assuming the intracellular volume of an infected erythrocyte is 75 fl (34Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For TCA cycle intermediates, pure 13C-labeled standards were added to unlabeled parasite extracts and quantified as described above. Graphical representations and statistical analysis were performed in GraphPad. A paired two-tail Student's t test was performed for pairwise statistical comparisons, and a one-way analysis of variance was performed for multiple statistical comparison. See supplemental Methods for further experimental details. To investigate central carbon metabolism of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes, we used stable-isotope labeling. Unfortunately, parasite biology is not amenable to existing rapid-labeling techniques utilized in bacterial metabolomics studies, which use filter paper-adhered cells to rapidly transfer samples between labeled media to extraction solution (35Amador-Noguez D. Brasg I.A. Feng X.J. Roquet N. Rabinowitz J.D. Metabolome remodeling during the acidogenic-solventogenic transition in Clostridium acetobutylicum.Appl. Environ.

Ultrasensitive regulation of anapleurosis via allosteric activation of PEP carboxylase.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, we developed a rapid stable-isotope labeling technique to measure dynamic glycolytic flux in Plasmodium (see “Experimental Procedures”). Magnet-enriched uninfected and infected erythrocytes (trophozoite stage) suspended in [12C]glucose RPMI were supplemented with [6-13C]glucose (final concentration 11 mm at an isotope ratio of 1:1 12C:13C). Turnover of intracellular glycolytic intermediates was monitored over a 1-h period via LC-MS (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). The total metabolite pool (presented as intracellular concentration; Fig. 1A, top panel) was unchanged across the time course, indicating that the conditions used did not perturb parasite metabolism. Isotopic labeling kinetics in glycolytic intermediates indicated differential labeling rates between the upper and lower halves of glycolysis; fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was completely labeled in less than 2 min, whereas phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, and lactate required an hour to reach isotopic equilibrium (Fig. 1A). Infected erythrocytes (NF54) showed a significant increase in the total pool of most metabolic intermediates and in the glycolytic flux relative to uninfected erythrocytes (supplemental Table S1; all p < 0.01). Surprisingly, unlike glycolytic intermediates, the acetyl-CoA pool did not completely label in the conditions tested, labeling only 42 ± 9% of the total pool after 1 h and 77 ± 3% after 3 h (Fig. 1B). The E1 subunit of the PDH complex mediates the thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent decarboxylation of pyruvate and is considered critical for normal PDH function. To ensure that P. falciparum produce the E1 subunit and all of the additional subunits of the PDH complex, we first used MS/MS proteomics to identify the subunits using the NF54 strain during the blood stage (supplemental Fig. S2 and Table S2). Knowing that the complex was expressed, we generated a pdh e1α- line by homologous recombination to investigate acetyl-CoA metabolism in the parasite (supplemental Fig. S3). Surprisingly, PDH-disrupted parasites had no signification alterations in glycolytic flux (Fig. 1A). Moreover, PDH disrupted parasites converted [6-13C]glucose into +2 atomic mass unit-shifted acetyl-CoA (consistent with the incorporation of two 13C atoms, referred to henceforth as M+2) and M+2 citrate (the first product of acetyl-CoA metaboli"
https://openalex.org/W2145888122,"The pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs) are transient embryonic blood vessels that make indispensable contributions to the carotid arteries and great vessels of the heart, including the aorta and pulmonary arteries. During embryogenesis, the PAAs appear in a craniocaudal sequence to connect pre-existing segments of the primitive circulation after de novo vasculogenic assembly from angioblast precursors. Despite the unique spatiotemporal characteristics of PAA development, the embryonic origins of PAA angioblasts and the genetic factors regulating their emergence remain unknown. Here, we identify the embryonic source of PAA endothelium as nkx2.5(+) progenitors in lateral plate mesoderm long considered to adopt cell fates within the heart exclusively. Further, we report that PAA endothelial differentiation relies on Nkx2.5, a canonical cardiac transcription factor not previously implicated in blood vessel formation. Together, these studies reveal the heart field origin of PAA endothelium and attribute a new vasculogenic function to the cardiac transcription factor Nkx2.5 during great vessel precursor development."
https://openalex.org/W2091869871,"Globally, about 1% of pregnant women are persistently infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Mother-to-child transmission of HCV occurs in 3-5% of pregnancies and accounts for most new childhood infections. HCV-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are vital in the clearance of acute HCV infections, but in the 60-80% of infections that persist, these cells become functionally exhausted or select for mutant viruses that escape T cell recognition. Increased HCV replication during pregnancy suggests that maternofetal immune tolerance mechanisms may further impair HCV-specific CTLs, limiting their selective pressure on persistent viruses. To assess this possibility, we characterized circulating viral quasispecies during and after consecutive pregnancies in two women. This revealed a loss of some escape mutations in HLA class I epitopes during pregnancy that was associated with emergence of more fit viruses. CTL selective pressure was reimposed after childbirth, at which point escape mutations in these epitopes again predominated in the quasispecies and viral load dropped sharply. Importantly, the viruses transmitted perinatally were those with enhanced fitness due to reversion of escape mutations. Our findings indicate that the immunoregulatory changes of pregnancy reduce CTL selective pressure on HCV class I epitopes, thereby facilitating vertical transmission of viruses with optimized replicative fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2068921410,"Sexual differences are only partially attributable to hormones. Cultured male or female cells, even from embryos before sexual differentiation, differ in gene expression and sensitivity to toxins, and these differences persist in isolated primary cells. Male and female cells from Swiss Webster CWF mice manifest sex-distinct patterns of DNA methylation for X-ist and for cytochrome P450 (CYP; family members 1a1, 2e1m, and 7b1. Dnmt3l is differentially expressed but not differentially methylated, and Gapdh is neither differentially methylated nor expressed. CYP family genes differ in expression in whole tissue homogenates and cell cultures, with female Cyp expression 2- to 355-fold higher and Dnmt3l 12- to 32-fold higher in males. DNA methylation in the promoters of these genes is sex dimorphic; reducing methylation differences reduces to 1- to 6-fold differences in the expression of these genes. Stress or estradiol alters both methylation and gene expression. We conclude that different methylation patterns partially explain the sex-based differences in expression of CYP family members and X-ist, which potentially leads to inborn differences between males and females and their different responses to chronic and acute changes. Sex-differential methylation may have medical effects.—Penaloza, C.G., Estevez, B., Han, D.M., Norouzi, M., Lockshin, R.A., Zakeri, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2070125209,"Accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to a myriad of kidney diseases. However, the regulatory role of miRNAs on the key molecules implicated in kidney fibrosis remains poorly understood. Bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) and its related BMP-6 have recently emerged as key regulators of kidney fibrosis. Using the established unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model of kidney fibrosis as our experimental model, we examined the regulatory role of miRNAs on BMP-7/6 signaling. By analyzing the potential miRNAs that target BMP-7/6 in silica, we identified miR-22 as a potent miRNA targeting BMP-7/6. We found that expression levels of BMP-7/6 were significantly elevated in the kidneys of the miR-22 null mouse. Importantly, mice with targeted deletion of miR-22 exhibited attenuated renal fibrosis in the UUO model. Consistent with these in vivo observations, primary renal fibroblast isolated from miR-22-deficient UUO mice demonstrated a significant increase in BMP-7/6 expression and their downstream targets. This phenotype could be rescued when cells were transfected with miR-22 mimics. Interestingly, we found that miR-22 and BMP-7/6 are in a regulatory feedback circuit, whereby not only miR-22 inhibits BMP-7/6, but miR-22 by itself is induced by BMP-7/6. Finally, we identified two BMP-responsive elements in the proximal region of miR-22 promoter. These findings identify miR-22 as a critical miRNA that contributes to renal fibrosis on the basis of its pivotal role on BMP signaling cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2091998416,"NEDD4-like ubiquitin ligase 2 (NEDL2) is a HECT type ubiquitin ligase. NEDL2 enhances p73 transcriptional activity and degrades ATR kinase in lamin misexpressed cells. Compared with the important functions of other HECT type ubiquitin ligase, there is less study concerning the function and regulation of NEDL2. Using primary antibody immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we identify a list of potential proteins that are putative NEDL2-interacting proteins. The candidate list contains many of mitotic proteins, especially including several subunits of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and Cdh1, an activator of APC/C. Cdh1 can interact with NEDL2 in vivo and in vitro. Cdh1 recognizes one of the NEDL2 destruction boxes (R(740)GSL(743)) and targets it for degradation in an APC/C-dependent manner during mitotic exit. Overexpression of Cdh1 reduces the protein level of NEDL2, whereas knockdown of Cdh1 increases the protein level of NEDL2 but has no effect on the NEDL2 mRNA level. NEDL2 associates with mitotic spindles, and its protein level reaches a maximum in mitosis. The function of NEDL2 during mitosis is essential because NEDL2 depletion prolongs metaphase, and overexpression of NEDL2 induces chromosomal lagging. Elevated expression of NEDL2 protein and mRNA are both found in colon cancer and cervix cancer. We conclude that NEDL2 is a novel substrate of APC/C-Cdh1 as cells exit mitosis and functions as a regulator of the metaphase to anaphase transition. Its overexpression may contribute to tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1975706895,"The authors find that GABAAR-mediated tonic currents recorded in rodent cerebellar granules cells can be modulated by ethanol in opposite directions in different strains exhibiting opposite preferences in alcohol consumption. These differences in ethanol sensitivity across strains are linked to differential levels of expression of presynaptic neuronal nitric oxide synthase and postsynaptic PKC activity. The molecular mechanisms that mediate genetic variability in response to alcohol are unclear. We found that alcohol had opposite actions (enhancement or suppression) on GABAA receptor (GABAAR) inhibition in granule cells from the cerebellum of behaviorally sensitive, low alcohol–consuming Sprague-Dawley rats and DBA/2 mice and behaviorally insensitive, high alcohol–consuming C57BL/6 mice, respectively. The effect of alcohol on granule cell GABAAR inhibition was determined by a balance between two opposing effects: enhanced presynaptic vesicular release of GABA via alcohol inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and a direct suppression of the activity of postsynaptic GABAARs. The balance of these two processes was determined by differential expression of neuronal NOS (nNOS) and postsynaptic PKC activity, both of which varied across the rodent genotypes. These findings identify opposing molecular processes that differentially control the magnitude and polarity of GABAAR responses to alcohol across rodent genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2067144031,"Explaining Anomalous Early Isotopes Meteorites contain some of the oldest materials formed in the solar system, including silicate minerals similar in composition to those on Earth. These meteorites, however, often differ in their oxygen isotopic composition, implying that their formation involved a different chemical mechanism than younger solar-system materials. Chakraborty et al. (p. 463 ) performed a series of experiments and found that mixing of SiO gas and OH leads to a mass-independent isotope fractionation in SiO 2 solid products similar to those observed in the oldest meteorites. This oxidation reaction may thus have served as the first source for silicates with anomalous oxygen isotopic compositions in the solar nebula."
https://openalex.org/W1993399909,"p16(INK4a) is a tumor suppressor protein involved in several stress-related cellular responses, including apoptosis. Recent lines of evidence indicate that p16(INK4a) is also a modulator of gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this novel function are still obscure. Here, we present clear evidence that p16(INK4a) modulates the levels of various microRNAs, with marked positive effect on miR-141 and miR-146b-5p. This effect is mediated through the formation of the p16-CDK4-Sp1 heterocomplex, which binds to Sp1 consensus-binding motifs present in the promoters of miR-141 and miR-146b-5p, and it enables their transcription. In addition, we have shown that p16(INK4a) interacts with Sp1 through the fourth ankyrin repeat, which is crucial for Sp1 binding to the miR-141 and miR-146b-5p promoters and their transcriptional activation. The physiological importance of this association was revealed by the inability of cancer-related p16(INK4a) mutants to interact with Sp1. Moreover, we have shown p16-CDK4-Sp1-dependent up-regulation of miR-141 and miR-146b-5p following UV light-induced DNA damage and the role of these two microRNAs in mediating p16-related induction of apoptosis in response to this genotoxic stress. Together, these results indicate that p16(INK4a) associates with CDK4 not only to inhibit the cell cycle but also to enable the transcription of two important onco-microRNAs, which act as downstream effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2032548196,"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a second messenger for mobilizing Ca(2+) from intracellular stores in various cell types. Extracellular application of NAADP has been shown to elicit intracellular Ca(2+) signals, indicating that it is readily transported into cells. However, little is known about the functional role of this NAADP uptake system. Here, we show that NAADP is effectively transported into selected cell types involved in glucose homeostasis, such as adipocytes and pancreatic β-cells, but not the acinar cells, in a high glucose-dependent manner. NAADP uptake was inhibitable by Ned-19, a NAADP mimic; dipyridamole, a nucleoside inhibitor; or NaN3, a metabolic inhibitor or under Ca(2+)-free conditions. Furthermore, NAADP was found to be released from pancreatic islets upon stimulation by high glucose. Consistently, administration of NAADP to type 2 diabetic mice improved glucose tolerance. We propose that NAADP is functioning as an autocrine/paracrine hormone important in glucose homeostasis. NAADP is thus a potential antidiabetic agent with therapeutic relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2005300267,"The stem cell protein SALL4 plays a critical role in hematopoiesis by regulating the cell fate. In primitive hematopoietic precursors, it activates or represses important genes via recruitment of various epigenetic factors such as DNA methyltransferases, and histone deacylases. Here, we demonstrate that LSD1, a histone lysine demethylase, also participates in the trans-repressive effects of SALL4. Based on luciferase assays, the amine oxidase domain of LSD1 is important in suppressing SALL4-mediated reporter transcription. In freshly isolated adult mouse bone marrows, both SALL4 and LSD1 proteins are preferentially expressed in undifferentiated progenitor cells and co-localize in the nuclei. Further sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that these two factors share the same binding sites at the promoter regions of important hematopoietic regulatory genes including EBF1, GATA1, and TNF. In addition, studies from both gain- and loss-of-function models revealed that SALL4 dynamically controls the binding levels of LSD1, which is accompanied by a reversely changed histone 3 dimethylated lysine 4 at the same promoter regions. Finally, shRNA-mediated knockdown of LSD1 in hematopoietic precursor cells resulted in altered SALL4 downstream gene expression and increased cellular activity. Thus, our data revealed that histone demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate SALL4-mediated transcription, and the dynamic regulation of SALL4-associated epigenetic factors cooperatively modulates early hematopoietic precursor proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2019380605,"The tandem pore domain halothane-inhibited K(+) channel 1 (THIK1) produces background K(+) currents. Despite 62% amino acid identity with THIK1, THIK2 is not active upon heterologous expression. Here, we show that this apparent lack of activity is due to a unique combination of retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and low intrinsic channel activity at the plasma membrane. A THIK2 mutant containing a proline residue (THIK2-A155P) in its second inner helix (M2) produces K(+)-selective currents with properties similar to THIK1, including inhibition by halothane and insensitivity to extracellular pH variations. Another mutation in the M2 helix (I158D) further increases channel activity and affects current kinetics. We also show that the cytoplasmic amino-terminal region of THIK2 (Nt-THIK2) contains an arginine-rich motif (RRSRRR) that acts as a retention/retrieval signal. Mutation of this motif in THIK2 induces a relocation of the channel to the plasma membrane, resulting in measurable currents, even in the absence of mutations in the M2 helix. Cell surface delivery of a Nt-THIK2-CD161 chimera is increased by mutating the arginines of the retention motif but also by converting the serine embedded in this motif to aspartate, suggesting a phosphorylation-dependent regulation of THIK2 trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2034256284,"It has been proposed recently that ATP hydrolysis in ATPase enzymes proceeds via an initial intermediate in which the dissociated γ-phosphate of ATP is bound in the protein as a metaphosphate (PγO3−). A combined quantum/classical analysis of this dissociated nucleotide state inside myosin provides a quantitative understanding of how the enzyme stabilizes this unusual metaphosphate. Indeed, in vacuum, the energy of the ADP3−·PγO3−·Mg2+ complex is much higher than that of the undissociated ATP4−. The protein brings it to a surprisingly low value. Energy decomposition reveals how much each interaction in the protein stabilizes the metaphosphate state; backbone peptides of the P-loop contribute 50% of the stabilization energy, and the side chain of Lys-185+ contributes 25%. This can be explained by the fact that these groups make strong favorable interactions with the α- and β-phosphates, thus favoring the charge distribution of the metaphosphate state over that of the ATP state. Further stabilization (16%) is achieved by a hydrogen bond between the backbone C=O of Ser-237 (on loop Switch-1) and a water molecule perfectly positioned to attack the PγO3− in the subsequent hydrolysis step. The planar and singly negative PγO3− is a much better target for the subsequent nucleophilic attack by a negatively charged OH− than the tetrahedral and doubly negative PγO42− group of ATP. Therefore, we argue that the present mechanism of metaphosphate stabilization is common to the large family of nucleotide-hydrolyzing enzymes. Methodologically, this work presents a computational approach that allows us to obtain a truly quantitative conception of enzymatic strategy.

https://openalex.org/W2007919520,"The self-replicative conformation of misfolded prion proteins (PrP) is considered a major determinant for the seeding activity, infectiousness, and strain characteristics of prions in different host species. Prion-associated seeding activity, which converts cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) into Proteinase K-resistant, infectious PrP particles (PrP(TSE)), can be monitored in vitro by protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA). Thus, PMCA has been established as a valuable analytical tool in prion research. Currently, however, it is under discussion whether prion strain characteristics are preserved during PMCA when parent seeds are amplified in PrP(C) substrate from the identical host species. Here, we report on the comparative structural analysis of parent and progeny (PMCA-derived) PrP seeds by an improved approach of sensitive infrared microspectroscopy. Infrared microspectroscopy revealed that PMCA of native hamster 263K scrapie seeds in hamster PrP(C) substrate caused conformational alterations in progeny seeds that were accompanied by an altered resistance to Proteinase K, higher sedimentation velocities in gradient ultracentrifugations, and a longer incubation time in animal bioassays. When these progeny seeds were propagated in hamsters, misfolded PrP from brain extracts of these animals showed mixed spectroscopic and biochemical properties from both parental and progeny seeds. Thus, strain modifications of 263K prions induced by PMCA seem to have been partially reversed when PMCA products were reinoculated into the original host species."
https://openalex.org/W2039132241,"Genome-scale mapping suggests that the function of DNA methylation varies with genomic context beyond transcriptional repression. However, the use of DNA-demethylating agents (e.g. 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5aza-dC)) to study epigenetic regulation often focuses on gene activation and ignores repression elicited by 5aza-dC. Here, we show that repression of NEK2, which encodes the never in mitosis A (NIMA)-related kinase, by 5aza-dC is context-specific as NEK2 transcript levels were reduced in HCT116 colon cancer cells but not in isogenic p53(-/-) cells. Bisulfite sequencing showed that DNA methylation was restricted to the distal region of the NEK2 promoter. Demethylation by 5aza-dC was associated with increased accessibility to micrococcal nuclease, i.e. nucleosome depletion. Conversely, methyltransferase accessibility protocol for individual templates (MAPit) methylation footprinting showed that nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation at the distal promoter were significantly increased in p53(-/-) cells, suggesting dynamic regulation of chromatin structure at this region by p53 in HCT116 cells. Stabilization of endogenous p53 by doxorubicin or ectopic expression of p53, but not a p53 DNA-binding mutant, decreased NEK2 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated direct and specific association of p53 with the distal NEK2 promoter, which was enhanced by doxorubicin. Luciferase reporters confirmed that this region is required for p53-mediated repression of NEK2 promoter activity. Lastly, modulation of p53 abundance altered nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation at its binding region. These results identify NEK2 as a novel p53-repressed gene, illustrate that its repression by 5aza-dC is specific and associated with nucleosome reorganization, and provide evidence that identification of partially methylated regions can reveal novel p53 target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2113524772,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae ergosterol biosynthesis, like cholesterol biosynthesis in mammals, is regulated at the transcriptional level by a sterol feedback mechanism. Yeast studies defined a 7-bp consensus sterol-response element (SRE) common to genes involved in sterol biosynthesis and two transcription factors, Upc2 and Ecm22, which direct transcription of sterol biosynthetic genes. The 7-bp consensus SRE is identical to the anaerobic response element, AR1c. Data indicate that Upc2 and Ecm22 function through binding to this SRE site. We now show that it is two novel anaerobic AR1b elements in the UPC2 promoter that direct global ERG gene expression in response to a block in de novo ergosterol biosynthesis, brought about by antifungal drug treatment. The AR1b elements are absolutely required for auto-induction of UPC2 gene expression and protein and require Upc2 and Ecm22 for function. We further demonstrate the direct binding of recombinant expressed S. cerevisiae ScUpc2 and pathogenic Candida albicans CaUpc2 and Candida glabrata CgUpc2 to AR1b and SRE/AR1c elements. Recombinant endogenous promoter studies show that the UPC2 anaerobic AR1b elements act in trans to regulate ergosterol gene expression. Our results indicate that Upc2 must occupy UPC2 AR1b elements in order for ERG gene expression induction to take place. Thus, the two UPC2-AR1b elements drive expression of all ERG genes necessary for maintaining normal antifungal susceptibility, as wild type cells lacking these elements have increased susceptibility to azole antifungal drugs. Therefore, targeting these specific sites for antifungal therapy represents a novel approach to treat systemic fungal infections."
