https://openalex.org/W2061236267,"Transcription of the c-fos gene is transiently activated to generate large amounts of unstable c-fos RNA when quiescent fibroblasts are stimulated by polypeptide mitogens or whole serum. A cloned human c-fos gene (c-fosH) transfected into mouse fibroblasts is regulated in a similar manner. An element essential for transcription activation is located between nucleotides -332 and -276 relative to the mRNA cap site. This element has properties similar to those of previously characterized transcription enhancer elements. However, replacement of the 5' activating element by enhancers from SV40 or Moloney murine leukemia virus does not allow regulated c-fosH expression. The study of fusion genes showed that in addition to the 5' activating element, transient accumulation of c-fosH RNA following serum stimulation requires sequences at the 3' end of the c-fosH gene."
https://openalex.org/W1972984824,"Heterokaryons provide a model system in which to examine how tissue-specific phenotypes arise and are maintained. When muscle cells are fused with nonmuscle cells, muscle gene expression is activated in the nonmuscle cell type. Gene expression was studied either at a single cell level with monoclonal antibodies or in mass cultures at a biochemical and molecular level. In all of the nonmuscle cell types tested, including representatives of different embryonic lineages, phenotypes, and developmental stages, muscle gene expression was induced. Differences among cell types in the kinetics, frequency, and gene dosage requirements for gene expression provide clues to the underlying regulatory mechanisms. These results show that the expression of genes in the nuclei of differentiated cells is remarkably plastic and susceptible to modulation by the cytoplasm. The isolation of the genes encoding the tissue-specific trans-acting regulators responsible for muscle gene activation should now be possible."

https://openalex.org/W2028612120,"A central question in developmental biology is to explain how cells in different regions of an embryo acquire different developmental fates. We have begun to address this question by investigating whether specific RNAs are localized within a frog egg. Differential screening of a cDNA library shows that most maternal RNAs are uniformly distributed along the animal-vegetal axis. However, we find that a rare class of maternal RNAs is localized. cDNA clones of four localized RNAs have been characterized. Three of these cDNAs are derived from maternal RNAs that are concentrated in the animal hemisphere of unfertilized eggs and remain localized through the early blastula stage. One cDNA is derived from a maternal RNA found almost exclusively in the vegetal hemisphere at both stages. These studies show that some informational molecules, specifically RNAs, are localized in eggs and are inherited by particular blastomeres."

https://openalex.org/W2060295481,"The 3200 and 1600 nucleotide mRNAs encoding rat brain proteolipid protein (PLP), the major protein component of central nervous system myelin, are heterogeneous at their 5' ends, differ in their 3' polyadenylation sites, and are transcribed from a single gene. The mRNAs, which first appear postnatally, encode identical 277 amino acid proteins that are 99% identical to the bovine protein sequence. Thus, PLP has been highly conserved during mammalian evolution. A single amino-terminal methionine is removed post-translationally, indicating that PLP does not require a signal peptide sequence for insertion into the myelin membrane. Mouse and monkey utilize the 3200 but not the 1600 nucleotide mRNA, suggesting that there is no functional necessity for two sizes of rat PLP mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2059790898,"A crucial event in the hearing process is the transduction of mechanical stimuli into electrical signals by hair cells, the sensory receptors of the internal ear. Stimulation results in the rapid opening of ionic channels in the mechanically sensitive organelles of these cells, their hair bundles. These transduction channels, which are nonselectively permeable, are directly excited by hair-bundle displacement. Hair cells are selectively responsive to particular frequencies of stimulation, both due to the mechanical properties of their hair bundles and because of an ensemble of ionic channels that constitute an electrical resonator."
https://openalex.org/W1484193174,"With the use of -cAMP/+cAMP activity ratios of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase) in fat cell extracts as an index of cellular cAMP concentrations, it is apparent from both the current literature and from data presented in this paper that classical cell isolation procedures yield cells whose behavior is unpredictable from day to day. Herein, procedures are described for isolating adipocytes, preparing cytosolic extracts, and assaying A-kinase that result in kinase activity ratios in isolated cells equal to those in the fat pad from which cells are derived, approximately 0.05. An important modification in the procedure is the inclusion of 200 nM exogenous Ado in all cell manipulation media, and the data indicate that variable removal of contaminating endogenous Ado accounts for unpredictable results with standard cell isolation techniques. A further benefit of Ado inclusion is greatly reduced cell lysis. Acute removal of Ado with adenosine deaminase results in rapid elevation of A-kinase activity ratios and lipolysis which, in fasted animals, equals that achieved with lipolytic hormones. Cells from fed animals exhibit poor predictability in behavior. Moreover, A-kinase activity ratios exhibit seasonal tendencies in response to Ado removal, with cells isolated in spring being more activated than cells isolated later in the year. The information and procedures in this paper form the basis for succeeding papers on the regulation of adipocyte metabolism by hormones."

https://openalex.org/W2030064747,"The gene encoding the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax has been cloned. The deduced sequence of the protein consists of 373 amino acids with a central region of 19 tandem repeats of the nonapeptide Asp-Arg-Ala-Asp/Ala-Gly-Gln-Pro-Ala-Gly. A synthetic 18-amino acid peptide containing two tandem repeats binds to a monoclonal antibody directed to the CS protein of Plasmodium vivax and inhibits the interaction of this antibody with the native protein in sporozoite extracts. The portions of the CS gene that do not contain repeats are closely related to the corresponding regions of the CS genes of two simian malarias, Plasmodium cynomolgi and Plasmodium knowlesi. In contrast, the homology between the CS genes of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum, another malaria parasite of humans, is very limited."
https://openalex.org/W2015754274,"Glial cells, which outnumber neurones in the central nervous system, have traditionally been considered to be electrically inexcitable and to play only a passive role in the electrical activity of the brain1. Recent reports have demonstrated, however, that certain glial cells, when maintained in primary culture, possess voltage-dependent ion channels2–4. It remains to be demonstrated whether these channels are also present in glial cells in vivo. I show here that Müller cells, the principal glial cells of the vertebrate retina, can generate ‘Ca2+spikes’ in freshly excised slices of retinal tissue. In addition, voltage-clamp studies of enzymatically dissociated Müller cells demonstrate the presence of four types of voltage-dependent ion channels: a Ca2+ channel, a Ca2+-activated K+ channel, a fast-inactivating (type A) K+ channel and an inward-rectifying K+ channel. Currents generated by these voltage-dependent channels may enhance the ability of Müller cells to regulate extracellular K+ levels in the retina and may be involved in the generation of the electroretinogram."

Psoriatic fibroblasts can induce hyperproliferative activity in normal keratinocytes. The psoriatic epidermis from lesions continues to proliferate at high rates for at least 15 days in this model, and normal fibroblasts are unable to suppress this hyperproliferation. The primary defect in psoriatic skin may reside in the dermal fibroblast."
https://openalex.org/W2092715930,"This study presents evidence that inositol trisphosphate (IP3) releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores in sea urchin eggs. First, high voltage discharge was used to transiently permeabilize eggs and introduce IP3; the resultant induction of cortical reactions (a well characterized Ca2+-dependent event) provided indirect evidence that IP3 released Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Next, Ca2+ uptake and release from egg homogenates and homogenate fractions were monitored by both Ca2+ minielectrodes and the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, quin-2. Both assay methods showed Ca2+ release upon IP3 addition, with a half-maximal response at 50-60 nM IP3 and maximal Ca2+ release at approximately 1 microM IP3. Homogenates were 300-fold more sensitive to IP3 than IP2, and Ca2+ release was 95% inhibited by the Ca2+ antagonist TMB-8 (3 mM). Fractionation by density gradient centrifugation showed that activities for Ca2+ sequestration and IP3 responsiveness co-purified with endoplasmic reticulum microsomes. Following an initial IP3 addition, homogenates were refractory (desensitized) to additional IP3. However, if homogenates were centrifuged and the vesicles resuspended in media lacking IP3, they would respond to added IP3, therefore, showing that desensitization is most likely due to the presence of IP3. This study also shows that the mechanism of IP3 action is inherent to the microsomes and ions present in the medium used, with no cytoplasmic factors being required. The stability of this microsome preparation and the purification obtained with density gradient centrifugation make this a promising system with which to further characterize the mechanism of IP3 action."
https://openalex.org/W1577316626,"It has previously been reported that a mouse (C57BL/6) monoclonal antibody, M2590, was established against syngeneic melanoma B16 cells, which was shown to react only with melanoma cells from various species but not with other tumor cells or normal tissues (Taniguchi, M., and Wakabayashi, S. (1984) Gann 75, 418-426). In the present study, the specificity of M2590 antibody was shown to be directed to a saccharide arrangement (NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4Glc (or -GlcNAc)) of gangliosides by three different assay systems including enzyme immunostaining on thin layer plates, sandwich radioimmunoassay, and enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assays using a variety of glycolipids with known structures. Neither gangliosides having NeuGc terminus, including NeuGc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4Glc-ceramide and NeuGc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc-ceramide, nor ganglio series gangliosides carrying NeuAc reacted with the antibody. An M2590 antibody-reactive antigen was isolated from B16 melanoma cells, and its structure was determined to be NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4Glc-ceramide by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, methylation analysis, and exoglycosidase treatment. The ceramide was composed of d18:1 as its long-chain base and C16:0, C24:1, and C24:0 as major fatty acids. The same ganglioside was also detected in the culture supernatant of the melanoma cells as shedding antigen."
https://openalex.org/W1497030919,"The very late antigen complexes VLA-1 and VLA-2 which appear on long-term activated human T cells have been characterized with respect to 1) subunit arrangement, 2) location of monoclonal antibody (MAb) binding sites, 3) carbohydrate content, and 4) protein homology. Cross-linking experiments showed that the VLA-1 complex is a heterodimer composed of an Mr 210,000 subunit (alpha 1) in acid-labile association with an Mr 130,000 subunit (beta). The VLA-2 complex is a heterodimer with an Mr 165,000 subunit (alpha 2) in base-labile association with the Mr 130,000 beta subunit. The subunits of VLA-1 (alpha 1 beta) and VLA-2 (alpha 2 beta) each appear to be arranged with 1:1 stoichiometry. The MAb A-1A5 has been shown to bind to an epitope on the common beta subunit, consistent with its recognition of both the VLA-1 and VLA-2 heterodimers. On the other hand, MAb TS2/7 bound to an epitope of the alpha 1 subunit, thus explaining the specific recognition of the VLA-1 heterodimer by TS2/7. Digestion of the alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta subunits with neuraminidase and with endoglycosidase F revealed that each subunit contains substantial sialic acid and N-linked carbohydrate. By one-dimensional peptide mapping, the alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta subunits were shown to be highly nonhomologous with respect to each other, although each subunit from different T cell sources appeared highly homologous if not identical."
https://openalex.org/W1604444075,"In the present study, we examine the effects of vitamin A on keratin protein and mRNA levels in human keratinocytes. In epidermal keratinocytes, the levels of keratins 5, 6, 14, and 17 decrease and keratins 13 and 19 increase in response to increasing concentrations of a potent synthetic trans-retinoic acid analog, arotinoid Ro 13-6298. In tracheal keratinocytes, a similar suppression is observed for keratins 5, 6, 14, 17, and 18 and an increase in keratin 19. Both induction and suppression responses show identical kinetics and both processes are half-maximal at 5 nM arotinoid and maximal at 10 nM. Utilizing cDNAs specific for keratins 5, 6, 13, and 19, we demonstrate that the mRNA levels for these keratins change coordinately with the corresponding amount of keratin protein, indicating that the control of keratin protein expression most likely resides at the level of mRNA synthesis and/or degradation. The identical kinetics for all of the responses, both inductive and suppressive, suggests that a common mechanism controls the expression of these genes. These results indicate that vitamin A produces more sweeping changes in keratinocyte function than previously appreciated in that many and perhaps all keratins are modulated by vitamin A. Moreover, these responses are 10- to 100-fold less sensitive to retinoid than the process of envelope formation, suggesting that at least two sets of processes with different sensitivities to vitamin A are present in keratinocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1595102998,"Calcineurin, a calmodulin-activated protein phosphatase, is known to dephosphorylate certain low molecular weight phosphate esters. The low molecular weight phosphatase activity of calcineurin has been studied by utilizing tyrosine phosphate derivatives. Kinetic studies suggest that the substrate specificity is dependent upon the electronic nature of the substrate in contrast to results obtained with alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli. Comparison of calcineurin and acid-catalyzed hydrolyses indicates a 1:1 correlation between the rate constants for the two processes. This correlation and other model studies have been utilized to provide insight into the chemical mechanism of calcineurin. Possible chemical mechanisms for calcineurin are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1529539654,"Regulation of the expression of the hepatic L-type pyruvate kinase gene by insulin and dietary fructose was studied in diabetic rats. Insulin increased the levels of putative nuclear RNA precursor species of this enzyme in parallel with that of total cellular pyruvate kinase L mRNA. These changes occurred more slowly than those induced by dietary fructose. Insulin caused a 3-fold increase in transcription of the pyruvate kinase L gene after 6 h and a 6-fold increase after 16 h. The increase caused by insulin was inhibited by glucagon, but not by adrenalectomy. Cycloheximide inhibited the induction caused by insulin, suggesting that insulin may stimulate transcription of the pyruvate kinase L gene by stimulating synthesis of some unknown protein. On the other hand, feeding fructose had no effect on transcription of the pyruvate kinase L gene. We previously showed that increases in the levels of putative nuclear RNA precursor species of the pyruvate kinase L after fructose feeding preceded changes in the levels of cytosolic pyruvate kinase L mRNA (Inoue, H., Noguchi, T., and Tanaka, T. (1984) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 96, 1457-1462). Thus, dietary fructose may increase the levels of pyruvate kinase L mRNA by stabilizing nuclear RNA species. Glucagon inhibited the increase in pyruvate kinase L mRNA caused by dietary fructose. However, plasma levels of glucagon and thyroid hormones were not decreased in diabetic rats after fructose feeding. In addition, treatment with triiodo-L-thyronine caused no change in the pyruvate kinase L mRNA level. Furthermore, adrenalectomy did not impair enzyme induction by fructose in diabetic rats. Thus, the effect of fructose on pyruvate kinase L seems to be directly on the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1580135653,"Low concentrations of digitonin disrupt the sarcolemma of adult rat heart myocytes selectively and completely. When the digitonin lysis is carried out in the presence of 10 mM Mg-ATP, the permeabilized cells retain the rod-cell morphology typical of heart cells in situ and show spontaneous phasic contractions. The rate of contraction is a function of the free Ca2+ concentration from a pCa of 7.2 to 5.2. Higher levels of free Ca2+ result in hypercontracture of the myocytes into round cells with characteristically distorted morphology. The sarcoplasmic reticulum of digitonin-lysed myocytes takes up Ca2+ in an ATP-dependent reaction that is inhibited and reversed by caffeine and strongly enhanced by procaine or ruthenium red. The Ca2+ accumulation has a Km of 0.6 microM Ca2+, depends on Pi (Km of 13 mM), and is strongly inhibited by bicarbonate ion. The hypercontracture of digitonin-lysed myocytes is a function of both the pCa and the Mg-ATP concentration of the suspending medium. Hypercontracture requires ATP. Hypercontracture due to Ca2+ overload occurs at lower Ca2+ concentrations when Mg-ATP is decreased from 10 to 1 mM. However, at low concentrations of Mg-ATP (in the range from 1 to 10 microM), hypercontracture also occurs and is essentially Ca2+-independent. Since hypercontracture of heart myocytes appears analogous to the formation of contraction bands in situ, these observations may be relevant to the phenomena of oxygen paradox and of Ca2+ paradox in intact myocardial tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1525596126,"The effects of short term stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors and elevations in intracellular cyclic AMP on nitrendipine-sensitive voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels of skeletal muscle cells in vitro has been studied using both the 45Ca2+ flux technique and [3H] nitrendipine-binding experiments. Isoproterenol increased the nitrendipine-sensitive 45Ca2+ influx under depolarizing conditions. The effects of isoproterenol were additive to those of depolarization and were antagonized by alprenolol. Half-maximal inhibition of 45Ca2+ influx induced both by depolarization and by isoproterenol occurred at a nitrendipine concentration of 1 nM. Treatments that resulted in an increased level of intracellular cyclic AMP, such as treatment with 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, theophylline, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, or 8-bromocyclic AMP also resulted in an increased rate of 45Ca2+ entry via nitrendipine-sensitive Ca2+ channel. In contrast, long term treatment of myotubes in culture with isoproterenol and other compounds that increased intracellular cyclic AMP led to a large increase in the number of nitrendipine receptors. This increase was accompanied by a 4-10-fold decrease in the affinity of the receptors for nitrendipine. Alprenolol inhibited the long term effects of isoproterenol. In vivo treatment of 7-day-old chicks with reserpine and alprenolol produced a decrease in the number of skeletal muscle nitrendipine receptors. This decrease in receptor number was accompanied by an increase in the affinity of nitrendipine for its receptor by a factor of 4 to 5. These effects on the nitrendipine receptor were prevented by simultaneous injection of isoproterenol. The results are discussed in relation to the role of beta-adrenergic receptors and intracellular cyclic AMP in the regulation of skeletal muscle Ca2+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1643779836,"The effects of muscarinic cholinergic stimulation on beta-adrenergic induced increases in phospholamban phosphorylation and Ca2+ transport were studied in intact myocardium. Isolated guinea pig ventricles were perfused via the coronary arteries with 32Pi, after which membrane vesicles were isolated from individual hearts. Isoproterenol produced reversible increases in 32P incorporation into phospholamban. Associated with the increases in 32P incorporation were increases in the initial rate of phosphate-facilitated Ca2+ uptake measured in aliquots of the same membrane vesicles isolated from the perfused hearts. The increases in 32P incorporation and calcium transport were significantly attenuated by the simultaneous administration of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine also attenuated increases in phospholamban phosphorylation and Ca2+ uptake produced by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine and forskolin. The contractile effects of all agents which increased cAMP levels (increased contractility and a reduction in the t1/2 of relaxation) were also attenuated by acetylcholine. The inhibitory effects of acetylcholine were associated with attenuation of the increases in cAMP levels produced by isoproterenol and isobutylmethylxanthine but not by forskolin. Acetylcholine also increased the rate of reversal of the functional and biochemical effects of isoproterenol by propranolol without affecting cAMP levels. These results suggest that cholinergic agonists inhibit the functional effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation in part by inhibition of phospholamban phosphorylation. This inhibition may be mediated by two potential mechanisms: inhibition of beta-adrenergic activation of adenylate cyclase and stimulation of dephosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1566871748,"The cytochrome d complex from Escherichia coli has been reconstituted in proteoliposomes. Previous studies have shown that the enzyme rapidly oxidizes ubiquinol-8 within the bilayer as well as the soluble homologue, ubiquinol-1, and that quinol oxidase activity is accompanied by the formation of a transmembrane potential across the vesicle bilayer. In this work, the proton pumping activity of the cytochrome in the reconstituted vesicles is examined. Ubiquinol-1 oxidase activity is shown to be accompanied by the net alkalinization of the interior space of the reconstituted vesicles and by the release of protons in the external volume. H+/O ratios varying from 0.6 to 1.2 were measured in different preparations, by the oxygen pulse technique. Antibodies which bind specifically to subunit I (cytochrome b558) of the 2-subunit oxidase were used to estimate the topology of the reconstituted oxidase in the vesicles. It was concluded that 70-85% of the molecules were oriented with subunit I facing the outside and that this population of molecules is responsible for the observed proton release. Correction for the fraction of the oxidase which pumps protons into the vesicle interior yields an estimate of H+/O = 1.7 +/- 0.2. It is proposed that the enzyme does not function as an actual proton pump, but that the enzyme oxidizes ubiquinol and reduces oxygen (to water) on opposite faces of the membrane. Hence, scalar chemistry would yield H+/O = 2 and an electrogenic reaction by virtue of the transmembrane electron transfer between the proposed active sites."
https://openalex.org/W1522687711,"Poly(A+) RNA isolated from livers of rats induced for stearyl-CoA desaturase contains elevated levels of mRNA for this enzyme which is translated in a rabbit reticulocyte system. The protein is immunologically and by peptide fingerprinting following Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion identical to the isolated enzyme and, therefore, not synthesized in a detectable larger precursor form. The desaturase mRNA is selectively translated on free cytoplasmic polysomes from rat liver and represents at least a 40-fold increase in translatable mRNA in livers of induced animals. Northern blot analysis, using a cDNA probe complementary to rat liver desaturase mRNA, demonstrated that the desaturase is encoded by a 4900-base mRNA which is elevated approximately 50-fold in induced liver."
https://openalex.org/W1570678736,"Cloned human apo-C-II cDNA was used as a hybridization probe to identify the human apo-C-II gene in a genomic library constructed in our laboratory. The isolated apo-C-II DNA was studied both by electron microscopy and by direct sequence analysis. Ultrastructural morphological analysis of RNA-DNA hybrids revealed that the apo-C-II gene had complex structures because of regions of inverted complementary sequences in and around the gene forming stem-and-loop structures which interfere with the formation of stable RNA:DNA hybrids. Extensive morphological analysis revealed a minimum of 3 intervening sequences (IVS), and their lengths were measured. Direct sequence analysis of the cloned gene confirmed the presence of 3 IVS. There are 4 Alu type sequences in IVS-I. We sequenced 4340 nucleotides which include 545 nucleotides in the 5' flanking region, the entire gene which spans 3320 nucleotides, and 475 nucleotides in the 3' flanking region which also encompasses an additional Alu sequence. The 5' end of the gene was identified by primer extension and sequencing of the primer extended cDNA. Apo-C-II mRNA structure was deduced from the cDNA sequence, the primer extension experiments, and the genomic sequence. It is 494 nucleotides in length. Its sequence differs from previously published sequences in that there are 7 additional nucleotides before the polyadenylate tail. In the 5' flanking region, nucleotides -234 to -213 encompass a GC-rich region which exhibits high homology (greater than 70%) to the 5' flanking regions of the genes of all the apolipoproteins published to date, namely, apo-A-II (-497 to -471), apo-A-I (approximately -196 to -179), apo-E (-409 to -391), and apo-C-III (approximately -116 to -103). This highly conserved region might represent some evolutionarily conserved sequences from these related genes and/or might represent a region with regulatory function."
https://openalex.org/W1479687765,"Reassociation of a 260-base pair cloned fragment of Lytechinus variegatus DNA with core histones has been shown to give rise to a uniquely positioned nucleosome (Simpson, R. T., and Stafford, D. W. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 51-55). In an attempt to define the features that dictate the unique positioning of the nucleosome, we have constructed a number of mutants of this DNA sequence. The ability of these mutants to form positioned nucleosomes was analyzed by DNase I digestion of the DNA after reassociation with chicken erythrocyte core histones. While all the mutants were efficiently incorporated into core particles, not all of these modified sequences were capable of forming a positioned nucleosome. Of the 13 mutants examined, 7 fell into a class that gave rise to nucleosomes in which no unique positioning could be demonstrated. While no specific feature of the DNA sequences has been identified as the critical factor in allowing, or dictating, the formation of positioned nucleosomes, our results do indicate that the region 20-30 bases either side of the center of the core particle appears to contain the major elements necessary for positioning. Additionally, these studies clearly show that differences in the digestion of naked and core particle DNA are related to specific interactions of the DNA and histones rather than to an altered specificity of the enzyme induced by the presence of the proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1505568511,"45Ca2+ release from a heavy fraction of rabbit skeletal muscle microsomes was induced by chemical depolarization (replacement of 0.15 M K gluconate with 0.15 M choline Cl), or addition of Ca2+ plus caffeine, or both. The time courses of Ca2+ release were investigated with a multimixing chemical quench apparatus by quenching the Ca2+ release reaction using 10 mM EGTA and 5 microM ruthenium red. At low ATP (e.g. 0.2 mM) and low extravesicular [Ca2+] (e.g. 0.1 microM), the time course of depolarization-induced Ca2+ release was similar to that determined by a spectrophotometric method (Ikemoto, N., Antoniu, B., and Kim, D.H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13151-13158). An increase of the extravesicular [Ca2+] up to 5 microM, or addition of high concentrations of ATP (e.g. 7.5 mM), shortened the lag phase that precedes depolarization-induced Ca2+ release and increased the amount of Ca2+ released. On the other hand, upon addition of several millimolars ATP the rate of (Ca2+ plus caffeine)-induced Ca2+ release was increased, resulting in the same time course as that of depolarization-induced Ca2+ release. Induction of Ca2+ release by combined application of chemical depolarization and Ca2+ plus caffeine resulted in the same time course as that induced by either method alone, suggesting that both types of Ca2+ release are mediated by a common channel rather than separate channels."
https://openalex.org/W1491590377,"Substantial amounts of ATP.Mg-dependent phosphorylase phosphatase (Fc. M) and its activator (kinase FA) were identified and extensively purified from pig brain, in spite of the fact that glycogen metabolism in the brain is of little importance. The brain Fc.M was completely inactive and could only be activated by ATP.Mg and FA, isolated either from rabbit muscle or pig brain. Kinetical analysis of the dephosphorylation of endogenous brain protein indicates that Fc.M could dephosphorylate 32P-labeled myelin basic protein (MBP) and [32P]phosphorylase alpha at a comparable rate and moreover, this associated MBP phosphatase activity was also strictly kinase FA/ATP.Mg-dependent, demonstrating that MBP is a potential substrate for Fc.M in the brain. By manipulating MBP and inhibitor-2 as specific potent phosphorylase phosphatase inhibitors, we further demonstrate that 1) Fc.M contains two distinct catalytic sites to dephosphorylate different substrates, and 2) brain MBP may be a physiological trigger involved in the regulation of protein phosphatase substrate specificity in mammalian nervous tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1557624762,The transcriptional regulation of cya by cAMP and its receptor protein (CRP) has been studied by S1 nuclease and RNA dot blot assays. The crp- Escherichia coli cells were shown to produce about 5-fold more cya mRNA than do the wild type cells. The effect of cAMP and CRP on the cya transcription was directly examined by introducing a crp plasmid into the cells and/or by adding cAMP exogenously. The levels of cya mRNA in crp+ cells decreased with increasing concentrations of cAMP in the growth medium. The repressive effect of cAMP on cya transcription was strongly enhanced in cells carrying a multicopy crp plasmid. These results indicate that the cya transcription is negatively regulated by cAMP-CRP complex in intact cells.

The combining sites of antibodies of each specificity differed among themselves. Three of the five monoclonals were specific for difucosyl and two for monofucosyl A determinants. All but the anti-AB were strictly specific for blood group A or blood group B erythrocytes; all of the anti-A monoclonals gave essentially equivalent titers in hemagglutination tests with A1 and A2 erythrocytes except for a monoclonal anti-A prepared by immunization with a human gastric cancer cell line. The data provide additional evidence for the heterogeneity of the antibody response to the different antigenic determinants present on blood A and B substances and emphasize the importance of difucosyl determinants which comprise most of the determinants on the water-soluble blood group substances."
https://openalex.org/W1516004503,"The identification of transglutaminase in the growth-factor-dependent mouse mast cell line PT18 was accomplished through its characteristic catalytic properties (specificity, calcium dependency, and inhibition by iodoacetamide); and by both immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis using affinity purified antibody. The enzymatic activity in these cells increased in association with the release of histamine from the cells induced by an IgE-dependent mechanism or by exposure to the ionophores A23187 or Br-x537A. The increase in transglutaminase activity was paralleled by a marked increase in the level of protein-bound gamma-glutamylhistamine, determined in radiolabeled form in mast cells that were either metabolically labeled with [3H]histidine or incubated with [3H]histamine before degranulation. The highest level of bound gamma-glutamylhistamine was found in the immunologically stimulated cells. Enzymatic activity and the gamma-glutamyl derivative were associated primarily with the cells, both before and after stimulation. Separation of gamma-glutamylhistamine in a proteolytic digest of these cells was carried out using a combination of ion exchange chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. The gamma-glutamyl compound was identified and quantitated through the enzymatic production of histamine with the use of gamma-glutamylamine cyclotransferase, an enzyme specific for the disassembly of gamma-glutamylamines."
https://openalex.org/W1521839878,"The intracellular transport of chylomicron remnants labeled with [3H]retinyl ester was studied in rat liver parenchymal cells by means of subcellular fractionation in Nycodenz and sucrose density gradients. The data presented indicate that endocytosed chylomicron remnant [3H]retinyl ester initially is located in low density endosomes. Radioactivity is subsequently transferred to a denser vesicle. Equilibrium as well as rate zonal centrifugation suggest that this denser [3H] retinoid-containing vesicle may represent endoplasmic reticulum. We have compared the intracellular transport of chylomicron remnant [3H]retinyl ester and 125I-asialofetuin. The receptor-mediated endocytosis of asialoglycoproteins in rat liver parenchymal cells is a thoroughly studied system. Our results suggest that the [3H] retinoid and 125I-asialofetuin follow the same path initially to the endosomes. After transit in endosomes, the intracellular transport differs. While asialofetuin is transported to the lysosomes, the retinoid is probably transferred to the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1974286777,"Replication of the ColE1 plasmid is regulated by the interaction of its primer RNA with a small countertranscript (RNA I) that acts as a repressor of functional primer formation. The interaction is dependent on the specific conformations of the complementary RNA molecules. Early in its synthesis, primer adopts an ""anti-RNA I"" configuration. As transcription proceeds, it is preempted by formation of an alternative domain designated stem-loop IV. This conformational transition has a significant effect on the rate of association of RNA I with the primer in vitro. Nascent primer in the ""anti-RNA I"" conformation (135 nucleotides) interacts with RNA I 6-fold faster than primer in the stem-loop IV conformation (241 nucleotides), and 35-fold faster than a 567 nucleotide primer precursor. We propose that a conformation-dependent ""window of susceptibility"" of primer to RNA I exists during primer transcription, and that altered conformations play a role in modulating the rate of functional primer formation."
https://openalex.org/W1561897081,"Three cloned apolipoprotein A-II genes were isolated from a human genomic cosmid library constructed in our laboratory. An approximately 3-kilobase HindIII insert containing the entire gene was analyzed by RNA:DNA hybridization and electron microscopy. The apo-A-II gene was found to consist of 4 exons and 3 intervening sequences (IVS), and the lengths of each exon and IVS were estimated by direct observation of the hybrids. The entire approximately 3-kilobase HindIII insert was sequenced. The 5' end of the gene was determined by primer extension. The DNA sequence confirms the presence of 4 exons and 3 IVS: exon 1, 34 nucleotides; exon 2, 76 nucleotides; exon 3, 133 nucleotides; exon 4, 230 nucleotides; IVS-I, 169 nucleotides; IVS-II, 299 nucleotides; and IVS-III, 396 nucleotides. A TATA box is located at position -29 from the CAP site. A CAT box is present at position -78. A TG element consisting of (TG)19 is identified at the 3' end of IVS-III. Furthermore, an enhancer core sequence, CTTTCCA, is identified at position -355 in the 5' flanking sequence. At positions -497 to -471 upstream from the CAP site is a stretch of 27 nucleotides that show high homology to stretches of 5' flanking sequences in the apo-C-II, apo-A-I, apo-E, and apo-C-III genes. An Alu dimer sequence is located approximately 300 nucleotides from the 3' end of the gene. Within this Alu sequence, we have identified a polymorphic MspI site. Restriction fragment length polymorphism involving this site has been previously shown to correlate with apo-A-II levels and high density lipoprotein structure. Analysis of conformation by Chou-Fasman analysis and by the helical hydrophobic moment of Eisenberg et al. (Eisenberg, D., Weiss, R. M., and Tergwillager, T. C. (1982). Nature (Lond.) 299, 371-374) indicates that in all of the 5 apolipoproteins characterized at the nucleotide level to date, i.e. apo-C-II, apo-A-II, apo-E, apo-A-I, and apo-C-III, the 2 IVS within the peptide coding regions of the gene tend to occur at regions corresponding to the surface of the polypeptide chain and divide the protein into distinct functional domains."

https://openalex.org/W2159282095,"The two isozymes of pancreatic amylase in mouse strain YBR/Ki are encoded by closely linked genes which are independently regulated. We have isolated these two pancreatic amylase genes, Amy-2.1 and Amy-2.2, from a cosmid library of YBR/Ki genomic DNA and compared the nucleotide sequences of coding regions with the amino acid sequences of the protein isozymes. Transcripts of both genes were also isolated from a pancreatic cDNA library and partially sequenced. The results demonstrate that Amy-2.1 encodes the A1 isozyme of YBR/Ki pancreatic amylase, while Amy- 2.2 encodes the insulin-dependent B1 isozyme. Similarities of restriction maps and nucleotide sequences suggest that Amy-2.1 is closely related to the active Amy-2a gene previously isolated from strain A/J (Schibler, U., Pittet, A.-C., Young, R. A., Hagenbuchle, O., Tosi, M., Gellman, S., and Wellauer, P. K. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 155, 247-266). Expression of Amy-2.2 may be limited to strain YBR/Ki. The inactive Amy-X gene from A/J (Schibler, U., Pittet, A.-C., Young, R. A., Hagenbuchle, O., Tosi, M., Gellman, S., and Wellauer, P. K. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 155, 247-266) is apparently a null allele of Amy-2.2. An additional amylase gene from YBR/Ki has been identified as a pancreatic amylase pseudogene which diverged between sixteen and thirty-two million years ago. The pancreatic amylase subfamily in strain YBR/Ki thus consists of two active genes and one pseudogene. The low rate of amylase production in YBR/Ki pancreas, relative to that of other inbred strains, can be accounted for by the lower number of gene copies in this strain. Comparison of pancreatic amylase genes from different inbred strains provides evidence for several duplication and deletion events during the recent evolution of this chromosome region."
https://openalex.org/W1552710570,"Apolipoprotein A-II is the second most abundant polypeptide found in human plasma high density lipoprotein particles. The primary translation product of human apo-A-II mRNA is a prepropolypeptide. We have previously reported (Gordon, J. I., Sims, H. F., Edelstein, C., Scanu, A. M., and Strauss, A. W. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 15556-15563) that the prosegment of apo-A-II was removed following export from a human hepatoma cell line (Hep G2). This represented a novel processing compartment for prosegments terminating with paired basic residues and differed from the processing of proalbumin which occurred with high efficiency prior to export from these cells. We have now characterized the enzyme responsible for this extracellular cleavage. The proapo-A-II converting activity is blocked by the thiol protease inhibitors antipain, E-64, leupeptin, and Ala-Lys-Arg chloromethyl ketone. Incubation of 125I-iodotyrosylated Ala-Lys-Arg chloromethyl ketone with serum-free media harvested from cell cultures over a 12-h period revealed a time-dependent accumulation of a 54-kDa protease. Although small quantities of the 54-kDa protease were detected in cell lysates, the major intracellular sequences labeled by the affinity probe had masses of 31.5 and 6 kDa. The 54-kDa extracellular, as well as 31.5- and 6-kDa intracellular, species were all immunoprecipitated by monospecific anti-human liver cathepsin B IgG. Addition of this antibody to media inhibited extracellular conversion of proapo-A-II to the mature protein. Based on these observations, we conclude that a pro cathepsin B-like protease exported by Hep G2 cells is responsible for proapo-A-II prosegment removal. It appears that cathepsin B-like proteases exhibit a complex pattern of segregation within the secretory pathway and that larger molecular weight forms of cathepsin B-like proteases are capable of accurately processing propolypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1528691705,"Rat alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) is an acute-phase protein synthesized in the liver. Using an in vitro translation system coupled with solid-phase radioimmunoassay, alpha 2M mRNA activity was found to rise to a maximum level in 16-24 h after turpentine injection. Poly(A)+ RNA from turpentine-injected rat liver was converted to cDNA by the method of Okayama-Berg, and about 50,000 transformants were obtained. From these transformants, clones containing alpha 2M cDNA were selected using the following criteria: 1) alpha 2M cDNA should hybridize with synthetic oligonucleotides encoding portions of the alpha 2M amino acid sequence, 2) alpha 2M cDNA should hybridize preferentially with RNA which increases during inflammation, 3) mRNA which hybridizes with alpha 2M cDNA should encode a polypeptide which specifically reacts with antibody against alpha 2M, and 4) the cDNA should contain the nucleotide sequences encoding the amino acid sequences of alpha 2M. We found clones which fulfilled these criteria. Using the cDNA clone as a probe, we demonstrated that the level of alpha 2M mRNA in the liver of inflamed animal markedly increased up to 1000-fold. The size of the alpha 2M mRNA was about 4800 nucleotides in length by Northern analysis."

https://openalex.org/W1853417278,"Monoclonal antibodies against chicken erythrocyte histone H5 were produced. Nine hybridomas of different clonal origin were selected, and the antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography. Typing of the antibodies indicated that all but one (IgM) belong to the IgG1 class and contain kappa light chains. Indirect immunoprecipitation, solid-phase radioimmunoassay, and competitive inhibition assays using various H5 fragments revealed that the antigen-binding sites were localized on the central region of H5 (GH5, residues 22-100). Results of immunoblots from gels containing different denaturing agents indicate that some of the antibodies recognize related continuous epitopes localized at the junction of the GH5 with the rest of the molecule. Competition experiments between pairs of the eight different IgGs suggest that they recognize at least seven distinct sites on GH5. The epitopes appear to represent different regions of GH5 although some of them overlap. In general, the antibodies recognize epitopes which are not too accessible to the environment in the native conformation of the histone. All of the antibodies examined, except one of them (5H10), react with nuclei and chromatin from the erythroid cells but not from other cell lines. The site recognized by 5H10 is likely to be one of the regions where GH5 interacts with the nucleosome. No cross-reactivity of the antibodies with other histones including H1, H2A, H2B, H3, H4, and rat liver histone H1(0) was observed."
https://openalex.org/W1529409306,"We demonstrate by agarose gel electrophoresis and DNase I footprinting that Xenopus transcription factor A promotes DNA reassociation. This ability of factor A is dependent upon the domain-like structure of the protein. Digestion of factor A by papain results in a protein fragment which promotes DNA reassociation whereas a smaller fragment obtained by trypsin digestion does not. Although factor A requires zinc for specific binding to the 5 S RNA gene, the metal is not required for single-stranded DNA binding or promotion of DNA reassociation by this protein. The factor A-dependent renaturation of the 5 S RNA gene from its individual 32P end-labeled strands results in the proper gene conformation as evidenced by the restoration of the DNase I footprint characteristic of the intragenic control region. Alterations in DNase I cleavage patterns induced by factor A on the individual 5 S DNA strands are distinct from those induced by the protein on the duplex 5 S RNA gene. The ability of factor A to promote DNA reassociation further defines the possible roles of this protein in the formation of active transcription complexes and their maintenance during repeated rounds of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1494821596,"Glutamine synthetase (Escherichia coli) was incubated with three different reagents that react with lysine residues, viz. pyridoxal phosphate, 5‘-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine, and thiourea dioxide. The latter reagent reacts with the epsilon-nitrogen of lysine to produce homoarginine as shown by amino acid analysis, nmr, and mass spectral analysis of the products. A variety of differential labeling experiments were conducted with the above three reagents to label specific lysine residues. Thus pyridoxal phosphate was found to modify 2 lysine residues leading to an alteration of catalytic activity. At least 1 lysine residue has been reported previously to be modified by pyridoxal phosphate at the active site of glutamine synthetase (Whitley, E. J., and Ginsburg, A. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 7017-7025). By varying the pH and buffer, one or both residues could be modified. One of these lysine residues was associated with approximately 81% loss in activity after modification while modification of the second lysine residue led to complete inactivation of the enzyme. This second lysine was found to be the residue which reacted specifically with the ATP affinity label 5‘-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine. Lys-47 has been previously identified as the residue that reacts with this reagent (Pinkofsky, H. B., Ginsburg, A., Reardon, I., Heinrikson, R. L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 9616-9622; Foster, W. B., Griffith, M. J., and Kingdon, H. S. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 882-886). Thiourea dioxide inactivated glutamine synthetase with total loss of activity and concomitant modification of a single lysine residue. The modified amino acid was identified as homoarginine by amino acid analysis. The lysine residue modified by thiourea dioxide was established by differential labeling experiments to be the same residue associated with the 81% partial loss of activity upon pyridoxal phosphate inactivation. Inactivation with either thiourea dioxide or pyridoxal phosphate did not affect ATP binding but glutamate binding was weakened. The glutamate site was implicated as the site of thiourea dioxide modification based on protection against inactivation by saturating levels of glutamate. Glutamate also protected against pyridoxal phosphate labeling of the lysine consistent with this residue being the common site of reaction with thiourea dioxide and pyridoxal phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1480520385,"The in situ assembly state of the (Na+,K+)-pump ATPase of human erythrocytes was studied by applying the classical target theory to radiation inactivation data of the ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux and ATP hydrolysis. Erythrocytes and their extensively washed white ghosts were irradiated at -45 to -50 degrees C with an increasing dose of 1.5-MeV electron beam, and after thawing, the Na+-pump flux and/or enzyme activities were assayed. Each activity measured was reduced as a simple exponential function of radiation dose, from which a radiation sensitive mass (target size) was calculated. When intact cells were used, the target sizes for the pump and for the ATPase activities were equal and approximately 620,000 daltons. The target size for the ATPase activity was reduced to approximately 320,000 daltons if the cells were pretreated with digitoxigenin. When ghosts were used, the target size for the ATPase activity was again approximately 320,000 daltons. Our target size measurements together with other information available in literature suggest that (Na+,K+)-pump ATPase may exist in human erythrocytes either as a tetramer of alpha beta or as a dimer of alpha beta in tight association with other protein mass, probably certain glycolytic enzymes, and that this tetrameric or heterocomplex association is dissociable by digitoxigenin treatment or by extensive wash during ghost preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1518753346,"Abstract A photoactivatable derivative of human follitropin was used to identify the follitropin receptor on porcine granulosa cells. The hormone was condensed with a heterobifunctional reagent, the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of 4-azidobenzoylglycine, and radioiodinated. The 125I-labeled hormone (125I-hormone) derivative associated with the same number of receptors as 125I-hormone itself, but with a slightly lower Ka, 1.12 X 10(10) M-1 compared with 1.4 X 10(10) M-1 for the 125I-hormone. The binding could be blocked with untreated hormone. Its alpha and beta subunits could be cross-linked to produce alpha beta dimer by photolysis. When the 125I-hormone derivative bound to the cells was photolyzed for crosslinking and the products resolved by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, two new bands (106 and 61 kDa) of lower electrophoretic mobility appeared in addition to the alpha, beta, and alpha beta bands. Formation of these crosslinked complexes required photolysis, and the 125I-hormone derivative specifically bound to cells bearing the receptor. Binding could be blocked by excess untreated follitropin but not with human choriogonadotropin and thyrotropin. Under nonreducing conditions, one major band (104 kDa) of cross-linked complexes appeared. Upon reduction with dithiothreitol and second-dimensional electrophoresis, the 104-kDa band produced two smaller complexes of 75 and 61 kDa, indicating the loss of two components and the existence of intercomponent disulfides. Successful production of the 104-kDa complex requires blocking of free sulfhydryl groups with N-ethylmaleimide. It is, however, independent of various protease inhibitors or the temperature and the time period of hormone incubation with cells or the plasma membrane fraction. The mass estimates and the interaction with the hormone of the photoaffinity-labeled components are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W95483548,"Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is an amphipathic component of Gram-positive bacteria. Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that at low concentrations, ranging from 0.1 to 10.0 micrograms/ml, LTA binds to mammalian cells and stimulates mitogenic responses as demonstrated by increased DNA and RNA synthesis. Tyrosine kinase appears to be involved in the action of a number of mitogens including epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin. In the present study, we report the novel finding that tyrosine protein kinase activity is increased in human fibroblasts treated with LTA. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of the whole cell lysate of fibroblasts cultured with 32Pi showed increased phosphorylation of a 94-kDa polypeptide. Alkali treatment of the gel resulted in a decreased intensity of the 94-kDa phosphorylated protein in control cells, but not in LTA-treated cells, suggesting the addition of phosphate groups to threonine or tyrosine residues. High voltage electrophoresis of the acid hydrolysate of the excised and eluted 94-kDa protein revealed that LTA stimulated the phosphorylation of tyrosine but not threonine residues. These results suggest that LTA acts on mammalian cells by phosphorylating tyrosine residues of certain proteins and thereby may regulate diverse functions of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1506099174,"Induction of the lac operon in wild type Escherichia coli strains results in synthesis of a 16-kDa inner membrane protein in addition to the known products of the lacZ, lacY, and lacA genes. Cells carrying the lacY gene on a multicopy plasmid overproduce this 16-kDa polypeptide as well as the Lac carrier, the membrane protein product of the lacY gene. However, [35S]methionine labeling of minicells carrying the lacY plasmid shows that the 16-kDa protein is not synthesized from the plasmid DNA. We have purified and partially characterized the 16-kDa protein. It is an acidic membrane protein of apparent Mr = 15,800 whose amino-terminal sequence (NH2-Met-Arg-Asn-Phe-Asp-Leu-) does not match any known lac operon DNA sequence. Using antibody prepared to the purified 16-kDa protein, we have quantitatively analyzed conditions under which this protein is made and have shown that the amount of 16-kDa protein which appears in the membrane is proportional to lac operon expression. Hybridization of a synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe complementary to the 5' end of 16-kDa protein mRNA shows that its synthesis is regulated at the level of transcription."
