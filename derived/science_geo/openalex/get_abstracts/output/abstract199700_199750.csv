https://openalex.org/W2079367432,Sterility was induced in both male and female mice following the substitution of D/sub 2/O for a part of the drinking water. Doses of 5 to 30% deuterium oxide were administered. C/sub 57/ and Swiss mice were used and both strain and sex differences in response to D/sub 2/O were noted. No significant differences were noted in litter size or sex ratio from that of the controls. Several physiological mechanisms by which D/sub 2/O produces sterility in mice are suggested. (C.H.)

After this 30- day conditioning period, strontium -90, calcium-45, and insoluble chrominm oxide labeled with Cr/sup 51/ were added to the diets. Four animals from each group were sacrificed after 3, 6, 13, or 24 days on the labeled diet. One femur and a blood sample were assayed for calcium-45 and strontium-80. Total calcium and phosphorus were determined in the second femur. Food consumption was estimated from measurements of chromium-61 in the totnl feces and contents of the gastrointestinal tract. Data are tabulated. Within each dietary group there was a trend toward lower values for the Sr/sup 90//Ca/aup 45/ ratio as time on the labeled diet increased. The effect of dietary calcium levels on strontium-80 bone uptake is discussed. (C.H.)"
