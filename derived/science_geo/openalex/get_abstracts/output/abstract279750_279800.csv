As a nation, we have become sensitive to the social handicaps of race and class but have remained quite insensitive to those imposed because of sex. Those women who have entered the top professional fields have had to have extraordinary motivation, thick skins, exceptional ability, and some unusual pattern of socialization in order to reach their occupational destinations. In their backgrounds one is likely to find a professional mother, an unusually supportive father, or dedicated and stimulating teachers."
https://openalex.org/W2021019698,"In November of 1963 an oceanic volcano produced an island, Surtsey, just off the southern coast of Iceland. The volcanic crater was often flooded with sea water. Vigorous eruptions of steam and tephra were accompanied by an enhancement of the normal fine-weather potential gradient, and lightning was often observed. Measurements of atmospheric electricity and visual and photographic observations lead us to believe that the electrical activity is caused by the ejection from the volcano into the atmosphere of material carrying a large positive charge. The concentration of charge in the eruption plume as it issued from the orifice of the volcano is estimated to be of the order of 10(5) or 10(6) elementary charges per cubic centimeter."

These differences are of two types. In one of these, the cells of the female possess one more chromosome than those of the male; in the other, both sexes possess the same number of chromosomes, but one of the chromosomes in the male is much smaller than the corresponding one in the female (which is in agreement with the observations of Stevens on the beetle Tenebrio). These types may conveniently be designated as A and B, respectively. The essential facts have been determined in three genera of each type, namely (type A), Protenor belfragei, Anasa tristis, and Alydus pilosulus, and (type B), Lygœus turcicus, Euschistus fissilis, and Cœnus delius. The chromosome gro..."
https://openalex.org/W1985899856,"Aflatoxins are absent from freshly harvested peanuts although Aspergillus flavus infest most of the kernels from pods having visible openings. Microbial competition, governed by kernel moisture, limits aflatoxin content of kernels. The toxins are subject to microbial breakdown but the amount broken down is governed by initial aflatoxin concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2032479023,"In October 1964, a detailed geophysical and sampling survey was made of the central part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between 22 degrees and 23 degrees north latitude. The results indicate a large difference in age between the relief of the crest and that of the flanks of the Ridge and suggest that the crest portion is very young. Detailed surveys of two sediment-filled valleys on the upper western flank of the Ridge reveal different sedimentary sequences in the two valleys and indicate the probable existence of a locally controlled depositional regime and a significant local supply of sediment."
https://openalex.org/W2081722337,"Lake Vanda in Victoria Land, Antarctica, is permanently ice-covered and permanently stratified, with warm, salty water near the bottom. Deuterium analyses of lake water from several levels indicate that the lake has a low deuterium content, and that it is stratified with respect to this isotope. This low deuterium content supports the evidence from the lake's ionic content that the saline layer is not of marine origin, and it indicates that evaporation from the ice surface has taken place. The stratification of the lake with respect to deuterium suggests that the upper and lower layers of water were formed at different times from different sources of glacial melt water."
https://openalex.org/W2030411480,"Ice-wedge casts in northern Nova Scotia and the relation of the casts to the outwash that contains them indicate that the ice wedges formed in a permafrost environment after the accumulation of the outwash. This permafrost environment is tentatively correlated with pollen zone L-3 of the Gillis Lake deposit, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, and with the Valders time of the midcontinental sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1966658542,"Many ketones containing an alpha-methylene group can be converted to alpha-diketone radical anions in dimethyl sulfoxide solution. The resulting radical anions can usually be unambiguously identified by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, and the structure of the starting ketone may be deduced, often without reference to model compounds. The technique is also applicable to alpha-diketones, alpha-bromoketones, and alpha-hydroxyketones."

https://openalex.org/W2094430848,"Two measurements of the temperature gradient in salt-marsh peat made at an interval of (1/2) year permit the upward flow of heat to be estimated as 1.37 x 10(-6) cal cm(-2) sec(-1). This value corresponds closely to the average terrestrial heat flow, obtained in mines and wells."

Essentially the recommendations in all three areas can be summed up in a single word-""more."" Specifically, in terms of research, the committee called for ""all appropriate institutions, both private and governmental, to expand their efforts in the whole range of disciplines that contribute to knowledge of population matters, including demography, economics and other social sciences as well as biology, medicine and public health."""
