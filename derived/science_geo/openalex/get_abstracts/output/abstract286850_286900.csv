https://openalex.org/W1986601098,"Solar evolution implies, for contemporary albedos and atmospheric composition, global mean temperatures below the freezing point of seawater less than 2.3 aeons ago, contrary to geologic and paleontological evidence. Ammonia mixing ratios of the order of a few parts per million in the middle Precambrian atmosphere resolve this and other problems. Possible temperature evolutionary tracks for Earth and Mars are described. A runaway greenhouse efect will occur on Earth about 4.5 aeons from now, when clement conditions will prevail on Mars."
https://openalex.org/W1986898463,"At present, acid rain or snow is falling on most of the northeastern United States. The annual acidity value averages about pH 4, but values between pH 2.1 and 5 have been recorded for individual storms. The acidity of precipitation in this region apparently increased about 20 years ago, and the increase may have been associated with the augmented use of natural gas and with the installation of particle-removal devices in tall smokestacks. Only some of the ecological and economic effects of this widespread introduction of strong acids into natural systems are known at present, but clearly they must be considered in proposals for new energy sources and in the development of air quality emission standards."

https://openalex.org/W2011897518,"Spectroscopic measurements have been made of the nitric oxide and water vapor concentrations in the stratosphere at an altitude of 28 kilometers. The measurements, carried out in situ with the use of a spin flip Raman laser, represent the first accurate determination of nitric oxide as a function of time (as the sun rose) from about 6: 30 to 14:00 C.D.T."
https://openalex.org/W1963591362,"Visibly healthy hardwood trees located on poorly drained soils contained high pressures of methane. Heartwood from these trees was water-soaked, neutral to alkaline in pH, fetid in odor, and infested with a diverse population of obligately anaerobic bacteria. the bacterium responsible for methane formation in tree. was isolated and characterized as a member of the genus Methanobacterium."

https://openalex.org/W2009716625,"Gondwanaland at its maximum extent included Tibet, the Tarim Basin block, and parts of northern China. Tibet lay between India and Western Australia as submerged continental crust. The Himalayas are of intracontinental origin. The Tien Shan lie along the former oceanic boundary of Gondwanaland."
https://openalex.org/W2077438978,"The addition of quercetin, an organic flavone (C(15)H(10)O(7)), to aqueous solutions containing silica and aluminum and adjusted to final pH's from 6.5 to 8.5 produced a 1 : 1 alumninosilicate precipitate which, after 6 to 16 months of aging in solution at 25 degrees C, contained as much as 5 percent well-formed kaolinite plates. Similar solutions containing no organic material produced relatively amorphous precipitates with the same composition and stability (standard free energy of formation = -897+/-1 kilocalories per mole) but with substantially smaller amounts of crystaline material even after 2 years of aging."
