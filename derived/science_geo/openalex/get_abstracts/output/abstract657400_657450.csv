These monolayers are usually made by chemical etching that produces flakes with surface defects that have poor air and water stability. Hong et al. report that introducing silicon during chemical vapor deposition growth of molybdenum nitride passivates the surface and prevents island formation. Centimeter-scale monolayer films of the semiconductor MoSi 2 N 4 form as a MoN 2 layer sandwiched by two Si-N bilayers. These layers possess high mechanical strength and ambient stability.

https://openalex.org/W3048006990,"Mapping metal sequences in MOFs Most metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) contain just one type of metal in the nodes connecting the organic linkers. Multivariate MOFs containing multiple metals can offer greater selectivity in sorption and catalytic properties, but determining the arrangement of metals in these materials is challenging. Ji et al. found that atom-probe tomography can reveal sequences of metals for MOF-74 single crystals containing combinations of cobalt, cadmium, lead, and manganese ions. In this MOF, the metals form oxide rods that are connected by the organic linker into a honeycomb lattice. The obtained sequences, which were tuned by varying the proportion of metals and synthesis temperature, could be random, short and long duplicates, and single metal insertions.

However, graft compatibility limits combinations to closely related species, and the mechanism is poorly understood. We found that Nicotiana is capable of graft adhesion with a diverse range of angiosperms. Comparative transcriptomic analyses on graft combinations indicated that a subclade of β-1,4-glucanases secreted into the extracellular region facilitates cell wall reconstruction near the graft interface. Grafting was promoted by overexpression of the β-1,4-glucanase. Using Nicotiana stem as an interscion, we produced tomato fruits on rootstocks from other plant families. These findings demonstrate that the process of cell-cell adhesion is a potential target to enhance plant grafting techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3047901102,"Switching perception of friend and foe Lysine motif receptors in plants perceive glycans that signal the presence of pathogenic or symbiotic nitrogen-fixing microbes. Bozsoki et al. now define the portions of these receptors that create the discriminatory binding pocket (see the Perspective by Bisseling and Geurts). The motifs were conserved in receptors that initiate immune responses, reflecting the invariable nature of the chitin fragments that they sense. Conversely, the motifs in receptors that respond to symbiotic signals were more varied, reflecting the greater diversity of the lipochitooligosaccharides (Nod factors) that they sense. With domain swapping, the authors switched the Nod factor specificity of receptors from two legume species and also enabled a chitin receptor that was otherwise dedicated to the detection of pathogenic microbes to instead recognize Nod factors.

https://openalex.org/W3048216241,"Understanding many physical processes in the solar atmosphere requires determination of the magnetic field in each atmospheric layer. However, direct measurements of the magnetic field in the Sun's corona are difficult to obtain. Using observations with the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter, we have determined the spatial distribution of the plasma density in the corona and the phase speed of the prevailing transverse magnetohydrodynamic waves within the plasma. We combined these measurements to map the plane-of-sky component of the global coronal magnetic field. The derived field strengths in the corona, from 1.05 to 1.35 solar radii, are mostly 1 to 4 gauss. Our results demonstrate the capability of imaging spectroscopy in coronal magnetic field diagnostics."

These molecules are challenging to synthesize chemically. Meanwell et al. developed a “ribose last” synthetic strategy in which a fluorinated acyclic nucleic acid is formed by an l - or d -proline–catalyzed aldol reaction (see the Perspective by Miller). This intermediate can then be cyclized to yield the nucleic acid analog in one pot with control of anomeric conformation based on cyclization conditions. Nucleotide analogs accessible by this strategy include those with modifications at C2′ and C4′, purines and pyrimidines, and locked and protected products.

Previous studies have suggested that gravity or small punctures may play a role in the wrinkling and collapse of viscous bubbles. By studying bubbles with a range of viscosity and by tilting them both sideways and upside down, Oratis et al. conclude that gravity is not a factor. Instead, surface tension and dynamic stress of the compressed liquid seem to be the main driving mechanisms for the behavior of the bubbles and the wrinkling instability. Science , this issue p. 685"

Clinical series describing treatment methods and outcomes for upper abdominal tumors using a 1.5 Tesla MR Linac are lacking. We present the first clinical series of upper abdominal tumors treated using a 1.5 Tesla MR Linac along with the acquisition of intra-treatment quantitative imaging.10 patients with abdominal tumors were treated at our institution. Each patient enrolled in an IRB approved advanced imaging protocol. Both daily real-time adaptive and non-adaptive methods were used, and selection criteria are described. Adaptive plans were based on pre-beam motion-averaged or mid-position images derived from respiratory-correlated 4D-MRI. Quantitative intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging and T2 mapping were acquired during plan adaptation. Real-time motion monitoring using cine MRI was performed during beam-on.Median patient age was 68.2, five patients were female. Tumor types included liver metastatic lesions from melanoma and sarcoma, primary liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and regional abdominal tumors included pancreatic metastatic lesions from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) along with two cases of recurrent pancreatic cancer. Doses included 30 Gy in 6 fractions, 33 Gy in 5 fractions, 50 Gy in 5 fractions, 45 Gy in 3 fractions, and 60 Gy in 3 fractions, depending on the location and clinical circumstances. Treatments were feasible and were successfully completed in all patients without significant acute toxicity, technical complications, or need for back up CT based treatment plans.We present a first clinical series of patients treated for pancreatic tumors, primary liver tumors, and secondary liver tumors with a 1.5 Tesla MR Linear accelerator using adapt-to-position and adapt-to-shape strategies. Treatments were well tolerated by all patients. Acquisition of fully quantitative MR imaging was feasible during the course of the treatment delivery workflow without extending overall treatment times."
https://openalex.org/W3098574587,"Long-range ordering of magnetic dipoles in bulk materials gives rise to a broad range of magnetic structures, from simple collinear ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, to complex magnetic helicoidal textures stabilized by competing exchange interactions. In contrast, in the context of dipolar order in dielectric crystals, only parallel (ferroelectric) and antiparallel (antiferroelectric) collinear alignments of electric dipoles are typically considered. Here, we report an observation of incommensurate helical ordering of electric dipoles by light hole-doping of the quadruple perovskite BiMn7O12. In analogy with magnetism, the electric dipole helicoidal texture is also stabilized by competing instabilities. Specifically, orbital ordering and lone electron pair stereochemical activity compete, giving rise to phase transitions from a non-chiral cubic structure, to an incommensurate electric dipole and orbital helix, via an intermediate density wave."
https://openalex.org/W3047959274,"National efforts to address the diversity dilemma in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) often emphasize increasing numbers of historically underrepresented (HU) students and faculty, but fall short in instituting concrete changes for inclusion and belonging. Therefore, increasing the pool of senior faculty who wish to become guides and advocates for emerging scientists from HU populations is an essential step toward creating new pathways for their career advancement. As a step toward achieving this goal, we created a novel eight-hour intervention on Culturally Aware Mentoring (CAM), a program of the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) targeted to faculty and administrators. A previous report of surveys at the end of the CAM sessions revealed substantial awareness and knowledge gains, with participants expressing intentions to use and implement new skills they had learned. In this paper, we provide the results of our thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with academic administrators and faculty, 18–24 months after participation in CAM. Interviews were designed to determine: 1) What changes in self-perceptions and interactions occurred as a result of participation in CAM? 2) What specific components of CAM are associated with changes in individual beliefs and practices? 3) How did participants actively make changes after the CAM workshop? 4) What barriers or challenges do participants encounter after the CAM intervention? The results demonstrate the lasting influences of CAM on participants’ awareness of cultural differences, their assumptions about and approaches toward interactions with colleagues and students, and their efforts to change their behaviors to promote inclusive practices in their mentoring and teaching of HU students in STEM. Our findings provide evidence that CAM can be incorporated into existing mentor training programs designed to improve the confidence and capacity of senior research faculty mentors to make culturally-informed, scholar-centered decisions to more deliberately recognize and respond to cultural differences within their mentoring and collegial relationships."

Whereas edge rounding and brittle cracking of a blade's hard coating were thought to be responsible, a detailed microstructural investigation by Roscioli et al. shows a different mechanism. A combination of out-of-plane bending, microstructural heterogeneity, and asperities—microscopic chips along the smooth edge—sometimes caused fracture to occur if the conditions lined up. This fracture originated at the hair-edge asperity interface and created chipping that dulled a blade faster than other processes. Science , this issue p. 689"
https://openalex.org/W2963766504,"Background Childhood vaccination plays a key role in reducing morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases. Numerous studies have assessed the influence of demographic and socioeconomic factors on child immunization around the world. There are few such studies in Afghanistan, however. Therefore, this study aimed to identify factors influencing vaccination status among children age 12–23 months in Afghanistan. Materials and methods Nationally representative data from the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey were used for this study. A sample of 5,708 children age 12–23 months with a vaccine card and immunization history was analyzed. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify significant relationships between cofactors and vaccination status. Results In the study, 51% the subjects were boys, 48% were born at home, and 76% were residents of rural areas. Background characteristics positively associated with vaccination status included delivery in a health facility (RRR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.9–3.3), maternal age of 30–39 years (RRR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2–4.1), attending at least four visits for antenatal care (RRR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.7–4.5), health facility visit in the past 12 months (RRR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.4–2.5), paternal professional occupation (RRR = 4.9, 95% CI = 2.0–12.3), family with richer wealth index (RRR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.4–4.1), and living in the northeast region (RRR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2–3.9)were positively associated with vaccination status. Living in the southern region (RRR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.2–0.5) was negatively associated with vaccination status. Conclusion This study identified maternal age, ANC visits, place of delivery, health facility visits in past 12 months, paternal occupation, wealth quintile, and geographic region as the factors influencing child’s vaccination status in Afghanistan."
https://openalex.org/W3047750366,"Background Novel interventions are needed to reach young people and adult men with HIV services given the low HIV testing rates in these population sub-groups. We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a peer-led oral HIV self-testing (HIVST) intervention in Kasensero, a hyperendemic fishing community (HIV prevalence: 37–41%) in Rakai, Uganda. Methods This study was conducted among young people (15–24 years) and adult men (25+ years) between May and August 2019. The study entailed distribution of HIVST kits by trained “peer-leaders,” who were selected from existing social networks and trained in HIVST distribution processes. Peer-leaders received up to 10 kits to distribute to eligible social network members (i.e. aged 15–24 years if young people or 25+ years if adult man, not tested in the past 3 months, and HIV-negative or of unknown HIV status at enrolment). The intervention was evaluated against the feasibility benchmark of 70% of peer-leaders distributing up to 70% of the kits that they received; and the acceptability benchmark of >80% of the respondents self-testing for HIV. Results Of 298 enrolled into the study at baseline, 56.4% (n = 168) were young people (15–24 years) and 43.6% (n = 130) were adult males (25+ years). Peer-leaders received 298 kits and distributed 296 (99.3%) kits to their social network members. Of the 282 interviewed at follow-up, 98.2% (n = 277) reported that they used the HIVST kits. HIV prevalence was 7.4% (n = 21). Of the 57.1% (n = 12) first-time HIV-positives, 100% sought confirmatory HIV testing and nine of the ten (90%) respondents who were confirmed as HIV-positive were linked to HIV care within 1 week of HIV diagnosis. Conclusion Our findings show that a social network-based, peer-led HIVST intervention in a hyperendemic fishing community is highly feasible and acceptable, and achieves high linkage to HIV care among newly diagnosed HIV-positive individuals."

https://openalex.org/W3047747011,"The zebrafish Danio rerio is a valuable and common model for scientists in the fields of genetics and developmental biology. Since zebrafish are also amenable to genetic manipulation, modelling of human diseases or behavioral experiments have moved into the focus of zebrafish research. Consequently, gene expression data beyond embryonic and larval stages become more important, yet there is a dramatic knowledge gap of gene expression beyond day four of development. Like in other model organisms, the visualization of spatial and temporal gene expression by whole mount in situ hybridization (ISH) becomes increasingly difficult when zebrafish embryos develop further and hence the growing tissues become dense and less permeable. Here we introduce a modified method for whole mount ISH, which overcomes these penetration and detection problem. The method is an all in one solution that enables the detection and visualization of gene expression patterns up to the late larval stage in a 3D manner without the need for tissue sectioning and offers a valuable extension for whole mount ISH by immunohistochemistry in the zebrafish field."
https://openalex.org/W3048035799,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplementation with 100ppm sodium monensin or 0.15% of a blend of functional oils (cashew nut oil + castor oil) on the intestinal microbiota of broilers challenged with three different Eimeria spp. The challenge was accomplished by inoculating broiler chicks with sporulated oocysts of Eimeria tenella, Eimeria acervulina, and Eimeria maxima via oral gavage. A total of 864, day-old male broiler chicks (Cobb) were randomly assigned to six treatments (eight pens/treatment; 18 broilers/pen) in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement, composed of three additives (control, monensin or blend), with or without Eimeria challenge. Intestinal contents was collected at 28 days of age for microbiota analysis by sequencing 16s rRNA in V3 and V4 regions using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Taxonomy was assigned through the SILVA database version 132, using the QIIME 2 software version 2019.1. No treatment effects (p > 0.05) were observed in the microbial richness at the family level estimated by Chao1 and the biodiversity assessed by Simpson's index, except for Shannon's index (p < 0.05). The intestinal microbiota was dominated by members of the order Clostridiales and Lactobacillales, followed by the families Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Lactobacillaceae, regardless of treatment. When the controls were compared, in the challenged control group there was an increase in Erysipelotrichaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Peptostreptococcaceae, and a decrease in Ruminococcaceae. Similar results were found for a challenged group that received monensin, while the blend partially mitigated this variation. Therefore, the blend alleviated the impact of coccidiosis challenge on the microbiome of broilers compared to monensin."
https://openalex.org/W3047934553,"Statistical modeling is commonly used to relate the performance of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) to fertilizer requirements. Prescribing optimal nutrient doses is challenging because of the involvement of many variables including weather, soils, land management, genotypes, and severity of pests and diseases. Where sufficient data are available, machine learning algorithms can be used to predict crop performance. The objective of this study was to determine an optimal model predicting nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium requirements for high tuber yield and quality (size and specific gravity) as impacted by weather, soils and land management variables. We exploited a data set of 273 field experiments conducted from 1979 to 2017 in Quebec (Canada). We developed, evaluated and compared predictions from a hierarchical Mitscherlich model, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, neural networks and Gaussian processes. Machine learning models returned R2 values of 0.49–0.59 for tuber marketable yield prediction, which were higher than the Mitscherlich model R2 (0.37). The models were more likely to predict medium-size tubers (R2 = 0.60–0.69) and tuber specific gravity (R2 = 0.58–0.67) than large-size tubers (R2 = 0.55–0.64) and marketable yield. Response surfaces from the Mitscherlich model, neural networks and Gaussian processes returned smooth responses that agreed more with actual evidence than discontinuous curves derived from k-nearest neighbors and random forest models. When conditioned to obtain optimal dosages from dose-response surfaces given constant weather, soil and land management conditions, some disagreements occurred between models. Due to their built-in ability to develop recommendations within a probabilistic risk-assessment framework, Gaussian processes stood out as the most promising algorithm to support decisions that minimize economic or agronomic risks."
https://openalex.org/W3048351128,"Background Approximately 18,000 Syrian refugees have resettled to the United States. Half of these refugees are children, whose age and refugee status jeopardize their abilities to attain quality healthcare. Information on Syrian refugees’ health in the U.S. is limited. This qualitative study sought to explore Syrian refugee parents’ beliefs, perspectives, and practices regarding their children’s health through in-depth interviews. Methods Eighteen Syrian refugee parents residing in Cincinnati, Ohio were interviewed in Arabic by bilingual researchers using semi-structured in-depth interviews. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated. Three members of the research team independently coded each interview using an inductive thematic analysis approach. Results Analysis identified four salient themes: stressors preclude health seeking behaviors, parents perceive health barriers, parents are dissatisfied with the healthcare system, and parents use resilience behaviors to overcome barriers. Stressors included poor housing and neighborhoods, reliving traumatic experiences, depression and anxiety, and social isolation. Dissatisfaction included emergency room wait times, lack of testing and prescriptions. Health barriers included missed appointments and inadequate transportation, translation services, health literacy and care coordination. Parents reported resilience through faith, by seeking knowledge, use of natural remedies, and utilizing community resources. Conclusion This qualitative study provides information on the beliefs, practices, and behaviors of Syrian refugee parents related to health care utilization of pediatric refugees in the United States. Psychosocial and environmental stressors as well as perceived systemic health barriers, hinder health seeking behaviors in Syrian refugee parents. Culturally relevant care targeting perceived barriers and incorporating resilience behaviors may improve parental satisfaction and parental health seeking behaviors. Further study is needed to implement and evaluate interventions that target identified barriers."

We examined whether SM identity enhanced the relationship between experiences of IPV and suicidal ideation/attempts. Weighted logistic regression models were run using the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey. All main effects were significant; each SM identity and both physical and sexual IPV were significantly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. The interaction between bisexual identity and physical IPV was significant for suicidal ideation; as physical IPV experiences increased, the difference between bisexual identity and heterosexual youth was non-significant. Findings suggest exploring trauma and suicidal ideation by aggregate groups and increasing support for SM youth in schools and communities."
https://openalex.org/W3048205169,"The term ""oral frailty"" reflects the fact that oral health is associated with physical frailty and mortality. The gold standard methods for evaluating the swallowing function have several problems, including the need for specialized equipment, the risk of radiation exposure and aspiration, and general physicians not possessing the requisite training to perform the examination. Hence, several simple and non-invasive techniques have been developed for evaluating swallowing function, such as those for measuring tongue pressure and tongue thickness. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between tongue thickness ultrasonography and tongue pressure in the Japanese elderly. We evaluated 254 elderly patients, who underwent tongue ultrasonography and tongue pressure measurement. To determine tongue thickness, we measured the vertical distance from the surface of the mylohyoid muscle to the tongue dorsum using ultrasonography. The results of the analyses revealed that tongue thickness was linearly associated with tongue pressure in both sexes. In male participants, dyslipidemia, lower leg circumference, and tongue pressure were independently and significantly associated with tongue thickness. In female participants, body mass index and tongue pressure were independently and significantly associated with tongue thickness. The optimal cutoff for tongue thickness to predict the tongue pressure of < 20 kPa was 41.3 mm in males, and 39.3 mm in females. In the Japanese elderly, tongue thickness using ultrasonography is associated with tongue pressure. Tongue thickness and tongue pressure, which are sensitive markers for oral frailty, decrease with age. We conclude that tongue ultrasonography provides a less invasive technique for determining tongue thickness and predicts oral frailty for elderly patients."
https://openalex.org/W3047809544,"Hemodialysis catheters are used to support blood filtration, yet there are multiple fundamentally different approaches to catheter tip design with no clear optimal solution. Side-holes have been shown to increase flow rates and decrease recirculation but have been associated with clotting/increased infection rates. This study investigates the impact of changing the shape, size and number of side-holes on a simple symmetric tip catheter by evaluating the velocity, shear stress and shear rate of inflowing blood. A platelet model is used to examine the residence time and shear history of inflowing platelets. The results show that side-holes improve the theoretical performance of the catheters, reducing the maximum velocity and shear stress occurring at the tip compared to non-side-hole catheters. Increasing the side-hole area improved performance up to a point, past which not all inflow through the hole was captured, and instead a small fraction slowly ‘washed-out’ through the remainder of the tip resulting in greater residence times and increasing the likelihood of platelet adhesion. An oval shaped hole presents a lower chance of external fibrin formation compared to a circular hole, although this would also be influenced by the catheter material surface topology which is dependent on the manufacturing process. Overall, whilst side-holes may be associated with increased clotting and infection, this can be reduced when side-hole geometry is correctly implemented though; a sufficient area for body diameter (minimising residence time) and utilising angle-cut, oval shaped holes (reducing shear stress and chances of fibrin formation partially occluding holes)."
https://openalex.org/W3047981275,"Background Major bleedings other than gastrointestinal (GI) and intracranial (ICH) and mortality rates associated with antiplatelet drugs in real-world clinical practice are unknown. The objective was to estimate major bleeding risk and mortality among new users of antiplatelet drugs in real-world clinical practice. Methods and findings A population-based prospective cohort using the French national health data system (SNIIRAM), identified 69,911 adults living within five well-defined geographical areas, who were new users of antiplatelet drugs in 2013–2015 and who had not received any antithrombotics in 2012. Among them, 63,600 started a monotherapy and 6,311 a dual regimen. Clinical data for all adults referred for bleeding was collected from all emergency departments within these areas, and medically validated. Databases were linked using common key variables. The main outcome measure was time to major bleeding (GI, ICH and other bleedings). Secondary outcomes were death, and event-free survival (EFS). Hazard ratios (HR) were derived from adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. We used Inverse Propensity of Treatment Weighting as a stratified sensitivity analysis according to the antiplatelet monotherapy indication: primary prevention without cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, with CV risk factors, and secondary prevention. We observed 250 (0.36%) major haemorrhages, 81 ICH, 106 GI and 63 other types of bleeding. Incidences were twice as high in dual therapy as in monotherapy. Compared to low-dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg daily), high-dose (> 100 up to 325 mg daily) was associated with an increased risk of ICH (HR = 1.80, 95%CI 1.10 to 2.95). EFS was improved by high-dose compared to low-dose aspirin (1.41, 1.04 to 1.90 and 1.32, 1.03 to 1.68) and clopidogrel (1.30, 0.73 to 2.3 and 1.7, 1.24 to 2.34) respectively in primary prevention with and without CV risk factors. Conclusion The incidence of major bleeding and mortality was low. In monotherapy, low-dose aspirin was the safest therapeutic option whatever the indication. Trial registration NCT02886533."
https://openalex.org/W3048259068,"Aquatic macroinvertebrates play a crucial role in freshwater ecosystems, but their diversity remains poorly known, particularly in the tropics. This “taxonomic void” limits our understanding of biodiversity patterns and processes in freshwater ecosystems, and the scale at which they operate. We used DNA barcoding to estimate lineage diversity (and the diversity of unique haplotypes) in 224 specimens of freshwater macroinvertebrates at a small spatial scale within the Panama Canal Watershed (PCW). In addition, we compiled available barcoding data to assess macroinvertebrate diversity at a broader spatial scale spanning the Isthmus of Panama. Consistently across two species delimitation algorithms (i.e., ABGD and GMYC), we found high lineage diversity within the PCW, with ~ 100–106 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) across 168 unique haplotypes. We also found a high lineage diversity along the Isthmus of Panama, but this diversity peaked within the PCW. However, our rarefaction/extrapolation approach showed that this diversity remains under-sampled. As expected, these results indicate that the diversity of Neotropical freshwater macroinvertebrates is higher than previously thought, with the possibility of high endemicity even at narrow spatial scales. Consistent with previous work on aquatic insects and other freshwater taxa in this region, geographic isolation is likely a main factor shaping these patterns of diversity. However, other factors such as habitat variability and perhaps local adaptation might be reshaping these patterns of diversity at a local scale. Although further research is needed to better understand the processes driving diversification in freshwater macroinvertebrates, we suggest that Neotropical streams hold a high proportion of hidden biodiversity. Understanding this diversity is crucial in the face of increasing human disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W3047684871,"Geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in which local inflammation and hyperactivity of the complement pathway have been implicated in its pathophysiology. This study explores whether any surrogate biomarkers are specifically associated with GA. Plasma from subjects with GA, intermediate dry AMD and non-AMD control were evaluated in 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 was assayed in a 320-analyte Luminex library. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric and parametric methods (Kruskal-Wallis, principal component analysis, partial least squares and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and univariate ANCOVAs). Bioinformatic analysis was conducted and identified connections to the amyloid pathway. Statistically significant biomarkers identified in Cohort 1 were then re-evaluated in Cohort 2 using individual ELISA and multiplexing. Of 320 analytes in Cohort 1, 273 were rendered measurable, of which 56 were identified as changing. Among these markers, 40 were identified in univariate ANCOVAs. Serum amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) was analyzed by a separate ELISA and included in further analyses. The 40 biomarkers, sAPP and amyloid-β (Aβ) (1–42) (included for comparison) were evaluated in Cohort 2. This resulted in 11 statistically significant biomarkers, including sAPP and Aβ(1–40), but not Aβ(1–42). Other biomarkers identified included serum proteases- tissue plasminogen activator, tumor-associated trypsinogen inhibitor, matrix metalloproteinases 7 and 9, and non-proteases- insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6, AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, omentin, pentraxin-3 and osteopontin. Findings suggest that there is a preferential processing of APP to Aβ(1–40) over Aβ(1–42), and a potential role for the carboxylase activity of the γ-secretase protein, which preferentially splices sAPPβ to Aβ(1–40). Other markers are associated with the breakdown and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and loss of homeostasis, possibly within the photoreceptor-retinal pigment epithelium-choriocapillaris complex. These data suggest novel disease pathways associated with GA pathogenesis and could provide potential novel targets for treatment of GA."
https://openalex.org/W3048226456,"Severe dengue can be lethal caused by manifestations such as severe bleeding, fluid accumulation and organ impairment. This study aimed to investigate the role of dengue non-structural 1 (NS1) protein and host factors contributing to severe dengue. Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing system was used to investigate the changes in barrier function of microvascular endothelial cells treated NS1 protein and serum samples from patients with different disease severity. Cytokines and metabolites profiles were assessed using a multiplex cytokine assay and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry respectively. The findings showed that NS1 was able to induce the loss of barrier function in microvascular endothelium in a dose dependent manner, however, the level of NS1 in serum samples did not correlate with the extent of vascular leakage induced. Further assessment of host factors revealed that cytokines such as CCL2, CCL5, CCL20 and CXCL1, as well as adhesion molecule ICAM-1, that are involved in leukocytes infiltration were expressed higher in dengue patients in comparison to healthy individuals. In addition, metabolomics study revealed the presence of deregulated metabolites involved in the phospholipid metabolism pathway in patients with severe manifestations. In conclusion, disease severity in dengue virus infection did not correlate directly with NS1 level, but instead with host factors that are involved in the regulation of junctional integrity and phospholipid metabolism. However, as the studied population was relatively small in this study, these exploratory findings should be confirmed by expanding the sample size using an independent cohort to further establish the significance of this study."

Trend forecasts were performed for the 2017–2020 period. A total of 3,212 cases of leprosy were identified, the average incidence among men aged between 30 and 59 years old was 201.55/100,000 inhabitants and among women in the same age group was 135.28/100,000 inhabitants. Detection rates in total and by sex presented a downward trend, though rates stratified according to sex and age presented a growing trend among men aged less than 15 years old and among women aged 60 years old or over. The final models selected in the time-series analysis show the forecasts of total detection rates and rates for men and women presented a downward trend for the 2017–2020 period. Even though the forecasts show a downward trend in Imperatriz, the city is unlikely to meet a significant decrease of the disease burden by 2020."
https://openalex.org/W3047694216,"Aim The present work concerns the comparison of the performances of three systems for dosimetry in RPT that use different techniques for absorbed dose calculation (organ-level dosimetry, voxel-level dose kernel convolution and Monte Carlo simulations). The aim was to assess the importance of the choice of the most adequate calculation modality, providing recommendations about the choice of the computation tool. Methods The performances were evaluated both on phantoms and patients in a multi-level approach. Different phantoms filled with a 177Lu-radioactive solution were used: a homogeneous cylindrical phantom, a phantom with organ-shaped inserts and two cylindrical phantoms with inserts different for shape and volume. A total of 70 patients with NETs treated by PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATOC were retrospectively analysed. Results The comparisons were performed mainly between the mean values of the absorbed dose in the regions of interest. A general better agreement was obtained between Dose kernel convolution and Monte Carlo simulations results rather than between either of these two and organ-level dosimetry, both for phantoms and patients. Phantoms measurements also showed the discrepancies mainly depend on the geometry of the inserts (e.g. shape and volume). For patients, differences were more pronounced than phantoms and higher inter/intra patient variability was observed. Conclusion This study suggests that voxel-level techniques for dosimetry calculation are potentially more accurate and personalized than organ-level methods. In particular, a voxel-convolution method provides good results in a short time of calculation, while Monte Carlo based computation should be conducted with very fast calculation systems for a possible use in clinics, despite its intrinsic higher accuracy. Attention to the calculation modality is recommended in case of clinical regions of interest with irregular shape and far from spherical geometry, in which Monte Carlo seems to be more accurate than voxel-convolution methods."
https://openalex.org/W3047871235,"Paramylon is a novel β-glucan that is stored by Euglena gracilis Z, which is a unicellular photosynthesizing green alga with characteristics of both animals and plants. Recent studies have indicated that paramylon functions as an immunomodulator or a dietary fiber. Currently, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health problem, and there is no effective preventive treatment for CKD progression. However, paramylon may suppress the progression of CKD via the elimination of uremic toxins or modulation of gut microbiota, leading to the alleviation of inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of paramylon in CKD rat model. Eight-week-old male Wistar rats with a 5/6 nephrectomy were given either a normal diet or a diet containing 5% paramylon for 8 weeks. Proteinuria was measured intermittently. Serum and kidney tissues were harvested after sacrifice. We performed a renal molecular and histopathological investigation, serum metabolome analysis, and gut microbiome analysis. The results showed that paramylon attenuated renal function, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury, and podocyte injury in the CKD rat model. Renal fibrosis, tubulointerstitial inflammatory cell infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression levels tended to be suppressed with paramylon treatment. Further, paramylon inhibited the accumulation of uremic toxins, including tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-related metabolites and modulated a part of CKD-related gut microbiota in the CKD rat model. In conclusion, we suggest that paramylon mainly inhibited the absorption of non-microbiota-derived uremic solutes, leading to protect renal injury via anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. Paramylon may be a novel compound that can act against CKD progression."
https://openalex.org/W3048274616,"Background The prognostic value of positive surgical margins after transoral laser microsurgery (TOLM) is still under debate. In case of positive superficial margins, some experts recommend a second-look surgery (SL) and some recommend wait and watch approach with close observation. Narrow band imaging (NBI) is an advanced imaging system used to enhance visualization of mucosal vascular pattern. In laryngology, NBI is used to improve the detection of premalignant, dysplastic and malignant lesions. Aim To assess the usefulness of NBI imaging in guiding clinical decision making regarding follow-up plan and SL after TOLM. Materials and methods A prospective cohort of 127 patients was divided into three groups based on the histology results and NBI vascular pattern of the mucosa. Group A (24/127, 18.90%) consisted of patients with suspicious vascular pattern in NBI or/and with positive deep margin. Group B (52/127, 40.94%) consisted of patients with positive or uncertain superficial margins and non-suspicious vascular pattern in NBI. Group C (51/127, 40.15%) had non-suspicious vascular NBI pattern and all negative margins. Results After the first TOLM procedure, 9/24 (37.5%) patients had positive deep margins, 1/24 (4.2%) had uncertain deep margin and 1/24 patient (4.2%) had both positive deep margin and suspicious vascular pattern in NBI. The remaining 13 cases in Group A had a suspicious NBI finding only during the first follow-up. All of the 24 patients (Group A) underwent a second look surgery. The final histology after SL showed squamous cell carcinoma in 10/24 (41.7%) patients. All 10 patients had suspicious vascular pattern in NBI and one patient had both a positive deep margins after the first TOLM and positive NBI finding. None of Group B and C subjects developed an early recurrence. Conclusions Our study provides evidence that NBI imaging will be a useful adjunct to margin status after TOLM and will facilitate clinical decision-making regarding performing the SL in patients with positive or uncertain superficial surgical margins in the first TOLM procedure. However, additional investigation with more subjects is required at this time to further validate this technique and change the standard of care."
https://openalex.org/W3047911395,"Olfaction plays vital roles in the survival and reproduction of insects. The completion of olfactory recognition requires the participation of various complex protein families. However, little is known about the olfactory-related proteins in Semiothisa cinerearia Bremer et Grey, an important pest of Chinese scholar tree. In this study, we sequenced the antennal transcriptome of S. cinerearia and identified 125 olfactory-related genes, including 25 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), 15 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), two sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs), 52 odorant receptors (ORs), eight gustatory receptors (GRs) and 23 ionotropic receptors (IRs). BLASTX best hit results and phylogenetic analyses indicated that these genes were most identical to their respective orthologs from Ectropis obliqua. Further quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that three ScinOBPs and three ScinORs were highly expressed in male antennae, while seven ScinOBPs and twelve ScinORs were female-specifically expressed. Our study will be useful for the elucidation of olfactory mechanisms in S. cinerearia."
https://openalex.org/W3047752851,"Many susceptibility genes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) and FUT3 genes are related to IBD. This study aimed to investigate whether these genes correlated with the susceptibility to AS. Questionnaires of 673 patients with AS, and peripheral blood specimens of the patients and 687 healthy controls were collected. FUT2 and FUT3 genes were genotyped using the SNPscan method. Frequency differences of the genes at different levels, haplotypes, and interactions were analyzed. No frequency differences were found between the cases and the controls in all the genotypes and the alleles of rs1047781, rs1800028, rs1800030, and rs812936. For rs28362459, a significant difference in allele frequencies was observed in the total participants between the groups [χ2 = 7.515, Pcorrected = 0.030; adjusted odds ratio (ORadjusted)G/T = 0.782; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.650–0.941]. The frequencies of haplotypes TT (rs812936–rs28362459) (χ2 = 5.663, Ppermutation = 0.039) and TG (rs812936–rs28362459) (χ2 = 7.456, Ppermutation = 0.013) in the total participants, and TG (rs812936–rs28362459) in the female subgroup (χ2 = 5.624, Ppermutation = 0.047) showed significant differences between the cases and the controls. No frequency differences at the phenotypic level were found. Two-factor interactions were observed between rs28362459-TG and age, rs28362459-TG and sex, rs28362459 and rs1047781, and the Lewis and secretor status. Rs28362459-G was related to some aggravated symptoms of AS (all Pcorrected < 0.05). These findings indicated that FUT3 polymorphisms were associated with human predisposition to AS at the allele and haplotype level. Rs28362459-G might decrease the susceptibility to AS, but aggravate relevant symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3048246351,"Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are a valuable animal model used in biomedical research. Like many animals, ferrets undergo significant variation in body weight seasonally, affected by photoperiod, and these variations complicate the use weight as an indicator of health status. To overcome this requires a better understanding of these seasonal weight changes. We provide a normative weight data set for the female ferret accounting for seasonal changes, and also investigate the effect of fluid regulation on weight change. Female ferrets (n = 39) underwent behavioural testing from May 2017 to August 2019 and were weighed daily, while housed in an animal care facility with controlled light exposure. In the winter (October to March), animals experienced 10 hours of light and 14 hours of dark, while in summer (March to October), this contingency was reversed. Individual animals varied in their body weight from approximately 700 to 1200 g. However, weights fluctuated with light cycle, with animals losing weight in summer, and gaining weight in winter such that they fluctuated between approximately 80% and 120% of their long-term average. Ferrets were weighed as part of their health assessment while experiencing water regulation for behavioural training. Water regulation superimposed additional weight changes on these seasonal fluctuations, with weight loss during the 5-day water regulation period being greater in summer than winter. Analysing the data with a Generalised Linear Model confirmed that the percentage decrease in weight per week was relatively constant throughout the summer months, while the percentage increase in body weight per week in winter decreased through the season. Finally, we noted that the timing of oestrus was reliably triggered by the increase in day length in spring. These data establish a normative benchmark for seasonal weight variation in female ferrets that can be incorporated into the health assessment of an animal’s condition."
https://openalex.org/W3048248228,"Current antidepressant therapy has several disadvantages related to the properties of antidepressants. Considering their unfavourable features, the process of searching for new antidepressant drugs with better safety and tolerability requires consistent efforts and many complementary studies. Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor is considered as an interesting target of antidepressant therapy. In the present study, the intrinsic activity at different signaling pathways coupled to serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, antidepressant-like and pharmacokinetic properties, and the safety profile of two novel imidazopurine-2,4-dione derivatives, namely compounds AZ-853 (8-(4-(4-(2-fluorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-1,3-dimethyl-1H- imidazo[2,1-f]purine-2,4(3H,8H)-dione) and AZ-861 (1,3-dimethyl-8-(4-(4-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-1H-imidazo[2,1-f]purine-2,4(3H,8H)-dione), were studied in animal models through in vitro and in vivo experiments. We demonstrated that AZ-853 and AZ-861, which structurally differ by one substituent and its placement in the phenyl ring, showed varied functional, pharmacological, and pharmacokinetic properties as well as side effect profiles. AZ-861 exhibited stronger agonistic action in all functional assays. After acute and repeated administration in mice, both compounds showed antidepressant-like activity in the forced swim test, which was partially mediated by 5-HT1A receptor activation. AZ-853 showed a more potent antidepressant-like effect, presumably due to its better penetration into brain structures. Both compounds did not show anticholinergic properties, but after repeated administration, they induced weak sedation and lipid metabolism disturbances without affecting serum glucose level. The stronger α1-adrenolytic effect of AZ-853 is responsible for decreased systolic blood pressure, and in contrast to AZ-861, AZ-853 induced weight gain in mice. The interesting comparative pharmacological profiles of AZ-853 and AZ-861 encourage to conduct further experiments to fully understand their mechanisms and differences in action."
https://openalex.org/W3047669776,"Various marine fungi have been shown to produce interesting, bioactive compounds, but scaling up the production of these compounds can be challenging, particularly because little is generally known about how the producing organisms grow. Here we assessed the suitability of using 100-well BioScreen plates or 96-well plates incubated in a robot hotel to cultivate eight filamentous marine fungi, six sporulating and two non-sporulating, to obtain data on growth and substrate (glucose, xylose, galactose or glycerol) utilisation in a high throughput manner. All eight fungi grew in both cultivation systems, but growth was more variable and with more noise in the data in the Cytomat plate hotel than in the BioScreen. Specific growth rates between 0.01 (no added substrate) and 0.07 h-1 were measured for strains growing in the BioScreen and between 0.01 and 0.27 h-1 for strains in the plate hotel. Three strains, Dendryphiella salina LF304, Penicillium chrysogenum KF657 and Penicillium pinophilum LF458, consistently had higher specific growth rates on glucose and xylose in the plate hotel than in the BioScreen, but otherwise results were similar in the two systems. However, because of the noise in data from the plate hotel, the data obtained from it could only be used to distinguish between substrates which did or did not support growth, whereas data from BioScreen also provided information on substrate preference. Glucose was the preferred substrate for all strains, followed by xylose and galactose. Five strains also grew on glycerol. Therefore it was important to minimise the amount of glycerol introduced with the inoculum to avoid misinterpreting the results for growth on poor substrates. We concluded that both systems could provide physiological data with filamentous fungi, provided sufficient replicates are included in the measurements."
https://openalex.org/W3047710930,"Thrombin, a key enzyme of the clotting system, is involved in thrombus formation, platelet activation, and atherosclerosis, thereby possessing a central role in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease. Studies have shown an association between thrombin generation (TG) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but results have been equivocal. Our aim was to study the predictive ability of TG assay in evaluating coronary stenosis severity.In this prospective study we recruited patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or acute chest pain (without evidence of myocardial injury) planned for coronary angiography. Thrombin generation was evaluated by Calibrated Automated Thrombogram (CAT) prior to angiography. Primary end points were significant coronary stenosis and the Syntax I score evaluated by coronary angiography.From April 2018 through September 2019, we recruited 128 patients. In the primary analysis there was no significant association between TG and significant coronary stenosis nor between TG and syntax I score, however, there was a positive correlation between peak height and troponin peak (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.194, P-value = 0.035). In sub-group analysis, the chest pain group bare no association between TG and coronary stenosis. In unstable angina group there was an association between peak height and significant coronary stenosis (P-value = 0.029), and in non ST-elevation myocardial infarction group, TG values possessed a relatively good predictive ability of significant coronary stenosis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of ~65%) and a positive correlation between both lag time and ttpeak with the syntax I score was noticed (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.31, P-value = 0.099 and Spearman correlation coefficient 0.37, P-value = 0.045 respectively).In patients with acute chest pain, TG values, evaluated by CAT, do not predict severity of coronary stenosis, nor do they possess prognostic value. Yet, in ACS patients, TG may have the ability to predict coronary disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W3047826488,"The aims of this study were to predict the potential distribution of two introduced Mustelidae, Mustela nivalis and M. putorius in the Azores archipelago (Portugal), and evaluate the relative contribution of environmental factors from native and introduced ranges to predict species distribution ranges in oceanic islands. We developed two sets of Species Distribution Models using MaxEnt and distribution data from the native and introduced ranges of the species to project their potential distribution in the archipelago. We found differences in the predicted distributions for the models based on introduced and on native occurrences for both species, with different most important variables being selected. Climatic variables were most important for the introduced range models, while other groups of variables (i.e., human-disturbance) were included in the native-based models. Most of the islands of the Azorean archipelago were predicted to have suitable habitat for both species, even when not yet occupied. Our results showed that predicting the invaded range based on introduced range environmental conditions predicted a narrower range. These results highlight the difficulty to transfer models from native to introduced ranges across taxonomically related species, making it difficult to predict future invasions and range expansion."
https://openalex.org/W3047912768,"In bovine mammary glands, the ABCG2 transporter actively secretes xenobiotics into dairy milk. This can have significant implications when cattle are exposed to pesticide residues in feed. Recent studies indicate that the fungicide prochloraz activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway, increasing bovine ABCG2 (bABCG2) gene expression and efflux activity. This could enhance the accumulation of bABCG2 substrates in dairy milk, impacting pesticide risk assessment. We therefore investigated whether 13 commonly used pesticides in Europe are inducers of AhR and bABCG2 activity. MDCKII cells expressing mammary bABCG2 were incubated with pesticides for up to 72 h. To reflect an in vivo situation, applied pesticide concentrations corresponded to the maximum residue levels (MRLs) permitted in bovine fat or muscle. AhR activation was ascertained through CYP1A mRNA expression and enzyme activity, measured by qPCR and 7-ethoxyresorufin-Ο-deethylase (EROD) assay, respectively. Pesticide-mediated increase of bABCG2 efflux activity was assessed using the Hoechst 33342 accumulation assay. For all assays, the known AhR-activating pesticide prochloraz served as a positive control, while the non-activating tolclofos-methyl provided the negative control. At 10-fold MRL concentrations, chlorpyrifos-methyl, diflufenican, ioxynil, rimsulfuron, and tebuconazole significantly increased CYP1A1 mRNA levels, CYP1A activity, and bABCG2 efflux activity compared to the vehicle control. In contrast, dimethoate, dimethomorph, glyphosate, iprodione, methiocarb and thiacloprid had no impact on AhR-mediated CYP1A1 mRNA levels, CYP1A activity or bABCG2 efflux. In conclusion, the MDCKII-bABCG2 cell model proved an appropriate tool for identifying AhR- and bABCG2-inducing pesticides. This provides an in vitro approach that could reduce the number of animals required in pesticide approval studies."
https://openalex.org/W3047949121,"Exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke is associated with the development of diverse diseases. Resistance training has been considered one of the most useful tools for patients with pulmonary disease, improving their quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of resistance training (RT) on the prevention of thickening of the right ventricle wall of rats exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke. Thirty-two Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Control (C), Smoker (S), Exercised (E) and Exercised Smoker (ES). The smoker groups were exposed to the smoke of four cigarettes for 30 min, twice daily, five days a week, for 16 weeks. The exercised groups climbed on a vertical ladder with progressive load, once a day, five days a week, for 16 weeks. The heart, trachea, lung, liver and gastrocnemius muscle were removed for histopathological analysis. Pulmonary emphysema (S and ES vs C and E, P < 0.0001) and pulmonary artery thickness enlargement (S vs C and E, P = 0.003, ES vs C, P = 0.003) were detected in the smoking groups. There was an increase in the right ventricle thickness in the S group compared with all other groups (P < 0.0001). An increase in resident macrophages in the liver was detected in both smoking groups compared with the C group (P = 0.002). Additionally, a relevant reduction of the diameter of the muscle fibers was detected only in ES compared with the C, S and E groups (P = 0.0002), impairing, at least in part, the muscle mass in exercised smoking rats. Therefore, it was concluded that resistance training prevented the increase of thickness of the right ventricle in rats exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke, but it may be not so beneficial for the skeletal muscle of smoking rats."

However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We examined whether biomarkers for metabolism and inflammation during pregnancy were associated with maternal health and with child biomarkers and health at 9-12 years of age in 44 maternal-child dyads from the Supplementation with Multiple Micronutrients Intervention Trial (SUMMIT, ISRCTN34151616) in Lombok, Indonesia. Archived blood for each dyad from maternal enrollment, later in pregnancy, postpartum, and from children at 9-12 years comprised 132 specimens. Multiplex microbead immunoassays were used to quantify vitamin D-binding protein (D), adiponectin (A), retinol-binding protein 4 (R), C-reactive protein (C), and leptin (L). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed distinct variance patterns, i.e. principal components (PC), for baseline pregnancy, bp.pc1.D↓A↓R↓ and bp.pc2.C↓L↑; combined follow-up during pregnancy and postpartum, dp-pp.pc1.D↑↓A↑R↑↓L↓ and dp-pp.pc2.A↑C↑L↑; and children, ch.pc1.D↑R↑C↑ and ch.pc2.D↓A↑L↑. Maternal multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation led to an association of baseline maternal bp.pc2.C↓L↑ with decreased post-supplementation maternal dp-pp.pc2.A↑C↑L↑ (p = 0.022), which was in turn associated with both increased child ch.pc1.D↑R↑C↑ (p = 0.036) and decreased child BMI z-score (BMIZ) (p = 0.022). Further analyses revealed an association between maternal dp-pp.pc1.D↑↓A↑R↑↓L↓ and increased child BMIZ (p = 0.036). Child ch.pc1.D↑R↑C↑ was associated with decreased birth weight (p = 0.036) and increased child BMIZ (p = 0.002). Child ch.pc2.D↓A↑L↑ was associated with increased child BMIZ (p = 0.005), decreased maternal height (p = 0.030) and girls (p = 0.002). A pattern of elevated maternal adiponectin and leptin in pregnancy was associated with increased C-reactive protein, vitamin A, and D binding proteins pattern in children, suggesting biomarkers acting in concert may have qualitative as well as quantitative influence beyond single biomarker effects. Patterns in pregnancy proximal to birth were more associated with child status. In addition, child patterns were more associated with child status, particularly child BMI. MMN supplementation affects maternal biomarker patterns of metabolism and inflammation in pregnancy, and potentially in the child. However, child nutrition conditions after birth may have a greater impact on metabolism and inflammation."

An analysis of Google Trends revealed that Mental health searches increased in volume starting in the beginning of the current decade. Notably, both ""mental health"" and ""gun(s)"" were searched with greater frequency the week after the mass shooting events occurred. Related searches after the event also observed a significant increase in interest in mental health and gun regulation, legal reform, mass shootings, and gun(s).

https://openalex.org/W3047806326,"The H196 residue in SIVmac239 Nef is conserved across the majority of HIV and SIV isolates, lies immediately adjacent to the AP-2 (adaptor protein 2) binding di-leucine domain (ExxxLM195), and is critical for several described AP-2 dependent Nef functions, including the downregulation of tetherin (BST-2/CD317), CD4, and others. Surprisingly, many stocks of the closely related SIVmac251 swarm virus harbor a nef allele encoding a Q196. In SIVmac239, this variant is associated with loss of multiple AP-2 dependent functions. Publicly available sequences for SIVmac251 stocks were mined for variants linked to Q196 that might compensate for functional defects associated with this residue. Variants were engineered into the SIVmac239 backbone and in Nef expression plasmids and flow cytometry was used to examine surface tetherin expression in primary CD4 T cells and surface CD4 expression in SupT1 cells engineered to express rhesus CD4. We found that SIVmac251 stocks that encode a Q196 residue in Nef uniformly also encode an upstream R191 residue. We show that R191 restores the ability of Nef to downregulate tetherin in the presence of Q196 and has a similar but less pronounced impact on CD4 expression. However, a published report showed Q196 commonly evolves to H196 in vivo, suggesting a fitness cost. R191 may represent compensatory evolution to restore the ability to downregulate tetherin lost in viruses harboring Q196."
https://openalex.org/W3048289901,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical early step in cancer metastasis and a complex process that involves multiple factors. In this study, we used proteomics approaches to investigate the secreted proteins (secretome) of paired human androgen-repressed prostate cancer (ARCaP) cell lines, representing the epithelial (ARCaP-E) and mesenchymal (ARCaP-M) phenotypes. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses showed high levels of proteins involved in bone remodeling and extracellular matrix degradation in the ARCaP-M cells, consistent with the bone metastasis phenotype. Furthermore, LC-MS/MS showed a significantly higher level of the serine protease granzyme B (GZMB) in ARCaP-M conditioned media (CM) compared to that of ARCaP-E. Using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect mRNA and Western blot to detect protein expression, we further demonstrated that the GZMB gene was expressed by ARCaP-M and the protein was secreted extracellularly. ARCaP-M cells with GZMB gene knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) have markedly reduced invasiveness as demonstrated by the Matrigel invasion assay in comparison with the scrambled siRNA negative control. This study reports that GZMB secretion by mesenchymal-like androgen-repressed human prostate cancer cells promotes invasion, suggesting a possible extracellular role for GZMB in addition to its classic role in immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3047827295,"Purpose To investigate the association between daily sunlight exposure duration and diabetic retinopathy in Korean adults with diabetes. Methods This study used data from the 2008–2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Overall, 1,089 patients with diabetes aged >40 years were included. The duration of daily sunlight exposure was assessed via health interviews. Comprehensive ophthalmic evaluations, including standard retinal fundus photography after pupil dilation, were conducted. Diabetic retinopathy was graded using the modified Airlie House Classification. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the association between daily sunlight exposure duration and the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Results The risk of diabetic retinopathy was 2.66 times higher in the group with ≥5 h of daily sunlight exposure than in the group with less exposure after adjusting for risk factors such as duration of diabetes, serum hemoglobin A1c level, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (P = 0.023). Furthermore, the risk of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy was 3.13 times higher in the group with ≥5 h of daily sunlight exposure than in the group with less exposure (P = 0.009). In patients with diabetes for <10 years, the risks of diabetic retinopathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy were 4.26 and 4.82 times higher in the group with ≥5 h of daily sunlight exposure than the group with less exposure, respectively (P < 0.05). Conclusions This study revealed that sunlight exposure for ≥5 h a day was significantly associated with an increased risk of diabetic retinopathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in Korean patients with diabetes. The risks were significantly higher in patients with diabetes for <10 years. Therefore, reducing daily sunlight exposure could be an early preventive strategy against diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3047856209,"Electrical stimulation of nerve endings in the tongue can be used to communicate information to users and has been shown to be highly effective in sensory substitution applications. The anterior tip of the tongue has very small somatosensory receptive fields, comparable to those of the finger tips, allowing for precise two-point discrimination and high tactile sensitivity. However, perception of electrotactile stimuli varies significantly between users, and across the tongue surface. Despite this, previous studies all used uniform electrode grids to stimulate a region of the dorsal-medial tongue surface. In an effort to customize electrode layouts for individual users, and thus improve efficacy for sensory substitution applications, we investigated whether specific neuroanatomical and physiological features of the tongue are associated with enhanced ability to perceive active electrodes. Specifically, the study described here was designed to test whether fungiform papillae density and/or propylthiouracil sensitivity are positively or negatively associated with perceived intensity and/or discrimination ability for lingual electrotactile stimuli. Fungiform papillae number and distribution were determined for 15 participants and they were exposed to patterns of electrotactile stimulation (ETS) and asked to report perceived intensity and perceived number of stimuli. Fungiform papillae number and distribution were then compared to ETS characteristics using comprehensive and rigorous statistical analyses. Our results indicate that fungiform papillae density is correlated with enhanced discrimination ability for electrical stimuli. In contrast, papillae density, on average, is not correlated with perceived intensity of active electrodes. However, results for at least one participant suggest that further research is warranted. Our data indicate that propylthiouracil taster status is not related to ETS perceived intensity or discrimination ability. These data indicate that individuals with higher fungiform papillae number and density in the anterior medial tongue region may be better able to use lingual ETS for sensory substitution."
https://openalex.org/W3048011260,"Opticin is a class III member of the extracellular matrix small leucine-rich repeat protein/proteoglycan (SLRP) family found in vitreous humour and cartilage. It was first identified associated with the surface of vitreous collagen fibrils and several other SLRPs are also known to bind collagen fibrils and it some cases alter fibril morphology. The purpose of this study was to investigate the binding of opticin to the collagen II-containing fibrils found in vitreous and cartilage. Electron microscopic studies using gold labelling demonstrated that opticin binds vitreous and thin cartilage collagen fibrils specifically at a single site in the gap region of the collagen D-period corresponding to the e2 stain band; this is the first demonstration of the binding site of a class III SLRP on collagen fibrils. Opticin did not bind thick cartilage collagen fibrils from cartilage or tactoids formed in vitro from collagen II, but shows high specificity for thin, heterotypic collagen fibrils containing collagens II, and XI or V/XI. Vitreous collagen fibrils from opticin null and wild-type mice were compared and no difference in fibril morphology or diameter was observed. Similarly, in vitro fibrillogenesis experiments showed that opticin did not affect fibril formation. We propose that when opticin is bound to collagen fibrils, rather than influencing their morphology it instead hinders the binding of other molecules to the fibril surfaces and/or act as an intermediary bridge linking the collagen fibrils to other non-collagenous molecules."

In this study, we utilized genomes of Xenopus laevis (XLA, a tetraploid species with (L) and (S) sub-genomes) and X. tropicalis (XTR, a diploid species) to investigate whether synonymous substitution rates among orthologous or homoeologous genes displayed any heterogeneity. From over 1500 orthologous/homoeologous genes collected, we calculated proportion of synonymous substitutions between genomes/sub-genomes (k) and found variation within and between chromosomes. Within most chromosomes, we identified higher k with distance from the centromere, likely attributed to higher substitution rates and recombination in these regions. Using maximum likelihood methods, we identified further evidence supporting rate heterogeneity, and estimated species divergence times and ancestral population sizes. Estimated species divergence times (XLA.L-XLA.S: ~25.5 mya; XLA-XTR: ~33.0 mya) were slightly younger compared to a past study, attributed to consideration of population size in our study. Meanwhile, we found very large estimated population size in the ancestral populations of the two species (NA = 2.55 x 106). Local hybridization and population structure, which have not yet been well elucidated in frogs, may be a contributing factor to these possible large population sizes."
