https://openalex.org/W2088257607,"Quantitative analytical methods are used to reconstruct the course of events during and after the cataclysmic eruption of Mount Tambora, Indonesia, on 10 and 11 April 1815. This was the world's greatest ash eruption (so far as is definitely known) since the end of the last Ice Age. This synthesis is based on data and methods from the fields of volcanology, oceanography, glaciology, meteorology, climatology, astronomy, and history."
https://openalex.org/W1992984696,"Up to 60 percent of the total marine primary production (or about one-fourth of the total global carbon dioxide fixation) passes through the free-living bacterioplankton. Grazing by bacteriovores is probably the predominant fate of the bacteria, although data are scarce. Evidence is presented that previously uncharacterized, small eukaryotes that are able to pass even 0.6-micrometer filters may be responsible for a large fraction (more than 50 percent) of the total grazing in coastal waters. These organisms have not yet been observed microscopically."
https://openalex.org/W2065908525,"Satellite infrared temperature images illustrate several effects of the 1982-1983 El Niño: warm sea-surface temperatures with the greatest anomalies near the coast, weakened coastal upwelling, and changes in surface circulation patterns. Phytoplankton pigment images from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner indicate reduced productivity during El Niño, apparently related to the weakened coastal upwelling The satellite images provide direct evidence of mesoscale changes associated with the oceanwide El Niño event."

https://openalex.org/W2056440230,"This article reports measurements of the column density of stratospheric chlorine monoxide and presents a complete diurnal record of its variation (with 2-hour resolution) obtained from ground-based observations of a millimeter-wave spectral line at 278 gigahertz. Observations were carried out during October and December 1982 from Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The results reported here indicate that the mixing ratio and column density of chlorine monoxide above 30 kilometers during the daytime are approximately 20 percent lower than model predictions based on 2.1 parts per billion of total stratospheric chlorine. The observed day-to-night variation of chlorine monoxide is, however, in good agreement with recent model predictions, confirms the existence of a nighttime reservoir for chlorine, and verifies the predicted general rate of its storage and retrieval. From this evidence, it appears that the chlorine chemistry above 30 kilometers is close to being understood in current stratospheric models. Models based on this chemistry and measured reaction rates predict a reduction in the total stratospheric ozone content in the range of 3 to 5 percent in the final steady state for an otherwise unperturbed atmosphere, although the percentage decrease in the upper stratosphere is much higher."
https://openalex.org/W1986431809,"A simple model for spark-ignited engines is proposed in which the residual exhaust gases of a combustion event affect ignition of the subsequent charge. The model is an example of a one-dimensional, discrete, nonlinear mapping of an interval. Laminar flame correlations incorporated within models for ignition exhibit Arrhenius kinetics. Small variations of the ignition time with respect to the expansion cycle alter the work produced by each cycle, thereby altering the exhaust-gas temperature. It is shown that the mixing of hot residual gases with a fresh charge is a sufficient mechanism to produce an instability of the ignition process, resulting in oscillatory behavior. When this instability is compounded with the effects of mixture turbulence, one obtains a novel picture of the well-known phenomenon of ""cyclic dispersion"" exhibited by such engines."

Direct deposition in the fecal pellets of certain zooplankton species may explain the presence of dihydrophytol in marine sediments. Microbial reduction of phytol in sediment cores does not account for the origin of this compound in all sedimentary environments."

https://openalex.org/W2015540997,"When Laminaria is exposed to the action of anesthetics (in sufficient concentration to produce any result) there is an increase in respiration. This may be followed by a decrease if the reagent is sufficiently toxic. No decrease is observed with low concentrations which are not toxic. These facts contradict the theory of Verworn that anesthesia is a kind of asphyxia, for his view is based upon the assumption that anesthetics decrease respiration."
